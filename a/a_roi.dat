2500|$|On {{his return}} to Sweden, Gustav III tried to mediate between the bitterly divided Hat and Cap parties. On 21 June 1771, he opened his first Riksdag with a speech that aroused {{powerful}} emotions. It {{was the first time}} in more than a century that a Swedish king had addressed a Swedish Riksdag in its native tongue. He stressed the need for all parties to sacrifice their animosities for the common good, and volunteered, as [...] "the first citizen of a free people," [...] to be the mediator between the contending factions. A composition committee was actually formed, but it proved illusory from the first: the patriotism of neither faction was sufficient for the smallest act of self-denial. The subsequent attempts of the dominant Caps to reduce him to <b>a</b> <b>roi</b> fainéant (a powerless king), encouraged him to consider a coup d'état.|$|E

60|$|And {{these lines}} contain, {{if not the}} best {{criticism}} of his own work, certainly a very complete statement of his aim and motive as a poet. His little Book of Verses reveals to us an artist who is seeking to find new methods of expression and has not merely a delicate sense of beauty and a brilliant, fantastic wit, but a real passion also for what is horrible, ugly, or grotesque. No doubt, everything that is worthy of existence is worthy also of art--at least, one {{would like to think}} so--but while echo or mirror can repeat for us a beautiful thing, to render artistically a thing that is ugly requires the most exquisite alchemy of form, the most subtle magic of transformation. To me there is more of the cry of Marsyas than of the singing of Apollo in the earlier poems of Mr. Henley's volume, In Hospital: Rhymes and Rhythms, as he calls them. But it is impossible to deny their power. Some of them are like bright, vivid pastels; others like charcoal drawings, with dull blacks and murky whites; others like etchings with deeply-bitten lines, and abrupt contrasts, and clever colour-suggestions. In fact, they are like anything and everything, except perfected poems--that they certainly are not. They are still in the twilight. They are preludes, experiments, inspired jottings in a note-book, and should be heralded by a design of 'Genius Making Sketches.' Rhyme gives architecture as well as melody to verse; it gives that delightful sense of limitation which in all the arts is so pleasurable, and is, indeed, one of the secrets of perfection; it will whisper, as a French critic has said, 'things unexpected and charming, things with strange and remote relations to each other,' and bind them together in indissoluble bonds of beauty; and in his constant rejection of rhyme, Mr. Henley seems to me to have abdicated half his power. He is <b>a</b> <b>roi</b> en exil who has thrown away some of the strings of his lute; a poet who has forgotten the fairest part of his kingdom.|$|E

5000|$|A {{region of}} {{interest}} (often abbreviated ROI), are samples within an data set identified for a particular purpose. The concept of <b>a</b> <b>ROI</b> is commonly used in many application areas. For example, in medical imaging, the boundaries of a tumor may be defined on an image or in a volume, {{for the purpose of}} measuring its size. The endocardial border may be defined on an image, perhaps during different phases of the cardiac cycle, for example end-systole and end-diastole, for the purpose of assessing cardiac function. In geographical information systems (GIS), <b>a</b> <b>ROI</b> can be taken literally as a polygonal selection from a 2D map. In computer vision and optical character recognition, the ROI defines the borders of an object under consideration. In many applications, symbolic (textual) labels are added to <b>a</b> <b>ROI,</b> to describe its content in a compact manner.

5000|$|In the Emperor format, two teams, each {{generally}} {{composed of}} three players, play {{to ensure their}} central player (the [...] "Emperor") outlasts the other.

After teams have been selected Emperors are decided in the same fashion. Range of influence is a standard rule enforced upon each emperor during a game. It is widely debated what a fair range of influence is and should be discussed before the match. (Example: An Emperor with <b>a</b> <b>ROI</b> of 1 can only cast spells and abilities as far as 1 player to his left or right. <b>A</b> <b>ROI</b> of 2 enables targeting of 2 players left or right.

This was primarily aimed at the common man, since harems and concubines were common amongst the ruling classes.

50|$|This much-neglected Arthurian epic {{does not}} fit {{into any of the}} {{recognized}} categories of Arthurian literature and is therefore a literary form in its own right; as such it possesses a unique place in German literature. The spirit of the heroic epic pervades Daniel, in contrast to other courtly Arthurian romances: Daniel's prestige comes from his abilities as a fighter, rather than his exemplification of courtly ideals, the pre-courtly focus on the importance of vassal-monarch relations prevails throughout the story, and Arthur takes part in the hostilities, contrary to his depiction as <b>a</b> <b>roi</b> fainéant in other romances. Der Pleier's romance Garel was written as a reaction to Daniel; Der Pleier found Daniel too brutal and cunning to make a proper hero, and wrote his romance in the spirit of contemporary courtly attitudes. While Daniel's popularity faded, Garel continued to be admired, and as late as 1400 Runckelstein Castle near Bolzano in Italy was decorated with frescos of scenes from Garel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{region of}} {{interest}} (ROI) based {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) group analysis, errors in delineation of <b>an</b> <b>ROI</b> or inclusion of non-active voxels within <b>an</b> <b>ROI</b> can bias the statistical results. Addressing these concerns, this paper presents a new fMRI processing method that simultaneously refines ROI delineation and spatially denoises fMRI activation statistics within the ROI. The underlying assumption is that activation statistics within a small neighborhood are spatially correlated, thereby exhibit similar levels of influence on the overall ROI’s response. Based on this assumption, we first identify outlier voxels as those having undue influence on <b>an</b> <b>ROI’s</b> feature. Isolated outlier voxels at region boundaries are then removed, thereby refining the ROI delineation. The remaining outlier voxels are de-weighted based on their influence relative to their neighbors to reduce the effects of voxels deemed falsely active in later analysis. The proposed method was tested on real fMRI data collected from 8 healthy subjects performing a bulb-squeezing motor task at various frequencies. Using the proposed method, enhanced capability for detection of frequency-related activation map feature differences (AMFD) was demonstrated when compared to Gaussian spatial smoothing of ROI activation statistics. The validity of the proposed method is suggested by the fact that using one feature for denoising (e. g. spatial variance) results in greater effect size in another feature (e. g. average activation statistics magnitude). Our results demonstrate the importance of accurate ROI delineation in ROI-based fMRI analysis. O I...|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} cope with the above {{described}} problems in the care-providing robot FRIEND the special vision system ROVIS (RObust machine VIsion for Service robotics) [...] was developed. The structure of ROVIS is depicted in Fig. 5. There are two main ROVIS components: hardware and object recognition and reconstruction chain. The connection between ROVIS and the overall robot control system is represented by the World Model where ROVIS stores the processed visual information. At the initialization phase of ROVIS the extrinsic camera parameters needed for 3D object reconstruction and the transformation between stereo camera and manipulator which is necessary for vision based object manipulation are calculated by the Camera Calibration module. The object recognition and reconstruction chain consists of robust algorithms for object recognition and 3D reconstruction for the purpose of reliable manipulation motion planning and grasping in unstructured environments and variable illumination conditions. Therefore, an accuracy of 5mm for the estimated 3D pose is necessary which enforces very good and precise algorithms. In ROVIS, robustness must be understood as the capability to the system to adapt to varying operational conditions and is realized through the inclusion feedback mechanisms at the image processing level and also between different hardware and software components of the vision system. A core part of the system is the automatic, closed-loop calculation of an image Region of Interest (ROI) on which vision methods are applied. By using <b>a</b> <b>ROI</b> the performance of object recognition and 3D reconstruction can be improved since the scene complexity is reduced.|$|E
