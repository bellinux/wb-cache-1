5|$|Nearly {{all adult}} caddisflies are terrestrial, but their larvae and pupae are aquatic. They share this {{characteristic}} with several distantly-related groups, namely the dragonflies, mayflies, stoneflies, alderflies and lacewings. The ancestors {{of all these}} groups were terrestrial, with open tracheal systems, convergently evolving different types of gills for their aquatic larvae <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> to the water to avoid predation.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture is the {{dominant}} source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century. After {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1865, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{televised}} match, Edge and Chris Masters (representing Raw) faced Rey Mysterio and Matt Hardy (representing SmackDown!). Before the match, Edge refused to wrestle, saying he didn't care about representing Raw and chose Snitsky as his replacement. Masters and Snitsky quickly gained the early {{advantage in the}} match, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> the upper hand over Mysterio. Mysterio fought back with a tilt-a-whirl, a counterattack hold. Afterwards, Hardy and Snitsky were tagged in, leading to Hardy getting the advantage as he delivered a Side Effect and DDT on Snitsky. Back and forth action took place between both teams. The match ended when Mysterio performed the 619 on Masters, before Hardy performed the Twist of Fate on Snitsky. Mysterio pinned Masters to give SmackDown! the win over Raw.|$|E
5|$|Under the new charter, Philadelphians {{elected a}} seventeen-member city council in 1951, with ten members {{representing}} districts of the city, {{and the remaining}} seven being elected at-large.

5|$|After the {{disastrous}} losses of Operation Bodenplatte, {{and failing to}} maintain air superiority over the Ardennes area, a severely weakened II./JG 1 transferred to Insterburg in East Prussia (modern Chernyakhovsk in Russia). I./JG 1 faced British fighters over Hengelo-Twente on 14 January 1945. JG 1 lost 12 pilots with 7 being killed, 3 wounded and 2 missing. Spitfires shot down the entire 1. and 2. staffels of JG 1 at Twente airport <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> off (for the loss of two). Ihlefeld threatened to court martial Major G.

5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, McLeod joined the Canadian {{national}} team <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> part in an extended residency in order to prepare and train. McLeod and the Canadian national team started off the year at the Four Nations Tournament. While McLeod was on the roster for the tournament, she did not play in any of the three games, allowing fellow Canadian Stephanie Labbé to gain experience. McLeod made her first appearance of the year at the Cyprus Cup in March, where she appeared in three of the four matches that Canada played, recording three shutouts. She also appeared in two other friendlies against France and England in April and May. In April 2015, McLeod was named to the 23-player Canadian roster for the FIFA Women's World Cup hosted by Canada. As Canada's veteran goalkeeper, she started in net for all five of the team's matches, recording three shutouts, and helping Canada earn a sixth-place finish. The team's one loss came in the quarter-finals against England, which halted their advancement in the tournament. Although McLeod had an impressive tournament, she was left off both the Golden Glove shortlist and the FIFA Technical Study Group All-Star Squad.|$|E

Schyster) and The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu). The match began with the Steiners in control <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> turns attacking DiBiase. Fatu and Bart Gunn entered the match, and Fatu and his {{teammates}} wore Bart down while preventing him from tagging in a partner. Billy Gunn fought DiBiase and controlled the match until DiBiase performed the Million Dollar Dream on Billy. DiBiase released the hold and gloated about his performance. This enabled Billy Gunn to surprise DiBiase with a small package pinfall to win the match. After the match, the teams continued to fight until the Steiners and Gunns cleared their opponents from the ring.|$|E

5|$|Little {{published}} {{their next}} two books in April and June 2003. The first, Speed, had Clark fighting hate crimes in Smallville. The second, Buried Secrets, followed Clark and Lex as they both {{fell in love}} with a mind-reading, substitute Spanish teacher. In the novel, Clark and Lex's friendship was put in jeopardy as the two competed for the teacher's love. On September 9, 2004, Aspect published Shadows, where Clark must stop a girl's scientist father, who has created a monster that is killing people. Runaway featured Clark leaving Smallville and living on the streets of Metropolis with other homeless teenagers. Clark {{fell in love with}} one of the girls before eventually returning home. Smallville: Silence has Clark and his friends investigating the appearance of zombies. Little's Greed followed Clark and his friends <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> jobs as summer counselors to disadvantaged youths. Pete tried to abuse Clark's abilities by tricking him into playing in a basketball game, and then betting on the outcome.|$|E
5|$|Pre-season for Plymouth Argyle {{began on}} 1 July 2009 {{when the first}} team squad {{returned}} to Harpers Park. A week of intense training followed, before the club's first match of the new season took place on 13 July 2009 against Cornish side Truro City. In a match which featured trialist Kári Árnason, Argyle scored a goal in each half to earn a comfortable win. A youthful Argyle team headed across the city of Plymouth {{the next day to}} take on Plymouth Parkway. The visitors fell behind to an early goal but responded with three of their own in an entertaining friendly, including a brace from Republic of Ireland youth international Joe Mason. The first team were in action again the next day, against Torquay United. The visitors went behind twice but looked like leaving Plainmoor with a win until Torquay converted a penalty in the 90th minute. The squad then departed for a tour of Scotland, and stopped off in the north of England on the way in order to play a friendly against Skelmersdale United on 18 July 2009. Argyle came away with a 2–0 win after scoring a goal in each half. A picturesque setting greeted the squad <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> to the field against Livingston on 20 July 2009. An 81st-minute penalty from Luke Summerfield wasn't enough to save Argyle from their first defeat of the season.|$|E
5|$|The Germans quickly {{developed}} {{a series of}} basic tactics for intercepting enemy intruders. The lack of airborne radar {{at this stage in}} the war meant finding and destroying Allied bombers at night was a difficult prospect, thus it was decided to use the Fernnachtjagd in operations over Britain. Major Kuhlmann, head of the wireless telegraphy interception service played a significant part in assisting the Luftwaffe night fighter force as did Wolfgang Martini's Luftnachrichtentruppe (Air Signal Corps). Intercepting British signal communications by monitoring the radio traffic of enemy ground stations and aircraft the Germans could determine where and at what airfields RAF night activity was occurring. With the British base identified Falck could then move against them over their own airfields. Three waves could then be deployed; one to attack the bombers <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> off, one to cover the known routes taken by the enemy over the North Sea, and the third to attack them on landing at a time when, after a long flight, enemy crews were tired and much less alert. For operational purposes, Eastern England was divided into four regions or Räume (areas). Raum A was Yorkshire, bounded by Hull, Leeds, Lancaster and Newcastle. Raum B covered the Midlands and Lincolnshire whilst Raum C encompassed East Anglia bounded by London Peterborough, Luton and The Wash. Operations began in earnest in October 1940.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of material created for previous games, {{such as the}} BLiTZ system and the design of maps, was carried over. Alongside this, improvements {{were made to the}} game's graphics and some elements were expanded, such as map layouts, mission structure, and the number of playable units per mission. A part of this upgrade involved creating unique polygon models for each character's body. In order to achieve this, the cooperative elements incorporated into the second game were removed, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> up a large portion of memory space needed for the improvements. They also adjusted the difficulty settings and ease of play so they could appeal to new players while retaining the essential components of the series' gameplay. The newer systems were decided upon early in development. The character designs were done by Raita Honjou, who had worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games. When creating the Nameless Squad, Honjou was faced with the same problem he had had during the first game: the military uniforms essentially destroyed character individuality, despite him needing to create unique characters the player could identify while maintaining a sense of reality within the Valkyria Chronicles world. The main color of the Nameless was black. As with the previous Valkyria games, Valkyria Chronicles III used the CANVAS graphics engine. The anime opening was produced by Production I.G.|$|E
