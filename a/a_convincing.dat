5|$|H3 and H6 do {{not share}} such <b>a</b> <b>convincing</b> suite of Heinrich event {{symptoms}} as events H1, H2, H4, and H5, which has led some researchers {{to suggest that they}} are not true Heinrich events. That would make Gerard C. Bond's suggestion of Heinrich events fitting into a 7,000-year cycle ("Bond events") suspect.|$|E
5|$|Ross and Emily's {{marriage}} was originally planned to last, but Helen Baxendale {{did not wish}} to remain in America while pregnant. The writers could not script <b>a</b> <b>convincing</b> story for why Emily would not be seen, despite being married to Ross, so Baxendale was written out in the next season, making only three cameo appearances after the season premiere.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>a</b> <b>convincing</b> {{victory at}} Killiecrankie, his army took heavy losses and Dundee himself was killed. Without his {{leadership}} and divided by a quarrel between the leaders {{that led to}} a significant segment of the survivors leaving, the remaining Jacobite force was defeated in August at the Battle of Dunkeld, by a newly raised government regiment of Cameronians. The last remnants surrendered after the Battle of Cromdale in Strathspey on 1 May 1690, ending this phase of Jacobite resistance in Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Even {{after the}} declaration, {{there was still}} {{substantial}} support for James in Scotland. Viscount Dundee raised an army in the Scottish Highlands and won <b>a</b> <b>convincing</b> victory at Killiecrankie on 27 July. The huge losses suffered by Dundee's troops, however, coupled with his fatal wounding {{at the start of}} the battle, served to remove the only effective resistance to William and the uprising was quickly crushed, suffering a resounding defeat the next month at the Battle of Dunkeld.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party {{recognized}} the element's discovery and assigned the {{priority to the}} Dubna-Livermore collaboration of 2009–2010, giving {{them the right to}} suggest a permanent name for it. While they did not recognise the experiments synthesising 287Mc and 288Mc as persuasive {{due to the lack of}} <b>a</b> <b>convincing</b> identification of atomic number via cross-reactions, they recognised the 293Ts experiments as persuasive because its daughter 289Mc had been produced independently and found to exhibit the same properties.|$|E
5|$|In January, Lee won {{his seventh}} Malaysia Open title by {{defeating}} Taufik Hidayat from Indonesia in the final. However, {{he failed to}} defend the Korea Open title, the world's first ever million-dollar badminton tournament, after being beaten by Lin Dan from China in three games. In March, Lee cruised into {{the final of the}} All England Open for the third consecutive time and retained his title successfully with <b>a</b> <b>convincing</b> straight games victory over Lin Dan, and was praised by prime minister Najib Tun Razak.|$|E

40|$|In many situations, the {{dependence}} of the production or utility on the corresponding factors is described by the CES (Constant Elasticity of Substitution) functions. These functions are usually explained by postulating two requirements: an economically reasonable postulate of homogeneity (that the formulas should not change if we change a measuring unit) and <b>a</b> less <b>convincing</b> CSE requirement. In this paper, we show that the CES requirement can be replaced by <b>a</b> more <b>convincing</b> requirement [...] that the combined effect of all the factors should {{not depend on the}} order in which we combine these factors...|$|R

5|$|In {{the return}} match against Queensland, Harvey made 17 as Victoria took <b>a</b> <b>convincing</b> innings win. In the next match against New South Wales, Harvey played with Neil {{for the first}} time at {{first-class}} level, and pair played together for their state’s two remaining matches of the season, although they never batted together as Merv was always out before Neil came in, usually at No. 6. Merv made 30 and 44, failing to capitalise on his starts to make a big score with a Test vacancy beckoning; incumbent opener Sid Barnes was injured and unavailable for the Fourth Test.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{regard the}} badnjak customs as practises {{inherited}} from the old Slavic religion. In the pre-Christian religion of the Serbs, as shown by Serbian scholar Veselin Čajkanović, there were trees seen as dwelling places of spirits or divinities. Čajkanović argues that there were also trees seen as divinities per se. He considers the badnjak as <b>a</b> <b>convincing</b> example of the latter. Salutations, prayers, and sacrifices such as grain, wine, and honey are offered to him (the name badnjak is of masculine gender in Serbian); he is consistently treated not as a tree but as a person.|$|E
5|$|The biographer Eugen Segnitz {{noted in}} 1922 {{that the work}} of intense {{expression}} was singular in the sacred music of its period, with <b>a</b> <b>convincing</b> musical interpretation of the biblical text and its manifold shades of emotion. Paul Hindemith wrote a trimmed adaption which probably helped to keep the work in the repertory, and François Callebout wrote an organ version, making the work accessible for smaller choirs. It was first performed in Wiesbaden, where the composer studied, in 2003. The celebration of the Reger Year 2016 led to several performances.|$|E
5000|$|Preston Brust and Chris Lucas of {{the country}} duo LoCash wrote the song with Jaren Johnston. According to Brust, a Sony/ATV Music Publishing {{representative}} suggested that he and Lucas write with Johnston. Johnston suggested a lyric about a [...] "Blackbird on a country street / Hiding from {{the world with a}} broken wing [...] ", and wrote a song about <b>a</b> man <b>convincing</b> <b>a</b> woman if she [...] "gonna fly with him".|$|R

5|$|The biographer Eugen Segnitz {{wrote in}} 1922 {{that the work}} was not only {{singular}} in the composer's work, but in the sacred music of its period, with a rare intense power of expression ("intensive Ausdruckskraft") and <b>a</b> <b>convincing</b> musical exegesis of the biblical text and also its turns and manifold shades of emotion ("überzeugende musikalische Auslegung des biblischen Textes, wie auch seiner Wendungen und mannigfaltigen Gefühlsschattierungen").|$|E
5|$|The {{blood that}} spurts {{out of the}} Klingon's wounds was created using {{computer}} generated imagery; the animators {{had to make sure}} that the blood floated in <b>a</b> <b>convincing</b> manner while still looking interesting and not too gory. The effects artist looked at NASA footage of floating globules of water to inform the physics of the blood particles. Initially, the blood was to be colored green, but the filmmakers realized that McCoy had referred to Spock as green-blooded.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} by Jeremy P. Tarcher Inc. as a hardcover in January 2010. It was noted as being well-researched and covering a significant breadth of academic fields. However, reviews were mixed; several reviewers found that while Rifkin provided <b>a</b> <b>convincing</b> overview {{of the development of}} empathy, he did not provide sufficient proof that increased empathy would necessarily bring people together to co-operatively solve global problems.|$|E

5|$|When Seungsahn {{first began}} {{teaching}} in the United States, there was an underemphasis in his message on the significance of zazen. Under advice from some students, however, he soon came to incorporate zazen into the curriculum more frequently. More than {{a few of his}} earliest students had practiced Zen previously under the Sōtō priest Shunryū Suzuki, laying out <b>a</b> <b>convincing</b> argument about how zazen and Zen were seen as inseparable in the Western psyche.|$|E
5|$|Alex Weldon {{was hired}} to be {{supervisor}} of special effects for the film. Weldon was planning on retiring after 42years of effects work, but his wife urged him to take on Star Trek because she thought {{he did not have}} enough to do. When Weldon was hired, many of the effects had already been started or completed by Rugg; it was up to Weldon to complete more complex and higher-budgeted effects for the motion picture. The first step of preparation involved analyzing the script in the number, duration, and type of effects. Before costs could be determined and Weldon could shop for necessary items, he and {{the other members of the}} special effects team worked out all possibilities for pulling off the effects in <b>a</b> <b>convincing</b> manner.|$|E
5|$|At the Tour de Luxembourg in June, Rast {{entered as}} {{defending}} champion {{and was considered}} among the favorites, but the team did not win any stage or finish on the podium. Leipheimer won the prologue time trial to the Dauphine Libéré later in the month, and wound up finishing third overall in the race. Klöden next took second overall in the Tour de Suisse, later in June. The following month, Leipheiemer and Horner raced as Astana (though {{they were the only}} Astana riders in the event) at the Cascade Cycling Classic, and Leipheimer was able to take the overall win there, largely thanks to <b>a</b> <b>convincing</b> victory in the third stage time trial. On the same day, René Haselbacher won a stage in Tour of Austria. Later in the month, Sergeui Ivanov won the Tour de Wallonie, without winning a stage.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the year, Robson had reached the top 50 {{for the first time in}} her career. She {{followed}} this with her first victory at the Australian Open with <b>a</b> <b>convincing</b> straight sets victory over Melanie Oudin. In the second round she played former Wimbledon champion, and fellow left-hander, Petra Kvitová. Robson came back after losing the first set to beat Kvitová in a three-hour match, to set up a third-round meeting with Sloane Stephens. After stopping for several shoulder treatments, Robson was eventually beaten in two sets. After the Australian Open, Robson played six matches in Fed Cup competition that saw Great Britain earn a World Group II Play-off spot against Argentina. Following this success she went on to lose two successive matches, losing to Daniela Hantuchová in Doha and to wildcard Yulia Putintseva in Dubai.|$|E
5|$|Carr Gomm {{contacted}} {{other institutions}} and hospitals {{more suited to}} caring for chronic cases, but none would accept Merrick. Gomm {{wrote a letter to}} The Times, printed on 4 December, outlining Merrick's case and asking readers for suggestions. The public response—in letters and donations—was significant, and the situation was even covered by the British Medical Journal. With the financial backing of the many donors, Gomm was able to make <b>a</b> <b>convincing</b> case to the committee for keeping Merrick in the hospital. It was decided that he would be allowed to stay there for the remainder of his life. He was moved from the attic to two rooms in the basement adjacent to a small courtyard. The rooms were adapted and furnished to suit Merrick, with a specially constructed bed and—at Treves's instruction—no mirrors.|$|E

It is later revealed that the induction under Cosades, and the player's release from prison, {{was due to the}} Emperor's suspicion that the player might be the Nerevarine – a reincarnation of the legendary Dunmer hero Indoril Nerevar – or at least someone would make <b>a</b> <b>convincing</b> imposter to use for political gain. The PC is tasked with uncovering the prophecies regarding the Nerevarine, and to fulfil them in order to finally defeat Dagoth Ur and his Sixth House cult.|$|E
