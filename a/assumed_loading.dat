An approximate but extremely simple relationship is derived among the operating stress level, the length of crack, {{and the number of}} cycles of failure. Any one of the variables can be computed approximately from the knowledge of the other two, if the loading schedule (mission of the tank) is not greatly altered.

This was a preliminary study regarding an attempt to model an EBM component to validate the physical tests.

40|$|Buckling {{strength}} predictions {{are presented}} {{for a wide}} range of thin isotropic skew plates. The key studied parameters include the aspect ratio, skew angle, and rotational restraint stiffness on the different edges of the plate. The buckling strengths are evaluated both for isolated plates and for plates that are continuous with other parts of the structure. The <b>assumed</b> <b>loading</b> is uniform, uniaxial compression. The buckling predictions are presented in the form of dimensionless buckling curves, which permit a ready adoption into the “data sheets” commonly used in current design. The buckling predictions demonstrate the effect of introducing symmetrical combinations of elastic restraints against rotation on the edges of isolated skew plates. Further, they are presented in a manner that allows the benefits of continuity over skew bays to be evaluated. The curves also illustrate the complex character of the buckling mode changes that take place with a change in aspect ratio in skew plate structures. In addition, these mode changes lead to well defined local optima, which the designer can exploit if he has control over the aspect ratio of a skew plate...|$|E

Most credible energy scenarios for the UK based on the earlier CO 2 emissions reduction targets of 60 % compared to 1990 levels strategically allocated all emissions savings to other sectors of the UK economy, allowing the majority of road transport to be powered by fossil fuels. The revision of the emission reduction targets to 80 % means that {{this is no longer}} an option and we now need radical changes in the way we power and use transport. Any likely future UK energy system will almost certainly involve the electrification of a significant proportion of the transport system.

At peak loads, these systems {{are susceptible to}} large volumes of transactions and concurrent users and yet {{they are expected to}} maintain adequate performance levels. Over provisioning is an expensive solution. A good alternative is the adaptation of the system, managing and controlling its resources. We address these concerns by presenting a model that allows fast evaluation of performance metrics in terms of measurable or controllable parameters. The model can be used in order to (a) predict the performance of a system under given or <b>assumed</b> <b>loading</b> conditions and (b) to choose the optimal configuration set-up for certain controllable parameters with respect to specified performance measures.

The conceptual {{design of a}} new propylene/propane separation process (300 kton/yr at 99. 9 wt % propene purity) {{by means of a}} gas/liquid membrane contactor and a selective silver salt solution is presented. It involves the selection of an absorption liquid (AgBF 4), its concentration (5. 5 M, <b>assumed</b> <b>loading</b> of 90 %), and the operating conditions of the membrane contactor and the desorber. Subsequently, modeling of the gas/liquid membrane contactor is carried out. The calculated membrane area required for the process is approximately 80 000 m 2. The influence of the assumptions made during the conceptual design and modeling stage is evaluated with a sensitivity analysis. Finally, a preliminary design is presented, resulting in a process flow sheet with equipment sized on standard design criteria. A brief economic evaluation shows that the marginal difference between the feed and product prices should be at least 175 $/ton to make the proposed propylene/propane separation process economically feasible...|$|E
40|$|The current article {{proposes a}} {{procedure}} for calculating deflections in buildings with EC 2 and evaluates the span-to-effective-depth rules in EC 2 and BS 8110. Guidance is given on {{the calculation of}} deflection with EC 2 and updated recommendations are made for including the effect of construction loading in long-term deflection calculations. It is shown that deflections in slabs {{are very sensitive to}} the <b>assumed</b> <b>loading,</b> boundary conditions and concrete tensile strength if the maximum span moment is close to the cracking moment. The theoretical background to span to depth rules is discussed along with the assumptions made in the derivation of the EC 2 span to depth rules. It is shown that the EC 2 span-to-depth rules can lead to significant reductions in slab thickness compared with BS 8110 since the rules account for the beneficial influence of the concrete tensile strength on deflection. It is also shown that the span to depth rules in EC 2 overestimate the reduction in slab thickness which can be obtained by providing surplus reinforcement to equate the actual and permissible span to depth ratios. An amendment is proposed to improve the accuracy of the EC 2 span to depth rules. ...|$|E

40|$|Nondimensional stress {{intensity}} factor (K) solutions for continuous circumferential cracks in threaded fasteners were calculated using finite element methods that determined the energy release rate during virtual crack extension. <b>Assumed</b> <b>loading</b> conditions included both remote tension and nut loading, whereby the effects of applying the load to the thread flank were considered. In addition, K solutions were developed for axisymmetric surface cracks in notched and smooth round bars. Results showed that the stress concentration of a thread causes a considerable increase in K for shallow cracks, but has much less effect for longer cracks. In the latter case, values of K can be accurately estimated from K solutions for axisymmetric cracks in smooth round bars. Nut loading increased K by about 50 % for shallow cracks, but this effect became negligible at crack depth-to-minor diameter ratios (a/d) greater than 0. 2. An evaluation of thread root acuity effects showed that root radius {{has no effect on}} K when the crack depth exceeds 2 % of the minor diameter. Closed-form K solutions were developed for both remote-loading and nut-loading conditions and {{for a wide range of}} thread root radii.

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT REQUEST OF AUTHOR. ] This {{research}} {{explores the}} application of ultrasonic stress measurement (USM) technologies to assess stress levels in gusset plates {{with the development of}} a small portable tool for in-situ condition assessment. The I- 35 W bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota collapsed {{as a result of an}} overstressed (under-designed) gusset plate. Currently, the analytical tools used to assess the adequacy of gusset plates depend on <b>assumed</b> <b>loading</b> based on the intended design configuration of the bridge and conventional tools such as strain gages. The research team has previously developed a methodology for ultrasonic stress measurements in steel plates. This technology utilizes acoustic birefringence to analyze principal stresses. The birefringence measurement evaluates the normalized velocity difference of orthogonally polarized shear waves propagating through the plate. The birefringence varies proportionally as a function of strain in the steel. For verification, laboratory and field test were undertaken to compare ultrasonic stress measurements with stress measurements obtain via conventional strain gages.

40|$|A {{topology}} optimization program {{was applied to}} test the hypothesis that bone adaptation to porous coated implants produces a structure which minimizes the global strain energy density. The program was used to predict the optimal material layout around a porous coated tibial component with multiple cones [Goldstein et al., Trans. 37 th ORS, p. 92 (1991) ]. The sensitivity of the predicted adaptation to analysis assumptions was assessed and the predicted bone ingrowth and apposition were compared with the experimental findings of Goldstein et al. The results showed that apposition occurred consistently at the cone tips regardless of analysis assumptions. The specific topology of apposition at the cone tips was most sensitive to the <b>assumed</b> <b>loading</b> conditions. A comparison with the experimental results for 11 subdivisions showed that the general predicted location of material agreed with the experimental results (R 2 >= 0. 59). However, the program predicted a consolidated bone greater than 1000 [mu]m in thickness at the cone tips, which differed from the porous bone structure found experimentally. This discrepancy was reflected in a refined comparison over 31 subdivisions which did not produce a significant correlation (R 2 <= 0. 3). The program also predicted little ingrowth (< 6 - 7 %), indicating that ingrowth past the first bead layer contributed little to the overall bone-implant interface layer stiffness. Based on these results, we conclude, within limitations of a two-dimensional analysis, that bone adaptation to porous coated implants does not produce a structure solely optimized to minimize the global strain energy density. We hypothesize that the final bone structure reflects the need to meet both mechanical and nutritional demands...|$|E

40|$|The seismic {{response}} {{analysis of}} such liquid storage systems, especially liquid metal reactors, as {{for example the}} eXperimental Accelerator Driven System (XADS), was examined taking into account mainly the coupling effects of the fluid-structure interaction and their influence on its relevant internal systems and components. Therefore this paper deals with the structural analyses of the seismically induced hydrodynamic responses, {{in the event of}} a safe shutdown earthquake (SSE), and the free oscillation (known as sloshing waves) of a metal liquid coolant as well as the dynamic buckling effects on involved structures. To the mentioned purpose the interaction and coupling effects among the main reactor vessel structures and the primary coolant response were investigated by means of a numerical evaluation (with a qualified finite element code) because of the lack of analytical linear theories that in any case are not adequate to describe all the complex phenomena related to the seismic loading. For the numerical modelling procedure, 3 D finite element models were set up to analyse the propagation of seismic waves as well as its derived structural effects, such as the fluid steep waves motion, the local buckling bulges, etc., taking into account the geometrical and material nonlinearities of the RPV and the considered simplified internals. The obtained numerical results in terms of stress intensity and of the capability of the structures to resist relevant seismic loads are, thus, presented and discussed.

30|$|Instead {{of judging}} the {{calibration}} through only differences and/or ratios {{of the observed}} to the predicted pressure or head loss differences between the test nodes and nearby boundary locations (reservoirs/tanks) having known pressures or heads (Walski 1986), it is preferable to judge the calibration through minimizing the summation of the sum of square of difference between the measured and simulated value of pressure heads at test nodes as done {{in most of the}} implicit approaches The Research Committee on Water Distribution Systems of the American Water Works Association (1974) states that “the major source of error in simulation of contemporary performance will be in the assumed loadings distribution and their variations”. On the other hand, Eggener and Polkowski (1976) state that the weakest piece of input information is not the <b>assumed</b> <b>loading</b> condition, but the pipe friction factor. From these conflicting views, it is clear that, in some cases, the adjustment in the pipe head-loss coefficients may be more predominant than the adjustment in the nodal consumptions, while the opposite may be the situation in other cases (Shamir and Howard 1977). Walski (1986) suggested consideration of multiple demand loadings for reliable model calibration, which can be generated through pump on/off conditions or excessive withdrawal at one or few nodes by opening fire hydrants. The novelty of the study herein is the use of online data of flow and pressures that provided a set of observations under various loadings. This paper demonstrates that with the online pressure and flow data at few observational points in the network, it is possible to accurately calibrate a model of a real WDN by adjusting the pipe roughness coefficients only. This is achieved by providing accurate inputs about pipe lengths, diameters and materials, nodal elevations, nodal demands, valve status and its opening. The importance of the valve is recognized, as these are used for isolation as well as pressure and flow control purpose by throttling. The usual way of considering head loss through them as minor loss and clubbing their effects in adjusting pipe roughness coefficient results in a very absurd value of pipe roughness coefficients.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a control strategy for the supercritical CO{sub 2 } (S-CO{sub 2 }) Brayton cycle has been extended to the investigation of alternate control strategies for a Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) nuclear power plant incorporating a S-CO{sub 2 } Brayton cycle power converter. The SFR assumed is the 400 MWe (1000 MWt) ABR- 1000 preconceptual design incorporating metallic fuel. Three alternative idealized schemes for controlling the reactor side of the plant {{in combination with the}} existing automatic control strategy for the S-CO{sub 2 } Brayton cycle are explored using the ANL Plant Dynamics Code together with the SAS 4 A/SASSYS- 1 Liquid Metal Reactor (LMR) Analysis Code System coupled together using the iterative coupling formulation previously developed and implemented into the Plant Dynamics Code. The first option assumes that the reactor side can be ideally controlled through movement of control rods and changing the speeds of both the primary and intermediate coolant system sodium pumps such that the intermediate sodium flow rate and inlet temperature to the sodium-to-CO{sub 2 } heat exchanger (RHX) remain unvarying while the intermediate sodium outlet temperature changes as the load demand from the electric grid changes and the S-CO{sub 2 } cycle conditions adjust according to the S-CO{sub 2 } cycle control strategy. For this option, the reactor plant follows an <b>assumed</b> change in <b>load</b> demand from 100 to 0 % nominal at 5 % reduction per minute in a suitable fashion. The second option allows the reactor core power and primary and intermediate coolant system sodium pump flow rates to change autonomously in response to the strong reactivity feedbacks of the metallic fueled core and assumed constant pump torques representing unchanging output from the pump electric motors. The plant behavior to the <b>assumed</b> <b>load</b> demand reduction is surprising close to that calculated for the first option. The only negative result observed is a slight increase in the intermediate inlet sodium temperatures by about 10 C. This temperature rise could presumably be precluded or significantly reduced through fine adjustment of the control rods and pump motors. The third option assumes that the reactor core power and primary and intermediate system flow rates are ideally reduced linearly in a programmed fashion that instantaneously matches the prescribed load demand. The calculated behavior of this idealized case reveals a number of difficulties because the control strategy for the S-CO{sub 2 } cycle overcools the reactor potentially resulting in the calculation of sodium bulk freezing and the onset of sodium boiling. The results show that autonomous SFR operation may be viable for the particular <b>assumed</b> <b>load</b> change transient and deserves further investigation for other transients and postulated accidents...|$|R
