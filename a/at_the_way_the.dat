25|$|There {{are several}} {{approaches}} to this issue. One {{approach is to}} argue that all real forces drop off with distance from their sources in a known manner, so we have only {{to be sure that}} a body is far enough away from all sources to ensure that no force is present. A possible issue with this approach is the historically long-lived view that the distant universe might affect matters (Mach's principle). Another approach is to identify all real sources for real forces and account for them. A possible issue with this approach is that we might miss something, or account inappropriately for their influence, perhaps, again, due to Mach's principle and an incomplete understanding of the universe. A third approach is to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> forces transform when we shift reference frames. Fictitious forces, those that arise due to the acceleration of a frame, disappear in inertial frames, and have complicated rules of transformation in general cases. On the basis of universality of physical law and the request for frames where the laws are most simply expressed, inertial frames are distinguished by the absence of such fictitious forces.|$|E

However, this causes friction with her son-in-law. Following a fall, Susan loses the baby. Woodburne called the scenes [...] "difficult" [...] to film. Alan Fletcher said the storyline [...] "could have been dreadful in the wrong hands", but he was pleased <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> scenes were handled. He added [...] "The notion of a mother being a surrogate for their daughter is something you can't pretend is not controversial. The writers embraced that and showed how Susan's decision divided the community, and has potential to divide the family". Neighbours timeslot presented difficulties for the storyline. The writers were forced to tone the plot down to comply with guidelines. Woodburne said [...] "Because {{of the time of}} day that our show is on—it's on at 6.30 here and day time in the UK—obviously doing something as controversial as surrogacy at that time slot we would be so restricted by censorship". The storyline received mixed reactions from viewers. Woodburne said that people believe Susan is [...] "such a good mother and it's awesome she's prepared to do this for Libby and Dan". Other viewers have said that Susan should not have got involved and that the storyline was ridiculous as Susan is too old. Neighbours executive producer Susan Bower also spoke out about the storyline and said [...] "I've had quite a few letters from people in England who'd heard about it before it was even in the papers in Australia saying they disagree and think it's shocking".|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} Helen Fielding’s, Marlene Streeruwitz’s, and Karen Duve’s novels {{in the context}} of the literarisches Fräuleinwunder, the generic conventions of chick lit, and postfeminism, relating all three to the globalization of the book publishing industry and its effects on German-language fiction. I argue that Duve’s and Streeruwitz’s texts can be understood as responses to the Anglo-American chick lit that flooded the German-language book market in the 1990 s, of which Fielding’s novel is one of the best-known. Close readings situate both German-language novels firmly within the generic conventions of chick lit, and then look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> texts relate to postfeminism, as well as second- and third-wave feminism.

40|$|This project explores <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> that non-European ???strangers??? were reimagined and reframed {{in early}} modem England through the exotic retelling of their stories {{and those of}} the explorers and {{travelers}} who ???discovered??? them.

My examination of this process of imagining the ???other??? focuses primarily on two seventeenth-century works, Othello and Oroonoko, and looks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> effects of contact are rehearsed through them. Furthermore, because refashioning the ???other??? was a necessary part of the construction of the English ???self??? during the nascent stages of nationalism, I suggest that these contact narratives are as concerned with understanding the identity of the self as with the other, ultimately demonstrating an anxiety over the fluidity of identity in hybridized spaces...|$|R
