5|$|When East Anglia {{was first}} {{mentioned}} by Bede in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, {{it was a}} powerful kingdom ruled by Rædwald (died about 624). According to Bede, Rædwald was recognised as exercising dominance or imperium over the southern Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, a position that was assured when he gave his loyalty <b>and</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> Edwin of Northumbria (who {{was at that time}} a fugitive at the East Anglian court) and when together they defeated Æthelfrith of Northumbria {{on the banks of the}} River Idle, a tributary of the Trent.

5|$|While {{policies}} {{were brought in}} to improve the living conditions of the working classes, conversely many middle-class Bolivians {{felt that they had}} seen their social standing decline, with Morales personally mistrusting the middle-classes, deeming them fickle. A 2006 law reallocated state-owned lands, with this agrarian reform entailing distributing land to traditional communities rather than individuals. In 2010, a law was introduced permitting the formation of recognised indigenous territories, although the implementation of this was hampered by bureaucracy and contesting claims over ownership. Morales' regime also sought to improve women's rights in Bolivia. In 2010, it founded a Unit of Depatriarchalization to oversee this process. Further seeking to provide legal recognition <b>and</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> LGBT rights, it declared June 28 to be Sexual Minority Rights Day in the country, and encouraged the establishment of a gay-themed television show on the state channel.|$|E
5|$|During late 1596, Michael {{was faced}} with an {{unexpected}} attack from the Tatars, who had destroyed the towns of Bucharest and Buzău. By the time Michael gathered his army to counterattack, the Tatars had speedily retreated and so no battle was fought. Michael was determined to continue {{the war against the}} Ottomans, but he was prevented because he lacked support from Sigismund Báthory and Rudolf II. On 7 January 1597 Hasan Pasha declared the independence of Wallachia under Michael's rule, but Michael knew that this was only an attempt to divert him from preparing for another future attack. Michael again requested Rudolf II's support and Rudolf finally agreed to send financial assistance to the Wallachian ruler. On 9 June 1598 a formal treaty was reached between Michael and Rudolf II. According to the treaty, the Austrian ruler would give Wallachia sufficient money to maintain a 5,000-man army, as well as armaments and supplies. Shortly after the treaty was signed, the war with the Ottomans resumed and Michael besieged Nicopolis on 10 September 1598 and took control of Vidin. The war with the Ottomans continued until 26 June 1599, when Michael, lacking the resources <b>and</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> continue prosecuting the war, signed a peace treaty.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Paul Allen pledged {{at least}} $100million toward {{the fight to}} end the Ebola virus {{epidemic}} in West Africa, making him the largest private donor in the Ebola crisis.

The site additionally highlights organizations working to stop Ebola that Allen supports such as International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, Médecins Sans Frontières, Partners in Health, UNICEF and World Food Program USA. On April 21, 2015, Allen brought together key leaders in the Ebola fight at the Ebola Innovation Summit in San Francisco. The summit aimed to share key learnings and reinforce the need for continued action <b>and</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> bring the number of Ebola cases down to zero. As part of his ongoing commitment to end the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the Paul Allen Foundation partnered with the United States Department of State and MRIGlobal to develop a new first of its kind medevac biocontainment units.

5|$|Stay-at-home dads {{make up a}} {{very small}} portion of the Australian {{population}} although this appears to be rapidly changing. In 2003, 91% of fathers with children aged under 15 years were employed with 85% employed full-time. Because of this, there are few role models or resources that can help Australian fathers with the stay-at-home dad role. The Australian Bureau of Statistics show that approximately 7% of two parents families with {{children under the age of}} 14 have a father who is unemployed and a mother who works full-time. Stay at home dads in Australia have almost doubled over the past decade from 57,900 to 106,000, and expected to increase in the future. Recent sociological studies have shown that men are dedicating more time <b>and</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> their children in comparison to the 19th century. The idea of a stay at home dad were far from mainstream, however the rising demand for female work has influenced this statistic to rise.|$|E
5|$|The brigade was {{organized}} as a training brigade preparing Army Reserve and Army National Guard units for deployment. The brigade prepares other units for mobilization and provides training, assistance, <b>and</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> them during pre-deployment exercises, and evaluates performance and progress of these units {{as they are}} deploying. Since its reactivation, the brigade has specialized in training provincial reconstruction teams (PRTs) deploying to Afghanistan. In early 2007, the 189th Infantry Brigade, along with the 158th Infantry Brigade, cooperated to train the first 12 PRTs at once at Fort Bragg for three-month training exercises. PRT personnel were trained {{in a wide range}} of scenarios, ranging from hospital repairs to childbirth scenarios and language labs.Afterwards, they conducted a conference on the training, in which it was decided that cultural awareness and language training needed to be stressed for future PRTs. It was during this training that the brigade finally received its distinctive unit insignia and shoulder sleeve insignia on 25 May 2008. In early 2008, the Brigade began training another group of 12 PRTs. Several months later, the Brigades began training the next 12 PRTs for a 270-day deployment to Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} began purchasing church run boarding {{schools in the}} 1920s. During this period capital {{costs associated with the}} schools were assumed by the government, leaving administrative and instructional duties to church officials. The hope was that minimizing facility expenditures would allow church administrators to provide higher quality instruction <b>and</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> the students in their care. Although the government was willing to, and did, purchase schools from the churches, many were acquired for free given that the rampant disrepair present in the buildings resulted in their having no economic value. Schools continued to be maintained by churches in instances where they failed to reach an agreement with government officials with the understanding that the government would provide support for capital costs. The understanding ultimately proved complicated {{due to the lack of}} written agreements outlining the extent and nature of that support or the approvals required to undertake expensive renovations and repairs.|$|E
