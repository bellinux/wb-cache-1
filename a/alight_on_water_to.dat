50|$|A communally {{roosting}} species, {{the passenger}} pigeon chose roosting sites {{that could provide}} shelter and enough food to sustain their large numbers for an indefinite period. The time spent at one roosting site may have depended {{on the extent of}} human persecution, weather conditions, or other, unknown factors. Roosts ranged in size and extent, from a few acres to 260 km2 or greater. Some roosting areas would be reused for subsequent years, others would only be used once. The passenger pigeon roosted in such numbers that even thick branches on a tree would break under the strain. The birds frequently piled on top of each other's backs to roost. They rested in a slumped position that hid their feet. They slept with their bills concealed by the feathers {{in the middle of the}} breast while holding their tail at a 45-degree angle. Dung could accumulate under a roosting site to a depth of over 0.3 m.If the pigeon became alert, it would often stretch out its head and neck in line with its body and tail, then nod its head in a circular pattern. When aggravated by another pigeon, it raised it wings threateningly, but passenger pigeons almost never actually fought. The pigeon bathed in shallow water, and afterwards lay on each side in turn and raised the opposite wing to dry it. The passenger pigeon drank at least once a day, typically at dawn, by fully inserting its bill into lakes, small ponds, and streams. Pigeons were seen perching on top of each other <b>to</b> access <b>water,</b> and if necessary, the species could <b>alight</b> <b>on</b> open <b>water</b> <b>to</b> drink. One of the primary causes of natural mortality was the weather, and every spring many individuals froze to death after migrating north too early. In captivity, a passenger pigeon was capable of living at least 15 years; Martha, the last known living passenger pigeon, was at least 17 and possibly as old as 29 when she died. It is undocumented how long a wild pigeon lived.|$|R

50|$|Seaplanes, flying boats, and amphibious {{aircraft}} {{are designed to}} take off and <b>alight</b> <b>on</b> <b>water.</b> <b>Alighting</b> can be supported by a hull-shaped fuselage and/or pontoons. The availability of a long effective runway was historically important on lifting size restrictions on aircraft, and their freedom from constructed strips remains useful for transportation to lakes and other remote areas. The ability <b>to</b> loiter <b>on</b> <b>water</b> is also important for marine rescue operations and fire fighting. One disadvantage of water alighting {{is that it is}} dangerous in the presence of waves. Furthermore, the necessary equipment compromises the craft's aerodynamic efficiency and speed.|$|R
50|$|A {{seaplane}} is a powered {{fixed-wing aircraft}} {{capable of taking}} off and landing (<b>alighting)</b> <b>on</b> <b>water.</b> Seaplanes that can also take off and land on airfields are in a subclass called amphibious aircraft. Seaplanes and amphibians are usually divided into two categories based on their technological characteristics: floatplanes and flying boats; the latter are generally far larger and can carry far more. These aircraft were sometimes called hydroplanes, but currently this term applies instead to motor-powered watercraft that use the technique of hydrodynamic lift to skim the surface of water when running at speed.|$|R
5000|$|Early manned {{spacecraft}} {{launched by the}} United States were designed <b>to</b> <b>alight</b> <b>on</b> <b>water</b> by the splashdown method. The craft would parachute into the water, which acted as a cushion to bring the craft to a stop; the impacts were violent but survivable. Alighting over water rather than land made braking rockets unnecessary, but its disadvantages included difficult retrieval and the danger of drowning. The NASA Space Shuttle design was intended to land on a runway instead. Some future spacecraft are planning <b>to</b> permit <b>water</b> alightings (SpaceX Dragon, Boeing CST-100, etc.) ...|$|R
50|$|They <b>alight</b> <b>on</b> <b>water</b> {{with their}} feet retracted. They rarely land <b>on</b> <b>water</b> {{with their feet}} {{stretched}} forward like pelicans or cormorants. When they are <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> their body is rather low in the water with their tail pointing diagonally upwards. They <b>alight</b> with difficulty <b>on</b> land and often with a bump as their narrow wings do {{not allow them to}} turn easily and they have to use their feet and tail to aid in these manoeuvres. Individuals often suffer damage to their legs or feet when they land on the ground if there is not sufficient wind. Damaged or broken wings are a frequent cause of death in adults. The position of the legs towards the rear of the body means that they walk in a similar way to ducks.|$|R
50|$|The LISA Akoya is a French {{single-engine}} light aircraft, seating two in side-by-side configuration. It is an amphibious aircraft {{capable of}} <b>alighting</b> <b>on</b> land, <b>water</b> or snow without adaptation.

50|$|As Helena remains helplessly pinned, another beam resumes {{probing the}} cargo area. <b>Alighting</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> tank, it intensifies. Pulled through the tank's walls, a {{jet of water}} streams across the module to be absorbed by the rock. After {{draining}} the container, the rock's pulsing glow strengthens. Helena relays these facts via the open commlock channel. Outside, Koenig and company realise the rock-forms need <b>water</b> <b>to</b> survive. Some meteorological event in the past stopped the rain cycle; over time, the rocks drained this planet dry. Many of the surrounding 'normal' rocks are probably deceased members of the species.|$|R
50|$|As large wading birds, {{great blue}} herons {{are capable of}} feeding in deeper waters, thus are able to harvest from niche areas not open to most other heron species. Typically, the great blue heron feeds in shallow waters, usually less than 50 cm deep, or at the water's edge during both the night and the day, but {{especially}} around dawn and dusk. The most commonly employed hunting technique of the species is wading slowly with its long legs through shallow water and quickly spearing fish or frogs with its long, sharp bill. Although usually ponderous in movements, the great blue heron is adaptable in its fishing methods. Feeding behaviors variably have consisted of standing in one place, probing, pecking, walking at slow speeds, moving quickly, flying short distances and alighting, hovering over water and picking up prey, diving headfirst into the <b>water,</b> <b>alighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>water</b> feet-first, jumping from perches feet-first, and swimming or floating {{on the surface of}} the water.|$|R
25|$|His Geese <b>Alighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>Water,</b> painted at Enman'in, Ōtsu in 1767, is {{an early}} example of his mature style. The subject is treated {{as a part of}} nature; nothing {{philosophical}} is implied as had been done with such imagery in the East Asian tradition. Likewise, Kingfisher and Trout, painted in 1769, features a bird {{near the top of the}} image, waiting for a fish. The trout swims under a large rock near the center. Bird, fish, and stone all appear as they do in nature, creating a matter-of-fact, comprehensible, and natural-looking piece. Later in his oeuvre, Pine Trees in Snow, executed in 1773 for the wealthy Mitsui family, is realistic despite being in the Japanese idiom of ink on a gold background. The two six-panel screens show tree bark and pine needles separated by differing brush strokes, and the white snow seems to weigh down the branches. The bark is painted in the tsuketate technique, which uses no outlines, just dark and light shades to create the illusion of volume.|$|R

50|$|The great frigatebird forages in pelagic waters within 80 km (50 mi) of the {{breeding}} colony or roosting areas. Flying {{fish from the}} family Exocoetidae {{are the most common}} item in the diet of the great frigatebird; other fish species and squid may be eaten as well. Prey is snatched while in flight, either from just below the surface or from the air in the case of flying fish flushed from the water. Great frigatebirds will make use of schools of predatory tuna or pods of dolphins that push schooling fish to the surface. Like all frigatebirds they will not <b>alight</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> surface and are usually incapable of taking off should they accidentally do so.|$|R

In accomplishing this feat he will <b>alight</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> and off again without wetting the upper leather of his boots. This marvellous feat has never been accomplished by any artist in this world." [...] More detail of this jump was given in an Australian publication: [...] "a tank {{is set in the}} middle of the stage, and is filled to the brim with water. Mr Darby takes a flying leap, and as he passes over the water be descends slightly. By this downward motion he, as it were, <b>alights</b> <b>on</b> the top of the water, and flies off again without wetting the upper leather of his boots." [...] When asked how hemanaged this feat, he replied: [...] "I really don't know, it comes naturally tome, though when I think of it myself it seems almost an impossibility." ...|$|R

On February 24, 1911, Curtiss made his first amphibian demonstration at North Island by taking off and <b>alighting</b> <b>on</b> both land and water. Back in Hammondsport, six months later in July 1911, Curtiss sold the U.S. Navy their first aircraft, the A-1 Triad. The A-1, which was primarily a seaplane, was equipped with retractable wheels, also making it the first amphibian. Curtiss trained the Navy's first pilots and built their first aircraft. For this, he is considered in the USA to be [...] "The Father of Naval Aviation". The Triad was immediately recognized as so obviously useful, it was purchased by the U.S. Navy, Russia, Japan, Germany and Britain. Curtiss won the Collier Trophy for designing this aircraft.|$|R

50|$|Like most gulls, Bonaparte's gull has {{a varied}} diet, with prey items {{changing}} {{over the course}} of the year, and from year to year. During the breeding season, it is largely insectivorous. It is known to quickly congregate in large numbers to take advantage of termite dispersal flights, circling over the emerging swarm and hovering briefly to take the insects in flight. It also gathers in large numbers to feed on the eggs of spawning salmon, <b>alighting</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> and, if necessary, diving to take drifting eggs. During migration and into the winter, insects are first supplemented, then replaced by other food items, including fish, small crustaceans, mollusks, euphausiids, marine worms, and other invertebrates. At least one immature bird has been recorded as having fed on walnut meat. Bonaparte's gulls are known to engage in kleptoparasitism, and have been observed stealing earthworms from foraging dunlins and black-bellied plovers.|$|R

He well knew those spotted silver sides, that broad, square tail. Such a monster! In his admiration for the fellow, and his wish for a hook and line to try conclusions with him, Joe momentarily forgot his object.
