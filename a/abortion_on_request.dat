50|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, many {{countries}} {{had begun to}} liberalize abortion laws, at least when performed to protect {{the life of the}} woman, and in some cases <b>on</b> woman's <b>request.</b> Under Vladimir Lenin, the Soviet Union legalized <b>abortions</b> <b>on</b> <b>request</b> in 1920 but in 1936 Joseph Stalin placed prohibitions <b>on</b> <b>abortions,</b> which restricted them to medically recommended cases only, in order to increase population growth. In the 1930s, several countries (Poland, Turkey, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, Mexico) legalized abortion in some special cases (pregnancy from rape, threat to mother's health, fetal malformation). In 1948 abortion was legalized in Japan, 1952 in Yugoslavia (on a limited basis), and 1955 in the Soviet Union (on demand). Some Soviet allies (Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Romania) legalized abortion in the late 1950s under pressure from the Soviets.|$|R

There are 50 countries (26%) that allow an abortion only if it is to save the mother’s life, 82 countries (42%) that allow abortion to save the mother’s life or for at least one of the following reasons: to preserve the woman’s physical health, to preserve the woman’s mental health, in the case of rape or incest, to avoid fetal impairment, or for economic or social reasons.

50|$|During the 1970s and 1980s, some British sociologists {{took a more}} sceptical {{approach}} {{to the question of}} the sixties 'permissive society', noting that it actually resulted in only partial and amended regulation of previously illegal and or stigmatised social activities. For example, the Sexual Offences Act 1967 decriminalised homosexuality but at an unequal age of consent, 21 (although it was subsequently reduced 18 (1994) and, finally, 16 (2002), additionally, the 1967 act decriminalised homosexuality only under limited circumstances. Similarly, the Abortion Act 1967 did not allow to <b>abortion</b> <b>on</b> <b>request</b> but required obtaining medical permission, with time limits. Furthermore, as with the case of cannabis decriminalisation, some instances of liberalised social attitudes were not met with legislative change. It is therefore important to note that the extent of 'permissiveness' that occurred in the 1960s may have been overstated. Some would argue that in the case of LGBT rights in the United Kingdom, Western Europe, Canada and New Zealand, the initial changes were only a prelude to further periods of legislative change: same sex marriage or civil unions and gay adoption have all occurred since the initial decriminalisation of homosexuality.|$|E
50|$|Abortions were legalized by {{a decree}} of the Ministry of Public Health on 27 April 1956, {{providing}} for abortions for all pregnancies {{within the first}} twelve weeks on any grounds, and only on therapeutic grounds thereafter. They were severely restricted by a Government decree of February 1968, issued to counter declining birth rates. Most abortions required approval by a special medical board, and they were banned entirely for childless women, with only medical exceptions. Only women over 45 or with three or more children could obtain an <b>abortion</b> <b>on</b> <b>request,</b> except if the pregnancy was past 10 weeks or the woman had obtained an abortion in the previous six months. The restrictions were extended in April 1973 to cover women with no children or only one child; abortions could only be obtained in case of rape or incest, for unmarried childless women under 18, for women over 45 with one living child, or in cases of disease endangering the woman's life or {{the viability of the}} fetus. The restrictions were slightly relaxed in 1974, but most restrictions remained until the decree of 1 February 1990.|$|E

5000|$|Despite a wide {{variation}} in the restrictions under which it is permitted, abortion is legal in most European countries.

5000|$|The {{immediate}} pre-revolutionary {{period was}} full of stops and starts {{in terms of social}} policy and family planning in Iran as the regime of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi fell in and out of favor with Iranians in quick fluctuation, eventually collapsing in the 1979 revolution. The pointed nationalism of the shah's government in the early 1960s made for a generally pronatal policy as the White Revolution began to reform social and economic law; families were encouraged to have children, and the country was set to expand until the shah began a national family planning program in 1967, when the country's extreme population growth made officials worry about resources diminishing too quickly. Abortion became legal at that time under a set of circumstances and restrictions; in fact, a law passed in 1977 even allowed <b>abortion</b> <b>on</b> <b>request.</b> A law a year earlier [...] "broadened access and granted an official license" [...] for abortions to be performed in medical facilities such as clinics and hospitals.

5000|$|There are, however, some exceptions.

40|$|Theory {{suggests}} that abortion restrictions will influence fertility outcomes such as pregnancy, abortion, and birth.

5000|$|Despite the {{approval}} of the 1955 edict and regulations, the problem of illegal abortions did not entirely disappear in the former USSR. This situation resulted in part from the government's conflicted attitude towards contraception. Although at times it manifested support for contraception, it did little to make contraception available and in 1974 effectively banned the widespread use of oral contraceptives. The situation was also due in part to a revived pronatalist approach to childbearing adopted at times by the government, which looked unfavourably <b>on</b> <b>abortion.</b> The result was a reliance <b>on</b> <b>abortion</b> as the primary method of family planning. [...] Concerned with the high rate of illegal abortions, in 1982 the government issued a decree allowing abortions for health reasons to be performed through the twenty-eighth week of pregnancy. The government continued to extend the circumstances under which legal abortions were available, and on 31 December 1987 it issued another decree setting out a broad range of non-medical indications for <b>abortions</b> performed <b>on</b> <b>request</b> through the twenty-eighth week of pregnancy. These were: the death of the husband during pregnancy; imprisonment of the pregnant woman or her husband; deprivation of maternity rights; multiparity (the number of children exceeds five); divorce during pregnancy; pregnancy following rape; and child disability in the family. Moreover, the order provided that, with {{the approval}} of a commission, an <b>abortion</b> could performed <b>on</b> any other ground.|$|R

Through cluster analysis, three contrasting personal positions were found: Never acceptable, depending on circumstances, and always acceptable. The judgment rule of participants adopting the "depending" position was: Acceptability = Fetus' age + Schooling plans + Partner's agreement + (Parent's agreement x Adolescent's age).

The {{national}} maternal mortali-ty ratio is 472 deaths per 100, 000 live births, more than ten times {{higher than that of}} Thailand and more than three times higher than that of neighboring Vietnam (NIPH et al. 2006). Although postpartum hemorrhage (25 percent), sepsis (15 percent), and unsafe abortion (13 percent) are the most prevalent causes of maternal mortality world-wide, Southeast Asia faces a disproportionate burden of maternal deaths due to unsafe abortion (14 – 16 percent), a particularly noteworthy burden because several coun-tries in the region allow <b>abortion</b> <b>on</b> <b>request</b> (WHO 2007). The World Health Organization defines an unsafe abor-tion as any procedure intended to terminate an undesired pregnancy that is provided by persons lacking the neces-sary skills and/or conducted in an environment lacking minimal medical standards (WHO 2003). Abortion in Cambodia is increasingly common and potentially unsafe.
