40|$|Abstract. Automotive {{industry}} is {{being one of}} the major supporting forces for the economy of many countries. The requirement of higher standard on safety figure for cars has demanded engineers to design automobile airbag systems with high performance. Since the ignition system {{is one of the major}} units in an airbag system, a design of a high-voltage piezoelectric converter which can be implemented in <b>airbag</b> <b>ignition</b> systems is studied in this paper. The selection of the piezoelectric transformer can improve the reliability by increasing the ignition energy. Using the multi-point ignition scheme to measure the orientation of the airbag detonation, the accuracy of the <b>airbag</b> <b>ignition</b> can be improved and the accidental injury caused by collisions can be further reduced. Besides, a good solution to synchronization problems is provided by using multi-point synchronization control and multiple air bags...|$|E

In the late-stage of {{designing}} an airbag control system, {{a lot of}} collision experiments {{should be done to}} verify the performance of the system, but collision experiments cost {{a lot of time and}} money. In this paper, we design a new development and testing platform that can generate multi-channel acceleration analog signals and provide multi-channel <b>airbag</b> <b>ignition</b> interfaces. The platform receives the acceleration data customized on PC via a USB interface, then, the PC issues a command to start the output of the acceleration waveforms. The <b>airbag</b> <b>ignition</b> interface has the same electrical characteristics with real airbag, when it receives an ignition current, the platform will ignite the virtual airbag, and record the time. The experimental results show that the platform designed in this paper can precisely simulate the acceleration waveforms collected in collision experiments...|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "Hirtenberg" [...] {{is derived}} from the name of a small castle - the Feste Huotto - which was located on a hill {{overlooking}} the valley of the Triesting. At {{the end of the first}} Turkish war in 1532 the army of Kasim Bey was defeated in the area of Hirtenberg.With the beginning of the 20th century some industrial companies were founded: a weaving company, the Otto Eberhardt Patronenfabrik ammunition factory (with a KZ Mauthausen subcamp), and a steel producing company. Because of this fact the coat of arms of Hirtenberg contains an industrial building with three chimneys. The big companies are now far smaller and employ far fewer people than before and turned to produce different things like <b>airbag</b> <b>ignitions,</b> steel lockers or car rims.|$|R
50|$|Columbite-tantalite (or coltan, the colloquial African term) is {{the metal}} ore {{from which the}} element {{tantalum}} is extracted. Tantalum is used primarily {{for the production of}} tantalum capacitors, particularly for applications requiring high performance, a small compact format and high reliability, from hearing aids and pacemakers, to <b>airbags,</b> GPS, <b>ignition</b> systems and anti-lock braking systems in automobiles, through to laptop computers, mobile phones, video game consoles, video cameras and digital cameras. In its carbide form, tantalum possesses significant hardness and wear resistance properties. As a result, it is used in jet engine/turbine blades, drill bits, end mills and other tools.|$|R
