5|$|Linois sailed from Toulon on 13 June 1801 {{with three}} ships {{of the line}} and one frigate {{carrying}} 1,560 soldiers under Brigadier-General Devaux. Ganteaume's earlier expedition was still in the Eastern Mediterranean, and so the British blockade force under Sir John Borlase Warren detailed to watch Toulon was instead off Malta hoping to intercept Ganteaume on his return. Therefore, the only British ships on hand when Linois emerged from the port were a few frigates, which were easily chased away by the larger warships of the French squadron. Linois's passage was slow, facing winds from the southwest that delayed his squadron so that by the 30 June they were only off Cape de Gata in the <b>Alboran</b> <b>Sea.</b> On 1 July they were spotted from Gibraltar, although the only warship there was the 14-gun HMS Calpe under Captain George Dundas which was unable to influence their advance. Instead, Captain Dundas ordered Lieutenant Richard Janvarin to take a boat and communicate with the Cadiz blockade force of seven ships of the line, under Saumarez.|$|E

40|$|Pollen-based climate reconstructions were {{performed}} on two high-resolution pollen – marines cores from the <b>Alboran</b> and Aegean <b>Seas</b> in order to unravel the climatic variability in the coastal settings of the Mediterranean region between 15 000 and 4000 cal yrs BP (the Lateglacial, and early to mid-Holocene). The quantitative climate reconstructions for the <b>Alboran</b> and Aegean <b>Sea</b> records focus mainly on {{the reconstruction of the}} seasonality changes (temperatures and precipitation), a crucial parameter in the Mediterranean region. This study is based on a multi-method approach comprising 3 methods: the Modern Analogues Technique (MAT), the recent Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling/Generalized Additive Model method (NMDS/GAM) and Partial Least Squares regression (PLS). The climate signal inferred from this comparative approach confirms that cold and dry conditions prevailed in the Mediterranean region during the Heinrich event 1 and Younger Dryas periods, while temperate conditions prevailed during the Bølling/Allerød and the Holocene. Our records suggest a West/East gradient of decreasing precipitation across the Mediterranean region during the cooler Late-glacial and early Holocene periods, similar to present-day conditions. Winter precipitation was highest during warm intervals and lowest during cooling phases. Several short-lived cool intervals (i. e., Older Dryas, another oscillation after this one (GI- 1 c 2), Gerzensee/Preboreal Oscillations, 8. 2 ka event, Bond events) connected to the North Atlantic climate system are documented in the <b>Alboran</b> and Aegean <b>Sea</b> records indicating that the climate oscillations associated with the successive steps of the deglaciation in the North Atlantic area occurred in both the western and eastern Mediterranean regions. This observation confirms the presence of strong climatic linkages between the North Atlantic and Mediterranean regions...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} water masses {{worldwide}} (their formation, spreading, mixing, and impact on general circulation) {{is essential for}} {{a better understanding of}} the ocean circulation and variability. In this paper, the formation and main pathways of Winter Intermediate Water (WIW) in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea (NWMED) are investigated during the winter-spring 2011 using observations and numerical simulation. The main results show that the WIW, formed along the continental shelves of the Gulf of Lion and Balearic Sea, circulates southward following five preferential pathways depending on the WIW formation site location and the oceanic conditions. WIW joins the northeastern part of the Balearic Sea, or flows along the continental shelves until joining the Balearic Current (maximum of 0. 33 Sv in early-April) or further south until the Ibiza Channel entrance. Two additional trajectories, contributing to water mass exchanges with the southern part of the Western Mediterranean Sea, bring the WIW through the Ibiza and Mallorca Channels (maxima of 0. 26 Sv in late-March and 0. 1 Sv in early-April, respectively). The circulation of WIW over the NWMED at 50 - 200 m depth, its mixing and spreading over the Western Mediterranean Sea (reaching the south of the Balearic Islands, the Algero-Provencal basin, the Ligurian and the <b>Alboran</b> <b>Seas)</b> suggest that the WIW may have an impact on the ocean circulation by eddy blocking effect, exchange of water masses between north and south subbasins of Western Mediterranean Sea through the Ibiza Channel or modification of the ocean stratification.

40|$|International audienceNine depth-profiles of {{dissolved}} Nd concentrations and isotopic ratios (epsilon(Nd)) {{were obtained}} in the Levantine Basin, the Ionian, the Aegean, the <b>Alboran</b> <b>Seas</b> and the Strait of Gibraltar. Thirteen core-top sediments and Nile River particle samples were also analyzed (leached with 1 N HCl, acetic acid or hydroxylamine hydrochloride). The seawater epsilon(Nd) values become more radiogenic during the eastward circulation in the Mediterranean Sea. The relationship between salinity and the seawater epsilon(Nd) shows that the Nd isotopic signature is more conservative than salinity in the Mediterranean Sea. The water mass with the highest epsilon(Nd) (- 4. 8) is found at about 200 m in the easternmost Levantine basin. The average epsilon(Nd) value for deep waters is - 7. 0 in the eastern basin, 2. 5 epsilon-units {{higher than in the}} western basin. By examining the sensitivity of seawater epsilon(Nd) to Nd inputs from the Nile, we conclude that the most significant radiogenic Nd source is partially dissolved Nile River particles. The Nd flux from the Nile River water has a minor influence on the Mediterranean seawater eNd. Except for the easternmost Levantine Basin, the leachate epsilon(Nd) values are consistent with the seawater values. In the easternmost Levantine Basin, the leachate eNd values obtained with HCl leaching are systematically higher than the seawater values. The relationship between leachate and residual epsilon(Nd) values indicates that the HCl leaching partially dissolves lithogenic Nd, so the dissolution of Nile River particles is the cause of the observed shift. Some eNd values obtained with hydroxylamine hydrochloride leaching are higher than those obtained with HCl leaching. Although the reason for this shift is not clear, Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 successfully detects the presence of a nonmarine component in the leachate. Our results suggest that leaching performance may vary with the mineralogy of marine sediments, at least {{in the case of the}} Mediterranean Sea. Copyright (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

500|$|On 30 January, {{shortly before}} the {{separated}} squadron was reunited off Cape Spartel, Ganteaume's ships also encountered a British vessel, chasing down the small fireship [...] under Commander Richard Dalling Dunn. Incendiary was unable to resist the larger warships and after they had removed her crew her captors set fire to Incendiary, scuttling her. After passing southwards together, the united squadron reached the Straits of Gibraltar on 9 February and passed through them without resistance. As most of the British fleet was operating in the Mediterranean Sea and no news of Ganteaume's operation had yet reached the authorities at Gibraltar, the only Royal Navy ship on hand to observe the French squadron was the 32-gun frigate HMS Success under Captain Shuldham Peard that lay at anchor off the British base. Peard correctly assumed that the French squadron was sailing for Egypt and decided to follow them, shadowing the French during 10 February. That day the French captured and scuttled the 10-gun cutter [...] In the evening, Ganteaume called his ships to a halt off Cape de Gata in the <b>Alboran</b> <b>Sea</b> and Peard unwittingly passed them in the night, {{so that by the}} morning of 11 February the French were in a position to pursue his frigate.|$|E

Analysis of 29, 822 recording hours revealed typical long, patterned sequences of 20 Hz notes (here called “song”), back-beats, 135 – 140 Hz notes, and downsweeps. Acoustic parameters (internote interval, note duration, frequency range, center and peak frequencies) were statistically compared among songs and song notes recorded in all areas. Fin whale singers producing songs attributable to the northeastern North Atlantic subpopulation were detected crossing the Strait of Gibraltar and wintering in the southwestern Mediterranean <b>Sea</b> (<b>Alboran</b> basin), while songs attributed to the Mediterranean were detected in the northwest Mediterranean basin. These results suggest that the northeastern North Atlantic fin whale distribution extends into the southwest Mediterranean basin, and spatial and temporal overlap may exist between this subpopulation and the Mediterranean subpopulation.

The main objective of the NEREIDA project is to gather information for the identification and delineation of VMEs in the NAFO Regulatory Area with special focus on those dominated by deep-water corals and sponges. This demarcation is a necessary step in the decision making process for the protection of these areas. The NEREIDA data collection programme comprised six research cruises conducted between May and July of 2009 and June and August 2010, aboard the Spanish R/V Miguel Oliver. In 2009, surveys were conducted to the east, north and west of the Flemish Cap and Flemish Pass, whereas in 2010, surveys covered the area south of the Flemish Cap and along the slope of the Tail of the Grand Bank of Newfoundland.

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} coupled {{physical and}} intermediate-complexity biochemical model comprising {{large and small}} phytoplankton and zooplankton groups, particulate organic nitrogen, ammonium and nitrate was developed to study the physical-biogeochemical interactions and parameters that control plankton production in the <b>Alboran</b> and Balearic <b>Sea</b> ecosystems. The model findings suggest that pelagic fish predation and resource availability through lateral and vertical nutrient inputs jointly characterize the plankton community structures. In agreement with previous observations, a typical annual plankton structure of the mesotrophic systems involves a vertically homogeneous biomass of large groups of phytoplankton and zooplankton within the upper 50 -to- 100 m layer from mid-November to April and a subsurface biomass accumulation distributed roughly within 25 - 75 m depths in the following months. Their light and temperature limitations constrain the smaller groups primarly into the thermocline zone (25 - 50 m) during late spring and summer. These obtained results were dependent on the zooplankton actively switching between prey (i. e., the food preference coefficients dependent on prey biomass). In the case of no switching, spurious dynamic equilibrium solutions may arise {{in the case of}} a constant and weak fish predation rate and using the quadratic predation formulation. The choice of a Holling Type II (i. e., hyperbolic) predation function may, however avoid ambiguous representation of the annual plankton structure {{in the case of a}} constant food preference choice under relatively weak predation pressures.

The South American continent drifted to the west towards the subduction zone in the Pacific, during this process the Andes were folded. During the Pliocene (...) the land bridge between South America and North America was formed, and the fauna exchange started. The formation of this land bridge also affected global climate. The Indian subcontinent continued its collision with Asia, but added a westward movement as well, leading to the folding of the Caucasus. The folding of the Himalaya continues until today. The collision of Africa with Europe {{and the rise of}} the lithosphere under the <b>Alborán</b> <b>Sea</b> (westernmost Mediterranean) lead to the separation of the Mediterranean from the Atlantic Ocean. During this period, that lasted 600,000 years (...) , the Mediterranean desiccated nearly completely (Messinian salinity crisis). Only at the end of this period the desiccated basin was flooded through a narrow canal near Gibraltar, according to today's view quickly, but without catastrophic effects. The Neogene was a period of global cooling, which finally led to the Pleistocene ice age. At the beginning of the Miocene, temperatures in the northern hemisphere initially were still temperate. However, by the formation of the land bridge between South America and North America, the warm ocean current was cut off and the polar caps cooled down dramatically. During the Gelasian period ice sheets began to form both in the Arctic and Antarctic region. This marked the starting point of a new ice age which continues until today, with glacial cycles and intermittent warmer periods (interglacials). During the glacials the continental glaciers pushed to the 40th parallel in some regions and covered major parts of North America, Europe and Siberia. Each glacial advance tied up large volumes of water and the sea levels dropped globally by around 100 m. During the interglacials, the sea level rose again and coastal flooding was common during this time.|$|E
40|$|The Mediterranean Sea {{desiccated}} 5. 96 {{million years}} ago when it became isolated from the world oceans during the Messinian salinity crisis. This event permitted the exchange of terrestrial biota between Africa and Iberia contributing to the present rich biodiversity of the Mediterranean region. The cause chocking the Mediterranean has been proposed to be tectonic uplift and dynamic topography but the driving mechanism still remains debated. We present a new wide-angle seismic profile that provides a detailed image of the thickness and seismic velocity distribution of the crust in the eastern Alboran basin. The velocity model shows a characteristic structure of a subduction-related volcanic arc with a high-velocity lower crust and a 16 - 18 km total-thickness igneous crust that magmatic accreted mostly between 10 - 6 Ma across the eastern Alboran basin. Estimation of the isostatically corrected depth of the arc crust {{taking into account the}} original thermal structure and sediment-loading subsidence since 6 Ma places a large area of the eastern <b>Alboran</b> basin above <b>sea</b> level at the time.
