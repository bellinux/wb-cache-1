40|$|Spectrum auctions {{are used}} by governments to assign and price {{licenses}} for wireless communications. The standard approach is the simultaneous ascending auction, in which many related lots are auctioned simultaneously in a sequence of rounds. I analyze {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the approach with examples from US spectrum auctions. I then present a variation, the package clock auction, adopted by the UK, which addresses many of the problems of the simultaneous ascending auction while building on its strengths. The package clock auction is a simple dynamic auction in which bidders bid on packages of lots. Most importantly, the auction allows alternative technologies that require the spectrum to be organized in different ways to compete in a technology‐neutral auction. In addition, the pricing rule and information policy are carefully tailored to mitigate gaming behavior. An activity rule based on revealed preference promotes price and assignment discovery throughout the clock stage of the auction. Truthful bidding is encouraged, which simplifies bidding and improves efficiency. Experimental tests and early auctions confirm the advantages of the approach. (JEL D 44, C 78, L 96.

40|$|We analyze a {{discrete}} <b>clock</b> <b>auction</b> with lowest-accepted bid (LAB) pricing and provisional winners, as adopted by India for its 3 G spectrum auction. In a perfect Bayesian equilibrium, the provisional winner shades her bid while provisional losers do not. Such differential shading leads to inefficiency.

An auction with highest-rejected bid (HRB) pricing and exit bids is strategically simple, has no bid shading, and is fully efficient. In addition, it has higher revenues than the LAB auction, assuming profit maximizing bidders. The bid shading in the LAB auction exposes bidders {{to the possibility of}} losing the auction at a price below the bidder's value. Thus, fear of losing may cause bidders in the LAB auction to bid more aggressively than predicted assuming profit-maximizing bidders. We extend the model by adding an anticipated loser's regret to the payoff function. Revenue from the LAB auction yields higher expected revenue than the HRB auction when bidders' fear of losing at profitable prices is sufficiently strong. This would provide one explanation why India, with an expressed objective of revenue maximization, adopted the LAB auction for its upcoming 3 G spectrum auction, rather than the seemingly superior HRB <b>auction.</b> <b>Auctions,</b> <b>clock</b> <b>auctions,</b> spectrum auctions, behavioral economics, market design...|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I study bidding {{behavior in}} Internet Auction Markets. I focus on practice called "multiple bidding" which {{occurs when a}} single bidder places numerous bids throughout the same auction. Multiple bidding appears frequently in the data but the incentives that motivate it are not well understood. In the first chapter I develop a theoretical model in which multiple bidding is an equilibrium behavior by rational bidders. The model has a dynamic auction with two bidders who can search for outside prices while bidding in the auction. Each bidder has a search cost which is her private information. When outside prices are private (independently drawn and identically distributed), then, there is an equilibrium in which bidders with the lower search costs bid only late and always search, while the bidders with higher search costs bid both early and late and search as if they coordinated their search decisions, i. e., the bidder with the lower search cost searches and the other bidder does not. This equilibrium by itself provides an explanation of two frequently occurring bidding patterns (late and multiple bidding). In the second chapter I study experimentally the effect of early bids in dynamic auctions on how bidders search for outside prices. The design has two bidders participating in an ascending clock-auction during which {{any one of the}} bidders can pause the <b>auction</b> <b>clock.</b> This I interpret as placing an early bid. Once the auction is paused both bidders can simultaneously search for an alternative outside price. Results indicate that pausing decisions by subjects impact their subsequent searching for outside prices, i. e., whether a subject decides to search or not depends on whether she has paused the auction or not. Subjects behave as if they coordinated their searching decisions: the bidder who pauses the auction also searches with high frequency and the other bidder does not. Because this type of behavior increases both the efficiency and the profitability of the auction we favor the use of policies that promote early bidding in practice, such as, longer auctions and lower public reserve prices...|$|E

Full {{efficiency}} is generally unachievable with a discrete auction. Since {{there may be more}} than one bidder who submits the same bid, the auction cannot completely sort bidders by valuation. In effort to maximize efficiency, the social planner tries to choose the partition rule-a rule dictating how type space is partitioned to group bidders who submit the same bid together-to maximize efficiency. With the efficient partition rule, we implement bid levels with sealed-bid and <b>clock</b> <b>auctions.</b> We find that the efficient bid levels in the sealed-bid second-price auction may be non-unique and efficient bid increments in a <b>clock</b> <b>auction</b> with highest-rejected bid may be decreasing. We also show that revealing demand is efficiency-enhancing even in the independent private valuation setting where price discovery is not important.

40|$|Combinatorial auctions {{have been}} {{suggested}} {{as a means to}} raise efficiency in multi-item negotiations with complementarities among goods as they can be found in procurement, energy markets, transportation, and the sale of spectrum <b>auctions.</b> The Combinatorial <b>Clock</b> (CC) <b>auction</b> has become very popular in these markets for its simplicity and for its highly usable price discovery, derived by the use of linear prices. Unfortunately, no equilibrium bidding strategies are known. Given the importance of the CC auction in the field, it is highly desirable to understand whether there are efficient versions of the CC auction, providing a strong game theoretical solution concept. So far, equilibrium strategies have only been found for combinatorial auctions with non-linear and personalized prices for very restricted sets of bidder valuations. We provide an extension of the CC auction, the CC+ auction, and show that it actually leads to efficient outcomes in an ex-post equilibrium for general valuations with only linear ask prices. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the worst case efficiency of the CC auction, which highlights problems in the valuations, in which the CC is very inefficient. As in all other theoretical models of combinatorial auctions, bidders in the field {{might not be able to}} follow the equilibrium strategies suggested by the game-theoretical predictions. Therefore, we complement the theoretical findings with results from computational experiments using realistic value models. This analysis helps to understand the impact of deviations from the equilibrium strategy and the robustness of such auctions.

We formulate the problem as a combinatorial call auction and present a portfolio of three solution approaches that trade off economic properties, such as allocative efficiency, incentive compatibility, and fairness in allocation, with computational efficiency.

Finally, for markets that require real-time fast solution techniques, we propose a time sensitive fair Grid (tsfGRID) heuristic. Notably, while incentive compatibility is not guaranteed by tsfGRID, computational results comparing it with the efficient solution technique indicate {{that there are no}} significant differences in the expected revenue and operational allocative characteristics. ^ In the second study, we design a market-based <b>clock</b> <b>auction</b> model that is able to allocate grid resources and discover separate prices for the different computing resources in the event of stochastic demand as opposed to the first study where the demand was assumed to be deterministic.
