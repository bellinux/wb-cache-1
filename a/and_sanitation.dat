5|$|According to the report, {{the average}} annual {{transfers}} from the national government to the municipalities for water supply <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> (including solid waste) were about US$278m between 1998 and 2001. 86% of that funding was allocated through the SGP as defined in Law 715. A certain percentage of these resources was dedicated exclusively for water supply <b>and</b> <b>sanitation.</b> They mainly go to small municipalities that show low income levels. Nevertheless, many municipalities use funding through SGP dedicated for water supply <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> for other purposes.|$|E

5|$|Water supply <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> in Colombia {{has been}} {{improved}} {{in many ways}} over the past decades. Between 1990 and 2010, access to improved sanitation increased from 67% to 82%, but access to improved water source's increased only slightly from 89% to 94%. In particular, coverage in rural areas lags behind. Furthermore, despite improvements, the quality of water <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> services remains inadequate. For example, only 73% of those receiving public services receive water of potable quality and in 2006 only 25% of the wastewater generated in the country underwent any kind of treatment.|$|E

5|$|New {{environmental}} technologies in heating, lighting, ventilation <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> were also critical to creating taller buildings that were attractive to work in. Central heating {{could not be}} easily extended to serve larger buildings; in the 1850s, a system using low-pressure steam and steam-operated fans became adopted {{in the construction of}} the later skyscrapers. Many U.S. buildings were lit by gas, but this carried safety risks and was difficult to install in taller buildings. As an alternative, electric lights were installed from 1878 onwards, powered by basement generators. Ventilation was also a challenge, as smoke drifting into offices from the streets and the fumes from the gas lighting made air quality a major health issue. A steam-driven, forced-draft ventilation system was invented in 1860 and became widely used in taller buildings by the 1870s, overcoming much of the problem. Improvements in iron piping permitted running hot and cold water <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> facilities to be installed throughout taller buildings for the first time.|$|E
