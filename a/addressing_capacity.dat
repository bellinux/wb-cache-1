50|$|As {{demand for}} {{telephone}} service {{grew in the}} post-World War II period, it was foreseeable that the demand would exceed the <b>addressing</b> <b>capacity</b> of the existing system of using memorable telephone central office names as prefixes in telephone numbers. Several letter combinations had no pronounceable or memorable names {{and could not be}} used. Several North American numbering plan areas (NPAs) were divided so that more office codes became available to smaller regions. However, as the growth accelerated, the Bell System decided to implement all-number calling (ANC) and to deprecate the use of central office names to provide more central office codes to each NPA. This extended the usable numbering plan and only two area code splits became necessary between 1962 and 1981. All-number calling was phased in starting in 1958 and most areas had adopted it fully by the mid-1960s. In some areas it did not become universal until the 1980s. The Bell System published and distributed area code handbooks yearly which compiled the towns available for calling using an area code.|$|E

It examines the recent history of decentralised systems' implementation in Australia and identifies its drivers. The drivers included <b>addressing</b> <b>capacity</b> constraints of centralised systems, mitigating the environmental impact of urban development, and increasing the resilience of urban water systems to episodic droughts and the projected impacts of climate change. The concepts of integrated urban water management and water sensitive urban design were prevalent in many of the innovative approaches used for the provision of decentralised urban water services. However, there remains a degree of confusion among water professionals in the terminology adopted for on-site and decentralised systems. Based on a literature review, consultation with water industry professionals and examination of decentralised urban developments in Australia, this paper has developed a generalised definition of decentralised systems for adoption across the water sector.

40|$|<b>Addressing</b> <b>capacity</b> fading during {{electrochemical}} cycling {{is one of}} {{the most}} challenging issues of lithium-ion batteries based on LiMn 2 O 4. Accordingly, in this work, an ester-functionalized ionic liquid, N-methylpyrrolidinium-N-acetate bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([MMEPyr][TFSI]), was designed as an additive to the electrolyte employed for Li/LiMn 2 O 4 batteries to improve their electrochemical performance. A systematic comparative study was carried out using the LiTFSI-based electrolyte with and without [MMEPyr][TFSI] additive. After 100 cycles, the Li/LiMn 2 O 4 half-cells retained 94 % of their initial discharge capacity in the electrolyte containing 10 wt-% [MMEPyr][TFSI]. However, the cycling capacity of the half-cells in the electrolyte without [MMEPyr][TFSI] decreased considerably to, similar to 21 mAhg(- 1) within the first 10 cycles. One of the main reasons for the decrease is the stabilization of the Al current collector by the [MMEPyr][TFSI] additive, as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Moreover, the Li/LiMn 2 O 4 cells in the electrolyte containing [MMEPyr][TFSI] displayed high-rate performance, whereby similar to 90 % of the cell initial discharge capacity was retained at 2. 5 C. </p...|$|E

The authors challenge {{the use of the term}} vikonym as applied to rural place names. Instead, the term rusticonym is suggested as more appropriate in both semantic and morphological aspects.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{hypothesis}} that the post-Cold War establishment of national export control systems in former Soviet states displays organized hypocrisy. Organized hypocrisy is a phenomenon in which formal organizational structures adopted for symbolic purposes are decoupled from actual behavior. It arises as a response to inconsistent pressures on organizations deriving from the organizational environment. Since the end of the Cold War, former Soviet states have, with Western pressure and assistance, developed national legal and regulatory systems to control the export and transshipment of goods and technologies with applications in the development of weapons of mass destruction. While this has resulted in the establishment of formal structures and procedural arrangements conforming, to varying degrees, to international standards, the mere existence of national export control systems has not translated into consistent implementation and enforcement. This discrepancy has generally been treated as a problem arising from a lack of capacity (resources and expertise to effectively enforce export controls) or political will within former Soviet states. Current policies, appropriate for <b>addressing</b> <b>capacity</b> problems, are unlikely to affect implementation problems arising from organized hypocrisy. This paper surveys relevant theoretical and methodological issues, and policy implications, and presents a plausibility probe of {{the hypothesis that}} organized hypocrisy has effects in the export control area that are not reducible to lack of capacity or political will...|$|E

IPv 6 offers various features including Larger <b>addressing</b> <b>capacity</b> and capabilities, QoS control, encryption and decryption,mobility, routing,security,real time applications like video and audio.

40|$|This Article {{calls for}} the overruling of the central rule in Hunter v. City of Pittsburgh (1907) on Erie grounds. Hunter {{announced}} {{as a matter of}} federal law that local governments are powerless instrumentalities of state governments. Legal scholars have criticized Hunter for exacerbating the doctrinal and practical problems that plague local government law. This Article goes further by challenging Hunter directly. It argues first that Erie v. Tompkins (1938), properly read, effectively overruled the central rule in Hunter. Second, it argues that we should not mourn the loss of that rule because its analytic support structures are historically, doctrinally, and logically defective. The Article then narrows its focus to a doctrine derived from Hunter, the federal rule barring localities from invoking the Constitution against their own states (the 2 ̆ 2 Hunter doctrine 2 ̆ 2). It argues that after Erie, the Hunter doctrine is best understood as a doctrine <b>addressing</b> <b>capacity</b> to sue; that federal courts should defer to state law in deciding whether a particular locality has the capacity to bring a constitutional challenge against its own state rather than superimposing a national rule; and that courts and scholars should welcome localities into constitutional debates because their full participation is pro-local and pro-democratic, and would raise the overall competence of constitutional debate and local public advocacy. Finally, looking to the future, the Article calls for scholars to address which of the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s provisions should apply to localities qua localities; to consider the circumstances under which the Court should permit localities to pursue representative constitutional claims on behalf of their constituents; and to develop an alternative, post-Hunter theoretical framework for local government law...|$|E

The National Science Foundation (NSF) Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) was created in the late 1970 s and was designed to enhance the research capacity of less competitive states in seeking federal research funds. How has EPSCoR improved research capacity in its member states? To date, little evaluation of EPSCoR as a program, or even within individual states, has occurred, and those studies that have been conducted have taken a statewide, macro-level approach. We argue that a social-capital-based approach that <b>addresses</b> <b>capacity</b> development among EPSCoR recipients provides important scientist-level data that can best <b>address</b> <b>capacity</b> development issues. In this article, we first examine the data of federal academic R&D obligations in order to analyze one of the direct outcomes of capacity building. We conduct a descriptive statistical analysis on the changing share of federal academic R&D obligations for individual states in recent years. Second, using an NSF-sponsored survey of scientists in the 50 states, we present data on distinctions between scientists in EPSCoR versus non-EPSCoR states, as well as differences between scientists who have been involved in EPSCoR versus those who have not. From our analysis we find important evidence of capacity development in EPSCoR states.
