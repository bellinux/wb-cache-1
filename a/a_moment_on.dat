The player guides {{them to the}} cafeteria to plant their timed propane bombs without being detected by security cameras or hall monitors. After the explosives are set, the two stop for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> a hill outside the school, discussing their alienation and hostility. After the bombs fail to explode as planned, Harris and Klebold decide to enter the school and murder {{as many people as}} they can; the final number killed is up to the player. After roaming around the school shooting innocents, Harris and Klebold commit suicide. A montage of clips showing Harris and Klebold's corpses, students comforting each other, and childhood photos of the gunmen plays.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>Moment</b> <b>on</b> the Earth {{proved to}} be very controversial, {{especially}} among environmentalists. Easterbrook was accused of mischaracterizing data concerning environmental health, using faulty logic, and being overly optimistic. Other reviewers, like Michael Specter in The New York Times, had praise for the book's efforts to raise positive points {{in the debate over}} environmental policy.|$|E
500|$|The {{head of the}} {{household}} takes a jug of wine and pours some on the badnjak; in some regions, he may strew wheat grains over the logs. He then proposes a toast: [...] "Grant, O God, that there be health and joy in this home, that our grain and grapevines yield well, that children be born healthy to us, that our property increase in the field, pen, and barn!" [...] or, [...] "Hail, badnjak, veseljak! I give you wheat and wine, and you give me every good thing and peace!" [...] or similar. The name veseljak, literally [...] "jovial one", is used along with badnjak in some areas. The head drinks a draught of wine from the jug, after which it is passed to other members of household. In the clan of Kuči, wine is poured on the [...] "beard" [...] of the badnjak, and then a little girl sits for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> the log—for the well-being of the cattle. Christmas Eve dinner follows, which traditionally includes a round loaf of unleavened bread, beans, fish, walnuts, honey, and red wine. The bread is not cut with a knife, but broken with hands.|$|E

500|$|In New York City, Carl {{presents}} [...] "Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World" [...] on Broadway, starring Baxter and an imprisoned Kong. Ann {{is played}} by an anonymous chorus girl, and Kong becomes enraged after realizing that the girl on stage is not Ann. After breaking free from his chrome-steel chains, he wrecks the theater and chases Jack. Kong knocks Jack out by stopping his car and flipping it, then encounters Ann again. Kong and Ann share <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> a frozen pond in Central Park until the army attacks. Kong climbs with Ann onto {{the top of the}} Empire State Building, where he fights off six F8C-5 Helldiver Navy planes, downing three. At the end of the confrontation, Kong is mortally wounded by the gunfire and gazes at Ann for the last time before falling from the building to his death. As Ann is reunited with Jack, civilians, photographers, police and soldiers gather around Kong's corpse. Carl makes his way through the crowd, takes one last long look at Kong and says, [...] "It wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast." ...|$|E
500|$|U2 and McGuinness {{thought that}} too much money had been {{invested}} to abort the concert, and they sympathised with the fans who had travelled to the venue in the poor weather. Accordingly, they decided {{to proceed with the}} concert as planned. However, according to Ezratty, many of the crew were not in agreement and wanted to walk off the set. He said, [...] "The guys from the American sound company were not at all enamored with being out with this band. I can remember them saying, [...] "Oh, we could be out with Asia right now!' So they decided to pull the plug on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're going to pull the system down and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. It was cold and raining and everybody was shivering, and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career. He said that if it were deemed that this show was in any way possible to happen, it was going to happen, and it was not going to be tolerated that anybody would do anything but add their effort to a successful and positive outcome I just stood there and went, [...] "This is so cool. This is like a general rallying the troops.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Three days later, it was {{reported}} that Marvel was looking at Alan Taylor and Daniel Minahan as prospective directors to replace Jenkins, and were also in the midst of hiring a writer to rewrite Don Payne's script, with the shortlist of possible writers consisting of John Collee, Robert Rodat, and Roger Avary. At the end of the month, Alan Taylor, best known for directing episodes of the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones, was chosen to direct the sequel. Feige mentioned Taylor's work on the series Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones as reasons for his hiring, saying [...] "With Alan's direction we got a few more layers of patina, of texture, of reality into our golden realm." [...] By January 10, Marvel Studios had commissioned screenwriter Robert Rodat to rewrite the sequel and Hiddleston stated that filming was expected to begin in London in the summer of 2012. Hemsworth later confirmed that filming was scheduled to begin in August. Hemsworth also revealed that the film would have a more Viking-influenced feel, elaborating [...] "I think the science fiction element to Thor… the danger is it falls a little bit into the world of it's 'tough to throw a light to.' I think of big waterfalls and mountains and a Viking influence, where the Norse mythology kind of grew from. Having that in Asgard {{is going to make it}} all the more special and that's what Alan [...] wants to bring to it." [...] Feige said [...] "while the relationship between Loki and Thor certainly has changed [...] and has progressed, a lot of Thor 2 is picking up where it left off in terms of Jane, who you just saw for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> a computer monitor, and also what's been going on in the nine realms without the Asgardians being able to use the Bifrost." [...] Feige also said that while Loki has a part, [...] "there will be a different villain, another big villain".|$|E

2500|$|Norman Borlaug, one of {{the most}} {{important}} figures in the Green Revolution, was the subject of an admiring Easterbrook article in 1997, and again in 2009 marking Borlaug's passing. [...] Both articles said that Borlaug had disproved the earlier dire predictions of Paul R. Ehrlich, author of the 1968 book The Population Bomb. [...] Ehrlich has severely criticized Easterbrook’s 1995 book <b>A</b> <b>Moment</b> <b>on</b> the Earth.|$|E

He called the environmental movement [...] "among the most welcome social developments of the twentieth century," [...] but criticized environmentalists who promoted {{what he saw as}} overly pessimistic views that did not accept signs of improvement and progress.|$|E
2500|$|Teams in both {{shuttle and}} station flight control rooms in Houston were working their last shuttle shift.

2500|$|Though often oppressive, Crabbe's poetry had {{remarkable}} popular appeal, which Hazlitt {{attempts to}} explain by isolating two causes: the reading public was tiring of the formal, conventional, empty phrasing of most {{poetry of the}} day; and simultaneously there had been developing a public taste for painting. Something in Crabbe's The Village had caught {{the interest of the}} respected critic Dr. Johnson, but it was a painter, the famous Sir Joshua Reynolds, who in 1783 had brought it to his attention. The time was ripe for this kind of verse: Crabbe essentially paints in words, and his word paintings embody the attention to detail typical of Dutch and Flemish painters of the 17th century, a sharp and welcome relief from the vapid, conventional phraseology of much Augustan poetry. [...] "Painting is essentially an imitative art; it cannot subsist for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> empty generalities ... Mr. Crabbe ... paints in words, instead of colours." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{center of}} {{pressure}} [...] is {{the point where the}} total sum of a pressure field acts on a body, causing a force to act through that point. The total force vector acting at the {{center of pressure}} is the value of the integrated vectorial pressure field. [...] The resultant force and center of pressure location produce equivalent force and moment on the body as the original pressure field. Pressure fields occur in both static and dynamic fluid mechanics. [...] Specification of the center of pressure, the reference point from which the center of pressure is referenced, and the associated force vector allows the moment generated about any point to be computed by a translation from the reference point to the desired new point. It is common for the center of pressure to be located on the body, but in fluid flows it is possible for the pressure field to exert <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> the body of such magnitude that the center of pressure is located outside the body.|$|E
2500|$|British {{author and}} {{journalist}} William Shawcross several times {{makes the point}} that the Shah prohibited foreign governments from any contact with his domestic political opposition. Replying to one such request for access, by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, an 'irritated' Shah had replied, [...] "I will not have any guest of mine waste <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> these ridiculous people." [...] As with other ambassadors before and during his tenure, Helms was reluctant to cross the Shah on this point, because of the fear of [...] "being PNG'ed (made persona non grata)." [...] For any ambassador to do so [...] "would at the very least have jeopardized his country's export opportunities in Iran." [...] Consequently, [...] "American and other diplomats swam in a shallow pool of courtiers, industrialists, lawyers, and others who were somehow benefiting from the material success of the regime. ¶ ... people more or less licensed by the Shah." [...] About the immediate court, however, a U.N. official wrote, [...] "There was an atmosphere of overwhelming nouveau-riche, meretricious chi-chi and sycophancy ..." [...] Helms himself managed to circulate widely among the traditional elites, e.g., becoming a [...] "close friend" [...] of the aristocrat Ahmad Goreishi.|$|E
