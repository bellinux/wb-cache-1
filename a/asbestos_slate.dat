50|$|Great Hinton had {{a public}} house, The Linnet (originally called The New Inn), which closed in 2011. It is a Grade II listed {{building}} that {{was built in the}} mid-eighteenth century and has a brewhouse dated 1816. It is a brick building with <b>asbestos</b> <b>slate</b> roof and brick chimney stacks. The interior of the building has been modernised but the chamfered beams remain.|$|E
50|$|In 1918, {{woodwork}} {{and domestic}} science {{were added to}} the school curriculum, although no classrooms appear to have been designated specifically for these subjects. It is understood that Wooloowin was the first primary school to introduce these subjects, as provided for under the new syllabus provisions of 1915.The first addition to the school was constructed in 1918. It was a brick building, with 10ft wide verandahs; roughcast externally and roofed with <b>asbestos</b> <b>slate,</b> which mirrored the 1914 side wing. This brought the number of classrooms to six, and was opened in September 1918. By 1921, school enrolment had grown to over 800, and in 1923 plans were prepared for a second addition, a two-storeyed stuccoed brick building with an <b>asbestos</b> <b>slate</b> roof, containing four classrooms on each floor with hatrooms and a verandah and a balcony on the north side. This building was erected in 1925 at a cost of &pound;6,233, and opened in July that year.|$|E
50|$|Wooloowin State School's 1914. 1918 and 1925 {{buildings}} form {{a coherent}} group {{of one and}} two-storeyed classroom blocks linked together by verandahs. The buildings are masonry constructed on brick piers, which form an undercroft play area. Most of {{the exterior of the}} buildings are roughcast render. Originally the roof was covered with red <b>asbestos</b> <b>slates,</b> which has been replaced with corrugated iron. Each of the individual pavilions has a separate roof, with ventilators and projecting gabled skylights.|$|R
50|$|An {{octagonal}} spire {{stands on}} the southwest end of the ridge of a steep gabled roof, clad in <b>asbestos</b> cement <b>slates.</b> The spire, with pinnacle clad in smaller slates, has a lancet louvered vent to each face.|$|R
50|$|In 1898 the {{exterior}} walls, which were probably face brick work, were rendered. <b>Asbestos</b> roofing <b>slates</b> were substituted {{for the original}} wooden shingles in 1908, and an earlier weatherboarded and buttressed spire {{was replaced by the}} present structure in the same year.|$|R
50|$|Costislost is a Grade II listed {{house in}} the parish of Egloshayle in Cornwall, England. To the south are Costislost Plantations.It dates to {{probably}} the 17th century, and underwent remodelling in the 18th and 19th centuries. It has an <b>asbestos</b> <b>slate</b> roof with gable ends. A farmhouse for centuries, it is now run as a bed and breakfast. It belonged to the Lakeman family in the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|The {{gatehouse}} {{dates from}} the early 12th century and is a Grade I listed building. It is a three storey single-depth plan stone structure with an <b>asbestos</b> <b>slate</b> roof surmounted by turrets. A central carriage archway leads into a courtyard. The building was substantially altered in the 15th Century by the Courtenay family and restored in the 1920s and 1930s during the ownerships of Mr Francis Harper and Lt Col Jasper Henson.|$|E
50|$|The A361 {{is called}} Thames Street at this point, and {{the bridge was}} built when Thames Street was laid out. The {{structure}} is around 20 ft wide and the single arch is nearly 26 ft high to its apex. On the north bank of the river, a small square toll house {{is attached to the}} bridge on the downstream side. It consists of a basement and a room at road level, with a pyramidal <b>asbestos</b> <b>slate</b> roof. Both the bridge and the toll house are grade II listed. It is thought that a local firm of builders called Ralph and Crowdy were responsible for its construction. There is a separate arch in the south causeway, through which the towpath passes, and both parapets carry a central panel with a line on it, to mark the county boundary between Berkshire and Gloucestershire.|$|E

40|$|We {{attempted}} to melt and decompose <b>asbestos</b> in asbestos-containing <b>slate</b> panels solely by laser irradiation using compact laser irradiation equipment while varying the laser output (50 W), {{the number of}} pulses per inch (ppi) and the travel speed of the laser beam window. We found that slate panels could be decomposed and melted, even with the compact equipment, by irradiating {{both sides of the}} slates. No specific elements evaporated selectively during the melting. No asbestos-derived fiber was found in the molten material zone...|$|R
50|$|Further {{additions}} {{were required}} {{within a decade}} and, in 1915, a separate infants building was erected facing Oxford Street. It was a highset timber framed building erected on timber stumps to provide toilets and a play space underneath the building. It was clad in weatherboards with an <b>asbestos</b> cement <b>slate</b> roof and was lined internally with tongue and groove v-jointed boards to the walls and coved ceiling. The hat rooms {{at each end of}} the verandah were unlined internally and the remainder of the verandah had vertical balustrading. Two flights of uncovered external timber stairs provided access to the verandah between which the teachers' room was attached. The building comprised three classrooms with southern lighting and ventilation provided by a large bank of windows comprising casements, centre pivoting sashes and hoppers at the top to provide a variety of ventilation options. This arrangement was repeated, at the eastern and western ends of the building, both of which were protected by sunshades.|$|R
2500|$|The first plastic {{based on}} a {{synthetic}} polymer was made from phenol and formaldehyde, with the first viable and cheap synthesis methods invented in 1907, by Leo Hendrik Baekeland, a Belgian-born American living in New York state. Baekeland was looking for an insulating shellac to coat wires in electric motors and generators. He found that combining phenol (C6H5OH) and formaldehyde (HCOH) formed a sticky mass and later found that the material could be mixed with wood flour, <b>asbestos,</b> or <b>slate</b> dust to create strong and fire resistant [...] "composite" [...] materials. The new material tended to foam during synthesis, requiring that Baekeland build pressure vessels to force out the bubbles and provide a smooth, uniform product, as he announced in 1909, in {{a meeting of the}} American Chemical Society. Bakelite was originally used for electrical and mechanical parts, coming into widespread use in consumer goods and jewelry in the 1920s. [...] Bakelite was a purely synthetic material, not derived from living matter. It was also an early thermosetting plastic.|$|R
40|$|When {{asbestos}} containing materials (ACM) must {{be removed}} from the building before demolition, additional greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are generated. However, precedent studies have not considered the removal of ACM from the building. The present study aimed to develop a model for estimating GHG emissions created by the ACM removal processes, specifically the removal of <b>asbestos</b> cement <b>slates</b> (ACS). The second objective was to use the new model to predict the total GHG emission produced by ACM removal in the entire country of Korea. First, an input-equipment inventory was established for each step of the ACS removal process. Second, an energy consumption database for each equipment type was established. Third, the total GHG emission contributed by each step of the process was calculated. The GHG emissions generated from the 1, 142, 688 ACS-containing buildings in Korea was estimated to total 23, 778 tonCO 2 eq to 132, 141 tonCO 2 eq. This study was meaningful in that the emissions generated by ACS removal have not been studied before. Furthermore, the study deals with additional problems that can be triggered by the presence of asbestos in building materials. The method provided in this study is expected to contribute greatly to the calculation of GHG emissions caused by ACM worldwide...|$|R

Annotated and edited A 4 transcript of a Witness Seminar held on 23 March 1999, with extracts from a Witness Seminar on the MRC Pneumoconious Unit held on 9 November 1994. Introduction by Professor George Davey Smith. Population-based research in south Wales was initially to investigate occupational lung disease in miners. Archie Cochrane, the renowned epidemiologist, and his clinical and environmental studies group at the Pneumoconiosis Research Unit at Llandough Hospital, Cardiff, conducted respiratory and blood pressure surveys of workers in the Welsh valleys. In 1960 the epidemiological studies were separated from pneumoconiosis research and detailed studies began in the new Epidemiological Research Unit (South Wales) in Cardiff on glaucoma, dust diseases in flax, <b>asbestos,</b> steel and <b>slate</b> workers, with later work on iron deficiency anaemia, environmental lead, migraine, asthma, and two high-profile trials showing improved survival following a heart attack with regular use of aspirin and with consumption of a diet rich in oily fish. Statisticians and field workers made important contributions to both randomized controlled trials and observational studies at the unit over five decades. Selections from archived interviews with former members of both units appear {{as well as a}} section on the impact on data analysis from steadily increasing computational capacity.
