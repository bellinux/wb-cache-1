5|$|Even {{prior to}} the cost {{increases}} which plagued the design and construction of the tram, the project has been subject to criticism from the public. Many residents in the neighborhoods under the tram's route object to the tram's presence. The cost increases themselves, and the perceived machinations of public officials, have been controversial. Some consider the project an unworthy use of public funds <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>price,</b> either {{due to a lack}} of benefit for those not associated with OHSU, or due to opposition to such projects in general.|$|E
5|$|Turner's {{painting}} achieved widespread critical acclaim, and accolades {{from the}} likes of John Ruskin and William Makepeace Thackeray. It was Turner's particular favourite; he only lent it once and refused to ever do so again. He also refused to sell it <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>price,</b> and on his death bequeathed it to the nation. It hangs today in the National Gallery, and in 2005 it was voted the nation's favourite painting in a poll organized by BBC Radio 4's Today programme.|$|E
5|$|By {{this stage}} McCudden was {{suffering}} from combat fatigue. It manifested itself in his decisions, of late, to seek a victory <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>price,</b> which was alien to his normal, calculated approach to combat. Knowing he was to soon be sent home, he was obsessed with catching up to von Richthofen's score. His contribution to 56 Squadron at this time was impressive; the unit had claimed 175 enemy aircraft while reporting 14 pilots killed and missing and seven captured. As Flight Commander, B Flight, McCudden's pilots had shot down 77–52 of which were his—while losing four pilots. To celebrate his success he dined with Brigadier General John Higgins and the following evening was invited to the headquarters of General Julian Byng, General Officer Commanding the British Third Army, to be personally congratulated.|$|E

2500|$|<b>At</b> <b>any</b> given <b>price,</b> a {{prospective}} buyer has some marginal rate of substitution {{of money for}} the good or service in question. [...] Given the [...] "law" [...] of diminishing marginal utility, or otherwise given convex indifference curves, the rates are such that the willingness to forgo money for the good or service decreases as the buyer would have ever more of the good or service and ever less money. [...] Hence, any given buyer has a demand schedule that generally decreases in response to price (at least until quantity demanded reaches zero). [...] The aggregate quantity demanded by all buyers is, <b>at</b> <b>any</b> given <b>price,</b> just the sum of the quantities demanded by individual buyers, so it too decreases as price increases.|$|R

Both of these films received mixed reviews from critics.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{literature}} has pointed to difficulties {{in these kinds of}} assumptions. For instance, there may be aversion <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>price</b> towards losing particular species. It has also been suggested that low-probability, extreme outcomes are overweighted when making choices. This is related to climate change, since the possibility of future abrupt changes in the climate or the Earth system cannot be ruled out. For example, if the West Antarctic ice sheet was to disintegrate, it could result in a sea level rise of 4–6meters over several centuries.|$|E

Those who command the condition of Sydney Cricket Ground and its accessories gave him just the pitch he needed. By this time, I fancy, they were nauseated by negation and demanded a win <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>price</b> – even at the price of Australian defeat.|$|E

25|$|Giorgione died, {{probably}} of {{the plague}} then raging, by October, 1510.

October 1510 is also the date of a letter by Isabella d'Este to a Venetian friend; asking him to buy a painting by Giorgione; the letter shows she was aware he was already dead.

25|$|Despite the {{building}} boom, {{there was only}} one trader in the area in the summer of '71, a man named Elmore who was stationed at Omineca City. Elmore made a small fortune selling supplies to the miners. Food prices were very high and some items, like picks and shovels weren't available <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>price.</b> Because of this high cost of living and the difficulty in procuring the necessary supplies, many miners left the area. Of those who stayed it is reported that some did vey well. One report claimed that 500 ounces a week was being taken from Germansen Creek alone. Again, these numbers may have been much higher, and very little was ever recorded on the Chinese miners, where they worked, or how they fared in their mining endeavours.|$|E

50|$|Excess {{supply in}} one market can affect supply or demand in another market. For example, {{when there is}} excess supply {{in the labor market}} - that is, {{unemployment}} - consumer-laborers will be constrained in their disposable income and hence will demand a smaller quantity of goods <b>at</b> <b>any</b> given <b>price.</b> This diminished goods demand resulting from a constraint in another market is known as the effective demand for goods.|$|R
50|$|An {{attempt by}} Sussex to {{increase}} the enmity of the O'Donnells against the O'Neill was frustrated by his seizure of Calvagh O'Donnell in a monastery.

The demand curve for all consumers together follows from the demand curve of every individual consumer: the individual demands at each price are added together, assuming independent decision-making.|$|R
