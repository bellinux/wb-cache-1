5|$|There {{are dozens}} of other {{chemical}} neurotransmitters {{that are used in}} more limited areas of the brain, often areas dedicated to a particular function. Serotonin, for example—the primary target of antidepressant drugs and many dietary aids—comes exclusively from a small brainstem <b>area</b> <b>called</b> the raphe nuclei. Norepinephrine, which is involved in arousal, comes exclusively from a nearby small <b>area</b> <b>called</b> the locus coeruleus. Other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine have multiple sources in the brain, but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and GABA.|$|E

5|$|Dynamic {{balance is}} {{provided}} through the three semicircular canals. These three canals are orthogonal (at right angles) to each other. At {{the end of}} each canal is a slight enlargement, known as the ampulla, which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central <b>area</b> <b>called</b> the cupula. The fluid in these canals rotates according to the momentum of the head. When a person changes acceleration, the inertia of the fluid changes. This affects the pressure on the cupula, and results in the opening of ion channels. This causes depolarisation, which is passed as a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve. Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the vestibulo–ocular reflex.|$|E
5|$|Herne Bay Junior School, {{situated}} in the town centre, has about 500 students. It was originally established in the late Victorian era and was formerly joined with the neighbouring Herne Bay Infant school. In 2006, Herne Bay Junior School's Key Stage 2 results ranked 139th out of Kent's 386 state primary schools. There is one smaller primary school in the <b>area</b> <b>called</b> Grosvenor House, which is a school for pupils permanently excluded from mainstream schooling.|$|E
5|$|Much later, during World War I in 1916, a {{standardized}} and diluted modification of Labarraque's solution containing hypochlorite (0.5%) and boric acid as an acidic stabilizer, {{was developed by}} Henry Drysdale Dakin (who gave full credit to Labarraque's prior work in this <b>area).</b> <b>Called</b> Dakin's solution, the method of wound irrigation with chlorinated solutions allowed antiseptic treatment {{of a wide variety}} of open wounds, long before the modern antibiotic era. A modified version of this solution continues to be employed in wound irrigation in modern times, where it remains effective against bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics (see Century Pharmaceuticals).|$|E

5|$|Nigersaurus {{is known}} from the Elrhaz Formation of the Tegama Group in an <b>area</b> <b>called</b> Gadoufaoua, located in Niger. It {{is one of the}} most {{commonly}} found vertebrates in the formation. The Elrhaz Formation consists mainly of fluvial sandstones with low relief, much of which is obscured by sand dunes. The sediments are coarse- to medium-grained, with almost no fine-grained horizons. Nigersaurus lived in what is now Niger about 115 to 105 million years ago, during the Aptian and Albian ages of the mid-Cretaceous. It likely lived in habitats dominated by inland floodplains (a riparian zone).|$|E
5|$|Plutonium milling {{operations}} produced {{large quantities}} of toxic cutting fluid contaminated with particles of plutonium and uranium. Thousands of 55-gallon drums of the waste were stored outside in an unprotected earthen <b>area</b> <b>called</b> the 903 pad storage area, where they corroded and leaked radionuclides over years into the soil and water. An estimated 5,000 gallons of plutonium-contaminated oil leached into the soil between 1964 and 1967. Portions of this waste, mixed with dust that composed Pad 903, became airborne in the heavy winds of the Front Range and contaminated offsite areas {{to the south and}} east.|$|E
5|$|The bayside {{residential}} <b>area</b> <b>called</b> La Playa lies somewhat {{north of}} the original La Playa, the beach where commercial and military ships anchored during {{the early days of}} the city. La Playa includes some of the most expensive homes in San Diego. Some bayfront homes have private piers for small boats. The hills above La Playa are known as the Wooded Area on the bay side of Catalina Boulevard (so called because of the many mature trees in the area), and the College Area on the ocean side (because of the proximity of Point Loma Nazarene College). The Sunset Cliffs neighborhood is on the west side, above ocean bluffs, and is known for its views of the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

5|$|The former Eastern Region {{was once}} famed for {{producing}} half the world's total output of palm kernels.

The production of other important cash crops such as cocoa, groundnut and groundnut oil, rubber, cassava, cotton and cotton seed and timber tumbled {{after the civil war}} and the subsequent oil boom years. Consequently, the <b>area</b> <b>called</b> Enugu State as well as the rest of Nigeria, which was once a self-sufficient net exporter in agricultural produce, must import food.|$|E

5|$|The {{park has}} several areas {{reserved}} for {{small and large}} groups. Four field-level suites, each with 33exterior seats and additional interior space to accommodate 22people, are located directly behind home plate.

Two covered party decks are located on the second level—one at each end—both of which can accommodate up to 75people each. Between {{the end of the}} lower seating bowl in left field and the outfield berm lies a group area which can accommodate up to 600individuals. This area consists of a covered picnic area, round picnic tables, rearrangeable chairs, and stadium seats.

5|$|Tin Pan Alley was an <b>area</b> <b>called</b> Union Square in New York City, {{which became}} the major center for music {{publishing}} by the mid-1890s. The songwriters of this era wrote formulaic songs, many of them sentimental ballads. During this era, a sense of national consciousness was developing, as the United States became a formidable world power, especially after the Spanish–American War. The increased availability and efficiency of railroads and the postal service helped disseminate ideas, including popular songs.|$|E
5|$|A {{dense fog}} helped to cloud {{the advance of}} St. Hilaire's French division, but as they went up the slope the legendary 'Sun of Austerlitz' ripped the mist apart and {{encouraged}} them forward. Russian soldiers and commanders {{on top of the}} heights were stunned to see so many French troops coming towards them. Allied commanders moved some of the delayed detachments of the fourth column into this bitter struggle. Over an hour of fighting destroyed much of this unit. The other men from the second column, mostly inexperienced Austrians, also participated in the struggle and swung the numbers against one of the best fighting forces in the French army, eventually forcing them to withdraw down the slopes. However, gripped by desperation, St. Hilaire's men struck hard once more and bayoneted the Allies out of the heights. To the north, General Vandamme's division attacked an <b>area</b> <b>called</b> Staré Vinohrady ("Old Vineyards") and, through talented skirmishing and deadly volleys, broke several Allied battalions.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1904 {{he built}} the Chalet de Catllaràs, in La Pobla de Lillet, for the Asland cement factory, owned by Eusebi Güell. It has a simple {{structure}} though very original, {{in the shape}} of a pointed arch, with two semi-circular flights of stairs leading to the top two floors. This building fell into ruin when the cement works closed, and when it was eventually restored its appearance was radically altered, the ingenious original staircase being replaced with a simpler metal one. In the same area he created the Can Artigas Gardens between 1905 and 1907, in an <b>area</b> <b>called</b> Font de la Magnesia, commissioned by the textile merchant Joan Artigas i Alart; men who had worked the Park Güell were also involved on this project, similar to the famous park in Barcelona.|$|E
