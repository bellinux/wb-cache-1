40|$|The Louisiana (LA) shelf is chronically {{affected}} by seasonal hypoxia {{that has been}} shown to be spatially expanding and growing progressively more severe. Hypoxic conditions on the shelf have been closely linked to the large quantities of nutrients delivered to the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River. Multiple geochemical proxies on a suite of sediment cores from the LA shelf provide a record of environmental change that parallels the onset of hypoxic conditions over the last century and prior to anthropogenic influences. The sedimentary record for the last century shows a shift from terrestrial to algal sources to the sediments, as well as a trend of increasingly enriched nitrogen isotopes, which is probably caused by a combination of large amounts of denitrification, either within the Mississippi watershed or on the continental shelf, increased primary productivity, compounded with relatively minor increases of enriched nitrogen source inputs. The current chronic hypoxia, especially since the early 19702 ̆ 7 s, is exacerbated by anthropogenic nutrient loading from the Mississippi River basin, but other processes must be responsible in the past. In the historic record, several episodic low-oxygen events are defined by forminiferal assemblages and shifts in the geochemical records. Geochemistry of three sediment cores from the Louisiana (LA) shelf indicates that these historic events are likely caused by increased inputs of terrestrially-derived organic matter during peaks in Mississippi River discharge. These results suggest that low-oxygen conditions may be a natural, <b>aperiodic</b> <b>phenomenon</b> on the LA shelf, and that the current seasonally severe hypoxia resulted from the excess anthropogenic nutrient input...|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} summary of observed dynamic phenomena associated with sunspots is presented, {{together with a}} description of the observational techniques and available analytical formulations for the processes under study. The phenomena detected thus far are grouped into aperiodic events and oscillations and waves. <b>Aperiodic</b> <b>phenomena</b> comprise umbral flares, the superpenumbra, and inverse Evershed flow. Internal, aperiodic manifestations include penumbral grains, the photospheric penumbral dark fibrils, Evershed flow, umbral dots, the inhomogeneity of the umbral magnetic field, and umbral turbulence. Oscillations and flashes are seen in the umbra, while running waves and dark puffs have been detected in the penumbra, and oscillations are located in the photosphere. All the observed features are evidence of mass motion and change on time scales of less than an hour...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{nonlinear}} {{dynamics and}} stability of a rotating system with an electromagnetic noncontact damper are investigated. The rotating system model includes a cubic restoring force representing nonlinear behavior of shaft supports at the boundaries. Analysis of the rotor equilibrium state reveals that the system becomes unstable via a Hopf bifurcation when reaching a specific supercritical angular velocity. A closed-form solution for the radius of the limit cycle {{and the frequency of}} the self-excited oscillation are obtained. Forced vibration induced by the rotating system unbalance is investigated by a numerical simulation. System response includes periodic and quasi-periodic solutions. Analysis of the nonlinear rotating system enables a possible explanation of the <b>aperiodic</b> <b>phenomena</b> documented for rotors controlled by an electromagnetic eddy-current damper in high-speed operation...|$|R
5000|$|Flinders {{coined the}} term [...] "dodge tide" [...] in {{reference}} to his 1802/3 observations that the tides in the very shallow Spencer and St Vincent's Gulfs seemed to be completely inert for several days, at select locations. Such phenomena have now also {{been found in the}} Gulf of Mexico and in the Irish Sea. Taylor noticed that the apparent amphidromic points in the Irish Sea to be ephemeral, contrary to Laplace's theory. He also noted that the current shears often exceeded the Reynolds stability limit. Taylor and later workers determined these <b>aperiodic</b> <b>phenomena</b> to be a consequence of the Irish Sea being shallow and can be comparable to the thickness of the bottom boundary layer. In both the Irish Sea and the two South Australian gulfs, a north bound wave from the open ocean interferes non-linearly and with a reflected and weaker southbound wave, resulting in aperiodc and very dissipative tidal motions. The total dissipation of these two very large gulfs has not yet been calculated. The shallow Bering Sea dissipates some 50% of global input power. These ocean dissipative hot spots are alone capable of preventing the Gerstenkorn catastrophe of seas turned to steam and highly elliptical planetary orbits, by providing a rapid and non-geological energy sink.|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} of millisecond neutron star spin periods in LMXBs {{has been discussed}} in earnest since the recycling scenario {{for the formation of}} millisecond radio pulsars was first proposed in the early 1980 's. A beat frequency interpretation of the then newly discovered low-frequency QPOs in Z sources involving millisecond spins was proposed in 1985. After the discovery of the kHz QPOs in LMXBs with RXTE in 1996, the {{possibility of}} a link with the neutron star spin has been discussed extensively again. The discoveries of the accreting millisecond pulsars from 1998 onward and of kHz QPOs in several of these from 2003 gave further impetus to the debate about to what extent <b>aperiodic</b> <b>phenomena</b> in LMXBs have a direct link with the spin. I review the current status of this discussion. Beat frequency models that were originally proposed for the kHz QPOs are no longer viable. If a relation of the QPO frequencies with the spin exists, then this requires a rather specific, presumably resonant, interaction of the spin with the accretion flow forcing matter to move in step with the spin somewhere in the flow. The evidence for a link of the kHz QPOs with neutron star spin has not over the years become more convincing despite much more data, yet connections do seem to exist. I suggest that this provides a hint as to how the kHz and other QPO frequencies arise and what is the optimal approach to satisfactorily describing them as a physical phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of the thermoelectric lamellar misfit cobalt oxide [Bi 0. 84 CaO 2] 2 [CoO 2] 1. 69 has been refined using single crystal X-ray diffraction data. Using the four dimensional superspace formalism for aperiodic structures, the superspace group is confirmed P 2 /m(0 δ 1 / 2) (a 1 = 4. 9069 (4), b 1 = 4. 7135 (7), b 2 = 2. 8256 (4), c 1 = 14. 668 (5) Å, β 1 = 93. 32 (1) °). The modulated displacements and site occupancies have been refined and are both compatible with the misfit character of the structure, and with a longitudinal modulation of the Bi-O layers of the structure. This modulation {{is similar to the}} corresponding one in the related Sr phase [Bi 0. 87 SrO 2] 2 [CoO 2] 1. 82, but now oriented in the orthogonal direction. Because its incommensurate wavelength is locked with the aperiodicity of the misfit structure, it is possible to distinguish between the modulation parameters induced by the accommodation of both subsystems and those related to the longitudinal modulation of the Bi-O layers. In this original structure, two independent <b>aperiodic</b> <b>phenomena</b> coexist in an single crystallographic direction. A particular {{attention has been paid to}} the structural configuration of the CoO 2 layer, in relation with other similar phases. The thermoelectric properties are probably directly related to the specific distortion of the compressed layer, but the different measured values for the Seebeck coefficient cannot be related to a significant modification of the CoO 6 octahedra. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

40|$|We {{study the}} surface shape {{of water in}} an open {{cylinder}} driven by constant rotation of the bottom. Around the critical Reynolds number for the laminar-turbulent transition, the surface deformation, which is {{of the order of}} the container size, shows an <b>aperiodic</b> switching <b>phenomenon</b> between an axisymmetric shape and a nonaxisymmetric shape. The axisymmetric shape is observed as a steady state when the Reynolds number is smaller than that in the switching region, while the nonaxisymmetric shape is observed as a (quasi-) periodic state in which the surface rotates at almost constant angular velocity when the Reynolds number is larger than that in the switching region. A detailed analysis for the surface shape suggests that the flow with the nonaxisymmetric shape is turbulent. © 2006 American Institute of Physic...|$|R

40|$|Self-assembled monolayers of sulfur-containing heterocycles and linear {{oligomers}} containing thiophene {{groups have}} been widely employed in organic electronic applications. Here, we investigate the dynamics of isolated thiophene molecules on Cu(111) by combining helium spin-echo (HeSE) spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations. We show that the thiophene/Cu(111) system displays a rich array of <b>aperiodic</b> dynamical <b>phenomena</b> that include jump diffusion between adjacent atop sites over a 59 – 62 meV barrier and activated rotation around a sulfur–copper anchor, two processes that have been observed previously for related systems. In addition, we present experimental evidence for a new, weakly activated process, the flapping of the molecular ring. Repulsive inter-adsorbate interactions and an exceptionally high friction coefficient of 5 ± 2 ps– 1 are also observed. These experiments demonstrate the versatility of the HeSE technique, and the quantitative information extracted in a detailed analysis provides an ideal benchmark for state-of-the-art theoretical techniques including nonlocal adsorbate–substrate interactions...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 This thesis {{discusses}} {{the design and}} evaluation of an instrument that can estimate the probability density distributions of bandlimited, <b>aperiodic</b> electrical <b>phenomena.</b> This estimator can obtain the probability density estimates of signals that are contained within the frequency range of 100 cps. to 20 kcs. However, the basic design logic of the instrument {{can serve as a}} design foundation for a device that should be capable of estimating the distributions of signals that range in frequency from a fraction of a cycle to 50 kcs. Transistors and solid-state diodes are used in the instrument's circuitry. This device, however, is not a transistorized version of another instrument. Area error, form factor, and end-point error evaluation techniques are discussed, modified and then combined to develop a procedure which will determine an instrument's frequency-dependency characteristics. The author also introduces an evaluation technique (the pseudo impulse test) that involves the use of a test sgna 1 that has a theoretical probability density distribution which contains a series of impulse functions. The pseudo impulse test is a powerful technique whir. h will reveal the operating capahllitie 9 of an instrument. All the evaluation techniques discussed here may be used to evaluate any device that is designed to estimate probability density distributions.

40|$|Context: [abbreviated] Aims: Kepler data {{of three}} known Be stars are re-visited to {{establish}} their pulsational nature and assess the properties of additional, non-pulsational variations. The three program stars {{turned out to be}} one inactive Be star, one active, continuously outbursting Be star, and one Be star transiting from a non-outbursting into an outbursting phase, thus forming an excellent sample to distill properties of Be stars in the various phases of their life-cycle. Methods: [abbreviated] Results: The short-term photometric variability of Be stars must be disentangled into a stellar and a circumstellar part. The stellar part is on the whole not different from what is seen in non-Be stars. However, some of the observed phenomena might be to be due to resonant mode coupling, a mechanism not typically considered for B-type stars. Short-term circumstellar variability comes in the form of either a group of relatively well-defined, short-lived frequencies during outbursts, which are called Štefl frequencies, and broad bumps in the power spectra, indicating aperiodic variability on a time scale similar to typical low-order g-mode pulsation frequencies, rather than true periodicity. Conclusions: From a stellar pulsation perspective, Be stars are rapidly rotating SPB stars, that is they pulsate in low order g-modes, even if the rapid rotation can project the observed frequencies into the traditional high-order p-mode regime above about 4 c/d. However, when a circumstellar disk is present, Be star power spectra are complicated by both cyclic, or periodic, and <b>aperiodic</b> circumstellar <b>phenomena,</b> possibly even dominating the power spectrum.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{aperiodic}} variability of the 401 Hz accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J 1808. 4 − 3658 using the complete data set collected with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer over 14 years of observation. The source shows a number of exceptional <b>aperiodic</b> timing <b>phenomena</b> that are observed {{against a backdrop of}} timing properties that show consistent trends in all five observed outbursts and closely resemble those of other atoll sources. We performed a detailed study of the enigmatic ~ 410 Hz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO), which has only been observed in SAX J 1808. 4 − 3658. We find that it appears only when the upper kHz QPO frequency is less than the 401 Hz spin frequency. The difference between the ~ 410 Hz QPO frequency and the spin frequency follows a similar frequency correlation as the low frequency power spectral components, suggesting that the ~ 410 Hz QPO is a retrograde beat against the spin frequency of a rotational phenomenon in the 9 Hz range. Comparing this 9 Hz beat feature with the low-frequency QPO in SAX J 1808. 4 − 3658 and other neutron star sources, we conclude that these two might be part of the same basic phenomenon. We suggest that they might be caused by retrograde precession due to a combination of relativistic, classical and magnetic torques. Additionally we present two new measurements of the lower kHz QPO, allowing us, for the first time, to measure the frequency evolution of the twin kHz QPOs in this source. The twin kHz QPOs are seen to move together over 150 Hz, maintaining a centroid frequency separation of (0. 446 ± 0. 009) spi...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Complex {{nonlinear}} {{and chaotic}} responses have been recently observed in various compliant ocean systems. These systems {{are characterized by}} a nonlinear mooring restoring force and a coupled fluid-structure interaction exciting force. A general class of ocean mooring system models is formulated by incorporating a variable mooring configuration and the exact form of the hydrodynamic excitation. The multi-degree of freedom system, subjected to combined parametric and external excitation, is shown to be complex, coupled and strongly nonlinear. Stability analysis by a Liapunov function approach reveals global system attraction which ensures that solutions remain bounded for small excitation. Construction of the system's Poincare map and stability analysis of the map's fixed points correspond to system stability of near resonance periodic orbits. Investigation of nonresonant solutions is done by a local variational approach. Tangent and period doubling bifurcations are identified by both local stability analysis techniques and are further investigated to reveal global bifurcations. Application of Melnikov's method to the perturbed averaged system provides an approximate criterion {{for the existence of}} transverse homoclinic orbits resulting in chaotic system dynamics. Further stability analysis of the subharmonic and ultraharmonic solutions reveals a cascade of period doubling which is shown to evolve to a strange attractor. Investigation of the bifurcation criteria obtained reveals a steady state superstructure in the bifurcation set. This superstructure identifies a similar bifurcation pattern of coexisting solutions in the sub, ultra and ultrasubharmonic domains. Within this structure strange attractors appear when a period doubling sequence is infinite and when abrupt changes in the size of an attractor occur near tangent bifurcations. Parametric analysis of system instabilities reveals the influence of the convective inertial force which can not be neglected for large response and the bias induced by the quadratic viscous drag is found to be a controlling mechanism even for moderate sea states. Thus, stability analyses of a nonlinear ocean mooring system by semi-analytical methods reveal the existence of bifurcations identifying complex periodic and <b>aperiodic</b> nonlinear <b>phenomena.</b> The results obtained apply to a variety of nonlinear ocean mooring and towing system configurations. Extensions and applications of this research are discussed...|$|R
