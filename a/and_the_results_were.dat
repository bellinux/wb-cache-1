5|$|A SMS {{opinion poll}} of 2,123 people was {{conducted}} by Roy Morgan Research over the 26 January 2015 Australia Day weekend <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> broadcast on ABC's Triple J radio network. The poll revealed that 52 per cent of people agreed that Australians convicted of drug trafficking in another country {{and sentenced to death}} should be executed. Muhammad Prasetyo, Indonesia's attorney general, was reported as saying that there was strong support in Australia for the death penalty.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} other insects, P.exclamans use sexual pheromones to attract members of the {{opposite}} sex. Researchers have attempted to determine the exact role that sexual pheromones play in sexual attraction in paper wasps. They set up a wind tunnel where males and females were exposed to a sexual pheromone wick that was isolated from males and females. These pheromones were taken by hexane extracts from wholes bodies and thoraces of unmated females. The male extracts {{were taken from the}} ectal mandibular and seventh sternal glands. It was found that the opposite sex was attracted upwind of the scent <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> intensified when a fan was turned on. The range of the scent was found to be around 2 metres.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of {{the identities of the}} men who served on the Mary Rose, even {{when it comes to the}} names of the officers, who would have belonged to the gentry. Two admirals and four captains (including Edward and Thomas Howard, who served both positions) are known through records, as well as a few ship masters, pursers, master gunners and other specialists. Forensic science has been used by artists to create reconstructions of faces of eight crew members, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> publicized in May 2013. In addition, {{researchers}} have extracted DNA from remains in the hopes of identifying origins of crew, and potentially living descendants.|$|E
5|$|The {{cannibalism}} of {{the frog}} {{has been speculated}} to cause its decline in some areas, because the smaller tadpoles can be toxic. Other postulated causes of the decline include increased ultraviolet radiation due to {{the hole in the}} ozone layer, global warming, and increased drought. The first theory was tested <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> inconclusive. Global warming is not thought to be a credible cause, as the extremities of the frog's range have not changed, while declines in population have occurred in both dry and wetter areas.|$|E
5|$|The event {{featured}} five matches {{based on}} scripted storylines, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> predetermined by the WWF. The main event was the 1995 Royal Rumble match, which Shawn Michaels won after entering first and outlasting the 29 other wrestlers {{for the first}} time in WWF history. The event also featured a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, when Diesel defended the title against Bret Hart. The match was stopped when several other wrestlers interfered and the referee lost control of the match. Two other title matches took place; Jeff Jarrett won the WWF Intercontinental Championship from Razor Ramon, and The 1–2–3 Kid and Bob Holly won the final match in a tournament that determined the new WWF Tag Team Champions.|$|E

5|$|The paper {{used for}} the Grolier Codex appears to be {{authentic}} pre-Columbian bark paper dating from the 13th century. A number of non-destructive techniques have been applied to the codex {{in an effort to}} authenticate it, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> published in 2008. The analysis revealed that only pre-Columbian materials had been used in its creation; no modern inorganic materials were detected. Some inconsistencies were revealed however; cuts along the page edges seem to have been made with a sharp blade in order to give the appearance of natural wear and tear and the supposed water staining did not permeate the paper. The researchers commented that the staining appeared {{to be the result of}} drops of dye or ink being applied to the surface of the codex. In conclusion the researchers were unable to support or refute the pre-Columbian nature of the codex. Unusually for a document that supposedly was stored in a cave for centuries, the paint of the codex still appears fresh.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli {{accepted}} Philip's invitation fully {{believing that}} {{he would be able to}} convince Luther. By contrast, Luther did not expect anything to come out of the meeting and had to be urged by Philip to attend. Zwingli, accompanied by Oecolampadius, arrived on 28 September 1529 with Luther and Philipp Melanchthon arriving shortly thereafter. Other theologians also participated including Martin Bucer, Andreas Osiander, Johannes Brenz, and Justus Jonas. The debates were held from 1–3 October <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>were</b> published in the fifteen Marburg Articles. The participants were able to agree on fourteen of the articles, but the fifteenth article established the differences in their views on the presence of Christ in the eucharist. Afterwards, each side was convinced that they were the victors, but in fact the controversy was not resolved and the final result was the formation of two different Protestant confessions.|$|E
