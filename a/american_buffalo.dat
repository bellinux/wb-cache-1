5|$|Despite {{attempts}} by the Mint to adjust the design, the coins proved to strike indistinctly, and {{to be subject to}} wear—the dates were easily worn away in circulation. In 1938, after the expiration of the minimum 25-year period during which the design could not be replaced without congressional authorization, it was replaced by the Jefferson nickel, designed by Felix Schlag. Fraser's design is admired today, and has been used on commemorative coins and the gold <b>American</b> <b>Buffalo</b> series.|$|E

Pacino continued performing onstage in the 1970s, winning a second Tony Award for The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel and performing the title role in Richard III. In the 1980s, Pacino again achieved critical success on stage while appearing in David Mamet's <b>American</b> <b>Buffalo,</b> for which Pacino {{was nominated for a}} Drama Desk Award.

25|$|The coin {{was created}} in order to compete with foreign 24-karat gold bullion coins. Since investors {{sometimes}} prefer 99.99% pure gold over the 91.67% gold used in the American Gold Eagle, many were choosing non-U.S. coins, such as the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf, to meet their bullion needs. With the <b>American</b> <b>Buffalo</b> coin, the U.S. government hopes {{to increase the amount}} of U.S. gold sales and cash in on the 24-karat sales, which makes up about 60% of the world gold market.|$|E

25|$|Twentieth-Century Fox brought Allen {{in for a}} rewrite {{when they}} were unhappy with the script that David Mamet had {{produced}} from Barry Reed's novel The Verdict, thinking he had deviated too much from the original material. She produced a script they were happy with, but then handed it to Robert Redford, who began to tinker it to fit his persona. Eventually the producers took it away from Redford and offered it to Lumet, who had just seen a production of Mamet's, <b>American</b> <b>Buffalo</b> with Al Pacino, and preferred to use Mamet's original script. In the end the studio had paid both Allen and Redford and ended up with Mamet's original script anyway.|$|E
25|$|The <b>American</b> <b>Buffalo,</b> {{also known}} as a gold buffalo, is a 24-karat bullion coin first offered for sale by the United States Mint on June 22, 2006, and {{available}} for shipment beginning on July 13. The coin follows the design of the Indian Head nickel and has gained its nickname from the American Bison on the reverse side of the design. This was the first time ever that the United States Government has minted pure (.9999) 24-karat gold coins for the public. The coin has a legal tender (face) value of US$50. Due to a combination of the coin's popularity and the tremendous increase in the price of gold since its creation the coin's value has increased considerably in a short time of just a few years. The initial 2006 U.S. Mint price of the proof coin was $800. In 2007 the Mint proof coin was $899.95, $1,410.00 in 2009, and $2,010.00 in 2011.|$|E
