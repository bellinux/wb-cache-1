5|$|Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne {{tropical}} disease {{caused by the}} dengue virus. Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash. Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.|$|E

5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP), {{also known}} as IgA vasculitis, anaphylactoid purpura, purpura rheumatica, and Schönlein–Henoch purpura, is a disease of the skin, mucous membranes, and {{sometimes}} other organs that most commonly affects children. In the skin, the disease causes palpable purpura (small, raised areas of bleeding underneath the skin), often with joint pain and abdominal pain. With kidney involvement, {{there may be a}} loss of small amounts of blood and protein in the urine (hematuria and proteinuria), but this usually goes unnoticed; in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> cases, the kidney involvement proceeds to chronic kidney disease. HSP is often preceded by an infection, such as a throat infection.|$|E
5|$|In {{assessing}} peacefulness, the GPI {{investigates the}} extent to which countries are involved in ongoing domestic and international conflicts. It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might be described as a safety and security in society.

5|$|Maya art is {{essentially}} {{the art of the}} royal court. It is almost exclusively concerned with the Maya elite and their world. Maya art was crafted from both perishable and non-perishable materials, and served to link the Maya to their ancestors.

Maya art has many regional styles, and is unique in the ancient Americas in bearing narrative text. The finest surviving Maya art dates to the Late Classic period.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{copper alloys}} have been formulated, many with {{important}} uses. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. Bronze usually refers to copper-tin alloys, but {{can refer to}} any alloy of copper such as aluminium bronze. Copper {{is one of the}} most important constituents of silver and carat gold and carat solders used in the jewelry industry, modifying the color, hardness and melting point of the resulting alloys.

5|$|Prevention {{of malaria}} {{may be more}} {{cost-effective}} than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the initial costs required are {{out of reach of}} many of the world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the Chinese provinces—the required investment is <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar program in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.|$|E

5|$|The size of Chnodomar's cavalry is unknown, but was {{probably}} <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> the total, as the Alamanni's heavily forested land was not suited to large-scale cavalry operations. Most of the Alamanni horsemen were noblemen and their retainers, as only {{they could afford}} to keep a warhorse. Chnodomar's cavalry is unlikely to have exceeded 1,750 horse in total, assuming that the cavalry element was similar to the 7% cavalry element in the early Roman citizen legion, as the latter was also recruited exclusively from the wealthiest classes.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of hepatic encephalopathy {{depends on the}} suspected underlying cause (types A, B or C) and {{the presence or absence}} of underlying causes. If encephalopathy develops in acute liver failure (type A), even in a mild form (grade 1–2), it indicates that a liver transplant may be required, and transfer to a specialist centre is advised. Hepatic encephalopathy type B may arise in those who have undergone a TIPS procedure; in most cases this resolves spontaneously or with the medical treatments discussed below, but in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> about5%, occlusion of the shunt is required to address the symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture in Wales has in {{the past}} been {{a major part of the}} economy of Wales, a largely rural country that forms part of the United Kingdom. Wales is mountainous and has a mild, wet climate. This results in only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> the land area being {{suitable}} for arable cropping, but grass for the grazing of livestock is present in abundance. As a proportion of the national economy, the importance of agriculture has become much reduced; a high proportion of the population now live in the towns and cities in the south of the country and tourism has become an important form of income in the countryside and on the coast. Arable cropping is limited to the flatter parts and elsewhere dairying and livestock farming predominate.|$|E
