25|$|Opponents of VSU {{note that}} not all {{economic}} benefits are maximised individually (i.e., there are beneficial externalities). For example, student unions have frequently subsidised food outlets on campus, arguing that people get utility from bars crowded with fun-seeking university students – an environment that might {{not exist in the}} absence of subsidy. Proponents respond that students who don't make use of the crowded outlet <b>are</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> others' food and drink. Another more serious example relates to advocacy provided by students associations. Many students face difficult personal and financial problems whilst studying. Advocacy services are not used by 100% of students, yet all students pay for the service to be available. Some students argue that they <b>are</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> other students to use the advocacy service even though they have not needed to use it.|$|E
25|$|Most service {{stations}} allow the customer to pump the fuel before paying; {{this is particularly}} {{the case in the}} smaller towns and cities in New Zealand. In recent years some {{service stations}} have required customers to purchase their fuel first. It is quite common for customers to hand the cash to the attendant on the forecourt if they <b>are</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> a set amount of fuel and have no change. Some supermarkets have their own forecourts which are unmanned and payment is pay at the pump only. Customers at the supermarket will receive a discount voucher which offers discounted fuel at their forecourt. The amount of discount varies depending on the amount spent on groceries at the supermarket, but normally starts at 4 cents a liter.|$|E
25|$|Raising {{the price}} of carbon will achieve four goals. First, it will provide signals to {{consumers}} about what goods and services are high-carbon ones and should therefore be used more sparingly. Second, it will provide signals to producers about which inputs use more carbon (such as coal and oil) and which use less or none (such as natural gas or nuclear power), thereby inducing firms to substitute low-carbon inputs. Third, it will give market incentives for inventors and innovators to develop and introduce low-carbon products and processes that can replace {{the current generation of}} technologies. Fourth, and most important, a high carbon price will economize on the information that is required to do all three of these tasks. Through the market mechanism, a high carbon price will raise {{the price of}} products according to their carbon content. Ethical consumers today, hoping to minimize their “carbon footprint,” have little chance of making an accurate calculation of the relative carbon use in, say, driving 250 miles as compared with flying 250 miles. A harmonized carbon tax would raise the price of a good proportionately to exactly the amount of CO2 that is emitted in all the stages of production that are involved in producing that good. If 0.01 of a ton of carbon emissions results from the wheat growing and the milling and the trucking and the baking of a loaf of bread, then a tax of $30 per ton carbon will raise the price of bread by $0.30. The “carbon footprint” is automatically calculated by the price system. Consumers would still not know how much of the price is due to carbon emissions, but they could make their decisions confident that they <b>are</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> the social cost of their carbon footprint.|$|E

500|$|The {{arguments}} for light rail were mainly {{related to the}} environment, urban development and reduction in road congestion. Light rail is estimated to increase {{the use of public}} transport from Fana, reducing both local and global pollution. The roads do not have capacity for further growth, and any increase in public transport would need to be taken along the light rail routes on buses—this would give higher operating costs for public transport or higher investment costs for roads. Around the stations, high-density commercial and residential centers can be established. Opponents of the project argued that it is unfair that public transport be funded by car drivers through toll roads.

2500|$|It {{is unclear}} {{what has been}} spent so far on {{planning}} and preparing for each pilot cull and who exactly is paying for what, i.e. what taxpayers <b>are</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> and what the farming industry is paying for. Costings of the culls have not factored in socio-economic costs, such as tourism and any potential boycotts of dairy products from the cull zones. Others opposed to the cull argue that for economic reasons the government have chosen the most inhumane approach to disease eradication. Tony Dean, Chairperson of the Gloucestershire Badger Group, warns that some badgers will not be killed outright: [...] "You {{have got to be}} a good marksman to kill a badger outright, with one shot... Many of the badgers will be badly injured. They will go back underground after being shot, probably badly maimed. They will die a long lingering death underground from lead poisoning etc. We {{are going to have a}} lot of cubs left underground where their mothers have been shot above ground." [...] He also suggests that domestic pets will be at risk in the cull areas, as some farmers will mistake black and white cats and dogs for badgers.|$|E

2500|$|The key {{competitor}} to the Google suite is Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft's cloud-based offering {{for businesses}} that includes similar products.

As noted by TechRepublic in 2013, pricing plans differ in that [...] "Google Apps has a quick and easy pricing plan for their standard Google Apps for Business package: $5 per user per month or $50 per user per year [...] In contrast, Office 365 has a multitude of plans (six as of September, 2013) which can be {{both good and bad}} since it provides flexibility but also involves some complexity to figure out the best choice". Storage space varies because [...] "Office 365 gives users 50GB of space in Outlook and 25GB in Skydrive. Google Apps provides 30GB of space which is spread among Gmail, Drive and Picasa". And regarding features, it states that [...] "Office 365 has the advantage for plenty of users who have been familiar with Word, Excel {{and the rest of the}} gang for years; there is less of a learning curve than with Google Apps if the latter represents a brand new experience [...] However, it's also true that Office is notorious for being loaded with complex, unused features which can cause confusion, so the familiarity many will embrace also comes with something of a price, especially if companies <b>are</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> advanced packages not all employees will use. By contrast, Google Apps programs are fairly easy to learn and intuitive, but may feel too awkward for those who are hard-coded to work in Office."
