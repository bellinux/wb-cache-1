5|$|Given {{the sufferings}} that some Indigenous {{children}} {{experienced in the}} Canadian Residential School system, the Holy Father expressed his sorrow at the <b>anguish</b> caused by the deplorable conduct of {{some members of the}} Church and he offered his sympathy and prayerful solidarity. His Holiness emphasized that acts of abuse cannot be tolerated in society. He prayed that all those affected would experience healing, and he encouraged First Nations Peoples to continue to move forward with renewed hope.|$|E
5|$|One Hot Minute was {{the only}} album that guitarist Dave Navarro {{recorded}} with the band. His presence altered the Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound considerably. It contains fewer sexual themes than previous records and explores darker subject matters, such as drug use, depression, <b>anguish,</b> and grief. It also re-integrated use of heavy metal guitar riffs. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis, who had resumed addictions to cocaine and heroin in 1994 after being sober {{for more than five}} years, approached his lyricism with a reflective outlook on drugs and their harsh effects.|$|E

50|$|In the {{meantime}} they fight the last Septentrione revealed as the <b>Anguished</b> One, Alcor. After defeating the other branches, the protagonist's group fights Polaris and following their victory, the world changes {{depending on the}} path chosen. If the player follows Yamato or Ronaldo, they convince Polaris to reshape {{the world to the}}ir desired image. If the player follows Daichi, they either convince Polaris to restore the world to the day before the invasion or assassinate Polaris and return to rebuild the now ruined world. If the player follows the <b>Anguished</b> One, they kill Polaris and install the <b>Anguished</b> One as the new Administrator of humanity, and he repairs the world.|$|R
5|$|Several {{natural causes}} (diseases) have been suggested, {{including}} malaria and typhoid fever. A 1998 {{article in the}} New England Journal of Medicine attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis. Another recent analysis suggested pyogenic (infectious) spondylitis or meningitis. Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including acute pancreatitis and West Nile virus. Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasize that Alexander's health {{may have been in}} general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The <b>anguish</b> that Alexander felt after Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health.|$|E

5|$|The {{eleventh}} nocturne {{was written}} in memory of Noémi Lalo; her widower, Pierre Lalo, was a music critic and a friend and supporter of Fauré. Morrison suggests that its funereal effect of tolling bells may also reflect the composer's own state of <b>anguish,</b> with deafness encroaching. The melodic line is simple and restrained, and except for a passionate section near the end is generally quiet and elegiac.|$|E

5|$|After Metternich's {{studies in}} Vienna, the Prince's death in September 1797 allowed Metternich to {{participate}} in the Congress of Rastatt. Initially his father took him as a secretary while ensuring that, when proceedings officially started in December 1797, he was named the representative of the Catholic Bench of the College of the Counts of Westphalia. A bored Metternich remained at Rastatt in this role until 1799 when the congress was finally wound down. During this period Eleonore had chosen to live with Metternich at Rastatt and gave birth to sons Francis (February 1798) and, shortly {{after the end of the}} Congress, Klemens (June 1799). Much to Metternich's <b>anguish</b> Klemens died after only a few days, and Francis soon contracted a lung infection from which he would never recover.|$|E

The pair rescue Elsa, with Kelso killing Hogeboom to put {{him out of his}} mental <b>anguish.</b> With the water level rising, the group use an open manhole to escape, but Phelps is swept away in the current. Whilst the SRF scam is exposed, several members escape justice by making a deal with the Assistant D.A. to testify. They attend Phelps's funeral, each delivering eulogies to his memory, much to the disgust of Elsa. Biggs remarks to Kelso that Phelps was never his friend, to which Kelso agrees but responds that he was never Phelps' enemy.|$|E
50|$|The {{events of}} the Triangulum Arc are set after {{the last day of}} the Septentrione Arc. The arc follows an ideal route not found in the {{original}} game, where the Protagonist joins Daichi and recruits everyone, but eventually also recruits the <b>Anguished</b> One into helping them kill Polaris. After Polaris' defeat, the <b>Anguished</b> One uses the Heavenly Throne to reset the world by accessing the old data within the Akashic Record and bring them back before the {{events of the}} game.|$|R

50|$|That night, all of {{the party}} members except the Protagonist have a {{nightmare}} {{in which they are}} all killed by the third Triangulum, Arcturus, except Yamato and the <b>Anguished</b> One, who barely defeat it, and the Protagonist, who is not present. The Protagonist then reunites with Jungo, Keita, Joe, and Ronaldo. While fighting the second Triangulum Spica's buds, the Protagonist's body starts to sporadically disappear. The Protagonist and his friends start to get suspicious of Miyako's intentions after discovering Denebola's core imprisoned inside the lab beneath JP's Osaka base. Their suspicions are furthered when Miyako also captures Spica before the Protagonist can kill it. With Fumi's aid, they sneak into an underground lab beneath the Sky Tower where they find the <b>Anguished</b> One imprisoned in a catatonic state. Miyako catches and arrests them, but they are saved by Otome and Makoto. The group defects from JP's and storms the Nagoya branch to use as a base of operations. They then sneak back into Tokyo and briefly awaken the <b>Anguished</b> One, who reveals that Yamato is alive at the Akasha Stratum and that they have fought Arcturus before. Since Yamato's Dragon Stream power is necessary to free the <b>Anguished</b> One, the party goes to the Akasha Stratum to bring back Yamato after receiving his death clip.|$|R
5|$|Crime and Punishment {{focuses on}} the mental <b>anguish</b> and moral {{dilemmas}} of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash. Raskolnikov, {{in an attempt to}} defend his actions, argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a vermin. He also commits the murder to test a theory of his that dictates some people are naturally capable of such actions, and even have the right to perform them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov compares himself with Napoleon Bonaparte and shares his belief that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collision}} Prime Minister Menzies ordered a Royal Commission {{to investigate the}} event. The Commissioner concluded that {{the collision}} was primarily the fault of Voyagers bridge crew not maintaining an effective lookout, but also placed blame on Melbournes Captain John Robertson (who resigned shortly after) and two other officers for failing to alert Voyager or take effective measures to avoid collision. The handing of the Royal Commission was seen as poor, and after a combination of public pressure and claims that Stevens had a drinking problem, a second Royal Commission was announced: the only time two Commissions have been held for the same incident. The second Royal Commission found that Stevens was likely medically unfit for command, {{that some of the}} first Commission's conclusions were therefore incorrect, and the Melbourne officers were not at fault. The two commissions caused great <b>anguish</b> in the hierarchy of the RAN, which was not accustomed to such tight scrutiny, and led to the eventual dismantling of the Naval Board's isolation from the civilian world.|$|E
5|$|Gupte {{described}} his character as mercurial, and found playing him a physical delight. Gupte said his character keeps the frame unpredictable {{and that it}} provided him with a foil to express rage and <b>anguish.</b> He worked a lot on his characterisation and tried to bring in his own references from European and Japanese cinema. Chandan Roy Sanyal {{described his}} character Mikhail as provocative, mad, wicked and humorous. Subramnayam and Joshi, who played Lobo and Lele respectively, described their characters as the most corrupt policemen in their department at the Anti-Narcotics Bureau. They said that {{to prepare for the}} roles they followed the script and Bhardwaj's instructions to get the characters right. Mukherjee prepared for his role as Mujeeb by reading the script and understanding the characters, and discussing it with Bhardwaj. Dutta, who played Shumona Bengali criminal involved in fixing horse races and arms dealingsaid {{that he did not have}} much time to prepare for his role because he was given the script after he arrived in Mumbai, where Bhardwaj briefed him.|$|E

5|$|The game restarted, {{but many}} Bayern players were {{overwhelmed}} with despair, virtually unable {{to continue and}} needed the assistance of referee Pierluigi Collina to drag themselves off the ground. They were stunned to have lost a game they had thought won just minutes before (several celebratory flares had already been ignited by the Munich fans moments before United equalised, and Bayern Munich ribbons had already been secured to the trophy itself {{in preparation for the}} presentation ceremony). United held onto their lead to record their second European Cup title. Samuel Kuffour broke down in tears after the game, beating the floor in despair, and even the giant Carsten Jancker had collapsed in <b>anguish.</b> Matthäus had captained Bayern in the 1987 European Cup Final and lost in similar circumstances to two late Porto goals. He had been substituted with 10 minutes remaining, with victory seemingly assured, and the European Cup was the only major trophy he had failed to win during his career.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the poem, Gawain {{encounters}} numerous trials testing {{his devotion}} {{and faith in}} Christianity. When Gawain sets out on his journey to find the Green Chapel, he finds himself lost, and only after praying to the Virgin Mary does he find his way. As he continues his journey, Gawain once again faces <b>anguish</b> regarding his inevitable encounter with the Green Knight. Instead of praying to Mary, as before, Gawain places his faith in the girdle {{given to him by}} Bertilak's wife. From the Christian perspective, this leads to disastrous and embarrassing consequences for Gawain as he is forced to reevaluate his faith when the Green Knight points out his betrayal. Another interpretation sees the work in terms of the perfection of virtue, with the pentangle representing the moral perfection of the connected virtues, the Green Knight as Christ exhibiting perfect fortitude, and Gawain as slightly imperfect in fortitude by virtue of flinching when under the threat of death.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{waking up}} again, Wells is {{surprised}} to find no bullet wounds on his body. Scully and Doggett arrive to interrogate Wells, but he is confused {{about what is going}} on. A furious Doggett claims that he has been accused of murdering his wife, Vicky, and initially believes that Wells is faking his confusion in order to build an insanity defense. However, Doggett shows signs of doubt when he notices Wells' genuine <b>anguish</b> over Vicky's death. Wells is brought into court and he recognizes his father-in-law, Al Cawdry, as the man who shot him. When Wells' next court date is announced to be Thursday, he realizes that he has somehow travelled back to the day before his shooting. When the judge decides to transfer Wells to a different cell, he makes a scene in the court and accuses Cawdry of planning to kill him during the transfer.|$|E

According to the Yamato, the Septentriones are actually trials sent by its leader Polaris who plans to destroy the mankind. The <b>Anguished</b> One further reveals Polaris is a divine entity that controls the fate of multiple parallel worlds and that rather than deleting the world it can recreate it. Once all Septentriones are defeated, Polaris will appear to mankind and listen to their will.|$|R

If the <b>Anguished</b> One's suggestion is chosen, the protagonist sacrifices his humanity to become an Administrator, returning peace to the human world. If Yamato's suggestion is chosen, the party creates a new world free of the Akashic Record so invaders will cease to exist altogether in the new world at the cost of being unable to reset the world again as well as losing both the <b>Anguished</b> One and Miyako (unless the Protagonist has fully befriended them, in which case they will be reincarnated as ordinary humans).|$|R
