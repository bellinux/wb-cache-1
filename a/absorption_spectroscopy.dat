25|$|Tyndall {{explained}} {{the heat in}} the Earth's atmosphere {{in terms of the}} capacities of the various gases in the air to absorb radiant heat, also known as infrared radiation. His measuring device, which used thermopile technology, is an early landmark in the history of <b>absorption</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> of gases. He was the first to correctly measure the relative infrared absorptive powers of the gases nitrogen, oxygen, water vapour, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, etc. (year 1859). He concluded that water vapour is the strongest absorber of radiant heat in the atmosphere and is the principal gas controlling air temperature. Absorption by the other gases is not negligible but relatively small. Prior to Tyndall it was widely surmised that the Earth's atmosphere has a Greenhouse Effect, but {{he was the first to}} prove it. The proof was that water vapour strongly absorbed infrared radiation. Relatedly, Tyndall in 1860 was first to demonstrate and quantify that visually transparent gases are infrared emitters.|$|E
40|$|Iridium-based {{materials}} {{are among the}} most active and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. Amorphous iridium oxide structures are found to be more active than their crystalline counterparts. Herein, we combine synchrotron-based X-ray photoemission and <b>absorption</b> <b>spectroscopies</b> with theoretical calculations to investigate the electronic structure of Ir metal, rutile-type IrO 2, and an amorphous IrO x. Theory and experiment show that while the Ir 4 f line shape of Ir metal is well described by a simple Doniach–Šunjić function, the peculiar line shape of rutile-type IrO 2 requires the addition of a shake-up satellite 1 [*]eV above the main line. In the catalytically more active amorphous IrO x, we find that additional intensity appears in the Ir 4 f spectrum at higher binding energy when compared with rutile-type IrO 2 along with a pre-edge feature in the O K-edge. We identify these additional features as electronic defects in the anionic and cationic frameworks, namely, formally O I− and Ir III, which may explain the increased activity of amorphous IrO x electrocatalysts. We corroborate our findings by in situ X-ray diffraction as well as in situ X-ray photoemission and <b>absorption</b> <b>spectroscopies...</b>|$|R

500|$|Atomic <b>absorption</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (AAS) is a {{destructive}} technique that {{is able to}} determine the elements {{that make up the}} analyzed sample. [...] AAS performs this analysis by subjecting the sample to an extremely high heat source, breaking the atomic bonds of the substance, leaving free atoms. Radiation in the form of light is then passed through the sample forcing the atoms to jump to a higher energy state. [...] Forensic chemists can test for each element by using a corresponding wavelength of light that forces that element's atoms to a higher energy state during the analysis. [...] For this reason, and due to the destructive nature of this method, AAS is generally used as a confirmatory technique after preliminary tests have indicated the presence of a specific element in the sample. [...] The concentration of the element in the sample is proportional to the amount of light absorbed when compared to a blank sample. [...] AAS is useful in cases of suspected heavy metal poisoning such as with arsenic, lead, mercury, and cadmium. The concentration of the substance in the sample can indicate whether heavy metals were the cause of death.|$|E
