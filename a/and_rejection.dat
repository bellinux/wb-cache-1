5|$|After passing his exam, Woodruff {{entered his}} {{position}} at Sheffield, where he trained in emergency and elective surgery. Originally, {{he had planned}} to do surgical research, but Sheffield had no space for him in its surgical lab. Instead, Woodruff was given a place in the pathology laboratory where he studied transplant rejection, a process in which the immune system of a transplant recipient attacks the transplanted tissue. Woodruff was particularly interested in thyroid allografts to the anterior chamber of the eye because they did not appear to meet with rejection. Woodruff's work with the allografts gave him a solid basis to work in the developing field of transplantion <b>and</b> <b>rejection.</b> To further himself in these areas, Woodruff arranged to meet Peter Medawar, an eminent zoologist and important pioneer in the study of rejection. The two men discussed transplantation <b>and</b> <b>rejection,</b> beginning a lasting professional relationship. Despite his achievements at Sheffield, Woodruff was rejected upon applying for a post at the Royal Melbourne Hospital.|$|E

5|$|Smuts's {{engagement}} with politics {{was very much}} a product of his time at Stellenbosch. While his parent's political moderation <b>and</b> <b>rejection</b> of Afrikaner exclusivism had left him largely unencumbered by any innate prejudices, it was his time at Victoria College which saw him develop his own independent political outlook. These views developed in tandem with another of Smuts's fixations, his philosophical pursuit of the embodiment of unity. This intellectual quest was later to develop into his philosophy of Holism, but even at this early undeveloped stage he brought these ideas to bear in shaping his political opinions. So it was that Smuts emerged as an outspoken supporter of South African unity, and, by extension, a supporter of Rhodes.|$|E
5|$|Convict {{cichlids}} {{may show}} extended biparental care and adopt unrelated young {{of the same}} species of similar or smaller body size compared to their own biological offspring. The parents may benefit by adopting smaller young by taking advantage of the dilution effect, which is when the risk of predation for an individual is reduced because the group size is larger. Another reason that has been considered is that foreign young that are larger than the biological offspring may be a direct predatory threat to them. However, {{it has been shown that}} as the biological offspring develop and become stronger swimmers, the parents are less active about rejecting larger foreign young, but when they do reject, often foreign young are rejected before they are large enough to be perceived as a direct threat to the biological offspring. Thus, it can be concluded that the brood adoption <b>and</b> <b>rejection</b> rely more heavily on the protection of the biological offspring from differential predator instead of from larger adopted cichlids.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal <b>and</b> <b>rejection</b> of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{incident}} that closed his railroad, Walt Disney consulted with Roger Broggie about the concept of including his ridable miniature train in a potential tour of Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, north of Downtown Los Angeles. Broggie, believing {{that there would be}} limited visitor capacity for the attraction, recommended to Disney that he make the train bigger in scale. The idea of a studio tour was eventually replaced by the idea of an amusement park named Disneyland {{across the street from the}} studio, and in one of its first design concepts at that proposed location, a miniature steam train ride was included, as well as a larger, narrow-gauge steam railroad attraction. During this time, Disney proposed that the narrow-gauge Crystal Springs & Southwestern Railroad, which the nearby Travel Town Museum in Griffith Park planned to build, be extended to run through Disneyland. Planned construction of the Ventura Freeway across land between the two sites, <b>and</b> <b>rejection</b> by the Burbank City Council of a new amusement park in their city, led Disney to look for a different location to build the park and its narrow-gauge railroad.|$|E
5|$|Debra {{turns up}} unexpectedly, {{claiming}} she is homeless, but reveals she {{is planning to}} move to Greece when she has enough money and says Whitney can come with her. Whitney accepts, but later realises that Debra is using her and she is only there to hide from someone. Debra later tells Whitney she has a half-brother, Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott). Whitney then takes back her statement against Tony but after Whitney's barrister sees her mobile phone containing the messages from Tony, he is sentenced to 13 years' imprisonment. During the trial Whitney learns that Tiffany is Ricky's daughter. She is initially distressed, but accepts that Tiffany is still her sister although they are not related. She repairs her friendship with Todd, and they kiss at Ricky and Bianca's engagement party. Their reunion is short-lived, and Whitney breaks up with him in favour of Bianca's half-brother Billie Jackson (Devon Anderson). Whitney is attacked by Billie's jealous friend Kylie (Elarica Gallacher), and when his friends cause trouble at a grime night at The Queen Victoria pub (The Vic), Whitney asks him to choose between her and his former gang. Billie chooses Whitney, and Kylie takes revenge by attempting to shoot him, shooting his uncle Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) instead. Jack is hospitalised with major injuries, and Whitney struggles to help Billie deal with his guilt and subsequent anger <b>and</b> <b>rejection</b> from the Branning and Jackson families. She is further deeply upset when Billie decides to join the army {{in an attempt to}} make Jack proud. At Billie's birthday party, Whitney ends up kissing Peter. She spends the night with him and the next day is upset to learn that Billie has died in his sleep. She blames herself for leaving the party after she sees a text message from Billie saying he still loved her. She sends a reply and lays flowers and candles for him. However, she later goes back to Peter for comfort, and he comforts her again {{on the day of the}} funeral. The pair then begin a relationship. However Billie's friend Connor Stanley (Arinze Kene), starts flirting with her, and asks her why she'd date someone like Peter after dating Billie. He also asks her to sell some stolen jewellery for him and she agrees.|$|E

40|$|To {{differentiate}} between acute <b>and</b> chronic lung <b>rejection</b> {{in an early}} stage, phenotypes of infiltrating inflammatory cells were analyzed in 34 transbronchial biopsies (TBBs) of 24 patients after heart-lung transplantation. TBBs were taken during during acute lung <b>rejection</b> <b>and</b> chronic lung <b>rejection,</b> as diagnosed by clinical data and histopathological investigation. TBBs without <b>rejection</b> <b>and</b> normal lung tissue specimens served as controls. Distinct phenotypes of inflammatory cells were found in acute <b>and</b> chronic lung <b>rejection.</b> T cells were present both in acute <b>and</b> in chronic <b>rejection,</b> but did not {{differentiate between}} them. In contrast, B cells with antibody deposition were mainly present in chronic <b>rejection</b> <b>and</b> not in acute rejection. Activated macrophages were present only in acute <b>rejection</b> <b>and</b> not in chronic rejection. In nonrejecting lung transplants, perivascular infiltrating cells were virtually absent. In the biopsy specimen, vessels had to be available for analysis, because the cell phenotypes were best recognized in perivascular infiltrates.

40|$|There {{have been}} a few studies concerned, from the {{standpoint}} of developmental trends, with the mutual choices <b>and</b> <b>rejections</b> in the classroom. The present study represents an attempt to explore the developmental trend, if any, observed in relation to the mutual choices <b>and</b> <b>rejections,</b> with relatively large samples of 10 months' acquaintanceship. The sociometric criterion situation employed in this study was in the area of cleaning duty of the classroom and the playground. To calculate tac and tar, both five choices <b>and</b> <b>rejections</b> were analyzed, though unlimited choices <b>and</b> <b>rejections</b> were allotted in the sociometric test. Median tests were conducted to evaluate the developmental trends. Ss were from grade 1 through 8; 7 classrooms each of 1 st-, 3 rd-, and 5 th-graders, with 7 classrooms of 7 th-and 8 th-graders combined. An analysis and comparison of the data revealed the following findings: (1) As shown in Table 3 and Fig. 1, the magnitude of tac, very similar to that of Tanaka's (1964), tends, as a whole, to increase as grade level increases, though the difference between lst-graders and 3 rd-graders, and that between 5 th-graders and 7 th-and 8 th-graders combined, both, fail to reach statistical significance. This result, while based upon tentative measures and a restricted sample, may safely be interpretedto indicate that there is a tendency for mutual choices to increase with increasing grades. (2) As shown in Table 4, tar does not, contrary to our prediction, show a significant decrease in magnitude among upper-graders, H-test revealed that {{there were no significant differences}} among the four grade-groups involved, which fact is consistent with the findings reported by Tanaka (1964). (3) These results mentioned above were compared with those obtained in earlier studies and some discussion was made in regard to the agreements and discrepancies...|$|R
