25|$|Norbert Wiener's {{book was}} {{the forerunner of}} studies in cybernetics, and has {{influenced}} many theorists. It has impacted the fields of computers and technology, engineering, biology, sociology, and {{a broad range of}} other sciences. Numerous books have been published in relation to cybernetics theory which explore alternative concepts and models of feedback, human/machine relationships, systems science, and industrial advancement. William Ross Ashby, another founder of cybernetics, wrote the book Introduction to Cybernetics, which presents many new interpretations and definitions. Other theorists have produced writings on systems, communication, and the human experience in cybernetics. N. Katherine Hayles, author of How We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature, and Informatics, describes the effects of technology in the age of virtual information <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> for humans to live in an ever-advancing society. The American Society for Cybernetics (ASC) is a research association founded in 1964, the same year Wiener died, and is dedicated to the cooperative understanding and further improvement of cybernetics theory.|$|E

He concluded by calling Cowen's appeal to [...] "realistic expectations" [...] about growth a [...] "weird conservative echo" [...] of the Club of Rome's liberal [...] "era of limits gospel from the 1970s". In the summer of 2012, Robert Gordon's paper, [...] "Is U.S. Economic Growth Over?" [...] prompted comparisons to Cowen's thesis. Gordon also points out that the easy gains of increased labor force participation, schooling or land use have been spent, while other major innovations or industries—such as transport or sanitation—have enjoyed only gradual improvement.|$|E

500|$|Previous {{seasons of}} Buffy the Vampire Slayer had ended with an action episode which tied {{up all the}} threads of the season's main plot line, but series creator Joss Whedon wanted to end season four differently. The {{penultimate}} episode, [...] "Primeval", had concluded the Initiative storyline, but Whedon felt the season's overall story arc had not been as cohesive as it could have been, and therefore chose to create an episode {{to act as a}} [...] "grace note" [...] to the season, an episode which would comment on each of the four main characters and what they had just been through. While talking about the writing of the episode, Whedon said it had been like writing poetry, a process he found [...] "liberating and strange". Like the earlier [...] "Hush" [...] — an episode with almost no dialogue — he viewed the episode as an exercise in form and writing, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> to write. The episode has no real structure, which was a departure for Whedon, as everything he had written before was constructed before even starting the script. Yet despite its fragmented style, the episode unfolds coherently in four discrete acts, each act comprising one character's dream.|$|E
