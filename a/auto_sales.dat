40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to {{research}} {{on the issue of}} <b>auto</b> <b>sale</b> in United State, which is critical to the automobile industry as well as overall economy. The American automobile market is affected by various factors, from both internal and external environment. In order to figure out the correlation among factors, we research on its historical performance in relation to many factors that may affect the automobile industry. Data about automobile sales and many economic and demographic variables are collected from a variety of sources. Automobile sales within U. S. are the dependent variable and the rest are independent variables. By using stepwise method in SPSS, the significant variables are selected and the first regression model is developed based on these variables. Next, we add a lag to all and some independent variables separately and come up with the second and third regression models. By comparing the adjusted R-square, we finally choose the optimized regression model to forecast U. S. automobile sales. The results indicate that some of the factors which significantly reflect the internal and external impact on the automobile market. By implementing historical data of each factor to the model, it can forecast the <b>auto</b> <b>sale</b> in U. S. domestic market. The results in this study could help the automakers better understand the domestic auto market...|$|R

25|$|Transportation consumes {{the largest}} {{proportion}} of energy, and {{has seen the}} largest growth in demand in recent decades. This growth has largely come from new demand for cars and other personal-use vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. This sector also has the highest consumption rates, accounting for approximately 55% of oil use worldwide as documented in the Hirsch report and 68.9% of the oil used in the United States in 2006. Cars and trucks are predicted to cause almost 75% {{of the increase in}} oil consumption by India and China between 2001 and 2025.

Among them, {{steel and}} aluminum production were scaled back {{due to a}} significant shortage of raw materials and loss of production of about 50,000 tonnes of lead and zinc was forecasted in Hunan. Telecom companies had significant repair costs as about 10,000kilometers of lines were affected. The Ministry of Information Industry mentioned that this has affected 33million users and cost at least 80million yuan up until 27 January. Other sectors affected were hotels, airlines and <b>auto</b> <b>sales</b> while other businesses had disruption in the supply of products because of transportation delays.

25|$|For 15 years, Wayne Schmuck of Harvard, Illinois, {{owner of}} Big Foot <b>Auto</b> <b>Sales,</b> had sold used cars {{he had bought}} in his state, where vehicle titles did not then require a {{statement}} on {{the title of the}} odometer reading {{at the time of the}} transaction, to dealers in Wisconsin, which did. Unbeknownst to the dealers, he had in some cases hired someone to roll back the odometers on them, making the vehicles appear to have less mileage than they actually did. Thus they commanded an artificially higher price, both when the dealer paid Schmuck and when they sold it to a customer. In order for the retail transaction to take place, the dealers needed to mail a title application, including the falsified odometer reading, to the state Department of Transportation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} five months of 2010, <b>auto</b> <b>sales</b> in the U.S. rose to 4.6million cars and light trucks, an {{increase}} of 17% from a year earlier. The rise was mainly caused by the return of commercial customers that had all but stopped buying in 2009 during the recession. Sales to individual customers at dealerships have increased 13% while fleet sales have jumped 32%. Ford reported that 37% of its sales in May came from fleet sales when it announced its sales for the month increased 23%. In the first seven months of 2010, vehicle sales of Ford increased 24%, including retail and fleet sales. Fleet sales of Ford for the same period rose 35% to 386,000 units while retail sales increase 19%. Fleet sales account for 39 percent of Chrysler's sales and 31 percent for GM's.|$|E

25|$|GDP, long {{stuck at}} its 1973 level {{even with a}} growing population, grew by about a third from early 1991 to late 1994. Fixed investment, {{depressed}} since the 1981–82 crisis, more than doubled during this period. Consumers also benefited: income poverty fell by about half (to under 20%) and new <b>auto</b> <b>sales</b> (likewise depressed since 1982) jumped fivefold, to about 500,000 units. This boom, however, had its problems early on. Tight federal budgets kept the budget deficits of the provinces from improving and, though many benefited from Cavallo's insistence that large employers translate higher productivity into higher pay, this same productivity boom (as well as the nearly 200,000 layoffs the privatizations caused) helped unemployment jump from about 7% in 1991–92 to over 12%, by 1994. The 1995 Mexican Crisis shocked consumer and business confidence and ratcheted joblessness to 18% (the highest since the 1930s).|$|E

500|$|The United States economy {{went into}} a {{recession}} in the early 1920s and automobile sales decreased. Coupled with increasing competition, Haynes Automobile Company began running into debt problems. Haynes had to use [...] his personal savings to rescue the company in 1921 and pay off some outstanding accounts. A bond drive was launched to raise $1million to help fund the company through the period, but it fell significantly short of raising enough money. Haynes [...] was the primary purchaser of the bonds. Unlike the other large auto companies like Ford and General Motors, Haynes Auto {{did not have the}} widespread dealership agreements that were able to sustain their companies through the hard times; his company relied on customer's ordering directly from the factory. Haynes <b>Auto</b> <b>sales</b> quickly began to slip from a peak of nearly 6,000 cars sold in 1922. In 1923 sales dropped to 4,300, and 1,500 in 1924. The situation continued to be bleak for the company, and it was forced to declare bankruptcy in October 1924. Haynes sought a merger with multiple other auto companies, including Henry Ford, but partners were not forthcoming and Haynes was forced to agree to a liquidation in 1925. He was held personally responsible for about $95,000 of the company's debt. In addition, he lost $335,700 in stock he held in the company and a substantial amount in investment bonds. In total, the loss cost Haynes an estimated quarter of his net worth.|$|E

Frame homes were damaged or destroyed, vehicles were tossed and damaged, numerous trees were snapped and denuded, and mobile homes were obliterated with debris and insulation strewn long distances downwind. Ten homes were destroyed, and 23 homes had major damage along this segment of the path. As {{a result of the}} tornado, a major fire occurred as a natural gas plant was ripped apart by the tornado in the southwestern portion of the county. The area was evacuated and no one was injured at the plant. Two people were killed at a home along U.S. Route 231, and five other people were injured in the county. Crossing into Macon County, the tornado regained EF3 intensity as it struck the western and northern sections of Lafayette, resulting in widespread, major destruction in the area. Numerous homes and several churches were destroyed in Lafeyette, with several leveled to the ground. An <b>auto</b> <b>sales</b> business in town sustained heavy damage as well. Surveyors observed major damage to a large, expensive brick home that was built unanchored on a very weak, unreinforced cinder block foundation. The house shifted off the foundation during the tornado, causing walls to buckle and collapse. 170 homes were destroyed, and 9 homes had major damage in the Lafeyette area. 13 people were killed in and around town, and 44 others were injured. President George W. Bush toured the Macon County destruction on February 8 and promised relief to individuals. The logging industry in Macon County was hit hard, with about a million dollars worth of trees destroyed. Debris from Lafeyette was found as far north as Sano, Kentucky, in Adair County, approximately [...] to the northeast. Sixteen thousand TVA electricity customers in Macon and Trousdale Counties lost power, some of whom did not have their service restored for a week. Macon County schools were closed until February 19.
