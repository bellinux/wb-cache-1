40|$|Background It {{is unclear}} whether the {{additional}} removal of breast tissue during breast-conserving therapy (BCT) for breast cancer beyond the standard lumpectomy reduces the incidence of inadequate microscopic margins found at pathological examination and subsequent reoperation. This study compares the reoperative rates after initial BCT in 3 groups of patients who underwent lumpectomy with complete resection of 4 to 6 <b>additional</b> <b>margins,</b> lumpectomy with selective resection of 1 to 3 <b>additional</b> <b>margins,</b> or standard lumpectomy. Methods Retrospective data were reviewed from 171 selected cases of BCT, from May 2000 to February 2006. Forty-five cases involved lumpectomy with complete resection of 4 to 6 additional margins; 77 involved lumpectomy with selective resection of 1 to 3 <b>additional</b> <b>margins,</b> whereas 49 involved standard lumpectomy. All samples underwent pathologic analysis of inked resection margins by permanent section. The 3 groups were compared for patient demographics, tumor size and histologic subtype, tumor stage, margin status, excised specimen volume, and eventual subsequent reoperation. Adequate surgical margin was defined as any negative margin greater than 2 mm. Results The group with complete resection of 4 to 6 <b>additional</b> <b>margins</b> had a subsequent reoperation rate of 17. 7 %, whereas the group with selective resection of 1 to 3 <b>additional</b> <b>margins</b> and the standard lumpectomy group had a subsequent reoperation rate of 32. 5 % and 38. 7 %, respectively, because of inadequate margins. The mean total excised specimen volume in the 3 groups was 129. 19, 46. 04, and 37. 44 cm 3, respectively. Conclusions The complete resection of 4 to 6 <b>additional</b> <b>margins</b> during the initial BCT resulted in the lowest subsequent reoperation rate, and the largest total volume specimen excised among the 3 techniques studied...|$|R

30|$|The {{presence}} of carcinoma {{in the first}} excised surgical margins on this cohort was 20  % (5 of 25) and all cases were demonstrated by the specimen sonogram. Of the five patients with positive pathology margins, one underwent to mastectomy in another day and 4 (80  %) had <b>additional</b> <b>margins</b> excised by surgeon during the same surgical appointment and none were involved by invasive carcinoma and in just one patient the <b>additional</b> <b>margins</b> were involved by DCIS. Presence of residual carcinoma on re-excision are reported in 29 – 45  % of patients (Cao et al. 2005; Scopa et al. 2006). The estimated rate of residual carcinoma on re-excision after using the sonographic technique in this cohort went from 40  % (2 of 5) to a corrected rate of 8  % (2 of 25) because one patient had re-excision in another day. From patient’s perspective there is anxiety and stress to undergo additional surgery {{despite the fact that}} this is under studied in the literature.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} ability of rural {{electric}} cooperatives to retire member equity under three strategies: (1) replacing equity with term debt to provide for an immediate one-time retirement of capital credits, (2) reducing {{the rate at which}} equity is accumulated and relying more on term debt to finance asset growth so margins can be used to accelerate the retirement of capital credits, and (3) adjusting the electric rate to generate <b>additional</b> <b>margins</b> for retiring capital credits. Analyses suggest that the average distribution cooperative could employ these strategies to expand capital credits retirement substantially without weakening its financial condition...|$|R
40|$|This report proposes and {{documents}} a computational benchmark {{problem for the}} estimation of the <b>additional</b> reactivity <b>margin</b> available in spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from fission products and minor actinides in a burnup-credit storage/transport environment, relative to SNF compositions containing only the major actinides. The benchmark problem/configuration is a generic burnup credit cask designed to hold 32 pressurized water reactor (PWR) assemblies. The purpose of this computational benchmark {{is to provide a}} reference configuration for the estimation of the <b>additional</b> reactivity <b>margin,</b> which is encouraged in the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) guidance for partial burnup credit (ISG 8), and document reference estimations of the <b>additional</b> reactivity <b>margin</b> as a function of initial enrichment, burnup, and cooling time. Consequently, the geometry and material specifications are provided in sufficient detail to enable independent evaluations. Estimates of <b>additional</b> reactivity <b>margin</b> for this reference configuration may be compared to those of similar burnup-credit casks to provide an indication of the validity of design-specific estimates of fission-product margin. The reference solutions were generated with the SAS 2 H-depletion and CSAS 25 -criticality sequences of the SCALE 4. 4 a package. Although the SAS 2 H and CSAS 25 sequences have been extensively validated elsewhere, the reference solutions are not directly or indirectly based on experimental results. Consequently, this computational benchmark cannot be used to satisfy the ANS 8. 1 requirements for validation of calculational methods and is not intended to be used to establish biases for burnup credit analyses...|$|R

40|$|Foreign {{manufacturers}} {{have the option}} of using sales networks of domestic rival firms to save local distribution costs. Such alliances may lead to collusion or create greater distortions because of the <b>additional</b> <b>margins</b> imposed by foreign firms, as shown in the theoretical literature. This paper empirically examines whether these outcomes are realized by alliances using Japanese antibiotics market data, where cross-border alliances are common. Empirical results show that the marginal costs of products supplied through cross-border alliances are lower than those supplied by foreign firms, suggesting that alliances are effective devices to reduce local distribution costs for foreign firms. Furthermore, my test results reveal little evidence of collusion or high markups caused by cross-border alliances. ...|$|R
30|$|However, the {{recently}} proposed background correction technique is {{highly dependent on}} segmentation accuracy as shown in Fig.  8. This is important especially for pelvic scans where the bladder changes in volume and shape over time. Our result showed that the segmentation error is pronounced after 10  mins where the bladder expands majorly in an anterior direction towards the rectum and superior to the pelvic organs. This {{is in line with}} past studies [42, 43] which showed that bladder expands primarily in the superior anterior direction, and hence, addition of anisotropic margins to the bladder is necessary. The translation of this correction technique to clinical application would need {{to take into account the}} inaccuracy in bladder segmentation either by adding <b>additional</b> <b>margins</b> or by manual correction as suggested by past studies.|$|R

50|$|Example 1: An {{investor}} sells a put option, {{where the}} buyer {{has the right}} to require the seller to buy his 100 shares in Universal Widgets S.A. at 90¢. He receives an option premium of 14¢. The value of the option is 14¢, so this is the premium margin. The exchange has calculated, using historical prices, that the option value will not exceed 17¢ the next day, with 99% certainty. Therefore, the <b>additional</b> <b>margin</b> requirement is set at 3¢, and the investor has to post at least 14¢ (obtained from the sale) + 3¢ = 17¢ in his margin account as collateral.|$|E

The current liquidating margin is currently £60 [...] "in favour of the investor". The minimum margin requirement is now -£60 + £10 = -£50. In other words, the investor can run a deficit of £50 in his margin account and still fulfil his margin obligations. This {{is the same as}} saying he can borrow up to £50 from the broker.|$|E
30|$|This {{pilot study}} has some limitations: the {{presence}} of palpable lesions that were present may have had some impact in the surgeon’s decision to include <b>additional</b> <b>margins</b> that were found without clear correlation with the imaging or pathology outcomes. This type of bias may not be feasible to be removed in the clinical scenario that includes multiple surgeons and reflects the usual procedures. Another {{limitation of this study}} was not recording the time spent in performing the specimen sonogram in addition to the standard of care digital radiograph of the specimen. The mean time required for technique using immersion of the specimen on saline solution was reported as 5.2  min by a group from Korea (Lee et al. 2008). Therefore, we believe that the additional time for scanning the specimens is acceptable in a standard of care clinical practice.|$|R
40|$|The optimal income {{taxation}} framework is extended {{to account for}} heterogeneity in avoidance behavior.

When the choice of administration is added to the model, it is demonstrated that the optimal tax system may include some seemingly wasteful avoidance schemes, even if they could be eliminated without any cost. When an avoidance scheme is more heavily used by the needy, it may provide additional redistribution without affecting standard incentive constraints.

50|$|Short squeezes result when short sellers {{cover their}} {{positions}} on a stock, resulting in buying volume that drives the stock price up.
