5|$|At the 2008 ICF Congress in Rome, a {{new program}} for the championships was approved. This marked the first change in the program since the {{addition}} of the K-4 1000 m women's event at the 2001 championships in Poznań. Men's C-4 500 m, men's K-4 500 m, women's K-4 1000 m events were replaced by C-1 4 × 200 m relay (men only) and K-1 4 × 200 m relay (both men and women). Women's C-1 200 m, C-1 500 m, C-2 200 m and C-2 500 m events were shown as exhibition. Paddleability exhibition events of K-1 200 m LTA (men & women), K-2 200 m TA (mixed), and C-2 200 m LTA (mixed) also took place (LTATA – Legs, Trunks, and <b>Arms</b> <b>or</b> Trunks and Arms; LTA – Legs, Trunks, and Arms; and TA – Trunks and <b>Arms,</b> <b>or</b> Arms). Support for women's Canadian and the paddle ability events were confirmed at an ICF Board of Directors meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 18–20 March 2009. A training camp was held for women's canoe in conjunction with the championships.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson {{had arrived}} in North Carolina in early September 1780 to recruit troops for the Loyalist militia and protect the flank of Lord Cornwallis' main force. Ferguson issued a {{challenge}} to the rebel militias to lay down their <b>arms</b> <b>or</b> suffer the consequences. In response, the Patriot militias led by Benjamin Cleveland, James Johnston, William Campbell, John Sevier, Joseph McDowell and Isaac Shelby rallied for an attack on Ferguson.|$|E
5|$|His {{antiquarian}} studies led Planché to take {{an interest}} in heraldry. He had published several papers on heraldic topics in the Journal of the British Archaeological Association before publishing in 1852 The Pursuivant of <b>Arms,</b> <b>or,</b> Heraldry founded upon facts. As indicated by the subtitle, Planché was concerned with verifiable facts, as opposed to the unfounded theories perpetuated by many earlier heraldic writers. In the view of eminent herald Sir Anthony Wagner, Planché rewrote the early history of heraldry.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{territorial}} behaviour of caecilians, but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges. These are usually feeding, breeding or sheltering sites. Males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species, females and even juveniles are also involved. Although in many frog species, females are larger than males, {{this is not the}} case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence. Some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest, <b>arms</b> <b>or</b> thumbs.|$|E
5|$|Sigeberht abdicated {{in favour}} of his co-ruler Ecgric and retired to lead a monastic life, but soon {{afterwards}} the East Angles were attacked by Mercian forces, led by their king, Penda. Ecgric and his army appealed to Sigeberht to lead them into battle against the Mercians, {{but he refused to}} participate. He was dragged from his monastery to the battlefield, where, still refusing to bear <b>arms</b> <b>or</b> fight, he and Ecgric were slain and the defeated East Anglian army was destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a state coat of <b>arms</b> <b>or</b> seal has {{generally}} been authorized by {{a provision in the}} state constitution or a legislative act. In most instances a committee (more often than not consisting of three members) was appointed to study the issue, seek advice from qualified artists, historians, legal scholars, etc., and report back to the authorizing legislative body with a design for their approval. Historically, this committee has consisted of notable members of society and elected officials.|$|E

5|$|The shield is {{the core}} of heraldry, but other {{elements}} are placed above, below, and around the shield, and are usually collectively called external ornaments. The entire composition is called the achievement of <b>arms</b> <b>or</b> the armorial bearings. Some of these accessories are unique to Church armory or differ notably from those which normally accompany a shield.|$|E
5|$|According to the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules, {{the use of}} {{the coat}} of arms is {{restricted}} to the government. Without explicit permission from the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MICA), no person or group is permitted to physically print, manufacture, display or sell anything depicting the coat of <b>arms,</b> <b>or</b> to allow such actions to happen. It is also forbidden to use any symbol that can be easily mistaken for the coat of arms. Persons who wish to use the coat of arms in a literary work must also obtain prior permission from MICA. The only exception provided by the Rules is that the arms can be used by government officials and ministries on their building's exteriors and on printed documents.|$|E
5|$|Any Canadian citizen or {{corporate}} body can petition for {{a grant of}} new <b>arms</b> <b>or</b> registration of existing arms. In general, eligibility for a grant of arms {{is based on an}} individual's contributions to the community, although the exact criteria for grants or registrations have not been published. A number of grants have been made to people who have already been recognized with state honours for their notable achievements, such as through admission to the Order of Canada, and who are accordingly entitled to a grant of arms. Those who are Companions of the order may also request the chief herald to grant them supporters.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to this cancellation and rumors of an anti-Protestant alliance between Catholics and Native Americans, Protestant settlers formed an association to defend themselves. In July 1689, they marched on the colonial capital, St. Mary's City. Led by John Coode, the Protestant associators were quickly able to capture St. Mary's and the other major towns of the colony. The Governor {{and a number of}} other Calvert allies fled to Virginia. Charles Calvert turned for relief to the Lords of Trade and eventually to the Privy Council, but these groups sided with the Protestants and took away the power of the Calvert family to govern the colony. Soon thereafter, the new leaders of the colony barred Catholics from holding office, bearing <b>arms,</b> <b>or</b> serving on juries.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to change one's coat of arms, with or without adopting or appending a new surname, by Royal Licence, {{that is to say}} a licence {{in the form of a}} warrant from the Crown directed to the Kings of Arms instructing them to exemplify the transferred <b>arms</b> <b>or</b> a version of them to the licensee in his or her new name. Royal Licences are issued on the advice of Garter King of Arms and are usually dependent on there being some constraining circumstances such as a testamentary injunction (a requirement in a will) or a good reason to wish to perpetuate a particular coat of arms. The Royal Licence is of no effect until and unless the exemplification is issued and recorded in the College. Royal Licences are gazetted and make a deed poll unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|On October 30, the {{batteries}} opened fire. In four hours, a breach was largely {{opened in the}} ramparts. Then, an emissary {{came out with a}} white flag to negotiate the terms of the fort’s surrender. General Maison replied that the terms had been negotiated {{at the beginning of the}} month at Patras. He added that he did not trust a group of besieged men who had not respected a first agreement to respect a second one. He gave the garrison half an hour to evacuate the fort, without <b>arms</b> <b>or</b> baggage. The aghas submitted. However, the fortress’ resistance had cost 25 men, killed or wounded in the French expedition.|$|E

5|$|The {{karyotype}} includes 80 chromosomes with a {{total of}} 86 major arms (2n=80; FN=86). The X chromosome is subtelocentric (with one pair of long arms and one pair of short arms) and the Y chromosome is acrocentric (with only one pair of <b>arms,</b> <b>or</b> with a minute second pair). Among the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes), the four metacentric or submetacentric (with two pairs of arms as long as or not much shorter than the other) pairs of chromosomes are small, and the 35 pairs of acrocentrics range from large to small. Some of those have a minute second pair of arms and could also be classified as subtelocentric, which would raise FN to 90. This karyotype is similar to other known karyotypes of members of Euryoryzomys.|$|E
5|$|The {{law also}} restricts {{the use of}} the emblem in other contexts—e.g. cities, towns or oblasts may not adopt a coat of <b>arms</b> <b>or</b> emblem using the {{national}} emblem either completely or in part. Furthermore, organizations not listed in the Law on State Symbols may only use the emblem by permission. The emblem can be used by both foreigners and citizens of Belarus, as long as the symbol is displayed with respect, although citizens may not use the state emblem on letterheads or business cards if they are not agents of the government.|$|E
5|$|The third Venezuelan republic's envoy in the British capital {{borrowed}} £1,000 for MacGregor {{to engage}} and transport British troops for service in Venezuela, but the Scotsman squandered these funds {{within a few}} weeks. A London financier, {{an old friend of}} MacGregor's called Thomas Newte, took responsibility for the envoy's debt on the condition that the general instead take troops to New Granada. MacGregor funded his expedition through the sale of commissions at rates cheaper than those offered by the British Army, and assembled enlisted men through a network of recruiters across the British Isles, offering volunteers huge financial incentives. MacGregor sailed for South America on 18 November 1818 aboard a former Royal Navy brigantine, renamed the Hero; 50 officers and over 500 troops, many of them Irish, followed the next month. They were critically under-equipped, having virtually no <b>arms</b> <b>or</b> munitions.|$|E
