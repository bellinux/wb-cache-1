Many borrowed words in Berber also have native synonyms, e.g. /lbab/ or /tiflut/ 'door', the latter used more in rural areas. The contact was unequal, as Moroccan Arabic has not borrowed <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>from</b> Berber languages, though Berber has contributed to Moroccan and Algerian Arabics' very reduced vowel systems.|$|E

The respected, independent, ambitious young Bureau Agent formed a close relationship with Frank Black—and then turned her back on him to join the Millennium Group, which had agreed to cure her father of Alzheimer's.|$|E

Although Cobb was a legendary player, he was disliked throughout the baseball community, even by his own teammates; and he expected <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>from</b> his players since he set a standard most players couldn't meet.|$|E

25|$|The {{treatise}} Semaḥot is a post-Talmudic {{product and}} originated in Palestine. This explains the many coincidences {{of its contents}} with the baraitot of the Jerusalem Talmud. It is a compilation from various older works; and in many passages traces of revision are to be noticed. The compiler incorporated a considerable part of the small Ebel, as well <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>from</b> other works, besides adding original matter.

Her harshness towards Paul probably stemmed <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>from</b> political distrust as from what she saw of his character. Keeping Paul {{in a state of}} semi-captivity in Gatchina and Pavlovsk, she resolved not to allow her son to dispute or to share in her authority during her lifetime.|$|E
25|$|As a {{composition}} teacher, Rubinstein could inspire his students and was noted for his generosity {{in time and}} effort he spent working with them, even after {{a full day of}} administrative work. He could also be exacting and expected <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>from</b> them as he gave to them. According to one of Tchaikovsky's fellow students, Alexandr Rubets, Rubinstein would sometimes begin class by reading some verses, then assign them to be set for either solo voice or chorus, depending on the student's preference. This assignment would be due the following day. At other times, he would expect students to improvise a minuet, a rondo, a polonaise or some other musical form.|$|E

25|$|Scholars have {{attempted}} a tentative chronology for the prints, essentially within {{the period from}} 1613 to 1616, based mainly on Bellange's increasing confidence and skill with the medium of etching, which was usually supplemented by {{a limited amount of}} engraving and, in a few cases, touches of drypoint. However, Griffiths and Hartley are too cautious to do so, noting that differences of technique can arise <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>from</b> the different requirements of individual plates as developing skill. Sue Welsh Reed, on the other hand, makes many comments on the assumed place of individual prints in a chronology, placing works like the Annunciation and Pietá among the last, and also seeing an increasing skill in composition as the sequence progresses.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{increases}} in prize funds over the years, this list consists entirely of current players. Two players on the list, Vijay Singh and Davis Love III, are eligible for PGA Tour Champions (having respectively turned 50 in February 2013 and April 2014). Both have lifetime exemptions on the PGA Tour for 20 wins and 15 years on the Tour, and Love has won a tournament on the main PGA Tour since turning 50. The figures are not the players' complete career prize money as they do not include FedEx Cup bonuses, winnings from unofficial money events, or earnings on other tours such as the European Tour. In addition, elite golfers often earn several times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>from</b> endorsements and golf-related business interests as they do from prize money.|$|E
