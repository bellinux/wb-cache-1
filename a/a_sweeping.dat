5|$|Blamey was {{appointed}} Commander in Chief of the Australian Military Forces on 27 March. He instituted <b>a</b> <b>sweeping</b> reorganisation of the Army, replacing officers {{with men who}} had experience in the Middle East. Simpson became the Signal Officer in Chief on 6 April, with the rank of major general, the first Australian Corps of Signals officer to reach that rank.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{was one of}} a few Republicans to back {{a measure}} to reform {{spending}} requirements in Colorado's state constitution. The proposal, which would have diverted excess revenues under TABOR to K-12 education, was regarded as <b>a</b> <b>sweeping</b> revision to competing constitutional mandates; it was not passed by the General Assembly, but was advanced as a citizens' initiative.|$|E
5000|$|Reverse {{sweepings}} {{are similar}} to those of forward ones, except for a sign difference for some multiplications. However, forward and reverse sweepings are opposite operations. It can be easily shown that applying the fully reverse sweeping to [...] will recover the initial moment matrix M(X). It can also be proved that applying <b>a</b> partial reverse <b>sweeping</b> on X to the matrix [...] will recover the moment matrix M(X,Y). As a matter of fact, Liu proves that a moment matrix will be recovered through <b>a</b> reverse <b>sweeping</b> after <b>a</b> forward <b>sweeping</b> on the same set of variables. It can be also recovered through <b>a</b> forward <b>sweeping</b> after <b>a</b> reverse <b>sweeping.</b> Intuitively, <b>a</b> partial forward <b>sweeping</b> factorizes <b>a</b> joint into a marginal and a conditional, whereas <b>a</b> partial reverse <b>sweeping</b> multiplies them into a joint.|$|R

5|$|At Los Alamos, Bradbury became head of E-5, the Implosion Experimentation Group, {{which put}} him {{in charge of the}} {{implosion}} field test program. In August, the laboratory's director, Robert Oppenheimer, implemented <b>a</b> <b>sweeping</b> reorganisation. E-5 became part of George Kistiakowsky's new Explosives Division (X Division), and was renumbered X-1. At this point, Bradbury was leading some of the most critical work at the laboratory, as it struggled with the jets that spoiled the perfect spherical shape desired for the implosion process. These were examined with a combination of magnetic, X-ray and RaLa techniques.|$|E
5|$|Barnett Frank (born March 31, 1940) is {{a former}} American {{politician}} and {{board member of the}} New York-based Signature Bank. He previously served {{as a member of the}} U.S. House of Representatives from Massachusetts from 1981 to 2013. As a member of the Democratic Party, he served as chairman of the House Financial Services Committee (2007–2011) and was a leading co-sponsor of the 2010 Dodd–Frank Act, <b>a</b> <b>sweeping</b> reform of the U.S. financial industry. Frank, a resident of Newton, Massachusetts, is considered the most prominent gay politician in the United States.|$|E
5|$|By 1809 the territory's {{population}} had climbed to over 20,000. Congress passed legislation {{that allowed the}} Indiana Territory to elect a bicameral legislature and made the Legislative Council the upper house It also ordered Harrison to dissolve the existing one and created the Illinois Territory. The effect of these actions, was to cut the pro-slavery faction remaining in the Indiana Territory in half. The election resulted in <b>a</b> <b>sweeping</b> victory for the anti-slavery party. The new assembly quickly passed legislation revoking the indentured servitude laws of 1803, and introduced legislation to prevent its reintroduction. They also passed laws aimed at preventing slave hunters from removing escaped slaves from the state.|$|E

5|$|Health care in Turkey {{used to be}} {{dominated}} by a centralised state system run by the Ministry of Health. In 2003, the government introduced <b>a</b> <b>sweeping</b> health reform programme aimed at increasing the ratio of private to state health provision and making healthcare available to a larger share of the population. Turkish Statistical Institute announced that 76.3 billion TL was spent for healthcare in 2012; 79.6 percent of which was covered by the Social Security Institution and 15.4 percent of which was paid directly by the patients. In 2012, there were 29,960 medical institutions in Turkey, and on average one doctor per 583 people and 2.65 beds per 1000 people.|$|E
5|$|On July 1, 1922, 400,000 {{railroad}} workers went on strike. Harding {{proposed a}} settlement that made some concessions, but management objected. Attorney General Daugherty convinced Judge James H. Wilkerson to issue <b>a</b> <b>sweeping</b> injunction {{to break up}} the strike. Although there was public support for the Wilkerson injunction, Harding felt it went too far, and had Daugherty and Wilkerson amend it. The injunction succeeded in ending the strike; however, tensions remained high between railroad workers and management for years.|$|E

5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 led to public {{skepticism about the}} free market consensus even from some on the economic right. In March 2008, Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Financial Times, announced {{the death of the}} dream of global free-market capitalism. In the same month macroeconomist James K. Galbraith used the 25th Annual Milton Friedman Distinguished Lecture to launch <b>a</b> <b>sweeping</b> attack against the consensus for monetarist economics and argued that Keynesian economics were far more relevant for tackling the emerging crises.|$|E
5|$|By July 1944, Oppenheimer had {{concluded}} plutonium {{could not be}} used in a gun design, and opted for implosion. The accelerated effort on an implosion design, codenamed Fat Man, began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented <b>a</b> <b>sweeping</b> reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion. Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for explosives) Division headed by explosives expert George Kistiakowsky and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher. The new design that von Neumann and T (for theoretical) Division, most notably Rudolf Peierls, had devised used explosive lenses to focus the explosion onto a spherical shape using a combination of both slow and fast high explosives.|$|E

Although Teller was head of the T-1 (Implosion and Super) Group, Bethe considered that Teller was spending too much time on the Super, which had been given a low priority by Bethe and Oppenheimer. In June 1944, Oppenheimer created a dedicated Super Group under Teller, who was made directly responsible to Oppenheimer, and Peierls became head of the T-1 (Implosion) Group. In September, Teller's group became the F-1 (Super and General Theory) Group, part of the Enrico Fermi's new F (Fermi) Division.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his term}} in office, Combs was {{appointed}} to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals by President Johnson. He served for three years before resigning and running for governor again in 1971. He lost in the Democratic primary to Wendell Ford, his former executive secretary. In 1984, Combs agreed to represent sixty-six of the state's poor school districts in a lawsuit challenging the state's system of financing public education. The suit, Rose v. Council for Better Education, resulted in the Kentucky Supreme Court declaring the state's entire system of public schools unconstitutional. In response, the Kentucky General Assembly drafted <b>a</b> <b>sweeping</b> education measure known as the Kentucky Education Reform Act in 1991. On December 3, 1991, Combs was caught in a flash flood while driving and was killed.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 England {{first used}} a skin-tight strip. This was {{intended}} {{to make it more}} difficult for the opposition to grasp the shirt when tackling. The home and away strips for 2007 were unveiled on 15 May that year. The materials used are superior, offering improved performance to the 2003 kit. However, <b>a</b> <b>sweeping</b> red mark on the base-white front which forms St George's Cross on the top left, and a changed away-strip (dark blue to red), have received criticism because it is felt that emphasis has been placed on St George's Cross at the expense of the traditional red rose. The new strip was introduced in England's home game against Wales on 4 August, while the alternative strip was first used against France on 18 August.|$|E
5|$|The first {{landmark}} as {{the highway}} approaches downtown Mackinac Island is the island's public school building. As it passes the island's public library on the shoreline {{side of the}} street, Main Street makes <b>a</b> <b>sweeping</b> curve to the north at Windermere, or Biddle's, Point to run through the downtown district. Other than the library, most of the city's public buildings are actually situated along Market Street, one block behind Main Street. Three streets and a city park allow for connections between Main and Market streets. M-185 through downtown Mackinac Island passes through the major business district, featuring dozens of shops, restaurants and lodging establishments; nearly a dozen of these outlets feature the authentic Mackinac Island fudge made fresh daily during tourist season. The passenger ferry docks are all situated along Main Street in the downtown area. At the northeastern end of the downtown district, Main Street intersects Fort Street at the state park visitor center to complete its circuit of Mackinac Island.|$|E

5|$|After having scouted the Russian fortifications at Grodno, Charles {{realized}} {{a frontal}} assault would be impossible. At the same time, the Russians {{would not let}} themselves be provoked out into the field. Charles instead decided to try and starve them out by crossing the Neman river in January 15, encircling the city from the east, forcing 15,000 Russian cavalry to withdraw. In doing this he blocked the Russian communication lines, and also cut off their resources and supplies. Smaller Swedish parties were sent towards Vilnius {{in order to prevent}} General Christian Felix Bauer from supplying the trapped Russians. One of these, commanded by Jan Kazimierz Sapieha and Józef Potocki managed to beat 3,000 Russians at the Battle of Olita on February 9. Meanwhile, on February 7 Schulenburg had received word of Charles' crossing of the Vistula, and begun his march with the Saxon army in order to beat Rehnskiöld's smaller force near Poznań. Rehnskiöld, however, did not wait to be defeated and instead strove to engage Schulenburg before the arrival of Augustus 8,000 men. By using a daring feint Rehnskiöld managed to lure Schulenburg into a more disadvantageous position near Wschowa (Fraustadt), where the two armies clashed on February 13. Here, the Swedish general won a decisive victory killing or capturing up to 75% of Schulenburg's force. Crippled by this setback, the main Saxon army {{had no choice but to}} retreat. The whole allied plan collapsed, as the opportunity for the allies to destroy Charles' army in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth with <b>a</b> <b>sweeping</b> movement from behind, vanished.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel, however, {{was still}} {{disappointed}} with the failure to destroy the Turkish army. The Turks had fought hard, forcing {{the commitment of the}} Desert Mounted Corps in heavy action before the moment for <b>a</b> <b>sweeping</b> pursuit came. When it did, the men and horses were too tired and could not summon the required energy. In February 1918, the EEF began a series of operations across the Jordan. Allenby soon found his British troops diverted to France, to be replaced by two Indian cavalry divisions, and the Australian Mounted Division faced a similar fate for a time. In the meantime, during the second Transjordan operations Chauvel faced great difficulties with the terrain, the weather and a tenacious enemy; the campaign was not a success. The Desert Mounted Corps found itself fighting outnumbered, with Turkish reinforcements closing in from all sides. Chauvel was forced to withdraw to the West Bank of the Jordan. Subsequently, the 5th Yeomanry Mounted Brigade was disbanded and Chauvel replaced it with the 5th Light Horse Brigade, formed from the Australian and New Zealand components of the now disbanded Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, and a composite French cavalry regiment of Spahis and Chasseurs d'Afrique.|$|E
5|$|Kenney assumed {{command of}} the Allied Air Forces on 4 August. Three days later, he instituted <b>a</b> <b>sweeping</b> {{reorganization}} of the Allied Air Forces. The Australian components were assigned to RAAF Command under Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, while the American components were consolidated into the reformed Fifth Air Force under Kenney's personal command. On paper, the organization followed the orthodox pattern, consisting of V Fighter Command under Brigadier General Paul Wurtsmith, V Bomber Command under Walker, and an Air Services Command under Major General Rush B. Lincoln. But Kenney realized {{that he would have}} to maintain his headquarters near MacArthur's GHQ, which moved to Brisbane on 20 July, while the fighting was thousands of miles away in New Guinea, with the Fifth Air Force's principal forward bases around Port Moresby. Moreover, Walker's headquarters was in Townsville, as heavy and medium bombers were based there and only staged through Port Moresby. Accordingly, Kenney appointed Whitehead as deputy Fifth Air Force commander, and commander of the Advanced Echelon (ADVON) in Port Moresby.|$|E
