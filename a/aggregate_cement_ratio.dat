A self compacting concrete and a normally compacting concrete (NCC) with similar ultimate compressive strength were developed. The concrete cubes were tested at 7, 28, 60, 90, 120 and 150 days after normal water curing. For each case 10 samples were tested and the test results were recorded for each sample on as obtained basis. To predict strength characteristics four input parameters namely water cement ratio, <b>aggregate</b> <b>cement</b> <b>ratio,</b> percentage of fibers and aspect ratio were identified. The results of the present investigation indicate that Genetic Algorithm based Artificial Neural Network (GANN) has strong potential as a feasible tool for predicting strength characteristics of steel fibre reinforced concrete...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} {{the influence of}} fine aggregate and coarse aggregate quantities on the properties of pervious concrete. Materials used are OPC Type I, fine aggregate corresponding to grading II and four sizes of coarse aggregate namely, 4. 75 mm to 9 mm, 9 mm to 12. 5 mm, 12. 5 mm to 16 mm, 16 mm to 19. 5 mm. Mixes were prepared with the water cement ratio of 0. 34, cement content of 400 kg/m 3 and maintaining the <b>aggregate</b> <b>cement</b> <b>ratio</b> as 4. 75 : 1. Fine aggregate was replaced with coarse aggregate {{in the range of}} 50 - 100 % by weight. Various mechanical properties of the mixes were evaluated. Coefficient of permeability was determined by using falling head permeability method. The relationship between the strength, abrasion resistance, permeability and total void present in aggregate based on angularity number has been developed. Suitability of pervious concrete as a pavement material is discussed...|$|E

All the mixtures were proportioned with a fixed aggregate / cement ratio of 4. 5. Based on the experimental results, the flexural strength and the compressive strength of the PCPBs were calculated by considering the predictor variables (water cement ratio, curing age and plastic content). Equations derived based on the results from the experimental work are proposed to predict the flexural strength and the compressive strength of the developed PCPBs. The effect of water cement ratio, curing age and plastic content on flexural strength and compressive strength of PCPBs was found to be statistically significant (P < 0. 0001). The equations are only capable of predicting the flexural strength and the compressive strength of plastic concrete products, if the w/c ratio, the curing age and the <b>aggregate</b> <b>cement</b> <b>ratio</b> used are within the tested range...|$|E
40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{of reinforcement}} bars and prestressing strands in concrete structures {{is a significant}} issue in coastal environments. The conventional wisdom is that time to initiation of such corrosion is governed by the rate of diffusion of chlorides and other aggressive species to the reinforcement. However, the rate of reinforcement corrosion is not significantly affected {{by the presence of}} chlorides. A review is given of recent observations of the lack of serious reinforcement corrosion for some older structures in marine environments. These and new experimental results for concretes in actual seawater exposures show that the time to initiation of corrosion of reinforcement is delayed for concretes with high calcium carbonate content. Observations from on-gong experimental investigations for the effect of low heat <b>cement,</b> water and <b>aggregate</b> <b>cement</b> <b>ratios</b> and the level of salinity of salt water in the concrete mix also are presented...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} enhance the CO 2 curing {{efficiency}} of concrete block prepared with recycled aggregates, several material characteristics of the concrete block including moisture content, bulk density, <b>aggregate</b> to <b>cement</b> <b>ratio,</b> recycled <b>aggregate</b> content and types of binders, were studied experimentally to assess their effects on the CO 2 curing process. The results indicated that, during 2 h of CO 2 curing period, the moisture content and <b>aggregate</b> to <b>cement</b> <b>ratio</b> of the prepared blocks had significant effects on the CO 2 curing degree and the compressive strength. Appropriate pre-drying of the block specimens before CO 2 curing enabled the maximum curing degree, and the compressive strength attained was comparable or superior {{to that of the}} 6 h steam cured blocks. The bulk density and recycled aggregate content of the prepared blocks would also influence the CO 2 curing degree, but their effects on compressive strength were more complex. It was confirmed that the presence of recycled aggregate in the concrete blocks can promote the CO 2 curing efficiency. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|The {{strength}} {{development in}} concrete with its age {{is essentially a}} constant volume solidification process, which is controlled by multivarious parameters. However, the concrete mixes are designed for 28 day’s target compressive strength. In a more general characterization, {{it can be said}} that increase in strength of concrete is achieved by decrease in water cement ratio and decrease in <b>aggregate</b> <b>cement</b> <b>ratio.</b> However, it is impossible to develop a precise mathematical model that can predict crisp numerical values of strength that correspond to crisp values of w/c ratio and a/c ratio. This is due to uncertainties involved in these parameters, the uncertain behavior of constituent materials, and tolerances. The potential of fuzzy logic in developing a model for characterization by approximate reasoning really lies here. This paper presents a modest attempt made to characterize 28 day’s strength of concrete using Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). The methodology consists of two steps; (1) developing the basic model using generalized Abram’s law and (2) validating the basic model, using the experimental data. The water-cement ratio and aggregate-cement ratio are treated as antecedents and 28 day’s strength is the consequent. The results have shown that, the fuzzy inference system provides a prudent way to capture uncertainty (non-statistical) in relationships among parameters that control the early strength of concrete...|$|E
40|$|Estimation of creep and {{shrinkage}} {{are critical}} {{in order to}} compute loss of prestress with {{time in order to}} compute leak tightness and assess safety margins available in containment structures of nuclear power plants. Short-term creep and shrinkage experiments have been conducted using in-house test facilities developed specifically for the present research program on 35 and 45 MPa normal concrete and 25 MPa heavy density concrete. The extensive experimental program for creep, has cylinders subject to sustained levels of load typically for several days duration (till negligible strain increase with time is observed in the creep specimen), to provide the total creep strain versus time curves for the two normal density concrete grades and one heavy density concrete grade at different load levels, different ages at loading, and at different relative humidity’s. Shrinkage studies on prism specimen for concrete of the same mix grades are also being studied. In the first instance, creep and shrinkage prediction models reported in the literature has been used to predict the creep and shrinkage levels in subsequent experimental data with acceptable accuracy. While macro-scale short experiments and analytical model development to estimate time dependent deformation under sustained loads over long term, accounting for the composite rheology through the influence of parameters such as the characteristic strength, age of concrete at loading, relative humidity, temperature, mix proportion (cement: fine aggregate: coarse aggregate: water) and volume to surface ratio and the associated uncertainties in these variables form one part of the study, it is widely believed that strength, early age rheology, creep and shrinkage are affected by the material properties at the nano-scale that are not well established. In order to understand and improve cement and concrete properties, investigation of the nanostructure of the composite and how it relates to the local mechanical properties is being undertaken. While results of creep and shrinkage obtained at macro-scale and their predictions through rheological modeling are satisfactory, the nano and micro indenting experimental and analytical studies are presently underway. Computational mechanics based models for creep and shrinkage in concrete must necessarily account for numerous parameters that impact their short and long term response. A Kelvin type model with several elements representing the influence of various factors that impact the behaviour is under development. The immediate short term deformation (elastic response), effects of relative humidity and temperature, volume to surface ratio, water cement ratio and <b>aggregate</b> <b>cement</b> <b>ratio,</b> load levels and age of concrete at loading are parameters accounted for in this model. Inputs to this model, such as the pore structure and mechanical properties at micro/nano scale have been taken from scanning electron microscopy and micro/nano-indenting of the sample specimen...|$|E
40|$|With an {{increasing}} interest in recycling and reusing waste, {{there is a}} need to carry out research on exploring ways to transform industrial wastes into construction materials. This paper attempts to explore the feasibility of reutilizing textile effluent sludge (TES) for producing concrete blocks with a pretreatment step. The lime-based pretreatment process was adopted to remove ammonia in TES which had been found to lead to bad odor and strength loss of the concrete blocks. The concrete blocks were prepared with an <b>aggregate</b> to <b>cement</b> <b>ratio</b> of 12, 10 and 6. The pretreated TES was adopted to replace the fine aggregate at a mass ratio ranging from 0 % to 30 %. The compressive strength and drying shrinkage values were determined to evaluate the performance of concrete blocks containing TES. The results indicated that the lime-based pretreatment process can lower the ammonia concentration in TES significantly. The concrete blocks with a lower TES content and lower ammonia concentration had higher compressive strength and better volume stability. When the TES content in the concrete blocks was about 10 %, the concrete blocks with an <b>aggregate</b> to <b>cement</b> <b>ratio</b> of 10 can satisfy the minimum strength requirement for non-load bearing applications. Meanwhile, the result of leaching test indicated that the toxic trace metals present in textile effluent sludge could be stabilized/solidified and metal leaching from the concrete blocks is not a concern.

40|$|The use of {{permeable}} concrete in {{the construction}} industry has been increasing around the world during the last few years. The fundamental properties of permeable concrete must thus be comprehensively evaluated and elucidated in order to obtain the full benefits of this material. This research investigated the effects of material composition on the mechanical properties (compressive strength, stress-strain behaviour and the modulus of elasticity) and on the hydraulic properties (porosity ratio and permeability) of the permeable concrete. Eight different permeable concrete mix designs were prepared with two aggregate sizes in two different proportions, different sand <b>ratios,</b> two <b>aggregate</b> to <b>cement</b> <b>ratios</b> and a constant water to <b>cement</b> <b>ratio.</b> The target 28 -day compressive strength was designed to be between 15 MPa and 35 MPa. The porosity ratio was designed to be between 25 % and 15 %, whilst the permeability was designed to be between 12 mm/sec to 2 mm/sec. A review of the published literature revealed no standard experimental procedure for determining the stress-strain behaviour and the modulus of elasticity of permeable concrete using the strain gauge method. The only method in use was the platen-to-platen method. This research involved the development of a testing method for determining these properties using the strain gauge method. The results are compared with those that were obtained using the platen-to-platen method. A significant difference was found between the properties that were measured by these two methods. A semi-empirical equation to represent the complete stress-strain behaviour for unconfined permeable concrete is proposed as part of this research. Various existing models for low-strength concrete and normal-strength concrete were used and compared with the experimental data. Various parameters were studied and their relationships were experimentally determined. The only parameters needed to run the new model is the ultimate compressive strength and the density. The proposed semi-empirical stress-strain equations were compared with actual cylinder tests results under axial compression; the new model gives a good representation of the mean behaviour of the actual stress-strain response of the permeable concrete. ...|$|R

Thus, in this research, experimental investigations are performed in order to study the beneficial use of CO₂ curing for producing concrete blocks prepared with recycled aggregates. The work conducted in this research program was consisted of three main phases. The work in Phase I was to explore the feasibility of using the CO₂ curing technique for the production of concrete blocks containing recycled aggregates. Recycled fine aggregates collected from a local recycling plant was used to replace the natural fine aggregate in concrete blocks. The CO₂ curing process was performed with a duration of 6 h, 12 h and 24 h, under the pressure of + 0. 1 bar. The experimental results proved that CO₂ curing process rendered the concrete blocks prepared with recycled aggregates with higher compressive strength and lower drying shrinkage than the corresponding moist cured blocks. However, curing time and amount of recycled aggregate present in the blocks had insignificant effects on the strength gain and CO₂ curing degree. The study in Phase II, mainly focused on evaluating several important factors that might influence the CO₂ curing process of concrete blocks made with recycled aggregates. There were two parts including materials characteristic and curing regime. In part 1, the effects of materials characteristics of the concrete block on CO₂ curing process were investigated, including moisture content, bulk density, <b>aggregate</b> to <b>cement</b> <b>ratio,</b> recycled <b>aggregate</b> content and types of binders. The results showed that, the initial moisture content and the <b>aggregate</b> to <b>cement</b> <b>ratio</b> in the concrete blocks significantly affected the CO 2 curing degree and compressive strength of the concrete blocks. The bulk density and the recycled aggregate content also influenced the CO₂ curing process, but their effects on compressive strength were more complex. The work in this part further confirmed that the inclusion of recycled aggregates can improve the CO₂ curing efficiency. In part 2, the influence of several factors associated with the curing conditions on the curing degree and compressive strength of the concrete blocks were investigated, including curing time, temperature, relative humidity, pressure and post water curing after the pressurized CO₂ curing (PCC) method was employed. An experiment with flow-through CO₂ curing (FCC) method was also carried out. The results of PCC experiments showed that high percentage of the total considerable curing degree and compressive strength were attained during the first 2 hours of CO₂ curing period, and extending the curing time yielded slower gain of curing degree and compressive strength; the variation of temperature from 20 ℃ to 80 ℃ and relative humidity from 50 % to 80 % had limited effects on PCC; the effects of CO₂ gas pressure on the curing degree and compressive strength were the most pronounced between 0. 1 bar and 0. 5 bar within the first 2 hours of PCC; the post water curing allowed the concrete blocks to attain further strength gain. The results also indicated that, a lower curing degree and slower strength development at the early age were observed for the FCC-cured concrete blocks; however, after 24 hours of curing duration, they were comparable to those obtained from the PCC method. In Phase III, the intrinsic mechanism for rapid strength development of the CO₂-cured cement-based materials was studied, and the chemical and microstructural evolution of cement paste subjected to coupled CO₂- water curing was investigated. These was achieved through identifying the phase variations, change in porosity and morphological evolution of the structure of CSH gel. The results indicated that more than 2 hrs of CO₂ curing might lead to a lower long term strength development after the subsequent hydration period. The results of the solid state ²⁹Si MAS NMR showed that the CO₂ curing process can remove calcium ions from the interlayer of CSH, and promote the merging of dimers into polymers; and thus the formed CSH had a longer silicate chain length and a higher degree of polymerization. This is regarded as the main reason for the rapid strength development of the cement paste at the early age when subjected to the CO₂ curing process.

It has been found that the mechanical properties of the similar materials extremely depend on the proportioning ratio, and they satisfy the requirements of different laboratory {{physical simulation}} tests with similar materials. In addition, the compression strength and elastic modulus of the similar material decrease as the sand–binder <b>ratio</b> or <b>cement</b> <b>ratio</b> increases. The relation between the sand–binder ratio and compression strength of the material and that between the sand–binder ratio and elastic modulus are linear. Meanwhile, the relation between the <b>cement</b> <b>ratio</b> and compression strength and that between the <b>cement</b> <b>ratio</b> and elastic modulus are both exponential. Sensitivity analysis using the range method shows that the effects of the <b>cement</b> <b>ratio</b> on the compression strength and elastic modulus are more significant than the effects of the sand–binder ratio.
