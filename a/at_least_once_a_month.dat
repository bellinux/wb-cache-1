5|$|The modern {{system of}} county courts in England and Wales {{dates from the}} County Courts Act 1846, which {{received}} Royal Assent on 28 August 1846 and was brought into force on 15 March 1847. England and Wales (with {{the exception of the}} City of London, which was outside the scope of the Act) were divided into 60 circuits, with a total of 491 courts. Four of these circuits were wholly in Wales, as were 46 of these courts. A further seven courts were located in Monmouthshire (which had at the time an ambiguous status and was sometimes treated as being part of England) and these seven courts were part of a circuit for Monmouthshire and Herefordshire. One county court judge was appointed to each circuit, assisted by one or more registrars with some limited judicial powers, and would travel between the courts in his area as necessary, sitting in each court <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> Few permanent courts were needed initially, given the infrequency of court hearings, and temporary accommodation such as a town hall would often be used where there was no existing courthouse for use.|$|E

Confessions are held <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> and some Urapmin keep lists of sins {{in order not to}} forget to confess them.

25|$|Hardy was {{released}} on licence in August 1919 upon successfully petitioning Lord French. His ticket of leave was signed by Ian Macpherson and allowed him to move freely as he wished, although he was mandated to report to a police station <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> He maintained a good character and caused the police no trouble even, he claims, becoming the editor of several religious publications in London.

25|$|The Supreme War Council was {{formally}} established on 7 November 1917, containing the Prime Minister and a Minister {{from each of}} the Western Front powers (i.e., excluding Russia), to meet <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> Foch (along with Wilson and Italian general Cadorna) were appointed military representatives, to whom the general staffs of each country were to submit their plans. The French tried to have Foch as representative to increase their control over the Western Front (by contrast Cadorna was disgraced after the recent Battle of Caporetto and Wilson, a personal friend of Foch, was deliberately appointed as a rival to Field Marshal Robertson, the British Chief of the Imperial General Staff, an ally of Haig's, who had recently lost 250,000 men at the battle of Ypres the same year.) Clemenceau was eventually persuaded to appoint Foch's protégé Weygand instead, although many already suspected that Foch would eventually become the Allied Generalissimo.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the turn}} of the millennium, the most notable success among newly minted midnight movies has been Donnie Darko (2001). Older films are also popular on the circuit, {{appreciated}} largely in an imposed camp fashion—a midnight movie tradition that goes back to the 1972 revival of the hectoring anti-drug movie Reefer Madness (1938). (Tod Browning's 1932 horror classic Freaks, the original midnight movie revival, is both too dark and too sociologically acute to readily consume as camp.) Where the irony with which Reefer Madness was adopted as a midnight favorite had its roots in a countercultural sensibility, in the latter's place there is now the parodoxical element of nostalgia: the leading revivals on the circuit currently include the crème de la crème of the John Hughes oeuvre—The Breakfast Club (1985), Pretty in Pink (1986), and Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986)—and the preteen adventure film The Goonies (1985). As of late 2006, Rocky Horror itself continues to play on a weekly basis at thirty-two venues around the country, and <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> at about two dozen others.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{the trade}} {{commission}} should speak out regarding {{the issues raised}} by the member states regarding application and compliance with common offshore tariffs and other common trade policy instruments. The commission shall meet <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> as well as whenever asked to by the Mercosur executive agency or by a member state. The commission can take decisions entailing administration and application of trade policies adopted under Southern Common Market, and whenever necessary submit proposals to the executive body regarding regulation of the areas under its authority; additionally, it can propose new guidelines or modify those in existence in Mercosur trade and customs matters. In this respect, the trade commission can propose a change in the import duty on specific items under common external tariffs, including cases referring to development of new Mercosur production activities. To better achieve its objectives, the trade commission can create technical committees targeting direction and supervision of the work it engages in. It can also adopt internal operating regulations. Proposals and decisions of the trade commission will be taken by a consensus of the representatives indicated by each member nation. Any disputes ensuing from the application, interpretation or compliance with the acts issued by the trade commission are referred to the Mercosur executive body, and should be resolved using the directives set forth in the Dispute Resolution System adopted under Southern Common Market.|$|E

[...] When Speer invented the concept of his [...] "world wide walk", imagining his daily exercise around the prison yard to be segments in a long walk from Europe through Asia to North America, Wolters supplied Speer with details of what he would [...] "see". [...] Speer later stated, [...] "In a manner of speaking, Rudi Wolters accompanied me on these walks." [...] As midnight struck and October 1, 1966 began, Speer was released from Spandau Prison. [...] His last use of the clandestine message system was to have a telegram sent to Wolters, in which Speer jokingly asked Wolters to pick him up thirty-fivekilometres south of Guadalajara, Mexico, which he had [...] "reached" [...] after walking 31,936kilometres.|$|E
500|$|The Lion King was {{the first}} Disney {{animated}} feature to be an original story, rather than be based on an already existing work. The filmmakers {{have said that the}} story of The Lion King was inspired by the lives of Joseph and Moses, from the Bible, and William Shakespeare's Hamlet. During the summer of 1992, the team was joined by screenwriter Irene Mecchi, with a second screenwriter, Jonathan Roberts, joining a few months later. Mecchi and Roberts took charge of the revision process, fixing unresolved emotional issues in the script and adding comic business for Pumbaa, Timon, and the hyenas. [...] Lyricist Tim Rice worked closely with the writing team, flying to California <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> because his songs needed to work in the narrative continuity. Rice's lyrics—which were reworked up to the production's end—were pinned to the storyboards during development. Rewrites were frequent, with animator Andreas Deja saying that completed scenes would be delivered, only for the response to be that parts needed to be reanimated because of dialog changes.|$|E
500|$|The {{county court}} system in England and Wales {{dates back to}} the County Courts Act 1846, which {{received}} Royal Assent on 28 August 1846 and was brought into force on 15 March 1847. England and Wales (with the exception of the City of London, which was outside the scope of the Act) were divided into 60 circuits, with a total of 491 county courts within these circuits. The then Lord Chancellor, Lord Cottenham, wanted everyone to be within seven miles of a court, and the final scheme came close to that aim. One county court judge was appointed to each circuit, assisted by one or more registrars with some limited judicial powers, and would travel between the courts in his area as necessary, sitting in each court <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> Few permanent courts were needed initially, given the infrequency of court hearings, and temporary accommodation such as a town hall would often be used where there was no existing courthouse for use. In some places, a building is now shared with the local Crown Court (as at Maidstone Combined Court Centre, for example), Family Court, or magistrates' court. The judicial business of the county courts is now carried out by circuit judges (a term introduced by the Courts Act 1971) and district judges (as the post of registrar was renamed by section 74 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990). Part-time judges (recorders, deputy district judges and some retired judges) also sit in the county court. [...] As at 1April 2015, there are 640 circuit judges and 441 district judges.|$|E
