6000|$|... "Well," [...] he declared, [...] "though {{you may be}} {{astonished}} to hear it, I'm sorry. Unfortunately, our interests clashed, and I naturally looked after mine. Once upon a time I thought I could have worked {{hand in hand with}} Vane, but our ideas did not coincide, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> is not the man to yield a point or listen to advice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said a bystander. [...] "He's game enough, and I'd ask {{the boys}} to my funeral if I meant to drive him at night over the lake trail.

6000|$|The girl laughed. [...] "Well," [...] she said, [...] "most of {{the folks}} in this {{province}} who read newspapers have.

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it is also}} {{important}} to remember that <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> will be using the same strategy in their bidding; <b>and</b> therefore, if <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> bids six hearts, for example, you may not necessarily want to bid eight hearts simply because you have two cards of the proposed trump suit in your hand.|$|R
6000|$|She {{pressed it}} to her {{innocent}} breast at that. And had he really done so? and {{which was the first}} time, and the second, and the third? Oh, dear glove, you know so much, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> lies at home in a drawer knowing nothing. Grizel felt sorry for the other glove.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} latter, [...] "if I {{had a little}} more to go upon, I might make quite a serious thing out of this. As it is, all I'm very sure about is that you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> conspired to prevent the troopers getting at Tomlinson; but as Tomlinson didn't kill Probyn, that doesn't count for so much, after all. Still, we have no use for you up here just now, and you have two days in which to clear out of the valley. Tomlinson will get his ticket, too, when he's able to take the trail." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, look here, Amateur, it ain't for {{a fireman}} to go here and there, {{trying to defend}} them as have started a blaze; but I wouldn't wonder if we could find some lawyer {{to take charge of}} his case. Perhaps we can get him off on the same plea you're using now--that it would serve to make a {{criminal}} of him, rather than work the proper kind of reformation. There'll be plenty of time, lad, because you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> are bound to be called on as witnesses even on the preliminary examination, so until the officers find you two nothing can be done, for I don't reckon your imitation detective has any knowledge of what happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Michael Tomasello, the key {{cognitive}} capacity distinguishing Homo sapiens {{from our}} ape cousins is [...] "intersubjectivity". This entails turn-taking <b>and</b> role-reversal: <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> strives {{to read your}} mind, you simultaneously strive to read theirs, and each of you makes {{a conscious effort to}} assist the other in the process. The outcome is that each partner forms a representation of the other's mind in which their own can be discerned by reflection.|$|R

6000|$|Hard {{work and}} excitement? Let the wind baffle and drop {{in a heavy}} tide- way just as you are sailing your little sloop through a narrow draw-bridge. Behold your sails, upon which you are depending, flap with sudden emptiness, and then see the impish wind, with a haul of eight points, fill your jib aback with a gusty puff. Around she goes, and sweeps, not through the open draw, but {{broadside}} on against the solid piles. Hear {{the roar of the}} tide, sucking through the trestle. And hear and see your pretty, fresh-painted boat crash against the piles. Feel her stout little hull give to the impact. See the rail actually pinch in. Hear your canvas tearing, and see the black, square-ended timbers thrusting holes through it. Smash! There goes your topmast stay, and the topmast reels over drunkenly above you. There is a ripping and crunching. If it continues, your starboard shrouds will be torn out. Grab a rope--any rope--and take a turn around a pile. But the free end of the rope is too short. You can't make it fast, and you hold on and wildly yell for your one companion to get a turn with another and longer rope. Hold on! You hold on till you are purple in the face, till it seems your arms are dragging out of their sockets, till the blood bursts from the ends of your fingers. But you hold, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> gets the longer rope and makes it fast. You straighten up and look at your hands. They are ruined. You can scarcely relax the crooks of the fingers. The pain is sickening. But there is no time. The skiff, which is always perverse, is pounding against the barnacles on the piles which threaten to scrape its gunwale off. It's drop the peak! Down jib! Then you run lines, and pull and haul and heave, and exchange unpleasant remarks with the bridge-tender who is always willing to meet you more than half way in such repartee. And finally, {{at the end of an}} hour, with aching back, sweat-soaked shirt, and slaughtered hands, you are through and swinging along on the placid, beneficent tide between narrow banks where the cattle stand knee-deep and gaze wonderingly at you. Excitement! Work! Can you beat it in a calm day on the deep sea? ...|$|E

'I tell you in fair terms, Joshua Geddes, that you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>partners</b> are using unlawful craft to destroy {{the fish in the}} Solway by stake-nets and wears; and that we, who fish fairly, and like men, as our fathers did, have daily and yearly less sport and less profit. Do not think gravity or hypocrisy can carry it off as you have done. The world knows you, and we know you. You will destroy the salmon which makes the livelihood of fifty poor families, <b>and</b> then wipe <b>your</b> mouth, <b>and</b> go to make a speech at meeting. But do not hope it will last thus. I give you fair warning, we will be upon you one morning soon, when we will not leave a stake standing in the pools of the Solway; and down the tide they shall every one go, and well if we do not send a lessee along with them.' ...|$|R
