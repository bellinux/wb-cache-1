25|$|In {{the past}} most agunah cases {{were due to}} a husband dying without leaving clear {{evidence}} of his demise, or becoming mentally ill (insane). Nowadays many agunah cases arise {{as a result of}} a husband withholding a get, perhaps seeking a more favorable divorce settlement, or out of vindictiveness. In response agunah groups have organized to support these women <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a solution to this problem. Various remedies have been proposed, but as yet, no one solution has common acceptance. Nevertheless, the Prenuptial Agreement for the Prevention of Get-Refusal is one remedy which is in use in Modern Orthodox Jewish communities worldwide and is accepted by moderate halakhic authorities.|$|E

Jagland wanted to improve foreign aid to Yugoslavia <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a {{peaceful}} solution to the Yugoslav wars. Jagland engineered financial and material support to the forces in Yugoslavia who were opposed to Slobodan Milosevic, a move that increased {{the popularity of the}} opposition to Milosevic and his eventual fall from power. The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs furnished computers that helped in revealing the electoral fraud perpetrated by Milosevic. The Norwegian contribution was instrumental in the overthrow of the Milosevic government and Jagland was the first to be invited to the victory celebrations.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Apple's newest CEO, Gil Amelio, poached Ellen Hancock from National Semiconductor {{and put her}} {{in charge}} of {{engineering}} in an effort to try to get development back on track. She decided it was best to cancel the project outright <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a suitable third-party system to replace it. Development of Copland officially ended in August 1996. After a short search, Apple announced its purchase of NeXT in order to use its NeXTSTEP operating system as the basis of a new Mac OS. Hancock also suggested that Apple should work on improving the existing System 7 while the new system matured. This was released as Mac OS 8 in 1997 and was followed by Mac OS 9 in 1999. The new operating system based on NeXTSTEP shipped in 2001 as Mac OS X.|$|E

2500|$|So serial {{thinking}} is something that's {{come into our}} consciousness and will be there forever: it's relativity and nothing else.

It's a spiritual and democratic attitude toward the world. The stars are organized in a serial way.

If we more thoroughly studied the distances and proportions of the stars we'd probably find certain relationships of multiples based on some logarithmic scale or whatever the scale may be.|$|E

However he goes on to affirm a moderate form of religious pluralism, and holds that Orthodox Jews must accept that non-Orthodox rabbis are valid Jewish leaders, and possess spiritual dignity. [...] He holds that marriages that are officiated at by non-Orthodox Jews can be halakhically valid, but not so non-Orthodox divorces. Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews must find ways to work together.|$|E

2500|$|As {{it turned}} out, the de Medici {{libretto}} {{was rejected by}} the Teatro Argentina and I due Foscari was substituted. This gave Verdi the opportunity to re-read Byron's play and, in doing so, he came to the realization (which he expressed in a letter to Piave) that the librettist had better NOT 'stick close to Byron': [...] "...the play does not quite have the theatrical grandeur needed for an opera; so rack your brains <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> something which will make a bit of a splash particularly in the first act" [...] and he continues by stressing that [...] "it's a fine subject, delicate and full of pathos"." [...] Thus, the rather lower key of the original piece stood out in direct contrast to the opera by which it was succeeded. However, as musicologist Roger Parker notes, it appears that Verdi was [...] "concentrating on personal confrontations rather than grand scenic effects".|$|E

Health psychologists use their knowledge of psychology and health to promote general well-being and understand physical illness.

Health psychologists work with many different health care professionals (e.g., physicians, dentists, nurses, physician's assistants, dietitians, social workers, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists, and chaplains) to conduct research and provide clinical assessments and treatment services. Many health psychologists focus on prevention research and interventions designed to promote healthier lifestyles <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> ways {{to encourage people to}} improve their health.
