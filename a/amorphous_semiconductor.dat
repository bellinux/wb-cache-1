The optical and electronic properties of the films have been studied by conventional spectroscope, photoluminescence and photoconductance techniques etc. Some anomalous phenomena, such as, the quantum size effect and the permenent photoconductivity (PPC) effect, have been discovered [1 – 2]. Recently the investigations of the characteristics and parameters of <b>amorphous</b> <b>semiconductor</b> superlattice films by photoacoustic and photothermal techniques are being got attention [3, 4]. In this paper, we describe {{the study of the}} thermal diffusivity of a series samples of <b>amorphous</b> <b>semiconductor</b> superlattices a-Si:H/a-SiNx:H. The thermal diffusivity of the samples is experimentally measured by using mirage detection technique [5, 6].

Specially it is available to measure directly the thermal parameters of thin films which are usually difficalt to be, evaluated. In the theoretical calculation, one dimensional model with “ the thormal resistors in series “ and ” the weighted average ” is used.

30|$|For {{the study}} of {{electrical}} transport in <b>amorphous</b> <b>semiconductors,</b> especially chalcogenide glasses, dc conductivity {{is one of the}} important parameters. The dc conductivity of chalcogenide glasses depends on the combination of starting components, synthesis conditions, rate of melt annealing, purity of starting components, thermal treatment, and on some other important factors. The electrical conduction process in <b>amorphous</b> <b>semiconductors</b> is generally governed by the three mechanisms namely (1) the transfer of charge carriers between delocalized states in the conduction band (E > Ec) and valence band (E < Ev), (2) transitions of charge carriers in the band tails, and (3) the hopping of charge carriers between delocalized states in bands near the Fermi level (EF). To explain the conduction mechanism in <b>amorphous</b> <b>semiconductors,</b> studies on temperature dependence of conductivity is reported by various workers [54 – 57]. It is understood that conduction in chalcogenide glasses is intrinsic [58, 59] and that the Fermi level is close to the midway of the energy gap. Intrinsic conduction of <b>amorphous</b> <b>semiconductors</b> is determined by carrier hopping from the states close {{to the edge of the}} valence band to localized states near the Fermi level or from the state near the Fermi level to the conduction band. The suitable conduction mechanism is decided depending on the predominant process. In the case of chalcogenide glasses, the Fermi level is somewhat shifted from the middle of the energy gap toward the valence band [60].|$|R
