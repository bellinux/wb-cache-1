So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E

25|$|The first {{electric}} headlamp {{light source}} was the tungsten filament, {{operating in a}} vacuum or inert-gas atmosphere inside the headlamp bulb or sealed beam. Compared to newer-technology light sources, tungsten filaments give off small amounts of light relative to the power they consume. Also, during normal operation of such lamps, tungsten boils off {{the surface of the}} filament and condenses on the bulb glass, blackening it. This reduces the light output of the filament and blocks some of the light that would pass through an unblackened bulb glass, though blackening was less of a problem in sealed beam units; their large interior surface area minimized the thickness of the tungsten accumulation. For these reasons, plain tungsten filaments <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> obsolete in automotive headlamp service.|$|E

Conversely, sea cucumbers, which are very common on the walls of Monterey Canyon, <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> absent on Davidson, an example of the polarity between Davidson and Monterey Bay.|$|E

500|$|David Browne, of Entertainment Weekly, {{noted that}} [...] "Tabloid Junkie," [...] comes as [...] "close to {{transcendence}} as {{anywhere on the}} album" [...] and described the chorus, [...] "Just because you {{read it in the}} magazine or see it on the TV screen don't make it factual" [...] as Jackson's [...] "grabbiest, most driven refrain in years." [...] Although Browne praised the song, he commented, [...] "The rest of the song, however, is mucked up with fake tabloid-TV snippets about his 'life,' and on the verses Jackson's delivery is so terse (he's not singing, he's harrumphing) that his lyrics <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> obliterated. Handed a golden opportunity, he throws it all away — but then, it wouldn't be the first time." [...] Deepika Reedy, of The Daily Collegian, described the [...] "rust in songs" [...] like [...] "Tabloid Junkie" [...] as having a [...] "raw aspect" [...] that Jackson [...] "hasn't approached since a near-miss with 'Billie Jean'." [...] Patrick Macdonald, of The Seattle Times, noted that [...] "Tabloid Junkie" [...] was a [...] "disingenuous attack on sensational news stories" [...] about Jackson, remarked that most of stories were [...] "planted" [...] by Jackson himself.|$|E
500|$|There are {{no records}} {{to support the}} {{reputation}} that Johnny Ringo developed. Of the documented instances where Ringo killed men, they were unarmed, {{and there is no}} evidence to support his participation in a single gunfight. Others deserved the reputation associated with them. Jim Courtright and Dallas Stoudenmire both killed several men in gunfights both as lawmen and as civilians. Clay Allison and Ben Thompson had well-deserved reputations. [...] At the same time, gunmen like Scott Cooley <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> unknown, when they actually led a life reflective of what most would consider a gunfighter to be. In other cases, certain gunfighters were possibly confused, over time, with being someone else with a similar name. The most well known of Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch gang, the Sundance Kid, was in reality only known to have been in one shootout during his lifetime, and no gunfights. Some historians have since stated that it is possible that over time he was confused with another Wild Bunch member, Kid Curry, who was without a doubt the most dangerous member of the gang, having killed many lawmen and civilians during his lifetime before being killed himself. Hence, it is the Sundance Kid who is better known.|$|E
500|$|Keenan {{rejoined the}} {{sessions}} in early 2003, {{and the music}} began taking a different direction with the new lineup and Keenan's influence. Beyond the new personnel, the dynamic had changed: With Mer de Noms, Howerdel had already written and finalized all of the music, with Keenan just contributing the lyrics and vocals. This time around, Keenan was more active in vetoing or altering musical ideas, determined to make something different than just another hard rock album, in fear of it being redundant. Sessions became tense, with Howerdel preferring the heavier compositions written while waiting for Keenan {{to return to the}} band, and sometimes taking offense to Keenan's suggested mellower rearrangements. White would play the role of a mediator between the two; being newer to the band helped him provide an outsider's perspective, helping them to find a common ground. The band released their second album, Thirteenth Step, on September 16, 2003. The album debuted even higher than Mer de Noms, charting at number 2 in its opening week and selling over 233,000 copies. [...] The album, and its accompanying new sound, fared well critically as well. The AllMusic review praised the bands new sound, describing it as [...] "moodier, tenser, and more atmospheric (if that is possible) recording than its predecessor...The wide dynamic swathes that were so prominent on the band's debut <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> absent here. The squalling guitars have taken a backseat to carefully crafted melodies where atmospherics are maximized and pulled taut over the listener. While not a radical departure from Mer de Noms, there is a real progression here.... Lyrically, musically, sonically, the Thirteenth Step is proof positive that mainstream rock has plenty of life and vision left in it." ...|$|E

[...] The South Shore Line, which runs from Chicago's Millennium Station to South Bend, Indiana, has been converted to modern electric rapid-transit operation on the dense corridor between Chicago and Gary, Indiana but still runs essentially as an interurban through several small towns between Gary and South Bend. Los Angeles has a light-rail system whose lines sometimes follow the routes of the area's interurbans, although this revival commenced decades after the original interurban ceased service.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} also {{the basis for a}} novel of the same name by George Gipe, {{published}} by Avon Books in June 1984. The novel offered an origin for mogwai and gremlins as a prologue. Supposedly, mogwai were created as gentle, contemplative creatures by a scientist on an alien world. However, it was discovered that their physiology was unstable. The end result was that only 1 in 10,000 mogwai would retain their sweet, loving demeanor. The rest would change into creatures that the novel referred to as [...] "mischievous". [...] The minority mogwai (the 1 in 10,000) <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> immortal by human standards, though Gizmo explains to Stripe that if he were to undergo the transformation himself, he would become like the others, [...] "short lived and violent." [...] This origin is unique to the novel but is referred to in the novelization of Gremlins 2 by David Bischoff. No definitive origin for mogwai or gremlins is given in either Gremlins film.|$|E
2500|$|Through their characters, our own {{behaviour}} is displayed. [...] Everyone holds {{firmly to}} {{the illusion of}} the authenticity of one's own desires; the novelists implacably expose all the diversity of lies, dissimulations, maneuvers, and the snobbery of the Proustian heroes; these <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> [...] "tricks of desire", which prevent one from facing the truth: envy and jealousy. These characters, desiring the being of the mediator, project upon him superhuman virtues {{while at the same}} time depreciating themselves, making him a god while making themselves slaves, in the measure that the mediator is an obstacle to them. [...] Some, pursuing this logic, come to seek the failures that are the signs of the proximity of the ideal to which they aspire. This can manifest as a heightened experience of the universal pseudo-masochism inherent in seeking the unattainable, which can, of course, turn into sadism should the actor play this part in reverse.|$|E
