40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{reasons for}} failure of pelvimetry to predict dystocia, we collected data from 1146 heifers and 210 cows in five beef cow herds in Saskatchewan. We assessed the reliability of pelvic <b>area</b> <b>measurements,</b> the generalizability of findings, various modifications of the technique, and the statistical association between pelvic <b>area</b> <b>measurements</b> and dystocia. The repeatability (kappa) of pelvic <b>area</b> <b>measurements</b> between and within veterinarians for the Rice and Krautmann pelvimeters were low to moderate, indicating pelvic <b>area</b> <b>measurements</b> were imprecise. The positive predictive values and sensitivities of pelvic <b>area</b> <b>measurements</b> were consistently poor across herds, years of study, breeds of heifers, times of <b>measurement,</b> various pelvic <b>area</b> cut-off points, and sires. Various modifications of the technique, including pelvic area/calf birth weight ratios, pelvic area/heifer weight ratios, and Ko's calving prediction equation were also poor on-farm tests for predicting dystocia. Although the mean pelvic area in heifers with dystocia was smaller than those without dystocia, {{there was a large}} overlap in the distribution of their measurements. Far too many heifers with a small pelvic area had no dystocia (false positives) and far too many heifers with a large pelvic area had dystocia (false negatives) for pelvimetry to be useful. We conclude there is little evidence to justify the continued use of pelvimetry as an on-farm test to reduce dystocia in beef cattle...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess reproducibility, {{expressed}} as both inter-observer variability and intra-observer variability, of fat <b>area</b> <b>measurements</b> on images obtained by magnetic resonance (MR); to compare variability between fat <b>area</b> <b>measurements,</b> calculated {{from a single}} image per body region and from the average fat area of three images, and to determine reproducibility of image acquisition at the abdominal level. SUBJECTS: Thirty young, non-obese subjects (reproducibility of image analysis) and nine young, non-obese subjects (reproducibility of image acquisition). METHODS: Three MR images {{at the level of}} the abdomen (in 30 subjects) and {{at the level of the}} hip and thigh (in 14 of them). Quantification of subcutaneous fat depots (abdomen, hip and thigh) and visceral fat depots using an image-analyzing computer program. Assessment of variability of image analysis for fat <b>area</b> <b>measurements</b> between two observers and within observers. Assessment of reproducibility of image acquisition at the abdominal level (in nine subjects). RESULTS: Subcutaneous fat areas in all body regions were quantified with coefficients of variation (CV) ranging from only 2. 1 %- 4. 9 %. By contrast, visceral fat <b>area</b> <b>measurements</b> showed markedly higher CVs (range: 9. 4 %- 17. 6 %). Moreover, relative variability was much larger in small visceral fat areas (CVs up to 25. 6 %). The majority of CVs, calculated for intra-observer variability and calculated from the average fat <b>area</b> <b>measurements</b> of three images, was lower than calculated for inter-observer variability and for one single image, respectively. In particular, for the visceral fat depot, this reduction in variability had practical consequences for the number of subjects required for a study. Variation of repeated image acquisition was in the same range as variation of repeated measurements on the same image. CONCLUSION: One image per body site is sufficient to obtain a reliable estimate of subcutaneous fat depots. For estimations of the visceral fat depot, the average <b>area</b> <b>measurements</b> of three images reduces variability and increases statistical power. The availability of one single experienced observer during a study adds to accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Besides {{coronary}} disease, valvular {{heart disease}} {{is one of the}} most common indications for heart surgery. Different methods are used for grading {{valvular heart disease}} as thransthoracic- and transoesophageal echocardiography (TTE, TEE), if needed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cardiac catheterization (CATH). However, all methods have their specific strength and limitations. We sought to determine the accuracy of multisclice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) for assessing of aortic- and mitral valve stenosis and to establish threshold values that best separate between different grades of stenosis severing. In our studies all patients underwent standardized MSCT, MRI and TTE in the context of their routine diagnostic work-up prior to cardiac surgery. The true anatomic valve area was measured by MSCT and MRI using manual planimetry. Planimetric valve <b>area</b> <b>measurements</b> were then compared with calculations based on Doppler flow velocity measurements by TTE (using continuity equation) and pressure grading measurements by CATH (using Gorlin formula). Series of valve <b>area</b> <b>measurements</b> correlated well between MSCT and the reference methods. Planimetric valve <b>area</b> <b>measurements</b> on MSCT allows therefore an accurate grading of valve stenosis severity. However, valve <b>area</b> <b>measurements</b> on MSCT were significantly larger than measurements on TTE and CATH. Consequently, the thresholds for discriminating between different severity grades have to be adjusted in MSCT...|$|R

A method where the advantage of accurate computerized measurement of the area on the digital photograph was combined with physician's proficiency in determination of the edge of psoriatic lesion was published. The patients were examined and photographed before and after the therapy with calcipotriol ointment or placebo. The psoriatic area was manually outlined on the patient's photographs by physician and the area was automatically measured by a computer. For comparison, the physicians also made standard psoriatic area assessment. Computer-aided measurement of psoriatic lesion area was found to improve the power of the clinical trial, compared to the standard approach. The physician's estimations of the psoriatic lesion area tend to overestimate. The adapted PASI index, where the psoriatic area was not converted into an area grade, but was maintained as a continuous variable, also improved the power of the clinical trial.
