50|$|Coarse threads {{are more}} {{resistant}} to stripping and cross threading because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> greater flank engagement. Coarse threads install much faster <b>as</b> <b>they</b> require fewer turns per unit length. Finer threads are stronger <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a larger stress area for the same diameter thread. Fine threads {{are less likely to}} vibrate loose <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a smaller helix angle and allow finer adjustment. Finer threads develop greater preload with less tightening torque.|$|R
