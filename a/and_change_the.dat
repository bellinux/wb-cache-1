5|$|An {{experimental}} vaccine {{was found}} to clear the amyloid plaques in early human trials, {{but it did not}} have any significant effect on dementia. Researchers have been led to suspect non-plaque Aβ oligomers (aggregates of many monomers) as the primary pathogenic form of Aβ. These toxic oligomers, also referred to as amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), bind to a surface receptor on neurons <b>and</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> structure of the synapse, thereby disrupting neuronal communication. One receptor for Aβ oligomers may be the prion protein, the same protein that has been linked to mad cow disease and the related human condition, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, thus potentially linking the underlying mechanism of these neurodegenerative disorders with that of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

5|$|GreenSky London, a {{biofuels}} plant {{under construction}} in 2014, aimed to take in some 500,000 tonnes of municipal rubbish <b>and</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> organic component into 60,000 tonnes of jet fuel, and 40 megawatts of power. By the end of 2015, it was hoped all British Airways flights from London City Airport will be fuelled by waste and rubbish discarded by London residents, leading to carbon savings equivalent to taking 150,000 cars off the road. Unfortunately, the £340m scheme was mothballed in January 2016 following low crude oil prices, jittery investors {{and a lack of}} support from the UK government.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a state-level {{alliance}} with the Children's Defense Fund. Later that year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana) appointed her {{to the board of}} directors of the Legal Services Corporation, and she served in that capacity from 1978 until the end of 1981. From mid-1978 to mid-1980, she was the chair of that board, the first woman to have the job. During her time as chair, funding for the Corporation was expanded from $90 million to $300 million; subsequently, she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan's attempts to reduce the funding <b>and</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> nature of the organization.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient Judaism, {{his fourth}} major {{work on the}} {{sociology}} of religion, Weber attempted to explain the factors {{that resulted in the}} early differences between Oriental and Occidental religiosity. He contrasted the innerworldly asceticism developed by Western Christianity with mystical contemplation of the kind developed in India. Weber noted that some aspects of Christianity sought to conquer <b>and</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> world, rather than withdraw from its imperfections. This fundamental characteristic of Christianity (when compared to Far Eastern religions) stems originally from ancient Jewish prophecy.|$|E

5|$|With Microsoft's funding, Remedy hired lots of {{high-profile}} actors, including Shawn Ashmore, Aidan Gillen, Lance Reddick and Dominic Monaghan. During the game's announcement and first gameplay reveal at Gamescom 2014, Jack Joyce was portrayed by Shaun Derry. According to Louden, they were creating the animation for Ashmore's character, {{and did not}} have sufficient time to finalize them before the event, so they used their game prototype, which has Derry starring as the lead character, as the game's demo. The change in lead actors also prompted the studio to update <b>and</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> game cover art. Ashmore, Monaghan and Gillen were announced as the game's protagonists and antagonists a year later, and Derry starred in the game as Nick.|$|E
5|$|In digital puppetry, machinima creators become virtual actors; each {{crew member}} {{controls}} {{a character in}} real-time, as in a multiplayer game. The director can use built-in camera controls, if available. Otherwise, video is captured {{from the perspectives of}} one or more puppeteers who serve as camera operators. Puppetry allows for improvisation and offers controls familiar to gamers, but requires more personnel than the other methods and is less precise than scripted recordings. However, some games, such as the Halo series, (except for Halo PC and Custom Edition, which allow AI and custom objects and characters), allow filming only through puppetry. According to Marino, other disadvantages are the possibility of disruption when filming in an open multi-user environment and the temptation for puppeteers to play the game in earnest, littering the set with blood and dead bodies. However, Chris Burke intentionally hosts This Spartan Life in these unpredictable conditions, which are fundamental to the show. Other works filmed using puppetry are the ILL Clan's improvisational comedy series On the Campaign Trail with Larry & Lenny Lumberjack and Rooster Teeth Productions' Red vs. Blue. In recamming, which builds on puppetry, actions are first recorded to a game engine's demo file format, not directly as video frames. Without re-enacting scenes, artists can then manipulate the demo files to add cameras, tweak timing and lighting, <b>and</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> surroundings. This technique is limited to the few engines and software tools that support it.|$|E
