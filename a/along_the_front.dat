5|$|Although the Serbian Army {{had put up}} fierce {{resistance}} and inflicted heavy casualties on the Austro-Hungarians, Putnik became concerned that his lines were over-extended. He began contemplating another strategic withdrawal, one in which Belgrade {{would have to be}} evacuated. On the night of 26–27 November, the Austro-Hungarian 6th Army attacked all <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and pushed deeper into the Serbian interior.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak, the {{national}} passenger rail system, provides service to Denver, operating its California Zephyr daily {{in both directions}} between Chicago and Emeryville, California, across the bay from San Francisco. Amtrak Thruway service operated by private bus companies links the Denver station with Rocky Mountain points. In 2017 a bill was introduced into the state legislature to connect towns and cities <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> Range with an additional Amtrak line or state-funded alternative.|$|E
5|$|The Masonic Hall in Taunton, Somerset, is {{designated}} by Historic England as a Grade II* listed building. It was originally {{built in the}} early 19th century as St George's Chapel, the first Roman Catholic chapel open for public worship in Taunton since the Reformation. The building, which forms {{the end of a}} terrace, features a series of prominent Ionic pilasters <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and southern end.|$|E

25|$|The {{middle section}} of the street {{contains}} numerous alleys stretching east while the block {{on the opposite side}} forms a continuous block, the extent of which is caused by the medieval city wall which stretched behind <b>the</b> block, <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>fronts</b> facing Baggensgatan.|$|R
5|$|A {{long line}} of subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> {{edge of the stage}} can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing of horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array. Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.|$|E
5|$|After Christmas 1914, {{sporadic}} {{attempts were}} made at seasonal truces; a German unit attempted to leave their trenches under a flag of truce on Easter Sunday 1915, but were warned off by the British opposite them, {{and later in the}} year, in November, a Saxon unit briefly fraternised with a Liverpool battalion. In December 1915, there were explicit orders by the Allied commanders to forestall any repeat of the previous Christmas truce. Individual units were encouraged to mount raids and harass the enemy line, whilst communicating with the enemy was discouraged by artillery barrages <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line throughout the day. The prohibition was not completely effective, however, and a small number of brief truces occurred.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{training in}} Palestine, in early 1941, the 2/15th took up positions <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> {{line in the}} Western Desert, before being pushed back to Tobruk. Between April and October 1941, along with a garrison of British and other Australian personnel, the battalion helped to hold the strategically important port, which had been surrounded following the landing of German troops at Tripoli. It was withdrawn by sea in late October 1941 as the 9th Division was relieved by the British 70th Division. Following its withdrawal from Tobruk, the battalion re-formed at Gaza before undertaking garrison duties in Syria. In mid-1942, the 2/15th returned to North Africa {{to fight in the}} First and Second Battles of El Alamein.|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} finite-element {{analysis of}} a middle-crack tension specimen subjected to mode I loading was performed to study <b>the</b> stress singularity <b>along</b> <b>the</b> crack <b>front.</b> <b>The</b> specimen was modeled using 20 -node isoparametric elements with collapsed nonsingular elements at <b>the</b> crack <b>front.</b> <b>The</b> displacements and stresses from the analysis were used to estimate the power of singularities, by a log-log regression analysis, <b>along</b> <b>the</b> crack <b>front.</b> Analyses showed that finite-sized cracked bodies have two singular stress fields. Because of two singular stress fields near the free surface and the classical square root singularity elsewhere, the strain energy release rate {{appears to be an}} appropriate parameter all <b>along</b> <b>the</b> crack <b>front...</b>|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 17th century, Lord Leicester's heir, Philip Sidney, 3rd Earl of Leicester, {{permitted}} a small amount of retail development in booths <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of Leicester House. A statue of King George I was built on the square in 1760 following the coronation of his grandson, George III. The square remained fashionable throughout most of the 18th century, with notable residents including the architect James Stuart at No35 from 1766 to 1788 and the painter John Singleton Copley at No.28 from 1776 to 1783.|$|E
5|$|Even though racial {{politics}} often {{resulted in}} the company receiving untrained replacements, it performed well in many small-scale engagements during this time. In the summer of 1951, the company was employed <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line as an advance force to push back Chinese attacks as the front lines became more static. The company was highly regarded for its actions capturing and holding Hill 581 during the Battle of the Soyang River, in which the company inflicted hundreds of casualties on the Chinese without a single Ranger being killed.|$|E
5|$|In Baby Face Stanwyck {{moves to}} New York and sleeps {{her way to}} the top of Gotham Trust. Her {{progress}} is illustrated in a recurring visual metaphor of the movie camera panning ever upward <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of Gotham Trust's skyscraper. Men are driven mad with lust over her and they commit murder, attempt suicide, and are ruined financially for associating with her before she mends her ways in the final reel. In another departure from post Code films, Stanwyck's sole companion for the duration of the picture is a black woman named Chico (Theresa Harris), whom she took with her when she ran away from home at age 14.|$|E

5|$|Most non-Republican Guard armored units had older tank designs, {{mainly the}} T-55 or its Chinese equivalents, the Type 59 and Type 69. The {{remaining}} 34 divisions were composed of poorly trained conscripts. These divisions were deployed to channel the Coalition's forces {{through a number}} of break points <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> allowing the Iraqi Army's heavy divisions and the Republican Guard units to isolate them and counterattack. However, the Iraqis left their western flank open, failing to account for tactics made possible by the Global Positioning System and other new technologies.|$|E
5|$|On October 6, 1973, Egypt {{launched}} Operation Badr, {{which started}} the Yom-Kippur War. It succeeded in crossing the Suez Canal and establishing bridgeheads {{on the east}} bank in Israeli-occupied Sinai, and counter-attacks by launched by Israeli reserves were unsuccessful. By October 10, fighting <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> {{had come to a}} lull. Egyptian President Anwar Sadat soon ordered an offensive to seize the strategic Sinai mountain passes, despite protests and objections by his senior commanders against such an offensive. Sadat hoped to divert Israeli pressure from the Syrians. The October 14 offensive was ill-planned and ill-executed, and culminated in heavy Egyptian losses without achieving any objectives.|$|E
5|$|Termites are {{relatively}} poor fliers and are readily blown downwind in wind speeds {{of less than}} 2km/h, shedding their wings soon after landing at an acceptable site, where they mate and attempt to form a nest in damp timber or earth. Wings of most termites have three heavy veins along the basal part of {{the front edge of}} the forewing and the crossveins near the wing tip are angled, making trapezoidal cells. Although subterranean termite wings have just two major veins <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> edge of the forewing and the cross veins towards the wingtip are perpendicular to these veins, making square and rectangular cells.|$|E

5|$|The Kop Stand and the Tilton Road Stand, {{opened in}} 1994, form a {{continuous}} L-shaped single-tier stand, with seating capacity for nearly 17,000 spectators, round the remaining {{half of the}} pitch. A walkway separates back and front sections. The Kop seating includes the directors' box and a row of executive boxes, within the stand {{are a number of}} function rooms and hospitality areas, and there are electronic perimeter advertising boards in front. The stadium has floodlight pylons only on the north side; the south side is lit by a row of lights <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the Kop roof. The Tilton Road Stand has 9,000 seats, and is the only one without hospitality boxes.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman advance {{was at a}} {{standstill}} everywhere. After a long night's march, the German and Ottoman troops faced a difficult day under the desert sun {{without being able to}} replenish their water and exposed to artillery fire from Romani. At this time, the attacking forces held a line running from the Bardawil (on the Mediterranean coast) southward <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the 52nd Infantry Division's entrenchments and then westward through and including the very large sand dunes of Mount Meredith and Mount Royston. But from their position on Mount Royston, the German, Austrian and Ottoman force dominated the camp area of Romani and threatened the railway line.|$|E
5|$|The terrace {{comprises}} three {{one story}} cottages, a six room cottage for the principal keeper and two three room cottages for the assistants, all {{sharing the same}} roof. Each of the cottages had a kitchen, a storeroom and a privy. The building was constructed of the same imported sandstone as the lighthouse, dressed outside and plastered inside. The roof was originally made of slate, replaced in 1901 with terracotta, with five chimneys along the ridge and a bay window and gables <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>front.</b> A low terrace was built at the rear from random stone. Photographs from the 1950s also show a rear addition with a skillion roof infilling part of the verandah.|$|E

5|$|The town escaped heavy bombing {{during the}} Second World War, but the sea front {{incurred}} great damage {{when it was}} fortified against invasion. The cast iron lampposts and benches <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> were removed and melted down for munitions, as was much of the superstructure from both Bournemouth and Boscombe piers before they were breached to prevent their use by enemy ships. The large amounts of barbed wire and anti-tank obstacles along the beach, and the mines {{at the foot of}} the chines, took two years to remove when peace was finally achieved.|$|E
