Finnish {{long-range}} reconnaissance patrols, organized both by Finnish HQ—4th Separate Battalion (Er.P 4)—and by local units, patrolled beyond Soviet lines.

25|$|The {{buildings}} of the 1920s–1930s were built using primitive technologies (masonry, wet stucco, wooden ceilings and partitions), low-grade materials and a low-grade workforce.

25|$|The nave {{is where}} most of the {{congregation}} stand during services. Traditionally, men stand on the right <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> the left. This is for a number of reasons: (1) Considering the family unit of past centuries the husband was dominant; thus, standing the same distance from the altar, equality is emphasised. (2) The idea of separating the sexes was inherited from the Jewish tradition of doing so within synagogues (3) Separation of sexes also followed the practice of choirs in which different levels of voice are placed in groups to facilitate harmony.|$|E
25|$|Women were {{eventually}} {{admitted to the}} House of Lords in 1958. The Life Peerages Act passed that year permitted the creation of life baronies for both men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> a regular basis. Hereditary peeresses were admitted in 1963 under the Peerage Act. The Peerage Act also permitted peers to disclaim hereditary peerages {{within a year of}} succeeding to them, or within a year of attaining the age of majority. All eligible Scottish peers were permitted to sit in the House of Lords, and elections for representative peers ceased. Elections for Irish representative peers had already ended in 1922, when most of Ireland left the United Kingdom to become the Irish Free State.|$|E
25|$|According to {{a saying}} {{attributed}} to Muhammad in the hadith Sahih Bukhari, women {{are allowed to}} go to mosques. However, as Islam spread, Muslim authorities stressed the fears of unchastity from interaction between sexes outside their home, including the mosque. By pre-modern period it was unusual for women to pray at a mosque. By the late 1960s, women in urban areas of the Middle East increasingly began praying in the mosque, but men and women generally worship separately. (Muslims explain this by citing the need to avoid distraction during prayer prostrations that raise the buttocks while the forehead touches the ground.) Separation between sexes ranges from men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> opposite sides of an aisle, to men in front of women (as {{was the case in the}} time of Muhammad), to women in second-floor balconies or separate rooms accessible by a door for women only. Women in the state of ritual impurity, such as menstruation, are forbidden from entering the prayer hall of the mosque.|$|E

25|$|University College, Bristol {{opened on}} Tuesday 10 October 1876 at 9.00 a.m. with a Mathematics lecture by W. R. Bousfield, who also lectured in higher maths an hour later. The charges {{for such a}} course were three guineas for two lectures each week during the Christmas and Easter terms; a student also had to pay 7s as an {{entrance}} fee to enroll. At its opening in 1876, two professors and five lecturers offered lectures in fifteen subject areas. The college was situated at 32 Park Row and was rented for £50 per annum. As requested by Jowett when giving money, the College was open to men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> the same basis (except in medicine), The College offered scholarships the most valuable of which was one in Chemistry worth £25. General scholarships of £15 were also available. Despite the label of 'University' however, the institution {{did not have the}} power to award degrees to its students. There were however links with the University of London which allowed the external sitting of these examinations and the Cambridge Local Higher Examinations useful for those who wished to become teachers.|$|E

25|$|The Ethiopian church {{places a}} heavier {{emphasis}} on Old Testament teachings {{than one might}} find in Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic or Protestant churches, and its followers adhere to certain practices that one finds in Orthodox or Conservative Judaism. Ethiopian Christians, like some other Eastern Christians, traditionally follow dietary rules {{that are similar to}} Jewish Kashrut, specifically with regard to how an animal is slaughtered. Similarly, pork is prohibited, though unlike Rabbinical Kashrut, Ethiopian cuisine does mix dairy products with meat. Women are prohibited from entering the church temple during menses; they are also expected to cover their hair with a large scarf (or shash) while in church, as described in 1 Corinthians, chapter 11.

Furthermore, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church upholds Sabbatarianism, observing the seventh-day Sabbath (Saturday), in addition to the Lord's Day (Sunday), although more emphasis, because of the Resurrection of Christ, is laid upon Sunday.

500|$|On December 10, 1951, Easton Mayor Joseph Morrison {{flipped the}} switch to light up the Christmas Candle during its first {{dedication}} ceremony. Joining Morrison and Frank Bechtel in the dedication were a Catholic priest, a Jewish rabbi and a Protestant minister, to demonstrate the Christmas Candle was meant {{to serve as a}} symbol of peace for all religions and denominations. News reports indicate between 500 and 1,000 people attended the ceremony. In addition to the candle, the decorations included Christmas trees, smaller candle displays, large plywood wreaths and Christmas lights set up by students from the Easton High School and the city's Wolf and Schull junior high schools. It also included a plaque honoring the Easton area men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> active duty in the United States armed forces. The Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission decorated the nearby Northampton Street bridge, which crossed the Delaware River, with its first Christmas light display in 14 years. A series of nightly Christmas choir concerts were held in front of the Christmas Candle starting December 18, and organ music was piped to the Centre Square from the city's First Presbyterian Church. Downtown business owners participated by decorating their windows with Christmas themes. Morrison called the Christmas Candle display [...] "the most elaborate in Easton's history". The Christmas Candle was so large it drew the attention of airplanes passing over the city.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} positively by reviewers {{of the trade}} publications. A very positive review by Walton of The Moving Picture News states, [...] " [...] tale of deep, sterling, human interest. The whole plot is so simple, so refreshingly lucid and pure. We cannot criticize this film {{any more than a}} man could analyze mother love. There is a tenderness - and pathos - that is as a nimbus to the whole. The acting of the blind girl, natural, and exquisite, and of her little sister is sweetly innocent. We saw this film twice, on the day of release, in different theatres, and in each case large audiences were touched - and also highly amused by the little girl in the carriage. A sweeter, purer, human-interest tale has not been put on the curtain. The prayer scene deserves to be limned by a master hands that lesson to our children's children. Had we space we could tell the comments of men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> this production. One thing may be said and that is, all saw and realized the pathos, the beauty and the triumph of the work. Had the film been acted in a theatre we feel certain the audience, with ourselves, with one acclaim would have declared these two orphan girls as manifestations, in the hour of need, of the highest and best emotions of the race!" [...] The Moving Picture Worlds reviewer was also positive and concluded that, [...] "Such films are helpful because they make nearly despairing men sometimes hopeful, and as long as hope lasts there is opportunity for achievement." [...] Even the reviewer of The New York Dramatic Mirror offered praise for Marie Eline's acting ability in particular, but found no fault with the production itself. Bowers notes that the Mirror was not without its detractors and was accused of being a tool of the Edison Trust companies, but reviews for Thanhouser films were amongst the most perceptive.|$|E
