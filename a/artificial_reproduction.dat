40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} purely {{mechanical}} analog of the conventional chemo-mechanical modeling of muscle contraction. We abandon the description of kinetics of the power stroke in terms of jump processes and instead resolve the continuous stochastic evolution on an appropriate energy landscape. In general physical terms, we replace hard spin chemical variables by soft spin variables representing mechanical snap-springs. This allows us to treat the case of small and even disappearing barriers and, more importantly, to incorporate the mechanical representation of the power stroke into the theory of Brownian ratchets. The model provides the simplest non-chemical description for the main stages of the biochemical Lymn-Taylor cycle and {{may be used as}} a basis for the <b>artificial</b> micro-mechanical <b>reproduction</b> of the muscle contraction mechanism. ...|$|R

60|$|Of {{all these}} works, {{as well as}} of the bell shrines, book-covers, {{sculptured}} crosses and illuminated designs in manuscripts, excellent pictures are given in Miss Stokes's handbook. The extremely interesting Fiachal Phadrig, or shrine of St. Patrick's tooth, might have been figured and noted as an interesting example of the survival of ornament, and one of the old miniatures of the scribe or Evangelist writing would have given an additional interest to the chapter on Irish MSS. On the whole, however, the book is wonderfully well illustrated, and the ordinary art student will be able to get some useful suggestions from it. Indeed, Miss Stokes, echoing the aspirations of many of the great Irish archaeologists, looks forward to the revival of a native Irish school in architecture, sculpture, metal-work and painting. Such an aspiration is, of course, very laudable, but there is always a danger of these revivals being merely <b>artificial</b> <b>reproductions,</b> and it may be questioned whether the peculiar forms of Irish ornamentation could be made at all expressive of the modern spirit. A recent writer on house decoration has gravely suggested that the British householder should take his meals in a Celtic dining-room adorned with a dado of Ogham inscriptions, and such wicked proposals may serve as a warning to all who fancy that the reproduction of a form necessarily implies a revival of the spirit that gave the form life and meaning, and who fail to recognise the difference between art and anachronisms. Miss Stokes's proposal for an ark-shaped church in which the mural painter is to repeat the arcades and 'follow the architectural compositions of the grand pages of the Eusebian canons in the Book of Kells,' has, of course, nothing grotesque about it, but it is not probable that the artistic genius of the Irish people will, even when 'the land has rest,' find in such interesting imitations its healthiest or best expression. Still, there are certain elements of beauty in ancient Irish art that the modern artist would do well to study. The value of the intricate illuminations in the Book of Kells, as far as their adaptability to modern designs and modern material goes, has been very much overrated, but in the ancient Irish torques, brooches, pins, clasps and the like, the modern goldsmith will find a rich and, comparatively speaking, an untouched field; and now that the Celtic spirit has become the leaven of our politics, there is no reason why it should not contribute something to our decorative art. This result, however, will not be obtained by a patriotic misuse of old designs, and even the most enthusiastic Home Ruler must not be allowed to decorate his dining-room with a dado of Oghams.|$|R

40|$|AbstractCurrently, most organic {{dairy farmers}} in the Netherlands use {{conventional}} breeding methods and production stock. In view of the organic objective of closed chains, organic dairy farmers discussed in workshops the desirability and practical merits of different possible scenarios for realizing breeding programmes that are {{more in line with}} organic farming principles. Generally, farmers concluded {{that there is a need}} for organic breeding practices to support the sector's credibility towards consumers and society. The first step in developing organic breeding practices is to ban the indirect use of <b>artificial</b> embryo <b>reproduction</b> technologies, but there was no consensus on which selection strategies best fit organic principles. Most organic farmers preferred to uphold the familiar breeding structure of index selection and artificial insemination. Since the scale of organic farming remains small, a distinct breeding structure for organic farming will be difficult to achieve. Customizing conventional breeding values and an international co-operation between breeding programmes may be (temporary) solutions. In organic farming, farm-based regional breeding strategies based on kin-breeding may be more appropriate but farmers lack knowledge of these practices. Also decision-makers need more knowledge on the influence of the (yet not quantified) genotype × environment interaction on the estimation of breeding values for sires when considering organic and conventional farming as different environments. Substantial genotype × environment interaction would support selection under conditions representative for organic environments.

First, a brief history of quality control in mass-rearing of insects is described.

These differing traits are reviewed and the factors which caused these differences are considered. It was considered that the differences between wild and mass-reared melon files depended on the selection pressures from the mass-rearing method. Next, the results of several artificial selection experiments using the melon fly are reviewed. Finally, consideration is given to some correlated responses to artificial selection in mass-rearing. Longevity that is correlated to early fecundity was successfully controlled by <b>artificial</b> selection for <b>reproduction</b> in the mass-rearing system.

Even though <b>artificial</b> breeding or <b>reproduction</b> of M. nemurus is done in private hatcheries around Peninsular Malaysia, inadequate seed supply coupled with relatively high fingerling prices limits its production.

At present, the conventional method of fish larviculture using live food such as Artemia nauplii is being practiced by most Malaysian catfish hatchery operators. Using expensive live food like Artemia has made the mass production of catfish fry/fingerlings less profitable. Alternative measures are necessary in order to help minimize importation and use of Artemia. Indigenous species of live food organisms, which are great potential as feed and can easily be cultured and mass-produced at low cost, may be used as substitutes.

40|$|International audienceBackground A {{major step}} towards {{the success of}} {{chickens}} as a domesticated species was the separation between maternal care and <b>reproduction.</b> <b>Artificial</b> incubation replaced the natural maternal behaviour of incubation and, thus, in certain breeds, it became possible to breed chickens with persistent egg production and no incubation behaviour; a typical example is the White Leghorn strain. Conversely, some strains, such as the Silkie breed, are prized for their maternal behaviour and their willingness to incubate eggs. This is often colloquially known as broodiness. ResultsUsing an F 2 linkage mapping approach and a cross between White Leghorn and Silkie chicken breeds, we have mapped, for the first time, genetic loci that affect maternal behaviour on chromosomes 1, 5, 8, 13, 18 and 19 and linkage group E 22 C 19 W 28. Paradoxically, heterozygous and White Leghorn homozygous genotypes were {{associated with an increased}} incidence of incubation behaviour, which exceeded that of the Silkie homozygotes for most loci. In such cases, {{it is likely that the}} loci involved are associated with increased egg production. Increased egg production increases the probability of incubation behaviour occurring because egg laying must precede incubation. For the loci on chromosomes 8 and 1, alleles from the Silkie breed promote incubation behaviour and influence maternal behaviour (these explain 12 and 26  % of the phenotypic difference between the two founder breeds, respectively). ConclusionsThe over-dominant locus on chromosome 5 coincides with the strongest selective sweep reported in chickens and together with the loci on chromosomes 1 and 8, they include genes of the thyrotrophic axis. This suggests that thyroid hormones may play a critical role in the loss of incubation behaviour and the improved egg laying behaviour of the White Leghorn breed. Our findings support the view that loss of maternal incubation behaviour in the White Leghorn breed is the result of selection for fertility and egg laying persistency and against maternal incubation behaviour...|$|R
