5000|$|In taxonomy, <b>a</b> <b>segregate,</b> or <b>a</b> <b>segregate</b> taxon {{is created}} when a taxon is split off from another taxon. This other taxon {{will be better}} known, usually bigger, and will {{continue}} to exist, even after the segregate taxon has been split off. <b>A</b> <b>segregate</b> will be either new or ephemeral: there is a tendency for taxonomists to disagree on segregates, and later workers often reunite <b>a</b> <b>segregate</b> with the 'mother' taxon.|$|R
50|$|If <b>a</b> <b>segregate</b> is {{generally}} {{accepted as a}} 'good' taxon it ceases to be <b>a</b> <b>segregate.</b> Thus, {{this is a way}} of indicating change in the taxonomic status. It should not be confused with, for example, the subdivision of a genus into subgenera.|$|R

5|$|Automatic {{closure of}} public schools which racially {{integrate}} — The legislation required that any school which integrated (voluntarily or not) must be immediately and automatically closed. However, the governor was given the discretion to take over integrated school(s) and reopen the school(s) on <b>a</b> <b>segregated</b> basis rather than close the entire district. Integrated schools {{did not have to}} stay closed, however. A school district could petition the governor to take over one or more schools (or the entire district) that had closed and reopen them as segregated schools. Whether exercising his discretion or acting on a petition from the school district, the governor was authorized to act only as an agent of the Assembly. The governor was also required to try to persuade the African American child to return to his or her racially segregated school, so that the schools could reopen on <b>a</b> <b>segregated</b> basis.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{took several}} side jobs {{to save money}} for college, {{including}} waiting tables at the Holmes Club, a saloon for white U.S. Army soldiers. In this job, Brown was frequently the target of racist vitriol and abuse, but nonetheless persevered, earning $600 to pay for college. In the autumn of 1944, Brown took <b>a</b> <b>segregated</b> train to Columbus, Ohio, and began school at Ohio State.|$|E

After four African-American college students staged a sit-in in <b>a</b> <b>segregated</b> North Carolina department store, the sit-in movement gained momentum across the United States. During 1960-61, the ACLU defended black students arrested for demonstrating in North Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana. The ACLU also provided legal help for the Freedom Rides in 1961, {{the integration of the}} University of Mississippi, the Birmingham campaign in 1963, and the 1964 Freedom Summer.|$|E
5|$|The 827th Tank Destroyer Battalion was a tank {{destroyer}} {{battalion of}} the United States Army active during the Second World War. It was activated in April 1942 as <b>a</b> <b>segregated</b> African American unit, deploying to Europe {{at the end}} of 1944 and attached to 12th Armored Division. It saw action during Operation Nordwind in January 1945, where elements of the battalion performed creditably. However, its overall combat record was marred by severe disciplinary problems and insufficient training. It was withdrawn in February, and assigned to rear-area duties; while it nominally remained active {{for the remainder of the}} war, it had been effectively disbanded.|$|E

The main {{objective}} 			was {{to highlight the}} emotional problems prevalent in the Pakistani 			youth with <b>an</b> Early <b>Segregated</b> Education. For this purpose a study 			was carried out on the individuals with <b>an</b> Early <b>Segregated</b> and <b>an</b> 			Early Non <b>Segregated</b> Education. 			In order {{to find out the}} Vulnerability to Emotional Problems the 			IPAT Anxiety scale and IPAT Depression scale were administered on a 			sample of 400 individuals within the age range of 20 to 35 years. 			The 400 participants were further divided into four categories 			comprising of 100 females with <b>an</b> Early <b>Segregated</b> educational 			background, 100 males with <b>an</b> Early <b>Segregated</b> educational 			background, 100 females with <b>an</b> Early Non <b>Segregated</b> educational 			background and 100 males with <b>an</b> Early Non <b>Segregated</b> educational 			background. 			Chi square test was computed in order to obtain the statistical 			significance of the data. All the hypotheses were found to be 			statistically significant at 001 level. The findings of the 			present research data provide the evidence that the individuals who 			received <b>an</b> early <b>Segregated</b> education have high anxiety and 			depression sten scores than the individuals who received <b>an</b> early 			Non <b>Segregated</b> education 			Overall, the depression sten scores were found to be higher than the 			anxiety sten scores. The results of the present research also show 			that the females who received <b>an</b> early <b>Segregated</b> education have 			high depression sten scores than the anxiety sten scores of the 			males who received <b>an</b> early <b>Segregated</b> education. In the light of 			the above given results it can be concluded that in order to improve 			the mental health of the Pakistani youth with <b>an</b> Early <b>Segregated</b> 			Education some specific preventive measures should be taken into 			account by the concerned authorities...|$|R

5|$|The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions {{encouraged}} its 800,000 {{members to}} not fly with Braathens {{due to the}} introduction of <b>a</b> <b>segregated</b> classes. SAS did not follow the same policy, and offered its discounted customers to travel in the same class as Braathens', including complimentary service. After introduction, the concept increased the work load on handing employees, who needed to check the passengers' tickets to ensure they sat in the right class. There were also complaints from Best-passengers who felt that they were receiving worse service after the scheme was introduced.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Nazis invaded Poland {{and forced}} that nation's second-largest {{community}} of Jews, 270,000 strong, into {{one section of}} the city of Łódź, which they later walled off to form a ghetto. Before the invasion, Syvia and her family lived in Łódź. When her father heard rumors of the impending German invasion, the family traveled by buggy to Warsaw. The family was unable to find work or housing in Warsaw, so they returned to Lodz. When the Germans did invade, they forced Syvia's family to relocate, along with other Łódź-area Jews, into <b>a</b> <b>segregated</b> section of the city: a ghetto. The book relates Syvia's explanations of what life in the ghetto is like: her friends, people around the ghetto, jobs, and her schedule. It relates how Syvia's family is forced to sell her doll, leaving her with rags and buttons as her playthings.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Robinson {{was drafted}} and {{assigned}} to <b>a</b> <b>segregated</b> Army cavalry unit in Fort Riley, Kansas. Having the requisite qualifications, Robinson {{and several other}} black soldiers applied for admission to an Officer Candidate School (OCS) then located at Fort Riley. Although the Army's initial July 1941 guidelines for OCS had been drafted as race neutral, few black applicants were admitted into OCS until after subsequent directives by Army leadership. As a result, the applications of Robinson and his colleagues were delayed for several months. After protests by heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis (then stationed at Fort Riley) and the help of Truman Gibson (then an assistant civilian aide to the Secretary of War), the men were accepted into OCS. The experience led to a personal friendship between Robinson and Louis. Upon finishing OCS, Robinson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in January 1943. Shortly afterward, Robinson and Isum were formally engaged.|$|E

5|$|Longstanding racial {{tensions}} between {{whites and blacks}} exploded in five days of violence that started on July 27, 1919. On that hot summer day, on <b>a</b> <b>segregated</b> Chicago beach, a white man was throwing rocks at black swimmers in the water at a beach on the South Side which resulted in Eugene Williams' death. Tensions escalated when a white police officer not only failed to arrest the white man responsible for Williams' death, but arrested a black man instead. Objections by black observers were met with violence by whites. Attacks between white and black mobs erupted swiftly. At one point, a white mob threatened Provident Hospital, many of whose patients were African American. The police successfully held them off.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Filipino Infantry Regiment was <b>a</b> <b>segregated</b> United States Army {{infantry}} regiment {{made up of}} Filipino Americans {{from the}} continental United States and a few veterans of the Battle of the Philippines that saw combat during World War II. It was formed and activated at Camp San Luis Obispo, California, {{under the auspices of}} the California National Guard. Originally created as a battalion, it was declared a regiment on 13 July 1942. Deployed initially to New Guinea in 1944, it became a source of manpower for special forces and units that would serve in occupied territories. In 1945, it deployed to the Philippines, where it first saw combat as a unit. After major combat operations, it remained in the Philippines until it returned to California and was deactivated in 1946 at Camp Stoneman.|$|E
5|$|SODO Station is {{situated}} along the SODO Busway in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle. The entrances to its two side platforms {{is located at}} the intersection of the SODO Busway and South Lander Street, adjacent to a United States Postal Service parking garage. The area surrounding the station consists of a mixture of industrial and low-density commercial areas without residences, employing over 12,000 workers. Major employers in the area include Starbucks, who has their headquarters at the Starbucks Center five blocks west of the station, and Seattle Public Schools at the John Stanford Center. The light rail line is paralleled to the east by a mixed-use bicycle trail called the SODO Trail, which connects SODO Station to Stadium station at South Royal Brougham Way. The Seattle Department of Transportation plans to extend the trail to Spokane Street, connecting it to a bike trail on the Spokane Street Viaduct, serving West Seattle; a connector trail on Forest Street to <b>a</b> <b>segregated</b> cycletrack on Airport Way is also being considered.|$|E
50|$|The family Omphalotaceae, {{described}} by A. Bresinsky in 1985 as <b>a</b> <b>segregate</b> from the Tricholomataceae, is currently considered synonymous with Marasmiaceae.

Older fern classifications took a broad circumscription of Botrychium and included the genus in family Ophioglossaceae.|$|R
5|$|The 31st Division {{remained}} at Morotai until 12 April 1945 when it departed {{to participate in}} the liberation of Mindanao, and was replaced by the 93rd Infantry Division. The 93rd Division was <b>a</b> <b>segregated</b> African American unit, and was mainly used for security and labor tasks during the war. Once established on Morotai the division conducted intensive patrols with the aim of destroying the remaining Japanese force on the island. At this time most of the Japanese on Morotai were located along the island's west coast, and generally stayed close to native gardens. The 93rd Division landed patrols along Morotai's west and north coasts from April onwards, and these fought scattered skirmishes with small Japanese forces. One of the division's main goals was to capture Colonel Ouchi, and this was achieved by a patrol from the 25th Infantry Regiment on 2 August. Ouchi was one of the highest-ranked Japanese officers to be captured {{before the end of the}} war. The American force also used propaganda broadcasts and leaflets to encourage Japanese soldiers on Morotai to surrender, with some success.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania Avenue (often known {{simply as}} The Avenue) and Fremont Avenue were the major scenes for Baltimore's black musicians from the 1920s to the 1950s, and was an early home for Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, among others. Baltimore had long been a major stop on the black touring circuit, and jazz musicians {{frequently}} played on Pennsylvania Avenue {{on the way to}} or from engagements in New York. Pennsylvania Avenue attracted African Americans {{from as far away as}} North Carolina, and was known for its vibrant entertainment and nightlife, as well as a more seedy side, home to prostitution, violence, ragtime and jazz, which were perceived as unsavory. The single most important venue for outside acts was the Royal Theatre, which was one of the finest African American theaters in the country when it was opened as the Douglass Theater, and was part of the popular performing circuit that included the Earle in Philadelphia, the Howard in Washington, D.C., the Regal in Chicago and the Apollo Theater in New York; like the Apollo, the audience at the Royal Theater was known for cruelly receiving those performers who didn't live up to their standards. Music venues were segregated, though not without resistance - a 1910 tour featuring Bert Williams resulted in an African American boycott of <b>a</b> <b>segregated</b> theater, hoping the threat of lost business from the popular show would cause a change in policy. Pennsylvania Avenue was also a center for black cultural and economic life in Baltimore, and was home to numerous schools, theaters, churches and other landmarks. The street's nightclubs and other entertainment venues were most significant however, including the Penn Hotel, the first African American-owned hotel in Baltimore (built in 1921). Even the local bars and other establishments that didn't feature live music as a major feature generally had a solo pianist or organist. The first local bar to specialize in jazz was Club Tijuana. Major music venues at this time included Ike Dixon's Comedy Club, Skateland, Gamby's, Wendall's Tavern, The New Albert Dreamland, the Ritz, and most importantly, the Sphinx Club. The Sphinx Club became one of the first minority-owned nightclubs in the United States when it opened in 1946, founded by Charles Phillip Tilghman, a local businessman.|$|E
