40|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} one of the leading causes of {{morbidity}} and mortality amongst female cancer worldwide, especially in developing countries, including Ethiopia. The level of women's knowledge <b>about</b> cervical <b>cancer</b> is not well documented in Ethiopia. The current study sought to assess women's knowledge <b>about</b> cervical <b>cancer</b> and associated factors. A community based cross-sectional survey was conducted with a sample of 620 women aged 15 - 49 years residing in Dessie town, Northeast Ethiopia. Respondents were selected using a multistage sampling technique. The women were interviewed at home by trained data collectors using a structured questionnaire on cervical <b>cancer</b> knowledge. Knowledge <b>about</b> cervical <b>cancer</b> was measured using an eight item instrument. The maximum possible score was 8; those scoring 5 or more were categorized as having "sufficient" knowledge. Binary and multiple logistic regressions were employed to determine factors associated with knowledge <b>about</b> cervical <b>cancer.</b> A total of 51 % of the participants had sufficient knowledge <b>about</b> cervical <b>cancer.</b> After adjusting for covariates, having sufficient knowledge <b>about</b> cervical <b>cancer</b> was positively associated with better educational level and income. Women with primary education (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) : 3. 4; 95 % CI: 2. 2 - 5. 1) and those who had secondary and above education (AOR: 8. 7; 95 % CI: 5. 5 - 13. 7) were more likely to have sufficient knowledge <b>about</b> cervical <b>cancer</b> compared to those who had no formal education. Furthermore, women earning an average household monthly income above 1500 Ethiopian birr (ETB) (~ 75 U. S. dollars) were more likely to have sufficient knowledge (AOR: 2. 3; 95 % CI: 1. 3 - 3. 9) than women with an average household monthly income less than 500 ETB (~ 25 U. S. dollars). This study shows a suboptimal knowledge <b>about</b> cervical <b>cancer</b> regarding its risk factors, signs and symptoms, prevention and treatment among women in the study site. The level of education and economic status were found to be important determinants for knowledge <b>about</b> cervical <b>cancer.</b> Prevention programs should focus cervical cancer educational resources on women with less education and women with lower economic status groups...|$|R

We included {{a question on}} patient–provider discussions <b>about</b> lung <b>cancer</b> screening on a statewide population-based survey to establish baseline prevalence for surveillance and to identify subpopulation disparities. Methods: We analyzed the 2012 / 2013 Kansas Adult Tobacco Survey to assess patient–provider discussions <b>about</b> lung <b>cancer</b> screening. Weighted prevalence estimates and adjusted odds ratios were calculated to examine characteristics associated with discussing screening. Results: The prevalence of patient–provider discussions <b>about</b> lung <b>cancer</b> screening among current and former smokers aged 55 to 74  years was 31. 0 % (95 % CI 27. 0 – 35. 0). The adjusted prevalence odds of having these discussions was higher among males, adults aged 65 to 74  years, adults living with a disability, {{as well as those}} who saw a health professional in the past year and had their smoking status assessed or were advised to quit. Conclusions: The current study is unique as it is the first to assess patient–provider discussions <b>about</b> lung <b>cancer</b> screening using a statewide survey.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} predictors of perceived vulnerability for breast cancer in women with an average risk for breast cancer. On the basis of empirical findings that suggested which variables might be associated with perceived vulnerability for breast cancer, we investigated whether knowledge of breast cancer risk factors, <b>cancer</b> worry, intrusions <b>about</b> breast <b>cancer,</b> optimism <b>about</b> not getting <b>cancer</b> and perceived health status have a predictive value for perceived breast cancer vulnerability. DESIGN: In a 3 -step approach, we recruited 292 women from the general public in Germany who had neither a family history of breast cancer nor breast cancer themselves. After receiving an initial informational letter about study objectives, the women were interviewed by telephone and then asked to fill in a self-administered questionnaire. METHODS: We used structural equation modelling and hypothesized that each of the included variables has a direct influence on perceived vulnerability for breast cancer. RESULTS: We found a valid model with acceptable fit indices. Optimism <b>about</b> not getting <b>cancer,</b> intrusions <b>about</b> breast <b>cancer</b> and women's perceived health status explained 32 % of the variance of perceived vulnerability for breast cancer. Cancer worry and knowledge <b>about</b> breast <b>cancer</b> did not influence perceived vulnerability for breast cancer.
