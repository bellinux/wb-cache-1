40|$|<b>Mutual</b> <b>aid</b> {{groups are}} a source of {{structure}} and continuing support for people seeking recovery from alcohol or drug dependence, and for those directly or indirectly affected by dependence, such as partners, close friends, children and other family members. The evidence base shows that clients who actively participate in <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> are more likely to sustain their recovery, and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that treatment staff routinely provide information about <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> groups and facilitate access {{for those who want to}} attend (NICE, 2007; NICE, 2011; NICE, 2012). In working towards compliance with NICE quality standards, local commissioners and service providers will seek to ensure that facilitating access to <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> is supported within the local recovery system and that keyworkers recognise it as an integral part of their role. Keyworkers must give thought to the way they approach the subject of <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> with their clients because the evidence shows that simply providing information and leaving them to make contact often results in them either never attending or quickly dropping out (Humphreys, 1999). A more active approach involves services promoting and hosting local meetings, holding explicit and structured conversations with clients, and setting care-planned goals around attending and engaging. Evidence shows that this kind of approach is usually more effective (Timko et al., 2006). Some specialist interventions have been developed to help clients engage with specific <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> organisations (eg, 12 -step facilitation, SMART Recovery Partnership programme and other structured programmes). However, these protocols require specialised training, which is usually delivered over eight to 12 weekly sessions in a group setting. This document provides keyworkers with a pragmatic intervention adapted from an evidence-based approach to facilitating access to <b>mutual</b> <b>aid,</b> using their existing skills in regular one-to-one key-work sessions. It focuses on holding explicit and structured conversations with clients, and setting care-planned goals around attending and engaging in <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> programmes. About the <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> self-assessment tool: This self-assessment tool has been developed to support local authority partnerships to improve their understanding of the availability of <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> locally, to identify any gaps that may exist and to highlight any potential barriers that may need to be overcome. The information gathered as a result of its undertaking will enable partnerships to develop a local action plan that ensures they are taking steps towards fostering effective links between treatment services and local <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> groups, and ensuring that all clients have the opportunity and encouragement to access a <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> programme of their choice. It is suggested that local commissioners of alcohol and drug services lead on this <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> self-assessment. The quality of the self-assessment is likely to be enhanced by completing it in close collaboration with local treatment providers, service user representatives and where possible representatives of local <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> groups.

40|$|According to a draft bill {{currently}} {{before the}} Italian Parliament, <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> societies {{should be considered}} as part of the Third Sector. And yet, when considering the primary aim of <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> societies (i. e. benefiting their members, rather than society at large), this position cannot be taken for granted.

This particular focus has exposed many prejudices about exchange in society, not least by providing evidence that <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> is far from a marginal or residual realm of daily life in advanced economies, and has resulted in the emergence of <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> as both a legitimate and serious focus for research to explore.;Through an in-depth case study of two urban areas in Leicester (England), the robustness of contemporary research will be tested by highlighting existing geographies of <b>mutual</b> <b>aid.</b> More fundamentally though, the discussion will depart from this into relatively uncharted territories by embracing the next significant phase of research on <b>mutual</b> <b>aid.</b> This involves engaging with a deeper and more qualitative understanding of the complex dynamics which underpin the geographies of <b>mutual</b> <b>aid,</b> and are themselves engaged through the process of mutual aid.;By focusing on the social dynamics of mutual aid; the internal dynamics of mutual aid; the notion of space, place and mutual aid; and the question as to why aid is so pervasive in the advanced economies, a more complicated and dynamic understanding of <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> in advanced economies emerges...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Using new {{empirical}} {{data from the}} UK focused on <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> and reciprocity, {{the purpose of this}} paper is to offer robust challenges to the logic and dominance of the commodification thesis. In finding <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> to be a significant coping strategy to get household tasks completed, in both affluent and deprived communities, the paper addresses the important question as to “why” <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> is so pervasive. Using qualitative insights as to “why” respondents engaged in <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> and reciprocity a considered response to this question, revolving around the instinctive and social nature of reciprocity, is made. Design/methodology/approach – The research draws on previous Household Work Practice Studies, which have been influential in exploring the geographies of community self-help. An in-depth semi-structured questionnaire, which adapts and develops previous successful approaches focused on <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> and volunteering, was employed across 100 households in two neighbouring wards in Leicester, UK. Findings – The research found that the non-commodified sphere of <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> was employed as a central coping strategy within the two communities investigated. The suggestion is that the extent of <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> in both deprived neighbourhoods and affluent neighbourhoods has been underestimated in previous research. However, the strength of the methodology resides with its understanding of the rationales being participation in <b>mutual</b> <b>aid.</b> This suggests that the natural and instinctive nature of reciprocity, and the social role that <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> plays within kin and non-kin relations, helps explain its pervasiveness in the advanced economies. Research limitations/implications – The methodology and methods were designed to explicitly harness a deep qualitative understanding of the relationship and attitudes that households adopt toward their informal coping strategies, and <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> in particular. Thus though this approach has uncovered rich qualitative data to inform the key arguments, the quantitative findings must be treated as speculative rather than conclusive. Practical implications – In undermining the commodification thesis, the paper concludes that alternate and better approaches toward harnessing “the economic” in society must be pursued by policy makers. Crucially economic policy which promotes co-operation over competition within society should be seen as earning the qualification of “advanced” economic practice. Originality/value – This is the first paper which explicitly looks at the pervasive nature of <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> within the advanced economies, using primary data from Leicester. The value is seen on three levels: first, the original arguments made which highlight the pervasiveness of this informal coping strategy; second, the manner with which these contemporary insights are then contextualised with reference to the wider literature; third, the way in which this research adds to the calls to fundamentally re-think our dominant attitudes (and policies) toward the commodified and non-commodified spheres of work in the advanced economies. </p...|$|R
40|$|The National <b>Mutual</b> <b>Aid</b> and Resource Management Initiative {{supports}} the National Incident Management System (NIMS) {{by establishing a}} comprehensive, integrated national <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> and resource management system that provides the basis to type, order, and track all (Federal, State, and local) response assets. For ease of ordering and tracking, response assets need to be categorized via resource typing. Resource typing is the categorization and description of resources that are commonly exchanged in disasters via <b>mutual</b> <b>aid,</b> by capacity and/or capability. Through resource typing, disciplines examine resources and identify the capabilities of a resource’s components (i. e., personnel, equipment, training).
