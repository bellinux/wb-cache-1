5|$|Bahuchara Mata is {{a patron}} goddess of the Hirja. In popular {{iconography}} she is often shown riding <b>a</b> <b>rooster</b> {{and carrying a}} sword, trident and a book. Various stories link Bahuchara to castration or other changes in physical sexual characteristics, sometimes {{as the result of}} her aiming curses against men. Bahuchara is believed to have originated as a mortal woman who became martyred. In one story, Bahuchara is attacked by a bandit who attempts to rape her, but she takes his sword, cuts off her breasts and dies. In another story, Bahuchara curses her husband when she catches him sneaking to the woods to engage in homoerotic behavior, causing his genitals to fall off and forcing him to dress as a woman.|$|E

His father Tirupathi Naidu was a rice trader and his mother Veera Veni was a homemaker. Sukumar {{was the youngest of}} the six children of Naidu and Veni. At the age of 6, following the slaughter of <b>a</b> <b>rooster</b> he loved, Sukumar began practising vegetarianism. He did his schooling from a Zilla Parishad High School, Razole and graduated with a master's degree in mathematics. He later worked as a mathematics and physics lecturer in Aditya Junior college, Kakinada. After six years, Sukumar and his junior Prakash Toleti decided to do something creative as they opined that their life has become too mundane as a lecturer.|$|E
5|$|Timber {{recruits}} a team {{of eight}} racers: Diddy Kong, the first recruit; Conker the Squirrel and Banjo the Bear, recruited by Diddy; Krunch the Kremling, Diddy's enemy who follows after him; and Tiptup the Turtle, T.T. the Stopwatch, Pipsy the Mouse, and Bumper the Badger, inhabitants of Timber's island. Aided by Taj, an Indian elephant-like genie residing on the island, they eventually complete all of Wizpig's challenges and confront Wizpig himself to a race and defeat him. Shortly afterwards, Drumstick is turned back into <b>a</b> <b>rooster,</b> and Wizpig leaves for his home planet, Future Fun Land. Fearing that Wizpig would again attempt to invade Timber's Island, the islanders travel to Future Fun Land for a second challenge. When Wizpig loses the second race, the rocket he rides on malfunctions and launches him to the moon. However, an additional cutscene reveals Wizpig's spaceship flying through the sky, unscathed.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rooster</b> Comb is <b>a</b> {{prominent}} ridge {{located in}} Henry W. Coe State Park, east of Morgan Hill, California and in Stanislaus County. Its name {{refers to the}} large fleshy red skin atop <b>a</b> <b>rooster's</b> head. The resemblance to <b>a</b> <b>rooster's</b> comb is evident by the large rock formations running {{the length of the}} ridge, separating it from the grassy slopes below. This contrast gives the illusion of <b>a</b> <b>rooster's</b> comb.|$|R

5|$|Mahitsielafanjaka (Mahitsy) {{became the}} {{residence}} of Andrianampoinimerina after he moved his capital from Ambohimanga to Antananarivo. Described in 1888 as the seat of ancestral spiritual authority at the Rova, the traditional sacrifice of <b>a</b> <b>rooster</b> during the ceremony of the Fandroana took place here, and ombiasy (astrologers) asked to perform sikidy (divination) for a sovereign would do so within this space. The building also formerly housed a major royal idol called Manjakatsiroa (or the entire collection of royal idols, according to another account) until the supposed public burning of all such relics by Queen RanavalonaII in 1869 following her conversion to Christianity. Built in 1796, the traditional wooden Mahitsy follows traditional architectural norms: the roof {{is supported by the}} central pillar, and two superimposed beds—the highest for the king and the other for his wives—are located in the northeast corner, the portion of the home reserved for royalty and the ancestors. These beds are raised high off the ground to protect the sleepers from a nocturnal attack. Items formerly on display in this building {{after the end of the}} Merina monarchy in 1897 until the destruction of the original structure in the 1995 fire included Andrianampoinimerina's filanzana (palanquin), several wooden trunks and a pot of jaka (zebu confit) said to date from the king's reign.|$|E
5|$|Some animals {{could also}} be {{regarded}} as dragonlike, such as rams. It was said that <b>a</b> <b>rooster,</b> a gander, or a turkeycock could grow a pair of little wings beneath their natural wings, thus becoming powerful dragons. A dragon rooster dug a hole beneath the threshold of his owner's house. As soon as dark clouds appeared, the rooster {{would go into the}} hole, and his spirit would fly out from his body into the clouds to fight with ale. One day the owner killed the rooster, and immediately went mad. Another dragon rooster, with two combs, would fall to the ground and lie as if dead during thunderstorms. The Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian and smok in Bulgarian) was regarded as a very beneficial animal. People avoided disturbing it in any way. The Aesculapian snake which inhabited a crop field or a vineyard was seen as its guardian. The snake was said to fly into the hail clouds and drive them away from its field or yard, or it dispersed the clouds by raising its head high in the air and hissing as strong as it could. In the region of Niš, the Aesculapian snakes were said to help the dragon boy in his fights against ale. If an Aesculapian snake attained a certain age, it would grow wings and become a dragon.|$|E

25|$|In one {{variant of}} the {{practice}} of Kapparot, the item to be donated to charity is <b>a</b> <b>rooster.</b> In this case, the rooster would be swung overhead while still alive. After the Kapparot ritual is concluded, the rooster would be treated as a normal kosher poultry product, i.e., it would be slaughtered according to the laws of shechita. It would then be given to charity for consumption at the pre-Yom Kippur meal. In modern times, this {{variant of the}} ritual is performed with <b>a</b> <b>rooster</b> for men and a hen for women.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of a deep history and strong African ties, symbols take on great meaning within Haitian society. For example, <b>a</b> <b>rooster</b> often {{represents}} Aristide and the red and blue colors of the Haitian flag often represent his Lavalas party. Many artists cluster in 'schools' of painting, such as the Cap-Haïtien school, which features depictions of daily life in the city, the Jacmel School, which reflects the steep mountains and bays of that coastal town, or the Saint-Soleil School, which is characterized by abstracted human forms and is heavily influenced by Vodou symbolism.|$|E

Tarō and Hyōe kill Tatsuta, Tarō's wife, and throw her body into a nearby pond; they hold <b>a</b> <b>rooster</b> over the corpse, and its crows, as Japanese superstition holds it would. The false escort prepared by Tarō and Hyōe to take Kan Shōjō away thus leaves with his passenger.|$|E
