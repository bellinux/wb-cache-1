5|$|Although Shishman's realm was {{nominally}} a Serbian client {{state for}} an unknown time, he retained his prior semi-independence {{and he was}} completely in charge of his lands.

In 1301–1302, Shishman provided political refuge to several of Nogai's relatives, including his grandson Qara-Kesek, who fled to Vidin along with a 3,000-strong cavalry and remained there until after 1325.
