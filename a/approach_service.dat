500|$|Svalbard Airport, Longyear, is {{the main}} airport serving the Svalbard archipelago. It {{is located on the}} south shore of Isfjord, with high terrain to the south, {{southeast}} and east. It has a single, 10/28 runway (roughly east–west) which is [...] long. The airport has an elevation of [...] above mean sea level (MSL), and has an aerodrome flight information service (AFIS), which is subordinate Bodø Air Traffic Control Center (Bodø ATCC). The airport is regarded as uncontrolled and does not provide <b>approach</b> <b>service.</b> On that day, all aircraft had used Runway 28, due to favorable wind conditions, climb-up conditions and short distance from the terminal.|$|E
50|$|Not all {{airports}} have a {{radar approach}} or terminal control available. In this case, the en-route center or a neighboring terminal or approach control may co-ordinate {{directly with the}} tower on the airport and vector inbound aircraft to a position from where they can land visually. At some of these airports, the tower may provide a non-radar procedural <b>approach</b> <b>service</b> to arriving aircraft handed over from a radar unit before they are visual to land. Some units also have a dedicated approach unit which can provide the procedural <b>approach</b> <b>service</b> either all the time or for any periods of radar outage for any reason.|$|E
50|$|The New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) {{is located}} in Westbury, New York. New York TRACON, also known as N90, is a {{consolidated}} TRACON meaning that a single location provides <b>approach</b> <b>service</b> for several large airports.|$|E
50|$|The RAAF {{provide both}} Tower and <b>Approach</b> <b>{{services}},</b> {{and in some}} cases a limited Centre (or en route) service. However, centre services are normally amalgamated with approach control. Two bases, Richmond and Edinburgh, provide only a Tower service, given their close proximity to Sydney and Adelaide respectively.

50|$|Current GBAS {{standards}} only augment {{a single}} GNSS frequency and support landings to Category-1 minima. These GBAS systems {{are identified as}} GBAS <b>Approach</b> <b>Service</b> Type C (GAST-C). Draft requirements for a GAST-D system are under review by ICAO. A GAST-D system will support operations to Category-III minima. Many organizations are conducting research in multi-frequency GBAS. Other efforts are exploring the addition of Galileo corrections for GBAS.|$|E
50|$|The DGA also {{undertakes}} {{the testing}} {{and assessment of}} equipment and military technologies. Test centres are distributed across France to carry out studies in advanced technologies: DGA Hydrodynamics, DGA Aero-engine Testing, DGA CBRN Defence, DGA Information superiority, DGA Land Systems, DGA Missiles Testing, DGA Naval Systems, DGA Flight Testing, DGA Aeronautical Systems, DGA Engineering & Integration. These services contribute to the validation of industrial equipment, {{but also to the}} proving of military systems for the programme directorates. Since 2004 DGA is organized into two subdirectorates for the coordination of programs dealing respectively with the inter-systems technical <b>approach</b> (<b>Service</b> of architecture inter-systems) and with technological developments (responsible for domains).|$|E

50|$|Svalbard Airport, Longyear, is {{the main}} airport serving the Svalbard archipelago. It {{is located on the}} south shore of Isfjord, with high terrain to the south, {{southeast}} and east. It has a single, 10/28 runway (roughly east-west) which is 2140 m long. The airport has an elevation of 28 m above mean sea level (MSL), and has an aerodrome flight information service (AFIS), which is subordinate Bodø Air Traffic Control Center (Bodø ATCC).

50|$|Local {{reference}} receivers {{are located}} around an airport at precisely surveyed locations. The signal {{received from the}} GPS constellation {{is used to calculate}} the position of the LAAS ground station, which is then compared to its precisely surveyed position. This data is used to formulate a correction message which is transmitted to users via a VHF data link. A receiver on the aircraft uses this information to correct the GPS signals it receives. This information is used to create an ILS-type display for aircraft approach and landing purposes. Honeywell’s CAT I system provides precision <b>approach</b> <b>service</b> within a radius of 23 NM surrounding a single airport. LAAS mitigates GPS threats in the Local Area to a much greater accuracy than WAAS and therefore provides a higher level of service not attainable by WAAS.LAAS's VHF uplink signal is currently slated to share the frequency band from 108 MHz to 118 MHz with existing ILS localizer and VOR navigational aids. LAAS utilizes a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technology in servicing the entire airport with a single frequency allocation. With future replacement of ILS, LAAS will reduce the congested VHF NAV band.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePrediction and {{analysis}} of GBAS integrity monitoring is important, especially at the airports where a GBAS station it to be installed. Based on existing standard documents and published research, we present a software tool for GBAS availability prediction. Simulations have been conducted that include single point, single approach path, and multiple repetitions of a same approach path in order to analyze the availability of GNSS signal integrity monitoring with a GBAS at LinZhi airport. The {{results show that the}} long-term 24 -h service availability figure at two typical single points along the approach path for GBAS <b>Approach</b> <b>Service</b> Type C (GAST C) is above 99. 999 % for each point, and for GBAS <b>Approach</b> <b>Service</b> Type D (GAST D) at three typical single points, it is lower than 99. 8 % for each point. The unavailability percentage over a 24 -h period is 0. 76 and 2. 40 % for GAST C and GAST D, respectively. The results of sensitivity tests show that the impact of the mask angle and the latitude on the GBAS availability at LinZhi airport are more important than that of the constellation. Our conclusions could also be of interest for the implementation of GBAS stations at other plateau airports...|$|E

That is because the uncertainty of the L 5 -only ionospheric delay estimation is larger than the L 1 -only ionospheric delay estimation.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{different ways}} of <b>approaching</b> <b>service</b> design, exploring what professional designers who say they design services are doing. First it reviews literature {{in the design and}} management fields, including marketing and operations. The paper proposes a framework that clarifies key tensions shaping the understanding of service design. It then presents an ethnographic study of three firms of professional service designers and details their work in three case studies. The paper reports four findings. The designers <b>approached</b> <b>services</b> as entities that are both social and material. The designers in the study saw service as relational and temporal and thought of value as created in practice. They <b>approached</b> designing a <b>service</b> through a constructivist enquiry in which they sought to understand the experiences of stakeholders and they tried to involve managers in this activity. The paper proposes describing designing for service as a particular kind of service design. Designing for service is seen as an exploratory process that aims to create new kinds of value relation between diverse actors within a socio-material configuration. This has implications for existing ways of understanding design and for research, practice and teaching...|$|R
