5|$|By 1928 the Southern Railway {{was well}} served by large 4-6-0 express {{passenger}} locomotives, but there was <b>an</b> <b>urgent</b> <b>need</b> for a class to fulfill intermediate roles throughout the system. Maunsell’s previous attempt at developing his predecessor’s L class for this task had proven a disappointment, and the Drummond D15 and L12 classes were approaching {{the end of their}} useful lives on these services. An entirely new secondary express passenger locomotive was required to operate over the main lines throughout the system including those that had relatively short turntables.|$|E
5|$|In acute liver failure, the {{development}} of severe encephalopathy strongly predicts short-term mortality, and is almost {{as important as the}} nature of the underlying cause of the liver failure in determining the prognosis. Historically, widely used criteria for offering liver transplantation, such as King's College Criteria, are of limited use and recent guidelines discourage excessive reliance on these criteria. The occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy in people with Wilson's disease (hereditary copper accumulation) and mushroom poisoning indicates <b>an</b> <b>urgent</b> <b>need</b> for a liver transplant.|$|E
30|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most common {{invasive}} cancer in women (Siegel et al., 2017), and the lungs {{are one of the most}} common metastatic organs (Lee, 1983; Quiet et al., 1995).

Therefore, there is <b>an</b> <b>urgent</b> <b>needed</b> for effective medical treatments for breast cancer metastasis.|$|R

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1941, when the Armored Force expanded, <b>an</b> <b>urgent</b> <b>need</b> for {{self-propelled}} artillery arose. Although a full-track chassis was preferred, the situation required the use of whatever vehicles were immediately available. The M3 Half-track was selected to carry a 105mm M2A1 howitzer. Although this design had originally been suggested in September 1941, {{it had not been}} taken up. However, the urgency of the requirement resulted in the approval by the Adjutant General and the construction of a prototype was authorized by OCM 17391, dated 31 October 1941; the new vehicle designated as the 105mm Howitzer Motor Carriage T19.|$|E
5|$|Kelsey Munro {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, suggesting that it is pessimistic and does not present any false hope. But he says pessimism {{is not the same}} thing as fatalism, and Hamilton believes there is still <b>an</b> <b>urgent</b> <b>need</b> for government intervention to avoid worst-case scenarios by reducing emissions. Munro also points out that some eminent climate scientists, like Princeton University's Michael Oppenheimer, remain optimistic that humanity will act before it is too late.|$|E

The first King of the Belgians, Leopold I of Belgium, created this soon after with his first government - a new Belgian Order. Two years after the independence, the young King officially founded the dynastic Order of Leopold.

5|$|When Nazi Germany conquered Poland in September 1939, it {{was faced}} with the {{disposition}} of the large Jewish population. In view of the German populace's tepid response to the orchestrated violence of Kristallnacht, the Nazis perceived <b>an</b> <b>urgent</b> <b>need</b> for films that would move German popular sentiment {{in favor of the}} Nazi Final Solution to the 'Jewish question'. Frustrated with the delays on the Jud Süß project, Goebbels ordered Fritz Hippler, the head of his film department, to sack Brauer and bring in Veit Harlan to take over as director.|$|E
5|$|While {{serving as}} {{director}} of CCMB during the end of 20th century, Singh realized <b>an</b> <b>urgent</b> <b>need</b> for assessment and conservation of the wildlife resources of India. To address that need, he conceptualized the Laboratory for conservation of endangered species (LaCONES) in 1998. The foundation stone of this laboratory was laid by the Minister of Environment and Forests, Government of India on 16September 2001. On 2February 2007, the laboratory was inaugurated and dedicated to the nation by then President of India A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, when a {{large chunk}} of stone fell from a statue near the main door, it became {{apparent}} that there was <b>an</b> <b>urgent</b> <b>need</b> for restoration of the west front. Detailed studies of the stonework and of conservation practices were undertaken under the cathedral architect, Alban D. R. Caroe and a restoration committee formed. The methods that were selected for conservation were those devised by Eve and Robert Baker. W. A. (Bert) Wheeler, clerk of works to the cathedral 1935–1978, had previously experimented with washing and surface-treatment of architectural carvings on the building and his techniques were among those tried on the statues.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, {{in order}} to meet <b>an</b> <b>urgent</b> <b>need</b> to {{increase}} the number of aircraft able to designate targets for laser-guided bombs, 10 GR1As and two T2As were upgraded with the capability to carry the TIALD laser designator pod and redesignated Jaguar GR1B or T2B respectively. TIALD equipped Jaguar GR1Bs were deployed to Italy in August to take part in Operation Deliberate Force against Bosnian Serb forces, being used to designate targets for RAF Harriers. During the Bosnian operations, a Jaguar of 41 Squadron carried out the first RAF bombing raid in Europe since the end of the Second World War fifty years before.|$|E
5|$|In Vienna {{during the}} first week in August, Kalākaua had made the {{acquaintance}} of The New York Times co-founder George Jones, who noticed the King had an interest in Thomas Edison's work with electric lighting. Returning to New York, Jones arranged for Kalākaua and Armstrong to visit Edison on September 25. The King expressed <b>an</b> <b>urgent</b> <b>need</b> for Honolulu to upgrade its street lighting, which at that time was provided by kerosene lamps. Edison demonstrated some electric light bulbs, and Kalākaua showed interest in the technical details. The Sun newspaper reported that Armstrong joked with Edison about generating electric power from Hawaiian volcanoes. They left the city by train on the following day for Philadelphia, staying there for a brief rest, and then heading south to Washington, D. C.|$|E
5|$|The {{design was}} adopted by an Act of Parliament in 1813, which {{permitted}} the commissioners to borrow £600,000 for building and construction. The street was intended to have commercial purposes and {{it was expected that}} a majority of the income would come from private capital. Nash took responsibility for design and valuation of all properties. Construction of the road resulted in demolishing numerous properties, disrupting trade and polluting the air with dust. Existing tenants had first offer to purchase leases on the new properties. The Treasury supported the proposal because, in the aftermath of the lengthy Napoleonic Wars, there was <b>an</b> <b>urgent</b> <b>need</b> for the government to create jobs. Government expenditure was low because the design relied heavily upon private developers, such as Nash himself. The buildings were to be let on 99-year leases, as was common at the time, and income could be recouped in the form of ground rent.|$|E
