50|$|The use {{of round}} rear and front {{sighting}} elements for aiming at round targets, like used in ISSF match shooting, {{takes advantage of}} the natural ability of the eye and brain to easily align concentric circles. Even for the maximum precision, there should still be a significant area of white visible around the bullseye and between the front and rear sight ring (if a front ring is being used). Since the best key to determining center is the amount of light passing through the apertures, a narrow, dim ring of light can actually be more difficult to work with than a larger, brighter ring. The precise sizes are quite subjective, and depend on both shooter preference and ambient lighting, which is why target rifles come with easily replaceable front sight inserts, and <b>adjustable</b> <b>aperture</b> mechanisms.|$|E

5000|$|Cyclops emits {{beams of}} energy from his eyes, {{described}} as [...] "optic blasts", {{which have the}} appearance of red light and deliver massive concussive force.

The beams constantly emanate from his eyes involuntarily, and can generally only be stopped by his own eyelids, or by shielding his eyes with [...] "ruby-quartz", a translucent mineral; Cyclops wears ruby-quartz as lenses in glasses or in his visor, which is generally the only way for him to safely see without inadvertently damaging his surroundings. The beams' involuntary nature has been explained as a psychological shortcoming that resulted from childhood trauma.

50|$|By 1902, {{the paper}} prints had {{accumulated}} to 1413 {{according to the}} Annual Report of the Librarian of Congress. By {{the time of their}} rediscovery in the early 1940s, over 3000 were stored within a vault of the copyright office. Librarian Howard Walls made the discovery and described the scene this way,That vault had been open to all kinds of weather, but the grating was over a shaft so it never rained in there, it never snowed in there. And the successive wrappings on these paper rolls protected them. Each time it was wrapped around, the picture underneath was protected.Walls recruited a National Archives (NARA) motion picture engineer, Carl Louis Gregory, to help get the movies back into shape for screening. Gregory observed the fragile state of the paper, some of which had sprocket perforations punched through. Sprocket holes or not, the paper could never travel through a projector or automated printer without being shredded.Gregory designed a system that adopted many of the traits involved with shooting animation in that era. He “modified a process optical printer” and was able to exchange sprocket heads and pull down pins that were necessary to advance the film and yet not tear it to pieces. An <b>adjustable</b> <b>aperture</b> plate was added to frame images that had been produced by a variety of cameras without any uniform standardization. The transfer of the paper prints was done at one exposure setting without any consideration for the variations in image density of the negative, so Gregory adjusted his lighting that reflected off the print to maximize the information captured to a new film negative. There is no record of the film format used to recapture the paper prints.|$|E

5000|$|Starks {{claimed that}} Nishika {{also made a}} 3 lens camera, {{but there is no}} {{evidence}} that such a camera ever existed outside his article. It is interesting that some of the Nishika [...] "dealers" [...] claimed that the Nimslo had only 3 lenses. The confusion on the part of Michael Starks may stem from the introduction about a year later of the 3 lens Trilogy, which sported a built in electronic flash and motorized film advance, and was originally marketed through a system very similar to the multilevel scheme used by Nishika. The same camera was later renamed to Image Tech 3D 1000 and marketed through more traditional channels. Several other three-lens cameras were released, such as the 3D wizard, 3D magic, 3DFX, and Kalimar, some of which sported more modern features such as built-in electronic flash and motorized film advance, but lacked the auto-exposure features of the Nimslo. The 3D trio featured 3 element coated glass lenses, built in flash, motorized film advance, automatic exposure control, compatibility with DX coded ASA 100, 200 and 400 film, and a built in protective lens cover, making it the closest three-lens equivalent to the Nimslo. These 3 lens cameras gave more pictures per roll of film, 16 [...] for 24 exposure roll rather than the 12 yielded by Nimslo/Nishika and had less ghosting, but also less depth. There were other 4 lens Nimslo clones as well, such as the 3DNext and the Rittai. Like the Nishika, several of these were marketed through multilevel schemes, often in Asian countries, occasionally being the basis of a scam. In 2005 the Canadian firm Snap 3D began selling several 2 lens and 5 lens lenticular cameras made by US technology Ltd in Hong Kong. The 5 lens cameras were particularly odd producing five images that were 29.94 mm high and from 24.75 to 26.33 mm wide, all five images having a different width. These were deluxe cameras, featuring glass lenses, adjustable focus with rangefinder, adjustable shutter speeds 1/125, 1/60, 1/30 sec. and [...] "B", continuously <b>adjustable</b> <b>aperture</b> from f/5.6 to f22 and a spirit level. They also had automatic film loading and motorized film advance. Indeed, these cameras were so far removed from the Nimslo, that it might be stretching things to call them Nimslo clones. Snap 3D no longer sells these cameras and as of May 2012 no longer does lenticular printing due to failure of their machine.|$|E

50|$|Target {{aperture}} sights {{are designed}} for maximum precision. The rear sight element (often called diopter) is usually a large disk (up to 1 inch or 2.5 cm in diameter) with a small hole in the middle, and is placed close to the shooter's eye.

Typical modern target shooting diopters offer windage and elevation corrections in 2 mm to 4 mm increments at 100 m. Some International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) (Olympic) shooting events require this precision level for sighting lines, since the final score of the top competitors last shots series is expressed in tenths of scoring ring points.|$|R
3000|$|Adjustable iris lenses can be manual or {{automatic}}. For {{the manual}} lenses, user selects a fixed setting, while the automatic ones feature a dynamical adjustment following a measurement.

Alternatively, when the measurement occurs outside the lens unit, it is called a DC iris and an external signal is used to drive the lens.

The more the iris is opened, the more light it lets in and the brighter the image will be. A correct iris control is crucial to obtain the optimum image quality, including a balanced contrast and resolution and minimum noise.|$|R
