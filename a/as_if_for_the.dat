5|$|The {{final version}} of the game was co-developed by Square Enix and HexaDrive, a company created by former Capcom staff members. As the new form of The 3rd Birthday had {{transformed}} into a third-person shooter, Square Enix wanted staff members with experience at developing such games, and then-company CEO Yoichi Wada recommended HexaDrive to Tabata. As multiple HexaDrive staff members had also worked on fellow shooter , Tabata agreed to the collaboration. While aiming for a high quality product, the team designed the game <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> PlayStation 3 home console, then worked to fit it onto the PSP. During development, the team sought creative help from the team developing Final Fantasy XIII for the visual design. The team had previous experimented with shooters with , but this time they wanted to create something closer to a third-person shooter. The team was assembled by Tabata based on their development experience with action games. While working inside the control and hardware limitations of the title, the team created firearms and the lock-on mechanic as the fundamental attack action, instead of the free-roaming style of a standard third-person shooter. While designing levels to function with the game's Overdive system, the team considered what the level would hold, how often players would utilize the function, the difficulty of levels, and the positioning and strength of enemies. During development, a questionnaire was circulated around company staff concerning the character Aya, to find out which of the planned features was popular. One of those that survived in the final game was Aya's clothes being damaged when she was hit by an enemy, which was used to emphasize her sexuality. Nomura {{was among the first to}} suggest this feature originally.|$|E
25|$|Life {{in his own}} monastery proved no more congenial than before. For this Abelard {{himself was}} partly responsible. He took a sort of {{malicious}} pleasure in irritating the monks. <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sake of a joke, he cited Bede {{to prove that the}} believed founder of the monastery of St Denis, Dionysius the Areopagite had been Bishop of Corinth, while the other monks relied upon the statement of the Abbot Hilduin that he had been Bishop of Athens. When this historical heresy led to the inevitable persecution, Abelard {{wrote a letter to the}} Abbot Adam in which he preferred to the authority of Bede that of Eusebius of Caesarea's Historia Ecclesiastica and St. Jerome, according to whom Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth, was distinct from Dionysius the Areopagite, bishop of Athens and founder of the abbey, though, in deference to Bede, he suggested that the Areopagite might also have been bishop of Corinth. Adam accused him of insulting both the monastery and the Kingdom of France (which had Denis as its patron saint); life in the monastery grew intolerable for Abelard, and he was finally allowed to leave.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the lyrics, Madonna had commented: [...] "I like innuendo, I like irony, I {{like the}} way things can be taken on {{different}} levels." [...] This statement highlighted the ambiguity of the lyrics of the song, which is hung on the word 'like'. Rooksby interpreted {{the meaning of the}} song in different ways to different people. He said that for women who were really virgins, the song encouraged them to hold their compose before they engaged in their very first sexual act. For sexually experienced girls, the song meant that {{they would be able to}} re-live the feelings of their first sexual encounter all over again. For the boys, the song presented a narcissistic image of them making the girl forget her past encounters and enjoy the sexual act <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time.|$|E
60|$|Both women stood {{a moment}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> aghast; <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Ferguson {{property}} was equally involved.|$|R
60|$|Stephen {{dismounted}} {{and walked}} round the yard admiring everything. She {{did not feel}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> intruding; <b>for</b> <b>the</b> gateway was wide open.|$|R
6000|$|Seeing {{that she}} had put out her hand, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> begging <b>for</b> <b>the</b> truth, he added: [...] "How can your brother marry her--she's married!" ...|$|R
500|$|A Dutch {{opinion poll}} {{conducted}} in October 1947 placed Han van Meegeren’s popularity {{second in the}} nation, behind only the Prime Minister's and slightly ahead of Prince Berhard, the husband of Princess Juliana. The Dutch people viewed Van Meegeren as a cunning trickster who had successfully fooled the Dutch art experts and, more importantly, Hermann Göring himself. In fact, according to a contemporary account, Göring was informed that his [...] "Vermeer" [...] was actually a forgery and [...] " [...] looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{first time he had}} discovered there was evil in the world". Lopez indicates that Han van Meegeren's defense during his trial in Amsterdam was a masterpiece of trickery, forging his own personality into a true Dutchman eager to trick his critics and also the Dutch people by pretending that he sold Christ and the Adulteress, a fake Vermeer, to Göring because he wanted to teach the Nazi a lesson. Van Meegeren {{remains one of the most}} ingenious art counterfeiters of the 20th century. After his trial, however, he declared, [...] "My triumph as a counterfeiter was my defeat as [...] creative artist." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{looked around}} and, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time, missed Louise. He came toward them at once.|$|E
50|$|Numbers 6 through 10 do not inflect. Numbers 6 through 8 {{are simply}} 1 through 3 <b>as</b> <b>if</b> inflected <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ozo- noun class, with hambo- prefixed.|$|R
60|$|Batley {{turned to}} Gladwyne, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> support, and <b>the</b> latter assumed his finest air.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and it was}} she whom I was seeking." [...] He paused, {{and added}} slowly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> merely <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sake of {{dwelling}} on the words, [...] "I have found her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hm!--weel--" [...] {{and then}} stopped, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> purpose of mature consideration. The {{audience}} {{waited for the}} announcement of the oracle's opinion.|$|E
60|$|He {{stared at}} her admiringly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time realizing her true worth. For Mr Murdoch was a great patron of sport.|$|E
60|$|Arrived at {{the summit}} of the plateau, the leading {{horseman}} trotted to its eastern edge, and halted <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> purpose of surveying the position.|$|E
60|$|Barney looked timidly at Fagin, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> permission; <b>the</b> Jew {{remaining}} silent, and not {{lifting his}} eyes from the ground, he retired; and presently returned, ushering in Nancy; who was decorated with the bonnet, apron, basket, and street-door key, complete.|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't you say, Blossom, {{that one}} of the canoes was much behind the others, and that a warrior in that canoe DID look up toward this grove, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> searching <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cabin?" [...] asked Dorothy.|$|R
60|$|Crouching close {{against the}} wall, she stood mute till {{the figure was}} very near. She was {{in the shadow of}} an angle, and the man paused, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> looking <b>for</b> <b>the</b> person who called for help.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but he's {{going on}} business," [...] persisted Mavering, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{pleasure}} {{he found in}} fencing with the air, [...] "and he can't look after me." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{looked at}} each other <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time they now {{realised}} the fact, and Kendricks said, [...] "Why, of course we have! We didn't know anybody." ...|$|E
60|$|With which words, and {{knocking}} his hat {{over his eyes}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> purpose of shutting out even {{a glimpse of the}} dreadful visitation, Mr Brass rushed from the house and hurried away.|$|E
60|$|Linda, disappointed, {{went out}} quietly; and Giselle sat on unbelieving, lost, dazed, patient, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> waiting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{confirmation}} of the incredible. The hopeless blackness of the clouds seemed part of a dream, too. She waited.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{like that}} little story, and shall {{always think of}} it when I hear the chick-a-dee-dee." [...] Daisy sat {{a moment with a}} {{thoughtful}} look in her eyes; then she said slowly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> sorry <b>for</b> <b>the</b> words: ...|$|R
60|$|Jack's eyes twinkled {{more than}} ever as he helped Jill settle herself in the boat, {{and then with a}} whoop he tore over <b>the</b> beach, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> practising <b>for</b> <b>the</b> race which was to come off in the afternoon.|$|R
6000|$|The {{landlord}} {{was called}} in, and told Harry was a friend, whereupon he barred {{the door and}} closed the shutters, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> night. Then turning to Colonel Wyndham, whom alone he knew, he said: ...|$|E
60|$|The last dozen {{words were}} spoken {{in a loud}} tone, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> benefit of the {{stranger}} in the rear; but instead of waiting to hear more the latter turned abruptly {{and walked toward the}} package with a green covering {{at the end of the}} platform.|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} me doubtfully, appealingly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{first time in his}} life he had been given a glimpse of that dilemma of {{consequences}} which his nature never recognises. I thought he was going to give in. Suddenly, to my horror, Dan growled, [...] "Play the man!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're playin' {{the fool}} to stand here <b>as</b> <b>if</b> waitin' <b>for</b> <b>the</b> painted scoundrels {{to do their}} will. We {{have no reason to}} despair because they have {{captured}} some unfortunate; but should be all the more determined to worst them." ...|$|R
6000|$|Let us draw nigh and {{mingle with}} this {{singular}} act of worship. Elder Brewster, with his well-worn Geneva Bible in hand, leads the thanksgiving in words which, though {{thousands of years}} old, seem <b>as</b> <b>if</b> written <b>for</b> <b>the</b> occasion of that hour: ...|$|R
60|$|Here he stopped, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> {{relief from}} <b>the</b> terrors {{of his own}} description. After being silent for a few moments, he pursued his story.|$|R
60|$|Syme's {{laughter}} at {{all this}} had about it a wild weakness of relief. He laughed {{at the idea of}} the paralytic Professor being really a young actor dressed up <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> foot-lights. But he felt that he would have laughed as loudly if a pepperpot had fallen over.|$|E
6000|$|For a {{few moments}} after he mounted his horse Cavanagh looked about the place <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> last time--now up at the hill, now down at the meadow, and last of all at the stream. [...] "I hope you'll enjoy this station as much as I have, Swenson. It's one of the prettiest on the whole forest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doubtless {{it is his}} duty. 'Twas said above, a royal {{party was}} moving on the river; though I passed the troops but two miles from this spot." [...] The {{latter part of the}} {{sentence}} was hardly audible, and it was spoken more {{in the manner of a}} soliloquy, than <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ears of her companions.|$|E
6000|$|Seeing, as {{she patted}} the pillow into its {{place on the}} bolster, {{that he was still}} looking at her <b>as</b> <b>if</b> waiting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of her reply, she gave it a great poke in the middle, and asked, 'How could I help myself?' ...|$|R
60|$|Beckendorff {{started and}} looked round, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first moment aware that any being had heard him.|$|R
