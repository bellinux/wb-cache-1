5|$|Dennie {{was born}} on August 30, 1768, in Boston, Massachusetts to Joseph Dennie, {{a member of a}} well-to-do {{merchant}} family, and his wife Mary Green, whose father was Bartholomew Green, Jr. The Greens were a prominent printing family in colonial America; the progenitor of the family, Samuel Green, emigrated from England with John Winthrop {{and was one of the}} first printers in the colonies. Having moved to Lexington at the age of seven, Dennie returned to Boston in 1783 to study bookkeeping and later clerk in a counting house. He began preparing to enter Harvard College in 1785, under the guidance of Reverend Samuel West. West had a significant impact on Dennie, fostering his pupil's interest in literature, as well as instilling in Dennie <b>a</b> <b>decidedly</b> pro-British mindset.|$|E

5|$|Like {{his father}} before him, Alec Waugh {{went to school}} at Sherborne, and, it was presumed by the family that Evelyn would follow, but in 1915, the school asked Alec to leave, after a {{homosexual}} relationship came to light. Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an officer, and, while awaiting confirmation of his commission, wrote The Loom of Youth (1917), a novel of school life, which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne. The public sensation caused by Alec's novel so offended the school that it became impossible for Evelyn to go there. In May 1917, much to his annoyance, {{he was sent to}} Lancing College, in his opinion, <b>a</b> <b>decidedly</b> inferior school.|$|E
5|$|The {{wood turtle}} is {{omnivorous}} and {{is capable of}} eating on land or in water. On an average day, a wood turtle will move , <b>a</b> <b>decidedly</b> long distance for a turtle. Many other animals that live in its habitat {{pose a threat to}} it. Raccoons are over-abundant in many places and are a direct threat to all life stages of this species. Inadvertently, humans cause a large number of deaths through habitat destruction, road traffic, farming accidents, and illegal collection. When unharmed, it can live for up to 40 years in the wild and 58 years in captivity.|$|E

25|$|As a young man, Russell had <b>a</b> <b>decidedly</b> {{religious}} bent, himself, as {{is evident}} in his early Platonism. He longed for eternal truths, as he makes clear in his famous essay, , widely regarded as a masterpiece of prose, but a work that Russell came to dislike. While he rejected the supernatural, he freely admitted that he yearned for a deeper meaning to life.|$|E
25|$|Consisting {{of twenty}} days worth of protests, the Revolution {{triggered}} new presidential and parliamentary elections in Georgia, which established the United National Movement {{as the dominant}} ruling party. Following the Rose Revolution, Georgia pursued <b>a</b> <b>decidedly</b> pro-Western foreign policy and declared European and Euro-Atlantic integration as its main priority; this change in trajectory contributed to Georgia's tensions with Russia, which continue to this day.|$|E

25|$|In lieu of the Enlightenment {{belief in}} {{historical}} progress and stages espoused by Hegel (often in a racist, Eurocentric manner, {{as in his}} Lectures on the Philosophy of History), Marx pursues in these research notes <b>a</b> <b>decidedly</b> empirical approach to analyzing historical changes and different modes of production, emphasizing without forcing them into a teleological paradigm the rich varieties of communal productions throughout {{the world and the}} critical importance of collective working-class antagonism in the development of capitalism.|$|E

25|$|H. M. Robertson, in {{his book}} Aspects of Economic Individualism, argued against the {{historical}} and religious claims of Weber. Robertson points out that capitalism began to flourish not in Britain, but in 14th century Italy, <b>a</b> <b>decidedly</b> different epoch. Since this is true, then the rise of capitalism cannot be attributed to Adam Smith, the Protestant Reformation, etc. In fact, Robertson goes further, and states that what happened in Britain was rather a retrogression from what was achieved in Italy centuries earlier.|$|E
