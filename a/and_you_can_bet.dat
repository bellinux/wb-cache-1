5000|$|The Guinness Game {{is notable}} for the host's {{unprecedented}} sign-off: Hilton and Galloway both normally ended each episode by saying [...] "We hope you join us when The Guinness Game returns in exactly 167 hours, 31 minutes <b>and</b> 15 seconds...and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> on that!"

6000|$|... "You're right, Peg, {{only you}} mustn't take it so hard. Things {{will work out}} all right. Homans and I were talking about that to-day. You see, Worry wants the boys to elect a captain soon. But perhaps he has not confided in you youngsters. He will suggest that you elect Homans or me. Well, I won't run for the place, so it'll be Homans. He's the man to captain us, that's certain. Graves thinks, though, that he can pull the wires and be elected captain. He's way off. Besides, Peg, he's making a big mistake. Worry doesn't like him, and when he finds out about this break in {{training}} we'll have a new third-baseman. No doubt Blake will play the bag. Graves is the only drag in Worry's baseball machine now, and he'll not last.... So, Peg, don't think any more about it. Mind you, the whole team circles round you. You're the pivot, and as sure as you're born you'll be Wayne's captain next year. That's something for you {{to keep in mind}} and work for. If Graves keeps after you--hand him one! That's not against rules. Punch him! If Worry knew the truth he would pat you on the back for slugging Graves. Cheer up, Peg! Even if Graves has got all the kids on his side, which I doubt, Homans and I are with <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> just <b>bet</b> that Worry Arthurs will side with us.... Now run along, for I must study." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{it was one}} of my frock-coat days. I'd been to see a {{man about}} {{tutoring}} his son, and by a merciful dispensation of Providence there was a fellow living in the same boarding-house with me who was about my build and had a frock-coat, and he had lent it to me. At least, he hadn't exactly lent it to me, but I knew where he kept it and he was out at the time. There was nothing the matter with my appearance. Quite the young duke, I assure you, laddie, down to the last button. 'Is Lady Lichenhall at home?' I asked. 'No,' said the maid, 'nobody of that name here. This is Lady Lakenheath's house.' So, you see, I had a bit of luck at the start, because the names were a bit alike. Well, I got the maid to show me in somehow, <b>and,</b> once in <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> I talked for all I was worth. Kept up a flow of conversation about being misdirected and coming to the wrong house. Went away, and called a few days later. Gradually wormed my way in. Called regularly. Spied on their movements, met 'em at every theatre they went to, and bowed, and finally got away with Millie before her aunt knew what was happening or who I was or what I was doing or anything." ...|$|R

[...] "All the time," [...] I says, [...] "that you're talking away of an evening, Jerry's seeing visions of a little woman sitting in your chair. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> we don't enter into them visions.

5000|$|Besides {{his smooth}} and deep voice and his afro (which slowly shrunk {{over the years}} as hairstyle tastes changed), Cornelius was best known for the catchphrase that he used to close the show: [...] "... <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> your last money, it's all gonna be a stone gas, honey! I'm Don Cornelius, and as always in parting, we wish you love, peace and soul!" [...] After Cornelius's departure, it was {{shortened}} to [...] "...and as always, we wish you love, peace and soul!" [...] and it was used through the most recent new episodes in 2006. Another introductory phrase which he often used was: [...] "We got another sound comin' out of Philly that's a sure 'nough dilly".|$|E

5000|$|Adam Hughes of Yahoo! TV {{reported}} that Branson {{had become a}} fan favorite, calling him a [...] "crowd pleasing detective", {{and that was the}} reason for his return in August 2011. He wrote: [...] "Ronans story is a typically twisted tale of intrigue, misunderstanding, betrayal and redemption. The basic gist is that he was stolen from his mother, Nina Webster, when he was just a baby and promptly disappeared from the shows landscape." [...] Hughes also wrote of Ronan returning to solve Diane Jenkins (Maura West) murder, saying: [...] "All of this is great theater, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> that producers and writers will milk the story for all its worth, potentially allowing Branson the opportunity to cultivate his character into something more permanent." [...] When Bransons exit in November 2012 was announced, Jamey Giddens of Zap2it wrote: [...] "Jeff Branson has had more stints on The Young and the Restless than Sharon Newman in the funny farm." [...] He also said that it was a [...] "bummer" [...] to see Branson leave, as he thought the characters relationship with Phyllis was [...] "smoking hot". In 2013, Branson received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of Ronan.|$|E

[...] JesusFreakHideout gave it 4 stars and commented, [...] "If I Had One Chance To Tell You Something is a wonderful addition to Rebecca St. James's impressive career. Pop/rock and RSJ fans alike should find a lot to enjoy about this record, and it's a real treat to hear her return {{to the type of}} music-making that caused us {{to fall in love with}} her a decade ago." [...] ChristianityToday favored the album saying, [...] "This album's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> that as much as half of If I Had One Chance will do well on Christian radio. The challenge will be for St. James will be to avoid reverting to old material, continuing to press forward and try new things in her words and music. Nevertheless, this is a great recovery from her songwriting hiatus. Rebecca St. James is back, as inviting and rocking as she ever was." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a {{national}} poll released in December 2011, Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind asked voters whether they “support or oppose changing {{the federal law}} to allow sports betting” in their respective states. Just as many voters approved (42%) as opposed (42%) allowing sports betting. However, voters who already live in households where family members (including themselves) engage in sports betting had a strongly favored legalization of sports betting (71%-23%), while voters in households where sports betting is not an activity, opposed legalization (46%-36%). Peter J. Woolley, {{professor of political science}} and director of the poll commented on the findings, “Gambling has become, for good or ill, {{a national}} industry, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> that politicians and casinos all over the country are closely following New Jersey’s plans.”In a different study released by FDU’s PublicMind in October 2011, results showed that New Jersey voters thought legalizing sports betting in New Jersey was a good idea. Half of New Jersey voters (52%) said that they approved the idea of legalizing sports betting at Atlantic City casinos and racetracks, 31% opposed it. In addition, there was a significant gender split: a majority of men approved of the idea by a wide margin (65-21), while only 39% of women approved and 41% opposed.The October results were stable, reflecting an earlier poll in April 2011 where New Jersey voters approved the legalization of sports betting in the state by a margin of 53%-30%. However, nearly two-thirds (66%) of voters were not aware of the upcoming statewide referendum on the issue. Age proved to be a divide: voters between the ages 18 and 34 were more likely to approve of sports betting than were older voters. Dr. Woolley commented: [...] "But... younger voters... are far less likely to vote than other voters... As always, a lot depends on who actually shows up to vote." ...|$|E
