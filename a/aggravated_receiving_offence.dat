Therefore, to mitigate ICI is very important issue in cellular system. To deal with ICI problem, fractional frequency reuse (FFR) is introduced. FFR is an interference management technique. It separates each cell into inner cell and outer cell. Then, it allocates whole system bandwidth to inner cell and different frequency partition to each sector of outer cell. By doing this, outer cell users can ignore interferences from adjacent cells. So, the receiving performance of the cell edge users can be fairly increased. However, using FFR technique has a fatal side effect. In order to use different frequency partition among three sectors of outer cell, they can use {{only a third of}} the whole system bandwidth. Then, the reduction of available bandwidth reduces the system throughput directly. To solve this problem, we propose a new FFR method that allocates partially overlapped frequency partition to each sector of outer cell...|$|R

She made several of them acquainted with her mother, who, after a timorous reticence, found them very conversable, with a range of topics, however, that shocked her American sense of decorum. One Dutch lady talked with such manly freedom, and with such untrammelled intimacy, that she was obliged to send Boyne and Lottie about their business, upon an excuse that was not apparent to the Dutch lady. She only complimented Mrs. Kenton upon her children and their devotion to each other, and when she learned that Ellen was also her daughter, ventured the surmise she was not long married.|$|R

30|$|The {{design of}} low-complexity {{synchronization}} schemes using either symbol-rate or frame-rate sampling is, therefore, highly motivated in UWB {{in order to}} reduce the implementation complexity. One simple approach for synchronization in impulse radio is based on match-filtering the received signal with a locally generated â€˜clean templateâ€™ and peak-picking the correlation samples. Evidently, the reference template must encompass multipath channel effect which is unknown at synchronization, thus needing a cumbersome task of channel estimation. A scheme, known as timing with dirty templates (TDT), was proposed in [14] to tackle this issue by utilizing a pair of successive symbol-long segments of the received signal, where one segment serves as template for the other. However, the main drawback of this approach is its poor performance due to the noise on noise effect from the dirty templates. An algorithm using orthogonal pulses in an alternative manner and then applying TDT algorithm is presented in [15]. Relying on periodic transmission of non-zero mean symbols, joint timing and template recovery algorithms via energy detection have been developed in [16, 17], with universal applicability in the presence of ISI and multiuser interference (MUI). However, this asymmetric modulation <b>aggravates</b> the <b>received</b> signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thus deteriorating bit error rate (BER) performance. Also, these algorithms need much longer sequence for reliable synchronization. Another class of synchronization algorithms capitalizes on the fine correlation properties of binary codes. One such algorithm with improved performance using fewer number of symbols is proposed in [18], which can be utilized under both non-data-aided (NDA) and DA scenarios. Exploiting the discriminative nature of similar binary codes, several other timing algorithms resilient to different types of interferences such as IFI and ISI [19], MUI [20], near-far problem [21], and a low-complexity demodulator [22] have also been proposed.|$|R

40|$|This {{study shows}} {{the pattern of}} {{sentencing}} {{for a range of}} domestic violence offences in the NSW Local and District Criminal Courts, and identifies the characteristics which influence whether offenders guilty of domestic violence- related assault receive a sentence of imprisonment. Method: Data were sourced from the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Researchâ€™s recorded criminal incident database and Reoffending Database. Domestic violence-related offences finalised in NSW Local and District Courts between January 2008 and June 2009 were identified by reference to the original police report and the use of domestic violence-specific law part codes. A multivariable model was developed to identify the factors influential in the sentencing of domestic assault offenders. Results: Offenders found guilty of a domestic violence-related assault are more likely to receive a prison sentence if: the assault caused significant harm, the offender has a concurrent offence at the court appearance, a prior prison episode, a prior conviction for a violent offence, has breached an AVO in the previous two years, is male or Indigenous. Conclusion: Domestic violence appears before the courts in many forms, from the most serious assaults to property damage and offensive language. The penalties <b>received</b> for these <b>offences</b> are equally diverse. The factors which influence whether a domestic violence-related assault offender will be sentenced to prison generally reflect the severity of the offence and the criminal history of the offender...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{connection}} between industrial protest and the crime committed in Wellington during the 1913 General Strike. The possibility that {{the ways in which}} the criminal law was implemented changed in response to the strike has also been examined. The crimes focused upon include violence, theft, anti-state actions, seditious utterances, verbal abuse, threatening behaviour and desertion. Crimes committed in Wellington during and in the two years before the start of the strike have been researched. In all, 1757 criminal charges for violence, theft or potential anti-state actions are studied. Some comparisons are made with violence, crime, prosecutions and policing during the 1890 Maritime Strike and the 1951 Waterfront Dispute. International research on crime, protest, prosecutions, policing and industrial disputes is also discussed to provide a basis for the New Zealand case study. Six hypotheses from the international research are tested against the data gathered on Wellington. Three of these hypotheses concern crime as protest by strikers. The other three hypotheses focus on the uses made of the criminal law during industrial disputes (through arrests, prosecutions, verdicts, sentences, the refusal of bail, and jury trials). Offences by strikers against their employers and against strike-breakers are found to have been surprisingly infrequent in Wellington in late 1913. Crime as protest by strikers and sympathisers against special constables was very common. There is no evidence, however, that theft was used as a form of protest during the strike. The response of the police to the 1913 strike and the related disorder was to intensify their efforts to control certain types of offences, in particular, socially threatening "crimes" associated with the strike. Overall, the police displayed a surprising degree of restraint in making arrests. The analysis of conviction and sentencing patterns indicates that the Wellington judiciary responded firmly to the period of disorder and heightened social tensions, but that this response was neither malicious nor indiscriminate. The criminal law was not used as a means to remove (through conviction and imprisonment) all "undesirables" or potential "troublemakers" from the streets of Wellington. Many of those who were convicted of strike related <b>offences</b> <b>received</b> longer terms of imprisonment and larger fines than were imposed prior to the strike. These sentences were intended to deter potential offenders and prevent further disorder, as well as to punish those caught. The penalties were firm but not as severe as the law allowed...|$|R
