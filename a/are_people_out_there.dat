500|$|... e.The immense {{scope of}} The Century caused {{headaches}} for those developing it. It survived three {{major changes in}} narrative approach, three different executive producers, and various attempts to axe the entire project. By the time it aired, {{all of the people}} interviewed for their anecdotes of World War I had died. Jennings, though, downplayed criticism of the program's rocky history. [...] "Name me a news organization that doesn't have some degree of turmoil on a major project," [...] he said. [...] "What people care about in The New York Times is what gets in the paper. It's the same with us. There <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who think their job is to set the bar for us, but the bar for me is set by the audience, and I think there is a real hunger out there from everyone I encounter to relive and experience and learn from what's gone on over the last 100 years." ...|$|E

"You Can't Win" [...] was {{originally}} written and performed during the pre-Broadway Baltimore {{run of the}} stage version of The Wiz in 1974, sung by the chorus of Winkies, the Wicked Witch's slaves.

The singer added that the song was also about [...] "the feeling that there <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who don't actively hold you back as much as they work quietly on your insecurities so that you hold yourself back". [...] "You Can't Win" [...] opens with the lines, [...] "You can't win, you can't break even, and you can't get out of the game. People keep sayin', things are gonna change, but they look just like they're staying the same." [...] William F. Brown, who wrote the book for the Broadway musical, stated that such verses made [...] "You Can't Win" [...] a [...] "black message song".

2500|$|From there, word-of-mouth spread. In 2003, the {{non-profit}} Foundation for US Historical Monuments {{was formed to}} help bring about the monument's creation. After their efforts faltered, an anonymous [...] group of Wall Street bankers who lost friends and co-workers in the [...] 9/11 attacks learned about his sculpture. They commissioned Blumberg to build a large-scale version for a monument near Ground Zero, paying $500,000 for the work. The Gary Sinese Foundation and the Green Beret Foundation supported the effort to build the monument. No public funds were used. Two of the individual Wall Street supporters said they were asked by families and friends {{if there was a}} place that individuals could go to remember the U.S. troops overseas who daily combat potential terrorist threats. [...] "We wanted to do something for the special operations community and all military service branches, because every day since 9/11, we've had to look at that hole in the ground," [...] one of the private backers says. [...] "What everyone needs to know is: There <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> like this team, like the Green Berets, that are willing to sacrifice at all costs for them."

2500|$|Detective Constable (DC) Jennifer Bell, who had {{previously}} been seconded to the Metropolitan Police Service's SO15 Counter Terrorism Command, was brought into the inquiry to examine hours of recovered CCTV footage for sightings of Nelson. DC Bell, who had also used her skills {{in the aftermath of}} the 7 July 2005 London bombings and the 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack, eventually located an image of Nelson taken inside a Scotmid Co-operative store on Manse Road, Newmains at 5.30pm on 22 May. Police also received a confirmed sighting of her at 5.40pm on Cambusnethan Street, walking towards the Cambusnethan area.

D/Supt Robertson explained that the police were using new media for the first time in a murder investigation as they believed that many of those who knew Nelson were teenaged or younger and may not have wanted their parents to know where they were at the time or what they were doing. He reassured potential witnesses that: [...] "If there <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> underage drinking, I don't care. If there are people where they shouldn't be, I don't care.

Abbasi said, [...] "professionals who study and treat phobias tend not to use all the Latin and Greek names that get tossed around on message boards and in the press." [...] However, on blogs and in internet forums, thousands of people claim to have trypophobia. Psychiatrist Carol Mathews said, [...] "There might really <b>be</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> with phobias to holes, because people can really have a phobia to anything, but just reading what's on the Internet, that doesn't seem to <b>be</b> what <b>people</b> actually have."

There <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who contribute the stories, create the world, and there's always the possibility that you can become one of them. In my case, because I came to Trek from the Blish novelizations, and was acutely conscious of how the written versions compared to the actual episodes, the idea of writing not screenplays but novels was very appealing. Plus, of course, I'm a better novelist than I am a screenwriter!" ...|$|E
