5|$|The dish is {{typically}} prepared by rolling shucked oysters in bacon and baking them in <b>an</b> <b>oven.</b> Modern variations of angels on horseback include skewering and frying. Serving can vary widely to taste on either skewers or breads, with additional accompaniments or condiments. Angels on horseback {{differ from the}} similar, fruit-based, devils on horseback, but the dishes' names are sometimes erroneously considered synonyms.|$|E
5|$|Gom bian (also {{known as}} 光饼 or Kompia) — a Foochow {{delicacy}} made with flour, baked in <b>an</b> <b>oven</b> and eaten either {{with or without}} meat and gravy. It is somewhat similar to a bagel. However, it can be either in a crisp or soft version. Traditional soft kompia dipped in pork sauce can be sought from Chung Hua road and the Sunday Market at Pedada road. There are deep fried variations available throughout the town of Sibu.|$|E

5000|$|The various {{standard}} phrases {{to describe}} oven temperatures include {{words such as}} [...] "cool" [...] to [...] "hot" [...] or [...] "very slow" [...] to [...] "fast". For example, <b>a</b> cool <b>oven</b> has temperature set to 90°C (200°F), and <b>a</b> slow <b>oven</b> has <b>a</b> temperature range from 150-160°C (300-325°F). <b>A</b> moderate <b>oven</b> has <b>a</b> range of 180-190°C (350-375°F), and <b>a</b> hot <b>oven</b> has temperature set to 200-230°C (400-450°F). <b>A</b> fast <b>oven</b> has <b>a</b> range of 230-260°C (450-500°F) for the typical temperature.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> halogen <b>oven,</b> halogen {{convection}} oven, or halogen cooking pot is <b>a</b> type of <b>oven</b> that utilizes <b>a</b> {{halogen lamp}} as its heating element. It is used primarily for cooking. Halogen ovens are often noted for being more energy-efficient than <b>a</b> conventional <b>oven</b> {{due to their}} use of a halogen lamp reducing the cooking time usually needed in <b>a</b> conventional <b>oven.</b>|$|R
5|$|Things {{escalate}} {{quickly and}} the police arrive, responding to a noise complaint. The partygoers remain silent, convincing the officers that the party has already ended. The police leave and the party resumes. T-Rick's gnome is smashed, revealing that it contains {{a large amount of}} ecstasy tablets, which are quickly consumed by the partygoers. Thomas kisses Kirby and reveals that he loves her. Alexis meanwhile flirts with Thomas throughout the night and eventually seduces him. Kirby walks in on the pair as they are about to have sex and leaves the party upset. The noise and chaos of the party, which has now spilled into the surrounding neighborhood, receives televised news coverage with helicopters flying over the house.

5|$|When {{the time}} came {{for the company to}} develop a new broiler, it turned to its {{equipment}} manufacturer, Nieco, and St. Louis, Missouri-based Duke Manufacturing. Burger King's goal was to maintain the company's trademark flame broiling method while allowing more product options on a flexible cooking platform. The solutions that Nieco and Duke devised met that goal by using control features during cooking. The cooking methods employed by the two manufacturing companies vary in their methods; Nieco employed two chains, one that maintained a single speed and cooking temperature, and another that had a flexible speed setting and variable temperature control. Duke's solution utilizes <b>an</b> <b>oven</b> that cooks according to preset parameters for time and temperature, one heterogeneous product batch at a time. The first batch-style broiler was introduced in April 1999 and was tested in-store in central Wisconsin during the summer of 1999.|$|E
5|$|All {{types of}} cooking {{involved}} the direct use of fire. Kitchen stoves {{did not appear}} until the 18th century, and cooks had {{to know how to}} cook directly over an open fire. Ovens were used, but they were expensive to construct and only existed in fairly large households and bakeries. It was common for a community to have shared ownership of <b>an</b> <b>oven</b> to ensure that the bread baking essential to everyone was made communal rather than private. There were also portable ovens designed to be filled with food and then buried in hot coals, and even larger ones on wheels that were used to sell pies in the streets of medieval towns. But for most people, almost all cooking was done in simple stewpots, since this was the most efficient use of firewood and did not waste precious cooking juices, making potages and stews the most common dishes. Overall, most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a fairly high fat content, or at least when fat could be afforded. This was considered less of a problem in a time of back-breaking toil, famine, and a greater acceptance—even desirability—of plumpness; only the poor or sick, and devout ascetics, were thin.|$|E

5|$|No major {{alterations}} {{have been}} made since the Reformation in the 1530s and 1540s, {{but there have been}} many changes to the interior to accommodate various phases of Church of England worship. Among these are <b>an</b> <b>oven</b> used for baking communion bread in the south east corner of the north chapel. During the Civil War, considerable damage was done including the destruction of nearly all of the medieval stained glass. William III of England worshipped in the church following his landing in the Glorious Revolution of 1689. By the early 19th century, all the medieval furnishings, except the Norman font had disappeared. New pews were made and the west galleries were added in 1808-11. The latest restoration that has left the church interior visible today, took place in the late 19th century; it was more sympathetic to the church's architectural character than many Victorian restorations. At this time, the central section of the west gallery was removed to reveal the great west window and the organ was relocated to the south transept. The pews date from around 1900 and have attractive carved bench-ends. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{some other}} red dyes {{obtained}} from scale insects, the red coloring is derived from carminic acid with traces of kermesic acid. The Polish cochineal carminic acid content is approximately 0.6% of the insect's dried body weight. The insects were harvested shortly before the female larvae reached maturity, i.e. in late June, usually around Saint John the Baptist's day (June 24), hence the dye's folk name, Saint John's blood. The harvesting process involved uprooting the host plant and picking the female larvae, averaging approximately ten insects from each plant. In Poland, including present-day Ukraine, and elsewhere in Europe, plantations were operated {{in order to deal}} with the high toll on the host plants. The larvae were killed with boiling water or vinegar and dried in the sun or in <b>an</b> <b>oven,</b> ground, and dissolved in sourdough or in light rye beer called kvass in order to remove fat. The extract could then be used for dyeing silk, wool, cotton, or linen. The dyeing process requires roughly 3-4oz of dye per pound (180-250g per kilogram) of silk and one pound of dye to color almost 20pounds (50g per kilogram) of wool.|$|E

25|$|Formerly {{found only}} in large {{industrial}} applications, microwave <b>ovens</b> increasingly became <b>a</b> standard fixture of residential kitchens in developed countries. By 1986, roughly 25% of households in the U.S. owned <b>a</b> microwave <b>oven,</b> up from only about 1% in 1971; the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that over 90% of American households owned <b>a</b> microwave <b>oven</b> in 1997. In Australia, a 2008 market research study found that 95% of kitchens contained <b>a</b> microwave <b>oven</b> and that 83% of them were used daily. In Canada, fewer than 5% of households had <b>a</b> microwave <b>oven</b> in 1979, but more than 88% of households owned one by 1998. In France, 40% of households owned <b>a</b> microwave <b>oven</b> in 1994, but that number had increased to 65% by 2004.|$|R

25|$|Whole Peking Ducks can {{be ordered}} as takeaways. The ducks can be reheated at home with <b>an</b> <b>oven,</b> grill or boiling oil. When <b>an</b> <b>oven</b> is used, the duck is heated at a {{temperature}} of 150°C (300°F) for 20 minutes, and then at 160°C (325°F) for another 10 minutes. The grilling method involves filling the duck with boiling water before placing it on a griddle, 70cm (28in) above the cooking fire. The boiling water is replaced every 3–4 minutes until the duck's skin is piping hot. To reheat the Peking Duck with oil, the duck is sliced into thin pieces {{and placed in a}} strainer held over a wok of boiling oil. The duck is then rinsed several times with the oil.|$|E
