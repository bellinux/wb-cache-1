60|$|When men {{of science}} (or, more often, men {{who talk about}} science) speak of {{studying}} history or human society scientifically they always forget that there <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>quite</b> distinct questions involved. It may be that certain facts of the body go with certain facts of the soul, but it by no means follows that a grasp of such facts of the body goes with a grasp of the things of the soul. A man may show very learnedly that certain mixtures of race make a happy community, but he may be quite wrong (he generally is) about what communities are happy. A man may explain scientifically how a certain physical type involves a really bad man, but he may be quite wrong (he generally is) about which sort of man is really bad. Thus his whole argument is useless, for he understands only {{one half of the}} equation.|$|E

60|$|Taking {{the word}} 'idea' in Berkeley's sense, there <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>quite</b> {{distinct}} {{things to be}} considered whenever an idea is before the mind. There is {{on the one hand}} the thing of which we are aware--say the colour of my table--and on the other hand the actual awareness itself, the mental act of apprehending the thing. The mental act is undoubtedly mental, but {{is there any reason to}} suppose that the thing apprehended is in any sense mental? Our previous arguments concerning the colour did not prove it to be mental; they only proved that its existence depends upon the relation of our sense organs to the physical object--in our case, the table. That is to say, they proved that a certain colour will exist, in a certain light, if a normal eye is placed at a certain point relatively to the table. They did not prove that the colour is in the mind of the percipient.|$|E
6000|$|It {{has long}} been {{generally}} recognised that there <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>quite</b> divergent ways of attacking sociological and economic questions, one that is called scientific {{and one that is}} not, and I claim no particular virtue in the recognition of that; but I do claim a certain freshness in my analysis of this difference, and it is to that analysis that your attention is now called. When I claim freshness I do not make, you understand, any claim to original discovery. What I have to say, and have been saying for some time, is also more or less, and with certain differences {{to be found in the}} thought of Professor Bosanquet, for example, in Alfred Sidgwick's [...] "Use of Words in Reasoning," [...] in Sigwart's [...] "Logic," [...] in contemporary American metaphysical speculation. I am only one incidental voice speaking in a general movement of thought. My trend of thought leads me to deny that sociology is a science, or only a science in the same loose sense that modern history is a science, and to throw doubt upon the value of sociology that follows too closely what is called the scientific method.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{makes two}} arguments; first, that {{progressive}} parties cannot {{afford to be}} neutral {{about the role of}} organised labour and second, that a determined effort must be made to improve workplace employment relations, by encouraging effective employer-union co-operation. It may have struck you already that these seem to <b>be</b> <b>two</b> <b>quite</b> distinct arguments. You might even find it difficult to relate one to the other. But the case made in this paper is that the political role of organised labour is legitimised by the fact that trade unions have credibility in the workplace.  ...|$|R

In the Middle Ages there <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>quite</b> different uses for firewood from the forests - local and non-local. Locally there was only one requirement that had an unrestricted priority: the use of firewood for home fires. In addition, a range of industry processes required firewood as an energy source or as a raw material, for example: charcoal burning, glassmaking, salt production and mining with its associated hammer mills.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{sophisticated}} wares in authentic Japanese styles {{were being}} made at Arita for the fastidious home market, European-style designations of Arita porcelain were formed after blue and white kraak porcelains, imitating Chinese underglaze [...] "blue-and-white" [...] wares, or made use of enamel colors over underglazes of cobalt blue and iron red. The ware often used copious gilding, sometimes with spare isolated sprigged vignettes, but often densely patterned in compartments. There <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>quite</b> different styles in these wares. Globular Imari teapots with swan-necked spouts helped establish the classic European form for these new necessities of life.|$|R

50|$|There <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>quite</b> {{separate}} possible origins for the surname MacLaren. One {{of these}} {{comes from the}} county of Perthshire while the other comes from the island of Tiree in Argyll. In Argyll the MacLaren family {{is said to be}} descended from Fergus MacErc, founder of the kingdom of Dál Riata. In Scottish Gaelic the clan name is Clann Labhruinn. However the ancestor of the MacLarens is generally given as Laurence, Abbot of Achtow in Balquhidder, who lived during the thirteenth century. Balquhidder was part of the ancient princedom of Strathern whose heraldry is shown in the heraldry of the MacLarens. The heraldry borne by the clan suggests that they descend from a cadet branch of the dynasty of the Earls of Strathearn.|$|E

5000|$|The French colonial state, as he {{conceived}} it {{and as it}} {{took shape}} in Algeria, was a two-tiered organization, quite unlike the regime in mainland France. It introduced two different political and legal systems which, in the last analysis, were based on racial, cultural and religious distinctions. According to De Tocqueville, the system that should apply to the colonizers would enable them alone to hold property and travel freely, but would deprive them of any form of political freedom, which should be suspended in Algeria. “There should therefore <b>be</b> <b>two</b> <b>quite</b> distinct legislations in Africa, for there <b>are</b> <b>two</b> very separate communities.

It is the latter sort of gauge transformation that enters into the BRST method. Unlike a passive transformation, it is well-defined globally on a principal bundle with any structure group over an arbitrary manifold. (However, for concreteness and relevance to conventional QFT, this article will stick to the case of a principal gauge bundle with compact fiber over 4-dimensional Minkowski space.) ...|$|E
