After the sentence had been carried out a county coroner would visit Halifax and convene a jury of 12men, sometimes the same individuals who had found the felon guilty, and ask them to give an account under oath of the circumstances of the conviction and execution, for the official records.|$|E
5|$|Nathan Johnson {{was charged}} with simple {{possession}} of methamphetamine and possession of a firearm by <b>a</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>felon,</b> and received a $10,000 bond at a bond hearing. Some media outlets said the low bond amount indicated authorities did not believe {{he was capable of}} assassinating Obama. On December 16, 2008, Johnson pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a weapon by a prohibited person. Johnson was released from the Englewood Federal Correctional Institution on March 4, 2010.|$|E
5|$|It {{was unclear}} how Hsu could have {{remained}} at large for 15 years {{and engage in}} prominent political activity without being detected. It was also unclear how <b>a</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>felon,</b> having already fled prosecution once, was allowed out on bail without first having to surrender his passport. Prior to Hsu's second attempt to flee, James Brosnahan, Hsu's attorney in California, defended Hsu stating that Hsu's prominence showed {{that he did not}} behave like a fugitive and that Hsu was moving towards a resolution of the matter, including a plan of restitution for victims of Hsu's actions.|$|E

5|$|Dominic Purcell as Lincoln Burrows: Lincoln is a {{high school}} {{drop-out}} and <b>a</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>felon,</b> who is wrongfully accused of and charged {{with the murder of}} Terence Steadman, the brother of the Vice President of the United States. Purcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently, he was the last actor to join the original cast. He auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as Tommy Ravetto on North Shore. Since working on John Doe, Purcell has had an amiable relationship with Fox. Hence, he was sent the pilot script of Prison Break. Scheuring's first impression of Purcell did not convince him as a fit for the role since the actor went to the audition with his hair styled and a tan. However, Purcell's acting won the role. He arrived on the set {{on the first day of}} filming with a shaved head, which amazed Scheuring with the physical likeness of the series' two leading actors.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Gregory Banks, <b>a</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>felon,</b> filed a {{civil suit}} for $16 million in damages against Burge, three colleagues, and the City of Chicago for condoning {{brutality}} and torture. He {{said that he had}} falsely confessed in 1983 to murder after he was tortured by officers: they placed a plastic bag over his head, put a gun in his mouth, and performed other acts. He said that the officers allegedly abused eleven other suspects, using such measures as electro-shock. The suit was brought by the People's Law Office attorneys who had represented Andrew Wilson in the 1989 police brutality case. The suit described 23 incidents against black and Hispanic suspects between 19721985. The Bank's suit named Sergeant Peter Dignan as one of the officers involved in the abuses. In 1995 Dignan was promoted for meritorious service, even though the City of Chicago had settled out of court with Banks on his suit.|$|E
5|$|In March 1933, {{less than}} three months after the Nazis seized power, Himmler set up the first {{official}} concentration camp at Dachau. Hitler had stated {{that he did not want}} it to be just another prison or detention camp. Himmler appointed Theodor Eicke, <b>a</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>felon</b> and ardent Nazi, to run the camp in June 1933. Eicke devised a system that was used as a model for future camps throughout Germany. Its features included isolation of victims from the outside world, elaborate roll calls and work details, the use of force and executions to exact obedience, and a strict disciplinary code for the guards. Uniforms were issued for prisoners and guards alike; the guards' uniforms had a special Totenkopf (death's head) insignia on their collars. By the end of 1934, Himmler took control of the camps under the aegis of the SS, creating a separate division, the SS-Totenkopfverbände.|$|E

25|$|On September 1, T.I. and {{his wife}} Tiny were arrested for drug charges.

25|$|Khodorkovsky also {{planned to}} {{participate}} in the Duma byelections for the same seat as Kvachkov.

Unexpectedly it took only a couple of weeks to process Khodorkovsky's appeal, invalidating any of his electoral plans until the end of his sentence.|$|E

Therefore, the seat was awarded to his Conservative opponent.|$|E

The month the two were married Biryukova reported him to the police in Redmond for allegedly assaulting her and got a no-contact order; she nevertheless visited him regularly in jail in Issaquah, where he was when she gave birth, under assumed names. Both claimed to investigators they did not live together despite giving them the same address; Biryukova {{said at one point}} she did not even know who the father was even though his name was on the child's birth certificate.|$|E
25|$|Partial DNA matches are not {{searches}} themselves, but are {{the result}} of moderate stringency CODIS searches that produce a potential match that shares at least one allele at every locus. Partial matching does not involve the use of familial search software, such as those used in the UK and United States, or additional Y-STR analysis, and therefore often misses sibling relationships. Partial matching has been used to identify suspects in several cases in the UK and United States, and has also been used as a tool to exonerate the falsely accused. Darryl Hunt was wrongly convicted in connection with the rape and murder of a young woman in 1984 in North Carolina. Hunt was exonerated in 2004 when a DNA database search produced a remarkably close match between <b>a</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>felon</b> and the forensic profile from the case. The partial match led investigators to the felon’s brother, Willard E. Brown, who confessed to the crime when confronted by police. A judge then signed an order to dismiss the case against Hunt.|$|E
5|$|Police {{departments}} throughout Oregon {{decline to}} press charges, or {{charges have been}} dropped for possessing and growing marijuana, even for convicted drug dealers.
