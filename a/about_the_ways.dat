5|$|The {{challenges}} and quests {{were developed to}} keep players occupied while playing through the story. Molyeux told Leach <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> {{of good and evil}} and the system's reflection of the player's behaviour, and provided him with a digital copy of the Bible with instructions to study the concepts due to their connection with gods and men. Leach decided to supplement the idea of evil with mischief, as he thought being completely evil by annoying or killing followers was senseless. Molyneux wanted a conflict between good and evil, and for the enemy gods to have the opposite alignment to the player. As a method of introducing the player to miracles and combat, a god whose alignment {{is the same as the}} player's was added.|$|E
5|$|While {{living in}} exile in Switzerland, after being forced to flee Nazi-occupied Austria, Salten wrote a sequel to Bambi that follows the birth and lives of Bambi's twin offspring, Geno and Gurri. The young fawns {{interact}} with various deer, and are educated and watched over by Bambi and Faline as they grow. They also learn more <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> of man, including both hunters and the gamekeeper seeking to protect the deer. Due to Salten's exiled status — {{he had lost his}} Austrian publisher Paul Zsolnay Verlag — the English translation of the novel was published first, in the United States in 1939 by Bobbs-Merrill, but it would take a year before the sequel was published in the original German language in Switzerland by his new publisher.|$|E

50|$|As a witch, Tiffany {{possesses}} First Sight, {{the ability}} to see 'what is really there' (as opposed to second sight, which shows people what they think ought to be there). She also possesses Second Thoughts, which are defined as 'the thoughts you think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> you think'. Whilst other witches are said to have this trait as well, Tiffany also recognizes some of her thoughts as Third Thoughts (the thoughts you think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> you think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> you think), and Fourth Thoughts (the thoughts you think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> you think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> you think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> you think). All these thoughts sometimes cause Tiffany to walk into door frames.|$|R

25|$|In {{determining}} {{premiums and}} premium rate structures, insurers consider quantifiable factors, including location, credit scores, gender, occupation, marital status, and education level. However, {{the use of}} such factors is often considered to be unfair or unlawfully discriminatory, and the reaction against this practice has in some instances led to political disputes <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which insurers determine premiums and regulatory intervention to limit the factors used.|$|E
25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} is very vague <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> {{to determine when}} splitting happens, and nowadays usually the criterion {{is that the two}} branches have decohered. However, present day understanding of decoherence does not allow a completely precise, self-contained way to say when the two branches have decohered/"do not interact", and hence many-worlds interpretation remains arbitrary. This objection is saying that {{it is not clear what}} is precisely meant by branching, and point to the lack of self-contained criteria specifying branching.|$|E

25|$|Language {{learning}} {{takes place}} in different contexts, with both the infant and the caregiver engaging in social interactions. Recent research have investigated how infants and adults use cross-situational statistics {{in order to learn}} about not only the meanings of words but also the constraints within a context. For example, Smith and his colleagues proposed that infants learn language by acquiring a bias to label objects to similar objects that come from categories that are well-defined. Important to this view is the idea that the constraints that assist learning of words are not independent of the input itself or the infant's experience. Rather, constraints come about as infants learn <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> that the words are used and begin to pay attention to certain characteristics of objects that have been used in the past to represent the words.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{testified that}} he then endured five days of {{derogatory}} comments about himself, his beliefs, his girlfriend and his pastor, and diatribes by Ross <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which Christianity and conservative Protestantism were wrong. He was intimidated, forced to watch videos on cults and told his church was just the same. He said he was watched 24 hours a day. On every visit to the bathroom, he was accompanied by at least two men. Every day, Ross argued with Scott about matters of religion, without giving {{him a chance to}} say anything in return, often tapping him or hitting him on the head to underscore his points while Scott was being restrained or closely watched. Scott was told that he would only regain his liberty once the deprogramming had been concluded successfully and he had given up his beliefs.|$|E
25|$|The series explores social problems, {{including}} discrimination, scientific advancement, political greed, brotherhood, family, and war. Scar's backstory and his {{hatred of}} the state military references the Ainu people, who had their land taken by other people. This includes the consequences of guerrilla warfare {{and the amount of}} violent soldiers a military can have. Some of the people who took the Ainus' land were originally Ainu; this irony is referenced in Scar's use of alchemy to kill alchemists even though it was forbidden in his own religion. The Elrics being orphans and adopted by Pinako Rockbell reflects Arakawa's beliefs <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> society should treat orphans. The characters' dedication to their occupations reference the need to work for food. The series also explores the concept of equivalent exchange; to obtain something new, one must pay with something of equal value. This is applied by alchemists when creating new materials and is also a philosophical belief the Elric brothers follow.|$|E

500|$|Starting {{early in}} January, 1891, Carrie Chapman Catt visited Stone {{repeatedly}} at Pope's Hill, {{for the purpose}} of learning from Stone <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> of political organizing. Stone had previously met Catt at an Iowa state woman's suffrage convention in October, 1889, and had been impressed at her ambition and sense of presence, saying [...] "Mrs. Chapman will be heard from yet in this movement." [...] Stone mentored Catt the rest of that winter, giving her a wealth of information about lobbying techniques and fund-raising. Catt later used the teaching to good effect in leading the final drive to gain women the vote in 1920.|$|E

[...] Some feminists, such as Ruth Hubbard and Evelyn Fox Keller, criticize traditional scientific discourse as being historically biased towards a male perspective. A part of the feminist research agenda is {{the examination of the}} ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in scientific and academic institutions. Physicist Lisa Randall, appointed to a task force at Harvard by then-president Lawrence Summers after his controversial discussion of why women may be underrepresented in science and engineering, said, [...] "I just want to see a whole bunch more women enter the field so these issues don't have to come up anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|The rest of {{the book}} {{consists}} {{of a series of}} anecdotes <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> that Baxter supported and accepted her daughter and continued to win her love and respect, through unwed motherhood, a failed marriage, and career ups and downs. [...] Angelou relates several stories of Baxter, including her support of Angelou as an independent single mother, her life-saving intervention after a jealous ex-boyfriend beat Angelou, and her initial resistance and then acceptance of Angelou's first marriage to Greek sailor Tosh Angelos. [...] Angelou recounts the beginning of her career as a dancer and entertainer in San Francisco; Baxter cared for her grandson as Angelou traveled Europe {{as a member of the}} Gershwin opera Porgy and Bess. [...] Angelou felt so guilty about leaving her son that she returned and resumed her relationship with her mother and son, eventually moving to New York City and starting a new career as a writer and poet.|$|E
500|$|According to the Wachowskis, {{the origins}} of Sense8 date back several years before the {{announcement}} of the show to [...] "a late-night conversation <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> technology simultaneously unites and divides us". Straczynski recalls that when the Wachowskis decided to create their first series, because of Straczynski's extensive experience working with the format, Lana chose to invite him to her house in San Francisco to brainstorm ideas together. Both the Wachowskis and Straczynski agreed that if they were to do a television series, they wanted to attempt something that [...] "nobody had done before", and change the [...] "vocabulary for television production" [...] the same way The Matrix became a major influence for action movies. After several days of discussion they decided on creating a show that would explore the relationship between empathy and evolution in the human race, and whose story would be told in a global scale, necessitating filming on location in several countries over the world, in contrast to the standard production model for television which attempts to limit or fake that as much as possible. A source of inspiration for Straczynski was his own experience concerning friends of his who live {{in different parts of the}} world but coordinate to watch a movie at the same time and comment to each other online about it.|$|E
