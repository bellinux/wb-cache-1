5|$|In 1999, while {{a sophomore}} <b>at</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> State University, Parker and his roommate and wrestling teammate, Jean McGianni Celestin, {{were accused of}} raping a fellow student. The unnamed accuser stated that Parker and Celestin raped her while she was {{intoxicated}} and unconscious, {{and that she was}} unsure of how many people had been involved. The woman later went to a doctor, who concluded that she had been sexually assaulted, and local authorities taped a phone conversation between her and Parker in which Parker confirmed that it was he and Celestin who had sex with her. She also stated that the two harassed her after she pressed charges, and that they hired a private investigator who showed her picture around campus, revealing her identity.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Colony Collapse Disorder Working Group, based {{primarily}} <b>at</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> State University, was established. Their preliminary report pointed out some patterns, but drew no strong conclusions. A survey of beekeepers early in 2007 indicated most hobbyist beekeepers believed that starvation {{was the leading}} cause of death in their colonies, while commercial beekeepers overwhelmingly believed invertebrate pests (Varroa mites, honey bee tracheal mites, and/or small hive beetles) were {{the leading cause of}} colony mortality. A scholarly review in June 2007 similarly addressed numerous theories and possible contributing factor, but left the issue unresolved.|$|E

5|$|It was <b>at</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> in 1901 that Pound met Hilda Doolittle (later {{known as}} the poet H.D.), his first serious romance, {{according}} to Pound scholar Ira Nadel. In 1911 she followed Pound to London and became involved in developing the Imagism movement. Between 1905 and 1907 Pound wrote several poems for her, 25 of which he hand-bound and called Hilda's Book, and in 1908 he asked her father, the astronomy professor Charles Doolittle, for permission to marry her, but Doolittle dismissed Pound as a nomad. Pound was seeing two other women at the same time—Viola Baxter and Mary Moore—later dedicating a book of poetry, Personae (1909), to the latter. He asked Moore to marry him too, but she turned him down.|$|E

5|$|Taking up his {{part-time}} professorship at the Institute of Archaeology, {{he began}} to lecture to students almost every day. There, he found that he developed a relationship of mutual respect with the director, Childe, despite their strong personal and professional differences. In April 1949, after the retirement of Cyril Fox, Wheeler was nominated for the Presidency of the Society of Antiquaries, but lost to James Mann; many archaeologists, including Childe and O. G. S. Crawford, resigned from the Society in protest, deeming Wheeler {{to have been a}} far more appropriate candidate for the position. Wheeler was nevertheless elected director of the Society. In 1950 he was awarded the Petrie Medal, and in 1952 was knighted. That same year he was invited to give the Norton lectures for the Archaeological Institute of America, and while in the United States was also awarded the Lucy Wharton Drexel medal <b>at</b> <b>Pennsylvania.</b> He nevertheless disliked the country, and in later life exhibited anti-Americanism.|$|E

5|$|M-85 {{starts a}} {{directional}} interchange with I-75 in near Rockwood; traffic {{to or from}} southbound I-75 must use Gibraltar Road instead. M-85 runs north from this interchange to Gibraltar Road as a full freeway; north of that intersection the highway becomes a boulevard. There are many businesses directly adjacent to Fort Street in the Downriver area with residential subdivisions {{on either side of}} them. The trunkline parallels lines of the Norfolk Southern and Canadian National railways. In this area, M-85 is also running parallel to, but inland from, {{the southern part of the}} Detroit River. The highway runs northeasterly through Gibraltar to Trenton, where it turns due north. Fort Street forms the boundary between Riverview and Trenton in the area near the Riverview Landing Shopping Center between King and Silbey Roads; north of here, Riverview extends along both sides of the road. <b>At</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> Road, Fort Street crosses into the city of Southgate and curves to the northeast near the Southgate Tower office building. The highway returns to a due northerly course near Memorial Park and continues along the Southgate–Wyandotte city line.
