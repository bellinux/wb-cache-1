40|$|ABSTRACT. Objective. To {{review the}} extent to which the {{literature}} supports the position that <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> home is important and to review {{the extent to}} which insurance is related to having <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> home. Methods. <b>A</b> review of literature concerning the bene-fits of <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> home on effectiveness, costs, and equity (reducing disparities) was conducted. Results. International and within-nation studies indi-cate that a relationship with <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> home is associated with better health, on both the individual and population levels, with lower overall costs of care and with reduc-tions in disparities in health between socially disadvan-taged subpopulations and more socially advantaged pop-ulations.

40|$|In this paper, Author {{presents}} basic definitions {{found in}} the Polish literature concerning medical error and medical event. Author proposes her own definitions for the terms. The concept of <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> event was first used in the recent Act of 28 April 2011 amending the act on the patient's rights and Patient's Ombudsman, and the act on obligatory insurance, Guarantee Fund and the Polish Motor Insurers' Bureau, while the notion of <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> error {{has been used for}} long. Thus, Author examines differences between the two terms. Based on analysis, Author concludes that the occurrence of <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> event does not require us to demonstrate who has contributed its occurrence, while such demonstration is required in the case of <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> error. The two terms are associated with different scopes of liability for the occurred medical event or error, that is, <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> event is limited to therapeutic activities activity of hospitals while liability for <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> error may be attributed to all medicinal entities...|$|R
