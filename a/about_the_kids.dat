500|$|Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode a 4.6 out of 5 stars, {{and went on}} to {{describe}} the episode as [...] "A funny, touching, entertaining Glee episode that didn't feature a single line from Sue Sylvester? I never thought I'd see the day. But that's exactly what transpired on 'Silly Love Songs', as the show stopped feeling like a Public Service Announcement for a week and actually focused on well-paced, well-written relationship developments among its core characters." [...] Joel Keller of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, and wrote, Silly Love Songs' strikes an interesting contrast to Sunday night's post-Super Bowl episode in that tonight was more <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> and where they are in their stories than about big production numbers and Sue's cartoon evilness. It was also the funniest episode of the season, in no small part because we got some insight into the lives of two New Directions members we rarely get to hang out with for any length of time: Santana and Lauren." [...] James Poniewozik of Time Magazine praised the storyline and the musical performances of the episode. However, Soraya Roberts of the Daily News gave the episode a negative review: [...] "This show sometimes sounds like it was written by a PIT, prime idiot TV writer. It's almost as bad as Tina breaking down into tears for no reason while singing 'My Funny Valentine' to Mike and Blaine attempting to channel Frank Sinatra while singing Paul McCartney's 'Silly Love Songs' in the middle of Breadsticks." [...] Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post praised the storyline, calling it cohesive.|$|E

2500|$|A second {{development}} for the show was the relationship between Lionel and Martha Kent. As part of season two was about expanding {{the lives of the}} adults away from Clark, [...] "Nocturne" [...] saw the beginning of the Lionel/Martha relationship. This relationship allowed for more situations of Schneider and O'Toole doing scenes together that were not <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids.</b> By the end of the season, each of the main characters reach turning points in their lives. Welling also commented on his character’s development {{over the course of the}} season, specifically on Clark meeting his biological father and how that affects his life: [...] "To have two very strong father figures telling you different things is a lot to handle, and Clark has to take this information, put it to the test and come to his own conclusion, and it’s not an easy one." ...|$|E

Because Rucks never learns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid's</b> actions explicitly, <b>the</b> narration is mostly anecdotal and primarily serves to fill in background information about each level; however, it also serves to keep the fourth wall intact, as player deaths are portrayed as jokes on the narrator's part. After the player's actions catch up to the story, the narration switches to a more speculative tone, as Rucks no longer knows what the player is doing.|$|R
