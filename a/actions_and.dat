40|$|In this {{introduction}} to the special issue on <b>Action</b> <b>and</b> perception in infancy, we summarize recent arguments of Milner and Goodale for a dissociation between vision for <b>action</b> <b>and</b> vision for perception in adults. We propose that this dissociation is probably present from birth, and further that vision for <b>action</b> <b>and</b> vision for perception follow different developmental trajectories. Based on this framework, we discern four themes of interest for infancy research (i. e., information <b>and</b> <b>action,</b> exploration <b>and</b> <b>action,</b> information <b>and</b> perception, and the interaction between <b>action</b> <b>and</b> perception) and introduce {{the contributions of the}} special issue accordingly...|$|R
