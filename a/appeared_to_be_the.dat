5|$|After JNA {{captured}} Vukovar on 18 November, the JNA 12th (Novi Sad) Corps, {{supported by}} the Serbian Ministry of Interior-trained Serb Volunteer Guard paramilitaries, started to advance west between Vinkovci and Osijek on 20 November. The city of Osijek <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> next target of the JNA, which was later confirmed by General Života Panić, commander of the JNA 1st Military District.|$|E
5|$|Bill Fulcher supplanted Bud Carson. Fulcher <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> {{right choice}} but quit after two seasons, {{overwhelmed}} by the Tech fan base. Fulcher's tenure included a terrible feud with Eddie McAshan, which peaked before the 1972 UGA game. McAshan had requested additional tickets for the game so that his family could attend. Fulcher refused the ticket request and McAshan sat out of practice in protest. Fulcher responded by suspending the quarterback for the UGA game and the upcoming Liberty Bowl. The story exploded {{on the national scene}} when Jesse Jackson attended the UGA game, allowing McAshan to sit with him outside of the stadium in protest.|$|E
5|$|FBI agents arrested Kaczynski on April 3, 1996, at his cabin, {{where he}} was found in an unkempt state. A search of his cabin {{revealed}} a cache of bomb components, 40,000 hand-written journal pages that included bomb-making experiments, descriptions of the Unabomber crimes and one live bomb, ready for mailing. They also found what <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> original typed manuscript of Industrial Society and Its Future. By this point, the Unabomber had {{been the target of}} the most expensive investigation in FBI history.|$|E

5|$|The nearby city of Heidelberg, {{further south}} of the Main on the Neckar River, <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> next French target. Lieutenant Field Marshal Peter Quasdanovich, who had {{remained}} in the region between Mannheim and Heidelberg, used a hastily enhanced abatis to establish a defensive line at the sleepy country village of Handschuhsheim, east {{of the city of}} Heidelberg. The French force of two divisions—about 12,000 men—outnumbered the 8,000 defenders, and the position seemed untenable.|$|E
5|$|Three men {{sought the}} Democratic {{nomination}} for governor at the 1899 party convention in LouisvilleGoebel, Wat Hardin, and William J. Stone. When Hardin <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> front-runner for the nomination, Stone and Goebel {{agreed to work}} together against him. Stone's supporters would back whomever Goebel picked to preside over the convention. In exchange, half the delegates from Louisville, who were pledged to Goebel, would vote to nominate Stone for governor. Goebel would then {{drop out of the}} race, but would name many of the other officials on the ticket. As word of the plan spread, Hardin dropped out of the race, believing he would be beaten by the Stone–Goebel alliance.|$|E
5|$|Beetle remains bearing what <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> {{marks of}} bird attacks {{have been found}} by the River Ouse and {{hardened}} adults often bear symmetrically indented elytra, interpreted as 'pinch marks' inflicted by a beak whilst newly emerged adults are still hardening. Dead beetles have also {{been found in the}} webs of spiders in a captive population. The accidental predation of C. graminis by livestock consuming the tansy plant is also possible. Predation of a larva by the scorpionfly Panorpa germanica has been observed in the field. The tachinid genus Macquartia exclusively parasitizes Chrysolmelid beetles and one species of which, Macquartia dispar, may parasitise C. graminis directly. The adult fly deposits fully incubated eggs or newly hatched larvae into the vicinity of the host larvae.|$|E

5|$|Media {{attention}} was also {{directed at the}} teams' offensive capabilities. Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year in the week {{leading up to the}} game. In {{the first half of the}} 2007 season, Ryan had been prominently mentioned in candidate lists for the Heisman Trophy, college football's highest individual award. Although Ryan's late-game comeback in their previous game against Virginia Tech had made him a front-runner, the team's two subsequent losses to unranked teams dropped him from contention for the Heisman. Excellent performances in a division-clinching win at Clemson and against Miami seemed to return Ryan to Heisman-candidate form, however, and heading into the ACC Championship Game, Ryan <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> biggest offensive threat for Boston College.|$|E
5|$|One day at harvest time, {{according}} to William of Newburgh {{during the reign}} of King Stephen (1135–1154), the villagers of Woolpit discovered two children, a brother and sister, beside one of the wolf pits that gave the village its name. Their skin was green, they spoke an unknown language, and their clothing was unfamiliar. Ralph reports that the children were taken to the home of Richard de Calne. Ralph and William agree that the pair refused all food for several days until they came across some raw broad beans, which they consumed eagerly. The children gradually adapted to normal food and in time lost their green colour. The boy, who <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> younger of the two, became sickly and died shortly after he and his sister were baptised.|$|E
5|$|The paper {{used for}} the Grolier Codex appears to be {{authentic}} pre-Columbian bark paper dating from the 13th century. A number of non-destructive techniques have been applied to the codex {{in an effort to}} authenticate it, and the results were published in 2008. The analysis revealed that only pre-Columbian materials had been used in its creation; no modern inorganic materials were detected. Some inconsistencies were revealed however; cuts along the page edges seem to have been made with a sharp blade in order to give the appearance of natural wear and tear and the supposed water staining did not permeate the paper. The researchers commented that the staining <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> result of drops of dye or ink being applied {{to the surface of the}} codex. In conclusion the researchers were unable to support or refute the pre-Columbian nature of the codex. Unusually for a document that supposedly was stored in a cave for centuries, the paint of the codex still appears fresh.|$|E

5|$|The {{precipitate}} {{action of}} the Hospitallers could have caused Richard's whole strategy to unravel. However, he recognised that the counterattack, once started, had to be supported by all his army and ordered the signal for a general charge to be sounded. Unsupported, the Hospitallers and the other rear units involved in the initial breakout would have been overwhelmed by the superior numbers of the enemy. The Frankish infantry opened gaps in their ranks for the knights to pass through and the attack naturally developed in echelon from the rear to the van. To the soldiers of Saladin's army, as Baha al-Din noted, the sudden change from passivity to ferocious activity {{on the part of}} the Crusaders was disconcerting, and <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> result of a preconceived plan.|$|E
5|$|In late October 2010, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{began to}} monitor a weak area of disorganized weather along the {{southern}} periphery of a frontal system, associated with a broad surface trough east-northeast of Puerto Rico. Supported by an upper-level low retrograding to its southwest, the system generated clusters of scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms, otherwise known as convection. The activity gradually enhanced as environmental conditions within its encounter became more favorable over time. Around 1200UTC October28, satellite imagery showed what <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> formation of a surface low within the trough. Shower and thunderstorm activity accordingly intensified, and the NHC assessed a high chance for tropical or subtropical development. At the time, the center of circulation remained poor; however, it became better defined later that day, with a stable amount of corresponding convection. Although the upper low had remained adjacent, it was located well to the southwest of the system's small wind radius, an atypical structure for a subtropical cyclone. The system was therefore operationally designated as Tropical Storm Shary at 0000UTC October 29, though post-season analysis revealed a tropical depression had formed by 1800 UTC October 28, about 520mi (830km) south-southeast of Bermuda. At the time of classification, the agency noted that Shary would be a relatively short-lived tropical cyclone due to a merge with a cold front forecast to occur within the following 48 hours.|$|E
5|$|Late in {{the morning}} of November 22, 1952, Loring led a flight of four F-80s on patrol over Kunwha. Upon radioing a forward air controller, he was told a T-6 Texan flying over Sniper Ridge had spotted a {{concentration}} of artillery near the ridge which was pinning down UN ground troops on the ridge. He was also told the artillery concentration was surrounded by a heavy presence of anti-aircraft guns. Loring ordered the flight to the location, spotting the artillery concentration. Immediately after Loring began his dive bombing run, he was spotted by the anti-aircraft batteries. The Chinese crews operating them were highly skilled, and even at a distance, the batteries fired an extremely accurate barrage which struck Loring's aircraft several times on the nose and fuselage. The fire disabled the aircraft. His wingmen, noting the damage, suggested he abort the bombing mission, as the flight was not far behind the lines and Loring's aircraft could have attempted the return trip. Instead, Loring ceased radio contact, and resumed what <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> standard bombing mission. At , however, Loring accelerated his aircraft at a 40-degree angle {{in what appeared to be}} a controlled maneuver, lining up the Chinese batteries. The other pilots reported they watched, stunned, as Loring dove his damaged aircraft into the battery position. Loring was killed instantly in the impact, but his action resulted in the complete destruction of the battery position.|$|E

25|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} shows that modern dog mDNA haplotypes resolve into four monophyletic clades with strong statistical support, and {{these have been}} designated by researchers as clades A-D. Other studies that included a wider sample of specimens have reported two rare East Asian clades E-F with weaker statistical support. In 2009, a study found that haplogroups A, B and C included 98% of dogs and are found universally distributed across Eurasia, indicating {{that they were the}} result of a single domestication event, and that haplogroups D, E, and F were rare and <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> result of regional hybridization with local wolves post-domestication.
