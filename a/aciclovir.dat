5|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, the {{development}} of antiviral drugs has increased rapidly, mainly driven by the AIDS pandemic. Antiviral drugs are often nucleoside analogues, which are molecules very similar, but not identical to DNA building blocks. When the replication of virus DNA begins, some of these fake building blocks are incorporated. As soon as that happens, replication stops prematurely—the fake building blocks lack the essential features that allow the addition of further building blocks. Thus, DNA production is halted, and the virus can no longer reproduce. Examples of nucleoside analogues are <b>aciclovir</b> for herpes virus infections and lamivudine for HIV and hepatitis B virus infections. <b>Aciclovir</b> {{is one of the}} oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.|$|E
5|$|Several {{antiviral}} {{drugs are}} effective for treating herpes, including acyclovir, valaciclovir (valacyclovir), famciclovir, and penciclovir. Acyclovir {{was the first}} discovered and is now available in generic. Valacyclovir is also available as a generic and is slightly more effective than <b>aciclovir</b> for reducing lesion healing time.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Condom use decreases the risk somewhat. Daily antiviral medication taken {{by someone who}} has the infection can also reduce spread. There is no available vaccine and once infected, there is no cure. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and topical lidocaine {{may be used to}} help with the symptoms. Treatments with antiviral medication such as <b>aciclovir</b> or valaciclovir can lessen the severity of symptomatic episodes.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous <b>aciclovir</b> {{may cause}} {{reversible}} nephrotoxicity {{in up to}} 5% to 10% of patients because of precipitation of <b>aciclovir</b> crystals in the kidney. <b>Aciclovir</b> crystalline nephropathy is more common when <b>aciclovir</b> is given as a rapid infusion and in patients with dehydration and preexisting renal impairment. Adequate hydration, a slower rate of infusion, and dosing based on renal function may reduce this risk.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aciclovir</b> is {{converted}} by viral thymidine kinase to <b>aciclovir</b> monophosphate, {{which is then}} converted by host cell kinases to <b>aciclovir</b> triphosphate (ACV-TP). ACV-TP, in turn, competitively inhibits and inactivates HSV-specified DNA polymerases preventing further viral DNA synthesis without affecting the normal cellular processes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aciclovir</b> {{taken by}} mouth {{does not appear}} to {{decrease}} the risk of pain after shingles. In those with herpes of the eye, <b>aciclovir</b> may be more effective and safer than idoxuridine. It is not clear if <b>aciclovir</b> eye drops are more effective than brivudine eye drops.|$|E
25|$|Interferon: Synergistic effects when {{administered}} with <b>aciclovir</b> and caution {{should be}} taken when administering <b>aciclovir</b> to patients receiving IV interferon.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aciclovir</b> topical {{cream is}} {{commonly}} associated (≥1% of patients) with: dry or flaking skin or transient stinging/burning sensations. Infrequent adverse effects include erythema or itch. When {{applied to the}} eye, <b>aciclovir</b> is commonly associated (≥1% of patients) with transient mild stinging. Infrequently (0.1–1% of patients), ophthalmic <b>aciclovir</b> is associated with superficial punctate keratitis or allergic reactions.|$|E
25|$|Probenecid: Reports of {{increased}} half life of <b>aciclovir,</b> {{as well as}} decreased urinary excretion and renal clearance have been shown in studies where probenecid is given simultaneously with <b>aciclovir.</b>|$|E
25|$|Reviews of {{research}} {{dating from the}} 1980s show there is some effect in reducing the number and duration of lesions if <b>aciclovir</b> is applied {{at an early stage}} of an outbreak. Research shows effectiveness of topical <b>aciclovir</b> in both the early and late stages of the outbreak as well as improving methodologically and in terms of statistical certainty from previous studies. <b>Aciclovir</b> trials show that this agent has no role in preventing HIV transmission, but it can help slow HIV disease progression in people not taking anti-retroviral therapy (ART). This finding emphasizes the importance of testing simple, inexpensive non-ART strategies, such as <b>aciclovir</b> and cotrimoxazole, in people with HIV.|$|E
25|$|Zidovudine: Although {{administered}} {{often with}} <b>aciclovir</b> in HIV patients, neurotoxicity {{has been reported}} in at least one patient who presented with extreme drowsiness and lethargy 30–60 days after receiving IV aciclovir; symptoms resolved when <b>aciclovir</b> was discontinued.|$|E
25|$|Acyclovir {{is poorly}} {{water-soluble}} and has poor oral bioavailability (15–30%), hence intravenous administration is necessary if high concentrations are required. When orally administered, peak plasma concentration occurs after 1–2 hours. <b>Aciclovir</b> {{has a high}} distribution rate; protein binding is reported to range from 9 to 33%. The elimination half-life (t1/2) of <b>aciclovir</b> depends according to age group; neonates have a t1/2 of 4 hours, children 1–12 years have a t1/2 of 2–3 hours whereas adults have a t1/2 of 3 hours.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a slight}} {{reduction}} {{in the incidence of}} pain at 4 weeks after the onset of rash in the <b>aciclovir</b> group (153 study participants with pain out of 347 study participants in the <b>aciclovir</b> group) versus the placebo group (184 study participants with pain out of 345 study participants in the placebo group). Patients who are prescribed PO antiviral agents after the onset of rash should be informed that their chances of developing PHN are no different than those not taking PO antiviral agents.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aciclovir</b> may be quantitated in plasma or serum {{to monitor}} for drug {{accumulation}} {{in patients with}} renal dysfunction or to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in acute overdose victims.|$|E
25|$|The first {{successful}} antiviral, <b>aciclovir,</b> is a nucleoside analogue, and is effective against herpesvirus infections. The first antiviral drug {{to be approved}} for treating HIV, zidovudine (AZT), is also a nucleoside analogue.|$|E
25|$|Another use of {{gene therapy}} is the {{introduction}} of enzymes into these cells that make them susceptible to particular chemotherapy agents; studies with introducing thymidine kinase in gliomas, making them susceptible to <b>aciclovir,</b> are in their experimental stage.|$|E
25|$|One review {{found that}} antivirals (such as <b>aciclovir)</b> are {{ineffective}} in improving recovery from Bell's palsy beyond steroids alone in {{mild to moderate}} disease. Another review found a benefit but stated the evidence was not very good to support this conclusion.|$|E
25|$|The {{mutation}} rate {{has been estimated}} to be ~1.38×10−7 substitutions/site/year. In clinical setting, the mutations in either the thymidine kinase gene or DNA polymerase gene has caused resistance to <b>aciclovir.</b> However, most of the mutations occur in the thymidine kinase gene rather than the DNA polymerase gene.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous <b>aciclovir</b> is {{effective}} to treat severe medical conditions caused by {{different species of}} the herpes virus family, including severe localized infections of herpes virus, severe genital herpes, chickenpox and herpetic encephalitis. It is also effective in systemic or traumatic herpes infections, eczema herpeticum and Herpes simplex meningitis.|$|E
25|$|Vince later went on {{to invent}} abacavir, an nRTI drug for HIV patients. Elion was awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine, partly for the {{development}} of <b>aciclovir.</b> Richard Whitley, a University of Alabama at Birmingham researcher and pioneer in antiviral therapy, was the first to successfully use the drug in humans.|$|E
25|$|Resistance to <b>aciclovir</b> is rare {{in people}} with healthy immune systems, but is more common (up to 10%) in people with immunodeficiencies on chronic {{antiviral}} prophylaxis (transplant recipients, people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome due to HIV infection). Mechanisms of resistance in HSV include deficient viral thymidine kinase; and mutations to viral thymidine kinase or DNA polymerase, altering substrate sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|Herpes viruses {{establish}} lifelong infections, and {{the virus}} cannot yet be eradicated from the body. Treatment usually involves general-purpose antiviral drugs {{that interfere with}} viral replication, reduce the physical severity of outbreak-associated lesions, and lower the chance of transmission to others. Studies of vulnerable patient populations have indicated that daily use of antivirals such as <b>aciclovir</b> and valaciclovir can reduce reactivation rates.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea and diarrhea. Potentially {{serious side effects}} include kidney {{problems}} and low platelets. Greater care is recommended in those with poor liver or kidney function. It is generally considered safe for use in pregnancy with no harm having been observed. It appears to be safe during breastfeeding. <b>Aciclovir</b> is a nucleic acid analogue made from guanosine. It works by decreasing {{the production of the}} virus's DNA.|$|E
25|$|If <b>aciclovir</b> by {{mouth is}} started within 24 hours of rash onset, it {{decreases}} symptoms by one day {{but has no}} effect on complication rates. Use of acyclovir therefore is not currently recommended for individuals with normal immune function. Children younger than 12 years old and older than one month are not meant to receive antiviral drugs unless they have another medical condition which puts them at risk of developing complications.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>aciclovir</b> {{was announced in}} 1977. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication and is marketed under many brand names worldwide. The wholesale cost as of 2014 to 2016 was between US$0.03 and US$0.12 for a typical dose by mouth. The cost of a typical course of treatment in the United States is less than US$25.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (≥1% of patients) {{associated with}} systemic <b>aciclovir</b> therapy (oral or IV) include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, encephalopathy (with IV use only), injection site reactions (with IV use only) and headache. In high doses, hallucinations have been reported. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include agitation, vertigo, confusion, dizziness, oedema, arthralgia, sore throat, constipation, abdominal pain, hair loss, rash and weakness. Rare adverse effects (<0.1% of patients) include coma, seizures, neutropenia, leukopenia, crystalluria, anorexia, fatigue, hepatitis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, {{thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura}} and anaphylaxis.|$|E
25|$|The {{varicella}} vaccine {{has resulted in}} a {{decrease in the number of}} cases and complications from the disease. It protects about 70 to 90 percent of people from disease with a greater benefit for severe disease. Routine immunization of children is recommended in many countries. Immunization within three days of exposure may improve outcomes in children. Treatment of those infected may include calamine lotion to help with itching, keeping the fingernails short to decrease injury from scratching, and the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) to help with fevers. For those at increased risk of complications antiviral medication such as <b>aciclovir</b> are recommended.|$|E
500|$|Antiviral {{drugs are}} often {{nucleoside}} analogues (fake DNA building-blocks), which viruses mistakenly incorporate into their genomes during replication. The life-cycle {{of the virus}} is then halted because the newly synthesised DNA is inactive. This is because these analogues lack the hydroxyl groups, which, along with phosphorus atoms, link together to form the strong [...] "backbone" [...] of the DNA molecule. This is called DNA chain termination. Examples of nucleoside analogues are <b>aciclovir</b> for Herpes simplex virus infections and lamivudine for HIV and Hepatitis B virus infections. <b>Aciclovir</b> {{is one of the}} oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Aciclovir</b> {{was seen}} as {{the start of a new}} era in {{antiviral}} therapy, as it is extremely selective and low in cytotoxicity. Since discovery in mid 1970s, it is being used as an effective drug for the treatment of infections caused by most known species of the Herpes virus family including Herpes zoster & Varicella zoster viruses. [...] Nucleosides isolated from a Caribbean sponge, Cryptotethya crypta, were the basis for the synthesis of <b>aciclovir.</b> It was codiscovered by Howard Schaffer following his work with Robert Vince, S. Bittner and S. Gurwara on the adenosine analog acycloadenosine which showed promising antiviral activity. Later, Schaffer joined Burroughs Wellcome and continued the development of <b>aciclovir</b> with pharmacologist Gertrude B. Elion. [...] A U.S. patent on <b>aciclovir</b> listing Schaffer as inventor was issued in 1979.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Aciclovir</b> is {{excreted}} in {{the breast}} milk, therefore {{it is recommended that}} caution should be used in breast-feeding women. [...] It has been shown in limited test studies that the nursing infant is exposed to approximately 0.3mg/kg/day following oral administration of <b>aciclovir</b> to the mother. If nursing mothers have herpetic lesions near or on the breast, breast-feeding should be avoided.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Aciclovir</b> {{is active}} against most {{species in the}} {{herpesvirus}} family. In descending order of activity: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Aciclovir</b> is the INN and [...] BAN while {{acyclovir}} is the USAN {{and former}} BAN.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Aciclovir</b> is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus infections, including: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Aciclovir</b> is {{recommended}} by the CDC for treatment of varicella during pregnancy, especially during {{the second and third}} trimesters ...|$|E
2500|$|Classified as a Category B Drug, the CDC {{and others}} have {{declared}} that during severe recurrent or first episodes of genital herpes, <b>aciclovir</b> may be used. [...] For severe HSV infections (especially disseminated HSV), IV <b>aciclovir</b> may also be used. [...] Studies in mice, rabbits and rats (with doses more than 10 times the equivalent of that used in humans) given during organogenesis have failed to demonstrate birth defects. Studies in rats {{in which they were}} given the equivalent to 63 times the standard steady-state humans concentrations of the drug on day 10 of gestation showed head and tail anomalies.|$|E
2500|$|Ketoconazole: In-vitro {{replication}} {{studies have}} found a synergistic, dose-dependent antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 when given with <b>aciclovir.</b> [...] However, this effect has not been clinically established and more studies {{need to be done}} to evaluate the true potential of this synergy.|$|E
