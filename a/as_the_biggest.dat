5|$|Born in Dallas, Texas, to Noel and Freida Bosh, Chris Bosh {{grew up in}} Hutchins, Texas. A family-oriented person, Bosh often played {{basketball}} {{in the house with}} his younger brother, Joel. By four years of age, he began learning how to dribble a basketball in the gym, where his dad played pick-up games. Although Bosh was always tall since youth and this allowed him to out-rebound others in basketball games, he only started learning the game around fourth grade at a playground near his grandmother's house. Apart from basketball, Bosh also played baseball up until high school, preferring to play as a first baseman. Growing up, Bosh names his parents <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> influences on his personality and considered NBA superstar Kevin Garnett as his favorite athlete, modeling his play after him. Academically, Bosh always did well in school, but he began to garner significant attention from college recruiters when he led Lincoln High School in Dallas to the number one ranking in the country and the USA Today National Championship with a perfect 40–0 season.|$|E
5|$|By 2004, Blink-182, {{consisting}} of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker, had emerged <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> pop punk {{act of the}} era, releasing the seven-times-multiplatinum Enema of the State (1999) and number one album Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001). The band took a brief break in 2002 when DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back, during which time he collected several darker musical ideas he felt unsuitable for Blink-182, compiling them into a record, Box Car Racer. The album, recorded {{with the help of}} Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy, was intended as a one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band with Barker behind the kit. The side project would cause great division between DeLonge and Hoppus, who was not included and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter and music on Box Car Racer edged its way into the Blink sound as well, and the band explored experimentalist elements on their next effort, an eponymous fifth studio album (2003). Geffen Records, after the success of Box Car Racer, offered DeLonge a solo recording deal, which he declined, feeling that it would cast a negative shadow over the band. Nevertheless, the possible deal loomed over the band, contributing to internal tension.|$|E
