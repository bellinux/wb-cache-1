A total of 118 clinical isolates of S. aureus (52 methicillin resistant), 50 S. epidermidis, 5 S. capitis, 2 S. hominis, 3 S. simulans, 6 S. saprophyticus, and 2 S. warneri were tested. The slide coagulase, TC and TNase tests detected 115 (97. 5 %), 117 (99. 2 %), and 118 (100 %) of the S. aureus isolates, respectively. All showed 100 % specificity.

40|$|A plug-based microﬂuidic {{approach}} {{was used to}} perform multiple <b>agglutination</b> <b>assays</b> in parallel without crosscontamination and using only microliter volumes of blood. To perform <b>agglutination</b> <b>assays</b> on-chip, a microﬂuidic device was designed to combine aqueous streams of antibody, buffer, and red blood cells (RBCs) to form droplets 30 - 40 nL in volume surrounded by a ﬂuorinated carrier ﬂuid. Using this approach, proof-of-concept ABO and D (Rh) blood typing and group A subtyping were successfully performed by screening against multiple antigens without cross-contamination. On-chip subtyping distinguished common A 1 and A 2 RBCs by using a lectinbased dilution assay. This ﬂexible platform was extended to differentiate rare, weakly agglutinating RBCs of A subtypes by analyzing agglutination avidity {{as a function of}} shear rate. Quantitative analysis of changes in contrast within plugs revealed subtleties in agglutination kinetics and enabled characterization of agglutination of rare blood subtypes. Finally, this platform was used to detect bacteria, demonstrating the potential usefulness of this assay in detecting sepsis and the potential for applications in agglutination-based viral detection.

50|$|Penicillium digitatum {{is used as}} a {{biological}} tool during the commercial production of latex agglutination kits. Latex agglutination detects Aspergillus and Penicillium species in foods by attaching antibodies specific for the extracellular polysaccharide of P. digitatum to 0.8 µm latex beads. This method has been successful in detecting contamination of grains and processed foods at a limit of detection of 5-10 ng/mL of antigen. In comparison to other detection assays, the latex agglutionation assay exceeds the detection limit of the Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and is as effective in detecting Aspergillus and Pencillium species as the ergosterol production assay. However, the latter displays an increased ability to detect Fusarium species when compared to the latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>assay.</b>|$|E
5000|$|To some extent, acute {{toxoplasmosis}} infections can be differentiated {{from chronic}} infections using an IgG avidity test, {{which is a}} variation on the ELISA. In the first response to infection, toxoplasma-specific IgG has a low affinity for the toxoplasma antigen; in the following weeks and month, IgG affinity for the antigen increases. Based on the IgG avidity test, if the IgG in the infected individual has a high affinity, it means that the infection began three to five months before testing. This is particularly useful in congenital infection, where pregnancy status and gestational age at time of infection determines treatment. [...] In contrast to IgG, IgM antibodies can be used to detect acute infection, but generally not chronic infection. The IgM antibodies appear sooner after infection than the IgG antibodies and disappear faster than IgG antibodies after recovery. In most cases, T. gondii-specific IgM antibodies can first be detected approximately a week after acquiring primary infection, and decrease within one to six months; 25% of those infected are negative for T. gondii-specific IgM within seven months. However, IgM may be detectable months or years after infection, during the chronic phase, and false positives for acute infection are possible. [...] The most commonly used tests for the measurement of IgM antibody are double-sandwich IgM-ELISA, the IFA test, and the immunosorbent <b>agglutination</b> <b>assay</b> (IgM-ISAGA). Commercial test kits often have low specificity, and the reported results are frequently misinterpreted.|$|E

Thus, the antiserum obtained was designated VT 3 antiserum. VT 3 antiserum reacted with intimin type γ. We assessed the reactivity of VT 3 antiserum to whole-cell lysates of 87 strains of E. coli and other enteric bacteria by immunoblotting.

40|$|The {{ability to}} detect {{infectious}} agents is a prerequisite to the treatment and containment of transmittable diseases. Many diagnostics assays are based upon the detection of antibodies in serum against the infectious agent and often rely on ELISA or <b>agglutination</b> based <b>assays</b> to determine the infectious status. Using function-spacer-lipid (FSL) constructs bearing peptides (1) representative of an infectious agent attached to human red blood cells, offers a potential alternative diagnostic approach to the detection of antibody-defined infections. Using the syphilis spirochaete as a model, and a peptide selection algorithm, a series of FSL constructs were created and attached to human red cells creating syphilis-kodecytes. These kodecytes were then tested in routine blood typing platforms against serum from patients and blood donors of known syphilis status. This approach has already been successfully used to detect ethnic specific blood group antibodies (1). It was found that syphilis-kodecytes used in blood grouping platforms are capable of the same sensitivity and specificity as ELISA and Particle <b>Agglutination</b> <b>assays.</b> The ability to engineer the FSL construct and replace the functional peptide for other infectious markers allows for a highly flexible and rapid-development technique {{for the detection of}} antibodydefined infectious agent markers, and may be an important lowtechnology tool for use in epidemics and pandemics, particularly in third world environments...|$|R
