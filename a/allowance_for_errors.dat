40|$|Allelic {{association}} {{provides a}} means to map disease genes that, in a dense map of polymorphic markers, has considerably higher resolution than linkage methods. We describe here a composite likelihood estimate of location for a disease gene against a high-resolution marker map by using allele frequencies at linked loci. Data may be family-based, as in the transmission disequilibrium test, or from a case-control study. χ 2 tests, logarithm of odds, standard errors, and information weights are provided. The method is illustrated by analysis of published cystic fibrosis haplotypes, in which ΔF 508 is more accurately localized than by other association studies. This differs from current approaches by adopting a more general Malecot model for isolation by distance, where distance here is between marker and disease locus, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> <b>errors</b> in the map and model, and freedom from assumptions about demography, systematic pressures, and the ratio of physical to genetic distance. When these assumptions are introduced the number of generations since the original mutation may be estimated, {{but this is not}} required to determine location and its standard error, so that evidence from allelic association may be efficiently combined with linkage evidence to identify a region for positional cloning of a disease gene...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{inversion}} of the accurately measured frequencies of solar oscillations determines the mechanical {{properties of the}} Sun, i. e., the sound speed and density {{as a function of}} solar radius. In order to infer the temperature and hydrogen abundance profiles inside the Sun, it becomes necessary to use, in addition, the equations of thermal equilibrium along with the input physics, such as opacities, equation of state and nuclear reaction rates. It then becomes possible to estimate the effects of uncertainties in opacity and nuclear reaction rates on the inferred thermal and composition profiles. The seismically determined temperature and hydrogen abundance profiles turn out to be close to those in a standard evolutionary solar model that includes the diffusion of helium and heavy elements below the convection zone. The most significant departure occurs just below the base of the convection zone where the inferred hydrogen abundance profile is smoother than that in a standard diffusion model. The region just beneath the solar convection zone appears to be mixed, a process which could account for the observed low lithium abundance in the solar envelope. With a reasonable <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> <b>errors</b> in opacities, the helioseismically estimated cross-section for pp nuclear reaction rate turns out to be (4. 15 +/- 0. 25) * 1.

40|$|Based on the Gaia DR 1 TGAS parallaxes and {{photometry}} {{from the}} Tycho- 2, Gaia, 2 MASS, and WISE catalogues, we {{have produced a}} sample of about 100 000 clump red giants within about 800 pc of the Sun. The systematic variations of the mode of their absolute magnitude {{as a function of}} the distance, magnitude, and other parameters have been analyzed. We show that these variations reach 0. 7 mag and cannot be explained by variations in the interstellar extinction or intrinsic properties of stars and by selection. The only explanation seems to be a systematic error of the Gaia DR 1 TGAS parallax dependent on the square of the observed distance in kpc: 0. 18 R^ 2 mas. <b>Allowance</b> <b>for</b> this <b>error</b> reduces significantly the systematic dependences of the absolute magnitude mode on all parameters. This error reaches 0. 1 mas within 800 pc of the Sun and allows an upper limit for the accuracy of the TGAS parallaxes to be estimated as 0. 2 mas. A careful <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> such <b>errors</b> is needed to use clump red giants as "standard candles". This eliminates all discrepancies between the theoretical and empirical estimates of the characteristics of these stars and allows us to obtain the first estimates of the modes of their absolute magnitudes from the Gaia parallaxes: mode(M_H) =- 1. 49 ^m± 0. 04 ^m, mode(M_K_s) =- 1. 63 ^m± 0. 03 ^m, mode(M_W 1) =- 1. 67 ^m± 0. 05 ^m, mode(M_W 2) =- 1. 67 ^m± 0. 05 ^m, mode(M_W 3) =- 1. 66 ^m± 0. 02 ^m, mode(M_W 4) =- 1. 73 ^m± 0. 03 ^m, as well as the corresponding estimates of their de-reddened colors.

We show that the size of the forecastable changes in output greatly exceeds that predicted by a standard stochastic growth model, of the kind studied by real business cycle theorists. Contrary to the model's implications, forecastable movements in labor productivity are small and only weakly related to forecasted changes in output. Also, forecasted movements in investment and hours are positively correlated with forecasted movements in output. Finally, and again in contrast to what the growth model implies, forecasted output movements are positively related to the current level of the consumption share and negatively related to the level of hours.

40|$|Parentage {{assignment}} {{is becoming increasingly}} popular {{as a means of}} monitoring the effects of aquaculture husbandry practices. As the complexity of such studies increase, likelihood-based methods for assignment are coming to the fore since, theoretically at least, they offer the possibility of accurate assignment with less screening overheads (fewer loci, less cost) compared to exclusion-based methods. We were able to explore this assertion through the analysis of the parental contribution to 300 Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) fiy produced from a commercial mass spawning tank (containing 99 broodstock) on a single day. Five polymorphic DNA microsatellite loci were screened and three different datasets generated: 'error prone' raw genotypic data from automated allele calling; manually corrected data; and corrected data from a reduced number of loci (four). Parentage analysis was performed by three software packages-PAPA, CERVUS and FAP-which all have been used in aquaculture contexts. PAPA and CERVUS perform likelihood-based analyses, while FAP is exclusion-based. Striking differences in the allocation performance were noted both among programs and among datasets. With no <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> <b>error</b> all three programs flagged up potential problems within datasets, particularly the error prone 'raw' genotypes. When <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> a presumed low level of error was invoked using PAPA (uniform error rate = 0. 0001 - 0. 02) parentage was assigned for virtually all offspring, irrespective of the dataset used. Despite simulations suggesting that these assignments were likely to be accurate (correctness values > 95 %) substantial numbers of assignments (up to 18 %) differed among the datasets. FAP gave more conservative (maximum of c. 78 % of assignments resolved) and consistent assignments. The power of assignment declined significantly when only four loci were considered. CERVUS performed relatively poorly in terms of numbers of assignments made. Where comparisons were possible most of the identified parental-pairs agreed with FAP allocations. Reliance on likelihood-based assignments alone to resolve parentage in complex mass spawning tanks may be inappropriate. Furthermore, reducing the number of loci to a minimal set (based on likelihood predictions) could be counterproductive. Allocation methods should be more thoroughly assessed and fully described.

The measured depletions are clearly correlated with n sub H, the mean hydrogen column density along the line of sight. Depletions also seem to be weakly correlated with various ratios of hydrogen to extinction by dust grains and also variations of extinction with wavelength, although part of these effects are a secondary result of the correlation with n sub H. The apparent coupling of depletion to the mean density are interpreted in terms of an idealized model due to Spitzer (1985), where each element has one value of depletion in the low-density, warm, neutral gas and an enhanced, different value in cold clouds. The difference of apparent depletions for Mg, P, Cl, Mn, and Fe between warm and cold clouds averages 0. 44 + or - 0. 12 (rms) dex, and, after an <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> observational <b>errors</b> is made, the scatter of individual depletions from the overall trend predicted by method is only about 0. 10 dex.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{traditional}} approach relying on sight reduction tables, a non-programmatic {{location of the}} position fix and an inadequate <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> observation <b>errors</b> is still widely pursued and advocated. In the late 1970 s the programmatic Least Squares method (LSQ) was introduced which determines a random <b>error</b> fix (FixQ) <b>for</b> any multiple sights combination. B. D Yallop & C. Y Hohenkerk (1985) expanded LSQ to incorporate the computation of the random error margin of a fix. Several marketed PDA-based programs apply LSQ, but none have fully incorporated the random error margin {{as a guide for}} the navigator. All existing LSQ applications have two drawbacks. One is, all observation error is attributed to random sources, whereas the possibility of systematic error has in fact a long theoretical and practical background in celestial navigation. Systematic error represents a bias in statistical random error theory and can and should be allowed for. A major drawback is that existing LSQ program applications incorporate the running fix technique (RFT) traditionally applied in coastal navigation. It has no general validity in celestial navigation. The position circle of an earlier celestial sight can only be mathematically correctly transferred when its Geometric Position (GP) is transferred for the run data. A final aspect of reliability is the strategy adopted at the sight planning stage. At least during twilight observations, navigators should aim at getting three or four sights with a total azimuth angle> 180 o, with three successive subsights on each body. In such configurations FixQ and FixS will b...|$|R
40|$|In a disc galaxy the {{distribution}} of azimuthal components of velocity is very skew. In the past this skewness has been modelled by superposed Gaussians. We use dynamical arguments to derive an analytic formula that can be fitted to observed velocity distributions, and validate it by fits to the velocities derived from a dynamically rigorous model, and {{to a sample of}} local stars with accurate space velocities. Our formula is much easier to use than a full distribution function. It has fewer parameters than a multi-Gaussian fit, and the best-fitting model parameters give insight into the underlying disc dynamics. In particular, once the azimuthal velocities of a sample have been successfully fitted, the apparatus provides a prediction for the corresponding distribution of radial velocities vR. An effective formula like ours is invaluable when fitting to data for stars at some distance from the Sun because it enables one to make proper <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the <b>errors</b> in distance and proper motion when determining the underlying disc kinematics. The derivation of our formula elucidates the way the horizontal and vertical motions are closely intertwined, and makes it evident that no stellar population can have a scale height and vertical velocity dispersions that are simultaneously independent of radius. We show that the oscillation of a star perpendicular to the Galactic plane modifies the effective potential in which the star moves radially {{in such a way that}} the more vertical energy a star has, the larger is the mean radius of its orbit.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the guidance methodology needed to implement networks of autonomously-flown unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) controlled by centralized ground stations (GSs). The intended operations {{would take place}} within a local area with a diameter of less than 10 km for most applications but potentially as large as 50 - 100 km. UAVs in these networks are envisioned to be potentially quite small and inexpensive but capable of automated flight orientation and stability with guidance updates provided by the GS at 0. 5 to 2 second intervals. The GS also provides GNSS differential corrections and integrity information to support sub-meter-level 95 % navigation accuracy with 10 - 7 error bounds in the 3 - 10 meter range. Position and timing solutions for each UAV are relayed back to the GS and support both operational (route planning) and tactical (path updating) guidance. This guidance needs to insure safe separation between UAVs within the network and (depending on the airspace used) separation from "out-of-network " UAVs as well as manned aircraft. The proposed guidance approach centers around "zones of influence " surrounding each UAV that include <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> navigation <b>error,</b> UAV guidance error, and ground-system guidance error.
