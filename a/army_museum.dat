5|$|On 6 July 1967, Maxwell {{collapsed}} {{and died of}} a heart attack in a street in his home town Matraville, New South Wales. He had been an invalid pensioner for some time. His funeral service took place with full military honours at St Mathias Anglican Church, Paddington. Having been cremated, his ashes were interred at the Eastern Suburbs Crematorium in Botany. Anne Maxwell presented her husband's medals to the <b>Army</b> <b>Museum</b> of New South Wales at Victoria Barracks, Paddington, and subsequently the medals, together with a portrait and a brass copy of his VC citation, were unveiled by the Minister of Defence, Allan Fairhall. In 2003, Maxwell's medals were presented to the Australian War Memorial on a permanent loan basis.|$|E
5|$|While the Rooms {{were not}} open to the general public, they could be {{accessed}} by appointment, with access being restricted to small groups. Even so, by the 1970s (with responsibility for the Rooms having passed to the Department for the Environment in 1975) {{tens of thousands of}} requests to visit the Rooms were being received every year, of which only 5,000 were successful. Meanwhile, the atmospheric conditions of the site, being dry and dusty, were having a detrimental effect on the rooms' furnishings and historic maps and other documents. The prospect was raised of decanting the contents of the Rooms to an established museum, with the National <b>Army</b> <b>Museum</b> and Imperial War Museum being suggested as candidates. In the event, £7,000 was secured to conserve the material in situ.|$|E

In 1949, the building was Grade I listed; the round tower was separately Grade I listed at the same time, and the 17th-century southern and western boundary walls of the park were Grade II listed in 1974.

5|$|The {{ships of}} the class saw no further {{significant}} action during the war, and were ceded to the Allies {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Versailles. All four ships were stricken from the German navy on 5 November 1919. Helgoland was taken by the British and was scrapped in 1921 in Morecambe. Her bow ornament was retained and was eventually returned to Germany; it is now on display in the Dresden <b>army</b> <b>museum.</b> Oldenburg was surrendered to the Japanese, but they did not take possession of the ship. Instead, they sold the vessel to a British salvage firm that scrapped it in Dordrecht in 1921. Thüringen was taken by France; the ship was nearly scuttled by her crew while en route to Cherbourg in 1920. She was used as a target until she was beached in 1923 at Gavres. She was broken up in situ, but a large portion of the hull remains off shore.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} history of the <b>Army</b> Medical <b>Museum</b> and its contributions to American medical science between 1862 and 1913. I argue that <b>Army</b> Medical <b>Museum,</b> built to commemorate, celebrate and critique the battlefield medicine of the Civil War, laid the foundation for the development of medical science in the American context. The staff of the <b>Army</b> Medical <b>Museum</b> pioneered a uniquely American museological science practice during and after the war, by collecting, arranging, and analyzing specimens, case histories and statistics to produce cutting-edge medical knowledge. The <b>Army</b> Medical <b>Museum</b> facilitated the reconstruction of both a grieving nation and the bodies and medicine torn apart by war, through museological exhibits and a medical history of the war. In {{the last quarter of the}} nineteenth century, the staff of the <b>Army</b> Medical <b>Museum</b> demonstrated the usefulness of museological science practice through original research in microscopy, comparative anatomy, and anthropology. I argue that it was the <b>Army</b> Medical <b>Museum's</b> inherent accommodation of scientific investigation of medicine that allowed it to become more broadly an institution for medical research in the twentieth century, but this privileging of research over Museum work ultimately contributed the decline of the <b>Army</b> Medical <b>Museum</b> as a pathoanatomical museum. This dissertation contributes to understanding the development of modern medicine in the nineteenth century, investigating how the Civil War provided the circumstances in which a uniquely American medical science could be created and tested over and over again. The <b>Army</b> Medical <b>Museum</b> took shape as a collection of medical material for pedagogical display. Its status as a national government institution, its connection with the Surgeon General's Library, and its staff of renowned physicians who had volunteered in the Civil War, all shaped the <b>Army</b> Medical <b>Museum's</b> scope and purpose from 1865 - 1913. This context set it apart from other medical museums, national museums, and research institutes. By tracing the development of the <b>Army</b> Medical <b>Museum</b> and the medical research, knowledge, and practice it shaped, we can come to better understand the impact of the Civil War on American medical practice and the trajectory of American medical scienc...|$|R
