5|$|TETCO was {{the brainchild}} of {{corporate}} lawyers Charles Francis and James Elkins, who convinced the construction specialists George and Herman Brown, and the fuel engineer E. Holley Poe, that buying the Big and Little Inch pipelines could be a lucrative opportunity. The corporation was established specifically {{for the purposes of the}} bid, and came to their bidding figure by estimating that the likely competition would bid at $130 million; their own figure exceeded this by 10 percent, and added on $127,000 to avoid a suspiciously round number. TETCO believed it could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this offer because it intended to reuse the electric motors in the oil pumping mechanisms for moving the natural gas; it also believed that the price of gas would rise considerably in the post-war markets.|$|E
5|$|With the {{breakthrough}} of third wave ska into the American mainstream by late 1996, the Daddies seemed poised for commercial success, landing {{a spot on}} a well-publicized national tour with popular ska bands Reel Big Fish and Let's Go Bowling. Although the band were mainly playing ska shows at the time, they soon began drawing a sizable following for their swing material when the coincident success of the film Swingers and its featured band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy started drawing public and media attention towards the formerly underground swing revival movement. When fans regularly began approaching the band's merchandise table asking which of their albums contained the most swing, the Daddies realized they lacked an album fully representing their swing side, prompting the band's manager to convince them to compile all of their swing songs onto one CD until they could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a new album, using their available finances to record several bonus tracks for inclusion. The result, , became an unexpectedly popular item as the band went on tour, reportedly selling as many as 4,000 copies a week through their Northwest distributors.|$|E
5|$|The Free State {{began using}} its new-found {{control of the}} region to levy taxes from the local population, {{gathered}} using similar hostage tactics to the Manyema. The taxes were initially collected {{in the form of}} ivory but when ivory supplies began to run low the Free State switched to natural rubber. The rubber was collected from Landolphia owariensis gentilii rubber vines which were relatively scarce in the area with an average frequency of around one plant in each acre. The rubber was gathered by tapping a rubber vine and placing a pot beneath to collect the latex which could be used in the production of rubber for the European market. If the vines were a long distance from the ground the gatherer would have had to climb a tree, tap the plant and hold the collecting pot beneath the vine, possibly for an entire day. Hence rubber collection was a labour-intensive process which made it unpopular with the villagers. Indeed, they preferred the Manyema to the Free State authorities as the Manyema only took low bulk, high value items such as ivory or slaves because of the long distances from their homeland whereas the state, with its steamboat transports, could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the people harvest the low value high bulk rubber. By September 1892 the Free State was using its military forces to attack and occupy villages in the Lulonga and Maringa river valleys to expand its tax base.|$|E

25|$|Deloitte {{announced}} in April 2014 {{that the building}} was again being put up for sale, with an expected price of £550 million. The current owners could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> loan repayments, citing differences {{in the value of}} the multi-currency loan and the British pound, high interest rates and general financing structure.

25|$|American Motors also {{introduced}} an optional Volkswagen/Audi-designed 2.0L (122cuin) I4 engine, {{which was also}} available in the Gremlin and later the Spirit. The engine {{was the same as}} used in the Porsche 924, although the Porsche was fitted with Bosch fuel injection instead of the carburetors on the AMC models. This engine provided improved economy, but was not as powerful as the standard six-cylinder engine. Because of the expense of acquiring the rights to the new 2.0L engine, AMC could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it standard equipment.|$|E

50|$|While {{focussing}} on {{still lifes}} and portraits, Ritsema's works were described in 1947 by critic Johan van Eikeren {{as if they}} could have been produced by a man - something that was considered to be a compliment in those years. He work was usually well sold, although she was not such a master that she could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> refuse <b>to</b> <b>make</b> compromises. In her portraits there is a clear difference between those of her relatives and direct connections, which are painted rather realistic, and those of models - which are usually more impressionist.|$|R
50|$|The {{very large}} {{incentives}} given to pharmaceutical companies to produce orphan drugs {{have led to}} the impression that the financial support <b>afforded</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> these drugs possible is akin to abuse. Because drugs can be used to treat multiple conditions, companies can take drugs that were filed with their government agency as orphan drugs to receive financial assistance, and then market it to a wide population to increase their profit margin. For example AstraZeneca's cholesterol drug Crestor was filed as a treatment for the rare disease pediatric familial hypercholesterolemia. After the drug was approved for orphan drug designation, and AstraZeneca had received tax breaks and other advantages, AstraZeneca later applied and received FDA approval for the drug to be used to treat cholesterol in all diabetics.|$|R
25|$|Bird skin parka (tamacenaq in Yup'ik) {{made from}} skins of birds of the Alcidae, Anatidae, Gaviidae, and Laridae families. Bird skins make {{very good and}} warm parkas. Thick bird skin parkas were ideal winter wear but were also used during cold weather in summer. Yupik (Yup'ik, Siberian Yupik, Sugpiaq ~ Alutiiq) and Inuit (Inupiaq) Eskimo seamstresses had {{regional}} variations in bird skin preparation techniques and bird skin parka styles and bird skin clothing-production techniques. Bird skin parkas are rarely made today and the skill is quickly disappearing among skin sewers in their region. During the 19th century, many Yup'iks along the coast between the Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers wore bird skins. Every year, one could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a bird skin parka because birds returned in such abundance. A plump Yup'ik baby trussed up in eider skin smiled from a warm, dry, cushioned world.|$|E
500|$|Joseph Bertin {{wrote in}} his 1735 {{textbook}} The Noble Game of Chess, [...] "He that plays first, is understood to have the attack." [...] This {{is consistent with the}} traditional view that White, by virtue of the first move, begins with the initiative and should try to extend it into the middlegame, while Black should strive to neutralize White's initiative and attain equality. Because White begins with the initiative, a minor mistake by White generally leads only to loss of the initiative, while a similar mistake by Black may have more serious consequences. Thus, Sveshnikov wrote in 1994, [...] "Black players cannot <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> even the slightest mistake ... from a theoretical point of view, the tasks of White and Black in chess are different: White has to strive for a win, Black—for a draw!" ...|$|E

50|$|A {{combination}} of the Great Depression and having too small of a stadium that could have never accommodated enough fans <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the team profitable caused great financial difficulties for the team.

500|$|At the quarter-final stage, Wanderers drew 0–0 with Crystal Palace (a defunct former amateur club not {{connected}} to the current professional club of the same name). Rather than be made to replay the match, however, both teams were permitted to go through to the semi-finals {{under one of the}} competition's original rules, which stated that {{in the event of a}} drawn match the teams would either be made to play again or both progress to the next round, at the organising committee's discretion. The Engineers beat Hampstead Heathens 2–0. [...] In the semi-finals Wanderers took on the leading Scottish club Queen's Park [...] who, due to a combination of walkovers and byes, had reached this stage of the competition without actually playing a match. [...] The rules of the competition stated that all matches from the semi-final stage onwards would take place at Kennington Oval in London and, after being held to a 0–0 draw, the Scottish club could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the lengthy trip from Glasgow a second time for a replay and withdrew from the competition, sending Wanderers into the final.

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the model year, the Gremlin was {{available}} with either the standard [...] or optional [...] six-cylinder engines. Both had increased power from updated cylinder heads and two-barrel carburetors. In addition, AMC offered a carbureted four-cylinder engine: a Volkswagen/Audi [...] inline-four, also used in fuel-injected form in the Porsche 924. It gave better fuel economy but less power than the standard six-cylinder engines, and reduced the Gremlin's weight by , allowing it to achieve an EPA rating of [...] in the city, and [...] on the highway. It was reserved for the Custom version of the Gremlin because the expense of acquiring the rights to the engine meant that AMC could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it standard equipment.

[...] Instead, Oppenheimer insisted that the workshop be placed without a wall, right next to the main entrance so that visitors could experience [...] "the way a shop smells when you burn the wood in a saw, or smell the oil from a lathe". Above the workshop was a sign, made by the wife of George Gamow, a physicist, educator, and friend of Oppenheimer who had died just a year before the opening of the Exploratorium.

50|$|Despite Fitzroy being a {{successful}} and strongly competitive club from the 1890s to the 1950s, winning eight VFL premierships and one VFA premiership, the 1966 VFL season is arguably {{considered to be}} what {{was the beginning of}} the club's hardships, when tenancy issues arose with the club's spiritual home of Brunswick Street Oval. The difficulties with operations and maintenance of the stadium, caused by the unwillingness of the cricket club and the local city Council to work with the club in repairing and renovating the venue, saw them never play a VFL match again at the oval, with the club relocating five times between Princes Park, the Junction Oval, the Western Oval and Victoria Park respectively. The cricket club to this day has constantly been criticised for playing a part in the football club's downfall, as at the time, the football club could've <b>afforded</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> desperately needed repairs to the venue that the cricket club declined and ultimately blocked, again ultimately damaging the long term viability of the football club.
