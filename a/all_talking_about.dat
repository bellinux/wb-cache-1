2500|$|You pledged {{during the}} last debate {{that you would not}} raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of {{everything}} is going up, and we all know it. Health care costs, as you <b>all</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> is skyrocketing, the cost of the war. My question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children? ...|$|E
2500|$|Digital Spy {{wondered}} if {{there could be a}} further twist where one of the five named suspects is not the culprit, as the BBC said there would be [...] "at least" [...] five. Soaplife added Joey Branning (David Witts) as a wild card, saying, [...] "there hasn't been a good soap toyboy storyline in we can't remember how long. And when they're done and done good, they're very, very good. It would actually be the one affair we'd understand Kat's motivation for." [...] Jacqueline Jossa, who plays Max's daughter Lauren Branning, said that the cast were so [...] "desperate" [...] to know who Kat's lover was that she tricked them into believing it was Peter Andre, saying, [...] "No one at all knows who Kat's having the affair with, we're <b>all</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> it on set. Some people have started winding other people up saying they've been told but they won't say who it is. I started a rumour around the set {{that it would be a}} celebrity guest appearance. I said it would be Peter Andre and some of the new cast believed it as well!" [...] Tony Discipline, who plays Michael's half-brother Tyler Moon, {{wondered if}} Kat's lover could actually be a woman. However, Digital Spy reported that episodes in September 2012 would make it [...] "pretty much certain" [...] that Kat's lover is one of the named suspects. After the identity of Kat's lover was revealed, Richie said he would have loved it to have been Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) or Tanya.|$|E

50|$|In the Series IV DVD commentary, {{the cast}} <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> how most fans dislike the episode, speculating {{that perhaps it}} wasn't 'space-y' enough. In contrast, the cast <b>all</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> their love for it and how many classic scenes it contains.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'd {{better come}} in and tell us about it," [...] the captain insisted. [...] "That's what we're <b>all</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> at the present moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I only {{mentioned}} his name, because, as I said, {{he was over}} with us the other day at Framley, and we were <b>all</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> your affair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was sitting}} upon his bed," [...] said Letty, [...] "and we were <b>all</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> you when my Lady mamma came. Are mothers kinder than Lady mammas?" ...|$|E
50|$|Aminata is a play {{written by}} Francis Imbuga. It stars Aminata {{as the main}} {{character}} with Jumba as her uncle who are the main antagonist and protagonist. It <b>all</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> women emancipation and change in society due to modernisation.|$|R
60|$|After {{the meal}} Dave spent a {{pleasant}} evening with Laura and Jessie. The three young folks {{went out on}} the porch and there, a little later, Ben Basswood joined them. <b>All</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> the trip to Yellowstone Park, and about the Landslide Mine.|$|R
5000|$|... "But it is {{essential}} to remember that in the final analysis - and <b>all</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> global functions of the various sorts to the contrary notwithstanding - there are no such things as global functions: and when we speak of such functions we are ultimately <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> our own notational conventions for referring to sets." ...|$|R
60|$|The boys {{walked through}} the small lobby of the hotel and into the smoking room. Here several men were congregated, <b>all</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the storm and the {{prospects}} of getting away.|$|E
60|$|The {{big room}} echoed with the {{pleasant}} sound of girlish voices and low laughter, {{for in a}} fortnight school would close for the holidays, and they were <b>all</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> their plans and anticipations.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, what they're <b>all</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> That {{she is so}} awfully radiant. That she's so tremendously happy. It's the question," [...] he explained, [...] "of what in {{the world}} she has to make her so." ...|$|E
5000|$|In his First World War {{autobiography}} Good-Bye to All That, {{the writer}} Robert Graves attributes the term [...] "Blitey" [...] to the Hindustani word for [...] "home". [...] He writes: [...] "The men are pessimistic but cheerful. They <b>all</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> getting a 'cushy' one {{to send them}} back to 'Blitey'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ill {{need you}} both," [...] went on Neale, thoughtfully. [...] "We've a big job. We've {{got to put}} a force of men on the piers while we're {{building}} the trestle... Maybe I'll fall down myself. Heavens! I've made blunders myself. I can't condemn you fellows. I'm willing to call off <b>all</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> past performances and begin over again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a great}} happiness," [...] said Mirah, [...] "to see the son {{and brother}} come into this dear home. And I hear them <b>all</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> what they did {{together}} when they were little. That seems like heaven, {{and to have a}} mother and brother who talk in that way. I have never had it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good many, I'm afraid. <b>All</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> you.... It's up to you. All {{you got to}} do is {{not think}} you know it all, and keep still. Keep still till you {{understand}} the faculty's difficulties just a little better. Savvy? Don't that sound fairly reasonable?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{has been}} charming," [...] John {{declared}} promptly, [...] "but she is surrounded {{with all sorts}} of people I don't know. I can't help her. For one thing, my French is absurd. Then they are <b>all</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> things which I don't understand in the least." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What--were you <b>all</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> me, my dear?' {{said the}} genial young {{man when he}} had {{finished}} his crowing and resumed human manners. 'Why what's the matter,' he went on. 'You look struck all of a heap.' Mr. Miller spread an aspect of concern over his own face, and drew a chair up to the fire.|$|E

5000|$|Though {{regarded}} as an unconventional teacher, Mazu's teachings emphasise Buddha-nature: Let each of you see into his own mind. ... However eloquently I may <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> kinds of things as innumerable as the sands of the Ganges, the Mind shows no increase... You may talk ever so much about it, {{and it is still}} your Mind; you may not at <b>all</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it, and it is just the same your own Mind.|$|R
50|$|The DVD Micke Dubois - Mycket Mer Än Bara Svullo (Micke Dubois - Much More Than Just Svullo) was {{released}} in 2006. It contained some Angne och Svullo sketches, bloopers and outtakes from Knäppa Klipp and a special tribute with celebrities including Ulf Malmros (who directed Den Elake Polisen), Markoolio and Sven Melander who <b>all</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> the energy and charisma of Dubois.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is." [...] She {{spoke in}} a low, firm voice and with deliberation. [...] "It is of my own free will. You have disgraced me so that I am ashamed to meet my friends. They are <b>all</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> me, I know. That is all I can tell you. You have made me very unhappy, and I never wish to see you again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And am I not yours, dear," [...] she asked,--"foolishly, unwisely perhaps, but {{certainly}} yours?--They were <b>all</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> you to-night at dinner and I was so proud," [...] she went on, a little feverishly. [...] "Our host was almost eloquent. He said that Democracy led by you, instead of proving a curse, {{might be the}} salvation of the country, because you have political insight and imperialistic ideas. It is those terrible people who would make a parish council of Parliament from whom one has most to fear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had a {{talk with}} Charlotte just now. She came to get some flannel for Mrs. Long. She says she will make it up for her, if the old woman can have {{it out of the}} club. Well, she says it is quite {{striking}} how all those girls have been moved by Mr. Soulsby's sermon on Friday evening. Amy came home and nearly said it all off to her Aunt Rose, and the girls were <b>all</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> it in the workroom in the morning, full of earnestness to make some effort." ...|$|E
50|$|Booky goes to {{the dance}} with Georgie. He turns up late and surprises her. He kisses her and that's <b>all</b> she <b>talks</b> <b>about.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, he is,' said Violet sadly. 'There is {{no other}} cousin named Mark. Why, don't you {{remember}} <b>all</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Mrs. Finch?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Of the match, Nixon said, [...] "that was {{an amazing}} game of cricket. There was some {{tremendous}} batting from West Indies. We had to do something, we'd <b>all</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> Duncan Fletcher and {{it means a lot}} for him. The lads paced the game so well. Michael Vaughan played beautifully, Kevin Pietersen came in and played magnificently and then the Leicestershire partnership finished it off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} the truth," [...] the girl continued. [...] "I was fool enough once {{to come here to}} meet that man"--she pointed to De la Borne--"that is all over. But one night I was restless, and I came {{wandering}} through the plantation here. It was then I saw from the other end that the place had been altered, and it struck me to listen there where the air-shaft is. I heard voices, and the next day they were <b>all</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the disappearance of Lord Ronald Engleton. You, I suppose," [...] she added, [...] "are Lord Ronald." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had just}} left the room in which I sat with Basil Grant and his brother Rupert, the voluble amateur detective. And as I say was {{invariably}} the case, we were <b>all</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> him. Rupert Grant was a clever young fellow, but he had that tendency which youth and cleverness, when sharply combined, so often produce, a somewhat extravagant scepticism. He saw doubt and guilt everywhere, and it was meat and drink to him. I had often got irritated with this boyish incredulity of his, but on this particular occasion I am bound to say that I thought him so obviously right that I was astounded at Basil's opposing him, however banteringly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{having been}} <b>all</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> her, we watched {{to see if}} she was going to anchor there or keep on to the east. She lowered a boat as she passed, and two men landed. They threw her up into the wind and waited until the boat came off again. The men did not come back in her. They hoisted the boat up again and went east. She stopped off Seaview; then she came back and sent the boat ashore, and two men went off in her. Of course, I can't say whether they were the same. It was as much as I could do to make out that there were two of them, though our glass is a pretty good one. Is there {{anything}} wrong about the craft?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's not a secret," [...] she cried. [...] "Do {{you suppose}} that the whole street--the whole of London, for that matter---- Get away, Austin, we don't want you here. Do you suppose they don't <b>all</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> you? Where is your dignity? You, a man {{who should have been}} Regius Professor at a great University with a {{thousand}} students all revering you. Where is your dignity, George?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mutato nomine, {{it is all}} the same. Don't the barristers' wives <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Circuit? Don't the soldiers' ladies {{gossip about}} the Regiment? Don't the clergymen's ladies {{discourse}} about Sunday-schools and who takes whose duty? Don't the very greatest ladies of <b>all</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> that small clique of persons to whom they belong? And why should our Indian friends not have their own conversation?--only I admit it is slow for the laymen whose fate it sometimes is to sit by and listen.|$|R
6000|$|... "And with <b>all</b> this <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> woman we {{have not}} yet touched the hem of her garment," [...] Graham said, winning a {{grateful}} look from Paula and Leo.|$|R
