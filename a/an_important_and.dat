5|$|The use of {{the term}} bhakti, meaning devotion, is not {{confined}} to any one deity. However, Krishna is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> popular focus of the devotionalism tradition within Hinduism, particularly among the Vaishnava sects. Devotees of Krishna subscribe to the concept of lila, meaning 'divine play', as the central principle of the universe. It is a form of bhakti yoga, one of three types of yoga discussed by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the heavy}} {{forestation}} in the area, sawmilling was <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> early industry, starting in the 1830s. In the early 20th century, there were around 20 sawmills in Meander and the surrounding localities. Due to a move towards closer settlement—smaller land plots and resulting greater population density—demand for timber in Meander increased and new sawmills were built in Meander in the 1910s and 1920s. Some of these mills continued into the late 20th century. Sawmilling later declined, partly {{due to lack of}} timber. Timberworld is the only remaining sawmill, though this is not its only business. It opened in 1985 as a sawmill supplying local Australian blackwood, myrtle beach and Blackheart Sassafras, originally operating from the former Baptist Church building. From 1990 it was owned and run by Kerin Booth and Kim Booth and it relocated to the former site of the Cummings Bros sawmill. Kim Booth, leader of the Tasmanian Greens, later passed management of the company to his son, Bronte. At one time Timberworld employed 30 people. The company now focuses on supply of prefabricated homes.|$|E

5|$|During the 9th century, Byzantium had {{gradually}} recovered {{its strength}} and internal stability while the Caliphate had become increasingly impotent and fractured. Under Kourkouas's leadership, the Byzantine armies advanced deep into Muslim territory {{for the first}} time in almost 200 years, expanding the imperial border. The emirates of Melitene and Qaliqala were conquered, extending Byzantine control to the upper Euphrates and over western Armenia. The remaining Iberian and Armenian princes became Byzantine vassals. Kourkouas also played a role in the defeat of a major Rus' raid in 941 and recovered the Mandylion of Edessa, <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> holy relic believed to depict the face of Jesus Christ. He was dismissed in 944 as a result of the machinations of Romanos Lekapenos's sons but restored to favour by Emperor Constantine VII (r. 913–959), serving as imperial ambassador in 946. His subsequent fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sources}} {{considered}} so far, Troilus' only narrative function is his death. The {{treatment of the}} character changes in two ways {{in the literature of}} the medieval and renaissance periods. First, he becomes <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> active protagonist in the pursuit of the Trojan War itself. Second, he becomes an active heterosexual lover, rather than the passive victim of Achilles' pederasty. By the time of John Dryden's neo-classical adaptation of Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida it is the ultimate failure of his love affair that defines the character.|$|E
5|$|Others {{argue that}} while the issues of {{increasing}} public costs are real, the importance of continued growth of OHSU for the city's economy must be factored in as well. Not only is it the largest employer in the city, but OHSU is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> effective vehicle to attract both federal funding, totaling more than 168million dollars for 2005, and a highly skilled workforce to the area. The growth in the current campus on the Marquam Hill is limited by access roads and parking, an expansion of which would likely cause more dramatic harm to the surrounding communities.|$|E

5|$|The Finnish and Swedish militaries {{engaged in}} wide-ranging co-operation, {{but it was}} more focused on the {{exchange}} of information and defence planning for the Åland islands than on military exercises or materiel. The Finnish objective was to commit the Swedes by establishing a military-political joint venture in the Åland: if the Swedes would undertake to assist Finland in fortifying the islands, then <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> useful precedent might be set. The Government of Sweden was aware of the military co-operation, but carefully avoided committing itself to Finnish foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|The chased hare {{will then}} run at around 40–45km/h (24–26mph) {{and the course}} will last around 35–40seconds over 0.5km (0.3 miles). The greyhounds which pursue the hare will, being faster, start {{to catch up with}} it. As greyhounds are much larger than hares but less agile, they find it {{difficult}} to follow the hares' sharp turns which they make to evade the dogs. This agility gives the hare <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> often crucial advantage as it seeks to escape. Under some coursing club rules, the dogs are awarded points on how many times they can turn the hare, and how closely they force the hare's progress. In the UK, the contest between the greyhounds was usually judged from horseback, and the winning greyhound proceeded to the next round of a knock-out tournament. The 2003 UK coursing season ran from 1 October to 28 February.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of human settlement at Little Thetford since the Neolithic Age. A 1996 search along the Anglian Water pipeline at Little Thetford—Cawdle Fen uncovered <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> unusually dense concentration of late Neolithic (3000–2201BC) remains. This is unusual because, although the fenland basin was dry and forested during the Mesolithic era, the area was sometimes subject to marine incursions, and at other times, fresh-water flooding. This led to marshes and open water areas {{which may have been}} difficult to settle on—except perhaps for seasonal activity. A Neolithic polished flint axe (4000–2201BC) was found in the village in 1984 at Bedwell Hey Farm. Fourteen pre-Roman flints of various finishes were also discovered in 1998 at the same site.|$|E

5|$|Townshend came up {{with the}} concept of Tommy after being {{introduced}} to the work of Meher Baba, and attempted to translate Baba's teachings into music. Recording on the album began in September 1968, but took six months to complete as material needed to be arranged and re-recorded in the studio. Tommy was acclaimed upon its release by critics, who hailed it as the Who's breakthrough. Its critical standing diminished slightly in later years; nonetheless, several writers view it as <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> influential album in the history of rock music. The Who promoted the album's release with an extensive tour, including a live version of Tommy, which lasted throughout 1969 and 1970. Key gigs from the tour included appearances at Woodstock, the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival, the University of Leeds, the Metropolitan Opera House and the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival. The live performances of Tommy drew critical praise and rejuvenated the band's career.|$|E
