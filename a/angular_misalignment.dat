40|$|The {{quality of}} {{dimensional}} measurements made by industrial X-ray computed tomography (CT) {{depends on a}} variety of influence factors in the measurement process. In this paper, the effects of <b>angular</b> <b>misalignments</b> of a flat-panel detector are investigated. First, a forward projection model is applied to evaluate distortions of the radiographic pixel coordinates assigned to X-ray intensities due to various detector rotation angles. Distortion maps are presented for a set of representative detector rotations and the sensitivity of image distortions to each rotation is discussed. It is shown from a simulation study that detector <b>angular</b> <b>misalignments</b> result in systematic errors of the reconstructed volume. The distortion model is inversely applied to generate correction maps that are used to correct the simulated radiographs from a misaligned detector. A new volume is reconstructed from the corrected radiographs and the new deviations are compared to the uncorrected results. The reduction of observed volumetric errors after radiographic correction validates the efficacy of the radiographic distortion model. Additionally, the output of this study can {{contribute to the development of}} a geometrical error model for volumetric measurements made by CT. status: publishe...|$|R

Gear couplings have higher torque densities than universal joints designed to fit a given space while universal joints induce lower vibrations.

50|$|CARB {{bearings}} are toroidal {{roller bearings}} and similar to spherical roller bearings, but can accommodate both <b>angular</b> <b>misalignment</b> and also axial displacement. Compared to a spherical roller bearing, their {{radius of curvature}} is longer than a spherical radius would be, making them an intermediate form between spherical and cylindrical rollers. Their limitation is that, like a cylindrical roller, they do not locate axially. CARB bearings are typically used in pairs with a locating bearing, such as a spherical roller bearing. This non-locating bearing can be an advantage, {{as it can be}} used to allow a shaft and a housing to undergo thermal expansion independently.|$|E
50|$|A beam coupling, {{also known}} as helical coupling, is a {{flexible}} coupling for transmitting torque between two shafts while allowing for <b>angular</b> <b>misalignment,</b> parallel offset and even axial motion, of one shaft relative to the other. This design utilizes {{a single piece of}} material and becomes flexible by removal of material along a spiral path resulting in a curved flexible beam of helical shape. Since it is made from a single piece of material, the Beam Style coupling does not exhibit the backlash found in some multi-piece couplings. Another advantage of being an all machined coupling is the possibility to incorporate features into the final product while still keep the single piece integrity.|$|E

In the case of extra-cavity implementations, we show several practical layouts of anamorphic optical systems (AOSs) for shaping the propagation-invariant laser beams based on the size and waist locations of the input laser beams.

50|$|Self-aligning ball bearings, {{such as the}} Wingquist bearing {{shown in}} the picture, are {{constructed}} with the inner ring and ball assembly contained within an outer ring that has a spherical raceway. This construction allows the bearing to tolerate a small <b>angular</b> <b>misalignment</b> resulting from shaft or housing deflections or improper mounting. The bearing was used mainly in bearing arrangements with very long shafts, such as transmission shafts in textile factories.One drawback of the self-aligning ball bearings is a limited load rating, as the outer raceway has very low osculation (radius is much larger than ball radius). This led to {{the invention of the}} spherical roller bearing, which has a similar design, but use rollers instead of balls. Also the spherical roller thrust bearing is an invention that derives from the findings by Wingquist.|$|E
5000|$|The method {{consists}} in a measurement of an alleged <b>angular</b> <b>misalignment</b> (referred to as associated phoria or hidden strabismus, also called [...] "" [...] in German language) {{that is different}} from heterotropia or heterophoria, and involves the use of prisms for its correction. In the MKH method, this alleged misalignment is assessed by the Polatest apparatus and subsequently the patient is instructed to use prism glasses in daily life to correct for the alleged misalignment, with the prism glasses made according to the Polatest results. The MKH method claims to reduce eye strain-related symptoms. It has found some application in German-speaking countries and claims to achieve unimpaired binocular vision, however it has received little scientific recognition and is not accepted by mainstream medical practice, neither internationally nor in Germany. The method does not appear to show better results than conventional spectacle prescriptions, and the practice of MKH has been criticized as contravening the rule to first do no harm. The German association of ophthalmologists ( [...] (BVA)) issued a statement warning that the use of the MKH method could in fact lead to use of prisms of increasing strength, ultimately requiring the patient to undergo strabismus surgery that would have otherwise been unnecessary.|$|E
50|$|Docking {{occurred}} at 9 am EDT, 29 June, using R-Bar or Earth radius vector approach, with Atlantis {{closing in on}} Mir from directly below. R-bar approach allows natural forces to brake the orbiters approach more than would occur along standard approach {{directly in front of}} the space station; also, an R-bar approach minimizes the number of orbiter jet firings needed for approach. The manual phase of the docking began with Atlantis about a half-mile (800 m) below Mir, with Gibson at the controls on aft flight deck. Stationkeeping was performed when the orbiter was about 75 m from Mir, pending approval from Russian and U.S. flight directors to proceed. Gibson then maneuvered the orbiter to a point about 10 m from Mir before beginning the final approach to station. Closing rate was close to the targeted 0.1 foot per second (30 mm/s), being approximately 0.107 foot per second (33 mm/s) at contact. Interface contact was nearly flawless: less than 25 mm lateral misalignment and an <b>angular</b> <b>misalignment</b> of less than 0.5 degrees per axis. Docking occurred about 216 nautical miles (400 km) above Lake Baikal region of the Russian Federation. The Orbiter Docking System (ODS) with Androgynous Peripheral Docking System served as the actual connection point to a similar interface on the docking port on Mirs Kristall module. ODS, located in the forward payload bay of Atlantis, performed flawlessly during the docking sequence.|$|E
