5000|$|Head alignment. This was {{an issue}} for two reasons: a) Azimuth {{misalignment}} results in reduced high frequencies, and b) Head height misalignment allows sounds from adjacent tracks to bleed over, an effect sometimes known as [...] "double-tracking". This {{is due to the}} resultant time delay between the left and right channels resulting in a degradation of phase correlation. This effect is enhanced in an 8-track system, as compared to either reel-to-reel or cassette, due to the larger physical distance, on the tape, between the left and right channel tracks. Resetting head height and azimuth is a primary service procedure required, when refurbishing any vintage tape deck. Once set the player will perform accurately. This format, unlike other tape formats, features a movable head with four positions. Among audio service technicians, {{there used to be a}} joke that [...] "the eight-track is the only audio device which knocks itself out of alignment four times during each album." [...] When tracking/azimuth is set using a high quality (ex: Columbia) or <b>alignment</b> <b>tape,</b> correct operation will be restored. Some brands of 8-track decks had adjustable tape head thumbwheel knobs on the front panel, so the listener could adjust the tracking, much like a VHS or Beta tape was adjusted for picture quality. The listener could then adjust the tape head individually for each tape, avoiding double tracking.|$|E

40|$|The {{automatic}} {{extraction of}} acronyms and their meaning from corpora {{is an important}} sub-task of text mining. It {{can be seen as}} a special case of string alignment, where a text chunk is aligned with an acronym. Alternative alignments have different cost, and ideally the least costly one should give the correct meaning of the acronym. We show how this approach can be implemented by means of a 3 -tape weighted finitestate machine (3 -WFSM) which reads a text chunk on tape 1 and an acronym on tape 2, and generates all alternative <b>alignments</b> on <b>tape</b> 3. The 3 -WFSM can be automatically generated from a simple regular expression. No additional algorithms are required at any stage. Our 3 -WFSM has a size of 27 states and 64 transitions, and finds the best analysis of an acronym in a few milliseconds. ...|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{precursor}} powders {{are packed}} into a silver tube which is extruded down in diameter. These are then repacked as multiple tubes {{in a silver}} tube and again extruded down in diameter, then drawn down further in size and rolled into a flat tape. The last step ensures grain <b>alignment.</b> The <b>tapes</b> are then reacted at high temperature to form dense, crystallographically aligned Bi-2223 multifilamentary conducting tape suitable for winding cables or coils for transformers, magnets, motors and generators. Typical tapes of 4 mm width and 0.2 mm thickness support a current at 77 K of 200 A, giving a critical current density (maximal amperes per square metre of cross-sectional area) in the Bi-2223 filaments of 5×105 A/cm2. This rises markedly with decreasing temperature so that many applications are implemented at 30-35 K, even though Tc is 108 K.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMisalignment angles in {{multifilament}} Bi 2212 tapes {{have been}} Studied by transport current density (J(c)) measurements. Transversal misalignment angles {{depend on the}} filaments thickness due to the crystal growth along the Bi 2212 /silver interface. Therefore, the thinner the filaments, the higher the J(c). A dynamic thermal treatment improves grain <b>alignment</b> inside the <b>tapes</b> due to preferential crystal growth along the thermal gradient direction. Furthermore, melting in high magnetic field reduces the misaligninent angle due to magnetic anisotropy effects. Therefore, good transport J(c) performances can be expected for thicker multifilament Bi 2212 tapes prepared {{using a combination of}} the dynamic process and melting in a high magnetic field...|$|R

Orientation degree of tape cast with 1 st blade set of 0. 3 mm at a constant speed of 2. 5 cm/min was found in a range of 4 - 8 %. However, the observed particle alignment was slightly different from the upper surface, which particles aligned parallel to casting direction, but on Mylar contacted surface, particles relatively inclined to the surface. 1...|$|R
40|$|Melt {{infiltration}} of preforms prepared by tape casting and lamination {{has been accomplished}} using a short-time infiltration process that significantly suppresses reaction product formation. For layered materials produced via {{infiltration of}} laminated ceramic tapes, of particular interest is the effect that a large change in microstructure has on infiltration, phase formation, and mechanical properties. Hardness of the fine scale composite layers is approximately three times higher than coarse scale layers, due to greater strength of the fine B 4 C network. Fractography showed that crack propagation occurred by brittle fracture of the carbide and ductile extension of the metal. Despite large differences in hardness, the fracture mode of the fine and coarse scale microstructures appears identical. ^ Fluid flow modeling for tape casting was conducted with a Newtonian slurry under a parallel blade, {{and the effect of}} beveling the blade based on a one dimensional flow model is shown. The discussion on slurry deformation after the blade exit suggests that the mode of slurry deformation depends on the relative importance of the pressure gradient and wall shear and that the existence of zero shear plane might {{have a negative effect on}} particle <b>alignment</b> in the <b>tape.</b> The analysis of the flow under a beveled blade predicts that this configuration is more advantageous than the parallel blade for productivity and parallel blade is better for producing uniform particle <b>alignment</b> and thinner <b>tape.</b> Also, the one dimensional flow model for the beveled blade is shown to be a valid approximation of the fluid behavior below a blade angle of 45 degrees. ^ The flow visualization study on tape casting was conducted with a transparent apparatus and model slurry. Most investigators have concluded that the shear stress between the doctor blade and moving carrier causes the particle alignment, but, according to the result of visualization experiment, some degree of particle alignment is already established in the reservoir. ^ The fluid flow concept of tape casting is incorporated with a metal infiltration technique to prepare the ceramic-metal composites with tailored porosity and pore orientation. Boron carbide-aluminum system was used to prepare the composites, and its stiffness constants were investigated. The aligned metal ligaments rarely affect the stiffness constant anisotropy which appears to be caused by tape casting operation. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{series of}} eight symmetrically {{substituted}} diketopiperazines (DKPs) derived from 1 -amino- 1 -carboxycycloalkanes (n = 3 − 7; 3, 3, 5, 5 -tetramethylcyclohexane; 4, 4 -dimethylcyclohexane; 2 -indan) were synthesized and their crystal structures determined. In the solid state, all eight compounds form {{two pairs of}} hydrogen bonds with two adjacent molecules to form a one-dimensional structure that we refer to as "tapes". These molecules represent a range of volumes and shapes that contain a common molecular fragment (DKP ring). We examined this series of compounds with three objectives in mind: (i) to establish {{the ability of the}} hydrogen-bonded "tape" motif to persist through these differences in volume and shape; (ii) to provide a series of structurally related compounds to use to test computational methods of predicting crystal structure from molecular structure; (iii) to search for qualitative correlations between molecular structure and crystal packing. All compounds form tapes and with one exception, all tapes pack with their long axes parallel. When viewed down their long axis, two types of tapes emerge: planar and nonplanar. The type of tape that forms reflects the conformation adapted by the DKP ringplanar or boat. Planar tapes form when the angle (α) between the two planes defined by the cis-amides in the DKP ring is 180 °; nonplanar tapes form when α < 180 °. Five of the eight compounds studied form planar tapes, the remaining three compounds form nonplanar tapes. Despite the variability in volume and shape represented by this series of molecules, the persistence of the tape motif in their crystalline solids suggests that the hydrogen-bonding interactions between DKPs dominate the packing arrangement of these molecules. Void space in the crystalline solid is minimized by parallel <b>alignment</b> of <b>tapes</b> that pack in a manner that permits the interdigitation of substituents on adjacent tapes...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To {{conduct a}} {{systematic}} review comparing {{the effects of}} Kinesio taping with McConnell taping {{as a method of}} conservative management of patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). Methods. MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, AMED, and the Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials electronic databases were searched through July 2014. Controlled studies evaluating the effects of Kinesio or McConnell taping in PFPS patients were retrieved. Results. Ninety-one articles were selected from the articles that were retrieved from the databases, and 11 articles were included in the analysis. The methods, evaluations, and results of the articles were collected, and the outcomes of patellar tapings were analyzed. Kinesio taping can reduce pain and increase the muscular flexibility of PFPS patients, and McConnell taping also had effect in pain relief and patellar alignment. Meta-analysis showed small effect in pain reduction and motor function improvement and moderate effect in muscle activity change among PFPS patients using Kinesio taping. Conclusions. Kinesio taping technique used for muscles can relieve pain but cannot change patellar <b>alignment,</b> unlike McConnell <b>taping.</b> Both patellar tapings are used differently for PFPS patients and substantially improve muscle activity, motor function, and quality of life...|$|R
