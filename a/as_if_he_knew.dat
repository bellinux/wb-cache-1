5|$|As Emma {{arrives at}} Granny's Bed & Breakfast, she {{is given a}} key to her room by the elderly {{proprietor}} (Beverley Elliot), who is actually Granny from Little Red Riding Hood. She comes downstairs after yelling at Ruby (Meghan Ory), her granddaughter, followed {{by a man who}} came to collect money: Mr. Gold (Carlyle), Rumpelstiltskin who also helped build and owns the entire town. When Emma mentions her name, Mr. Gold pauses <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> something about her. Emma's decision to stay in Storybrooke causes the hands of the town clock, previously frozen at 8:15, to begin moving again, indicating that the Dark Curse is beginning to weaken.|$|E
25|$|It {{is presumed}} {{that he was}} {{disposing}} of his belongings throughout the town of Sligo and then folding the bag and putting it in his pocket. Authorities were unable to identify what he was throwing away in the public rubbish bins as the man used the blind spots of the surveillance cameras to his advantage. His movements were very meticulous and methodical <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> where to hide his personal belongings that could have identified him.|$|E
25|$|This last {{discrepancy}} may {{be explained}} as Dalin wanting {{to talk to his}} father but not wanting to open the emotional floodgates of a reunion that both want but seem unable to take the first step towards. Instead Dalin asks Kolea about his parents, and Kolea replies <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> them well. On Games Day Germany in 2009 Abnett clarified this discrepancy being caused by the psychic influence of Agun Soric, which meddled with the character's thinking, and made Dalin forget the revealed identity of his father.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{do it to}} flatter," [...] ses old Sam, looking <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>’e</b> <b>knew</b> {{all about}} it. [...] "You wait till you are my age, Joe; then you’ll know; why I should ha’ been married dozens o’ times if I ’adn’t been careful." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{his review}} of the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic wrote that the song [...] "stumbles in its {{attempts}} at seduction." [...] Robert Loy of Country Standard Time was more positive, saying that [...] "for such a young man, <b>he</b> certainly sounds <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> of whence <b>he</b> sings." ...|$|R
60|$|Ladywell looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{sometimes}} <b>knew</b> secrets, though <b>he</b> did {{not wish}} to boast.|$|R
500|$|In {{the album}} notes to , Joshua Rifkin {{describes}} the [...] "Magnetic Rag" [...] as a [...] "valedictory work" [...] with Joplin paying [...] "tribute" [...] to a [...] "transplanted Middle-European dance music" [...] and the European masters whom {{he tried to}} emulate. Rifkin speculates that the composition's short coda also [...] "seems like a farewell, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> how brief and bleak was the time still alloted him." [...] In 1979 Alan Rich in the New York Magazine wrote that by giving artists like Rifkin the opportunity to put Joplin's music on record Nonesuch Records [...] "created, almost alone, the Scott Joplin revival." ...|$|E
500|$|Kennedy's wife Ethel {{stood outside}} the crush {{of people at the}} scene, seeking help. She was soon led to her husband and knelt beside him. He turned his head and seemed to {{recognize}} her. Smith promptly appeared on television and calmly asked for a doctor. Friend and journalist Pete Hamill recalled that Kennedy, as he lay dying, had [...] "a kind of sweet accepting smile on his face, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it would all end this way". After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, [...] "Don't lift me..." [...] which were to become his last words. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter. Kennedy was taken a mile away to Central Receiving Hospital, where he arrived near death. One doctor slapped his face, calling, [...] "Bob, Bob", while another doctor manually massaged Kennedy's heart. After obtaining a good heartbeat, doctors handed a stethoscope to Ethel so she could hear her husband's heart beating, much to her relief.|$|E
2500|$|Azim-us-Shan was {{extremely}} worried Quli Khan knew of his assassination plans and was fearful of Aurangzeb's reaction. Quli Khan behaved <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> {{nothing of the}} plan assuring us-Shan they would remain friends in the future. However, he wrote about the matter to Aurangzeb, who in turn {{sent a letter to}} us-Shan warning him that if Quli Khan was [...] "harmed, then he would take revenge on him".|$|E
3000|$|... “The gentle {{soul of the}} teacher, {{his ability}} to convey {{information}} to me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> me for years. Although I have taken similar classes before it wasn’t until now…that I grasped the mindfulness meaning. For me {{is the first step}} to beginning to love myself, something I have been trying for over 50 yrs”.|$|R
60|$|Schomberg made {{a gesture}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't <b>know,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't care. Then he squared his {{shoulders}} and frowned at vacancy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ears are {{sharp as}} a dog's. Callate he kin hear {{as far as the}} governor's table, and <b>he</b> don't look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> anything. One way he built up his power--listenin' when they're talkin' sly out there in the rotunda. They're almighty {{surprised}} when they l'arn <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> what they're up to. Guess you understand how to go along by quiet and listen when they're talkin' sly." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{turned toward}} her with a smile of gratification, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> she had {{detected}} {{something out of the}} ordinary in him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am happy}} to hear it," [...] {{answered}} Albany, with a countenance of pity and incredulity, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> nothing of the supposed services.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take off his helmet, Ralph. Let me see his face. Methinks I {{recognized}} his voice, and he fought <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> and hated me." ...|$|E
60|$|John Willet {{looked at}} another man, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't <b>know</b> {{which was the}} speaker, and muttered {{something}} about an ordinary every Sunday at two o'clock.|$|R
60|$|Marvel did not reply, but {{greeted the}} king quietly, while Terribus welcomed their return <b>as</b> calmly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> well <b>knew</b> {{they could not}} escape him.|$|R
50|$|When Rex {{returns from}} Málaga, he first runs into Stephen, who talks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> what's {{going on with}} their scam without {{actually}} saying it. As such, Rex later tells Stella that their new plan, with no more scams, is to ditch Stephen by leaving {{first thing in the}} morning before he awakens, and cross the border into Gibraltar. Relieved that there will be no more scams, Stella does not tell Rex what she has found out about Stephen.|$|R
6000|$|Whittle turned, and {{ran back}} a few steps. [...] "Yes, sir," [...] he said, in breathless deprecation, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> what was coming next.|$|E
6000|$|... "He shall; but I misdoubt {{the fellow}} very much. He talks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> Latin; and what {{business}} has a foot-running slave to do that?" ...|$|E
60|$|The excited boy obeyed, and Dumps, leaping {{on another}} chair beside him, {{sat down to}} listen, with ears erect, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> what was coming.|$|E
5000|$|Grandpa Wetworth (voiced by Frank Welker) - An orange-skinned Snork. He's Junior and Willie's {{grandfather}} and Wellington Wetworth's father. Grandpa Wetworth {{is a smart}} trickster that acts <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> less than what he does. He's an elderly male that is young at heart and in spirit, {{as well as being}} technologically savvy. Junior always tries to surpass him in tricks but Grandpa Wetworth is always one step ahead. He's liked by all and likes Allstar and his friends.|$|R
60|$|My sister {{looked at}} Pumblechook: who {{smoothed}} the elbows of his wooden arm-chair, and nodded {{at her and}} at the fire, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had <b>known</b> all about it beforehand.|$|R
60|$|Peter {{scratched}} one {{ear with}} a long hind foot and hesitated <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't <b>know</b> just how to begin. Old Mother Nature waited patiently. Finally Peter began rather timidly.|$|R
60|$|Towser {{was an old}} and {{faithful}} animal, a prime favorite with Jerry, and he trotted along beside the horse <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> something was wrong.|$|E
60|$|James stirred uneasily, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> {{what they}} were saying. Soames rose and bent over him. James feebly moved his two hands, and Soames took them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, sir, if {{all were}} ready!" [...] {{repeated}} Mr. Leach, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> how much honest labour {{was to be}} expended before that happy moment could arrive.|$|E
6000|$|... "Acts <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had <b>known</b> us all our lives," [...] said Dick. [...] "He is {{certainly}} a fine creature, or he will be after he is fed up a bit." ...|$|R
50|$|This left Mr P in a {{frustrating}} position, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had <b>known</b> {{that the original}} separation agreement was still enforceable, he could have applied to the court to have it set aside.|$|R
60|$|Agatha {{was silent}} for some moments because she was {{surprised}} and moved. George had a keener imagination and saw farther than she thought. It looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had <b>known</b> her mother best.|$|R
6000|$|... "There was Norman {{grave and}} steadfast, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> {{what he was}} about, and was manfully and calmly ready--he {{might have been a}} young knight, {{watching}} his armour." ...|$|E
60|$|Then he stalked {{off through}} the crowd <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that men who slunk from facing him would not have nerve enough to attack him even from behind.|$|E
6000|$|Cristel {{dropped his}} book on the table, and hurried to me in breathless surprise. [...] "He speaks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> you!" [...] she cried. [...] "What does it mean?" ...|$|E
60|$|For just {{a second}} Happy Jack didn't <b>know</b> what <b>he</b> meant. Then he saw Farmer Brown's boy {{watching}} Tommy Tit <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't <b>know</b> {{what to make of}} the little fellow's excitement.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, fortunately, {{we are not}} {{required}} now; we are required for something else." [...] And Miss Birdseye {{looked at him with}} a wandering, tentative humour, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would <b>know</b> what she meant.|$|R
25|$|The naturalism of {{the figures}} {{suggests}} the artist's intention to elicit an immediate emotional response to the viewer. Neptune’s furrowed brow gives a sense of his fierce strength. His stance is set in stone, solidifying his divine power. In contrast, Triton looks somewhat submissive while he is grabbing Neptune’s thigh. His face looks {{to be full of}} anxiety <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that <b>he</b> should obey whatever Neptune commands him to do. His timid nature and Neptune’s dominate presence display the reality of human emotion and brings back the point of Bernini’s plan to convey myths coming to life.|$|R
