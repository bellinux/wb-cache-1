5|$|In the {{circumstances}} {{it was hardly}} possible for the new king to show adaptability or tolerance or diplomatic skill, which are the fruit of long experience in human relationships. Confronted with a desperate and chaotic situation he met it instead with grim determination and implacable ferocity. Towards {{the end of his}} life, forfeiting the affection and loyalty even of his courtiers and family he became a lonely figure, isolated by suspicion <b>and</b> <b>mistrust.</b> But, in spite of all, the name of this great defender of the faith {{is one of the most}} memorable in Ethiopian history.|$|E
5|$|The postwar climate sees {{a period}} of {{austerity}} <b>and</b> <b>mistrust</b> towards the machines. Returning from {{the horrors of the}} war, Marke becomes the Consul of Berlin and instates a reign of isolation and deurbanization. Advanced weapons are destroyed, people are driven out into the countryside to cultivate the land, and the giant energy accumulators are destroyed. Columns made to look like bulls are erected in city squares and at crossroads, and roar twice a day like a dying animal to remind people of the catastrophe of the Ural War. Marduk succeeds Marke as the Consul and continues the period of brutal authoritarian rule.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} claimed lineage {{from the}} non-monastic {{branch of the}} Filitti clan. A Silvestru Filitti, active ca. 1810, {{was among the first}} private practitioners in Wallachia. Fully Romanianized, 20th-century Filittis were still members of Romania's privileged class. A native of Bucharest, Ioan C. was the son of Colonel Constantin Filitti, a former Ordinance Officer of the Romanian Domnitori. By then, the family owned a country estate, at Alexeni, Ialomița County. The Filittis preserved strong connections with the Ialomița region, where Colonel Filitti had twice served as Prefect. Ioan inherited from him a deep dislike <b>and</b> <b>mistrust</b> toward the dominant National Liberal Party (PNL), sentiments which carried him into Conservative politics: Constantin regarded himself as a political victim of the PNL establishment, and in particular of the Brătianu family. Colonel Filitti had another son, Alexandru—better known under the moniker Filitti-Robănești.|$|E

5|$|After his succession, Charles quarrelled {{with the}} Parliament of England, {{which sought to}} curb his royal prerogative. Charles {{believed}} in the divine right of kings and thought he could govern according to his own conscience. Many of his subjects opposed his policies, in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent, and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical absolute monarch. His religious policies, coupled with his marriage to a Roman Catholic, generated the antipathy <b>and</b> <b>mistrust</b> of reformed {{groups such as the}} English Puritans and Scottish Covenanters, who thought his views too Catholic. He supported high church ecclesiastics, such as Richard Montagu and William Laud, and failed to aid Protestant forces successfully during the Thirty Years' War. His attempts to force the Church of Scotland to adopt high Anglican practices led to the Bishops' Wars, strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments and helped precipitate his own downfall.|$|E
5|$|William's {{successor}} was Mary's sister Princess Anne, {{who had no}} surviving {{children and}} so the Protestant succession seemed in doubt. The English Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which fixed the succession on Sophia of Hanover and her descendants. However, the Scottish Parliament's parallel Act of Security, merely prohibited a Roman Catholic successor, leaving {{open the possibility that}} the crowns would diverge. Rather than risk the possible return of James Francis Edward Stuart, then living in France, the English parliament pressed for full union of the two countries, passing the Alien Act 1705, which threatened to make all Scotsmen unable to hold property in England unless moves toward union were made and would have severely damaged the cattle and linen trades. A political union between Scotland and England also became economically attractive, promising to open up the much larger markets of England, {{as well as those of}} the growing Empire. However, there was widespread, if disunited opposition <b>and</b> <b>mistrust</b> in the general population. Sums paid to Scottish commissioners and leading political figure have been described as bribes, but the existence of direct bribes is disputed.|$|E

25|$|Anti-intellectualism is {{hostility to}} <b>and</b> <b>mistrust</b> of intellect, intellectuals, and intellectualism {{commonly}} expressed as deprecation {{of education and}} philosophy, and the dismissal of art, literature, and science as impractical and even contemptible human pursuits. Anti-intellectuals present themselves and are perceived as champions of common folk—populists against political and academic elitism. They tend to see educated people as a status class detached from the concerns of most people, and feel that intellectuals dominate political discourse and control higher education.|$|E

25|$|On 30 October Amir, {{along with}} Sukarno and Hatta, was flown into the East Java city of Surabaya by the desperate British {{caretaker}} administration. The three {{were seen as}} the only Indonesian leaders likely able to quell fighting between Republican and British Indian forces in which the British Brigade were hopelessly outnumbered and facing annihilation. A ceasefire was immediately adhered to, but fighting soon recommenced after confused communications <b>and</b> <b>mistrust</b> between the two sides, leading to the famed Battle of Surabaya.|$|E
25|$|The British {{began to}} doubt Admiral Darlan's promise to Churchill to {{not allow the}} French fleet at Toulon to fall into German hands by {{the wording of the}} {{armistice}} conditions. In the end, the British attacked French naval forces in Africa and Europe killing 1000 French soldiers at Mers El Kebir alone. This action led to feelings of animosity <b>and</b> <b>mistrust</b> between the Vichy French and their former British allies. During the course of the war, Vichy France forces lost 2,653 soldiers and Free France lost 20,000.|$|E
25|$|History records how the Philippine–American War {{began after}} American troops killed a Filipino soldier who was {{crossing}} the San Juan bridge on February 4, 1899. One could also say however that hostilities <b>and</b> <b>mistrust</b> really began {{as early as}} August 13 the previous year. On that day, the Spanish colonial government in Intramuros surrendered to American forces instead of the Filipino soldiers that surrounded the Walled City. Thus began the United States own effort to have her own colonies, with the Philippines served, as it were, on a silver platter by the dying Spanish Empire thanks to the Treaty of Paris.|$|E

25|$|Turkey, only 75km away, had {{repeatedly}} claimed, for decades {{before the invasion}} and frequently afterwards, that Cyprus was of vital strategic importance to it. Ankara has defied a host of UN resolutions demanding the withdrawal of its occupation troops from the island. About 142,000 Greek Cypriots living in the north – nearly {{one quarter of the}} population of Cyprus – were forcibly expelled from the occupied northern part of the island where they constituted 80% of the population. These people are still deprived of the right {{to return to their homes}} and properties. U.S. Congress imposed an embargo on arms sales to Turkey leading to excessive tension <b>and</b> <b>mistrust</b> between Turkey and the United States.|$|E
25|$|In 1909–10, {{football}} faced {{a crisis}} {{resulting from the}} failure of the previous reforms of 1905–06 {{to solve the problem of}} serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm <b>and</b> <b>mistrust,</b> and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. President Arthur Hadley of Yale, A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and Woodrow Wilson of Princeton worked to develop moderate changes to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association. The big three had tried to operate independently of the majority, but changes did reduce injuries.|$|E
25|$|While Dutch {{society has}} a history of support for liberal values, it has not been immune to what can be {{regarded}} as a broader international trend toward the practice of racial profiling and increased levels of police violence towards racial minorities. Suspicion <b>and</b> <b>mistrust</b> of some racial groups is evident, and is perpetuated by police attitudes at all levels of command. This trend in police behaviour has drawn comment from Amnesty International, which in a 2015 report describes Dutch law enforcement officers as having a tendency to correlate suspicious criminal behaviour with specific ethnic characteristics, most notably those typical of persons of Moroccan heritage. Current political discourse in the Netherlands often supports the notion of inferiority of some cultures and is evidenced by the growth in support for far right political ideologies in recent decades.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, The Thing was {{released}} as a survival horror third-person shooter for PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, {{acting as a}} sequel to the film. The video game differs from the comics in that Childs is dead of exposure, and the audiotapes are present (they were removed from Outpost 31 {{at the start of}} The Thing from Another World: Questionable Research). At the completion of the game, R.J. MacReady is found alive and helping the main character complete the last mission. The game used elements of paranoia <b>and</b> <b>mistrust</b> intrinsic to the film. Some retailers, such as GameStop, offered a free copy of the 1998 DVD release as an incentive for reserving the game. In 2011, a region of the Entropia Universe was created based on the theme of The Thing.|$|E
25|$|Nariakira {{did not see}} eye to {{eye with}} his father, Shimazu Narioki, or his father’s chief advisor, Zusho Hirosato. Both Narioki and Zusho were wary of the Tokugawa shogunate. Zusho also saw many {{similarities}} in Nariakira and his grandfather, Shigehide. Shigehide also had a great interest in Dutch studies as well as scientific and industrial projects, which promptly led to the deterioration of the domain’s financial position. Having worked so hard to rehabilitate and strengthen the treasury of Satsuma, Zusho did not encourage Nariakira’s ambitious and costly program for a military build-up. Narioki and Zusho’s mutual disdain <b>and</b> <b>mistrust</b> for Nariakira led to their endeavoring to isolate Nariakira from Satsuma’s affairs, which entailed withholding or all together ceasing the flow from all sources of information regarding Satsuma’s officials or their dealings with the shogunate.|$|E
25|$|In April 1759 Frederick led {{his main}} army from Saxony into Lower Silesia {{to keep the}} Russian army in western Poland–Lithuania {{separated}} from Daun's Austrians in Bohemia. Meanwhile, a smaller Prussian force under Prince Henry remained in Saxony to harass Bohemia through the Ore Mountains, winning the Battle of Peterswalde {{and a series of}} other minor engagements, as well as destroying several Austrian ammunition dumps and bridges before retreating into Saxony. The Russians continued to press into Neumark; on 23 July the Russian Count Saltykov led 47,000 men in defeating 26,000 Prussians commanded by General Carl Heinrich von Wedel at the Battle of Kay. However, poor coordination <b>and</b> <b>mistrust</b> between the Russians and Austrians prevented Saltykov and Daun's forces from uniting after the victory. Still, the Russians advanced westward, and on 3 August they reached and occupied Frankfurt an der Oder, where they received some Austrian reinforcements under General Ernst von Laudon.|$|E
