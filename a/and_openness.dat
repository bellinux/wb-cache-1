The original play is again a stage favourite today, and is also acclaimed by academic critics, who praise its linguistic energy, sharp social satire, <b>and</b> <b>openness</b> to different interpretations.|$|E
5|$|The French {{government}} installed Rainilaiarivony in the Geryville {{neighborhood of}} Algiers, {{one of the}} derelict parts of town. He was assigned a French attendant and guard named Joseph Vassé, who maintained detailed documentation on the personality and activities of Rainilaiarivony throughout his exile in French Algeria. Vassé described {{the former prime minister}} as a man of great spontaneity, sincere friendliness, <b>and</b> <b>openness</b> of heart, but also prone to mood swings, touchiness, and a tendency to be demanding, especially in regard to his particular tastes in clothing. His intelligence, tact and leadership qualities won him the admiration of many who knew him, including Le Myre des Vilers, who referred to him as both an enemy and a friend. Upon learning of Rainilaiarivony's living situation in Algiers, Le Myre de Vilers privately lobbied the French government for better accommodation. Consequently, Vassé found a new home for the former Prime Minister at the elegant estate called Villa des Fleurs ("Villa of the Flowers") in the upscale Mustapha Supérieur neighborhood, neighboring the residence of the exiled former king of Annam.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the relationship between trade <b>and</b> financial <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> economic growth in Turkey. For this purpose for the period of 1990 : 1 - 2006 : 4, the relationships between trade <b>and</b> financial <b>openness</b> rates <b>and</b> real economic growth rate are analyzed econometrically by employing multivariate cointegration analysis, error correction-augmented Granger causality tests and vector error correction model. According to the results, economic growth is positively effected by trade <b>openness,</b> <b>and</b> negatively by financial openness in the long run. Error correction-augmented Granger causality tests show that there is bi-directional causality between trade <b>and</b> financial <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> economic growth. Furthermore, it is observed that one-directional causality exists from trade openness to financial openness.

40|$|This paper aims at {{investigating}} the linkages among financial development, financial <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> trade <b>openness</b> in twenty-nine Asian developing countries {{over the period}} 1994 - 2008.

The first one supports an evidence of bidirectional causality between trade <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> financial development/openness.

The second one suggests that the relationship between financial development <b>and</b> financial <b>openness</b> is heterogeneous, as well as its variation across different measures.

In PEMFCs, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the Pt cathode is significantly slower than the fuel oxidation reaction at the anode, and thus non-PGM and metal-free catalysts are being investigated as alternatives. The high volumetric density, large pore surface areas, <b>and</b> <b>openness</b> of metal-ion sites in MOFs make them ideal candidates for catalyst precursors. Despite promising catalytic abilities, the durability of these proposed MOF-based catalysts is currently less than desirable and the ORR mechanism in this context is still not completely understood.|$|E

Findings from numerous personality studies show that genetics account for 20-48% of the variance in Five-Factor Model and the variance in subjective well-being is also heritable. Specifically, neuroticism predicts poorer subjective well-being whilst extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness <b>and</b> <b>openness</b> to experience tend to predict higher subjective well-being. A meta-analysis found that neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were significantly related to all facets of SWB examined (positive, negative, and overall affect; happiness; life satisfaction; and quality of life). Neuroticism was the strongest predictor of overall SWB and is the strongest predictor of negative affect.|$|E
