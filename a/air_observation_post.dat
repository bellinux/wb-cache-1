25|$|RAF Andover has {{a unique}} place in British history, as the first British {{military}} unit to be equipped with helicopters, the Helicopter Training School, was formed in January 1945 at RAF Andover {{under the command of}} Squadron Leader B.H. Arkell. This was also the first European helicopter flying-training school, however the first European military unit formed solely with helicopters was the Luftwaffe's Transportstaffel 40 in 1944. The Helicopter Training School was equipped with nine Sikorsky R-4B Hoverfly I helicopters, and trained 100 British Army pilots for <b>Air</b> <b>Observation</b> <b>Post</b> duties, as well as pilots for the first RAF squadron to be equipped with helicopters, 529 Squadron, which carried our radar calibration duties. Radar calibration duties were later carried out by the Hawker Siddeley Andover and <b>Air</b> <b>Observation</b> <b>Post</b> duties are today carried out by the Army Air Corps.|$|E
50|$|Some of the RAF {{examples}} were {{allotted to}} 657 Squadron RAF for proving {{the use of}} helicopters in the Army Co-operation role, and two external stretchers could be fitted to the fuselage. 657 Squadron operated their Hoverfly IIs as <b>Air</b> <b>Observation</b> <b>Posts,</b> spotting for Army artillery units. The Hoverfly IIs remained in operation until April 1951, and one squadron example was displayed at the September 1950 Farnborough Air Show.|$|R

The EAF command believed the enemy aircraft were only a decoy meant to lure the MiG-21s away from the airbase, so that further waves of aircraft could attack the air base uninterrupted. Hence the fighter pilots were ordered to create a protective umbrella over the air base. Most importantly, they were instructed not to pursue and engage enemy aircraft before they had reached their target.|$|R

The nose structure of the Skeeter bore {{the weight of the}} rotorcraft's equipment, payload, and crew in addition to the inertial forces present during manoeuvring and landing loads from the nose wheel. The light-alloy structure contained control access panels in the floor and a battery unit within the nose itself.|$|E
25|$|Early on 1 May, eight squadrons of B-24 Liberator {{and four}} of B-25 Mitchells, and two squadrons of P-51 Mustangs from the 2nd Air Commando Group USAAF bombed and strafed known Japanese defences south of Rangoon. An <b>air</b> force <b>observation</b> <b>post,</b> a small {{detachment}} from Force 136 and a 700-man strong Gurkha composite parachute battalion from the 50th Indian Parachute Brigade were dropped from C-47s of the 2nd Air Commando Group on Elephant Point {{at the mouth of}} the Rangoon River in the middle of the morning. They eliminated some small Japanese parties, either left as rearguards or perhaps forgotten in the confusion of the evacuation, and captured or destroyed several guns overlooking the sea approaches to Rangoon.

25|$|The Gazelle {{proved to}} be a {{commercial}} success, which led Aerospatiale to quickly develop and introduce the SA 342 Gazelle series, which was equipped with uprated powerplants. Licensed production of the type did not just take place in the UK, domestic manufacturing was also conducted by Egyptian firm ABHCO. Yugoslavian production by SOKO reportedly produced a total of 132 Gazelles. As the Gazelle became progressively older, newer combat helicopters were brought into service in the anti-tank role; thus those aircraft previously configured as attack helicopters were often repurposed for other, secondary support duties, such as an <b>Air</b> <b>Observation</b> <b>Post</b> (AOP) for directing artillery fire, airborne forward air controller (ABFAC) to direct ground-attack aircraft, casualty evacuation, liaison, and communications relay missions.|$|E
25|$|No. 16 <b>Air</b> <b>Observation</b> <b>Post</b> Flight {{was formed}} at Lae in New Guinea on 20 October 1944. At {{the time it}} was {{established}} it had a strength of four pilots and was equipped with Taylorcraft Auster light aircraft. These aircraft were among the 56 Austers that the RAAF eventually ordered. The first batch was ordered in 1944 to equip Nos. 16 and 17 AOP Flights. No. 16 AOP Flight was initially assigned to the headquarters of the First Army, and conducted a mix of training and operational flights from Lae during late 1944 and early 1945. The operational missions included flying supplies and personnel to Army units fighting the Japanese, evacuating wounded soldiers and conducting reconnaissance tasks. The flight established at detachment at Tadji on 30 January 1945 to support the Army's 17th Brigade during the Aitape–Wewak campaign.|$|E

The Canadian squadrons were {{equipped}} with Auster Mark IV and V aircraft. The pilots and {{observers in the}} squadrons were officers recruited from the Royal Canadian Artillery and O.R.s from the Royal Canadian Artillery and Royal Canadian Air Force. The pilots were trained to fly de Havilland Tiger Moth aircraft at No. 22 Elementary Flying Training School (Cambridge); thereafter, successful candidates were further trained at No. 43 Operational Training Unit, the AOP School based at RAF Andover dedicated to training British and Commonwealth AOP flight-crews. Lieutenant-Colonel Terry Willett, Royal Artillery, commanded No. 43 OTU at RAF Andover. British Army AOP training at RAF Andover, with Auster Mark V aircraft, continued until at least 1949. One of the three squadrons was re-established after the war as 665 Squadron, Army Air Corps, based in Northern Ireland.|$|E

The wing arrived at Torokina in October to begin supporting Australian troops during the Bougainville Campaign. No.5 Squadron, equipped with eighteen CAC Boomerangs and four CAC Wirraways, {{was assigned to}} mark targets for F4U Corsairs of the Royal New Zealand Air Force. The Austers of No.17 AOP Flight were used for reconnaissance and courier work, becoming, {{in the words of}} the official history, [...] "the eyes of the battalion commanders". No.10 Communications Unit flew Avro Ansons and Bristol Beauforts on courier, reconnaissance, supply, and anti-malarial spraying missions; it was renamed No.10 Local Air Supply Unit in March 1945. Between December 1944 and January 1945, the wing lost one Auster, one Wirraway, and one Boomerang on operations.|$|E

Comprising fighter and dive-bomber squadrons, the wing {{had been established}} to undertake air defence and patrol tasks in and around western New Guinea. Hely departed Merauke in September 1944 to establish an army cooperation formation, No.84 Wing, in Cairns, Queensland. It {{was one of two}} such wings formed by the RAAF in the South West Pacific Theatre late in World WarII. They were, as described by the official history of the RAAF in the Pacific, [...] "essentially non-offensive in character", responsible for reconnaissance, artillery spotting, supply drops to ground forces, spraying DDT to combat malaria, and guiding close support aircraft to their objectives. The wing could also carry out its own strikes on [...] "targets of opportunity". No. 84 Wing comprised No.5 (Tactical Reconnaissance) Squadron, No.17 <b>Air</b> <b>Observation</b> <b>Post</b> Flight, No.10 Communication Unit (subsequently renamed No.10 Local Air Supply Unit), and No.39 Operational Base Unit. It deployed to Torokina in October to support Australian troops during the Bougainville Campaign. No.5 Squadron, equipped with CAC Boomerangs and [...] Wirraways, was assigned to mark targets for F4U Corsairs of the Royal New Zealand Air Force. [...] Between December 1944 and January 1945, the wing lost one Auster, one Wirraway, and one Boomerang on operations.
