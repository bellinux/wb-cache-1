Two Lancasters - one from 44 Squadron, flown by Pilot Officer Garyer, and one from 207 Squadron - received identical landing instructions from the Spilsby control tower and collided in the <b>approach</b> <b>funnel</b> over the village of Bratoft, east of the airfield, killing both crews and scattering debris over a large area. This led to revised approach procedures being implemented with aircraft being allocated specific time slots to prevent overcrowding in the circuit.|$|E

A 15000 m2 international terminal has been opened to passengers, {{similar to the}} spacious modern international departure terminal that became operational on 14 May 2007. Five conveyor belts have been installed at the arrival terminal. The approach to Calicut airport runway is surrounded with hills and valleys. The <b>approach</b> <b>funnel</b> area of the runway 28 is a thirty- to seventy-metre-deep (98- to 230-foot-deep) undulated valley up to a distance of 6000 m, immediately following the tabletop runway length of 2860 m.

50|$|During {{the late}} morning of April 3, 1964, a devastating tornado (later retroactively rated as an F5 on the Fujita Scale) {{swept across the}} {{northern}} portion of Wichita Falls and neighboring Sheppard Air Force Base. The event made history as it {{would become one of}} the first tornadoes ever to be shown on live television. KAUZ-TV interrupted regular programming that morning to provide a live tornado warning in which the image of the supercell thunderstorm was shown on the station's weather radar by then-meteorologist Ted Shaw. The station's weather staff received permission to relocate a large, heavy studio camera outside the Channel 6 studios on Seymour Highway, and pointed toward the tornado - which initially appeared as a large, rotating dust cloud - as it approached the northwest portion of Wichita Falls, with Shaw and reporter Dee Fletcher providing commentary, warning viewers of the <b>approaching</b> <b>funnel,</b> and cameraman Carl Nichols recording the footage. The tornado, which had a peak width of 800 ft, killed seven people and injured 111 others. Damage estimates exceeded $15 million and some 225 homes and businesses were destroyed {{on the north side of}} town and at Sheppard AFB. In 1967, KAUZ-TV was one of several stations nationwide to broadcast The Las Vegas Show, a short-lived late night program from the ill-fated Overmyer Network that ran for a few weeks.|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} description of the events ruling ligand/protein interac- tion and an accurate estimation of the drug affinity to its target is of great help in speeding drug discovery strategies. We have de- veloped a metadynamics-based <b>approach,</b> named <b>funnel</b> metady- namics, that allows the ligand to enhance the sampling of the target binding sites and its solvated states. This method leads to an effi- cient characterization of the binding free-energy surface and an accurate calculation of the absolute protein–ligand binding free energy. We illustrate our protocol in two systems, benzamidine/ trypsin and SC- 558 /cyclooxygenase 2. In both cases, the X-ray con- formation has been found as the lowest free-energy pose, and the computed protein–ligand binding free energy in good agreement with experiments. Furthermore, funnel metadynamics unveils im- portant information about the binding process, such as the presence of alternative binding modes and the role of waters. The results achieved at an affordable computational cost make funnel meta- dynamics a valuable method for drug discovery and for dealing with a variety of problems in chemistry, physics, and material science...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{asymptotic}} tracking of reference signals is {{considered in the}} context of m-input, m-output linear systems (A,B,C) with the following structural properties: (i) CB is sign definite (but not necessarily symmetric), (ii) the zero dynamics are exponentially stable. The class of reference signals is the set of all possible solutions of a fixed, stable, linear, homogeneous differential equation (with associated characteristic polynomial α). The first control objective is asymptotic tracking, by the system output y[*]=[*]Cx, of any reference signal. The second objective is guaranteed error e[*]=[*]y − r transient performance: e should evolve within a prescribed performance funnel (determined by a function φ). Both objectives are achieved simultaneously by an internal model in series with a proportional time-varying error feedback t↦ u(t) =−ν (k(t)) e(t), where ν is a smooth function with the properties and, and k(t) is generated via a nonlinear function of the product ‖ e(t) ‖ φ (t) The feedback structure essentially exploits an intrinsic high-gain property of the system by ensuring that, if (t,e(t)) <b>approaches</b> the <b>funnel</b> boundary, then the gain attains values sufficiently large to preclude boundary contact...|$|R
25|$|A large tornado {{touched down}} in {{southwest}} Madison County, TN after dark. It was initially 200 to 300 yards in diameter; however, rapid intensification occurred as the <b>funnel</b> <b>approached</b> Jackson. The now 1/2 mile wide tornado plowed through downtown Jackson and {{damaged or destroyed}} hundreds of buildings and homes. Several structures were leveled, warranting an F4 rating. 66 people were injured and 11 fatalities were reported, most of which occurred downtown. The tornado continued into Henderson county, though aerial damage surveys indicate significant weakening occurred just {{to the east of}} Jackson. Sporadic F0 to F1 damage was observed {{for the remainder of the}} tornado's path. It lifted just to the west of Lexington, after having traveled for an impressive 39 miles.|$|R
40|$|Tracking of a {{reference}} signal (assumed bounded with essentially bounded deriva-tive) is considered {{in a context}} of a class of nonlinear systems, with output y, described by functional di®erential equations (a generalization of the class of linear minimum-phase systems with positive high-frequency gain). The primary control objective is tracking with prescribed accuracy: given ¸> 0 (arbitrarily small), de-termine a feedback strategy which ensures that, for every admissible system and reference signal, the tracking error e = y ¡ r is ultimately smaller than ¸ (that is, ke(t) k < ¸ for all t su±ciently large). The second objective is guaranteed transient performance: the evolution of the tracking error should be contained in a prescribed performance funnel F. Adopting the simple non-adaptive feedback control structure u(t) = ¡k(t) e(t), it is shown that the above objectives can be attained if the gain is generated by the nonlinear, memoryless feedback k(t) = KF (t; e(t)), where KF is any continuous function exhibiting two speci¯c properties, the ¯rst of which en-sures that, if (t; e(t)) <b>approaches</b> the <b>funnel</b> boundary, then the gain attains values su±ciently large to preclude boundary contact, and the second of which obviates the need for large gain values away from the funnel boundary...|$|R
40|$|Meeting the {{challenge}} of ensuring dependable and secure logistics networks in changing competitive environments necessitates continually adapting the networks. This in turn requires the support of suitable methods to model and simulate logistics networks. A mesoscopic simulation approach eliminates the inherent deficits in both the microscopic and the macroscopic approach to simulation. Instead of individual flow objects, the mesoscopic approach monitors quantities of objects that belong to a logical group. The results are not obtained by counting individual objects but by using mathematical formulas to calculate the results as continuous quantities in every modeling time step t. The basic components of the mesoscopic modeling <b>approach</b> are multichannel <b>funnels,</b> multichannel delay elements, sources and sinks. Furthermore, this approach distinguishes between different product types. The principles of mesoscopic modeling and their implementation with simulation are treated...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for solving equality constrained nonlinear optimization problems involving twice continuously differentiable functions. The method employs a trust <b>funnel</b> <b>approach</b> {{consisting of two}} phases: a first phase to locate an ϵ-feasible point and a second phase to seek optimality while maintaining at least ϵ-feasibility. A two-phase approach of this kind based on a cubic regularization methodology was recently proposed along with a supporting worst-case iteration complexity analysis. Unfortunately, however, in that approach, the objective function is completely ignored {{in the first phase}} when ϵ-feasibility is sought. The main contribution of the method proposed in this paper is that the same worst-case iteration complexity is achieved, but with a first phase that also accounts for improvements in the objective function. As such, the method typically requires fewer iterations in the second phase, as the results of numerical experiments demonstrate...|$|R

40|$|Like {{protein folding}} and crystallization, the {{self-assembly}} of complexes {{is a fundamental}} form of biomolecular organization. While the number of methods for creating synthetic complexes is growing rapidly, most require empirical tuning of assembly conditions and/or produce low yields. We use coarse-grained simulations of the assembly kinetics of complexes to identify generic limitations on yields that arise because of the many simultaneous interactions allowed between the components and intermediates of a complex. Efficient assembly occurs when nucleation is fast and growth pathways are few, i. e. {{when there is an}} assembly "funnel". For typical complexes, an assembly funnel occurs in a narrow window of conditions whose location is highly complex specific. However, by redesigning the components this window can be drastically broadened, so that complexes can form quickly across many conditions. The generality of this <b>approach</b> suggests assembly <b>funnel</b> design as a foundational strategy for robust biomolecular complex synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Current {{wind power}} {{technology}} is not economically feasible {{throughout most of}} the United States due to low average wind speeds. A design for a small-scale wind concentrator device suitable for use in areas of low wind velocity was tested using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Using a novel approach, the device seeks to accelerate incoming air above minimum velocities required for economical power generation. The novel <b>approach</b> employs a <b>funnel</b> shaped inlet with relief vents along the circumference, so as to alleviate backpressure. Both inlet and outlet sections utilize funnel shapes with both parabolic and hyperbolic regions. All geometry and mesh models were created using ICEM 12. 1. Simulations were performed using Fluent 12. 1. 2. Turbulence was modeled using the standard k-epsilon model. All mesh models contained roughly 500, 000 unstructured computational cells. CFD simulations predict a 2. 53 X acceleration of incoming air through the throat of the device (based upon a 2 m/s ambient wind speed). Similar performance was seen across the range of 1 - 12 m/s. Analysis focused on testing various designs to reduce losses due to turbulent energy and backpressure, with a focus on maximizing the throat velocity where a turbine can be located. Tested variables include funnel shape, lengths of both inlet and outlet funnels, and curvature of the inlet rim. In addition to design of the device, the effect on airflow through the relief vents by a surrounding casing was also analyzed...|$|R

We investigate the plasma flow out of funnels with a new 2 D MHD time dependent model including the solar atmosphere {{all the way from the}} chromosphere to the corona. The plasma in the funnel is treated in the single-fluid MHD approximation including radiative losses, anisotropic thermal conduction, and two different parameterized heating functions. We obtain plasma properties (e. g. density, temperature and flow speed) within the funnel for each heating function. From the results of the MHD calculation we derive spectral profiles of a low corona emission line (Ne VIII, 770 angstrom). This allows us e. g. to study the Doppler shifts, across the funnel. These results indicate a systematic variation of the Doppler shifts in lines formed in the low corona depending on the heating function used. The line shift above the magnetic field concentration in the network is stronger than in the inter-network in both cases. However, for one of the heating functions, the maximum blue-shift (outflow) is not to be found in the very center of the funnel but in the vicinity of the center. This is not the case of the second heating function where the maximum is well aligned with the centre of the funnel. This model directly relates for the first time the form of the heating function to the thermodynamic and spectral properties of the plasma in a funnel. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Current {{international}} {{guidelines for}} breast cancer follow-up are not specific to individual risk of local regional recurrences. Instead, for personalised follow-up it is required to have more precise estimates of local regional recurrence probability {{as a function of}} time. The objective {{of this study is to}} identify prognostic factors, and to quantify individualized and time dependent local regional recurrence risk rates. Methods Prognostic factors for local regional recurrence of breast cancer were identified due to a three-step <b>funnel</b> <b>approach,</b> including: scoping literature review, expert consultation and stepwise multivariate regression analysis. Quantification of the prognostic value of each risk factor was performed with a regression model based on a five-year dataset of women diagnosed with breast cancer in the Netherlands in 2005 or 2006 (n= 17762). Six-month interval risk probabilities were derived from regression estimates by calculating coefficients of the prognostic factors. Results Eight prognostic factors were identified, including: age, tumour size, multifocality, gradation, adjuvant chemo-, adjuvant radiation-, hormonal therapy and triple negative status. Expected inter-patient variability was elucidated by average, and high risk example patient types with local regional, non-uniform distributed, recurrence risks of 5. 2 % and 12 % over a five-year period. Conclusions It is concluded that local regional recurrence risks are not distributed uniformly, and time depended, over the five-year follow-up period. The calculated prognostic value of the factors enables quantification of risks for local regional recurrences on six-month time intervals for the individual patient. Implicating improved allocation of hospital capacities and resources, local regional recurrence risk profiling is a first step towards tailored follow-up in breast cancer car...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{spectroscopy}} of aromatic crystals such as naphthalene {{has been}} known for decades, recent advances in laser spectroscopy have made it possible to study the dynamic nature of the molecular exciton in these systems. Electronic excitation dynamics studied by picosecond time-resolved laser spectroscopy in the molecular crystal naphthalene yields information about energy transfer which can not be obtained otherwise. The nature of these dynamics are affected greatly by the exciton type and exciton band structure of this system. Study of steady state spectroscopy gives information about the equilibrium population of the exciton states while time-resolved spectroscopy can show the effects of electronic energy transfer. ^ Results showing the effects of impurity induced states on exciton trapping in β-methylnaphthalene doped naphthalene crystals are presented. Time-resolved and steady state spectroscopy are used to show the presence of secondary traps in this system. The data is interpreted using an energy <b>funnel</b> <b>approach</b> which is consistent with thermal assisted de-trapping of the secondary trap back into the exciton band even at low temperatures. ^ Determination of intra-band exciton scattering is optically detected using picosecond time-resolved laser spectroscopy in the quasi-two-dimensional first singlet exciton of naphthalene. Thermalization of the exciton band is complete within a few hundred picoseconds for pure material. Comparing inelastic exciton scattering results of nominally pure crystal to those with substitutional and isotopic impuries can test impurity scattering effects on the inelastic scattering rate. Comparing results to one-dimensional exciton scattering mark the diverse method of approaching equilibrium with thermalization times differing by orders of magnitude. ...|$|R

40|$|A High Speed Railway goes across Wuqing {{district}} of Tianjin, China. Historical {{studies showed that}} the land subsidence of this area was very serious, which would give rise to huge security risk to the high speed railway. For detecting the detailed subsidence related to the high speed railway, we use the multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) technique to extract regional scale subsidence of Wuqing district. Take it into consideration that Wuqing district is a suburban region with large area of low coherence farmland, we select the temporarily coherent point InSAR (TCP-InSAR) approach for MT-InSAR analysis. The TCP-InSAR is a potential approach for detecting land subsidence in low coherence areas as it can identify and analysis coherent points between just two images and can acquire a reliable solution without conventional phase unwrapping. This paper extended the TCP-InSAR with use of ultrashort spatial baseline (USB) interferograms. As thetopographic effects are negligible in the USB interferograms, an external digital elevation model (DEM) is no longer needed in interferometric processing, and the parameters needed to be estimated were simplified at the same time. With use of 17 TerraSAR-X (TSX) images acquired from 2009 to 2010 over Wuqing district, the annual subsidence rates along the high speed railway were derived by the USB-TCPInSAR <b>approach.</b> Two subsidence <b>funnels</b> were found at ShuangJie town and around Wuqing Station with subsidence rate of − 17 ∼ − 27 mm/year and − 7 ∼ − 17 mm/year, respectively. The subsidence rates derived by USB-TCPInSAR were compared with those derived by the conventional TCP-InSAR that uses an external DEM for differential interferometry. The mean and the standard deviation {{of the differences between}} two types of results at 370697 TCPs are − 4. 43 × 10 − 6 mm/year and ± 1. 4673 mm/year, respectively. Further comparison with the subsidence results mentioned in several other studies were made, which shows good consistencies. The results verify that even without using a DEM the USB-TCPInSAR method can detect land subsidence accurately in flat areas...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} views of adolescents about mental health promotion in secondary schools. Gaining views of young-people about issues that affect them (Ofsted, 2005 a) provides moral and legal benefits for individuals, organisations and the wider democratic community (Badham and Wade, 2005). There is limited research in this specific area (Roose, Yazdani and John, 2003). Background and rationale for this research reflect reports that 10 % of young-people experience a mental health 'disorder' (Palmer, 2005). Adolescence being a particularly vulnerable phase demonstrated by statistical increases in mental health problems (National Children's Bureau, 2004) : especially depression, anxiety, psychosis, eating and behaviour disorders (Goodyer et aI, 2009). To decrease numbers of young-people with mental health problems a need arises for promoting mental health as preventative initiatives. Schools are highlighted as organisations needing to promote healthy outcomes (Department for Education & Schools, 2004) including mental health promotion. A flexible design, using self-contained focus group methodology explores views of 26 adolescents (81 %) male and (19 %) female: {{from a variety of}} cultural backgrounds and vulnerable groups. A <b>funnel</b> <b>approach</b> structured the five focus groups, each consisting of between three- eight adolescents (12 - 19 years). They were asked semi-structured questions in an informal, child-centred environment (Morgan, Gibbs, Maxwell and Britten, 2002). 4 A Grounded Theory analysis of the focus group material enabled the categories to emerge. The grounded theory is being developed into a whole school mental health promotion audit tool to enable these adolescent views to be heard in the future. The research concludes that in order for secondary schools to promote mental health, society and school communities need to provide active listening cultures and an inclusive ethos to embrace mental health promotion at a variety of levels. A need arises for adults to have knowledge and understanding of adolescent identity and development and to know the importance of relationships reflected in attachment theory.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between language and society has encouraged the researcher in conducting this study. The research {{is intended to}} describe and identify the phonological variations of Bahasa Indonesia spoken by Dani people in group communication in Surabaya. The data of the study are limited only {{to the words of}} Bahasa Indonesia that are spoken by Dani people. As the basis of analysis, the theories on the phonological variations and the ethnic background of Papua, especially Dani people, are presented in the second chapter. Furthermore, the linguistic theory is also reviewed. This theory becomes the basis on analysing the phonological variations of Bahasa Indonesia spoken by Dani people. To equip the researcher with knowledge on the background of the analysed words, the characteristics and the geographical features of Dani are also included. In analysing the phonological variations of Bahasa Indonesia, the researcher employed the <b>funnel</b> <b>approach</b> consisting of exploratory, descriptive, and explanatory stages as the research design. Furthermore, in this study, the researcher used content analyses, case study, field note, reflective analysis and practical linguistic analysis. By employing those techniques, the researcher did three stages, i. e., collect the data, analyse them and discuss them. As a result of the analysis, {{it can be seen that}} there are phonological variations of Bahasa Indonesia spoken by Dani people. It can be deduced that there are six phonological variations of Bahasa Indonesia spoken by Dani people in group communication in Surabaya. They are vowel change, consonant change, semi-vowel change, consonant dropping, final syllable dropping, and contraction (merger). There are factors behind the phonological variations of Bahasa Indonesia spoken by Dani people. The influencing factors that support the variations are constructed based on the interference of Dani people's mother tongue and on the idea of 'ease of articulation'. Ease of articulation is the idea of changing the sound speech in articulatory simplification. Finally, it is expected that the result of this study can contribute theoretically and practically to English Department students and EFL teachers. The English Department students can take this study as the additional materials and/or as examples when taking the subjects of Sociolinguistics. For EFL teachers, they can use this study as examples of Bahasa Indonesia spoken by Dani people in teaching Sociolinguistics. This study also contributes some inputs tor Dani people, as they can understand that they have spoken the phonological variations of Bahasa Indonesia and realize that it is influenced by their mother tongue...|$|R
40|$|Tribally owned gaming {{facilities}} {{have become an}} increasingly popular vehicle for economic development throughout Indian Country. As an incidental consequence of this industry 2 ̆ 7 s growth, many non-tribal members now {{come into contact with}} tribal-gaming enterprises as either customers or employees. Consequently, tribal gaming establishments have become a vital nexus in battles over what tribal sovereignty should entail in a modern social and economic context. Indeed, the legal framework surrounding these entities highlights a central tension within our modern-day federal Indian law regime-one that often forces tribal governments to choose between maintaining absolute sovereign self-governance on the one hand, and providing modes of economic development, such as gaming, on the other. Both state and federal authorities {{play a role in the}} often complex regulatory structure around labor relations at tribal-gaming facilities. This means that non-tribal members may take labor and employment disputes outside of tribal laws and courts-a situation that tribes regard as an incursion upon tribal sovereignty. Nonetheless, labor advocates argue that the opposite situation would give tribal employers little incentive to give fair, adequate protections to their workers. This Comment seeks to address the tension between tribal sovereignty and workers 2 ̆ 7 rights by proposing a positive approach. In concrete terms, this <b>approach</b> seeks to <b>funnel</b> labor and employment disputes through tribal courts by strengthening tribal labor and employment laws and alternative dispute resolution systems. The positive approach represents a third way to tribal sovereignty- where tribes, much like other nation-states facing the perils of globalization, can navigate global and local power networks from a position of strength rather than remain outside of them. The positive approach can also benefit workers by creating a strong internal tribal authority to protect labor and employment rights and by fostering opportunities for tribes to settle disputes through traditional or culturally based dispute resolution practices. This approach is in stark contrast to the decidedly anti-worker positions that some tribes have recently adopted by passing right-to-work laws and waging court battles against unfavorable shifts in the law. While the positive approach has the significant drawback of curbing some traditional elements of tribal sovereignty, its chief strength is its pragmatism, in that it works within, rather than against, recent shifts in federal Indian law jurisprudence. The approach can also provide a blueprint for economic development and tribal self-governance that can successfully coexist...|$|R
