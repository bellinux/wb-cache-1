25|$|Airport {{policing}} in the United Kingdom {{has taken}} many forms since {{the rise of}} scheduled airline services in the post-war period. Policing at major civilian airports was the responsibility of specialist constabularies operated by three central government departments until 1974, when the rise in international terrorism saw armed police from territorial police forces deployed to major airports under {{the provisions of the}} Policing of Airports Act. As more minor airports grew in size, they too switched to armed police provided by local police forces. However, the funding agreements for the provision of such services varied wildly from airport to airport, leading to disagreements between <b>airport</b> <b>operators</b> and Chief Constables. A new regime, the Airport Security Planning Framework, came into force in January 2010, and brought <b>airport</b> <b>operators,</b> airlines and police forces together to develop joint security and policing plans for all passenger airports.|$|E

By 1949 a runway of 2,000m, the terminal building, apron and taxiways were constructed and the airport was re-launched. The current airport terminal was constructed in 1977. The same year, the airport's runway was strengthened and lengthened by 500m. In 1986, Rostov was designated an international airport, and scheduled international flights were launched in 1991.

25|$|Ownership of {{the airport}} has changed {{a number of times}} over the years but the airport was wholly owned by Blackpool Borough Council until 2004 when it was sold to a {{consortium}} led by Wolverhampton <b>Airport</b> <b>operators</b> City Hopper Ltd (CHAL), who operated it until May 2008 when Balfour Beatty purchased MAR Property's 95% stake; Blackpool Borough Council having retained 5%. The remaining 5% is held by Blackpool Borough Council. During 2014 Balfour Beatty claimed to be looking for a buyer for the airport and then after just one month announced that it was to close the Airport. On 15 October 2014, the airport's terminal and Air Traffic Control provision was closed with the last scheduled flights to Dublin & Isle of Man leaving in the late afternoon.

25|$|The {{new owners}} {{concluded}} that the airport needed a new control tower and a new terminal building. Construction was issued as a public tender in 1987, but the military decided to stop the plans. At this time, a debate about a new location for Oslo Airport had started. One of the proposals was to use Gardermoen, {{one of the two}} permanently used air stations in Eastern Norway. The air force was worried {{that they would have to}} abandon Gardermoen and relocate to Torp. It would be likely that this would give twenty or forty fighter jets stationed at Torp. The military expansion plans were not in line with the civilian ones. At the same time, the military felt that the existing terminal building was located too close to the arsenal, and that a new terminal had to relocate further away. The <b>airport</b> <b>operators</b> needed additional space. The old terminal had a capacity of 10,000 passengers; in 1984, it served 42,486, and in 1987, 100,907 passengers. By 1990, the issues related to Gardermoen had been resolved, and the military no longer had objections to expanding Torp.|$|E

30|$|As {{outlined}} above, each of {{the scenarios}} depicted a conflict between shareholding and non-shareholding stakeholders’ interests. To manipulate stakeholder management, this conflict was resolved by the <b>airport</b> <b>operator</b> deciding either in favor of shareholding stakeholders (by not fulfilling non-shareholding stakeholders’ claims and thereby prioritizing a dividend payment for shareholders over non-shareholding stakeholders’ interests) or in favor of non-shareholding stakeholders (by fulfilling non-shareholding stakeholders’ claims and thereby prioritizing non-shareholding stakeholders’ interests over a dividend payment for shareholders). In scenario 1, a decision in favor of non-shareholding stakeholders (i.e., the <b>airport</b> <b>operator’s</b> airline customers) would for example be phrased as follows: “The <b>airport</b> <b>operator</b> decides to fulfill the airline customers’ request, i.e., to clearly reduce airport fees, and thereby prioritizes the airline customers’ interests over a dividend payment for shareholders”.|$|R
