40|$|Based on {{the concept}} of losslessness in digital filter structures, this paper derives a general class of maximally {{decimated}} M-channel quadrature mirror filter banks that lead to perfect reconstruction. The perfect-reconstruction property guarantees that the reconstructed signalhat{x} (n) is a delayed version of the input signal x (n), i. e.,hat{x} (n) = x (n - n_{ 0 }). It is shown that such a property can be satisfied if the <b>alias</b> <b>component</b> matrix (AC matrix for short) is unitary on the unit circle of the z plane. The number of channels M is arbitrary, and when M is two, the results reduce to certain recently reported 2 -channel perfect-reconstruction QMF structures. A procedure, based on recently reported FIR cascaded-lattice structures, is presented for optimal design of such FIR M-channel filter banks. Design examples are included...|$|E

40|$|A {{major problem}} {{affecting}} software quality and software development productivity {{is the use}} of incorrect and inconsistent models of the problem domain, and of the proposed problem solution, during the software development process. Most methods used in the early phases of the SDLC, and the models that they produce, are semantically imprecise. In addition, many different models, representing different aspects of the problem or proposed solution, are used. These models often describe the same concept from different viewpoints, resulting in <b>alias</b> <b>components</b> in the models. These factors combine to produce an inconsistent description that will cause problems in the later phases of the SDLC. Our solution is firstly to make the methods and models more precise by defining their semantics, and secondly to ensure that partially overlapping models are semantically, as well as syntactically, consistent. The approach we have taken is to embed a method, and its model, inside a tool and expose the operations it performs on the model to other tools via semantic events. We maintain tool independence by using a co-ordinator to translate semantic events in one model into appropriate semantic events on <b>alias</b> <b>components</b> in other models...|$|R
30|$|As {{can be seen}} in Figure 9, {{the real}} AC 30 (first column) has a {{relatively}} high noise level due to the 50 [*]Hz power supply hum and its harmonic components. This power supply noise is clearly audible also in quiet parts when using the amplifier in a real playing situation. Interestingly, the aliasing analysis plots for both virtual AC 30 plugins (second and third column) show severe aliasing phenomenon. The <b>aliased</b> <b>component</b> at 1 [*]kHz is roughly 40 [*]dB above the auditory spectrum estimate at full gain settings, making it clearly audible. In fact, the heavy aliasing behavior can strongly be heard also by listening to the logsweep responses of the AC 30 plugins. It {{should be noted that the}} power supply noise is generally less irritating than aliasing noise, since the former stays largely constant regardless of the input signal. Aliasing noise, in turn, changes radically according to the input signal, and can it be an especially undesired phenomenon when playing high bent notes, since when the original tone moves up in frequency, the strongest <b>aliased</b> <b>components</b> move down, creating an unpleasant effect.|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of aliasing is important when sampling analog signals. In {{cases where the}} signal is bandlimited, one can avoid aliasing by ensuring that the sampling rate {{is higher than the}} Nyquist rate. But in cases where the signal is not bandlimited, aliasing is unavoidable if the signal is not filtered before it is sampled. It is then crucial to understand the phenomenon in order to estimate the distortion generated when the signal is reconstructed from its samples. Using the software package MATLAB by MathWorks, Inc., two examples are presented. The first is a pure sinusoid which is sampled at both higher and lower than the Nyquist rate, and the frequency spectrum of both sampled sinusoids are compared to illustrate the effect of aliasing. The second and more interesting case is a square wave which has an unlimited bandwidth. The square wave is a periodic wave that has Fourier expansion with odd harmonics only, the amplitudes of which drop as lin. A square wave is synthesized using MATLAB and its Fourier transform is presented graphically (The synthesized square wave inherently produces <b>aliased</b> <b>components).</b> The odd harmonics and the <b>aliased</b> <b>components</b> seen on the graph are analyzed and compared to the predicted theoretical results.

40|$|A linear {{periodically}} time-varying (LPTV) {{system is}} a linear time-varying system with the coefficients changing periodically, which is widely used in control, communications, signal processing, and even circuit modeling. This thesis concentrates on identification of LPTV systems. To this end, the representations of LPTV systems are thoroughly reviewed. Identification methods are developed accordingly. The usefulness of the proposed identification methods is verified by the simulation results. A periodic input signal is applied to a finite impulse response (FIR) -LPTV system and measure the noise-contaminated output. Using such periodic inputs, we show that we can formulate the problem of identification of LPTV systems in the frequency domain. With {{the help of the}} discrete Fourier transform (DFT), the identification method reduces to finding the least-squares (LS) solution of a set of linear equations. A sufficient condition for the identifiability of LPTV systems is given, which can be used to find appropriate inputs for the purpose of identification. In the frequency domain, we show that the input and the output can be related by using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and a least-squares method can be used to identify the <b>alias</b> <b>components.</b> A lower bound on the mean square error (MSE) of the estimated <b>alias</b> <b>components</b> is given for FIR-LPTV systems.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} methods have been demonstrated which increase the speed of MR acquisition by decreasing the number of sequential phase encodes. The UNFOLD technique is based on time interleaving of k-space lines in sequential images and exploits the property that the outer portion of the field-of-view is relatively static. The differences in spatial sensitivity of mul-tiple receiver coils may be exploited using SENSE or SMASH techniques to eliminate the <b>aliased</b> <b>component</b> that results from undersampling k-space. In this article, an adaptive method of sensitivity encoding is presented which incorporates both spa-tial and temporal filtering. Temporal filtering and spatial encod-ing may be combined by acquiring phase encodes in an inter-leaved manner. In this way the <b>aliased</b> <b>components</b> are alter-nating phase. The SENSE formulation is not altered by the phase of the alias artifact; however, for imperfect estimates of coil sensitivities the residual artifact will have alternating phase using this approach. This {{is the essence of}} combining temporal filtering (UNFOLD) with spatial sensitivity encoding (SENSE). Any residual artifact will be temporally frequency-shifted to the band edge and thus may be further suppressed by temporal low-pass filtering. By combining both temporal and spatial fil-tering a high degree of alias artifact rejection may be achieved with less stringent requirements on accuracy of coil sensitivity estimates and temporal low-pass filter selectivity than would be required using each method individually. Experimental results that demonstrate the adaptive spatiotemporal filtering method (adaptive TSENSE) with acceleration factor R 5 2, for real-time nonbreath-held cardiac MR imaging during exercise induced stress are presented.

Recent approaches like MPEG- 4 (ACE-profile) and H. 26 L use higher DV resolutions of 1 / 4 -pel and 1 / 8 -pel. In order to estimate and compensate fractional-pel displacements, the image signal has to be interpolated. Especially for higher DV resolutions an efficient interpolation filter is necessary [13]. Thus, in MPEG- 4 (ACE-profile) and H. 26 L 6 or 8 -tap Wiener interpolation filters are applied [5, 3]. These Wiener filters were designed to interpolate the image signal while reducing spacial <b>aliasing</b> <b>components</b> that deteriorate the motion compensated prediction [6].
