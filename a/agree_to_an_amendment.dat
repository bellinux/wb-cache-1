50|$|The suit {{alleged that}} Edwards {{entered into a}} loan {{agreement}} with Strikers' ownership in July 2016, by transferring $450,000 to his team’s cross-state rivals via his own company, Marketing Solutions Publications. A few weeks later his company made an additional loan of $120,000. Court records for the case imply that shortly after that, both parties <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> the original deal in which the Strikers were released from the initial $450,000 loan and Edwards <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> loan them another $120,000. The new amendment specified that Fort Lauderdale’s total debt would not surpass the $240,000 already owed, but according to Edwards’ complaint, he <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> wire another $80,000 to the Strikers on September 2 because the team lacked sufficient funds <b>to</b> host <b>a</b> match against the New York Cosmos the next day.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, Queens Liberation Front <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{compromise}} <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> New York City's anti-discrimination ordinance {{that added}} sexual orientation to the ordinance, but clarified the ordinance did not cover cross-dressing. The organization's director, Bebe Scarpie, {{met with the}} bill's sponsor at City Hall and <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> the compromise. The organization's lawyer, Richard Levidow, believed the exclusionary clause violated the United States Constitution and was therefore unenforceable.|$|R

In drafting the impeachment articles, the Judiciary Committee tried to stick closely to the jury findings on tax evasion and to the conviction itself.

In the evening, her brother, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, broadcast a similar public appeal. Then at 9:30 pm, a television broadcast of King Bhumibol, Suchinda, and Chamlong was shown, in which the King demanded that the two put <b>an</b> end <b>to</b> their confrontation and work together through parliamentary processes. Following the broadcast, Suchinda released Chamlong and announced an amnesty for protesters.

50|$|On 15 November 2016, the House of Assembly {{split the}} {{aforementioned}} bill and introduced the Statutes Amendment (Surrogacy Eligibility) Bill 2016, a bill which dealt exclusively with surrogacy and assisted reproductive treatments. The bill amends several other acts {{so as to}} allow same-sex couples access to altruistic surrogacy arrangements and ensure fertile women and same-sex couples have access to assisted reproductive technology. Debate on the bill continued on 16 November, {{at which point the}} lower house removed provisions in the bill allowing single people access to altruistic surrogacy arrangements. The following day the bill passed the lower house by 25 votes to 16. The bill proceeded to the Legislative Council. The bill passed the Council by 14 votes to 3, though two important amendments were made to the bill at the clauses stage. Family First members introduced <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> <b>to</b> allow assisted reproductive treatment providers the right to conscientiously object to providing services based on the patient's sexual orientation. Greens member Tammy Franks responded by introducing <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> that would require any services that refused treatment to be placed on a publicly available list. The bill returned to the House of Assembly (which by that stage had risen for the Summer break) for consideration of the Council's amendments. On 15 February 2017, the House <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>amendment</b> moved by the socially conservative Labor member Tom Kenyon which removed the proposed requirement for those who object to providing treatment on religions or conscience grounds to be placed on a list. The remainder of the bill was accepted by the House. The bill returned to the Council for consideration of Kenyon's amendment, which provided its approval on 28 February. The bill received royal assent on 15 March, becoming the Statutes Amendment (Surrogacy Eligibility) Act 2017. Following a proclamation issued by the Governor, the law came into effect on 21 March 2017.|$|R

40|$|In 1989 the Secretary of Energy {{changed the}} mission of the Richland Operations Office (ROO) from {{supporting}} weapons production to environmental restoration and waste management. Through the Hanford Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (Tri-Party Agreement), ROO was required to survey Hanford for contaminants, analyze samples, and determine the most cost-effective method to clean up the waste identified. The objective of this audit was to determine if the Department of Energy (DOE) and ROO had evaluated alternatives to accomplish certain site characterization activities in a cost-effective manner. This audit showed that neither the DOE nor ROO evaluated alternatives to ensure that two site characterization activities were accomplished in a cost-effective manner. First, DOE accelerated the core sampling program for high-level radioactive waste tanks from 6 to 3 years. DOE made this decision in response <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (Safety Board) recommendation without first determining if the method chosen (core sampling) was the most efficient and economical method to satisfy the Safety Board`s concerns. This 3 -year acceleration would cost over $ 71 million with little increase in benefits. Second, ROO <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Tri-Party Agreement <b>Amendment</b> <b>to</b> require low-level waste samples be analyzed within 25 miles of Hanford. ROO estimated that the 25 -mile restriction will require an additional $ 46 million over an 8 -year period. It is recommended that DOE (1) notify the appropriate parties that characterization of the high-level radioactive waste tanks will be completed in the most cost-effective method to achieve program objectives, and (2) negotiate to remove the requirement to perform 80 % of low-level waste sample analyses within 25 miles of Hanford.
