500|$|Internationalist was {{recorded}} at Melbourne's Sing Sing Studios, with Powderfinger accompanied by American producer Nick DiDia {{for the first}} time. As the band had already prepared [...] "about 30 or 40" [...] songs when they entered the studio, DiDia's task was relatively minor. Bassist John Collins said of DiDia; [...] "Nick was really good. The way Nick based the record was {{that he wanted to}} record the band how we were <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> moment, he didn't want to play around too much." [...] As a result of this attitude, the band only spent one month in the studio, and the album was mixed by DiDia soon after.

500|$|Soon {{after its}} release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, {{and moved to}} Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers in the {{development}} of soundtracks for film. The loss of his key mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake to further retreat into depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered that [...] "Nick was monosyllabic. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> gig he was very shy.

He has also drawn attention to the scene in which Graham visits Lecktor in his cell, pointing out the constant position of the cell bars within the frame, even as the shots cut {{back and forth between}} the two characters. [...] "There is nothing in Manhunter ... which is just a nice shot", says Spinotti. [...] " [...] is all focused into conveying that particular atmosphere; whether it's happiness, or delusion, or disillusion".

500|$|In Westminster Corporation v. London and North Western Railway Co.

London and North Western Railway Company, which owned property fronting Parliament Street and Bridge Street, objected to the construction. Lord Macnaghten considered whether the Corporation had constructed the subway [...] "as a means of crossing the street under colour and pretence of providing public conveniences which were not really wanted <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> place", which would not have been authorized by statute. He concluded that the Corporation's primary object had been to construct the public conveniences, together with proper means of approaching and exiting from them.
