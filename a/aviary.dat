5|$|The <b>aviary</b> at Tyntesfield is {{situated}} {{to the west}} of the house, adjacent to the footings of the old conservatory. It was built in 1880 to house exotic birds, but was converted into a playhouse for Doreen, the first Lord Wraxall's daughter. The <b>aviary</b> is considered one of the most distinctive features of the estate, and is Grade II listed.|$|E
5|$|In captivity, {{domestic}} ducks come in wild-type plumages, white, {{and other}} colours. Most of these colour variants are also known in domestic mallards not bred as livestock, but kept as pets, <b>aviary</b> birds, etc., {{where they are}} rare but increasing in availability.|$|E
5|$|The red wattlebird {{has been}} kept as an <b>aviary</b> bird in Sydney. It is not {{difficult}} to look after but can be very aggressive to other cage birds. Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' is a useful companion shrub as it bears flowers all year round.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} subcategories of home aviaries: {{grounded}} <b>aviaries</b> and suspended <b>aviaries.</b> Grounded <b>aviaries</b> are affixed {{to the ground with}} a concrete base to prevent rats and other vermin from entering. Suspended <b>aviaries</b> are suspended in the air with only the 'legs' of the <b>aviaries</b> affixed to the ground; hence, the need for a protective base is eliminated in suspended <b>aviaries.</b> Most grounded <b>aviaries</b> typically feature a woodwork or PVC frame unlike the metal frame of public aviaries; however, it isn't uncommon for suspended <b>aviaries</b> to feature a metal frame.|$|R
50|$|The Park {{also still}} {{contains}} several <b>aviaries</b> built for Thomas Powys, 4th Baron Lilford, a prominent ornithologist. The 7th Baron Lilford restocked the <b>aviaries</b> around 1970, containing more than 350 birds of 110 species, {{and opened the}} Park to the public.|$|R
50|$|Set in a {{landfilled}} and landscaped former quarry, {{the park}} includes several natural waterfalls. Paths for visitors wind through three <b>aviaries</b> and past other <b>aviaries</b> and open exhibits. A viewing {{window in the}} nursery lets visitors see how the birds are hatched and raised.|$|R
5|$|Although their ranges overlap substantially, {{hybridisation}} between goldcrests and firecrests {{seems to}} be prevented by differences in courtship rituals and different facial patterns. Even in <b>aviary</b> studies in which a female goldcrest was given an artificial eyestripe to facilitate mating with a male firecrest, the chicks were never raised by the mixed pair, {{and appeared to be}} poorly adapted compared to the parent species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aviary</b> {{experiments}} {{conducted with}} captive flocks of scaly-breasted munia have tested whether producers and scroungers reach the predicted stable equilibrium frequency (see Evolutionarily stable strategy) when individuals {{are free to}} choose either behavior. The numbers choosing either producers and scrounger strategies {{have been shown to}} converge on stable frequencies while demonstrating that variation in tactics arise through frequency dependent pay-offs from the choice of different feeding strategies.|$|E
5|$|Birdy {{builds a}} new <b>aviary</b> {{in his bedroom}} and {{purchases}} two canaries. He names the female Perta and the male Alfonso after his friend. Upon returning to school, Birdy encounters a classmate, Doris Robinson, and Al encourages him to ask her out on a date. At the prom, Birdy dances unenthusiastically with Doris, leaving her confused and humiliated. Afterwards, Doris drives him to a secluded spot, where Birdy lightly rejects her sexual advances. Birdy returns home to his bedroom and lies down naked in the <b>aviary.</b> In a semi-conscious state, he expresses {{that he wants to}} die and be born again as a bird. He then imagines himself flying like a bird around his room, throughout the house and outside in the neighborhood.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} <b>aviaries</b> behind Damascene Hall {{that were once}} used for Pheasantry when Wilhelma was still a palace for the King of WÃ¼rttemberg. In the post war period, these were used for housing small predatory animals {{including}} Canines, small cats, and civets. Since {{the restoration of the}} <b>aviaries</b> in the 1990s, they now hold native birds such as partridges, Eurasian bullfinchs, sparrows, and various pigeon species. In 2015, a modification was made to these <b>aviaries</b> to house capercaillies for Wilhelma's in situ participation of Species protection in the Black Forest region.|$|R

50|$|The {{northern}} quadrant of {{the site}} contains {{a number of significant}} structures, artefacts and plantings. <b>Aviaries</b> and an adjacent vine arbour are a popular feature of the gardens, housing a variety of native parrots and farm birds. Behind the <b>aviaries</b> is the relocated and altered curators cottage (c.1878 and 1934). North of the <b>aviaries</b> past a herb garden is the secluded rose garden, which is enclosed on one side by columns transferred from the original Townsville Town Hall. This layout is a copy of the early twentieth century formal garden and includes the moulded terrazzo urn (1957) as the central focus.|$|R
5|$|Cockatoos are a {{distinctive}} lineage of parrots notable for their crests {{and lack of}} colour in their plumage. Generally large and noisy, they are a familiar part of the Australian (and Tasmanian) landscape. Six species are found in Tasmania, {{two of which are}} considered to be <b>aviary</b> escapees and hence introduced and one a vagrant.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{suspects}} that the raptors {{are searching for}} something while observing two of them communicating. He becomes ambushed and cornered by the raptors, but is rescued by Eric, who managed to survive in an overturned water truck. The next day, Grant and Eric hear Paul's satellite phone ringing and are reunited with the Kirbys and Billy. Paul explains that he gave the phone to Nash before he was devoured, before the group is attacked by the Spinosaurus. After the group escapes, Grant discovers Billy took two raptor eggs to use for funding, which provoked the raptor attacks. He decides to keep the eggs to ensure the group's survival. The group unknowingly enters a large <b>aviary</b> used to house Pteranodons, which attack the group and fly away with Eric. Billy rescues Eric by using Ben's parasail, but is then attacked and seemingly killed by the Pteranodons. The {{rest of the group}} escapes the <b>aviary,</b> unintentionally leaving the door unlocked. They make their way downriver using a boat.|$|E
5|$|Green rosellas were {{regularly}} captured and kept as pets {{until the early}} 20th century. The species {{is reported to be}} hardier and easier to keep in captivity than other rosellas. However, it is not a popular bird in the <b>aviary</b> trade, possibly on account of its subdued colours. Like most species of parrots, the green rosella is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal. The species has a reputation for being apathetic and vulnerable to weight gain in captivity; hence it is recommended to be kept in a large <b>aviary</b> of at least 5m (15ft) long to keep it active, and to be fed little or no sunflower seeds. As it breeds late in the season, chicks are often small in the heat of summer and can suffer as a result.|$|E

5|$|Keeping blue-faced {{honeyeaters}} in an <b>aviary</b> in New South Wales {{requires a}} Class 2 Licence. Applicants must show they have appropriate housing, {{and at least}} two years' experience of keeping birds. Blue-faced honeyeaters are exhibited at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, Philadelphia Zoo, and Birmingham Zoo (Alabama) in the United States, Chessington Zoo in England, Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland and Taronga Zoo in Sydney, Australia.|$|E
5|$|Opened in 2011, Brilliant Birds is a {{walk-through}} <b>aviary</b> housing {{several species}} of exotic birds, including Nicobar pigeons, Bali starlings, lilac-breasted rollers, chestnut-backed thrush, and Victoria crowned pigeons. A selection of amphibians, invertebrates and fish are also displayed in the building's main entrance hall, including axolotl, blue poison dart frogs, mudskippers, figure 8 pufferfish, banded archerfish, blind cave fish, and a colony of leafcutter ants.|$|E
50|$|Dotted {{around the}} Central Valley {{are a number}} of <b>aviaries</b> which house a {{selection}} of birds from different parts of the world. The <b>aviaries</b> are specialised to reflect habitat the birds should become adapted to should they be released back into the wild. They are large enough for them to fly short distances, or search the ground for food.|$|R
50|$|Of the {{approximately}} 400 animal species, about 330 are birds; the third highest bird diversity of any zoo that primarily focuses on this animal group (only Weltvogelpark Walsrode and Jurong Bird Park are above). The {{vast majority of}} the birds in the park are exhibited in walk-through <b>aviaries.</b> In total there are more than 100 <b>aviaries.</b>|$|R

5|$|Since Darwin was {{enthusiastic}} about the idea, Wallace asked the Entomological Society of London to test the hypothesis. In response, the entomologist John Jenner Weir conducted experiments with caterpillars and birds in his <b>aviary,</b> and in 1869 he provided the first experimental evidence for warning coloration in animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{nestling}} period also {{varies by}} species size, with larger species having longer nestling periods. It is also affected by season {{and environmental factors}} and by competition with siblings in species with clutch sizes greater than one. Much {{of what is known}} about the nestling period of some species is dependent on <b>aviary</b> studiesâ <b>aviary</b> cockatiels can fledge after 5weeks and the large palm cockatoos after 11weeks. During this period, the young become covered in juvenile plumage while remaining in the hollow. Wings and tail feathers are slow to grow initially but more rapid as the primary feathers appear. Nestlings quickly reach about 80â90% of adult weight about two thirds of the time through this period, plateauing before they leave the hollow; they fledge at this weight with wing and tail feathers still to grow a little before reaching adult dimensions. Growth rate of the young, as well as numbers fledged, are adversely impacted by reduced food supply and poor weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|Under Irwin's leadership, the {{operations}} grew {{to include the}} zoo, the television series, the Steve Irwin Conservation Foundation (later renamed Wildlife Warriors), and the International Crocodile Rescue. Improvements to the Australia Zoo include the Animal Planet Crocoseum, the rainforest <b>aviary</b> and Tiger Temple. Irwin mentioned that he was considering opening an Australia Zoo in Las Vegas, Nevada, and possibly at other sites around the world.|$|E

5|$|BuroHappold's early {{projects}} {{ranged from}} designing giant fabric umbrellas for Pink Floyd concerts to the Munich <b>Aviary</b> and the Mannheim Multihalle, both with Frei Otto, an architect who repeatedly worked with Buro Happold on projects which pioneered lightweight structures. The Mannheim Multihalle was a timber gridshell of 50 by 50mm lathes of hemlock of irregular form, {{depending on the}} elasticity of spring washers at the joints for its flexible form. It {{was one of the}} first major uses of structural gridshells.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, a {{paramyxovirus}} {{with some}} antigenic similarity to Newcastle disease was {{isolated from the}} brain of a turquoise parrot in the Netherlands. That year, many <b>aviary</b> species including several species of Australian parrot {{and members of the}} genus Neophema had exhibited neurological symptoms reminiscent of Newcastle disease. Like other members of the genus, the turquoise parrot is highly sensitive to avian paramyxovirus infection. It is one of many species of parrot that can host the nematode Ascaridia platyceri.|$|E
5|$|Belle Vue Zoological Gardens {{was a large}} zoo, {{amusement}} park, exhibition hall {{complex and}} speedway stadium in Belle Vue, Manchester, England, opened in 1836. The brainchild of John Jennison, the gardens were initially intended to be an entertainment for the genteel middle classes, with formal gardens and dancing on open-air platforms during the summer, but they soon {{became one of the}} most popular attractions in Northern England. Before moving to Belle Vue, Jennison, a part-time gardener, had run a small <b>aviary</b> at his home, the beginnings of the zoo that over the years grew to become the third-largest in the United Kingdom.|$|E
