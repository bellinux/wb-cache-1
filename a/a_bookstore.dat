5|$|According to Jerusalem {{architectural}} historian David Kroyanker, {{the heyday}} of the Downtown Triangle lasted from the early 1930s to the 1970s.

Unlike Israeli stores that sold all kinds of unrelated products under one roof, the Europeans introduced boutiques that featured only one item, such as gloves or ties. Some shops offered unique extras, such as coffeehouses that included an orchestra and dance floor, and <b>a</b> <b>bookstore</b> with a second-floor library.|$|E
