40|$|This master {{thesis is}} about an {{investigation}} of <b>anti-moisture</b> methods for a nonhermeticelectronics enclosure containing a number of printed circuit boards(PCB) {{and placed in a}} severe climatic environment. The relevant theoretical background was provided first. It included the impact of moisture on electronics, some useful psychrometrics concepts, heat transfer fundamentals, introduction of environmental test, temperature and humiditysensing techniques, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling, antimoisture methods and commercial heaters in the current marketing. Then a CFD modelling methodology was developed and validated based on experiment data. An extra heater was added to the enclosure to prevent water adsorption on printed circuit assemblies (PCA) surfaces. The heat dissipation and switch-on period strategies were parametrically studied {{in order to maintain the}} internal relative humidity below 60 % in the vicinity of PCA surfaces, according to the relative humidity control method. In the end, results obtained from the environmental tests and the CFD simulations were presented and analyzed. Conclusions and future work were also discussed...|$|E

Au/gamma-Al 2 O 3 catalysts for low-temperature oxidation of CO {{were prepared}} by depositing C(8) AuNPs in hexane colloidal solution on gamma-Al 2 O 3 using "step-by-step soakage" method and by carrying out vacuum dryness and thermal treatment. For the as-prepared C(8) AuNPs/gamma-Al 2 O 3 catalysts, {{the majority of}} the gold nanoparticles deposited on the support was in a narrow size range of 2 - 3 nm. Even after 600 h of reaction, the gold particles were still in the size range of 2 - 4 nm. The vacuum dryness temperature affected significantly on the particle size, which increased with raising the vacuum dryness temperature. It was found from the evaluation results of catalytic performances that the 2. 5 % (mass fraction, w) Au/gamma-Al 2 O 3 completely converted CO to CO, at - 19 degrees C and maintained the catalytic activity at nearly 100 % CO conversion for at least 900 h at 15 degrees C, and the 4. 0 % (w) Au/gamma-Al 2 O 3 maintained the catalytic activity at nearly 100 % conversion of CO for at least 2000 h {{in the presence of the}} reaction gas containing H 2 O at 15 'C. Evidently, the catalyst had higher activity, good long-term stability and strong <b>anti-moisture</b> performance. The effect of possible factors on the catalytic activity of Au/gamma-Al 2 O 3 was studied based on the above results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. With the {{depletion}} of fossil energy, biology material is {{getting more and more}} attention. Bark, as a kind of renewable resource, need to be utilized urgently and reasonably. The larch bark was very extensive in northeast and the use of larch bark is limited to make tannin. However, the whole process produced much bark residue, which could not be utilized effectively. In this paper, based on the content of total phenolic hydroxyl groups, the in-situ synthesis reaction of the larch bark with formaldehyde was performed in different ratios. FTIR analysis was adopted to characterize the synthesized products. After air-drying, the synthesized product was pressed into a bark-based composite under pressure of 10 ~ 25 MPa. The effect of pressure and molar ratio of phenols and formaldehyde on the properties of the composite were analyzed. These results indicate that, pressure and molar ratio were both vital factors. The composite with higher molar ratio of phenol and formaldehyde had better abilities of <b>anti-moisture,</b> but the molar ratio of 1 : 2 made the strongest composite. With the increasing of pressure, the hardness of the composite was greater. For the composite made under 20 MPa and the molar ratio of 1 : 2, its hardness was 23. 41 MPa and its max load was 415. 83 N. Its thickness and diameter swelling rate of moisture absorption in 12 d was 1. 87 % and 0. 68 %...|$|E
