5|$|Rieve and his {{executive}} officer were both severely criticized {{for failing to}} take all possible steps to save Karlsruhe in a later investigation into the sinking. The report concluded that since the ship was still afloat <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours,</b> and two torpedoes were required to sink her, {{it might have been}} possible to take her under tow back to Kristiansand or another port. In addition, the forward pumps still had power, and so the flooding could have been slowed enough to permit a return to a safe harbor.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Monitor withdrew, Virginia had {{run aground}} {{at which time}} Commander Jones {{came down from the}} spar deck only to find the gun crews not {{returning}} fire. Jones demanded to know why and was briefed by Lieutenant Eggleston that powder was low and precious and given Monitors resistance to shot <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> of battle, maintained that continued firing at that point would only be a waste of ammunition. Virginia soon managed to break away and headed back towards Norfolk, believing that Monitor had withdrawn from battle. Greene, now in command, did not pursue Virginia and, like Worden, was under orders to stay with and protect Minnesota, an action for which he was later criticized.|$|E

5|$|That {{evening the}} North Koreans were {{strongly}} reinforced, attacking the Australian southern flank manned by D Company 3 RAR, and partially penetrating their perimeter. <b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> of fighting the assault was repulsed, and the North Koreans subsequently launched a furious assault against A Company 3 RAR {{on the northern}} position, which also failed amid heavy losses. The following day the Australians advanced to the high ground overlooking Chongju, killing and capturing a number of North Koreans in skirmishes. That afternoon the town itself was cleared by the remaining elements of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade without opposition. North Korean casualties during the fighting were heavy, while Australian losses included their commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Green, who {{was wounded in the}} stomach by artillery fire after the battle and died two days later.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate {{plan was}} for Pillow to push McClernand away and {{take control of}} Wynn's Ferry and Forge Roads, the main routes to Nashville. Buckner was to move his {{division}} across Wynn's Ferry Road and act as rear guard {{for the remainder of}} the army as it withdrew from Fort Donelson and moved east. A lone regiment from Buckner's division—the 30th Tennessee—was designated to stay in the trenches and prevent a Federal pursuit. The attack started well, and <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> of heavy fighting, Pillow's men pushed McClernand's line back and opened the escape route. It was in this attack that Union troops in the West first heard the famous, unnerving rebel yell.|$|E

5|$|Barnes and Morris {{took the}} score to 73 before {{the latter was}} out for 31 <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> of batting. Bradman came in and Yardley set a {{defensive}} field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. The hosts’ captain packed the leg side with fielders and ordered Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Barnes reached his half-century after 135 minutes at the crease with a pull for four from Charlie Barnett. The score progressed to 121 before Barnes cut Jim Laker onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans. The ball bounced away, but the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Umpire Ernest Cooke was unsure of whether Barnes had hit {{the ball into the}} ground before Evans took the catch, and consulted with Chester, who had been standing at point {{on the other side of}} the field, before ruling the batsman out. Keith Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck without further addition to leave Australia's total at 3/121. Australia went on to reach 509 all out on the third day, yielding a 344-run first innings lead.|$|E
5|$|On August 4, Governor General Manuel Macías y Casado sent Colonel Pedro del Pino {{and about}} 220 troops, {{including}} civil guardsmen {{to recapture the}} city. When Colonel Pino entered Fajardo on August 7, he found it nearly deserted because the residents, fearing a battle, had fled to the Fajardo Light and the surrounding hills. At close to midnight on August 8, Pino's troops began their assault on the lighthouse. The landing party of Amphitrite's sailors occupying the lighthouse doused the light and signaled the ships offshore, initiating shore bombardment as the naval guns began firing a protective pattern. <b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours,</b> the Spanish forces retreated back to the town. The Americans suffered no casualties, despite a close call when a wayward naval shell smashed through the 2-foot thick walls of the lighthouse within touch of 6 men but failed to explode. The Spanish losses were 2 dead and 3 wounded, including a lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|As the IX Corps {{gave up on}} Triangle Hill, the PVA 31st Division of the 12th Corps was in {{position}} to take back Sniper Ridge. Under the cover of inclement weather, an assault was launched by the 92nd Regiment at 4pm on November 11. The Chinese soon drove off the defending 1st Battalion of the ROK 32nd Regiment, but Chung Il-kwon immediately replied with a counterattack by the ROK 17th Regiment of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division on the dawn of November 12. <b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> of fighting, the 1st Battalion of the ROK 17th Regiment recaptured two-thirds of Sniper Ridge and inflicted heavy casualties on the PVA 92nd Regiment. The 31st Division relieved the 92nd Regiment with its 93rd Regiment to launch another assault on November 14, but the ROK 17th Regiment responded by committing all units to blunt the attack. By November 17, {{with the help of}} the ROK 1st Field Artillery Group, the ROK 2nd Battalion returned to the 1st Battalion's original position after a two-hour battle. Undeterred by heavy casualties, the PVA 106th Regiment of the 34th Division, 12th Corps relieved the weakened 93rd Regiment during the night of November18. For the next six days, 'seesaw' fighting continued on Sniper Ridge. By November 25, the ROK 2nd Infantry Division was relieved by the ROK 9th Infantry Division on Sniper Ridge and the fighting finally died down.|$|E

5|$|Barnes and Morris {{took the}} score to 73 before {{the latter was}} bowled for 31 by Laker <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> of batting. Morris tried to force a ball from Laker away, but hit it {{from the middle of}} his bat into his back pad, and the ball rebounded onto the stumps. Bradman came in and Yardley set a {{defensive}} field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. The English leader packed the leg side with fielders, including two short legs, and ordered Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Bradman almost inside-edged the second ball onto his stumps, before defending uneasily for a period. With Laker stopping the scoring at the other end, Bradman managed only four runs in his first 20 minutes of batting. The Australian captain regarded Bedser as the finest seam bowler he faced in his career, and he batted in a circumspect manner as he sought to establish himself. At the other end, Bradman misjudged a ball from Laker and an incorrectly executed cut shot narrowly went wide of the slip fielder. Now aged 40, Bradman's reflexes had slowed and he no longer started his innings as confidently as he had done in the past. Barnes then reached his half-century after 135 minutes, pulling Barnett for four, and the Australians passed 100 before lunch after 125 minutes of batting. At the adjournment, the tourists were 104/1.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failed}} counter-attack, South Vietnamese forces in I Corps was further {{weakened}} when President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu pulled the Airborne Division back to Saigon. Now that the South Vietnamese 2nd Infantry Division and the 12th Ranger Group was overstretched between Quảng Ngãi and Hội An, with Tam Kỳ only defended by the ARVN 5th Infantry Regiment and one battalion from the ARVN 4th Infantry Regiment, North Vietnamese General Chu Huy Mân decided to utilise the advantage to capture Tam Kỳ. Beginning at 5:30am on March 21, the North Vietnamese 2nd Division attacked Suoi Da, the last South Vietnamese outpost outside Tam Kỳ. At around 12:00pm, ARVN General Trần Văn Nhựt ordered {{the rest of}} the 4th Infantry Regiment out from Quảng Ngãi in an attempt to hold Tam Kỳ, so South Vietnamese defences in that province was further weakened. Again, taking advantage of the situation, General Chu Huy Mân ordered the 52nd Independent Brigade and the 94th Local Force Regiment to attack Quảng Ngãi. By 7:00am on March 24, the cities of Tam Kỳ and Quảng Ngãi were simultaneously attacked by North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces. In Tam Kỳ, the ARVN 4th and 5th Infantry Regiments were destroyed <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> of heavy fighting, while the 37th and 39th Ranger Battalions (from the ARVN 12th Ranger Group) in {{the outskirts of the city}} simply fled from the battlefield. At 10:00am on March 24, North Vietnamese and Viet Cong soldiers of the 2nd Division, the ‘Ba Gia’ Regiment, and the 31st Regiment successfully captured Tam Kỳ.|$|E
5|$|The {{festivals and}} daily rituals do not adhere to {{standard}} Hindu Agamic or Buddhist rituals. It follows what Paul Younger calls as ancient Vedda traditions of worship. Although since the medieval period Hindus, Buddhists and even Muslims {{have tried to}} co-opt the temple, deity and its worship as their own, the rituals maintained by the native priests are still intact. The main festival known in Sinhalese as Esela Perehera. It is celebrated during the months of July and August. About 45 days before the festival begins, the priests go into the forest and find two forked branches of a sacred tree. The branches are then immersed in the local river and kept at the shrines dedicated to Kataragama deviyo and Vali. When the main festival begins, the Yantra representing the deity is retrieved from its storage location, paraded through a street {{on top of an}} elephant, and carried to the Valli shrine. <b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> it is returned. On {{the last day of the}} festival the Yantra is left overnight at the Valli shrine and brought back to the main shrine. The priests conduct the rituals in silence, covering their mouths with white cloth. Associated with the main festival is fire walking arranged by a master of the ritual. Hundreds of devotees participate in fire walking, yet others participate in ecstatic dance forms called Kavadi and body piercing. Many of the pilgrims exhibit signs of being possessed.|$|E

5|$|After {{four minutes}} of deliberation, the jury's foreman {{announced}} a guilty verdict and {{a sentence of}} death. The trial lasted about one hour. Court officers approached Washington to escort him away, but were pushed aside by a surge of spectators, who seized Washington and dragged him outside. Washington initially fought back, biting one man, but was soon beaten. A chain was placed {{around his neck and}} he was dragged toward city hall by a growing mob; on the way downtown, he was stripped, stabbed, and repeatedly beaten with blunt objects. By the time he arrived at city hall, a group had prepared wood for a bonfire next to a tree in front of the building. Washington, semiconscious and covered in blood, was doused with oil, hung from the tree by a chain, and then lowered to the ground. Members of the crowd cut off his fingers, toes, and genitals. The fire was lit and Washington was repeatedly raised and lowered into the flames until he burned to death. German scholar Manfred Berg posits that the executioners attempted to keep him alive to increase his suffering. Washington attempted to climb the chain, but was unable to, owing to his lack of fingers. The fire was extinguished <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours,</b> allowing bystanders to collect souvenirs from the site of the lynching, including Washington's bones and links of the chain. One attendee kept part of Washington's genitalia; a group of children snapped the teeth out of Washington's head to sell as souvenirs. By the time that the fire was extinguished, parts of Washington's arms and legs had been burned off and his torso and head were charred. His body was removed from the tree and dragged behind a horse throughout the town. Washington's remains were transported to Robinson, where they were publicly displayed until a constable obtained the body late in the day and buried it.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs began 1930 in good form, and, with Rhodes, {{was added}} to the {{selection}} panel again for the Ashes series that season. In the first Test, Hobbs scored 78 and 74; he top-scored in both innings, but failed in the next two Tests. Before the third and fourth Tests, feeling tired and concerned by his form, he offered to stand down but the other selectors declined his suggestion. When he batted in the fourth Test, he shared an opening partnership of 108 with Sutcliffe, their 11th century stand against Australia. <b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> batting, he was out for 31. With the series level at 1–1, the final Test was to be played to a finish, but before it began, Hobbs announced that it would be his last. Shortly after making the decision, he returned to form, scoring a century and passing, in his next game, W. G. Grace's record career-aggregate of 54,896 first-class runs. Before the deciding Test, the selectors sacked Percy Chapman as captain. The press speculated that Hobbs would replace him, but Bob Wyatt was chosen; Hobbs may have turned down an offer of the captaincy at the meeting of selectors. In the match, Hobbs scored 47 in the first innings. When he came out to bat in the second, {{in the face of a}} large Australian first-innings lead, Hobbs was given an ovation by the crowd and the Australian fielders gave him three cheers. Hobbs was moved by his reception but scored only nine runs before he was dismissed, and Australia won the match and series. In his final series, he scored 301 runs at 33.44. In 61 Tests, he had scored 5,410 runs at an average of 56.94. He retired as the leading run-scorer in Test matches, a record he held until it was passed by Wally Hammond in 1937. Maintaining his form for the rest of the season, Hobbs scored 2,103 first-class runs in 1930 at 51.29.|$|E
