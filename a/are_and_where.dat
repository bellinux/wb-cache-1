500|$|This idea {{is further}} {{explored}} in Icke's Remember Who You Are: Remember 'Where' You <b>Are</b> <b>and</b> <b>Where</b> You 'Come' From (2012), where he introduces {{the concept of}} the [...] "Saturn–Moon Matrix". In this more recent conceptualization, the rings of Saturn (which Icke believes were artificially created by reptilian spacecraft) are the ultimate source of the signal, while the Moon functions as an amplifier.|$|E

When the Sci-Fi Channel was launched, the first broadcast was a dedication to two [...] "science fiction pioneers": Isaac Asimov and Roddenberry. The Roddenberry crater on Mars is named after him, as is the asteroid 4659 Roddenberry. Roddenberry and Star Trek have been cited as inspiration for other science fiction franchises, with George Lucas crediting the series for enabling Star Wars to be produced. J.

500|$|Before the album's release, Williams {{spoke about}} his {{hopes for the}} album: [...] "I want people to feel elated, I want them to dance, I want them to forget about who they <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> they are for 50 minutes – and, within those 50 minutes of [...] forgetting who they are, I also hope people relate to the songs. This is a record that I’m very proud of – I think it’s fucking brilliant. I {{want it to be}} the record that, if people think of Robbie Williams, they go, Yeah, Reality Killed the Video Star." [...] He also talked about his {{collaboration}} with producer Trevor Horn: [...] "He’s added something to the record that I haven’t had on previous records – his genius".|$|E
500|$|MDOT has {{indicated}} {{that it has not}} requested jurisdiction, but rather if it assumed control of the route, the community would need to support a through-route. Several proposals have arisen, including creating a [...] "spur" [...] from US41/M-28 through the east end of Ishpeming to meet CR480 west of Negaunee. This spur would pass through recently reopened former mining [...] "caving grounds", and to the south of the Mather A & B Mine complex. According to Gerry Corkin, Marquette County Board Chairman, [...] "the land that was purchased by Ishpeming and Negaunee, the mining company land, this has the potential to help in the development of that if this is compatible. I think both cities will be interested in taking a look at what the land uses <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> this [...] would push through." ...|$|E

The line [...] "Daddy, I'm so sorry, I'm so s-s-sorry, yeah", according to Gaga, was inspired by [...] "rich kids" [...] in the area who she would hear calling their parents for money to buy drugs with. She added that [...] "ultimately what I want people to take from it is 'Bang-bang.' No matter who you <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> you come from, you can feel beautiful and dirty rich." ...|$|E

500|$|Ty Burr of the Boston Globe {{gave the}} film a perfect four star rating, {{describing}} it as [...] "ridiculously satisfying", and the [...] "best prequel ever". Burr praised the character {{development in the}} film, opining that [...] "emotionally, Star Trek hits every one of its marks, functioning as a family reunion that extends across decades, entertainment mediums, even blurring the line between audience and show." [...] He continued: [...] "Trading on affections sustained over 40 years of popular culture, Star Trek does what a franchise reboot rarely does. It reminds us why we loved these characters in the first place." [...] Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly gave the film an 'A-' grade, commenting that director Abrams [...] "crafts an origin story that avoids any hint of the origin doldrums." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, who gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 stars. He felt that the acting from the cast was {{the highlight of the}} filming, asserting that the performance of Pine radiated star quality. Likewise, Travers called Quinto's performance [...] "sharp" [...] and [...] "intuitive", and felt that Quinto [...] "gave the film a soul". Manohla Dargis of the New York Times wrote, [...] "Star Trek [...] isn’t just a pleasurable rethink of your geek uncle's favorite science-fiction series. It's also a testament to television's power as mythmaker, as a source for some of the fundamental stories we tell about ourselves, who we <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> we came from. Slate Dana Stevens felt that the film was [...] "a gift {{to those of us who}} loved the original series, that brainy, wonky, idealistic body of work that aired to almost no commercial success between 1966–69 and has since become a science fiction archetype and object of cult adoration." [...] Time Out London Tom Huddleston praised the aesthetic qualities of the film, such as the design of Enterprise, and praised the performances of the cast. He wrote, [...] "The cast are equally strong: Quinto brings wry charm to an otherwise calculating character, while Pine powers through his performance in bullish, if not quite Shatner-esque fashion." ...|$|E

Carter says the book's objective is permanent peace for Israel and its neighbors; it’s something the former president says he’s dedicated his entire adult life to.|$|E

2500|$|Theron Martin of Anime News Network {{labelled}} the [...] "Hestia Factor" [...] {{as one of}} {{the reasons}} for DanMachis success, citing Inori Minase's voice acting, character development, as well as relationship with Bell. In a review of the series' first novel, Martin further wrote that [...] "Fujino Ōmori's writing skill is actually higher than average [...] By the end of the novel we have a very good sense of who most of the major players <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> they stand, especially Bell and Hestia." [...] iDigitalTimes, in a review of the DanMachi anime, found the relationship between Bell and Hestia to be [...] "really touching", writing [...] "she obviously loves him and wants to be with him, not simply as patron goddess but as a lover. Bell’s ignorance to her every overture is a grating genre standard, but his trademark obliviousness lessens Hestia’s love for Bell not a whit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Behe testified on {{the morning}} of 2005-10-17, day 10 of the trial, that [...] "...Intelligent Design is a {{scientific}} theory." [...] But in his 2005-10-18 afternoon testimony, during cross-examination, Behe said that his definition of a scientific theory is not standard and would allow both the long-disproved ether theory of light (idea of luminiferous aether) and astrology to be classified as scientific theories. Since the standard definition of a scientific theory includes [...] "... a well-substantiated explanation...", Behe’s personal definition would allow for disproved ideas to be considered scientific theories, whereas the standard definition does not. Behe defended his version of the definition of scientific theory as being one that is commonly used among scientists. Who these scientists <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> they use the Behe definition was not clarified. But Behe's employer, Lehigh University, in an undated proclamation, stated the department faculty’s unequivocal support for evolution and [...] "... It is our collective position that intelligent design has no basis in science..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bill was {{enthusiastic}} about his experience; {{he felt it}} helped him eliminate many barriers erected by the self, or ego, that {{stand in the way}} of one's direct experience of the cosmos and of God. He thought he might have found something that could make a big difference to the lives of many who still suffered. Bill is quoted as saying: [...] "It is a generally acknowledged fact in spiritual development that ego reduction makes the influx of God's grace possible. If, therefore, under LSD [...] we can have a temporary reduction, so that we can better see what we <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> we are going — well, that might be of some help. The goal might become clearer. So I consider LSD to be of some value to some people, and practically no damage to anyone. It will never take the place of any of the existing means by which we can reduce the ego, and keep it reduced." [...] Wilson felt that regular usage of LSD in a carefully controlled, structured setting would be beneficial for many recovering alcoholics. However, he felt this method only should be attempted by individuals with well-developed super-egos.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{studies of}} alcoholics who {{underwent}} LSD treatment reported a 50% success rate after a single high-dose session. However, {{the studies that}} reported high success rates had insufficient controls, lacked objective measures of genuine change, and failed to conduct rigorous follow-up interviews with subjects. The lack of conclusive evidence notwithstanding, individual case reports are often dramatic. Bill Wilson, the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous conducted medically supervised experiments in the 1950s {{on the effects of}} LSD on alcoholism. Bill is quoted as saying [...] "It is a generally acknowledged fact in spiritual development that ego reduction makes the influx of God's grace possible. If, therefore, under LSD we can have a temporary reduction, so that we can better see what we <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> we are going—well, that might be of some help. The goal might become clearer. So I consider LSD to be of some value to some people, and practically no damage to anyone. It will never take the place of any of the existing means by which we can reduce the ego, and keep it reduced." [...] Wilson felt that regular usage of LSD in a carefully controlled, structured setting would be beneficial for many recovering alcoholics. However, he felt this method only should be attempted by individuals with well-developed super-egos. In 1957 Wilson wrote a letter to Heard saying: [...] "I am certain that the LSD experiment has helped me very much. I find myself with a heightened colour perception and an appreciation of beauty almost destroyed by my years of depressions." [...] Most AA members were strongly opposed to his experimenting with a mind-altering substance.|$|E
