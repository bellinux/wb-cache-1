5|$|<b>A</b> <b>two-minute</b> minor {{penalty is}} often called for lesser infractions such as slashing, tripping, elbowing, roughing, too many players, illegal equipment, holding, or interference. Five-minute major {{penalties}} are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, {{as well as for}} fighting. Players are released from the penalty box when either the penalty time expires, or the opposition scores a goal (or three goals for the instance of a major penalty).|$|E

5|$|At the April 2017 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo, a film {{adaptation}} was announced. It will be co-written by Seeley and Sarah Fischer, {{directed by}} Luke Boyce and produced by Shatterglass Films, an independent film {{company based in}} Champaign, Illinois. Larger production firms also expressed interest, but Seeley would have had less input into the film if it were made by them. Boyce said he had enjoyed Revival since its debut, and {{had been thinking about}} adapting it long before he met the creators. <b>A</b> <b>two-minute</b> proof of concept teaser was shown at the expo.|$|E
5|$|On {{the fourth}} orbit, {{drifting}} in an inverted spacecraft with the Earth 'above' him, Schirra continued his photography and attempted—unsuccessfully—to spot the Echo 1 satellite while passing over East Africa. As he approached California, he spoke briefly to John Glenn in <b>a</b> <b>two-minute</b> conversation broadcast live across the United States {{on radio and}} television. Problems began to recur with the pressure suit, with water condensing on the faceplate; Schirra, concerned about the internal temperature, avoided opening the visor to clean it for fear that the suit temperature would misbehave again.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Anderson tallied 48 {{goals and}} 56 assists {{for a total}} of 104 points to help the Oilers remain atop their division. In the playoffs, the Oilers managed to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals {{for the first time in}} franchise history. Anderson and his team were matched up against the Islanders who were looking for a fourth consecutive Stanley Cup victory. During the Finals, Anderson had several noted run-ins with Islanders goaltender Billy Smith. During game one, a slash on Anderson's knee earned Smith <b>a</b> <b>two-minute</b> slashing penalty.|$|E

Two weeks after {{returning}} to Canada, he accepted an invitation from the International Wrestling Association of Japan (IWA Japan). While in Japan, he achieved his dream of wrestling in Tokyo's Korakuen Hall. Three months later, World Championship Wrestling was taping WCW Thunder in Kelowna, British Columbia and recruited Juggernaut and three other local wrestlers for a match. They faced KroniK in a handicap match with <b>a</b> <b>two-minute</b> time limit. KroniK won the match in one minute and forty-nine seconds, pinning Juggernaut after performing the High Times.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{characters}} returned for Hasbro's new toyline, which was released on May 16, 2011. In October 2010, Entertainment Tonight previewed the behind-the-scenes filming in Chicago. <b>A</b> <b>two-minute</b> teaser trailer was announced on November 27, and was posted to the Internet on December 9, 2010. A 30-second television advertisement for the film aired during Super Bowl XLV on Fox on February 6, 2011. The first full theatrical trailer was released on April 28, 2011.

5|$|On {{completion}} of the pitch bible, Hasbro and Faust began looking at studios for the animation. Studio B Productions (renamed to DHX Media on September 8, 2010, after its parent company, along with DHX's other subsidiaries) had previously worked on Macromedia Flash-based animations and on shows that featured {{a large number of}} animals, and Faust felt they would be a good selection. Studio B requested that Jayson Thiessen be the director, a choice Faust agreed with. She, Thiessen, and James Wootton led the {{completion of}} <b>a</b> <b>two-minute</b> short to pitch the final product to Hasbro, resulting in the company's sanctioning the full production. Faust estimates that from being initially asked to develop the show until this point took roughly one year.|$|E

5|$|The Cenotaph {{was opened}} by General John Seely {{at a public}} {{ceremony}} on 6 November 1920 that included the playing of the Last Post and <b>a</b> <b>two-minute</b> silence. Kimber was very pleased with both the project and Lutyens, and he hoped to build a second war memorial in Southampton using the architect, although this project never came to fruition. The Southampton Cenotaph was influential in later designs for war memorials both in England and abroad; {{it was the first}} such cenotaph to be built and simpler versions of the same design were widely used to commemorate the First World War, including famously at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London.|$|E
5|$|The {{funerals}} {{were held}} in Scotland with John and Joseph McCaig buried together in Ayr. Their older brother, serving with the Royal Marines in Singapore, was flown home for the service. That day, 20,000 people attended rallies in Belfast and Carrickfergus. In Belfast, the cenotaph at the City Hall {{was the focus of}} the mourning with 10,000 people attending including workers from factories in a gathering that stopped the traffic in the city centre. Many wept openly. The Reverend Ian Paisley led the mourners in laying dozens of wreaths. The crowd observed <b>a</b> <b>two-minute</b> silence and sang a hymn and the national anthem.|$|E
5|$|A third game {{entitled}} Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse {{was confirmed}} in May 2008 for release in 2009; {{the title was}} later pushed back to 2010, with concept art emerging after Telltale's completion of Tales of Monkey Island. The season again ran for five episodes, released monthly from April to August 2010. The Devil's Playhouse followed a structure similar to Tales of Monkey Island, with each episode forming a {{part of an ongoing}} narrative, involving psychic powers and forces that would use them for world domination. <b>A</b> <b>two-minute</b> Flash cartoon also accompanied the game, dealing with the origin story of General Skun-ka'pe, one of the game's antagonists. Max also appears in Telltale's 2010 casual game Poker Night at the Inventory alongside Tycho Brahe from Penny Arcade, the Heavy from Team Fortress 2 and Strong Bad from Homestar Runner. Sam and Max (now voiced by Dave Boat) also appear in the game's sequel alongside Claptrap from Borderlands, Brock Samson from The Venture Bros., Ash Williams from Evil Dead and GLaDOS from Portal.|$|E

5|$|The film used Technicolor's Oz process during post-production. This is {{a partial}} silver {{retention}} on the interpositive, similar to bleach bypass, {{which will be}} used to lend to the sense of detachment from the modern world McG was looking for. Industrial Light & Magic developed shader programs to make the desaturated lighting of the CGI realistic and well-integrated to the on-set footage. The filmmakers consulted with many scientists about the effects of an abandoned world and nuclear winter. McG cited , the original Star Wars trilogy and Children of Men, as well as the novel The Road, as his visual influences. He instructed his cast to read the latter as well as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Like Children of Men, McG would storyboard scenes so that it would be edited together to resemble a seamless, continuous shot. It took two weeks to film <b>a</b> <b>two-minute</b> shot of Connor getting caught up in a bombing on the Skynet base where he discovers plans for the T-800.|$|E
5|$|The system {{operates}} continually (24/7) with a varying headway {{throughout the}} day. During rush hour (07:00–10:00 and 15:00–18:00), there is <b>a</b> <b>two-minute</b> headway {{on the common}} section and a four-minute headway on the single-service sections. During Thursday through Saturday night (0:00–05:00), there is a seven/eight-minute headway on the common section and a fifteen-minute headway on the single-service sections, and other nights it is twenty minutes on all sections of the metro. At all other times, there is a three-minute headway on the common section and a six-minute on the split sections. Travel time from Nørreport to Vestamager on M1 is 14 minutes, to the airport on M2 is 15 minutes, and to Vanløse on M1 and M2 is 9 minutes. In 2009, the metro transported 50million passengers, or 137,000 per day; by 2013, the metro's ridership increased to 55million.|$|E
5|$|York {{achieved}} {{their first}} away win {{of the season}} after beating bottom-of-the-table Newport County 3–0. Berrett opened the scoring {{in the first half}} with a shot into the bottom corner, and in the second half Thompson scored a header before Oliver scored with a close-range finish. York drew 2–2 away to Stevenage, and took the lead in the 39th minute with a Nolan shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty area. Chris Whelpdale and Charlie Lee scored for Stevenage in quick succession early in the second half, and Summerfield equalised with a curling shot on 74 minutes, before Flinders saved a late Brett Williams penalty. Striker Rhys Turner joined on a one-month loan from Oldham Athletic, and made his debut in York's 2–2 home draw with Carlisle United. York were 2–0 down at half-time, before Oliver was sent off for an off-the-ball incident early in the second half. However, within <b>a</b> <b>two-minute</b> period, Summerfield scored a penalty and Carson converted an Emile Sinclair cross to bring the score to 2–2.|$|E

5000|$|World Nunchaku Association (WNA): Founded by Milco Lambrecht in the Netherlands in 1996. WNA uses {{yellow and}} black plastic weight-balanced {{training}} nunchaku and protective headgear. They {{have their own}} belt color system, in which participants earn color stripes on the belt, instead of fully colored belts. One side of the belt is yellow and the other black, so that in a competition, opponents may be distinguished by the visible side of the belt. WNA fight rules correspond to the kumite subsection of Nunchaku-do discipline. It is <b>a</b> <b>two-minutes</b> [...] "touch fight," [...] in which technical abilities are very important. After each scored point, the fight stops and the fighters take back their starting position.|$|R
5|$|Since postseason games cannot {{end in a}} tie, {{unlike the}} preseason or regular season, {{additional}} overtime periods are played as necessary until a winner is determined. Furthermore, all clock rules apply as if a game had started over. Therefore, if the first overtime period ends with the score still tied, the teams switch ends of the field prior to double overtime. If a game was still tied with two minutes to go in double overtime, there would be <b>a</b> <b>two-minute</b> warning (but not during the first overtime period as in the regular season). And if it were still tied {{at the end of}} double overtime, there would be a kickoff to start triple overtime. Although a contest could theoretically last indefinitely, or last multiple overtime periods like several National Hockey League postseason games, no NFL playoff game has ever gone into triple-overtime. The longest NFL game played to date is 82 minutes, 40 seconds: Miami Dolphins kicker Garo Yepremian made the winning 37-yard field goal after 7:40 of double-overtime to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs, 27–24, in the 1971–72 NFL playoffs on December 25, 1971.|$|E
5|$|Upfront, the No. 5 Toyota {{increased}} its lead over the No. 8 Audi to 38.778 seconds, {{while the first}} Audi moved into 12th position. The No. 1 Porsche returned to the pit lane {{for a change of}} front axel and fell down the order in LMP1 because of different tyre speeds of the vehicle's front wheels. G-Drive's No. 38 entry was issued with <b>a</b> <b>two-minute</b> stop-and-go penalty for its role in the collision with the No. 95 Aston Martin. Fässler nearly placed Davidson into the grass at Stavelot while lapping Extreme Speed Motorsports's Ligier. Fässler entered the pit lane for replacement front bodywork. Gulf's Porsche entry spun after contact with Emmanuel Collard's Ferrari at Rivage. The second full course caution was later necessitated when debris was located on three sections of the track. Davidson remained the leader at the restart, ahead of Duval, and immediately increased his advantage over the Audi driver. The No. 7 car hit the No. 36 Alpine at La Source, causing the latter to spin. The third round of pit stops commenced shortly afterwards when Audi and Toyota made their stops for fuel and driver changes. Kraihamer's No. 13 Rebellion Racing vehicle hit the LMP2 leader Tor Graves in the No. 44 Manor Oreca and his car was beached on La Source's apex {{for a long period of}} time before rejoining the event.|$|E
5|$|With 2:05 {{left in the}} game, Cutler began leading <b>a</b> <b>two-minute</b> drill: after a six-yard run by Forte, {{followed}} by a sack by Mack and incomplete pass to Josh Bellamy to bring up fourth down, Cutler successfully converted with a seven-yard pass to Bennett, who beat Keenan Lambert. Cutler's next pass to Marquess Wilson fell incomplete, and Forte's seven-yard run led to another third-down situation, which led to Cutler's first-down conversion of seven yards to Wilson with 56 seconds left. On {{the next set of}} downs, Cutler's pass for receiver Cameron Meredith was overthrown, though a 12-yard pass to Royal allowed the offense to enter Oakland territory, where the Bears elected to use a timeout with 40 seconds remaining. The offense entered field goal range with Cutler's nine-yard pass to Wilson, {{followed by}} a two-yard run by Forte. With seven seconds left, the Bears used another timeout, and allowed Gould to attempt the 49-yard field goal; Gould successfully converted the field goal with two seconds remaining on the clock to give the Bears the 22–20 lead. In an last-second attempt to score, the Raiders attempted lateral passes on the kickoff return, but were penalized for an illegal lateral {{in the early stages of}} the play, and the Bears eventually recovered to clinch the win.|$|E
