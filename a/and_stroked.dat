METHOD: Using {{data from the}} Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS), we collected dietary vitamin D data from 5, 995 participants and serum (25) OH vitamin D from 1, 606 participants. The {{association of}} vitamin D with prevalent heart attack <b>and</b> <b>strokes</b> was studied using an unconditional logistic regression model. Then, incidence of heart attack <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> was prospectively studied using a log binomial model. RESULTS: In the analysis of prevalence, a non-significant inverse relationship between vitamin D and heart attack <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> was observed. However, participants in the highest quartile of dietary vitamin D reported significantly fewer prevalent strokes than men in the lowest quartile (prevalence ratio, 0. 72; p= 0. 04). In the incidence analysis, the data was largely inconclusive. In the dietary vitamin D analyses, the highest quartile dietary vitamin D was generally associated with a non-significant decreased odds of heart attack (odds ratio, 0. 98; p= 0. 91) <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> (odds ratio 0. 97; p= 0. 98).
