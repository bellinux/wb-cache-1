40|$|This paper {{entitled}} Virtual Classroom System {{is mainly}} for all educational colleges such as engineering colleges, medical colleges, pharmacy colleges and others {{where there is}} connection between faculty, student and courses. In colleges, sometimes there may be loose connection between faculty, student and courses for some students due to some reason such as missing lectures, doing part time job along with study, distance learning courses; for that, this project help them in an efficient way.
