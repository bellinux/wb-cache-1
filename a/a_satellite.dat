50|$|Part of <b>an</b> {{orbiting}} <b>satellite's</b> broadcast included its precise orbital data. In {{order to}} ensure accuracy, the US Naval Observatory (USNO) continuously observed the precise orbits of these <b>satellites.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>satellite's</b> orbit deviated, the USNO would send the updated information to the satellite. Subsequent broadcasts from <b>an</b> updated <b>satellite</b> would contain its most recent ephemeris.|$|R

50|$|Orbital {{perturbation}} {{analysis is}} {{the activity of}} determining why <b>a</b> <b>satellite's</b> orbit differs from the mathematical ideal orbit. <b>A</b> <b>satellite's</b> orbit in <b>an</b> ideal two-body system describes a conic section, usually an ellipse. In reality, there are several factors that cause the conic section to continually change. These deviations from the ideal Kepler's orbit are called perturbations.|$|R
5|$|ATMOS is {{marketing}} <b>a</b> <b>satellite</b> {{navigation system}} developed by young prodigy Luke Rattigan (Ryan Sampson). The system also reduces {{carbon dioxide emissions}} to zero; UNIT requested the Doctor's help because the technology is not contemporary and might be alien. UNIT are also concerned about fifty-two simultaneous deaths occurring spontaneously several days earlier. The Doctor travels to Rattigan's private school to investigate the system and discovers that the recent events have been plotted by an alien warrior race known as the Sontarans.|$|E
5|$|After being invaded, a queen may {{be forced}} to leave her nest. If <b>a</b> <b>satellite</b> has not been established, the queen may usurp another queen in a {{different}} nest. Thus not having to invest any valuable resources, the queen can then use these resources on reproducing a new brood.|$|E

5|$|Dawson College {{began in}} 1945 as <b>a</b> <b>satellite</b> campus of McGill {{to absorb the}} {{anticipated}} influx of students after World War II. Many students in their first 3 years in the Faculty of Engineering took courses at Dawson College to relieve the McGill campus for the later two years for their degree course. Dawson eventually became independent of McGill and evolved into the first English CEGEP in Quebec. Another CEGEP, John Abbott College, was established in 1971 at the campus of McGill's Macdonald College.|$|E

5|$|GoldenEye 007 closely {{follows the}} plot of the movie, though with some minor alterations. The game starts in Arkhangelsk in the Soviet Union in 1986, where MI6 has {{uncovered}} a secret chemical weapons facility at the Byelomorye Dam. James Bond and fellow 00-agent Alec Trevelyan are sent to infiltrate the facility and plant explosive charges. During the mission, Trevelyan is apparently killed by Colonel Arkady Ourumov, but Bond escapes by commandeering an aeroplane. Five years later in 1991, Bond is sent to investigate <b>a</b> <b>satellite</b> control station in Severnaya, Russia, where programmers Natalya Simonova and Boris Grishenko work. Two years after the Severnaya mission, in 1993, Bond investigates an unscheduled test firing of a missile in Kyrgyzstan, believed to be a cover for the launch of <b>a</b> <b>satellite</b> known as GoldenEye. This space-based weapon works by firing a concentrated electromagnetic pulse at any Earth target to disable any electrical circuit within range. As Bond leaves the silo, he is ambushed by Ourumov and a squad of Russian troops. Ourumov manages to escape during the encounter.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, <b>a</b> <b>satellite</b> detects {{a mysterious}} heat bloom beneath Bouvet√∏ya, an island about one {{thousand}} {{miles off the}} coast of Antarctica. Wealthy industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) discovers through thermal imaging that there is a pyramid buried 2000 feet beneath the ice. He attempts to claim it for his multinational communications company, Weyland Industries, a subsidiary of the Weyland Corporation, and assembles a team of experts to investigate. The team includes archaeologists, linguistic experts, drillers, mercenaries, and a guide named Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan).|$|E

40|$|Consideration of {{the problem}} of {{determining}} the influence of solar heating on the low-frequency dynamic stability of <b>a</b> gravity-gradient <b>satellite.</b> The scope of the effort includes the development of a computer program that uses a quasi-static approach for describing <b>a</b> <b>satellite's</b> unsteady orbital motion. The essential feature of the quasi-static approach is that the satellite's long, slender booms reach their thermal equilibrium position solely as a result of thermal bending without consideration of the dynamic effects of boom vibration. A nonlinear analytical model and a corresponding computer program have been developed to study the effect of absorptivity, sun angle, and hinge stiffness on the stability of <b>a</b> <b>satellite's</b> motion...|$|R
