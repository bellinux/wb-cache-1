With Matt Kemp and Justin Upton added to the Padres' lineup, Black hoped to reduce the pressure on Gyorko to perform. By late April, with Gyorko off to a 7-for-47 (.147) start to the season, he began to lose playing time to Yangervis Solarte, and to Cory Spangenberg in May and June <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> to struggle.|$|E

Eventually, Shama apologised to Sadashiva and offered to present Kanhopatra to him. Kanhopatra, however, fled to Pandharpur disguised as a maid, {{with the help of her}} aged maid Hausa.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rift}} between {{the players and}} Brown and between Modell and Brown grew, Modell fired Brown on January 7, 1963. A {{controversy}} developed over {{the timing of the}} decision amid a local newspaper strike, which limited discussion of the move. A printing company executive, however, got together a group of sportswriters and published a 32-page magazine fielding players' views on the firing. Opinions were mixed; Modell came in for his share of criticism, but tackle and team captain Mike McCormack said he did not think the team could win under Brown. Blanton Collier, Brown's longtime assistant, was named the team's new head coach, and Brown began to plan his next move <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> to receive an $82,500 salary under his eight-year contract.|$|E

The king disliked Pitt because he had previously opposed government policy and attacked measures seen as pro-Hanoverian. In February 1746, Pelham and his followers resigned. George asked Lord Bath and Carteret to form an administration, but after less than 48 hours they returned the seals of office, unable to secure sufficient parliamentary support. Pelham returned to office triumphant, and George was forced to appoint Pitt to the ministry.|$|E

5|$|When Ukraine was {{occupied}} by the Germans in 1942, Brezhnev {{was sent to the}} Caucasus as deputy head of political administration of the Transcaucasian Front. In April 1943, he became head of the Political Department of the 18th Army. Later that year, the 18th Army became part of the 1st Ukrainian Front, as the Red Army regained the initiative and advanced westward through Ukraine. The Front's senior political commissar was Nikita Khrushchev, who had supported Brezhnev's career since the pre-war years. Brezhnev had met Khrushchev in 1931, shortly after joining the Party, and before long, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> his rise through the ranks, he became Khrushchev's protégé.

5|$|Cotto and Judah {{delivered}} an all-action brawl, {{but after}} weathering some difficult early rounds as he figured out Judah's southpaw style and adjusted to his speed, Cotto {{took over the}} bout. In round seven, both fighters went toe-to-toe and in round eight he hurt Judah several times. In round nine, Judah took a knee to gain a breather from Cotto's aggressive style. By the tenth round, Judah was bleeding from a cut over his right eye and was hurt by an uppercut from Cotto that sent him retreating to the ropes, but Judah stayed upright. Early in the eleventh round, Cotto landed a combination that dropped Judah to the canvas. He managed {{to get to his}} feet, but Cotto went after Judah with a relentless attack, turning him sideways along the ropes <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> to throw punches. That forced the referee to stop the fight.|$|E
5|$|Morison {{played the}} opening five {{games of the}} club's 2004–05 campaign, but failed to score. He {{featured}} two more times for the club, scoring Northampton's equaliser away at Darlington in September 2004. The following month, Morison joined Conference South side Bishop's Stortford for an undisclosed fee. He scored on his debut in a 1–1 draw against Redbridge, and scored in the following game in Stortford's 3–1 loss at Bognor Regis Town. He also helped Stortford reach the FA Trophy semi-final and Morison finished the season as the club's top goalscorer, as well as finishing as the 2004–05 FA Trophy top goalscorer. The following season, Morison struggled for form {{at the start of}} the club's league campaign, and was subsequently used as a substitute during the first two months of the season. He started in a game against Histon in November 2005, scoring a hat-trick in a 5–0 win. He followed this up with goals against St Albans City and Eastbourne Borough respectively, as well as scoring Stortford's fourth in a 5–2 victory over Dorchester Town.

5|$|Ryzhkov was {{an early}} {{supporter}} of the Gorbachev policy calling {{for an increase in}} {{the quantity and quality of}} goods planned for production during the period of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (19861990). To achieve these goals, the government pumped money into the machine-building sector but as time went by, Gorbachev increasingly diverged from his original stance. He now wanted to increase overall investment in nearly all industrial sectors; a move which Ryzhkov knew was a budgetary impossibility. However, Ryzhkov's economic policies were not much better <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> to advocate an unreasonable increase in the production of consumer goods. Gorbachev and Ligachev's anti-alcohol campaign was opposed by Ryzhkov, who agreed with the State Planning Committee and the Ministry of Trade that such a drive would deprive from the state billions of rubles in income. Nevertheless, the campaign went ahead, losing the Soviet Government millions in revenues. Ryzhkov's opposition to the campaign was strengthened by his belief that both Gorbachev and Ligachev placed ideology before practical considerations, and he instead advocated an alternative long-term program rather than one designed to have immediate effect.|$|E
5|$|Stoke {{qualified}} for Europe again in 1974–75, {{and managed to}} draw both legs with Dutch side Ajax, only to exit the competition on the away goals rule. However Conroy again struggled with injuries, and was limited to just 16 league appearances. He played most of these games as a centre-forward, as regular striker John Ritchie missed much {{of the season with}} a broken leg and Geoff Hurst was nearing {{the end of his career}} and was unable to play every game. Conroy scored his two career hat-tricks during the campaign, against Halifax Town in the League Cup on 11 September, and then against Carlisle United in a 5–2 league win on 22 March. At the end of the season Stoke had three games to play against mid-table sides and needed to win all three in order to win the league, however they lost at Sheffield United and had goalless draws with Newcastle United and Burnley, leaving the club with another fifth-place finish. Conroy was again limited to just 16 league appearances <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> to suffer injury problems in the 1975–76 season, and underwent an operation to remove all the remaining cartilage from his knees. The club also suffered a disaster, as a strong gale blew a section of the roof off the Victoria Ground's Butler Street Stand on 2 January, and as the correct insurance was not in place the club were forced to sell key players such as Jimmy Greenhoff, Mike Pejic, Alan Hudson, John Mahoney and Geoff Salmons in order to finance stadium repairs.|$|E
