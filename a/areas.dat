5|$|Because of the {{importance}} of tourism to the Croatian economy, <b>areas</b> frequented by tourists (or near major tourist routes) have been given priority for demining.

National parks in Croatia were also demined as top-priority <b>areas,</b> along with <b>areas</b> significant for fire protection. Theft of minefield signs is a significant problem, and is particularly pronounced in <b>areas</b> with concerns among the local population that the signs harm tourism.
