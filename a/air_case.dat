5000|$|On October 2, 2012, it was {{announced}} Tuesday that a second carrier of the now defunct Direct Air was fined for abruptly canceling flights in March that left hundreds of vacationers and other travelers stranded. Xtra Airways was fined $300,000 by the U.S. Department of Transportation because Xtra Airways cancelled flights less than 10 days before departure and for not ensuring a return flight for round-trip passengers {{as required by the}} DOT of such public charter flights. Xtra also violated rules that required them to be paid before operating public charted flights. Xtra stopped flying charters for Direct Air on March 13 when Direct Air failed to pay the carrier all the money it was owed for operating flights that departed on or after March 3, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Xtra also had received late payments from Direct Air for several flights prior to March 3, that should have prompted Xtra to look and see if whether Direct Air was following the federal rules said a DOT Aviation Enforcement Office. The DOT also requires carriers to make a reasonable effort to ensure that the charter operators they fly for are obeying the federal rules. Xtra is the second of Direct Air's eight carriers to be fined by the DOT, with the first one being World Atlantic Airlines which was fined $180,000 in late July. Another one of Direct Air carriers Florida-based Sky King, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, with the companies president telling Lakeland Ledger the bankruptcy filling was led by Direct Air's demise, as Sky King was owed $1 million by the former carrier.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the impacts of {{overshooting}} convection at a local scale on the water distribution in the tropical UTLS. Overshooting convection is assumed to be one of the processes controlling the entry of water vapour mixing ratio in the stratosphere by injecting ice crystals above the tropopause which later sublimate and hydrate the lower stratosphere. For this purpose, we quantify the individual impact of two cases of overshooting convection in Africa observed during SCOUT-AMMA: the case of 4 August 2006 over Southern Chad which is likely to have influenced the water vapour measurements by micro-SDLA and FLASH-B from Niamey on 5 August, and the case of a mesoscale convective system over Aïr on 5 August 2006. We make use of high resolution (down to 1 km horizontally) nested grid simulations with the three-dimensional regional atmospheric model BRAMS (Brazilian Regional Atmospheric Modelling System). In both cases, BRAMS succeeds in simulating the main features of the convective activity, as well as overshooting convection, though the exact position and time of the overshoots indicated by MSG brightness temperature difference is not fully reproduced (typically 1 ° displacement in latitude compared with the overshoots indicated by brightness temperature difference from satellite observations for both cases, and several hours shift for the <b>Aïr</b> <b>case</b> on 5 August 2006). Total water budgets associated with these two events show a significant injection of ice particles above the tropopause with maximum values of about 3. 7 ton s − 1 for the Chad case (4 August) and 1. 4 ton s − 1 for the <b>Aïr</b> <b>case</b> (5 August), and a total upward cross tropopause transport of about 3300 ton h − 1 for the Chad case and 2400 ton h − 1 for the <b>Aïr</b> <b>case</b> in the third domain of simulation. The order of magnitude of these modelled fluxes is lower but comparable with similar studies in other tropical areas based on models. These two estimations exhibit significant differences and highlight variability among the cases of the impact of overshooting convection in hydrating the lower stratosphere. We show that the regional enhancement of water above the tropopause is between 0. 21 to 0. 67 ppmv between 380 and 400 K, generally in the range of other model estimations. The amount of water which remains in the stratosphere after the overshoot is estimated for both cases. A range of 330 to 507 tons is found for the Chad case and an upper limit of 200 tons is found for the <b>Aïr</b> <b>case.</b> Finally we emphasize that the hydrated area in the LS by overshooting convection can be advected relatively far away from the overshoot initial location, with locally mixing ratios of more than 3 ppmv higher than the background level, which is compatible with the balloon borne measurements performed above Niamey in the same air mass, 30 h after the overshoot...|$|E

40|$|A spectrally {{resolved}} discrete-ordinates {{radiative transfer}} model {{is used to}} calculate the change in downwelling surface and top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) outgoing longwave (3. 9 - 500 mum) radiative fluxes induced by tropospheric aerosols of the type observed over the Indian Ocean during the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX). Both external and internal aerosol mixtures were considered. Throughout the longwave, the aerosol volume extinction depends more strongly on relative humidity than in most of the shortwave (0. 28 - 3. 9 mum), implying that particle growth factors and realistic relative humidity profiles {{must be taken into account}} when modeling the longwave radiative effects of aerosols. A typical boundary layer aerosol loading, with a 500 -nm optical depth of 0. 3, will increase the downwelling longwave flux at the surface by 7. 7 W m(- 2) over the clean <b>air</b> <b>case</b> while decreasing the outgoing longwave radiation by 1. 3 W m(- 2). A more vertically extended aerosol loading, exhibiting a high opacity plume between 2 and 3 km above the surface and having a typical 500 -nm optical depth of 0. 7, will increase the downwelling longwave flux at the surface by 11. 2 W m(- 2) over the clean <b>air</b> <b>case</b> while decreasing the outgoing longwave radiation by 2. 7 W m(- 2). For a vertically extended aerosol profile, approximately 30 % of the TOA radiative forcing comes from sea salt and approximately 60 % of the forcing comes from the combination of sea salt and dust. The remaining forcing is from anthropogenic constituents. These results are for the external mixture. For an internal mixture, TOA longwave forcings can be up to a factor of two larger. Therefore, to complete our understanding of this region's longwave aerosol radiative properties, more detailed information is needed about aerosol mixing states. These longwave radiative effects partially offset the large shortwave aerosol radiative forcing and should be included in regional and global climate modeling simulations...|$|E

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} {{coefficients were}} measured using both dry and humid {{air in the}} same forced convection cooling scheme and were compared using appropriate nondimensional parameters (Nusselt, Prandtl and Reynolds numbers). A forced convection scheme with a complex flow field, two dimensional arrays of circular jets with crossflow, was utilized with humidity ratios (mass ratio of water vapor to air) up to 0. 23. The dynamic viscosity, thermal conductivity and specific heat of air, steam and air/steam mixtures are examined. Methods for determining gaseous mixture properties from the properties of their pure components are reviewed as well as methods for determining these properties with good confidence. The need for more experimentally determined property data for humid air is discussed. It is concluded that dimensionless forms of forced convection heat transfer data and empirical correlations based on measurements with dry air may be applied to conditions involving humid air with the same confidence as for the dry <b>air</b> <b>case</b> itself, provided that the thermophysical properties of the humid air mixtures are known with the same confidence as their dry air counterparts...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} moments (MOM) model for the {{analysis}} of the Linearly Tapered Slot Antenna (LTSA) is developed and implemented. The model employs an unequal size rectangular sectioning for conducting parts of the antenna. Piecewise sinusoidal basis functions are used for the expansion of conductor current. The effect of the dielectric is incorporated in the model by using equivalent volume polarization current density and solving the equivalent problem in free-space. The feed section of the antenna including the microstripline is handled rigorously in the MOM model by including slotline short circuit and microstripline currents among the unknowns. Comparison with measurements is made to demonstrate the validity of the model for both the <b>air</b> <b>case</b> and the dielectric case. Validity of the model is also verified by extending the model to handle the analysis of the skew-plate antenna and comparing the results to those of a skew-segmentation modeling results of the same structure and to available data in the literature.
