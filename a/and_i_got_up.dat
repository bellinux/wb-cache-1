500|$|Johnson {{surprised}} many when {{he weighed}} in at 239pounds at the combine, 12pounds more than expected, although {{he claims that}} this season he played [...] "at about 235 <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> to 238" [...] and that his weight was not a problem. Johnson had told the media {{that he would not}} run the 40-yard dash at the combine but would wait until his March15 workout at Georgia Tech. Johnson ran a 4.35 and wowed scouts with his jump drill results, his receiving skills, and his 11ft 7in (3.53m) broad jump, which is [...] "best broad jump I can ever remember an NFL prospect having," [...] according to Gil Brandt. Johnson is the only player 6-foot-5 or taller, regardless of position, to run a 40-yard dash in under 4.40 seconds at the combine since 2006.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} stand it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> to go away, feeling {{extremely}} particeps criminis. Mrs. Makely {{seemed to have a}} conscience as light as air.|$|E
60|$|But my eyes fell on a {{calabash}} {{that hung}} {{against the wall}} over the table, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> to look at it. I had been hunting for an old one and this was better than any I had seen outside the museum.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a little}} {{interval}} of silence, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> went to the fireplace where the bacon and sausages stood upon a trivet.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{lay still}} afterward, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought he'd gone to sleep. Then the cabin {{seemed to grow}} strangely quiet, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> {{to look at him}} I saw that he was dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it. I {{was carried}} off by some {{students}} who were hazing me. They put a bag {{over my head and}} took me in a boat, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> mixed <b>up.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Mummy, there's a wreck!" [...] {{the former}} cried in excitement. [...] "I heard {{something}} an hour ago, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> and I've been {{sitting by the}} window, watching. I saw the lifeboat go out, and they're signalling now for the other one." ...|$|E
60|$|Then he {{rose from}} his office chair, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> too. My head swam, {{there was no doubt}} about it, and I felt a certain {{heaviness}} of limbs as if they had grown bigger since I had sat down on that chair. I made my bow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said I. [...] "And Miss Estella--that's her niece, I think--handed her in {{cake and}} wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate. And {{we all had}} cake and wine on gold plates. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> behind the coach to eat mine, because she told me to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was like}} this, sir," [...] said Sheen nervously. [...] "At the {{beginning}} of the term {{there was a bit of}} a row down in the town, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> mixed <b>up</b> in it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> didn't--I was afraid to join in. I funked it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The shell {{knocked me}} over, and didn't hurt me a bit. I {{was a little}} stunned, and some dirt was thrown over me, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> on my knees I saw Jewell lying about six yards off--and his legs were all smashed about. Ugh! Pulped! ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have had}} {{experience}} of this [...] "overhauling." [...] There {{was a man}} at Folkestone; I used to meet him on the Lees. He proposed one evening we should go for a long bicycle ride together on the following day, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> agreed. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> early, for me; I made an effort, and was pleased with myself. He came half an hour late: I {{was waiting for him}} in the garden. It was a lovely day. He said:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|So I {{was obliged}} to go off as quickly as might be; {{and the next morning}} Mamma and my sisters made breakfast for me at four, and at five came the [...] "True Blue" [...] light six-inside post-coach to London, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> on the roof without having seen Mary Smith.|$|E
6000|$|Presently she {{was asleep}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> and {{went out of the}} room, but my mind was queerly obsessed by the thought of that little life that had been glad and hopeful only to pass so inexplicably out of hope again into nonentity, this sister of whom I had never heard before. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{none of you}} fellows knew {{anything}} about the business," [...] said Harry. [...] "Kate <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> the company, and we needn't have had a Board of Directors at all, if we hadn't wanted to. If any of you boys had known anything about telegraphs we would have given you an office." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Somebody {{must have}} hauled the old ice factory {{up to where}} <b>I</b> was, <b>and</b> put it around me, for there's where I was when I woke up the next morning. As soon as I could {{recollect}} by name <b>and</b> address <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> held an inquest. My last cent was gone. I was all in.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{exploring}} the cliff above when I happened to slip {{and fall into}} the bushes {{just in front of}} the door. I was shook up but not hurt, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>I</b> saw the door and wondered what it meant. Then <b>I</b> looked inside <b>and</b> after that went back to camp to tell you fellows about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not? I {{thought it}} would be nicer than a public dining-room, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> this morning <b>and</b> saw what the weather was I telephoned." [...] He placed two chairs before the fire, which had begun to blaze. [...] "Isn't it cosy?" [...] he said, taking her hands and pulling her toward him. His own hands trembled, {{the tips of his fingers}} were cold.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do? Why, I jist held {{my breath}} and looked, and in a minute it kind o' faded away, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> {{and went to the}} bed, but the man was gone. He lay there with the pleasantest smile on his face that ever you see; and I woke up Ruey, and told her about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{directly}} {{everybody was}} asleep last night--it wasn't till after one, {{as there was}} a rag on--Moriarty <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> dressed, and climbed up into the gallery. Ye know the gallery windows? They open at the top, an' it's rather hard {{to get out of}} them. But we managed it, and dropped on to the gravel outside." ...|$|E
6000|$|When I woke up an {{hour ago}} and heard the clock strike 4, I said [...] "I {{seem to have been}} asleep an immensely long time; I must have gone to bed mighty early; I wonder what time I did go to bed." [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> and lit a candle and looked at my watch to see.|$|E
50|$|We raced back to {{the hotel}} <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> to the doctor's room it looked like a battle zone - like a scene from a war movie. Players were lying all over the place and the doctor and physio were walking around injecting them. I was a police officer, I worked with facts. What my eyes told me that night was that the team had {{deliberately}} been poisoned.|$|R
5000|$|Снощи до два часа съм гледал телевизия и тази сутрин съм станал в шест, затова съм изключително изтощен. = [...] "Last night, I watched TV until 2 o'clock <b>and</b> this morning, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> at six, so I'm {{extremely}} exhausted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fought like a lion," [...] ses Sam. [...] "Twice they 'ad me down, <b>and</b> twice <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> agin <b>and</b> {{hammered}} 'em. They both of 'em 'ad knives, but {{my blood}} was up, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't {{take no more}} notice of 'em than if they was made of paper. I knocked 'em both out o' their hands, <b>and</b> if <b>I</b> hit 'em in the face once I did a dozen times. I surprised myself." ...|$|R
60|$|However, I {{came into}} {{town on the}} Monday night {{to be ready for}} Joe, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room and breakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance. Unfortunately the morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have {{concealed}} the fact that Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like some weak giant of a Sweep.|$|E
60|$|Well, {{after the}} first agonizing five minutes, my stage-fright left me, never to return. I know if I {{was going to be}} hanged I could get up and make a good showing, and I intend to. But I shall never forget my {{feelings}} before the agony left me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> here to thank you for her for helping my daughter, by your kindness, to live through her first appearance. And I {{want to thank you for}} your appreciation of her singing, which is, by-the-way, hereditary.|$|E
6000|$|... "As yet," [...] she objected, [...] "I {{know nothing}} of misfortune. The impulse which led me to chuck things was just the most {{wonderful}} thing that ever {{came to me in}} life. I awoke this morning feeling like a freed woman. I sang while I got up. It seemed to me that I had never seen anything so beautiful as the view of Paris from my poky window. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> without a maid, too, Julien. I had no perfectly equipped bathroom to wander into. Not much luxury about these rooms of Janette's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It takes a man a {{few minutes}} {{in such a case}} to think where he is and what has happened, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> they were some {{distance}} away. I ran after them for a quarter of a mile, shouting {{at the top of my}} voice, and accompanied by a mob of boys, all yelling like hell on a Bank Holiday. But one might as well have tried to hail the dead, so I took the 'bus back.|$|R
6000|$|... "He did, if I die {{the next}} moment! I wasn't more than half-way through my vanilla <b>and</b> maple, but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> {{without a word}} and left him. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> ain't seen a sight of him since. So there you are, dearie! Was I right or wrong?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{sat down}} <b>and</b> waited. <b>I</b> waited a long, long time, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{walked up and}} down. In about an hour I began to get anxious. It was more than time for Rectus to return. The walk {{to the end of}} the island and back was not much over a mile--at least, I {{supposed}} it was not. Could anything have happened to the boy? It was not yet sunset, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn't imagine what there was to happen.|$|R
60|$|Captain Giles <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> {{from the}} table, and the {{stranger}} next to Hamilton followed our example, manoeuvring {{himself to his}} feet with difficulty. He, poor fellow, not because he was hungry but I verily believe only to recover his self-respect, had tried to put some of that unworthy food into his mouth. But after dropping his fork twice and generally making a failure of it, he had sat still with an air of intense mortification combined with a ghastly glazed stare. Both Giles and I had avoided looking his way at table.|$|E
6000|$|Knowing that English {{people take}} their breakfast late, Jone <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> early, {{so as to}} get through before our lodger came down. But, bless me, {{when we went to}} the front door to see what sort of a day it was we saw him coming in from a walk. [...] "Fine morning," [...] said he, and in fact there was only a little drizzle of rain, which might stop when the sun got higher; and he stood near us and began to talk about the trout in the stream, which, to my utter amazement, he called a river.|$|E
6000|$|The spirits {{went away}} to fetch him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> at once {{in the middle of}} the night and fled away, {{carrying}} nothing but the hand-bag that had my money in it--thirty thousand dollars; two-thirds of it are in the bag there yet. It was forty days before that man caught up on my track. I just escaped. From habit he had written his real name on a tavern register, but had scratched it out and written [...] "Dagget Barclay" [...] in the place of it. But fear gives you a watchful eye and keen, and I read the true name through the scratches, and fled like a deer.|$|E
5000|$|I {{shot down}} my first Japanese Zero at Guadalcanal. But I didn't see one coming <b>up</b> behind me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> shot <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{knocked out of}} the sky. I didn't bail out - they'll shoot {{you out of your}} {{parachute}} and if you go into the water the sharks will eat you. I was full of shrapnel wounds and had a dead stick - I'd lost the engine - but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back to Guadalcanal. I was a lucky boy.|$|R
6000|$|... "He wouldn't go to bed, the {{old lady}} couldn't make him, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> this morning <b>I</b> didn't think nothin' about it. I s'posed, of course, he'd gone to bed all right, but when I was {{going out to the}} barn I {{stumbled}} across something in the snow, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> felt around, <b>and</b> there he was. He got hold of my revolver someway. It was on the shelf by the washstand, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> s'pose he went out there so't we wouldn't hear him." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{lay awake}} {{best part of}} next day {{thinking}} it over, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>I</b> 'ad made up my mind. I put my clothes in a sack, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> put on some others as much like 'em as possible, on'y p'r'aps a bit older, in case the missis should get asking questions; <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> sat wondering 'ow to get out with the sack without 'er noticing it. She's got a very inquiring mind, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wasn't {{going to tell her}} any lies about it. Besides which I couldn't think of one.|$|R
