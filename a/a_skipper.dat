5|$|Agreeing to this proposal, Crisp became first a Seaman and by {{the summer}} of 1916 <b>a</b> <b>Skipper</b> in the Royal Naval Reserve, {{arranging}} for his son to join the crew of his boat, the HM Armed Smack I'll Try, armed with a 3–pounder gun. On 1 February 1917 in the North Sea, I'll Try had its first confrontation with the enemy when two submarines surfaced close to the smack and her companion the larger Boy Alfred. Despite near misses from enemy torpedoes, both smacks scored hits on their larger opponents and reported them as probable sinkings, although post–war German records show that no submarines were lost on that date. Both skippers were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and a present of £200 for this action, and Crisp was offered a promotion and transfer to an ocean–going Q–ship. He was forced to turn down this offer due to his wife's sudden and terminal illness. She died in June 1917.|$|E

25|$|The first steam {{boats were}} made of wood, but steel hulls were soon {{introduced}} and were divided into watertight compartments. They were well designed for the crew with a large building that contained the wheelhouse and the deckhouse. The boats built in the 20th century only had a mizzen sail, which was used to help steady the boat when its nets were out. The main function of the mast was now as a crane for lifting the catch ashore. It also had a steam capstan on the foredeck near the mast for hauling nets. These boats had a crew of twelve made up of <b>a</b> <b>skipper,</b> driver, fireman (to look after the boiler) and nine deck hands.|$|E

25|$|The keels were wooden boats with {{a pointed}} stern, {{so that the}} bow and stern looked almost the same. They were of shallow draught so that when fully loaded they drew only {{four and a half}} feet. The keels were forty feet long and at least 19 feet wide amidships: a very broad configuration. In 1266 the {{standard}} load of a keel was set at 20 chaldrons (wagonloads) or approximately 17 tons. After 1497 the keel load was frequently increased, until in 1635 it was set at 21.1 tons. A chaldron was a horse-drawn wagon containing 17 cwt of coal. Keels were supposed to be measured by the Kings Commissioners and given a load mark to show when they were full. The keels had a single mast with a square sail attached to a yardarm and two large oars. They had no rudder and so a large sweep was used for steering when the keel was under sail. The oars were used to row when the wind was not favourable. There were also two iron-shod poles for polling the keel through any shallows. The floor of the hold was only two feet below the gunwale to allow for easy loading. The coal was piled high above the top of the hold with wooden boards used to prevent the cargo from sliding. Each keel was manned by <b>a</b> <b>skipper,</b> two crewmen and a boy, known as a ‘pee dee’. The meaning of this title is unknown.|$|E
500|$|... "Gallaher played many dashing games," [...] the British {{newspaper}} The Sportsman reported {{after his}} death, [...] "and led his side from one success to another {{until they were}} deemed invincible. He was a veritable artist, who never deserved all the hard things said about him, especially in South Wales. A great player, a great judge of the game". Gallaher's military experience gave him an appreciation for [...] "discipline, cohesion and steadiness under pressure." [...] He was however quiet, even dour, and preferred to lead by example. He insisted players spend an hour [...] "contemplating the game ahead" [...] on match days, and also that they pay attention to detail. Original All Black Ernie Booth wrote of Gallaher: [...] "To us All Blacks his words would often be, 'Give nothing away; take no chance.' As <b>a</b> <b>skipper</b> he was somewhat a disciplinarian, doubtless imbibed from his previous military experience in South Africa. Still, he treated us all like men, not kids, who were out to 'play the game' for good old New Zealand." [...] Another contemporary said he was [...] "perhaps not the greatest of wing-forwards, as such; but he was acutely skilled as a judge of men and moves".|$|E

500|$|Skipper W was a 1945 sorrel {{stallion}} bred by H. J. Wiescamp of Alamosa, Colorado. Sired by Nick Shoemaker, {{whose father}} was Nick sired by Shiek P-11, Skipper W was out of Hired Girl, a daughter of Cowboy P-12. His second dam, or maternal grandmother, was Leche, who was also fathered by Nick by Shiek P-11. The colt was named Skipper W because, as Wiescamp related:I had another good stud colt born {{around the same time}} as Skipper. He was a palomino sired by Gold Mount and out of Slipalong Wiescamp. That was also the year that the good movie, Showboat, came out and I named the little yellow colt after that picture. Anyway, I had Hired Girl up in a corral and, after she foaled, I told a fellow who was working for me to disinfect the naval on the colt [...] After the man did that, the colt got up and turned around and kicked him 'cause it smarted. I said to that fellow, [...] "Look at that, he already knows he's the boss! I've got a showboat, and every boat needs <b>a</b> <b>skipper,</b> so that's what I'm going to name him– Skipper." [...] I added the W for Wiescamp.|$|E
500|$|Following the members' poll, Yorkshire sent a {{telegram}} to Sutcliffe in South Africa, {{asking him to}} withdraw his acceptance of the captaincy. Sutcliffe replied that he had now considered the offer and was appreciative but had to decline it. When news reached the Yorkshire committee on 18 December, they appointed William Worsley, who had refused the leadership in 1924 due to farming commitments. In the words of Wisden, [...] "Happily the trouble was eventually settled {{to the satisfaction of}} all concerned. Sutcliffe declined the honour and, an invitation being extended to Captain Worsley, that gentleman stepped into the breach." [...] Lord Hawke sent a message which thanked Sutcliffe for [...] "your loyalty to the club". The Yorkshire Post also paid tribute to Sutcliffe and the way he handled himself, noting that while a conflict of opinion had been inevitable, it was [...] "carried to unreasonable lengths". Commenting on the affair, The Times expressed regret that Sutcliffe had felt obliged to turn down the leadership; it noted that amateur captains were preferable in reminding people that cricket was only a game, but that there was nothing in principle to prevent a professional from performing the role. Of Sutcliffe, it said, [...] "One would have liked to see him lead the side, and his general popularity, combined with his skill as a batsman, makes it probable that {{he would have been a}} success. However, half the value of a captain is gone if, before he takes up his duties, people begin to question whether he is the right man for the position, and Sutcliffe has been well-advised to recognise this fact." [...] The newspaper also pointed out that it might have been difficult to choose <b>a</b> <b>skipper</b> from a group of professionals who considered themselves eligible for the role; it added that Rhodes might have found it hard to captain the side as bowlers had historically struggled to be good leaders.|$|E

2500|$|John F. Montgomery, {{who served}} in Budapest as U.S. {{ambassador}} from 1933 to 1941, openly admired this side of Horthy's character and reported the following incident in his memoir: in March 1939, Arrow Cross supporters disrupted a performance at the Budapest opera house by chanting [...] "Justice for Szálasi!" [...] loud enough for the regent to hear. A fight broke out, and when Montgomery went {{to take a closer}} look, he discovered that:two or three men were on the floor and he [...] had another by the throat, slapping his face and shouting what I learned afterward was: [...] "So you would betray your country, would you?" [...] The Regent was alone, but he had the situation in hand.... The whole incident was typical not only of the Regent's deep hatred of alien doctrine, but of the kind of man he is.

2500|$|As captain, he {{suffered}} a lack of support from Geoffrey Boycott, who had hoped to be appointed captain instead, and these tensions contributed to the downfall of Denness as <b>a</b> <b>skipper.</b> [...] Boycott played in the first 6 Tests with Denness as captain, including the five matches in the 1–1 drawn series in the West Indies and the first Test of a 3–0 whitewash against India, during which Denness scored his first two Test centuries, but then Boycott then refused to play under Denness and remained out of the Test team until 1977. [...] After a 0–0 drawn three-match series against Pakistan at home in 1974, his boycott left England exposed in several matches against the fast bowling of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson in the Ashes series in Australia in 1974-5. [...] Denness dropped himself from the England team for the 4th Test at Sydney after scoring only 65 runs in 6 innings (6, 26, 2, 20, 8, 2) {{in the first three}} Tests, although he was selected again for the 5th Test in Adelaide after his replacement John Edrich was injured, and achieving his highest Test score of 188 at Melbourne in the 6th Test to win by an innings.
