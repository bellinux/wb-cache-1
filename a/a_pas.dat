5|$|Immediately {{following}} the first répétition générale of Giselle {{on the stage}} of the Paris Opéra, the danseuse Nathalie Fitz-James used her influence as the mistress of an influential patron of the theatre to have <b>a</b> <b>pas</b> inserted for herself into the ballet. Jean Coralli was required to quickly arrange a number for Fitz-James, which was arranged by Coralli as <b>a</b> <b>pas</b> de deux with the danseur Auguste Mabille serving as Fitz-James's partner. Coralli's original intentions were to have the ballet's composer Adolphe Adam supply the music for Fitz-James's pas, but by this time Adam was unavailable. In light of this, Coralli chose a suite by the composer Friedrich Burgmüller's titled Souvenirs de Ratisbonne to fashion music for Fitz-James's required pas. This pas de deux, which was dubbed the Pas des paysans (or Peasant pas de deux), became part of the ballet's performance tradition.|$|E
5|$|For Carlotta Grisi's {{performances}} as Giselle {{with the}} Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg, Perrot commissioned the composer Cesare Pugni {{to score a}} new pas de cinq for the ballerina that {{was added to the}} first tableau. This pas was only retained for Grisi's performances and never performed again after her departure from St. Petersburg. Marius Petipa would also commission an additional piece for the first tableau of the ballet. This was <b>a</b> <b>pas</b> de deux from the composer Ludwig Minkus that was added to the choreographer's 1884 revival for the ballerina Maria Gorshenkova. As with Pugni's 1850 pas de cinq for Grisi, Gorshenkova's 1884 pas de deux by Minkus never became part of the performance tradition of Giselle.|$|E

25|$|L'Oiseau bleu et la Princesse Florine {{appear in}} <b>a</b> <b>Pas</b> de deux, Act III of The Sleeping Beauty, a ballet in three acts first {{performed}} in 1890. The music was by Pyotr Tchaikovsky (his Opus 66). The original scenario was conceived by Ivan Vsevolozhsky, {{and is based}} on Charles Perrault's La Belle au bois dormant. Marius Petipa choreographed the original production. The premiere performance took place at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg in 1890.|$|E
25|$|This act {{begins by}} reestablishing {{the aura of}} romantic mystery which began Act 1. This is evoked {{by the use of}} high violins and wind chords together, similar to that of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring. The first {{movement}} is characterised by the constant change of tempo, while the second picks up influences from other musical styles in particular that of rhythmic impulse and swooning which characterised Ravel's work. The next movement features solid writing for a chorus of brass instruments, after which high violins are heard over a very low accompaniment. This section also features many solos for various instruments, followed by <b>a</b> <b>pas</b> de trois above a gently undulating accompaniment where lyrical melody lines are heard, with the oboe able to penetrate the whole texture in expressive fashion. The following variation is typical of 19th century ballet music and begins with the violins before spreading {{to the rest of the}} orchestra. Brass, prominent timpani and incisive pizzicato chords in the strings culminate in a sense of urgency in the music which prepares for the musical tension in the final act.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{title of this}} pas was Les Aventures Amourouse de Diane or simply the Pas de Diane and was originally <b>a</b> <b>pas</b> de trois danced by Diana the Roman Goddess of the Hunt, Endymion the shepherd and a satyr, reflecting {{the myth of the}} passion between Diana and Endymion. It is believed that Petipa's inspiration for this pas was a painting by the Russian painter, Karl Bryullov. The traditional version that is danced today is not by Petipa, but by Agrippina Vaganova, who staged her own version of the Pas de Diane when she transferred it into a revival of La Esmeralda in 1935. She altered the scheme by removing the role of the satyr and changing the lead male role to the hunter, Actaeon, with whom Diana dances in the company of twelve of her nymphs. This was a very strange change on Vaganova's part since Diana and Actaeon were not lovers, but had one association when he stumbled upon her bathing naked with her nymphs, after which, she transformed him into a stag and he was hunted down and killed by his own hunting dogs.|$|E
50|$|The Turing degree 0‘, {{which is}} the degree of the halting problem, is <b>a</b> <b>PA</b> degree. There are also PA degrees that are not above 0‘. For example, the low basis theorem implies that there is <b>a</b> low <b>PA</b> degree. On the other hand, Antonín Kučera has proved {{that there is a}} degree less than 0‘ that computes a DNR {{function}} but is not <b>a</b> <b>PA</b> degree (Jockusch 1989:197).|$|R
30|$|When anesthesiologists insert <b>a</b> <b>PA</b> {{catheter}} {{with two}} pressure lines (one for arterial pressure, {{the other for}} the distal port of a pulmonary artery catheter), {{they have no idea}} what the waveform at the proximal port shows. It is certainly important to keep close eyes on the depth of <b>a</b> <b>PA</b> catheter during the insertion so that we could consider possible kinking in early stage. However, the depth of <b>a</b> <b>PA</b> catheter is variable depending on where you insert the catheter and patient’s height (Tempe et al. 2006).|$|R

30|$|In summary, {{to avoid}} {{formation}} {{and development of}} <b>a</b> <b>PA</b> catheter kinking, we strongly recommend that both distal and proximal catheter ports need to be monitored simultaneously in addition to close eyes on the depth of <b>a</b> <b>PA</b> catheter during the insertion, especially in a setting neither portable fluoroscopy nor TEE is available.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>PA</b> model aims {{to create}} the {{illusion}} of actually being the object that it depicts. For example, when used for a product design application, it is important that <b>a</b> <b>PA</b> model provides <b>a</b> convincing perceptual impression of actually being the final product (Nam, 2006; Saakes, 2006; Verlinden, Horváth & Edelenbos, 2006; Keller & Stappers, 2001). Similarly, when used for a museum display application to create a replica of <b>an</b> artefact, <b>a</b> <b>PA</b> model aims {{to create the}} illusion of being the real artefact (Hirooka & Satio, 2006; Senckenberg Museum, 2006; Bimber, Gatesy, Witmer, Raskar & Encarnacao, 2002; Museum of London, 1999).|$|R
50|$|A Turing {{degree is}} defined to be <b>a</b> <b>PA</b> degree {{if there is}} a set of natural numbers in the degree that computes a {{completion}} of Peano Arithmetic.

500|$|Perrault's tale {{has been}} adapted to various media over the centuries. Ludwig Tieck {{published}} a dramatic satire {{based on the}} tale, called Der gestiefelte Kater, and, in 1812, the Brothers Grimm inserted {{a version of the}} tale into their Kinder- und Hausmärchen. In ballet, Puss appears in the third act of Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty in <b>a</b> <b>pas</b> de caractère with The White Cat. In film and television, Walt Disney produced an animated black and white silent short based on the tale in 1922. It was also adapted into a manga by the famous Japanese writer and director Hayao Miyazaki in 1969, and in the mid-1980s, Puss in Boots was televised as an episode of Faerie Tale Theatre with Ben Vereen and Gregory Hines in the cast. Another version from the Cannon Movie Tales series features Christopher Walken as Puss, who in this adaptation is a cat who turns into a human when wearing the boots. Another adaptation of the character with little relation to the story was in the Pokémon anime episode [...] "Like a Meowth to a Flame," [...] where a Meowth owned by the character Tyson wore boots, a hat, and a neckerchief. DreamWorks Animation released the animated feature Puss in Boots, with Antonio Banderas reprising his voice-over role from the Shrek films, on November 4, 2011. This new film's story bears no similarities to the book. The cat food named Puss n Boots is owned by Retrobrands USA LLC and is available in the USA and Canada.|$|E

50|$|The {{growth in}} PA model {{technology}} {{has been marked by}} the recent recreation of Naimark’s ‘Displacements’ installation at SIGGRAPH (Displacements, 2005).

Furthermore, powerful projectors (2000-3000 lumens) can be used to allow <b>a</b> <b>PA</b> model to be located in a well-lit room (Nam, 2005; Umemoro, Keller & Stappers, 2003). However, whilst this technology enables <b>a</b> <b>PA</b> model to be a viable and useful type of display, it does not address its main aim.|$|R
