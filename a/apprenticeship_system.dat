A quantitative and qualitative research (using a postal survey, in-depth interviews and focus groups) among employers was carried out to answer this question. All analyses point in the same direction: the investment in training and supervision is large, immediate returns are limited and long-term returns are very uncertain. This paper illustrates that in cases where apprentices come from the lowest vocational track, financial compensations are not the way to stimulate employers to hire apprentices. Policies promoting apprenticeships for vulnerable young people should focus on measures that enhance successful outcomes of the apprenticeship training. status: publishe...|$|R

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1962 Littleton once again {{traveled}} to Europe, this time to research how glass was taught in universities there. He found nothing that he could bring back to the U.S. to help him educate art students at the University of Wisconsin. At that time, European glass programs were geared solely toward industrial production. Students were not taught hands-on techniques with the material; the craft of working with hot glass was still taught at the factories, under the <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>system.</b> What Littleton did find in Europe was a kindred spirit in glass art, the German Erwin Eisch, who is recognized today as a founder of European studio glass. [...] Eisch {{had set up a}} small work area in his family’s glass factory in Frauenau for the production of his own glass art. [...] Trained as a fine artist in the academies of Germany, he was largely self-taught as a glass blower and at the time produced his work {{with the help of the}} factory’s craftsmen. The friendship begun when Littleton visited Eisch in Frauenau in 1962 lasted for the rest of Littleton’s life, and had profound influence on the work of each.

The Education and Skills Act 2008, when it came into force in the 2013 academic year, initially required participation {{in some form of}} education or training until the school year in which the child turned 17, followed by the age being raised to the young person's 18th birthday in 2015. This was referred to as raising the [...] "participation age" [...] to distinguish it from the school leaving age which remains at 16. To qualify as participation the young person must be in education or training for the equivalent of one day a week (at a minimum). The local council is responsible for ensuring that a suitable place is available. The Act makes similar powers available to the National Assembly for Wales. A spokesperson for the Welsh Assembly indicated that it would want to encourage more young people to stay in education, but without compulsion, so school leavers there are not required to continue with any education or training.|$|E

A stylized model with two key features is developed: (1) apprentices are more productive due to industry-specific training, but (2) from the firm׳s perspective, when training apprentices, technological innovation is costly since training becomes obsolete. Thus, apprentices correlate with slower adoption of skill-replacing technologies, but also less employment polarization. We test this hypothesis on German regions given local variation in <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>systems</b> until 1976.

It was on the old embarrassment of slavery. Reports from the colonies showed that in some at least, and more particularly in Jamaica, the <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>system</b> had led to harsher treatment of the negroes than under slavery. As it has been well put, the bad planters regarded their slave-apprentices as a bad farmer regards a farm near the end of an expiring term. In 1836 Buxton moved for a select committee to inquire into the working of the system. Mr. Gladstone defended it, and he warned parliament against 'incautious and precipitate anticipations of entire success' (March 22). Six days later he was appointed a member of the apprenticeship committee which at once began to investigate the complaints from Jamaica. Mr. Gladstone acted as the representative of the planters on the committee, and he paid very close attention to the proceedings during two sessions. In the spring of 1838 a motion was made to accelerate by two years the end of the <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>system</b> on the slave plantations of the West Indies. Brougham had been raising a tempest of humane sentiment by more than one of his most magnificent speeches. The leading men on both sides in parliament were openly and strongly against a disturbance of the settlement, but the feeling in the constituencies was hot, and in liberal and tory camp alike members in fear and trembling tried to make up their minds. Sir George Grey made an effective case for the law as it stood, and Peel spoke on the same side; but it was agreed that Mr. Gladstone, by his union of fervour, elevation, and a complete mastery of the facts of the case, went deeper than either. Even unwilling witnesses 'felt bound to admit the great ability he displayed.' His address was completely that of an advocate, and he did not even affect to look {{on both sides of the}} question, expressing his joy that the day had at length arrived when he could meet the charges against the planters and enter upon their defence.|$|E

30|$|As a {{more general}} challenge, dual <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>systems</b> rely on the broad support of employers, trade unions and the {{government}} for regulation and financing. In particular, their success critically depends on the trade unions’ willingness to accept apprenticeship contracts which are paid {{below the level of}} standard contracts—in exchange for a commitment from employers to offer practical training. The support of the government involves not only developing special vocational schools and training qualified teachers, but also offering preparatory training for young people who are not yet ready to start an apprenticeship after leaving school. This “pre-apprenticeship” training is essential for low-qualified young people—in particular, when access to the dual system is as competitive as it is in Germany (Caliendo et al., 2011). As a consequence of such broad support, vocational training via apprenticeships is widely recognized by young people, their parents and society as a solid pathway to employment in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.|$|R
