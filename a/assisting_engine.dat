5000|$|The U1, {{numbered}} 2395, {{was initially}} allocated to Barnsley shed {{but due to}} the restricted layout there was transferred to Mexborough on 17 October 1925. The locomotive was used to bank heavy trains up the Worsborough Bank, making up to 18 return trips each day; a typical train consisted of an LNER Class O4 locomotive with 60+ loaded coal wagons then an <b>assisting</b> <b>engine</b> at the rear, usually another O4 or an Ex-GCR Class 1B, and finally the U1. The U1 was attached at Wentworth Junction {{at the bottom of}} the bank, and pushed for the 3+1/2 mi to West Silkstone Junction at the top where it would be detached, while the <b>assisting</b> <b>engine</b> would normally continue as far as Dunford Bridge. Prior to the introduction of the U1 a further two O4 locos would have been used for this work although the additional effort required to operate such a large locomotive as the U1 was not appreciated by the crew; [...] "Twice the work but the same sodding pay" [...] summing up their opinion.|$|E
5000|$|This {{class of}} 4-4-0 {{locomotives}} {{was designed by}} Alexander McDonnell, the Locomotive Superintendent of the GS&WR, and built between 1877 and 1880.

Steering controls included variable-ratio recirculating ball steering gear with optional hydraulic power assist.

5000|$|Faced {{with this}} colossal challenge, Suzuki {{returned}} {{to the production of}} motor vehicles. After the war, the Japanese had a great need for affordable, reliable personal transportation. A number of firms began offering [...] "clip-on" [...] gas-powered engines that could be attached to the typical bicycle. Suzuki's first two-wheeled vehicle was a bicycle fitted with a motor called, the [...] "Power Free." [...] Designed to be inexpensive and simple to build and maintain, the 1952 Power Free had a 36 cc, one horsepower, two-stroke engine. The new double-sprocket gear system enabled the rider to either pedal with the <b>engine</b> <b>assisting,</b> pedal without <b>engine</b> <b>assist,</b> or simply disconnect the pedals and run on engine power alone. The patent office of the new democratic government granted Suzuki a financial subsidy to continue research in motorcycle engineering.|$|R

40|$|Finding {{relevant}} {{information in a}} hyperspace has been a much studied problem for many years. With the emergence of so called Web 2. 0 technologies {{we have seen the}} use of social systems for retrieval tasks increasing dramatically. Each system collects and exploits its own pool of community wisdom for the benefit of its users. In this paper we suggest a form of retrieval which exploits the pools of wisdom of multiple social technologies, specifically social search and social navigation. The paper details the added user benefits of merging several sources of social wisdom. We present details of the <b>ASSIST</b> <b>engine</b> developed to integrate social support mechanisms for the users of information repositories. The goal {{of this paper is to}} present the main features of the integrated community-based personalization engine that we have developed in order to improve retrieval in the hyperspace of information resources. It also reports the results of an empirical study of this technology...|$|R
5000|$|Back in {{the days}} of steam, when <b>assisting</b> <b>engines</b> pushed long goods trains up steep {{gradients}} (or [...] "banks"), the train would come to a halt {{at the bottom of the}} bank. The assisting engine—or [...] "banker"—would either be attached to the rear of the train, or just come up against the guard's brake van's buffers. Then the banker's driver would whistle—using a series of long blasts and shorts. This told both the signalman and the driver of the train engine that he was ready. The train engine's driver would reply in similar fashion and, with signals at clear, they would set off in unison. If the banker was coupled to the train, when it reached the top of the bank, the train would stop or come to a crawl for the banker to be uncoupled; if not, the banker's driver would just ease off the regulator, allowing the train to continue on its way, with, of course, a whistled [...] "goodbye".|$|R

5000|$|It was {{recognised}} {{that the}} Hispano-Suiza engine was not competitive with the [...] Rolls-Royce R, so French designs with more powerful but untested engines were planned. These included the Nieuport-Delage NiD 651 and NiD 652, so Nieuport continued {{to develop the}} second NiD 450 as the NiD 650. Modifications to it {{were based on the}} lessons of the earlier tests; externally, the principal alteration was a much larger aperture in the nose to <b>assist</b> <b>engine</b> cooling. A three-bladed Levasseur propeller was probably used for the first flight on 12 March. Only four more flights had been made by the end of April, with the NiD 650 reluctant to take-off, so new floats of greater area and with two steps were tried. Strong propeller torque made it hard to keep on line at take-off so the fin was modified and the floats fuelled asymmetrically. More unsuccessful take-off tests followed; on 22 July the NiD 650, just leaving the water, crashed at high speed. Pilot and engineer survived and the airframe was recovered, but with its wings and floats badly damaged.|$|R

50|$|Mild hybrids are {{essentially}} conventional vehicles with some hybrid hardware, but with limited hybrid features.

50|$|In the single-piston designs, {{the engine}} captures the heat lost from the {{four-stroke}} Otto cycle or Diesel cycle and {{uses it to}} drive an additional power and exhaust stroke of the piston in the same cylinder {{in an attempt to}} improve fuel-efficiency and/or <b>assist</b> with <b>engine</b> cooling.
