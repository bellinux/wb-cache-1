An ardent socialist, Boyce famously declared:There can be no harmony between organized capitalists and organized labor. Our present wage system is slavery in its worst form. … Advise strikes as the weapon {{to be used by}} labor to obtain its rights, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> be branded as criminals who aim to ruin the business interests of the country. Change from the policy of simple trades unionism that is fast waning, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> be told that your action is premature, as this is not the time. Pursue the methods adopted by capitalists <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> be sent to prison for robbery or executed for murder. Demand, and your demands will be construed into threats of violence against the rights of private property calculated to scare capital. Avail yourself of your constitutional rights and propose to take political action, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> be charged with selling out the organization to some political party. Counsel arbitration, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> be told that there is nothing to arbitrate.

Take what action you will in the interests of labor, the trained beagles in the employ of capital from behind their loathsome fortress of disguised patriotism will howl their tirade of condemnation.|$|E

25|$|Bart D. Ehrman {{argues that}} {{different}} parts of the Bible give different answers. One example is evil as punishment for sin or as a consequence of sin. Ehrman writes that this seems to be based on some notion of free will although this argument is never explicitly mentioned in the Bible. Another argument is that suffering ultimately achieves a greater good, possibly for persons other than the sufferer, {{that would not have been}} possible otherwise. The Book of Job offers two different answers: suffering is a test, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> be rewarded later for passing it; another that God in his might chooses not to reveal his reasons. Ecclesiastes sees suffering as beyond human abilities to comprehend. Apocalyptic parts, including the New Testament, see suffering as due to cosmic evil forces, that God for mysterious reasons has given power over the world, but which will soon be defeated and things will be set right.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, {{and that}} is all to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's boss and the one who does the heavy thinking, Archie is, unless our guess is wide of the mark, the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero wants something done, he does not need to tell Archie how to do it. Archie will figure that out for himself, and the thing is as good as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and wait for him to come through with the solution. The book is full of surprises for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> need no urging to go on with it.|$|E

25|$|To {{commemorate the}} Master's forty-fifth anniversary, Big Finish did a trilogy of audios {{featuring}} the Master in 2016; <b>And</b> <b>You</b> <b>Will</b> Obey Me pits the Fifth Doctor against the Beevers {{incarnation of the}} Master, seeking to regain his body after an unspecified attack left him seriously injured and hunted, and Vampire of the Mind pits the Sixth Doctor against the MacQueen incarnation of the Master, who is seeking to drain the neural energy of the Doctor and various Earth scientists to restore his own mind after some terrible accident. These two storylines come together in The Two Masters, in which the Seventh Doctor faces both of these incarnations of the Master at once and realizes {{that they have been}} transferred into each other's bodies as part of a complex plan by the Cult of the Heretic, a cult dedicated to a Time Lord who sought to unmake the universe. The resulting paradox of the two Masters in each other's bodies, coupled {{with the fact that the}} Cult manipulated the MacQueen Master into attacking the Beevers incarnation, resulting in the crippled form witnessed in The Deadly Assassin, is revealed to be causing the universe to collapse. The Masters are able to restore themselves to their own bodies, steal the Doctor's TARDIS to trap him on a battlecruiser about to crash, and finish unmaking the universe before destroying the Cult, but the Doctor manages to track them using the Master's own TARDIS. With the Cult destroyed, the Doctor uses the Masters' discarded weapons to immobilize the two Masters before using the Cult's equipment to rebuild the universe as it was, with his only changes being to send both Masters back to their original locations in time and space and save the life of a temporary companion whom the Master had killed.|$|E

500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov felt talented {{students}} needed little formal dictated instruction. His teaching method included distinct steps: show the students everything needed in harmony and counterpoint; direct them {{in understanding the}} forms of composition; give them {{a year or two}} of systematic study in the development of technique, exercises in free composition and orchestration; instill a good knowledge of the piano. Once these were properly completed, studies would be over. He carried this attitude into his conservatory classes. Conductor Nikolai Malko remembered that Rimsky-Korsakov began the first class of the term by saying, [...] "I will speak, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> listen. Then I will speak less, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> start to work. And finally I will not speak at all, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> work." [...] Malko added that his class followed exactly this pattern. [...] "Rimsky-Korsakov explained everything so clearly and simply that all we had to do was to do our work well." ...|$|E
