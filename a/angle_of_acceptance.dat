Therefore the effect of accumulated dust on the specular reflectance of solar mirrors should be understood well in order to improve the site-dependent performance prediction. Furthermore, an optimization of the CSP System maintenance, in particular the cleaning cycles, can be achieved. Our measurements show a noticeable decrease of specular reflectance when the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> incidence is increased.

MaReCo has been evaluated in earlier reports, so {{the main purpose of}} the measurements in this project has been to get a reference to the results on Solar 8, using both established and new measurement devices and techniques. The study is conducted at Lund Institute of Technology (LTH). The simulated annual electrical output for a Solar 8 system located in Lund, Sweden, based on the conducted measurements, is 42 kWh. m- 2. yr- 1 glazed area. For an ideal model using a PV module with 18 % COP, the output would increase to 59 kWh. m- 2. yr- 1 glazed area and 813 kWh. m- 2. yr- 1 PV cell area. The simulated thermal output from the system is 330 kWh. m- 2. yr- 1 at 25 °C working temperature. If the trough is instead operated at a working temperature of 50 °C, the electric output would decrease with approximately 11 % and the thermal output with 10 %. For Madrid, the simulated thermal output is 681 kWh. m- 2. yr- 1 glazed area and the electrical output would be 118 kWh. m- 2. yr- 1 glazed area and 1607 kWh. m- 2. yr- 1 cell area respectively, to compare with 257 kWh. m- 2. yr- 1 for a fixed flat module. This means that the PV cells deliver 6. 3 Evaluation of the concentrating PVT systems MaReCo and Solar 8 4 times as much electric energy per area unit. For Lund, the equivalent value would be 5. 4 times, which is due to the lower ratio of direct radiation in Northern Europe.
