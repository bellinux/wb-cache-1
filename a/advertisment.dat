50|$|In 1641 Briget and Robert Paget {{brought out}} A defence of church-government, {{exercised}} in presbyteriall, classical, & synodall assemblies. Once again {{there was a}} preface by Robert, explaining {{the context of the}} work, which lay in John Paget's controversies with the English separatists in Amsterdam. However, publication came just as the conflict between Charles I, Elizabeth's brother, and Parliament reached a critical stage. Thomas Paget therefore contributed by way of dedication an Humble <b>Advertisment</b> to the high Court of Parliament, presenting the book to the House of Commons. This rehearsed the history of nonconformity in the Diocese of Chester, especially those aspects in which Thomas had personal involvement. It also sought to distinguish the Presbyterian cause from that of more radical Calvinists, with which the royalist agitator Sir Thomas Aston, 1st Baronet had sought to conflate it.|$|E
30|$|Using {{the address}} information, {{geographic}} features from OSM were calculated using the offered Application Programming Interface (API) following the methodology described in Geographic features from OpenStreetMap data section. Features from real estate <b>advertisments</b> were computed {{as described in}} Feature extraction from real estate portals section. For the analysis in this paper, 34 features from the real estate portal data were present in more than 1000 <b>advertisments</b> and therefore used (the features include for example: category and type of the dwelling, rent per month, net rent per square meter, number of rooms, living area, year of construction, distances to next bus station / highway / kindergarden / school / shopping, existence of balcony, cable TV). Missing values have been encoded with −[*] 1 being {{able to use the}} data in the further analysis.|$|R
30|$|The {{major issue}} {{regarding}} the use of real estate portal data is the sparsity of data (i.e., high number of missing values). There are two reasons for missing values in features from that data source. First, the number of real estate advertisements in the surrounding of a target address is strongly dependent on the location (there might be, for example, more <b>advertisments</b> in city centers than in suburbs) and on the point in time when the data is retrieved (e.g., more offers at the end of school years and less offers at the start of courses in university cities). Second, the amount of information provided in <b>advertisments</b> varies to a large extent, because users only insert information on household properties that exist (e.g., elevator in the house, pool in the garden) or do not want to provide some information.|$|R
