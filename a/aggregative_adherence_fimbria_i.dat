40|$|Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC) are {{emerging}} enteropathogens associated with human diarrhea diseases and food poisoning cases. They show distinctive aggregative pattern of adherence to cultured human epithelial cells. However, EAggEC strains are diverse {{and not all}} of them have the <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbria</b> <b>I</b> (AAF/ 1), AAF/II and heat-stable enterotoxin 1 (EAST 1) genes. We attemptd to determine the incidence of EAggEC in E. coli isolates from diarrhea patients in Taiwan and to characterize these EAggEC strains. We used three activity assays including HeLa, cell adhesion, human blood hemagglutination and bacterial clumping tests and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers designed from an aggregative adherence pattern associated plasmid (pCVD 432) to screen the EAggEC strains in 403 E. coli isolates including 63 laboratory isolates and 340 clinical isolates obtained from diarrheal disease cases. All these 403 E. coli strains were also assayed with novel PCR primers designed from AAF/I (aggA), AAF/II (aafA) and EAST I (astA) genes. Results showed that except for the three EAggEC reference strains, only three clinical isolates were identified as EAggEC strains. Including the reference strains, all the E. coli strains with EAggEC activity generated positive PCR results to the aggA gene based primers, but not to the aafA and astA gene targeted primers.

40|$|The aggregative {{pattern of}} {{adherence}} (AA) exhibited by enteroaggregative Escherichia coli upon HEp- 2 cells is a plasmid-associated property which correlates with <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbria</b> <b>I</b> (AAF/I) expression and human erythrocyte hemagglutination. By using cloning and mutagenesis strategies, two noncontiguous plasmid segments (designated regions 1 and 2) required for AA expression have previously {{been identified in}} enteroaggregative E. coli 17 - 2. TnphoA mutagenesis was performed on clones containing region 1, and 16 TnphoA mutants which were negative for the AA phenotype were analyzed. The TnphoA insertion site for each mutant was determined by junctional DNA sequencing. All 16 mutations occurred within a 4. 6 -kb span in region 1. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the region revealed four contiguous open reading frames, designated aggDCBA, in the same span. AA-negative TnphoA insertions into all open reading frames except aggB were obtained. On the basis of mutational analysis and protein homology data, it is inferred that aggA, aggC, and aggD are involved in biogenesis of AAF/I, encoding a major fimbrial subunit, outer membrane usher, and periplasmic fimbrial chaperone, respectively. By immunogold electron microscopy, polyclonal antiserum raised against the aggA gene product decorated AAF/I fimbriae, affirming that AggA encodes an AAF/I subunit.

40|$|Seventeen Escherichia coli O 111 :H 12 strains {{isolated}} from the feces of children with acute diarrhea were studied {{with regard to their}} adherence properties and other virulence characteristics. All strains showed an aggregative adherence pattern to HEp- 2 cells and agglutinated bovine and sheep red cells in the presence of mannose. These strains did not have gene sequences homologous to the <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbria</b> <b>I</b> gene and did not react with any of the DNA probes used to detect other virulence genes in enteropathogens. With one exception, the O 111 :H 12 strains did not induce fluid accumulation in the rabbit ileal loop assay, although 16 of the strains had the enteroaggregative E. coli heat-stable enterotoxin 1 (EAST 1) gene sequences. A 60 - 70 MDa plasmid was present in 16 of the strains studied. We conclude that the O 111 :H 12 serotype, one of the first E. coli identified in infantile diarrhea, belongs to the enteroaggregative E. coli category but the genes encoding its adherence phenotype are distinct from those previously described.

40|$|The rapid {{emergence}} of treatment-resistant bacterial pathogens {{has become a}} major threat to public health. The outbreak of new Shiga-toxin–producing Escherichia coli O 104 H 4 infection occured in Germany in 2011 illustrates this problem. To colonize host tissues, pathogenic bacteria express surface adhesive organelles. The German strain uses <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbriae</b> <b>I</b> (AAF/I) to anchor to the intestinal mucosa and induce inflammation. AAF/I belong to the family of chaperone/usher assembled fimbrial polyadhesins. Polyadhesins are functioning as an armory for penetration through the host immune shield. The polyadhesin-binding to the target cells triggers subversive signal by aggregation of host cell receptors that allow pathogens to mislead and evade immune defense. Their binding is orchestrated with the type III secretion system, which is extremally important for bacterial virulency. Polyadhesins also are involved in biofilm formation making bacteria more resistant to immune response. Because of this, the polyadhesins are potential targets for immune countermeasures against bacterial infections, in particular for anti-adhesion therapy with antibodies to polyadhesins as one of alternatives to antibiotic therapy...|$|R

We have previously shown that the <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> (AA) property of EAggEC {{is associated with the}} presence of a 60 -MDa plasmid which confers AA when introduced into E. coli HB 101. Here, we report the cloning of the AA determinant from EAggEC strain 17 - 2 into the 21. 5 -kb cosmid vector pCVD 301. TnphoA mutagenesis of the AA cosmid clone pJPN 31 implicated an AA region of approximately 12 kb. Transmission electron microscopy of HB 101 (pJPN 31) revealed the presence of bundle-forming fimbriae, which were absent in AA- TnphoA insertion mutants. The presence of these fimbriae, AA, and hemagglutination (HA) of human erythrocytes were all concurrently lost by single-insertion mutations. A 14 -kDa protein was seen on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting (immunoblotting) of surface shear preparations from fimbriated clones. Twelve of nineteen volunteers fed EAggEC 17 - 2 developed rises in antibodies to the 14 -kDa protein as determined by Western blot.

40|$|Adherence to HEp- 2 cells by many enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC) strains is {{associated}} with the expression of flexible, bundle-forming fimbriae 2 to 3 nm in diameter, designated <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbriae</b> <b>I</b> (AAF/I). We have previously reported the molecular cloning and TnphoA mutagenesis of AAF/I genes from the large plasmid of prototype EAggEC strain 17 - 2 (J. P. Nataro, Y. Deng, D. R. Maneval, A. L. German, W. C. Martin, and M. M. Levine, Infect. Immun. 60 : 2297 - 2304, 1992). Here, we report that further mapping and subcloning of AAF/I regions suggest that expression of the fimbriae requires two separate plasmid regions (designated regions 1 and 2). Approximately 9 kb of DNA unnecessary for fimbrial expression separates the two regions; this intervening segment encodes the EAggEC heat-stable enterotoxin (EAST 1). Neither region was capable of conferring <b>aggregative</b> HEp- 2 <b>adherence</b> (AA) when cloned individually; when the two regions were cloned as a single fragment or when each was cloned into a different vector and introduced into the same E. coli HB 101 cell, AA was restored.

40|$|Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) {{has been}} implicated {{as an agent}} of {{pediatric}} diarrhea in the developing world. We have shown previously that EAEC adheres to HEp- 2 cells by virtue of a plasmid-encoded fimbrial adhesin designated <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbria</b> <b>I</b> (AAF/I), the genes for which have been cloned and sequenced. However, not all EAEC strains express AAF/I. Using TnphoA mutagenesis, we have characterized a novel fimbria (designated AAF/II) which mediates HEp- 2 adherence of the human-pathogenic strain 042. AAF/II is 5 nm in diameter and does not bind AAF/I antiserum, as determined by immunogold transmission electron microscopy. TnphoA identified a gene (designated aafA) which bears significant homology to aggA, the fimbrial subunit of AAF/I (25 % identity and 47 % similarity at the amino acid level). When hyperexpressed and purified by polyhistidine tagging, the AafA protein assembled into 5 -nm-diameter filaments which bound anti-AAF/II antiserum. The cloned aafA gene complemented a mutation in the aggA gene to confer fimbrial expression from the AAF/I gene cluster, manifesting phenotypes characteristic of AAF/II but not AAF/I. The aafA mutant did not adhere to human intestinal tissue in culture, suggesting a role for AAF/II in intestinal colonization. By using DNA probes for AAF/I and AAF/II derived from fimbrial biosynthesis genes, we show that AAF/I and AAF/II are each found in only a minority of EAEC strains, suggesting that still more EAEC adhesins exist. Our data suggest that AAF adhesins represent a new family of fimbrial adhesins which mediate aggregative adherence in EAEC...|$|E

It is a rapid, sensitive, and specific tool for detecting EHECO 104 :H 4 in human stools. A large outbreak caused by Shiga toxin 2 (Stx 2) -producing en-terohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O 104 :H 4 that in-volved 4, 000 cases, including 855 patients with hemolytic-ure-mic syndrome (HUS) and 53 fatalities, occurred in Germany in May to July 2011 (6, 14). Early in the outbreak, we and others developed PCRs targeting typical molecular features of the out-break strain, including the stx 2 gene and the wzyO 104 and fliCH 4 genes, components of the O 104 and H 4 antigen synthetic gene clusters, respectively (3), or stx 2 plus aggC and aggD, components of the gene cluster encoding <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbria</b> <b>I</b> (13). Here, we extended this approach by developing a real-time mul-tiplex PCR (rtMPCR) and evaluating its utility for the detection of EHEC O 104 :H 4 in human stools.

The EAEC category is heterogeneous, but most in-depth experimentation {{has focused on}} prototypical strain, 042. We hypothesized that 60 A, another EAEC strain, might posses virulence or fitness genes that 042 does not have. Through subtractive hybridization we identified 60 A-specific sequences, including loci present in other E. coli and phage DNA. One locus thus identified was impB, a LexA repressed error-prone DNA repair gene that has been identified in plasmids from other enteric organisms and which we detected in 21 of 34 EAEC strains. An isogenic 60 A impB mutant showed decreased survival and mutagenesis after exposure to UV, as well as bile salt exposure, compared to the wild-type strain, and these phenotypes could be complemented in trans. The EAEC strain 60 A imp operon differs structurally from previously described homologs. A cryptic gene, impC, present in other imp operons, is absent from 60 A. In addition, transcription of impAB in strain 60 A occurs from a promoter that is dissimilar to the previously described impC promoter but is still triggered by UV-mediated damage. In strain 60 A the impAB and the <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbriae</b> <b>I</b> (AAF/I) -encoding genes {{are on the same}} large plasmid, and the 60 A version of the operon is predominantly seen in AAF/I-positive EAEC.

The AAF/I-mediated augmented intestinal adherence might facilitate systemic absorption of Shiga toxin, the major virulence factor of EHEC, presumably enhancing virulence of the outbreak strain. However, the stability of pAA in the outbreak strain is unknown. We therefore tested outbreak isolates for pAA, monitored pAA loss during infection, and determined the impact of pAA loss on adherence and clinical outcome of infection. E. coli O 104 :H 4 outbreak isolates from 170 patients (128 with hemolytic uremic syndrome [HUS] and 42 with diarrhea without HUS) were tested for pAA using polymerase chain reaction and plasmid profiling. pAA-harboring bacteria in stool samples were quantified using colony blot hybridization, and adherence to HCT- 8 cells was determined. Isolates from 12 (7. 1 %) patients lacked pAA. Analyses of sequential stool samples demonstrated that the percentages of pAA-positive populations in the initial stools {{were significantly higher than}} those in the follow-up stools collected two to eight days later in disease (P≤ 0. 01). This indicates a rapid loss of pAA during infections of humans. The pAA loss was associated with loss of the <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> phenotype and significantly reduced correlation with HUS (P  =  0. 001). The pAA plasmid can be lost by E. coli O 104 :H 4 outbreak strain in the human gut in the course of disease. pAA loss might attenuate virulence and diminish the ability to cause HUS.

40|$|Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC) {{has been}} {{associated}} with persistent pediatric diarrhea in the developing world, yet the pathogenetic mechanisms of EAggEC infection are unknown. Our previous data have suggested that <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> of some EAggEC strains to HEp- 2 cells is mediated by flexible, bundle-forming fimbriae, which we have termed <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbriae</b> <b>I</b> (AAF/I). Genes sufficient to confer expression of AAF/I are located on the 60 -MDa plasmid of EAggEC 17 - 2; AAF/I genes are present as two unlinked plasmid regions (regions 1 and 2), separated by 9 kb of DNA. Here we report the complete DNA sequencing of region 2 and the identification of an open reading frame which is involved in the expression of AAF/I. One open reading frame of 794 bp encodes a protein (designated AggR) with a predicted molecular size of 29. 4 kDa, which shows a high degree of amino acid sequence identity to CfaR {{and other members of the}} AraC class of gene regulators. The cloned aggR gene (or, alternatively, a cloned cfaR gene) was sufficient to complement a region 1 clone to confer AAF/I expression. To further substantiate the role of aggR in the regulation of AAF/I, we constructed a 289 -bp in-frame aggR deletion and replaced the native gene in 17 - 2 by allelic exchange, using the temperature-sensitive vector pIB 307. The resulting aggR deletions were negative for AAF/I expression, but expression was restored when the aggR gene (cloned into pBluescript II SK) was reintroduced into the aggR mutant. RNA slot blot experiments using a probe for the putative AAF/I pilin subunit (aggA) revealed that aggR operates as a transcriptional activator of aggA expression. aggA::phoA fusions were constructed in 17 - 2 and in 17 - 2 delta aggR. AggR was found to promote expression of the aggA gene under a variety of conditions of temperature, osmolarity, oxygen tension, and medium.

EAEC strains harboring mutations in known EAEC virulence determinants were tested in an in vitro model of transepithelial migration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and in human intestinal xenografts in severe-combined immunodeficient (SCID-HU-INT) mice, a novel model for studying EAEC disease in vivo. Results. Expression of <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbriae</b> (AAFs), the principal adhesins of EAEC, was required for EAEC-induced PMN transepithelial migration in vitro. Moreover, constructed plasmids encoding AAF gene clusters demonstrated that the AAF adhesins are sufficient for triggering this event in a nonpathogenic E. coli background. Furthermore, with use of the SCID-HU-INT mouse model, severe tissue damage and infiltration of inflammatory cells was observed in the human tissue after EAEC infection. These pathological marks were strongly related to AAF expression, thus clearly confirming our in vitro findings. Conclusions. The present work establishes EAEC as an important inflammatory pathogen and the AAF adhe-sins as inducers of potentially detrimental immune responses.

40|$|A {{strain of}} Escherichia coliO 111 :H 21 {{recently}} {{isolated in the}} United Kingdom harbored the phage-encoded vtx 2 c gene and the <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> plasmid. Although exhibiting the same pathogenic profile as the E. coliO 104 :H 4 strain linked to the out-break in Germany, there were important differences in strain characteristics and in the epidemiological setting. Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) strains, awell-known cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and bloody diarrhea, are defined {{by the presence of}} one or both phage-encoded verocytotoxin genes, vtx 1 and vtx 2 (10). Enteroaggrega-tive E. coli (EAggEC) strains are a heterogeneous group defined by their stacked-brick aggregating adherence to HEp- 2 cells (16). Those with proven pathogenicity typically harbor a set of plasmid genes encoding <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbriae</b> (AAF), a dispersin protein (Aap), and an <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> transport (Aat) pro-tein, all regulated by a transcription factor encoded by the aggR gene (17). In May 2011, a large food-borne outbreak in Germany, where the source was identified as fenugreek seeds, was associated with a strain of E. coli O 104 :H 4 (3, 5). Molecular analysis of this isolate with PCR detected a vtx 2 -positive, eae-negative VTEC strain which was subsequently found to possess typical molecular char-acteristics of EAggEC (1). Due in part {{to the size of the}} outbreak but also to the rapid availability of the genome sequence, this isolate has been described in detail in the literature (14, 18). Prior to this outbreak, two strains with the same pathogenic profile had been described:E. coliO 111 :H 2 that caused an outbreak ofHUS in France in 1996 (15) and E. coliO 86 :NM, associated with a case o...|$|R
40|$|Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) {{has been}} implicated in {{sporadic}} diarrhea in children and adults and {{has been identified as}} the cause of several outbreaks worldwide. The HEp- 2 test remains the gold standard for identification of this pathotype. A 60 - 65 MDa plasmid encodes the <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbriae</b> (AAF/I and AAF/II), a transcriptional activator (aggR gene), the enteroaggregative heat-stable enterotoxin EAST 1 (astA gene) and a cytotoxin (Pet). The standard assay for EAEC is performed only in research laboratories, because it is expensive, labor intensive and time-consuming. The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) offers the possibility of rapid diagnosis. In the current study, a multiplex PCR assay which checks aggR and astA genes was designed. Eigthy- eight E. coli strains, isolated from children with acute diarrhea in Mendoza, Argentina, were characterized by the reference method (HEp- 2 assay), and by aggRastA PCR. A strong correlation between the presence of the specific marker aggR and the reference test was found. The astA gene had a similar distribution between aggregative and localized strains, indicating that this gene could not be considered as a marker of EAEC. We conclude that aggR may be used to identify EAEC, using the PCR method as a screening test...|$|R
40|$|Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is an {{important}} cause of diarrhea worldwide. We analyzed 17 Danish EAEC strains, isolated {{in the course of}} a case control study, for phenotypic and genotypic properties. The strains belonged to at least 14 different serotypes. Using PCR to investigate the prevalence of various putative virulence genes, we found that all but two strains were typical EAEC, as they harbored all or part of the previously described AggR regulon. The majority of the strains harbored genes encoding <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbriae</b> (AAF). The most common was AAF/I, found in nine strains; eight strains carried no known AAF-related genes. We utilized TnphoA mutagenesis to localize the <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> (AA) adhesin from one typical EAEC strain, C 1010 - 00, which lacked a known AAF. We identified a TnphoA insertion in a hypothetical Dr-related pilin deposited in GenBank as HdaA. Four additional Danish strains harbored HdaA, and all but one displayed AA to HEp- 2 cells. By using PCR primers derived from the pilins and ushers from the three AAF and Hda, we found that 16 of 17 strains exhibited evidence of one of these factors; importantly, the one negative strain also lacked the aggR gene. Cloning of the complete Hda gene cluster and expression in E. coli DH 5 α resulted in AA and complementation of the C 1010 - 00 nonadherent mutant. Four related adhesins have now been found to confer AA in typical EAEC strains; our data suggest that, together, these variants may account for AA in the large majority of strains...|$|R
40|$|Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) {{is defined}} by a {{characteristic}} “stacked-brick” <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> (AA) pattern to cultured cells. In well-studied EAEC prototype strains (called typical EAEC strains), the AA phenotype requires <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbriae</b> (AAFs). However, previous studies suggest that known AAF alleles are not found in all EAEC strains. To define mechanisms contributing to adherence in an atypical strain, we studied EAEC strain C 1096. An E. coli K 12 derivative carrying two plasmids, designated pSERB 1 and pSERB 2, from C 1096 adhered to cell lines and exhibited an AA pattern. Nucleotide sequence analysis of pSERB 1 indicated that it is related to plasmids of the IncI 1 incompatibility group. These plasmids encode genes involved in pilus-mediated conjugal transfer, as well as pilL-V, which encodes a second pilus of the type IV family. Insertional inactivation of the gene predicted to encode the major type IV pilin subunit (pilS) reduced conjugal transfer of the plasmid by 4 orders of magnitude. Adherence of the mutant strain to polystyrene and to HT 29 cells was reduced by approximately 21 % and 75 %, respectively. In a continuous-flow microfermentor, the pilS inactivation reduced mature biofilm formation on a glass slide by approximately 50 %. In addition, the simultaneous presence of both pSERB 1 and pSERB 2 plasmids promoted pilS-independent biofilm formation. We conclude that the IncI 1 plasmid of EAEC C 1096 encodes a type IV pilus that contributes to plasmid conjugation, epithelial cell adherence, and adherence to abiotic surfaces. We also observe that AA can be mediated by factors distinct from AAF adhesins...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{roles of}} diffusely-adherent Escherichia coli (DAEC) and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) in disease {{are not well}} understood, {{in part because of}} the {{limitations}} of diagnostic tests for each of these categories of diarrhoea-causing E. coli. A HEp- 2 adherence assay is the Gold Standard for detecting both EAEC and DAEC but DNA probes with limited sensitivity are also employed. Results We demonstrate that the daaC probe, conventionally used to detect DAEC, cross-reacts with a subset of strains belonging to the EAEC category. The cross hybridization is due to 84 % identity, at the nucleotide level, between the daaC locus and the <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbriae</b> II cluster gene, aafC, present in some EAEC strains. Because aaf -positive EAEC show a better association with diarrhoea than other EAEC, this specific cross-hybridization may have contributed to an over-estimation of the association of daaC with disease in some studies. We have developed a discriminatory PCR-RFLP protocol to delineate EAEC strains detected by the daaC probe in molecular epidemiological studies. Conclusions A PCR-RFLP protocol described herein can be used to identify aaf -positive EAEC and daaC -positive DAEC and to delineate these two types of diarrhoeagenic E. coli, which both react with the daaC probe. This should help to improve current understanding and future investigations of DAEC and EAEC epidemiology. </p...|$|R
40|$|Adherence to the {{intestinal}} epithelia {{is a key}} feature in enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) infection. The <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbriae</b> (AAFs) are involved in EAEC interaction with receptors at the surface of intestinal cells. We and others have demonstrated that fibronectin is a receptor for AAF/II fimbriae. Considering that the major cellular receptor of fibronectin is integrin α 5 β 1, {{in this study we}} evaluated the participation of this receptor in the fibronectin-mediated adherence of EAEC strain 042 to intestinal cells. We found that EAEC strain 042 has the ability to bind directly and indirectly to integrin α 5 β 1; direct binding was not mediated by AAF/II fimbriae and indirect binding was mediated by AAF/II and fibronectin. Coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed the formation of the complex AafA/fibronectin/integrin α 5 β 1. To evaluate EAEC adherence to intestinal cells, T 84 cells were incubated with fibronectin and an antibody that blocks the interaction region of integrin α 5 β 1 to fibronectin, the RGD site. Under these conditions, we found the number of adherent bacteria to epithelial cells significantly reduced. Additionally, fibronectin-mediated adherence of EAEC strain 042 was abolished in HEp- 2 cells transfected with integrin α 5 shRNA. Altogether, our data support the involvement of integrin α 5 β 1 in the fibronectin-mediated EAEC binding to intestinal cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{outbreak}} {{strain of}} _E. coli_ O 104 :H 4 has been sequenced by several groups and made available publicly for CrowdSourcing purposes. Genome {{comparisons of the}} complete finished sequence of TY 2482 (BGI), have been made with the draft assemblies of c 22711 (PacBio) and an historical outbreak strain from 2001 (U. Münster &#x 26; Life Technologies). A plasmid, pTY 2, carrying the _agg_ operon specifying the genes for <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbriae</b> reveals a frameshift in a gene, _aggB_, that may result in altered binding _in vivo_ compared to the unframeshifted state. Comparisons additionally reveal the presence of genomic islands specific to the outbreak strain relative to other sequenced _E. coli_ strains. These regions, and islands shared with the closest previously sequenced relative _E. coli_ 55989 have been analyzed for insertion sequences and transposable elements. Several islands found in the above strains that are not present in other sequenced _E. coli_ are found to harbor a large-scale expansion of mobile elements that are by and large confined to these hotspot or permissive areas of the chromosome. The implication is that these regions are in genomic flux and may represent specific areas of future concern due {{to the possibility of}} mobilisation of the associated genomic features likely responsible for the pathogenic features and antibiotic resistance seen in these strains...|$|R
40|$|Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) organisms {{belong to}} a {{diarrhea}}genic pathotype known to cause diarrhea and can be characterized by distinct <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> (AA) in a stacked-brick pattern to cultured epithelial cells. In this study, we in-vestigated 118 EAEC strains isolated from the stools of Danish adults with traveler’s diarrhea. We evaluated {{the presence of the}} <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbriae</b> (AAFs) by a multiplex PCR, targeting the four known major subunit variants as well as their usher-encoding genes. Almost one-half (49 / 118) of the clinical isolates did not possess any known AAF major fimbrial subunit, despite the presence of other AggR-related loci. Further investigation revealed the presence of an AAF-related gene encoding a yet-uncharacterized adhesin, termed agg 5 A. The sequence of the agg 5 DCBA gene cluster shared fimbrial accessory genes (usher, chaperone, and minor pilin subunit genes) with AAF/III, as well as the signal peptide present {{in the beginning of the}} agg 3 A gene. The complete agg 5 DCBA gene cluster from a clinical isolate, EAEC strain C 338 - 14, with the typical stacked-brick binding pat-tern was cloned, and deletion of the cluster was performed. Transformation to a nonadherent E. coli HB 101 and complementa-tion of the nonadherent C 338 - 14 mutant with the complete gene cluster restored the AA adhesion. Overall, we found the agg 5 A gene in 12 % of the 118 strains isolated from Denmark, suggesting that this novel adhesin represents an important variant. During the past decades, enteroaggregative Escherichia coli(EAEC) has emerged as an important pathogen, causing di-arrhea in adults and children in both industrialized and nonindus-trialized countries (1 – 5). Moreover, EAEC has also been linked t...|$|R
40|$|The so far {{highest number}} of {{life-threatening}} hemolytic uremic syndrome {{was associated with a}} food-borne outbreak in 2011 in Germany which was caused by an enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) of the rare serotype O 104 :H 4. Most importantly, the outbreak strain harbored genes characteristic of both EHEC and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC). Such strains have been described seldom but due to the combination of virulence genes show a high pathogenicity potential. To evaluate the importance of EHEC/EAEC hybrid strains in human disease, we analyzed the EHEC strain collection of the German National Reference Centre for Salmonella and other Bacterial Enteric Pathogens (NRC). After exclusion of O 104 :H 4 EHEC/EAEC strains, out of about 2400 EHEC strains sent to NRC between 2008 and 2012, two strains exhibited both EHEC and EAEC marker genes, specifically were stx 2 and aatA positive. Like the 2011 outbreak strain, one of the novel EHEC/EAEC harbored the Shiga toxin gene type stx 2 a. The strain was isolated from a patient with bloody diarrhea in 2010, was serotyped as O 59 :H 2, belonged to MLST ST 1136, and exhibited genes for type IV <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbriae</b> (AAF). The second strain was isolated from a patient with diarrhea in 2012, harbored stx 2 b, was typed as Orough:H 2, and belonged to MLST ST 26. Although the strain conferred the <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> phenotype, no known AAF genes corresponding to fimbrial types I to V were detected. In summary, EHEC/EAEC hybrid strains are currently rarely isolated from human disease cases in Germany and two novel EHEC/EAEC of rare serovars/MLST sequence types were characterized...|$|R
40|$|Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) are {{characterized}} by <b>aggregative</b> patterns of <b>adherence</b> and are a known cause of severe diarrhea in children of developing countries. EAEC strain 60 A was originally isolated from a child with diarrhea in Mexico and contains a virulence plasmid termed pLMJ 50. The plasmid contains 90, 299 base pairs of DNA and encodes more than 100 genes. pLMJ 50 was marked with a chloramphenicol resistance gene and was shown to confer autoaggregation and biofilm formation, as well as virulence in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Our goal is to determine which genes on pLMJ 50 are responsible for pathogenicity. Tests run thus far have shown that pLMJ 50 carries genes predicted to encode <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbriae,</b> the Aap dispersin and its secretion system, the AggR regulator and a serine protease autotransporter precursor. A tranposon insertion mutagenesis library was used to confirm the contributions {{of some of these}} genes to C. elegans virulence. Other genes found on this plasmid include conjugative transfer genes, plasmid maintenance genes, open reading frames most likely of bacteriophage origin, and multiple insertion elements flanking putative virulence genes. Plasmids isolated from other naturally occurring EAEC strains have exhibited some, but not all of the genes that we have found on pLMJ 50. Interestingly, sequencing of pLMJ 50 has also shown that it lacks toxin genes located in other EAEC strains. The data suggest that EAEC plasmids are virulence gene mosaics and this project presents a strategy for functional annotation of small genomes that could be applied to other virulence plasmids...|$|R
40|$|Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is {{a leading}} cause of acute and {{persistent}} diarrhea worldwide. A recently emerged Shiga-toxin-producing strain of EAEC resulted in significant mortality and morbidity due to progressive development of hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The attachment of EAEC to the human intestinal mucosa is mediated by <b>aggregative</b> <b>adherence</b> <b>fimbria</b> (AAF). Using X-ray crystallography and NMR structures, we present new atomic resolution insight into the structure of AAF variant I from the strain that caused the deadly outbreak in Germany in 2011, and AAF variant II from archetype strain 042, and propose a mechanism for AAF-mediated adhesion and biofilm formation. Our work shows that major subunits of AAF assemble into linear polymers by donor strand complementation where a single minor subunit is inserted {{at the tip of the}} polymer by accepting the donor strand from the terminal major subunit. Whereas the minor subunits of AAF have a distinct conserved structure, AAF major subunits display large structural differences, affecting the overall pilus architecture. These structures suggest a mechanism for AAF-mediated adhesion and biofilm formation. Binding experiments using wild type and mutant subunits (NMR and SPR) and bacteria (ELISA) revealed that despite the structural differences AAF recognize a common receptor, fibronectin, by employing clusters of basic residues at the junction between subunits in the pilus. We show that AAF-fibronectin attachment is based primarily on electrostatic interactions, a mechanism not reported previously for bacterial adhesion to biotic surfaces...|$|R
