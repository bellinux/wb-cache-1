5|$|Amartya Sen’s {{cooperative}} conflicts {{approach to}} gender biases frames women’s gender disadvantage through three different responses: breakdown wellbeing, perceived interest <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> contribution responses. The breakdown well-being response—derived from the Nash equilibrium—describes breakdown positions between individuals during cooperative decisions. When the breakdown position of one individual {{is less than}} the other person, the solution to any conflict will ultimately result in less favourable conditions for the first individual. In terms of women’s health in India, the overall gender disadvantage facing women—represented by cultural and societal factors that favour men over women—negatively impacts their ability to make decisions with regards to seeking out healthcare.|$|E
5|$|As a cardinal, Paul had {{previously}} maintained neutrality between {{the great powers}} of Spain and France that had dominated the previous conclave and {{were present in the}} current one as well. While he had been the papal envoy to Spain and was receiving a pension from them, he was largely low profile as a cardinal <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> as neutral. At 52, Paul was young {{at the time of his}} election, and was anticipated to have a lengthy papacy, not requiring a third conclave soon.|$|E
5|$|Between October and December 2005, Stefani toured North America in her Harajuku Lovers Tour 2005 {{to promote}} Love. Angel. Music. Baby., {{performing}} 37 {{shows in the}} United States and five in Canada. Her opening acts included Ciara, M.I.A. and The Black Eyed Peas. Her performances received mixed reviews from critics, with criticism about her lack of musical material, frequent costume changes <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> inability to dance, but praise for her stage presence and elaborate costumes. Stefani finished the recording of her second album, The Sweet Escape, in late 2006, having recorded some of the material in 2005, suspended the project due to pregnancy, and resumed recording in summer 2006.|$|E

5|$|Its game {{engine was}} carried over from a failed {{attempt at a}} flight {{simulator}} and was inspired by Matchbox toys and Choplifter. Jungle Strike retained its predecessor's core mechanics and expanded on the model with additional vehicles and settings. The game was well received by most critics upon release, with the Mega Drive release receiving critical acclaim from their respective reviewers. Publications praised its gameplay, strategy, design, controls and graphics, although there were some complaints regarding the interface, difficulty <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> jingoistic politics.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{relationship}} between Lie and Gerhardsen grew cooler. Gerhardsen was becoming far more amenable to the Soviets {{in part due to}} the influence of his wife, Werna, who was highly sympathetic to the Soviet Union (some even claiming she was a KGB informant). Gerhardsen had grown more and more frustrated at Lie's hard-line tactics against communists <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> Soviet sympathisers, as well as his attempts to stifle foreign policy debate within the Central Committee. Lie on his part grew embittered over what he perceived was the Gerhardsen-couple protecting key leftists, such as Trygve Bull. According to Bull, Lie and Gerhardsen hardly spoke to each other after 1957.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer was {{transferred}} to IV Gruppe of NJG1 (IV./NJG1—4th group of the 1st Night Fighter Wing), based in the Netherlands at Leeuwarden Air Base, where he was appointed Staffelkapitän (squadron leader) of the 12. Staffel (12./NJG1—12th squadron of 1st Night Fighter Wing) on 13 August 1943. He took over command from Oberleutnant Eberhard Gardiewski, who had been taken prisoner of war. At the time, IV./NJG1 was {{under the leadership of}} Gruppenkommandeur (Group Commander) Hauptmann Hans-Joachim Jabs. Jabs' first impression of Schnaufer was not entirely favourable. Shortly after Schnaufer's arrival, on one of his first missions in Leeuwarden, Schnaufer had taken right of way during taxiing. This forced Jabs into second place in order of takeoff, an act of insubordination <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> as arrogant by Jabs.|$|E

5|$|Sinclair eschewed {{the sound}} and lyrical content of her debut album Perfectionist (2011) in favour of a heavier atmosphere, driven by strong {{percussion}} and electric guitars. The lyrics, largely co-written by Sinclair and Bhasker, explore the former's problematic childhood and adolescence. Accompanying the album, its cover art was designed by Sinclair and symbolizes the album's main themes. Upon release, music critics commended the album's cohesion, <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> an evolution in Sinclair' songwriting.|$|E
5|$|The disquilibrium <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> {{corruption}} of the electoral and political process led, in 1966, to back-to-back military coups. The first coup was in January 1966 and was led by Igbo soldiers under Majors Emmanuel Ifeajuna and Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu. The coup plotters succeeded in murdering Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Premier Ahmadu Bello of the Northern Region and Premier Ladoke Akintola of the Western Region. But, the coup plotters struggled to form a central government. President Nwafor Orizu handed over government control to the Army, then {{under the command of}} another Igbo officer, General JTU Aguiyi-Ironsi.|$|E
5|$|ZANU-PF won a {{landslide}} victory, with 61% {{of the presidential}} vote and over two-thirds of parliamentary seats. The elections were not considered free and fair; there were widespread stories of vote rigging and many voters may have been fearful of the violence that had surrounded the 2008 election. During the campaign, many MDC supporters had remained quiet about their views {{out of fear of}} reprisals. The MDC was also negatively impacted by its time in coalition government, with perceptions that it had been just as corrupt as ZANU-PF. ZANU-PF had also capitalised on its appeals to African race, land, and liberation, while the MDC was often associated with white farmers, Western nations, <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> Western values such as LGBT rights.|$|E

5|$|After his succession, Charles quarrelled {{with the}} Parliament of England, {{which sought to}} curb his royal prerogative. Charles {{believed}} in the divine right of kings and thought he could govern according to his own conscience. Many of his subjects opposed his policies, in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent, <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> his actions as those of a tyrannical absolute monarch. His religious policies, coupled with his marriage to a Roman Catholic, generated the antipathy and mistrust of reformed {{groups such as the}} English Puritans and Scottish Covenanters, who thought his views too Catholic. He supported high church ecclesiastics, such as Richard Montagu and William Laud, and failed to aid Protestant forces successfully during the Thirty Years' War. His attempts to force the Church of Scotland to adopt high Anglican practices led to the Bishops' Wars, strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments and helped precipitate his own downfall.|$|E
5|$|In 1750 as {{a result}} of the Treaty of Madrid seven {{missions}} in present-day Rio Grande do Sul state in Brazil were transferred from Spanish to Portuguese control. The native Guaraní tribes were unhappy to see their lands turned over to Portugal (their enemy for over a century) and they rebelled against the decision, leading to the Guarani War. In Europe, where the Jesuits were under attack, they were accused of supporting the rebellion <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> as defending the native peoples. In 1758, the Jesuits were accused of a conspiracy to kill the king of Portugal, known as the Távora affair. All members of the Society of Jesus were evicted from Portuguese territories in 1759, and from French territories in 1764. In 1766 Jesuits were accused of causing Esquilache Riots in Madrid; consequently in February 1767, Charles III of Spain signed a royal decree with expulsion orders for all members of the Society of Jesus in Spanish territories.|$|E
5|$|In September 1918, Sovnarkom {{passed a}} decree that inaugurated the Red Terror, {{a system of}} {{repression}} orchestrated by the Cheka. Although sometimes described {{as an attempt to}} eliminate the entire bourgeoisie, Lenin did not want to exterminate all members of this class, merely those who sought to reinstate their rule. The majority of the Terror's victims were well-to-do citizens or former members of the Tsarist administration; others were non-bourgeois anti-Bolsheviks <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> social undesirables such as prostitutes. The Cheka claimed the right to both sentence and execute anyone whom it deemed to be an enemy of the government, without recourse to the Revolutionary Tribunals. Accordingly, throughout Soviet Russia the Cheka carried out killings, often in large numbers. For example, the Petrograd Cheka executed 512 people in a few days. There are no surviving records to provide an accurate figure of how many perished in the Red Terror; later estimates of historians have ranged between 10,000 and 15,000, and 50,000 to 140,000.|$|E

5|$|Kantakouzenos {{responded by}} having himself {{declared}} emperor at Didymoteicho in October 1341, while his opponents followed with the coronation of John V in November. The two coronations finalized the split, and {{ushered in a}} civil war that would embroil the Byzantine Empire and all of its neighbours until 1347 with Kantakouzenos's victory. In its course, it would devastate the remaining imperial possessions, and create a deep rift in Byzantine society: the aristocracy and the propertied classes generally supported Kantakouzenos, while the lower and middle classes, primarily urban, as well as the merchants and sailors, supported Apokaukos and the regency. This gave the dynastic dispute and civil war strong social overtones: during the war, the excessive wealth <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> indifference of Kantakouzenos and the aristocracy towards the common people became a standard fixture of Apokaukos's propaganda. In addition, the conflict acquired religious significance as well: the Hesychast controversy divided the pious Byzantines, and, despite some important exceptions, the supporters of Hesychasm also supported Kantakouzenos.|$|E
5|$|New York faced similar {{architectural}} challenges, but {{in comparison}} to Chicago, skyscraper architects worked less closely with engineers and other specialists, and instead held strong backgrounds in the Beaux Arts movement <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> their role to be primarily artistic rather than {{a partnership with the}} mechanical arts. Their practices tended to be smaller, resembling atelier style workshops. Structural engineers in New York took longer to build up a strong professional role there, a trend reflected in the lower engineering quality of many early skyscrapers in the city. The New York style emphasized stunning height and a somewhat eclectic use of architectural features from other periods, creating an energetic, flamboyant appearance. Towers were common, making best use of the relatively small plots of land in New York. Some New York skyscrapers emulated the tripartite style of Chicago, but others broke their exterior down into many different layers, each with its own style. Proponents argued that this reintroduced a sense of human proportion to these tall buildings; critics felt that the results were confusing and ungainly.|$|E
5|$|The pain pathway {{is mostly}} {{transmitted}} via myelinated Aδ (sharp or stabbing pain) and unmyelinated C nerve fibers (slow, dull, aching, or burning pain) of the trigeminal nerve, which supplies sensation {{to the teeth}} and gums via many divisions and branches. Initially, pain is felt while noxious stimuli are applied (such as cold). Continued exposure decreases firing thresholds of the nerves, allowing normally non-painful stimuli to trigger pain (allodynia). Should the insult continue, noxious stimuli produce larger discharges in the nerve, perceived as more intense pain. Spontaneous pain may occur if the firing threshold is decreased so it can fire without stimulus (hyperalgesia). The physical component of pain is processed in the medullary spinal cord <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> in the frontal cortex. Because pain perception involves overlapping sensory systems and an emotional component, individual responses to identical stimuli are variable.|$|E
