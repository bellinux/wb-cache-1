5000|$|A [...] "cartridge seal" [...] is a {{prepackaged}} seal that {{is common}} in more complex applications and were originally designed for installation in equipment where a component type seal was difficult due to the equipment design. Examples of this are horizontally split and vertical pumps. In 1975 the A W Chesterton Company designed the first cartridge seal that fit pumps with varying stuffing box bore sizes and gland bolt patterns. To accomplish this the seal utilized internal centering of the stationary parts and slotted bolt holes. This [...] "generic" [...] cartridge seal could be manufactured in higher production quantities resulting in <b>a</b> <b>cartridge</b> <b>seal</b> {{that could be used}} in all applications and pumps types. Cassette seals, patent no. 6,685,191 introduced by Gold Seals, Inc., utilize a replaceable inner [...] "cassette" [...] mounted in the cartridge end plate or gland, while modular cartridge seal systems makes it possible to replace only the parts subject to wear, such as sliding faces, secondary seals and springs, while keeping the seal's hardware (gland, sleeve, bolts).Cartridge seals can suffer from clogging due to the bigger space occupied inside the stuffing box, leading to dense or charged fluids not moving enough to centrifugate the solid particles.|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 17 Since the {{introduction}} of noncontacting, gas lubricated, dual pressurized mechanical seals for process pumps over five years ago, and they have primarily been applied to ANSI pumps and other applications where the barrier pressure was below 300 psig. This pressure limit was not due to a limitation in material strength or face pattern technology as noncontacting seals have been applied in compressors at pressures well above this. The challenge came in fitting <b>a</b> dual pressurized <b>cartridge</b> <b>seal</b> into the limited size seal cavity available in most process pumps. The radial and axial dimensions of a pump seal chamber limit {{the size and shape}} of the seal faces as well as the supporting hardware needed to make <b>a</b> convenient <b>cartridge</b> <b>seal</b> design. <b>A</b> pressure responsive primary sealing ring geometry has been developed to allow a dual pressurized sealing arrangement to routinely handle pressures up to 600 psig. This pressure capability enables the dual pressurized gas seal to be utilized in applications generally found in the API market where contacting liquid lubricated seals are commonly used options. Discussed herein are the design, theoretical results obtained through the use of finite element analysis modelling and test results. Also discussed are the results of a modified API 682 qualification test and details of field installations...|$|R
5000|$|The PSS silent pistol or MSS [...] "VUL" [...] (or [...] "Wool" [...] in English) is {{the last}} {{completed}} weapon system resulting from the Soviet development of silent pistols operating on <b>a</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>cartridge</b> system. Two previous designs were considered unacceptable for use due to their limitation to two shots. Earlier systems included the MSP and SP-4M double barreled pistols. Developed around 1980, the PSS was first issued to KGB Spetsnaz in 1983. Intended for assassinations and reconnaissance, it is under production in the special weapons foundry at TsNIITochMash. PSS pistols are still in use by elite special forces units of many nations, {{as well as by}} some FSB, MVD.|$|R
50|$|The carbine was {{designed}} and patented by Ambrose Burnside, who resigned his commission in the U.S. Army to devote himself full time to working on the weapon. The carbine used <b>a</b> special brass <b>cartridge,</b> also invented by Burnside. Pressing the weapon's two trigger guards opened the breech block and allowed the user to insert <b>a</b> <b>cartridge.</b> When the trigger was pulled, the hammer struck a percussion cap and caused a spark; {{a hole in the}} base of the cartridge exposed the black powder to this spark. The unique, cone-shaped <b>cartridge</b> <b>sealed</b> the joint between the barrel and the breech. Most other breech-loading weapons of the day tended to leak hot gas when fired, but Burnside's design eliminated this problem.|$|R

5000|$|The same {{principles}} apply to artillery ammunition; guns are traditionally categorized (in English-speaking countries) as [...] "BL" [...] and [...] "QF" [...] guns, or [...] "Breechloading" [...] and [...] "Quick firing" [...] guns. [...] "BL" [...] guns are the older style, and typically use propellant {{stored in a}} number of fabric bags, the number of which can be adjusted to vary the range in some cases, as well as a separate shell that is rammed before the powder charge is placed into the breech. Large-caliber naval guns are traditionally of the [...] "BL" [...] type. Lacking <b>a</b> <b>cartridge</b> case to <b>seal</b> the breech, these guns require a complex and strong breech mechanism to safely seal the breech during firing. [...] "QF" [...] guns were a later development, usually of small to medium caliber, and came about from the need for rapid firing guns to counter torpedo boats and other small, nimble threats. A QF gun fires metallic-cased ammunition, generally with the shell fixed to it, as a single unit, just like <b>a</b> firearm <b>cartridge.</b> This allows <b>a</b> simpler breech mechanism, such as a sliding block breech, which when coupled with the easier ammunition handling and ramming procedures, allows a much higher rate of fire. Larger guns are most often BL guns, because the ammunition is so large and heavy, that even adding <b>a</b> metallic <b>cartridge</b> case would add a great deal of weight and make handling more difficult, even if you still loaded the shell and propellant separately. There have been exceptions, however; some German naval guns during WWII used fabric powder bags with just thin brass base section, to provide obturation to the breech without adding too much weight, similar to a modern plastic shotshell with a [...] "low-brass" [...] base for sealing and extraction.|$|R

40|$|<b>Sealing</b> of <b>a</b> {{microfluidic}} <b>cartridge</b> is <b>a</b> challenge, {{because the}} cartridge commonly contains heat-sensitive biomolecules that {{must also be}} protected from contamination. In addition, the objective is usually to obtain a sealing method suitable for mass production. Laser welding is a rapid technique that can be accomplished with low unit costs. Even though the technique has been widely adopted in industry, the literature on its use in microfluidic applications is not large. This paper {{is the first to}} report the effects of laser welding on the performance of the heterogeneous immunoassay in <b>a</b> polystyrene microfluidic <b>cartridge</b> in which biomolecules are immobilized into the reaction surface of the <b>cartridge</b> before <b>sealing.</b> The paper compares the immunoassay performance of microfluidic <b>cartridges</b> that are <b>sealed</b> either with an adhesive tape or by use of laser transmission welding. The model analyte used is thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The results show that the concentration curves in the laser-welded cartridges are very close to the curves in the taped cartridges. This indicates, first, that laser welding does not cause any significant reduction in immunoassay performance, and second, that the polystyrene cover does not have significant effect on the signal levels. Interestingly, the coefficients of variance between parallel samples were lower in the laser-welded cartridges than in the taped cartridges...|$|R
