25|$|The {{cause of}} lichen planus is unknown, {{but it is}} not {{contagious}} and does not involve any known pathogen. It is thought to be a T cell mediated autoimmune reaction (where the body's immune system targets its own tissues). This autoimmune process triggers apoptosis of the epithelial cells. Several cytokines are involved in lichen planus, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, interleukin-1 alpha, interleukin 6, and interleukin 8. This <b>autoimmune,</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> mediated, process is thought to be in response to some antigenic change in the oral mucosa, but a specific antigen has not been identified.|$|E
40|$|The {{goal was}} to {{identify}} HLA-DQ 8 -bound β cell epitopes important in the T cell response in autoimmune diabetes. We first identified HLA-DQ 8 (DQA 1 * 0301 /DQB 1 * 0302) β cell epitopes using a computational approach and then related their identification to CD 4 T cell responses. The computational program (TEA-DQ 8) was adapted from one previously developed for identifying peptides bound to the I-Ag 7 molecule and based on a library of naturally processed peptides bound to HLA-DQ 8 molecules of antigen-presenting cells. We then examined experimentally the response of NOD. DQ 8 mice immunized with peptides derived from the Zinc transporter 8 protein. Log-of-odds scores on peptides were experimentally validated {{as an indicator of}} peptide binding to HLA-DQ 8 molecules. We also examined previously published data on diabetic autoantigens, including glutamic acid decarboxylase- 65, insulin and insulinoma-associated antigen- 2, all tested in NOD. DQ 8 transgenic mice. In all examples, many peptides identified with a favorable binding motif generated an <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> response, but importantly many did not. Moreover, some peptides with weak-binding motifs were immunogenic. These results indicate the benefits and limitations in predicting <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> responses strictly from MHC-binding data.

40|$|SummaryFas (also {{known as}} Apo- 1 and CD 95) {{receptor}} {{has been suggested}} to control <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> expansion by triggering T cell-autonomous apoptosis. This paradigm {{is based on the}} extensive lymphoproliferation and systemic autoimmunity in mice and humans lacking Fas or its ligand. However, with systemic loss of Fas, it is unclear whether T cell-extrinsic mechanisms contribute to autoimmunity. We found that tissue-specific deletion of Fas in mouse antigen-presenting cells (APCs) was sufficient to cause systemic autoimmunity, implying that normally APCs are destroyed during immune responses via a Fas-mediated mechanism. Fas expression by APCs was increased by exposure to microbial stimuli. Analysis of mice with Fas loss restricted to <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> revealed that Fas indeed controls <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> but not <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> responding to strong antigenic stimulation. Thus, Fas-dependent elimination of APCs is a major regulatory mechanism curbing autoimmune responses and acts in concert with Fas-mediated regulation of chronically activated <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a disease}} of {{the central nervous system}} with autoimmune etiology. Susceptibility to MS is linked to viral and bacterial infections. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) {{play a significant role in}} the fragmentation of myelin basic protein (MBP) and demyelination. The splice variants of the single MBP gene are expressed in the oligodendrocytes of the central nervous system (classic MBP) and in the immune cells (Golli-MBPs). Our data suggest that persistent inflammation caused by environmental risk factors is a step to MS. We have discovered biochemical evidence suggesting the presence of the inflammatory proteolytic pathway leading to MS. The pathway involves the self-activated furin and PC 2 proprotein convertases and membrane type- 6 MMP (MT 6 -MMP/MMP- 25) that is activated by furin/PC 2. These events are followed by MMP- 25 proteolysis of the Golli-MBP isoforms in the immune system cells and stimulation of the specific <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> clones. It is likely that the passage of these <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> clones through the disrupted blood-brain barrier to the brain and the recognition of neuronal, classic MBP causes inflammation leading to the further up-regulation of the activity of the multiple individual MMPs, the massive cleavage of MBP in the brain, demyelination, and MS. In addition to the cleavage of Golli-MBPs, MMP- 25 proteolysis readily inactivates crystallin αB that is a suppressor of MS. These data suggest that MMP- 25 plays an important role in MS pathology and that MMP- 25, especially because of its restricted cell/tissue expression pattern and cell surface/lipid raft localization, is a promising drug target in MS...|$|E

Although a role for the innate immune system in driving the <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> cascade has been proposed, its nature remains elusive. We show that plasmacytoid predendritic cells (PDCs), the natural interferon (IFN) -α–producing cells, infiltrate the skin of psoriatic patients and become activated to produce IFN-α early during disease formation. In a xenograft model of human psoriasis, we demonstrate that blocking IFN-α signaling or inhibiting the ability of PDCs to produce IFN-α prevented the T cell–dependent development of psoriasis. Furthermore, IFN-α reconstitution experiments demonstrated that PDC-derived IFN-α is essential to drive the development of psoriasis in vivo. These findings uncover a novel innate immune pathway for triggering a common human autoimmune disease and suggest that PDCs and PDC-derived IFN-α represent potential early targets for the treatment of psoriasis...|$|E

The immunological phenotype consists of the oligoclonal expansion of TCRγδ T cells combined with TCRαβ T cell lymphopenia. The clinical phenotype consists of severe, disseminated CMV infection and autoimmune blood cell manifestations. Repertoire studies suggest that CMV infection, in the setting of this particular T cell immunodeficiency, may have driven the TCRγδ T cell clonal expansion. This observation extends the range of clinical and immunological phenotypes associated with RAG mutations, emphasizing the role of the genetic background and microbial environment in determining disease phenotype...|$|E
40|$|NOD mice spontaneously develop type I {{diabetes}} {{resulting from}} autoimmune destruction of their insulin-producing b cells. Among the self-antigens targeted by NOD <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> is a peptide, p 277, from {{the sequence of}} the 60 kDa heat shock protein (hsp 60). Common to the anti-p 277 <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> populations of NOD mice is an idiotope, C 9, that spans the CDR 3 region of the C 9 TCR. We now report: (i) that the C 9 idiotope peptide can be presented directly to anti-C 9 anti-idiotypic <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> by C 9 <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> (ii) that spontaneous anti-C 9 anti-idiotypic <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> activity falls as disease progresses, but immunization can activate the anti-idiotypic <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> to regulate the autoimmune process, (iii) that the anti-idiotypic <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> secrete IFN-g, but appear to control the disease by down-regulating the IFN-g produced by the pathogenic population of anti-p 277 <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> (iv) that intrathymic administration of the C 9 idiotope peptide at 1 week of age can accelerate the disease, and (v) that administering the p 277 target peptide can up-regulate the anti-idiotypic <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> and arrest the disease process. Thus, the development of NOD diabetes can be regulated by a balance between anti-idiotypic and anti-target peptide autoimmunity, and anti-idiotypic regulation can lead {{to changes in the}} cytokine secretion of the <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> involved in the disease process...|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of genetic {{and environmental factors}} can cause autoimmune disease in animals. SKG mice, which are genetically prone to develop autoimmune arthritis, fail to develop the disease under a microbially clean condition, despite active thymic production of arthritogenic <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> and their persistence in the periphery. However, in the clean environment, a single intraperitoneal injection of zymosan, a crude fungal β-glucan, or purified β-glucans such as curdlan and laminarin can trigger severe chronic arthritis in SKG mice, but only transient arthritis in normal mice. Blockade of Dectin- 1, a major β-glucan receptor, can prevent SKG arthritis triggered by β-glucans, which strongly activate dendritic cells in vitro in a Dectin- 1 –dependent but Toll-like receptor-independent manner. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment against fungi can prevent SKG arthritis in an arthritis-prone microbial environment. Multiple injections of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid double-stranded RNA also elicit mild arthritis in SKG mice. Thus, specific microbes, including fungi and viruses, may evoke autoimmune arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis by stimulating innate immunity in individuals who harbor potentially arthritogenic <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> {{as a result of}} genetic anomalies or variations...|$|R

40|$|Although {{plasmacytoid}} dendritic cells (pDCs) express major {{histocompatibility complex}} class II (MHCII) molecules, and can capture, process, and present antigens (Ags), direct demonstrations that they function as professional Ag-presenting cells (APCs) in vivo during ongoing immune responses remain lacking. We demonstrate that mice exhibiting a selective abrogation of MHCII expression by pDCs develop exacerbated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) {{as a consequence of}} enhanced priming of encephalitogenic CD 4 (+) T cell responses in secondary lymphoid tissues. After EAE induction, pDCs are recruited to lymph nodes and establish MHCII-dependent myelin-Ag-specific contacts with CD 4 (+) T cells. These interactions promote the selective expansion of myelin-Ag-specific natural regulatory T cells that dampen the <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> response. pDCs thus function as APCs during the course of EAE and confer a natural protection against autoimmune disease development that is mediated directly by their ability to present of Ags to CD 4 (+) T cells in vivo...|$|E

While different T cell assays are being developed for these purposes, it is important to optimize and standardizemethods for processing human blood samples for these assays. To this end, we review data relevant to critical parameters in peripheral bloodmononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation, (cryo) preservation, distribution and usage for detecting antigen-specific T cell responses. Based on these data, we propose recommendations on processing blood samples for T cell assays and identify gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed.

40|$|Several of the {{naturally}} occurring autoimmune diseases have experimental correlates induced in laboratory animals by immunization with specific {{components of the}} target organ (1 - 3). The ensuing disease is proof that self-reactive cells are not always deleted from the repertoire, but circulate and can be activated in the periphery. Among those inducible diseases believed to be T cell mediated, {{it has been observed}} that clinical and histological symptoms of disease are sometimes more easily induced with heterologous antigen than with the homologous self-antigen (4 - 7). Studies on the specificity of the resulting <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> populations indicate a concordantly higher degree of responsiveness to the heterologous antigens than to the self-antigen (8, 9). This lends support to the hypothesis that the autoreactive T cells that escape from the thymus and circulate in the periphery have a relatively low affinity for self and therefore may not be activated by physiological levels of self-antigen, although they may exhibit higher affinities for closely related non-self antigens.

40|$|A select {{population}} of autoimmune T-helper (TH) cells drive {{the production of}} pathogenic anti-DNA autoantibodies in SLE. These TH cells recognize nucleosomal peptides that are processed and presented by the anti-DNA B cells that they help. The critical peptide epitopes for the TH cells reside in the core histones of the nucleosome particle. Remarkably, the nucleosomal peptide epitopes do not obey the rule of MHC-restriction; they can be promiscuously presented and recognized {{in the context of}} diverse MHC alleles. Such promiscuous antigens, called pantigens, are also recognized by <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> in a degenerate fashion, and this promiscuous recognition is conferred by the lupus TCR a chains. High-affinity interactions between the lupus TCRs and MHC-nucleosomal peptide complex due to reciprocally charged residues probably overcome the requirement for MHC restriction. These studies open up the possibility of developing ‘universally’ tolerogenic epitopes for therapy of lupus in humans despite their diversity of HLA alleles. The results also have profound implications regarding the selection of <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in the lupus-prone thymus and their expansion in the periphery. Furthermore, the TH cells, as well as B cells of lupus, have a regulatory defect causing markedly increased and prolonged expression of CD 40 ligand (CD 40 L), which mediates abnormal co-stimulatory signals to autoimmune B cells...|$|R

The Lewis rat mounts a vigorous RT 1 B 1 (major histocompatibility complex class II) restricted autoimmune response to an immunodominant S 100 beta epitope (amino acid residues 76 - 91). The adoptive transfer of S 100 beta-specific T cell lines induced a severe inflammatory response in the nervous system, but only minimal neurological dysfunction in naive syngeneic recipients. The inability of S 100 beta-specific T cell transfer to induce severe disease {{was associated with a}} decreased recruitment of ED 1 + macrophages into the central nervous system (CNS) in comparison with that seen in severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by the adoptive transfer of myelin basic protein (MBP) -specific T line cells. Moreover, unlike encephalitogenic MBP-specific T cell lines, S 100 beta-specific T cell lines exhibited no cytotoxic activity in vitro. Histopathological analysis also revealed striking differences in the distribution of inflammatory lesions in MBP- and S 100 beta-specific T cell-mediated disease. In contrast to the MBP paradigm, S 100 beta-specific T cell transfer induces intense inflammation not only in the spinal cord, but throughout the entire CNS and also in the uvea and retina of the eye. In view of the distribution of lesions throughout the grey and white matter of the CNS we propose to term this new model experimental autoimmune panencephalomyelitis (EAP) to differentiate it from EAE. These experiments demonstrate {{for the first time that}} nonmyelin CNS autoantigens can initiate a pathogenic <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> response, although the nature of the target autoantigen profoundly influences the clinical and histopathological characteristics of the resulting autoimmune disease. This is not simply a consequence of the distribution of the autoantigen, as both MBP and S 100 beta are coexpressed in many areas of the CNS, but reflects differences in the capacity of different regions of the CNS to process and present specific autoantigens. This new model of T cell-mediated autoimmune CNS disease exhibits a number of similarities to multiple sclerosis (MS), such as its mild clinical course and the involvement of areas of the brain and eye, which are absent in myelin-mediated models of EAE. Nonmyelin autoantigens may therefore play an unexpectedly important role in the immunopathogenesis of inflammatory diseases of the CNS...|$|E

As iNKT cell-plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) cooperation controls viral replication in the pancreatic islets, we investigated whether this cellular cross talk could interfere with T 1 D development during viral infection.

These tolerogenic pDCs convert naive anti-islet T cells into Foxp 3 (+) CD 4 (+) regulatory T cells (T reg cells) in pancreatic LNs. T reg cells are then recruited into the pancreatic islets where they produce TGF-β, which dampens the activity of viral- and islet-specific CD 8 (+) T cells, thereby preventing T 1 D development in both T 1 D models.

Recent data indicate that CNS autoimmunity can be mediated by two distinct lineages of CD 4 + T cells that are defined by the production of either interferon-γ or interleukin- 17. The activity of these CD 4 + T cell subsets within the CNS influences the pathology and clinical course of disease. New animal models show that myelin-specific CD 8 + T cells can also mediate CNS autoimmunity. This Review focuses on recent progress in delineating the pathogenic mechanisms, regulation and interplay between these different T cell subsets in CNS autoimmunity. <b>Autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> responses directed against antigens that are derived from the central nervous system (CNS) are thought to trigger several diseases, including multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Multiple sclerosis is the most common of these diseases, affecting more than one million people worldwide 1. Multiple sclerosis is thought to occur in genetically predisposed individuals following exposure to an environmental trigger that activates myelin- specific T cells, which allows the T cells to cross the blood–brain barrier. Reactivation of the T cells by CNS-resident antigen-presenting cell...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of antigen-specific T cell populations by {{flow cytometry}} with peptide-MHC (pMHC) multimers is now commonplace. These {{reagents}} allow the tracking and phenotyping of T cells during infection, autoimmunity and cancer, {{and can be}} particularly revealing when used for monitoring therapeutic interventions. In 2009, we reviewed a number of ‘tricks’ {{that could be used}} to improve this powerful technology. More recent advances have demonstrated the potential benefits of using higher order multimers and of ‘boosting’ staining by inclusion of an Ab against the pMHC multimer. These developments now allow staining of T cells where the interaction between the pMHC and the T cell receptor (TCR) is over 20 -fold weaker (KD > 1 mM) than could previously be achieved. Such improvements are particularly relevant when using pMHC multimers to stain anticancer or <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> populations, which tend to bear lower affinity TCRs. Here, we update our previous work to include discussion of newer tricks that can produce substantially brighter staining even when using log-fold lower concentrations of pMHC multimer. We further provide a practical guide to using pMHC multimers that includes a description of several common pitfalls and how to circumvent them...|$|E
40|$|Organ-specific {{autoimmune}} {{diseases such}} as gastritis, oophoritis, thyroiditis, or insulitis developed in athymic nu/nu mice after engraftment of the thymus from euthymic nu/+ mice treated with cyclosporin A (CsA), a potent immuno-suppressant. The development of autoimmune disease in the nu/nu mice was prevented by inoculation of thymocyte suspensions prepared from normal nu/+ mice, but not by thymocyte suspensions from CsA-treated nu/+ mice. Cotransplantation of normal nu/+ mouse thymus with CsA-treated thymus also suppressed the development of autoimmune disease. Inoculation of spleen cell suspensions prepared from normal adult nu/+ mice prevented autoimmune disease, but inoculation of those from newborn nu/+ mice did not. Thus, CsA appears to interfere selectively with the thymic production of certain suppressor <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> controlling self-reactive (<b>autoimmune)</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> allowing the latter to expand and cause autoimmune disease...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile {{diabetes}} (type 1) is an {{autoimmune disease}} in which CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> {{play a major}} role in pathogenesis characterized by insulitis and β cell destruction leading to clinical hyperglycemia. To date, no marker for <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> has been described, although it was previously demonstrated that autoimmune mice have a large population of CD 4 + cells that express CD 40. We show here that established, diabetogenic <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> clones of either the Th 1 or Th 2 phenotype are CD 40 -positive, whereas nondiabetogenic clones are CD 40 -negative. CD 40 functionally signals <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> clones, inducing rapid activation of the transcription factor NFκB. We show that autoimmune diabetes-prone nonobese diabetic mice have high levels of CD 40 +CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in the thymus, spleen, and importantly, in the pancreas. Finally, as demonstrated by adoptive transfers, CD 4 +CD 40 + cells infiltrate the pancreatic islets causing β-cell degranulation and ultimately diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Partial {{injury to}} the spinal cord can {{propagate}} itself, sometimes leading to paralysis attributable to degeneration of initially undamaged neurons. We demonstrated recently that <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> directed against the CNS antigen myelin basic protein (MBP) reduce degeneration after optic nerve crush injury in rats. Here we show that not only transfer of <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> but also active immunization with MBP promotes recovery from spinal cord injury. Anesthetized adult Lewis rats subjected to spinal cord contusion at T 7 or T 9, using the New York University impactor, were injected systemically with anti-MBP <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> {{at the time of}} contusion or 1 week later. Another group of rats was immunized, 1 week before contusion, with MBP emulsified in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA). Functional recovery was assessed in a randomized, double-blinded manner, using the open-field behavioral test of Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan. The functional outcom...|$|R
