40|$|The {{building}} industry is involved directly and considerably {{in the new}} production of the cultural real estate and in the restoration and the unkeep of the one already built-up. Neither the historic buildings, nor the cultural ones, nor the artistic ones, have ever been quantified, even though one estimates {{that there are more}} than 40 % of the domestic buildings liable to be preserved. Besides, not only the cultural heritage, that is the real estate and the personal estate, could be preserved and so legally bound, but also the landscape and the environment. Due to its strategic importance in relation to the country development, the industrial system, which satisfies the need of preserving (and increasing) the enormous <b>artistic</b> real <b>estate,</b> requires a specific industrial policy and back-up measures. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCultural {{heritage}} {{belonging to}} religious institutions represents {{a significant part}} of the whole <b>artistic</b> <b>estate</b> of our country. Today, one of the main problem affecting the church properties is in the abandoning of those places - due both to the loosing of their old use and their closing to the public. The perspective for this kind of heritage is sometimes to get a new function, or to suffer degradation and demolition. Religious architectures are still today an exceptional part of the landscape. They survived through many centuries, even if they lost their original dedicated value. The religious heritage was part of a cultural and perceptive net that is still today an immaterial inheritance, as we can see it in the landscape nowadays. This kind of approach, based on a multidisciplinary contribution, allows the understanding of traces continuity in landscapes. And even traces that today are lost, they are still part of a cultural set. Thankfully to devotional paths, we are able to recreate the ancient images of places and their territorial value.

40|$|Tese de mestrado, Escultura Pública, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Belas Artes, 2012 Arlindo Gonçalves da Rocha, {{sculptor}} born in Oporto, was {{in conjunction}} with Fernando Fernandes, {{one of the pioneers}} of abstract sculpture in Portugal. A study trip to Oporto in 2008 was the starting point of the research on the work of Arlindo Rocha, which proved to be a great <b>artistic</b> <b>estate</b> in rich and diverse materials and styles. His work raised some initial issues, in particular by the presence of two distinct artistic languages, one founded on neo-figurative values and another, more solid and innovative for its time, pioneer of a neoplastic language, in the register of Portuguese sculpture. For a better understanding of this issue, this dissertation starts an attempt to understand the time in which the sculptor lived. By knowing more about his time we can understand the reason why his first experiences of an abstractive art emerged timidly, which was intended to be modern and abstract, but remained neo-figurative. As such, this work will also look into the analysis of some sculptures by Arlindo Rocha, where we recognize a pioneer landmark, especially in the exploration of new artistic languages, which help us in understanding the overall work of this sculpto...|$|E
