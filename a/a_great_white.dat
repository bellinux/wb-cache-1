5|$|Jaws is a 1974 {{novel by}} American writer Peter Benchley. It {{tells the story}} of <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark that preys upon a small resort town and the voyage of three men trying to kill it. The novel grows out of Benchley's {{interest}} in shark attacks after he learned about the exploits of shark fisherman Frank Mundus in 1964. Doubleday commissioned him to write the novel in 1971, a period when Benchley struggled as a freelance journalist.|$|E

Its biologists have pioneered the animal husbandry of jellyfish, and , it remains the only public aquarium to have successfully exhibited <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark for more than 16 days. The aquarium's seafood consumer awareness program has had an influential role among consumers and businesses in enhancing sustainable fishing practices.|$|E
5|$|Saturn's usually bland {{atmosphere}} occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals {{and other}} features common on Jupiter. In 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near Saturn's equator that was not present during the Voyager encounters, and in 1994 another smaller storm was observed. The 1990 storm {{was an example of}} <b>a</b> <b>Great</b> <b>White</b> Spot, a unique but short-lived phenomenon that occurs once every Saturnian year, roughly every 30 Earth years, {{around the time of the}} northern hemisphere's summer solstice. Previous Great White Spots were observed in 1876, 1903, 1933 and 1960, with the 1933 storm being the most famous. If the periodicity is maintained, another storm will occur in about 2020.|$|E

5|$|The film {{focuses on}} a now-widowed Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary) and her {{convictions}} that a shark is seeking revenge on her family, particularly when <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> follows her to the Bahamas. Jaws: The Revenge was shot on location in New England and in the Bahamas, and completed on the Universal lot. Like the first two films, Martha's Vineyard was {{the location of the}} fictional Amity Island for the opening scenes. Although preceded by Jaws 3-D, The Revenge ignores plot elements introduced in that film.|$|E
5|$|This shark's {{behavior}} and social structure {{is not well}} understood. In South Africa, white sharks have a dominance hierarchy depending on the size, sex and squatter's rights: Females dominate males, larger sharks dominate smaller sharks, and residents dominate newcomers. When hunting, great whites tend to separate and resolve conflicts with rituals and displays. White sharks rarely resort to combat although some individuals have been found with bite marks that match those of other white sharks. This suggests that when <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> approaches too closely to another, they react with a warning bite. Another possibility is that white sharks bite to show their dominance.|$|E
5|$|Tiger {{shark teeth}} are unique with very sharp, {{pronounced}} serrations and an unmistakable sideways pointing tip. Such dentition has developed to slice through flesh, bone, and other tough substances such as turtle shells. Like most sharks, its teeth are continually replaced by rows of new teeth throughout the sharks life. Relative to the shark's size, tiger shark teeth are considerably shorter {{than those of}} <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark, however they are nearly as broad as the root as the great whites teeth and are arguably better suited to slicing through hard-surfaced prey.|$|E

5|$|The {{great white}} shark has a robust, large, conical snout. The upper and lower lobes on the tail fin are {{approximately}} the same size {{which is similar to}} some mackerel sharks. <b>A</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> displays countershading, by having a white underside and a grey dorsal area (sometimes in a brown or blue shade) that gives an overall mottled appearance. The coloration makes it difficult for prey to spot the shark because it breaks up the shark's outline when seen from the side. From above, the darker shade blends with the sea and from below it exposes a minimal silhouette against the sunlight. Great white sharks, like many other sharks, have rows of serrated teeth behind the main ones, ready to replace any that break off. When the shark bites, it shakes its head side-to-side, helping the teeth saw off large chunks of flesh.|$|E
5|$|The soft fins, skin, and {{musculature}} of {{the false}} catshark suggest a sluggish lifestyle. An enormous oil-filled liver makes up 18–25% of its total weight, allowing it to maintain near-neutral buoyancy and hover off the bottom with little effort. This species likely captures prey via quick bursts of speed, with its large mouth allowing it to consume food of considerable size. It feeds mainly on bony fishes such as cutthroat eels, grenadiers, and snake mackerel, and also takes lanternsharks, squids, octopodes, and Heterocarpus shrimp. It likely also scavenges, as examination of stomach contents have found surface-dwelling fishes such as frigate mackerel, needlefishes, and pufferfishes. One specimen caught off the Canary Islands had swallowed human garbage, including potatoes, a pear, a plastic bag, and a soft drink can. There is a record of a false catshark found with bite marks from <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark (Carcharodon carcharias).|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} of Abzû is told wordlessly through gameplay and using cutscenes, {{taking place in}} a vast ocean. The player character, {{referred to as a}} female diver, awakens floating in the ocean and begins exploring the surrounding sea: ruins and ancient murals show that an ancient civilization which shared a symbiotic connection with the ocean. As she explores, she is led by <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark to wells that—when activated using an energy from within her—restore life to the local seas. That energy is being forcefully harvested by pyramid-like devices, the development of which disrupted the ocean's balance and brought about the civilization's downfall. Upon reaching the original pyramid, the diver sees the great white shark attacking it, and the pyramid's counterattack damages the diver—revealing her to be mechanical and confirming her existence as a being connected to the pyramid and capable of restoring life to the ocean—and mortally wounds the great white shark, which dies as the diver comforts it. After activating the final well, the great white shark manifests and guides the repaired diver back to the pyramid. The diver destroys the pyramid, causing life to return to the ocean. During the credits, the diver and great white shark swim together through the revitalized ocean.|$|E

Its general appearance was not unlike that of the familiar, pictorial beehive except that the rolls were not arranged spirally.

25|$|Large sharks {{species are}} apex predators in their environment, {{and thus have}} little fear of any {{creature}} (other than orcas) with which they cross paths. Like most sophisticated hunters, they are curious when they encounter something unusual in their territories. Lacking any limbs with sensitive digits such as hands or feet, {{the only way they}} can explore an object or organism is to bite it; these bites are known as test bites. Generally, shark bites are exploratory, and the animal will swim away after one bite. For example, exploratory bites on surfers are thought to be caused by the shark mistaking the surfer and surfboard for the shape of prey. Nonetheless, a single bite can grievously injure a human if the animal involved is a powerful predator such as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> or tiger shark.|$|E

5|$|However, some {{researchers}} have hypothesized that the reason the proportion of fatalities is low is not because sharks do not like human flesh, but because humans are often able to escape after the first bite. In the 1980s, John McCosker, Chair of Aquatic Biology at the California Academy of Sciences, noted that divers who dove solo and were bitten by <b>great</b> <b>whites</b> were generally at least partially consumed, while divers who followed the buddy system were generally rescued by their companion. McCosker and Timothy C. Tricas, an author and professor at the University of Hawaii, suggest that a standard pattern for <b>great</b> <b>whites</b> is to make an initial devastating attack and then wait for the prey to weaken before consuming the wounded animal. Humans' ability {{to move out of}} reach with the help of others, thus foiling the attack, is unusual for <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>white's</b> prey.|$|R
