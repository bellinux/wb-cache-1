500|$|Tchaikovsky {{allowed the}} first version to be premiered by Nikolai Rubinstein on March 16, 1870, after the {{composer}} had incorporated only some of Balakirev's suggestions. The premiere was a disaster. Stung by this rejection, Tchaikovsky took Balakirev's strictures to heart. He forced himself to reach beyond his musical training and rewrote much of the music into the form we know it today. Romeo would bring Tchaikovsky his first national and international acclaim and become a work the kuchka lauded unconditionally. On hearing the love theme from Romeo, Stasov told the group, [...] "There were five of you; now there are six". Such was the enthusiasm of the Five for Romeo that at their gatherings Balakirev was <b>always</b> <b>asked</b> to play it through at the piano. He did this {{so many times that}} he learned to perform it from memory.|$|E
500|$|A {{lot of my}} {{performances}} {{have had}} fire involved, so we thought 'Heat.' Also, red {{is one of my}} favorite colors, as is gold. So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — my mother had a collection of them when I was growing up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I <b>always</b> <b>asked</b> myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and I wanted to make sure that it was something I would love forever.|$|E

2500|$|Barada {{was known}} as a huge man, {{commonly}} thought to be almost seven feet tall and widely regarded as a giant. [...] His strength was well known as well, and he was <b>always</b> <b>asked</b> to assist with barn raising, as he would single-handedly hold heavy beams in place while they were fastened down. [...] When local farmers needed assistance loading hogs for market, they would also call on Barada. [...] Rather than use a loading chute, Barada simply picked the hogs up and set them in the wagon. [...] Every time townsfolk needed someone's strength, Barada took the call.|$|E

[...] A series of interrogators <b>always</b> <b>asked</b> the same questions, did not appear to believe his answers, and when he passed out from exhaustion, they hit him in the face and head as [...] "they couldn't think of any better way to keep me awake."

[...] Hank had been in rehab before, as well as court-mandated detox, and it had never worked. [...] Once Hank was even kicked out of Alcoholics Anonymous because he brought into the meeting a bottle of Mad Dog 20-20 and started drinking it five seconds after the meeting started. [...] Regarding trying to get Hank help for his alcoholism, Howard Stern explained, [...] "People <b>always</b> <b>asked</b> me if we {{tried to get him to}} stop drinking, and I said all the time we did..."

Junaid once told me that his biggest regret was not {{to be a part of}} Jazba Junoon's recording.

2500|$|Cowdrey was a prodigy {{who learned}} to bat {{as soon as}} he could walk thanks to his cricket-mad father. When he arrived at Tonbridge School he was placed {{immediately}} in the First XI even though he was only 13, and became the youngest cricketer to play at Lord's. He was a fine strokemaker who possessed a full array of stokes around the wicket [...] "a masterly batsman with an excellent technique he... delighted crowds throughout the world with his style and elegance". His favourite stroke was the most pleasing – the cover drive, his son Chris Cowdrey was <b>always</b> <b>asked</b> [...] "Why don't you caress the ball through extra cover like your father?" [...] and replied [...] "If I could, I would". Cowdrey also liked to experiment with new grips and unconventional strokes, to the annoyance of purists who thought his technique was already near perfect and Cowdrey himself noted that [...] "I have not been a good player when the going is easy... unless the match provided a problem to solve, a theory to test, a hurdle to leap, a challenge worthy of battle, I have never been fully plugged in".|$|E

It's just so dishonest. The biggest shows {{when we were on}} the air were All in the Family and The Mary Tyler Moore Show both of which were taped before a live studio audience where laughter made sense," [...] continued Gelbart. [...] "But our show was a film show – supposedly shot in the middle of Korea. So the question I <b>always</b> <b>asked</b> the network was, 'Who are these laughing people? Where did they come from?'" [...] Gelbart persuaded CBS to test the show in private screenings with and without the laugh track. The results showed no measurable difference in the audience's enjoyment. [...] "So you know what they said?" [...] Gelbart said. [...] "'Since there's no difference, let's leave it alone!' The people who defend laugh tracks have no sense of humor." [...] Gelbart summed up the situation by saying, [...] "I always thought it cheapened the show. The network got their way. They were paying for dinner." ...|$|E
2500|$|Allenby was {{promoted}} to temporary lieutenant general on 10 October 1914. As the BEF was expanded in size to two Armies, he was rewarded by being made commander of the Cavalry Corps. On 6 May 1915, Allenby voluntarily left the Cavalry Arm to take up command of V Corps which was engaged at that moment in severe fighting at the Second Battle of Ypres. Commanding a corps seemed to make Allenby's bad temper even worse where anything from a split infinitive in a staff paper to discovering a corpse in the field without the tin helmet that Allenby ordered his men to wear sent Allenby off into a rage. The V Corps was victorious in defeating the German assault but incurred controversially heavy losses in the process through Allenby's tactical policy of continual counter-attacks at the German attacking force. In September 1915, V Corps attempted a diversion of German strength to facilitate the concurrent British offensive at Loos. They executed a minor attack in the Hooge Sector in the Ypres Salient under Allenby's direction, which once again incurred substantial losses to its units involved in the affair. In October 1915, Allenby {{was promoted}} to lead the British Third Army, being made lieutenant-general (substantive rank) on 1 January 1916. In mid-Summer 1916, he was the Army Commander {{in support of the}} launch of the Battle of the Somme offensive, with responsibility for the abortive assault by 3rd Army troops on the trench fortress of the Gommecourt salient, which failed with severe casualties to the units under his command in the operation. By this time in 1916, Archibald Wavell who was one of Allenby's staff officers and supporters, wrote that Allenby's temper seemed to [...] "confirm the legend that 'the Bull' was merely a bad-tempered, obstinate hot-head, a 'thud-and-blunder' general". Allenby harboured doubts about the leadership of the commander of the BEF, General Sir Douglas Haig, but refused to allow any of his officers to say anything critical about Haig. However, despite Allenby's rages and obsession with applying the rules in a way that often seemed petty, Allenby's staff officers found an intellectually curious general who was interested in finding new ways of breaking the stalemate. J. F. C. Fuller called Allenby [...] "a man I grew to like and respect", a man who <b>always</b> <b>asked</b> his staff if they had any new ideas about how to win the war. Allenby had wider interests than many other British generals, reading books on every conceivable subject from botany to poetry and was noted for his critical intellect. An officer who had dinner with Allenby at his headquarters in a French château recalled: ...|$|E
