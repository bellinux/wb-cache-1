5|$|A new rift opened {{that started}} to break <b>apart</b> <b>the</b> supercontinent Rodinia, which North America {{was then a}} part of.

5|$|A second {{improvement}} project involves {{building a}} pedestrian tunnel to interconnect the Gallery Place station with Metro Center. A July 2005 study proposed connecting the eastern mezzanine of Metro Center {{with the western}} mezzanine of Gallery Place that are only one block <b>apart.</b> <b>The</b> proposed connection would {{reduce the number of}} passengers that use the Red Line to transfer between the Yellow Line and the Blue and Orange lines at Metro Center. As of 2011, the project remains unfunded.|$|E
5|$|A second {{method of}} rear delay array {{combines}} end-fire topology with polarity reversal, using two subwoofers positioned front to back, the drivers spaced one-quarter wavelength <b>apart,</b> <b>the</b> rear enclosure inverted in polarity and delayed {{by a few}} milliseconds for maximum cancellation on stage of the target frequency. This method has the least output power directed toward the audience, compared to other directional methods.|$|E
5|$|An {{extreme example}} of an {{equatorial}} bulge is found on the star Regulus A (α Leonis A). The equator of this star has a measured rotational velocity of 317±3km/s. This corresponds to a rotation period of 15.9 hours, which is 86% of the velocity at which the star would break <b>apart.</b> <b>The</b> equatorial radius of this star is 32% larger than polar radius. Other rapidly rotating stars include Alpha Arae, Pleione, Vega and Achernar.|$|E

5|$|Continents formed, {{then broke}} up and {{reformed}} as {{the surface of}} Earth reshaped over {{hundreds of millions of}} years, occasionally combining to make a supercontinent. Roughly 750million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break <b>apart.</b> <b>The</b> continents later recombined to form Pannotia which broke apart about 540million years ago, then finally Pangaea, which broke apart about 180million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Filmed in India, Mauritius, and Scotland, {{this was}} Karan Johar's directorial debut. One of his {{goals for the}} film was to set a new level for style in Hindi cinema.

5|$|Republicans in Congress {{claimed a}} mandate for abolition, having gained in the {{elections}} for Senate and House. The 1864 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Representative George H. Pendleton, led opposition to the measure. Republicans toned down their language of radical equality in order to broaden the amendment's coalition of supporters. In order to reassure critics worried that the amendment would tear <b>apart</b> <b>the</b> social fabric, some Republicans explicitly promised that the amendment would leave patriarchy intact.|$|E

The early cylindrical pylons fulfilled the first criterion but proved to be too unstable in the wind.|$|E

5|$|The {{quality of}} the rock in the Valley is inconsistent, ranging from finely-grained to coarse stone, the latter with the {{potential}} to be structurally unsound. The occasional layer of shale also caused construction and conservation difficulties, as this rock expands in the presence of water, forcing <b>apart</b> <b>the</b> stone surrounding it. It is thought that some tombs were altered in shape and size depending on the types of rock the builders encountered.|$|E

In the United States, the immediate and extended release (XR) formulations of Adderall are both available as generic drugs, while Mydayis is available only as a brand-name drug.|$|E
5|$|Adrienne's head {{is split}} open by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached {{to either side}} {{so it could be}} pulled <b>apart.</b> <b>The</b> crew only had one head model, so they had to keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.|$|E

After many years <b>apart,</b> <b>the</b> band finally united at a gig at the Royal Festival Hall and a short tour in 2005.

5|$|Although The Covent-Garden Tragedy {{appeared}} with The Old Debauchees, {{it was not}} a success like the other play and quickly dropped. The Covent Garden Tragedy was immediately ended after its first night because, according to Fielding, of the play's use of a brothel as a setting. After all, the plot focuses on a love triangle between characters in a brothel. Even though the first night fell <b>apart,</b> <b>the</b> play was later performed; it eventually appeared again for four nights with Don Quixote in England, once on its own in 1734, and a few later times during the 18th century, including as a puppet show.|$|E
5|$|As {{a last-ditch}} effort to avert a lockout, owners and players met again on June 30, 2011, to negotiate, but both sides failed to reach a {{resolution}} on key issues like salary cap and BRI splits. Both Stern and Hunter said that the two sides remained far <b>apart.</b> <b>The</b> owners demanded a larger share, claiming that they were losing money. The players, on the other hand, were willing to make concessions, but they refused to completely cave in to owners' demands. Negotiations broke off, and the CBA expired at midnight.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} bats, the little brown bat is mostly active {{at night and}} leaves its roost at dusk and {{the next two or}} three hours are peak {{activity}} periods. They are also active before dawn. Since little brown bats live in a temperate zone, they must find some way of dealing with winter. Most temperate bats either migrate or hibernate, but little brown bats do both. In summer, the males and females live <b>apart,</b> <b>the</b> females raise the young. When fall comes, both sexes fly south to a hibernaculum, where they mate and then hibernate. Little brown bats undergo a prolonged period of hibernation during the winter due to the lack of food. They hibernate in caves as a community.|$|E
