25|$|Later, in October, one of Insolents boats hit a rock, {{with the}} result that her captain and three seamen drowned. The purser's {{daughter}} was on the boat and one of the seaman swam for the shore, carrying her on his back. As he swam her clothes became sodden and he informed the young woman that unless she agreed to let him remove her clothes he could not carry her further. She refused, stating that she preferred to die than compromise her virtue. He swam on for a bit with her, still clothed, on his back, but eventually, exhausted, he had to let her go <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>her</b> drown.|$|E
500|$|Landing near Constantinople, Calafia {{meets with}} other Moslem warrior leaders who {{were unable to}} remove King Amadis and his Christian allies from the city, and she tells them all to hold back <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>her</b> manner of combat—she says they will be amazed. The next morning, she and her women warriors mount their [...] "fierce beasts" [...] wearing gold armor [...] "adorned with the most {{precious}} stones", advancing to invest the city. Calafia orders the griffins forward and they, hungry from the long sea voyage, fly out and maul the city's defenders. Sating their hunger, the griffins continue to snatch Christian men in their claws and carry them high in air only to drop them to their deaths. The city's defenders cower and hide from the griffins. Seeing this, Calafia passes word to her Moslem allies that {{they are free to}} advance and take the city. The griffins, however, cannot tell Moslem from Christian; they can only tell man from woman. The griffins begin snatching Moslem soldiers and carrying them aloft, dropping and killing them. Calafia questions her pagan faith, saying, [...] "O ye idols in whom I believe and worship, what is this which has happened as favorably to my enemies as to my friends?" [...] She orders her woman warriors to take the city's battlements and they fight well, taking many injuries from arrows and quarrels piercing the soft gold metal of their armor. Calafia orders her allies forward to assist the Californians in battle, but the griffins pounce again, killing Moslem men. She directs the griffin trainers to call them off, and the griffins return to roost in the ships.|$|E

2500|$|The few human {{interactions}} she {{was permitted}} were equally humiliating, when not dangerous. The tower warden was wont {{to visit her}} at night when he was drunk, and she was saved from his advances on one occasion only because he slumbered off in mid-embrace. Maid servants were sent to clean her cell <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>her</b> from an outer room, sending reports on her words and pastimes to the Queen. But such women as worked in prisons were apt to be hard and insolent. Leonora Christina fended off harassment from one serving wench only by threatening to kill her with her bare hands.|$|E

60|$|Pigling Bland made no objection; he {{sat with}} his eyes half shut, <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R

60|$|For {{the next}} three months Philip went every day to see Mildred. He took his books with him and after tea worked, while Mildred lay on the sofa reading novels. Sometimes he would look up <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>her</b> for a minute. A happy smile crossed his lips. She would feel his eyes upon her.|$|E
60|$|Toby had {{resolved}} to keep awake <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>her,</b> {{for he was}} struck with admiration at her face; but sleep {{got the better of}} him in less than five minutes after he had made the resolution, and he sat bolt upright, with his little round head nodding and bobbing until it seemed almost certain that he would shake it off.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} head {{at the sound of the}} biscuit tin <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> put out the {{precious}} discs.|$|R
60|$|She did not answer, {{but went}} back to the waiting group. Lucile saw <b>her</b> coming <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|R
60|$|He moved {{aside to}} let <b>her</b> pass, <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> with a heartfelt {{gratitude}} {{as she went}} slowly down a corridor.|$|R
60|$|He was curiously silent {{even after}} his {{strength}} was sufficient for speech. Content to lie on his bed <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>her</b> as she moved about him, he answered only in monosyllables, while the deep current of his love gathered below his reticence. As {{he came to a}} full understanding of what he had been and to a sense of his unworthy estimate of her and her people, his passion broke bounds.|$|E
60|$|And so had it {{happened}} to Hereward. He did not love Alftruda now: he loathed, hated, dreaded her. And yet he could not take {{his eyes for a}} moment off her beauty. He watched every movement of her hand, to press it, obey it. He would have preferred instead of hunting, simply to sit <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>her</b> go about the house at her work. He was spell-bound to a thing which he regarded with horror.|$|E
60|$|About {{this time}} the old earl dropped in for a chat with the artist, and invited him to stay to dinner. Tracy cramped down his joy and {{gratitude}} by a sudden and powerful exercise of all his forces; and he felt that {{now that he was}} going to be close to Gwendolen, and hear her voice <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>her</b> face during several precious hours, earth had nothing valuable to add to his life for the present.|$|E
60|$|She {{nodded and}} made her adieux to the Prince. The two men stood {{together}} <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> depart with her companion.|$|R
60|$|He was {{standing}} <b>watching</b> <b>her,</b> feeling his short-cut moustache, leaning back slightly <b>and</b> <b>watching</b> <b>her</b> with his keen, undaunted eyes, {{dominated by the}} constant passion, {{that was like a}} doom upon him.|$|R
60|$|I protested, {{but she was}} firm. So I {{stood by}} the gate <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> slim young figure {{disappear}} in the gathering shadows.|$|R

I've done {{my best to}} fit Rose for what may come, as far as I can foresee it, but now she must stand alone, and all my care is {{powerless}} to keep her heart from aching, her life from being saddened by mistakes, or thwarted by the acts of others. I can only stand ready to share her joy and sorrow <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>her</b> shape her life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] {{answered}} Dorian Gray. [...] "It {{was here}} I found her, {{and she is}} divine beyond all living things. When she acts you will forget everything. These common, rough people, with their coarse faces and brutal gestures, become quite different when {{she is on the}} stage. They sit silently <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>her.</b> They weep and laugh as she wills them to do. She makes them as responsive as a violin. She spiritualises them, and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one's self." ...|$|E
60|$|In the meanwhile, {{the boat}} engrossed {{more and more}} of his attention. It was a relief to drive her hard at some white-topped sea, <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>her</b> bows {{disappear}} in it with a thud, while it somehow eased his mind to see the smashed-up brine fly half the height of her drenched mainsail. There was also satisfaction in feeling the strain on the tiller when, swayed down by a fiercer gust, she plunged through the combers with the froth swirling, perilously close to the coaming, along her half-submerged deck.|$|E
60|$|He went to {{the door}} with <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> slender, trim figure walking rapidly away until it {{disappeared}} round the corner of the Square.|$|R
