5|$|On November 6, 1996 CMLL {{took the}} CMLL World Women's Championship away from then reigning {{champion}} Reina Jubuki {{because she had}} wrestled on a World Championship Wrestling (WCW) show in North America {{only a few days}} prior. At the time WCW had a working relationship with Asistencia Asesoría y <b>Administración</b> (AAA), CMLL's main rival in Mexico and thus appearing for WCW was enough for CMLL to sever ties with Jubuki. CMLL held a tournament to crown a new champion only 2 days after announcing the title being vacated, choosing four of their top female competitors for a quick four-woman tournament.|$|E
5|$|The reigning champion, La Diabólica left CMLL to join rival Asistencia Asesoría y <b>Administración</b> (AAA) on April 5, 2003 which forced CMLL {{to vacate}} the championship. This {{happened}} {{during a time}} of very low activity in CMLL's female division, which meant the title was inactive for over two years before CMLL held a tournament for the title starting on September 9, 2005. CMLL held a nine-woman torneo cibernetico elimination match to determine the two finalists that would face off the next week in a best two-out-of-three falls match. Dark Angel and Marcela survived the match and met on September 16, 2005 with Marcela winning the match and her first CMLL World Women's Championship.|$|E
5|$|Blue Panther {{was officially}} {{recognized}} as the first champion in 1991, after winning a 16-man tournament. The championship's history was interrupted in 1992 with its only , when Blue Panther left CMLL to work for rival promotion Asistencia Asesoría y <b>Administración</b> (AAA). El Dandy defeated Negro Casas in a singles match to decide the new champion. Ángel de Oro is the current CMLL World Middleweight Champion, having defeated Dragón Rojo Jr. for the championship on March 25, 2017. He is the 18th overall champion and the 14th person to hold the championship.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, CMLL left the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) but {{retained}} {{control of the}} NWA World Welterweight Championship as their main championship of the welterweight division. They also promoted the Mexican National Welterweight Championship as a secondary title for the Welterweight division. In 1991 they decided to create a series of CMLL-branded world championships, {{one of which was}} for the welterweight division. They held a four-man tournament on February 15, 1992, to crown the first welterweight champion. The participants were Fuerza Guerrera, El Felino, América and El Khalifa; in the finals, Fuerza Guerrera defeated El Khalifa to become the first champion. On July 16, 1992, the Mexican National Welterweight Champion defeated CMLL Welterweight Champion América, vacating the Mexican National Welterweight Championship. In 1993 control of the Mexican National Welterweight Championship was transferred from CMLL to rival promotion Asistencia Asesoría y <b>Administración</b> (AAA).|$|E
5|$|The Mexican National Trios Championship {{was created}} in 1985. Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL; Spanish for World Wrestling Council) was given the promotional control of the title while the Commission only have to approve the {{champion}}s. The first champion crowned was the team of Los Infernales (Spanish for The Infernals; MS-1, Pirata Morgan and El Satánico). CMLL controlled the championship from 1985 until 1994, when Asistencia Asesoría y <b>Administración</b> (AAA; Spanish for Assistance Consultancy and Administration) {{took control of the}} championship. The first champion of the AAA-controlled era was Los Hermanos Dinamita (Spanish for The Dynamite Brothers; Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000 and Universo 2000). When the AAA began to co-promote events with Promotora Mexicana de Lucha Libre (PROMELL), the title became jointly operated; when the AAA and PROMELL split up in 1996, the championship was vacated. The Commission returned the championship to CMLL, allowing them to hold a tournament to crown the new champions, the team of Blue Panther, Fuerza Guerrera and El Signo. Since 1996, the titles have been exclusively controlled by CMLL.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, 1996 {{the team}} of Blue Panther, Fuerza Guerrera and El Signo won the Mexican National Trios Championship, a {{championship}} {{that had previously been}} promoted by CMLL but by 1996 was promoted by rival promotions Asistencia Asesoría y <b>Administración</b> (AAA) and Promotora Mexicana de Lucha Libre (PROMLL). Later on, AAA and PROMLL had a falling out and the trios championship became inactive as the champions did not team up on a regular basis. After not being defended since September 1996 the trio came together again on March 30, 2002 at the 2001 Juicio Final ("Final Justice") CMLL show. The trio lost the Mexican National Trios Championship to CMLL-regulars Olímpico, Mr. Niebla and Safari, signalling that the championship was back under CMLL's control. During the summer of 2001 the CMLL based Los Boricuas (Spanish slang for people from Puerto Rico) had become on of the promotion's main rudo groups. The group was led by Pierroth Jr. and also included veteran wrestler Gran Markus Jr. as well as Violencia, Veneno, Nitro and Poder Boricua. Due to their prominent position in CMLL {{the team of}} Gran Markus Jr., Veneno and Poder Boricua were granted a match for the Mexican National Trios Championship.|$|E

The entity was reorganized as the <b>Administración</b> General de Puertos by President Raúl Alfonsín on 4 September 1987. Chronic losses, which by the early 1990s averaged over us$60 million yearly, prompted its 1992 privatization by President Carlos Menem.

Following that event El Oriental became involved in a storyline feud against Pentagón which saw El Oriental's sister Esther join him {{in the fight against}} Pentagón and his wife Xóchitl Hamada. The two met at the 2000 Rey de Reyes where Pentagón defeated El Oriental. In June 2000 Oriental teamed with his sister Esther for Triplemanía VIII, which took place in Tokyo, Japan.

25|$|The Championship {{dates back}} to 1933, {{making it one of}} the oldest {{professional}} wrestling champions still in use today predating all active titles in both North America and Japan. Records of how the first champion, Yaqui Joe, are unclear due to minimal written documentation from that period. No documentation exists that the championship was created for Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL, later renamed CMLL) but during the 1930s and '40s the promotion was granted control of the title by the Comisión. In 1992 Antonio Peña founded Asistencia Asesoría y <b>Administración</b> taking a number of CMLL wrestlers with him. One of these wrestlers was the then reigning National Middleweight Champion Octagón who took the championship with him. When Blue Panther won the championship in on July 27, 1992 it was officially acknowledged by the Commission that AAA controlled the booking of the championship from that point forward.|$|E
25|$|After Paco Alonso {{chose to}} ignore Peña's booking ideas, Peña began {{negotiations}} with Televisa television channel to fund a new wrestling promotion that would provide Televisa with weekly wrestling shows. In 1992 Peña started a booking agency, providing wrestlers and matches for the Televisa owned Asistencia Asesoría y <b>Administración</b> (AAA) promotion. While Peña technically owned the promotion Televisa owns {{the rights to the}} AAA name. In a move that mirrored Flores' departure in the 1970s Peña left the promotion alongside a number of young wrestlers who were unhappy with their position in the promotion. With the creation of AAA the promotion replaced the UWA as Mexico's other main wrestling promotion, creating a long running rivalry between CMLL and AAA. Starting in 1996 CMLL began promoting an annual show in March, first paying homage to Salvador Lutteroth, then later Lutteroth and El Santo and then finally becoming the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas ("Homage to Two Legends") annual show series.|$|E
