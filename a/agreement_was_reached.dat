5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the A refusing to cooperate, a tentative <b>agreement</b> <b>was</b> <b>reached</b> with the London and North Western Railway, with whom Watkin was on good terms, for the MR to build a route via Chesham to connect to LNWR mainline. This scheme would provide the LNWR with an alternative route into London when necessary, while providing Watkin with his long-sought connection to the north. The land required for an intermediate station near Chalfont St Giles and a line between there and a site outside Chesham was purchased. <b>Agreement</b> <b>was</b> <b>reached</b> with the LNWR {{that the costs of}} building the line would be shared equally by the MR and LNWR in return for the LNWR having running rights to Rickmansworth, and an Act of Parliament authorising the extension was obtained in 1885.|$|E
5|$|On 21 June 1958, the Parliamentary Assembly {{recommended}} to the Council that the Assembly should have its {{seat in the}} same place where the other organisations are based, although it accepted that plenary sessions could be held elsewhere.

5|$|The Peronist Carlos Menem {{was elected}} {{president}} in May 1989.

5|$|The {{territorial}} {{agreement between}} the triumvirate and Sextus Pompeius began to crumble once Octavian divorced Scribonia and married Livia on 17 January 38BC. One of Pompeius' naval commanders betrayed him and handed over Corsica and Sardinia to Octavian. Octavian lacked the resources to confront Pompeius alone, however, so an <b>agreement</b> <b>was</b> <b>reached</b> with the Second Triumvirate's extension for another five-year period beginning in 37BC.|$|E
5|$|After {{extensive}} {{negotiations to}} implement a collateral structure open to all eurozone countries, on 4 October 2011, a modified escrow collateral <b>agreement</b> <b>was</b> <b>reached.</b> The expectation is that only Finland will utilise it, due, in part, to a requirement to contribute initial capital to European Stability Mechanism in one instalment instead of five instalments over time.

In 1998, a compromise <b>agreement</b> <b>was</b> <b>reached</b> to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation.

5|$|Following Kasa-Vubu's reinstatement, {{there was}} an {{attempted}} rapprochement between the Congolese factions.

Although a compromise <b>agreement</b> <b>was</b> <b>reached,</b> it was prevented from taking effect as negotiations broke down amid personal animosity between Kasa-Vubu and Tshombe. An attempted reconciliation in July 1961 led to the formation of a new government, led by Cyrille Adoula, which brought together deputies from both Lumumbist and South Kasai factions but also failed to bring a reconciliation with Katanga.|$|E

A plea <b>agreement</b> <b>was</b> <b>reached</b> with one convicted victim. Illinois State's Attorney Devine made a broader offer to several inmates. Aaron Patterson rejected the plea deal.|$|E

That provided some breathing space as it was not before late September 1984 that an <b>agreement</b> <b>was</b> <b>reached</b> between the IMF and Argentina.|$|E

Smallpeice served as {{managing director of the}} joint venture, in addition to his role as managing director of BOAC itself.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} model that predicts that, through its effect on {{aggregate}} demand and country risk premia, sovereign debt restructuring can adversely affect the private sector's access to foreign capital markets. Using fixed effect analysis of the micro [...] level data, we estimate that sovereign debt rescheduling episodes are indeed systematically accompanied by a decline in foreign credit to emerging market non-financial private firms, both during debt renegotiations and {{for over two years}} after the <b>agreements</b> <b>are</b> <b>reached.</b> This decline <b>is</b> large (over 20 %), statistically significant and robust when we control for a host of fundamentals. Credit to the exporting sector is not affected during the debt renegotiations but declines after the <b>agreement</b> <b>is</b> <b>reached,</b> while credit to non [...] exporting sector declines during the renegotiations and then recovers within a year after the <b>agreement</b> <b>is</b> <b>reached.</b> We also find that voluntary debt swaps and buy [...] backs, agreements with commercial creditors, and agreements that include new lending do not have such detrimental effects...|$|R
