5|$|First {{settled by}} Europeans in the 1790s, Scarborough {{has grown from}} a {{collection}} of small rural villages <b>and</b> <b>farms</b> to become fully urbanised with a diverse cultural community. Incorporated in 1850 as a township, Scarborough became part of Metropolitan Toronto in 1953 and was reconstituted as a borough in 1967. Scarborough rapidly developed as a suburb of Old Toronto over the next decade and became a city in 1983. In 1998, Scarborough and the rest of Metropolitan Toronto were amalgamated into the present city of Toronto. Scarborough is an administrative district in Toronto and has its own community council.

5|$|For {{many years}} Cheadle Hulme was rural countryside, {{made up of}} woods, open land, <b>and</b> <b>farms.</b> The local {{population}} {{was made up of}} farmers and peasants, living in small cottages and working the land under the tenancy of the Lord of the Manor. Most families kept animals for food, grew their own crops, and probably bought and sold produce at Stockport market. Water was obtained from local wells and ponds, and sometimes the Micker Brook.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 17th century a rising cost of {{consumable}} goods and a series of bad harvests brought about economic changes in Glamorgan. Those with enough wealth were able to seize on opportunities created by these unsettled conditions and set about enlarging and enclosing farm lands. The enclosure of freehold lands that began in the later Middle Ages now gained momentum <b>and</b> <b>farms</b> that were once owned by individual farmers were now owned by small groups of wealthy landowners. By the 19th century most of the Rhondda farms and estates were owned by absentee landlords, such as the Marquis of Bute, Earl of Dunraven, Crawshay Bailey of Merthyr and the De Winton family of Brecon.|$|E

5|$|Like all creeks in Lycoming County, Larrys Creek {{served as}} an area for {{settlers}} to establish homesteads <b>and</b> <b>farms.</b> As logging became a major industry in the mid-19th century, the creek {{was a source of}} power for sawmills and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek, in what is now Mifflin Township, was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at Williamsport (as they were on Pine Creek to the west).|$|E

5|$|Malvern's rapid {{urbanisation}} {{during the}} latter half of the 19th century spread eastwards and northwards from Great Malvern, the traditional town centre on the steep flank of the Worcestershire Beacon, and engulfed the manors <b>and</b> <b>farms</b> in the immediate area. It was often the farms, such as Pickersleigh (now known as Pickersleigh Court and previously known as Pickersleigh House), near Great Malvern, and the Howsells in Malvern Link which merged with Great Malvern in 1900 that gave their names to many of the new neighbourhoods. The urban agglomeration continued to spread, and by the middle of the 20th century had reached the suburban parishes of West Malvern, Malvern Wells, Newland, Madresfield, and Guarlford.|$|E
5|$|The 1834 revolt and the {{immediate}} aftermath reduced the male population of Palestine by about one-fifth. This decrease is attributed to {{the large numbers of}} peasants who were either deported to Egypt to work in manufacturing, drafted into Egypt's military, or abandoned their villages <b>and</b> <b>farms</b> to join the Bedouin nomadic populations. Around 10,000 peasants were deported to Egypt and the general population was disarmed. The conscription orders were extended beyond the Muslim population to the local Christians. Taxes were also extended from landed property to include livestock as well. As Ibrahim consolidated his hold over Palestine and disarmed the population, banditry by local tribesmen and civil strife was largely eliminated.|$|E
5|$|The Philippine {{government}} {{estimated that}} approximately 2million people in 19 provinces {{were affected by}} Xangsane, which destroyed many homes <b>and</b> <b>farms</b> on its path through the islands. The local and regional Philippine National Red Cross chapters reported major damage in at least 116 municipalities, 12 cities, {{and a total of}} 1,295 barangays across the country. Torrential rains from Milenyo also caused flooding and landslides in Laguna, Cavite, and Quezon. Xangsane caused the destruction of the Calumpang Dam in the Municipality of Liliw, which channeled water to irrigation canals around the area. In all, Milenyo was responsible for 197 deaths and 5.9billion Philippine pesos ($118million, 2006USD) in damage, mostly to personal property and agriculture.|$|E

In addition to Tichborne Park's , the estates included manors, lands <b>and</b> <b>farms</b> in Hampshire, and considerable properties in London and elsewhere, which altogether produced an annual income of over £20,000, equivalent to several millions in 21st-century terms.|$|E

In retaliation for the role of locals who supported the siege, numerous homes <b>and</b> <b>farms</b> were destroyed, and Patriot sympathizers were driven out of the area.
