6000|$|Her father read it carefully. [...] "Yes, {{that is all}} right," [...] he said, and {{returned}} it to her. He added, after an absent pause: [...] "I have brought your things, Marcia. Your mother packed <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O, {{how is it}} {{that man}} has so fascinated me?' was <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think.</b> Her own self, as she had sat spell-bound before him, was all she could see. Her gait was constrained, from the {{knowledge}} that his eyes were upon her until she had passed the hollow by the waterfall, and by ascending the rise had become hidden from his view by the boughs of the overhanging trees.|$|E
60|$|And, oh, {{how good}} we were! How angelically and unnaturally good! Never was {{there such a}} band of kind, sweet-tempered, unselfish {{children}} in any orchard. Even Felicity and Dan, for once in their lives, got through the day without any exchange of left-handed compliments. Cecily confided {{to me that she}} never meant to put her hair up in curlers on Saturday nights again, because it was pretending. She was so anxious to repent of something, sweet girl, and this was <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of.|$|E
60|$|On {{the trip}} back to Oakdale, Abigail Prim cuddled {{in the back seat}} beside her father, told him <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> to tell of Bridge and his {{goodness}} to her.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> had {{finished}} <b>all</b> the preparations <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of. <b>She</b> sat and waited. She {{listened for the}} door-bell, the telephone. Her eagerness was stilled. Her hands drooped.|$|R
60|$|After {{many more}} {{representations}} and entreaties, Nicholas obtained a promise from Mrs Nickleby that <b>she</b> would try <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> to <b>think</b> as he did; {{and that if}} Mr Frank persevered in his attentions she would endeavour to discourage them, or, at the least, would render him no countenance or assistance. He determined to forbear mentioning the subject to Kate until he was quite convinced that there existed a real necessity for his doing so; and resolved to assure himself, {{as well as he}} could by close personal observation, of the exact position of affairs. This was a very wise resolution, but he was prevented from putting it in practice by a new source of anxiety and uneasiness.|$|R
60|$|Reaction had set in. She {{had known}} it would come, and had made ready to fight against it, but she had underestimated the {{strength}} of the enemy. It seemed to her, in those first minutes, that she had done a mad thing; that all those arguments which she had used were far-fetched and ridiculous. It was useless to tell herself that she had thought the whole thing out clearly and had taken the only course that could have been taken. With Bill's departure the power to face the situation steadily had left her. <b>All</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of was that she loved him and that she had sent him away.|$|E
6000|$|Lucy {{felt better}} next day, {{and offered to}} help Creech at the few camp duties. He would not let her. There {{was nothing to do}} but rest and wait, and the idleness {{appeared}} to be harder on Creech than on Lucy. He had always been exceedingly active. Lucy divined that every hour his remorse grew keener, and she did <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of to make it so. Creech made her a rude brush by gathering small roots and binding them tightly and cutting the ends square. And Lucy, after the manner of an Indian, got the tangles out of her hair. That day Creech seemed to want to hear Lucy's voice, and so they often fell into conversation. Once he said, thoughtfully: ...|$|E
6000|$|But the warper {{turned on}} him with baleful eyes. [...] "She likes me," [...] {{he said in a}} grating voice, [...] "and yet I'm as nothing to her; we are all as nothing to her beside you. If there hadna been you I should hae become the father to her I craved to be; but you had mesmerized her; she had eyes for none but you. I sent you to the herding, meaning to break your power over her, and <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> o' was my cruelty in sindering you. Syne you ran aff wi' her to London, {{stealing}} her frae me. I was without her while she was growing frae lassie to woman, the years when maybe she could hae made o' me what she willed. Magerful Tam took the mother frae me, and he lived again in you to tak' the dochter." ...|$|E
60|$|Sir Wilfrid was {{entrenched in}} a corner of the room behind Miranda's piano. During his seizure he made the weirdest, most unearthly noises. He would begin with a series of choking, spasmodic sounds, {{continuing}} into a gruesome gurgle, and ending up with a strangled howl. Nobody could hear a word Mr. Meredith was saying, except now and then, when Sir Wilfrid stopped for breath. Nobody looked at the bride except Susan, who never dragged her fascinated eyes from Miranda's face--all the others were gazing at the dog. Miranda had been trembling with nervousness but as soon as Sir Wilfrid began his performance <b>she</b> forgot it. <b>All</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of was that her dear dog was dying and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not go to him. She never remembered a word of the ceremony.|$|R
5000|$|Right {{after the}} surgery, Taub gets paged. He {{goes to the}} parking lot where a tearful Rachel apologetically takes back what she had said earlier, saying that <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> help but <b>think</b> <b>all</b> day about him being {{intimate}} with another woman and wouldn't be able to stand it. Taub reassures her that nothing happened and that all he needs is her, and goes home with her, relinquishing his [...] "license" [...] to date other women.|$|R
60|$|Brooke made no answer, {{though a}} swift flush {{rose to his}} face, as he remembered his half-coherent speeches at the ranch, and the astonishment in the girl's eyes, for it seemed {{probable}} that the explanation that had occurred to Jimmy had also suggested itself to her. Then he smiled grimly, as he decided {{that it did not}} greatly matter, after <b>all,</b> since <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> more hardly of him than she would do when the truth came out presently.|$|R
60|$|All {{hopes of}} the young man's reformation being now ended, Mr. and Mrs. Butler thought it could serve no purpose to explain to Lady Staunton a history so full of horror. She {{remained}} their guest more than a year, during {{the greater part of}} which period her grief was excessive. In the latter months, it assumed the appearance of listlessness and low spirits, which the monotony of her sister's quiet establishment afforded no means of dissipating. Effie, from her earliest youth, was never formed for a quiet low content. Far different from her sister, she required the dissipation of society to divert her sorrow, or enhance her joy. She left the seclusion of Knocktarlitie with tears of sincere affection, and after heaping its inmates with <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of that might be valuable in their eyes. But she did leave it; and, when the anguish of the parting was over, her departure was a relief to both sisters.|$|E
6000|$|She {{got out of}} her tram at the Pillar and ferreted her way quickly {{among the}} crowds. She went into Downes's cake-shop but the shop {{was so full of}} people that {{it was a long time}} before she could get herself {{attended}} to. She bought a dozen of mixed penny cakes, and at last came out of the shop laden with a big bag. Then she thought what else would she buy: she wanted to buy something really nice. They would be sure to have plenty of apples and nuts. It was hard to know what to buy and <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of was cake. She decided to buy some plumcake but Downes's plumcake had not enough almond icing on top of it so she went over to a shop in Henry Street. Here she was a long time in suiting herself and the stylish young lady behind the counter, who was evidently a little annoyed by her, asked her was it wedding-cake she wanted to buy. That made Maria blush and smile at the young lady; but the young lady took it all very seriously and finally cut a thick slice of plumcake, parcelled it up and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my back!" [...] was <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> or say as {{she felt}} the jar all through her little body, and a {{corresponding}} fear in her guilty little mind that someone would come and find out the double mischief she had been at. For a moment she lay quite still {{to recover from the}} shock, then as the pain passed she began to wonder how she should get back, and looked about her to see if she could do it alone. She thought she could, as the sofa was near and she had improved so much that she could sit up a little if the doctor would have let her. She was gathering herself together for the effort, when, within arm's reach now, she saw the tempting paper, and seized it with glee, for in spite of her predicament she did want to tease Frank. A glance showed that it was not the composition nor a note, but the beginning of a letter from Mrs. Minot to her sister, and Jill was about to lay it down when her own name caught her eye, and she could not resist reading it. Hard words to write of one so young, doubly hard to read, and impossible to forget.|$|E
6000|$|Was she to {{be blamed}} for {{thinking}} so meanly of Tommy? You can blame her with that tear in her eye if you choose; but I can think only of the gladness that came afterwards when {{she knew she had}} been unjust to him. [...] "Thank you, thank you, thank you!" [...] the bird sang to its Creator when the sun came out after rain, and it was Grizel's song as she listened to Corp's story of heroic Tommy. There was no room in her exultant heart for remorse. It would have shown littleness to be able to think of herself at <b>all</b> when <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> so gloriously of him. She was more than beautiful now; she was radiant; and it was because Tommy was the man she wanted him to be. As those who are cold hold out their hands to the fire did she warm her heart at what Corp had to tell, and the great joy that was lit within her made her radiant. Now the baby was in her lap, smiling back to her. He thought he had done it all. [...] "So you thought you could resist me!" [...] the baby crowed.|$|R
60|$|It {{could not}} be Mr. Fotheringham, the only poet <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only beg to be told.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> {{of nothing}} to say, {{and for a}} while they {{remained}} in silence. Then he got up.|$|R
60|$|Nobody noticed Rilla's flushed {{face and}} {{trembling}} hands. Even the most thoughtful and watchful of {{parents do not}} see everything that goes on under their very noses. Rilla made a third attempt to give the long-suffering Jims his dinner, but <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of was the question--Would Ken come to see her before he went away? She had not heard from {{him for a long}} while. Had he forgotten her completely? If he did not come she would know that he had. Perhaps there was even--some other girl back there in Toronto. Of course there was. She was a little fool to be thinking about him at all. She would not think about him. If he came, well and good. It would only be courteous of him to make a farewell call at Ingleside where he had often been a guest. If he did not come--well and good, too. It did not matter very much. Nobody was going to fret. That was all settled comfortably--she was quite indifferent--but meanwhile Jims was being fed with a haste and recklessness that would have filled the soul of Morgan with horror. Jims himself didn't like it, being a methodical baby, accustomed to swallowing spoonfuls with a decent interval for breath between each. He protested, but his protests availed him nothing. Rilla, as far as the care and feeding of infants was concerned, was utterly demoralized.|$|E
60|$|She did not answer. Surprisingly, to-day, {{she did not}} care. <b>All</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of, all {{she wanted}} was {{to go on and}} on beside him with the world shut out--on and on forever. She was his--what did it matter? They {{were on their way to}} Boston! She began, dreamily, to think about Boston, to try to restore it in her {{imagination}} to the exalted place it had held before she met Ditmar; to reconstruct it from vague memories of childhood when, in two of the family peregrinations, she had crossed it. Traces remained of emotionally-toned impressions acquired when she had walked about the city holding Edward's hand--of a long row of stately houses with forbidding fronts, set on a hillside, of a wide, tree-covered space where children were playing. And her childish verdict, persisting to-day, was one of inaccessibility, impenetrability, of jealously guarded wealth and beauty. Those houses, and the treasures she was convinced they must contain, were not for her! Some of the panes of glass in their windows were purple--she remembered a little thing like that, and asking her father the reason! He hadn't known. This purple quality had somehow steeped itself into her memory of Boston, and even now the colour stood for the word, impenetrable. That was extraordinary. Even now! Well, they were going to Boston; if Ditmar had said they were going to Bagdad it would have been quite as credible--and incredible. Wherever they were going, it was into the larger, larger life, and walls were to crumble before them, walls through which they would pass, even as they rent the white veil of the storm, into regions of beauty....|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, it's no use even {{to discuss}} that, for it's {{perfectly}} absurd {{to suppose that}} it could ever come to that. But the case," [...] added Mrs. Elmore, perceiving that further delay was only further suffering for her husband, and that any fact would now probably fall far short of his apprehensions, [...] "is simply this, and I don't know that it amounts to anything; but at Peschiera, just before the train started, she looked out of the window, and saw a splendid officer {{walking up and down}} and smoking; and before she could draw back he must have seen her, for he threw away his cigar instantly, and got into the same compartment. He talked awhile in German with an old gentleman who was there, and then he spoke in Italian with Cazzi; and afterwards, when he heard her speaking English with Cazzi, he joined in. I don't know how he came to join in at first, and she doesn't, either; but it seems that he knew some English, and he began speaking. He was very tall and handsome and distinguished-looking, and a perfect gentleman in his manners; and she says that she saw Cazzi looking rather queer, but he didn't say anything, and so she kept on talking. She told him at once that she was an American, and that she was coming here to stay with friends; and, as he was very curious about America, she told him <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of. It did her good to talk about home, for she had been feeling a little blue at being so far away from everybody. Now, I don't see any harm in it; do you, Owen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Next {{morning the}} day broke clear {{after the long}} storm, and Annie woke in revolt against the sort of {{subjection}} {{in which she had}} parted from Mr. Peck. She felt the need of showing Mrs. Bolton that, although she had been civil to him, she had no sympathy with his ideas; but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> of any way to formulate her opposition, and <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> say in offence was, [...] "Does Mr. Peck usually forget his child when he starts home?" ...|$|R

5000|$|In the Season 4 finale, [...] "Always", Beckett and Castle {{are forced}} {{to deal with their}} {{relationship}} when a murder they are investigating turns out to be linked to Beckett's shooting almost a year before. Castle, trying to get Beckett off the case, tells her he loves her and admits that he heard her saying she remembered everything. She is, however, angry that he hid important facts from her in order to protect her and refuses to back off from the case, causing Castle to end their partnership. Beckett is unable to resolve the case this time, though, and, in a near-death experience, realizes how much Castle means to her. After she resigns from her job, Beckett visits Castle, tells him she is sorry and when she almost dies <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> about was him. After some hesitation on Castle's part, they kiss passionately and Beckett takes his hand and leads him to his bedroom to make love.|$|E
40|$|After {{blowing off}} her friend with {{a text message}} {{to spend the rest}} of the weekend with Pete, Prilly floated into her office Monday feeling exhilarated. Even though she knew Pete was {{probably}} not terribly suc-cessful, <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> about was how sexy he was and how lucky she was to have met him. Filled with thoughts of seeing him that evening, and wear-ing her lucky bronze-colored sling back heels, she barely noticed Janice pop into her doorway before having a chance to turn her computer on. “It’s 9 : 15. You’re always here right at 8 : 00. I was concerned. A little bit longer and I would have called you just to make sure you were ok. ” Considering they had almost no relationship what-soever, she wondered why Janice was feigning thi...|$|E
6000|$|Now Rosina {{generally}} had {{her answer}} ready, and I am very {{sorry to say}} that she did not always speak the truth when <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of anything better. On this occasion she was anxious to think of something better, for fear of getting Jaqueline into a scrape about the chemical experiment in her bedroom. But Rosina was fluttered, as we said, by the royal kindness, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of nothing but to curtsy, and say: ...|$|R
