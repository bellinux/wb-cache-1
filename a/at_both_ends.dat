Initially the Provençals at the southern gate made little headway, but the contingents at the northern wall fared better, with a slow but steady attrition of the defence. On 15 July, a final push was launched <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> of the city, and eventually the inner rampart of the northern wall was captured.

5|$|The zduhaći {{of a band}} {{would leave}} their bodies in sleep and gather at an {{appointed}} place, before flying into a battle. They used various weapons, such as spindles, beech buds, sharp splinters, leaves, stalks of straw, fluff, flakes, sand, long twigs, cornel stones, pine cones, eggshells, and other light objects. As believed in Herzegovina, zduhaći uprooted gigantic firs and oaks and fought with them. However, the most powerful zduhać weapon was held to be a stick of luč (resinous wood burned to give light or used as kindling) charred <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends,</b> or any charred splinter of wood.

40|$|Abstract：Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) is {{a primary}} air pollutant {{as an indicator of}} air quality released from motor vehicle combustion. A comparative study of the distributions of CO concentration with no heat source in two tunnel models open and closed <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>end</b> sides is simulated with a commercial CFD code. The tunnel models are used to investigate the CO concentration distributions at three Reynolds numbers, which are computed by the inlet velocities of 0. 3, 0. 6 and 1. 0 m/s. For a better tunnel design, the CFD predictive approaches are available in qualitatively studying the distributions of CO concentration. In the case of the tunnel open <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>end</b> sides in sixty seconds, the total CO concentrations are approximately twenty eight percent higher than those in the closed case...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} to approximate the variable radius offset curves by cubic B'ezier curves. The offset curve is approximated by a cubic B'ezier curve which interpolates the positions and derivatives {{of the exact}} offset curve <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>end</b> points. Thus, it approximates the exact offset curve very closely near the curve end points, but not necessarily {{in the middle of}} the curve. Given a fixed base curve, by changing the offset radius and its derivative at an end point, one can easily control the offset curve shape near the end point. To better control the offset curve shape {{in the middle of the}} curve, we use two global shape parameters (bias and tension) of the offset curve (see [16]). A variety of variable radius offset curves are easily generated by using six shape control parameters (the two offsets and their derivatives <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>end</b> points, and the bias and tension parameters). Each bristle of a B'ezier brush stroke is represented by a variable radius offset curve. Even with simpl [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Assessment of low {{attenuation}} {{areas and}} lung densitometry on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) {{have been reported}} in studies of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Objective : The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine if HRCT could separate asthmatic patients from normal control subjects and patients with emphysema. Methods : Subjects were divided into three groups : 24 patients with bronchial asthma, 23 patients with pulmonary emphysema and 15 normal controls. HRCT scans of the lung were performed at three different levels <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>end</b> inspiration and expiration in all patients and control subjects. Results : The mean CT number of three slices was significantly lower in asthmatic subjects compared with normal individuals <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>end</b> inspiration (p < 0. 05) and expiration (p < 0. 01). The relative area of the lung with an attenuation value lower than - 950 HU (% LAA) for three slices was significantly higher in asthmatic subjects than in normal individuals at end inspiration (p < 0. 05), but there was no significant difference at end expiration. The mean CT number and % LAA obtained from studies that were performed at three cm above the top of the diaphragm provided the best separation among three anatomic levels. In comparison between asthmatic and emphysema patients, both parameters were significantly different in asthmatic subjects than in those with emphysema <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>end</b> inspiration and expiration on each scan and in the total scans (p < 0. 001). Conclusions : HRCT is a useful method to separate asthmatic subjects from patients with emphysema and normal subjects. 【目的】肺野low attenuation area（LAA）は、慢性閉塞性肺疾患（COPD）における肺気腫の存在ならびに程度を反映することが知られている。そこで喘息患者におけるLAAの意義を明らかにすることを目的として、COPD患者、コントロールとの比較検討を行った。　 【対象と方法】喘息症例 24 例、COPD症例 23 例、コントロール 15 例を対象として、上・中・下肺野の 3 スライスで深吸気、深呼気時において胸部高分解能CT（HRCT）を施行し 3 群間で比較検討を行った。CTパラメーターとしては、平均m値、肺野面積に対する－ 950 HU以下のLAAの割合（% LAA）を採用した。　 【結果】 1 ． 3 スライスの平均CT値は、吸気および呼気とも 3 群間での有意の差が認められた。 2 ． 3 スライスの% LAAは、吸気では 3 群間での有意の差が認められたが、呼気では喘息とコントロール間での有意の差は認められなかった。 3 ．COPD症例では、吸気、呼気ともに平均CT値は他の 2 群より有意に低値を示し、% LAAは他の 2 群よりより有意に高値を示した。 4 ． 3 群間の平均CT値と% LAAの相違は下肺野のスライスで最も顕著であった。　 【考案】平均CT値および% LAAは、喘息、COPD、コントロールにおいて有意に異なっており、喘息およぴCOPDの病態を反映する可能性が示唆された...|$|R
