50|$|After the 1990 season, {{the focus}} of the Foundation shifted to {{performing}} detailed flight test analyses of experimental aircraft, again focusing on the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Each <b>aircraft</b> evaluated resulted in an Aircraft Performance Report that was then published by the EAA. These activities took place at a new facility, the CAFE Flight Test Center, at the Sonoma County Airport, funded by the EAA and completed in 1993.|$|R
50|$|A {{subfield}} {{of fluid}} dynamics, aerodynamics studies {{the physics of}} a body moving through the air. As lift and drag are a function of air speed, their relationships are major determinants of an <b>aircraft</b> design <b>efficiency.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Aircraft</b> <b>efficiency</b> {{increases}} with height. Burning fuel decreases {{the weight of}} an aircraft which may then choose to increase its flight level to further improve fuel consumption. For example, an aircraft {{may be able to}} reach FL290 early in a flight, but step climb to FL370 later in the route after weight has decreased due to fuel burn off.|$|E
50|$|As {{the weight}} generates {{indirectly}} lift-induced drag, its minimisation {{leads to a}} better <b>aircraft</b> <b>efficiency.</b> For a given payload, a lighter airframe generates a lower drag, and minimising weight can be done through its configuration, materials science and construction methods. To obtain a longer range, a larger fuel fraction of the maximum takeoff weight is needed, adversely affecting efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Aerodynamic drag {{comes from}} {{parasitic}} drag and lift-generated induced drag. Maximizing lift-to-drag ratio augments the <b>aircraft</b> <b>efficiency,</b> {{and this is}} attained by minimising either. As parasitic drag increase with speed but induced drag decrease simultaneously, there is an optimum speed where the sum of both is minimal, the best glide ratio. For powered aircraft, the optimum has to be balanced with thrust efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Highlights of the {{aeronautics}} program include {{research on}} <b>aircraft</b> energy <b>efficiency,</b> supersonic cruise <b>aircraft,</b> vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, short haul/short takeoff and landing aircraft, and general aviation aircraft.

40|$|Tensile and {{shear moduli}} of four ACEE (<b>Aircraft</b> Energy <b>Efficiency</b> Program) resins are {{presented}} along with ACEE composite material modulus predictions based on micromechanics. Compressive strength and fracture toughness of the resins and composites were discussed. In addition, several resin synthesis techniques are reviewed...|$|R
50|$|Rutan's stated {{goals for}} the design {{included}} reduced susceptibility to departure/spin and efficient long range cruise; these goals were achieved. The use of a canard configuration allowed a stall-resistant design, {{at the price of}} somewhat increased takeoff and landing speeds and distances relative to a similar conventional design with effective flaps. The holder of the CAFE Challenge <b>aircraft</b> <b>efficiency</b> prize briefly was Gary Hertzler, set using a VariEze.|$|E
50|$|Jet <b>aircraft</b> <b>{{efficiency}}</b> is improving: between 1960 and 2000 {{there was}} a 55% overall fuel efficiency gain (as compared to the Boeing 707). Most of the improvements in efficiency were gained {{in the first decade}} when jet craft first came into widespread commercial use. Between 1971 and 1998 the fleet-average annual improvement per available seat-kilometre was estimated at 2.4%. Nonetheless, from the 1960s to the present total fleet emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide have outpaced efficiency gains, due to growth in the air travel market.|$|E
50|$|Although {{variable}} geometry is a universally recognized {{approach to}} improve <b>aircraft</b> <b>efficiency</b> and performance over {{a range of}} Mach numbers, {{there is no one}} method to achieve variable geometry. The F-15 Eagle employs wedge inlets with adjustable flaps to control the flow. For subsonic flow, the flaps are completely closed and for supersonic flow, the flaps are open. The Concorde employed an external-compression inlet, using a series of oblique shocks followed by a normal shock to slow the flow sufficiently for the turbojet engine. Perhaps the most recognizable supersonic aircraft, the SR-71, used a hydraulically actuated cone to reduce the speed of the supersonic flow through the aircraft inlet.|$|E
40|$|Factors {{affecting}} the cost-effectiveness and {{economics of the}} air transportation industry are reviewed. The delivery of more fuel-efficient aircraft and eventual total replacement in the 1990 's by fleets of advanced aircraft are seen to offset rising fuel costs. Better airport operations are perceived to eliminate fuel-costly delays due to overcrowded runways, lack of available carriers, and maintenance of aircraft in holding patterns. Noise reduction research will lower the lawsuit costs from noise pollution, {{and the introduction of}} advanced turbofans for long, short, and medium range flights, advanced commuter planes, and advanced SSTs offering projected 50 % increases in current <b>aircraft</b> <b>efficiencies</b> are seen to be limited only by the airlines' ability to provide purchase financing, rather than by a lack of available new technology...|$|R

50|$|The CAFE Foundation is an {{outgrowth}} from activities {{sponsored by the}} Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) Chapter 124. In the late 1970s, races were held at the annual EAA AirVenture Airshow in Oshkosh, Wisconsin in which {{the goal was to}} fly the most fuel-efficient general aviation aircraft. From the early races, as the Lowers-Backer-Falk competition (or Oshkosh 500 races), the CAFE Formula evolved to better evaluate the <b>aircraft</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The start Formula was V x MPG x W, later V^1.25 x MPG x W^0.75, where V=average velocity {{over the course of the}} race, MPG=miles per gallon of fuel and W=cabin payload in pounds. The first regular race to use this formula was the CAFE 250 then CAFE 400, which was held each summer from 1981 to 1990 and carried a purse of $2,000.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{competition}} among airline manufacturers and operators has highlighted {{the issue of}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Fewer aircraft orders have led to an all-out efficiency improvement effort among the manufacturers to maintain if not increase {{their share of the}} shrinking number of aircraft sales. <b>Aircraft</b> <b>efficiency</b> is important in airline profitability and is key if fuel prices increase from their current low. In a continuing effort to improve <b>aircraft</b> <b>efficiency</b> and develop an optimal performance technology base, NASA Dryden Flight Research Center developed and flight tested an adaptive performance seeking control system to optimize the quasi-steady-state performance of the F- 15 aircraft. The demonstrated technology is equally applicable to transport aircraft although with less improvement. NASA Dryden, in transitioning this technology to transport aircraft, is specifically exploring the feasibility of applying adaptive optimal control techniques to performance optimization of redundant control effectors. A simulation evaluation of a preliminary control law optimizes wing-aileron camber for minimum net aircraft drag. Two submodes are evaluated: one to minimize fuel and the other to maximize velocity. This paper covers the status of performance optimization of the current fleet of subsonic transports. Available integrated controls technologies are reviewed to define approaches using active controls. A candidate control law for adaptive performance optimization is presented along with examples of algorithm operation...|$|E
