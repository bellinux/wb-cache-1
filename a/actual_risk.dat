As of 2016, there is no epidemiological evidence for an increased relative risk of pulmonary barotrauma, decompression sickness or death among divers with asthma.

25|$|Optimism bias is {{typically}} measured through two determinants of risk: absolute risk, where individuals {{are asked to}} estimate their likelihood of experiencing a negative event compared to their actual chance of experiencing a negative event (comparison against self), and comparative risk, where individuals are asked to estimate the likelihood of experiencing a negative event (their personal risk estimate) compared to others {{of the same age}} and sex (a target risk estimate). Problems can occur when trying to measure absolute risk because it is extremely difficult to determine the <b>actual</b> <b>risk</b> statistic for a person. Therefore, the optimistic bias is primarily measured in comparative risk forms, where people compare themselves against others, through direct and indirect comparisons. Direct comparisons ask whether an individual's own risk of experiencing an event is less than, greater than, or equal to someone else's risk, while indirect comparisons ask individuals to provide separate estimates of their own risk of experiencing an event and other's risk of experiencing the same event.|$|E

Some also advise not to hug or hold children when the radiation is still high, and a one- or two- metre distance to others may be recommended.|$|E

2500|$|Savita Halappanavar, {{pregnant}} at 17 weeks {{with her first}} baby, {{went to the hospital}} with her husband Praveen on 21 October 2012 complaining about back pain. She was examined and discharged, and then returned to the hospital a few hours later after she felt something [...] "coming down." [...] An examination showed that the gestational sac had protruded into her vagina, almost to the opening. She was admitted to the hospital for observation, as a miscarriage appeared to be inevitable. [...] Her water broke just after midnight on 22 October. On the 23 the Halappanavars discussed terminating the pregnancy early with one of the consultant doctors: according to the 2013 Health Service report: [...] "O Consultant 1 stated that the patient and her husband were advised of Irish law in relation to this. At interview the consultant stated 'Under Irish law, if there’s no evidence of risk {{to the life of the}} mother, our hands are tied so long as there’s a fetal heart'. The consultant stated that if risk to the mother was to increase a termination would have been possible, but that it would be based on <b>actual</b> <b>risk</b> and not a theoretical risk of infection 'we can’t predict who is going to get an infection'". [...] Midwife manager Ann Maria Burke attempted to calm the couple and explained that the termination cannot be carried out because Ireland is [...] "a Catholic country". [...] Halappanavar began to develop signs of sepsis, and the hospital decided to insert a central line to better manage her condition, and had also decided to administer misoprostol to induce delivery; the medication was not given because on 24 October she delivered a stillborn girl in the procedure room where the central line was being inserted.

40|$|Prior {{research}} indicates that individual perceptions {{of the risk of}} punishment for criminal behavior are unrelated to <b>actual</b> <b>risks</b> of punishment in the areas in which individuals reside. It could be argued, however, that the relevant policy question is whether variation in actual punishment levels affects average perceptions of risk among aggregates. Scholars have argued that there is “collective wisdom ” in the perceptions of collectivities of humans, even if the views of individuals are inaccurate. This thesis is tested using survey data on individual perceptions of the risks of legal punishment for crimes, aggregated up to the level of county populations. The authors find that the aggregate perceptions of county populations are generally not related to actual county levels of the certainty, severity, and swiftness of punishment. Thus, neither the perceptions of individuals nor the average perceptions of populations have any significant association with <b>actual</b> <b>risks</b> of punishment...|$|R
