D'Sora explains that she just split up with her boyfriend and Data attempts to comfort her. Later they play together in a chamber concert along with Keiko O'Brien (Rosalind Chao). D'Sora complains of her abilities as a musician, but Data insists {{that he could not}} hear <b>anything</b> <b>wrong.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in {{his final}} year of life was an ascetic, looked ugly and a sickly {{skeletal}} figure, already caricatured in the Western media. Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi {{said that if he}} would not let Manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness. Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did <b>anything</b> <b>wrong,</b> but because Bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments. Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.|$|E
5|$|Protected against double jeopardy, Bryant and Milam {{struck a}} deal with Look {{magazine}} in 1956 to tell their story to journalist William Bradford Huie for between $3,600 and $4,000. The interview took place in the law firm of the attorneys who had defended Bryant and Milam. Huie did not ask the questions; Bryant and Milam's own attorneys did. Neither attorney had heard their clients' accounts of the murder before. According to Huie, the older Milam was more articulate and sure of himself than the younger Bryant. Milam admitted to shooting Till and neither of them believed they were guilty or that they had done <b>anything</b> <b>wrong.</b>|$|E

5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} {{not done}} <b>anything</b> <b>wrong,</b> Bart decides to run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While {{wandering}} the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret the bad things they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up onto the roof of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, the Coast Guard cutter Chase took over, escorting the KD II to San Diego. Along {{the way the}} {{investigation}} continued. The Coast Guard reported that the four-man crew was cooperative with {{the investigation}}, largely sitting back and watching television in the lounge. Since they claimed not to have finned the sharks themselves, they believed they had not done <b>anything</b> <b>wrong.</b> Ship's records revealed that the KD II had met fishing vessels, primarily Korean longline fishing boats, at prearranged locations {{on the high seas}} near the Fiji and Solomon Islands and bought fins from them for a total of $250,000. On an earlier voyage that summer, the ship had made $6 million from shark fins obtained the same way. Korean-language records from a broker on board indicated an ongoing operation, giving the names of other ships involved. The refrigeration unit on board had broken before the ship had left Honolulu, and the fins were out on deck in an attempt to dry them out and reduce the odor.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio {{argued that}} dissonance {{was caused by}} {{aversive}} consequences, rather than inconsistency. According to this interpretation, the belief that lying is wrong and hurtful, not the inconsistency between cognitions, is what makes people feel bad. Subsequent research, however, found that people experience dissonance even when {{they feel they have}} not done <b>anything</b> <b>wrong.</b> For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that people experience dissonance even when the consequences of their statements are beneficial—as when they convince sexually active students to use condoms, when they, themselves are not using condoms.|$|E
25|$|Justice White's dissent {{argued that}} the act should have been upheld.

Even if the power were executive, White did not see <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> with delegating that power to an agent as long as Congress could influence him only by a means that is subject to the Presentment and Bicameralism Clause requirements, which the act satisfied, since the Comptroller General could be influenced by Congress only through a joint resolution.|$|E
25|$|On 22 April 2010, {{following}} revellations by {{an internal}} whistle blower and {{investigation by the}} NRL, Storm officials revealed that the club had committed serious and systematic breaches of the salary cap regulations between 2006 and 2010 by running a well-organized dual contract and bookkeeping system that concealed a total of $3.78million in payments made to players outside of the salary cap from the NRL. This included: $303,000 in 2006, $459,000 in 2007, $957,000 in 2008, $1.021million in 2009 and $1.04million in 2010. As a result, the club was stripped of the 2007 and 2009 premierships, 2006–2008 minor premierships and the following year, the 2010 World Club Challenge trophy. They were also fined a then Australian sporting record of $1.689million ($1.1million in NRL prize money which was equally distributed between the remaining 15 clubs, $89,000 in prize money from the World Club Challenge which was distributed to the Leeds Rhinos, and a maximum of $500,000 for breaching the salary cap regulations). In addition they were ordered to cut their payroll by $1.0125million, deducted all eight premiership points received during the 2010 season and barred from receiving premiership points {{for the remainder of}} the 2010 season. The points penalty meant that the club won the 2010 wooden spoon. The former directors attempted unsuccessful legal action against the penalties which collapsed, and the club also had to pay the NRLs legal costs. The matter was also referred to ASIC, the Australian Tax Office, the Victorian State Revenue Office, and the Victoria Police to investigate possible fraud however by May 2011 these investigations were closed. The players themselves were found to have not done <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> during this time so individual awards are recognised in addition, the players were still eligible for Test/State of Origin selection.|$|E
