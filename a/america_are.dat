5|$|Ants {{attack and}} defend {{themselves}} by biting and, in many species, by stinging, often injecting or spraying chemicals, such as formic acid {{in the case}} of formicine ants, alkaloids and piperidines in fire ants, and a variety of protein components in other ants. Bullet ants (Paraponera), located in Central and South <b>America,</b> <b>are</b> considered to have the most painful sting of any insect, although it is usually not fatal to humans. This sting is given the highest rating on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index.|$|E
5|$|Based on ancestral {{reconstruction}} studies, {{the earliest}} (basal) {{members of the}} Sclerodermatineae originated in the late Cretaceous (145–66Ma). The major genera diversified near the mid Cenozoic (66–0Ma). Asia and North <b>America</b> <b>are</b> the most probable ancestral areas for all Sclerodermatineae, and Pinaceae and angiosperms (primarily rosids) are the most probable ancestral hosts.|$|E
5|$|Extinct North American cats {{resembling}} the cheetah had historically {{been assigned to}} Felis, Puma or Acinonyx. However, a phylogenetic analysis in 1990 placed these species under the genus Miracinonyx. Miracinonyx exhibited {{a high degree of}} similarity with the cheetah. However, in 1998, a DNA analysis showed that Miracinonyx inexpectatus, M.studeri, and M.trumani (early to late Pleistocene epoch), found in North <b>America,</b> <b>are</b> not true cheetahs; in fact, they are close relatives of the cougar.|$|E

5|$|The {{trucking}} industry {{serves the}} American economy by transporting {{large quantities of}} raw materials, works in process, and finished goods over land—typically from manufacturing plants to retail distribution centers. Trucks are also used in the construction industry, as dump trucks and portable concrete mixers move the large amounts of rocks, dirt, concrete, and other building materials used in construction.

5|$|At present, {{the continents}} of North and South <b>America</b> <b>are</b> moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have {{produced}} several scenarios {{about how this}} will continue in the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.|$|E

It is organized by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body.

5|$|More recently, {{birds have}} {{appeared}} in books illustrated by some exceptional artists, producing images that were accurate and beautiful, and that made use of the latest available printing techniques. The wood engraver Thomas Bewick's 1797–1804 A History of British Birds brought affordable illustrations {{to the public for}} the first time, and the book formed in effect the first field guide to birds, while John James Audubon's enormous and impressive images of birds in his 1827–1838 Birds of <b>America</b> <b>are</b> among the most admired by art critics and by collectors: early editions fetch among the highest prices paid for any printed books. The ornithologist John Gould's bird illustrations, in books such as A Century of Birds hitherto unfigured from the Himalaya Mountains (1830–1833) with 80 plates, and his 7-volume The Birds of Australia (1840–1848) with 600 plates, related directly to his research, were both beautiful and scientifically useful.|$|E
5|$|Myxogastria are {{distributed}} worldwide; species were found by early researchers on all continents. However, as {{many parts of}} the world were yet not discovered or explored, the exact distribution is not fully known. Europe and North <b>America</b> <b>are</b> often considered the basic habitat of the Myxogastria species. According to recent research, the majority of species are not widely distributed. The Myxogastria are most commonly found in temperate latitudes, and rarely in the polar regions, the subtropics or tropics. The physical features of the substrate and climatic conditions are the major aspects of the species' presence. Endemism is rare.|$|E

5|$|Ornithologists James Hancock and Jim Kushlan also {{consider}} the two to be a single species, with the differences in plumage, size, skin coloration and degree of bill darkening during breeding season forming the diagnostic characters. They have proposed the populations recontacted in northwestern South America {{after a period of}} separation, and that the color difference is likely due to the presence of an enzyme that allows uptake of pigment in the diet. They have questioned whether white-plumaged birds of South <b>America</b> <b>are</b> in fact part of the ruber rather than the albus taxon, and acknowledge that more investigation is needed to determine this.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} duck have brown-plumaged females {{that can be}} {{confused}} with the female mallard. The female gadwall (A.strepera) has an orange-lined bill, white belly, black and white speculum that is seen as a white square on the wings in flight, and is a smaller bird. More similar to the female mallard in North <b>America</b> <b>are</b> the American black duck (A.rubripes), which is notably darker-hued in both sexes than the mallard, and the mottled duck (A.fulvigula), which is somewhat darker than the female mallard, and with slightly different bare-part colouration and no white edge on the speculum.|$|E
5|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of North <b>America</b> <b>are</b> generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia {{by way of}} the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival. The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada. The characteristics of Canadian indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks. Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.|$|E
