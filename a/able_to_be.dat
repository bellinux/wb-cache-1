5|$|After {{the start}} of the Second World War the family fled Paris; Döblin's manuscripts were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> brought into {{safekeeping}} {{in the basement of the}} Sorbonne. Between {{the start of}} the war in 1939 and the German occupation of France in 1940, Döblin worked for the French ministry of information, writing counter-propaganda texts against Nazi Germany with a group of French Germanists and journalists, as well as artists like Frans Masereel.|$|E
5|$|Canning is {{a process}} during which the enzymes in {{vegetables}} are deactivated and the micro-organisms present killed by heat. The sealed can excludes air from the foodstuff to prevent subsequent deterioration. The lowest necessary heat and the minimum processing time are used {{in order to prevent}} the mechanical breakdown of the product and to preserve the flavor as far as is possible. The can is then <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stored at ambient temperatures for a long period.|$|E

50|$|In {{its early}} days, the school {{emphasized}} academics and Catholic catechism, but the education shifted towards agricultural and industrial skills. Parents that <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>were</b> allowed <b>to</b> visit, and some families would camp around the school. Students <b>were</b> also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> visit {{the town of}} Mission until 1948.|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{patients}} who <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>are</b> encouraged <b>to</b> {{walk to the}} toilet or use a bedside commode {{as opposed to a}} urinal. The prolonged use of a urinal has <b>been</b> shown <b>to</b> lead to constipation or trouble urinating.|$|R
5|$|Coal was {{expected}} to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> delivered to the station by rail, as well as by ship to the Port of Blyth. The station's coal storage area would have stored a minimum 45 days worth of coal supply. All of the station's pulverised fuel ash (PFA) may have been sold to the construction industry, transported to which in dry dust tankers. Unsold PFA and furnace bottom ash would be taken to a landfill site by road.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{new power}} station started in 1930, but the Second World War delayed its full {{completion}} until 1951. The station was opened in stages throughout its construction, as generating units were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> put into production while the other sections were still under construction. The first units were commissioned in January 1933.|$|E
5|$|Curative items can {{be found}} or {{purchased}} in the game through various means, each with {{a limited number of}} uses and <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> activated from a character's inventory or the items sub-menu to restore HP or remove a status ailment in or out of combat from a single target. Like other inventory items, in order to be used during combat these must be placed in a party member's equipment slot prior to battle.|$|E

5|$|During the Siege of Sarajevo, Igman {{became part}} of the buffer zone between the belligerents of the Bosnian {{government}} and the Army of Republika Srpska. The area around the ski jumping hill saw heavy fighting during the civil war and was also used for executions by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). Since, the structures have been littered with bullet holes. With the war, the hills were no longer <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism {{is managed}} with {{replacement}} of the hormone thyroxine. This is usually given daily as an oral supplement, and may take {{a few weeks to}} become effective. Some causes of hypothyroidism, such as Postpartum thyroiditis and Subacute thyroiditis may be transient and pass over time, and other causes such as iodine deficiency may be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rectified with dietary supplementation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to gate receipts, the club derived income from club merchandise {{sold in the}} club shop, and the Portway Suite (the clubhouse at the Portway Stadium). The suite was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rented out for private events such as wedding receptions and birthday parties as well as hosting club events such as quiz nights. A boardroom was also available for conferences and meetings.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of Windows Mobile devices were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> managed and synced from a remote {{computer}} using ActiveSync; a data synchronization technology and protocol developed by Microsoft, originally released in 1996. This allowed servers running Microsoft Exchange Server, or other third party variants, to act as a personal information manager and share information such as email, calendar appointments, contacts or internet favorites.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Emil du Bois-Reymond and Hermann von Helmholtz, {{following}} {{the work of}} their teacher Johannes Peter Müller showed the electrical inpulses which pass along nerves; but unlike Müller's views, that such impulses were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> observed. Richard Caton in 1875 demonstrated electrical in the cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys. In the 1820s, Jean Pierre Flourens pioneered the experimental method of damaging specific parts of animal brains describing the effects on movement and behavior.|$|E
5|$|In {{two-dimensional}} articulography, transmitter coils {{are placed}} in an equilateral triangle along the midsagittal plane at the forehead, chin, and neck. Because of the geometric orientation of the transmitter coils, accurate readings are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken {{as long as the}} sensor coils placed on the tongue stay within about a centimeter of the midsagittal plane and are not angled at more than 30 degrees.|$|E

5|$|It is {{important}} to note that the boundaries between category are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moved to allocate more or fewer clients to each category. It is normal to see fewer higher likelihood and/or consequence clients rather than 50% of the population or 50% of the assessed likelihood or consequence. In other words, the boundary is shifted so there can be a strong focus on the few assessed to be higher risk.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the mobile}} homes were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> remounted on their foundations, but 18–20 {{of the homes}} were unable to be repaired. The overall damage from the event was {{compared}} with the other events in southern California. While the Oceanside shock caused $200,000 in damage, the Palm Springs event caused an estimated $8 million in damage. Damage in from the Chalfant Valley event was estimated at $2.7 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} secrecy of the case, which was criticised by some {{contemporary}} observers, {{meant that it}} was not properly recorded or published, and the exact facts of the argument were not known for some time. As a result, whilst it sharply differs from later rulings such as Corbett v Corbett , it was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered as precedent in later judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} the first to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resupplied by the newly {{developed}} unmanned Progress freighters, although they could only dock at the rear port, as the front port lacked the plumbing used to refuel the propulsion system. The freighters docked automatically to the station via the Igla, and were then opened and emptied by the cosmonauts on board, whilst transfer of fuel to the station took place automatically under supervision from the ground.|$|E
5|$|Under the Lunacy Statute of 1867, the Master-in-Lunacy {{was able}} commit inebriates to an asylum for any period up to twelve months. Inebriates {{who were able}} to pay the lodging fees at private inebriate asylums were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> housed in inebriate-specific {{institutions}} such as Northcote Inebriate Asylum. Paupers were placed in lunatic asylums.|$|E

Its nose wheel locked up while landing due to ice accretion, {{but this was}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> repaired and the aircraft took off at 0:19am, local time. The repairs delayed the aircraft by 83 minutes, however. A84-201 arrived at Harewood Airport in Christchurch at 4:32am local time, and placed second in the race with a flight time of 22hours and 29minutes. The winning aircraft, RAF Canberra WE139, piloted by Flight Lieutenant Monty Burton completed its flight in 22hours and 25minutes. The £3,000 prize money awarded to Raw for placing second was later donated to the RAAF Welfare Trust Fund.|$|E
