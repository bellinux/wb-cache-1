40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a Transactionally Efficient Market Model, which evolves {{from the standard}} efficient market model, encompassing both transaction costs and bid-ask prices. Hence, we delve into how arbitrage makes its way within this complex setting. The main outgrowth of the analysis is the "trap set", which {{is the place where}} most of price trajectories should enter {{to put an end to}} supernormal profits, although the underlying dynamics seems far from coming to a halt, and becomes bewildering instead. Bid-ask arbitrage gaps will prove useful to track down those <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> <b>prices,</b> transaction costs and fundamental values. At this point, we define a transactionally efficacious market. Furthermore, a non linear dynamics whose environment gives room to mediator and microstructure, will lead us to prove the existence of a vectorial arbitrage gap mapping which becomes operational at managing the transactional efficiency of the market, in a complex surroundings with chaotic patterns eventually. Summing up: transactionally efficient markets are those markets which are informative efficient and transactionally efficacious. Dynamic Arbitrage; microstructure; transactional efficiency; chaos. ...|$|R

40|$|Falling {{information}} costs {{may give}} the perverse incentive to buy less information in equilibrium. Using a model similar to Admati and Pfleiderer (1988) {{but with a}} market that clears via an equilibrium condition, it is shown that passive investment may actually rise with lower information costs. This {{is consistent with the}} empirical observation that index investing has increased along with a decline in information costs. Also, in absence of such costs, no investor will hold index portfolios if at least some uninformed investors can condition on <b>current</b> <b>prices.</b> The existence <b>of</b> passive index investors may therefore be inconsistent with unrestricted observation <b>of</b> <b>current</b> <b>prices.</b> Finance Asset pricing Information...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} welfare {{effects of the}} {{relative}} price variability arising from inflation. When agents interact in anonymous markets, with customers buying from new suppliers each period, relative price variability benefits customers and cannot harm suppliers substantially. But if customers and suppliers form long-term relationships, prices have an informational role: a potential customer uses <b>current</b> <b>prices</b> as signals <b>of</b> future prices. Inflation reduces the informativeness <b>of</b> <b>current</b> <b>prices,</b> causing customers to make costly mistakes about which relationships to enter. In addition, the reduced informativeness of prices makes demand less price-elastic, thereby increasing markups. Both effects can be quantitatively significant at moderate inflation rates. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} new dynamic design for {{auctioning}} multiple heterogeneous commodities. An auctioneer wishes to allocate K types of commodities among n bidders. The auctioneer announces a vector <b>of</b> <b>current</b> <b>prices,</b> bidders report quantities demanded at these prices, and the auctioneer adjusts the prices. Units are credited to bidders at the <b>current</b> <b>prices</b> as their opponents' demands decline, {{and the process}} continues until every commodity market clears. Bidders, rather than being assumed to behave as price-takers, are permitted to strategically exercise their market power. Nevertheless, the proposed auction yields Walrasian equilibrium prices and, as from a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism, an efficient allocation. (JEL D 44) ...|$|R

Abstract calculation of loss is possible only when the contract goods have <b>current</b> <b>price.</b> <b>Current</b> <b>price</b> is the price generally charged for such goods sold under comparable circumstances in the trade concerned. According to the CISG and Serbian Law of Obligations, for the determination <b>of</b> the <b>current</b> <b>price</b> is relevant time of avoidance. This general rule is not applicable in international sales law when the party claiming damages has avoided the contract after taking over the goods. In that case, the <b>current</b> <b>price</b> at the time of taking over shall be applicable instead <b>of</b> the <b>current</b> <b>price</b> at the time <b>of</b> avoidance. <b>Current</b> <b>price</b> rule contained in the Art. 76 (2) of the CISG presupposes that the <b>current</b> <b>price</b> is the price prevailing at the place where the delivery of the goods should have been made, or if there is no <b>current</b> <b>price</b> at the place, the price at such other place as serves as a reasonable substitute, making due allowance for differences in the cost of transporting the goods.
