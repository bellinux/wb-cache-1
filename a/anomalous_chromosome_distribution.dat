MÉTODOS: cinco pacientes inférteis com SOP e oito pacientes controles, submetidas à estimulação ovariana para injeção intracitoplasmática de espermatozóide, foram selecionadas prospectiva e consecutivamente, e constituíram os grupos de estudo e Controle, respectivamente. Oócitos imaturos captados após estimulação ovariana para a realização de injeção intracitoplasmática de espermatozóide (21 e 29, respectivamente, nos Grupos SOP e Controle) foram submetidos à MIV. Apenas os oócitos que apresentaram a extrusão do primeiro corpúsculo polar após a MIV foram fixados e submetidos à imunocoloração e análise por microscopia de fluorescência para avaliação morfológica do fuso e da distribuição cromossômica. A análise estatística foi realizada utilizando o teste exato de Fisher, com significância estatística quando p PURPOSE: to {{evaluate}} the meiotic spindle and the chromosome distribution of in vitro matured oocytes obtained from stimulated cycles of infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and with male factor and/or tubal infertility (Control Group) and compare in vitro maturation (IVM) rates between the groups analyzed. METHODS: five infertile patients with PCOS and eight controls, submitted to stimulated cycles for intracytoplasmic sperm injection, were selected prospectively and consecutively, and respectively assigned to the study group and the Control Group. Immature oocytes (21 and 29, respectively, from PCOS and Control Group) were submitted to IVM. After IVM, oocytes with first polar body extruded were fixed and submitted to immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy for morphological evaluation of the spindle and of chromosome distribution. Statistical analysis was performed by the Fisher test with significance, when p< 0. 05. RESULTS: IVM rates were similar between groups (47. 6 e 44. 8 %, respectively, for PCOS and Control Group). Six of the ten oocytes (60 %) from the study group and four of the 12 oocytes (33. 3 %) from the Control Group presented meiotic anomalies of the spindle and/or <b>anomalous</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>distribution,</b> without statistical difference between groups.

40|$|By {{a screen}} {{designed}} to isolate new fission yeast genes required for chromosome segregation, {{we have identified}} mal 2 +. The conditionally lethal mal 2 - 1 allele gives rise to increased loss of a nonessential minichromosome at the permissive temperature and leads to severe missegregation of the chromosomes at the nonpermissive temperature. Cloning by complementation and subsequent sequence analysis revealed that mal 2 is a novel protein with a mass of 34 kDa. Cells containing a mal 2 null allele were inviable, indicating that mal 2 + is an essential gene. Fusion of mal 2 protein to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) showed that mal 2 was predominantly localized in the nucleus. Sensitivity to microtubule-destabilizing drugs and strong genetic interactions with alpha 1 -tubulin suggest an interaction of the mal 2 protein with the microtubule system. Spindle formation and elongation were not detectably affected in the mal 2 - 1 mutant as determined by indirect immunofluorescence.

40|$|Variation in {{chromosome}} number due to polyploidy can seriously compromise meiotic stability. In autopolyploids, {{the presence of}} more than two homologous chromosomes may result in complex pairing patterns and subsequent <b>anomalous</b> <b>chromosome</b> segregation. In this context, chromocenter, centromeric, telomeric and ribosomal DNA locus topology and DNA methylation patterns were investigated in the natural autotetraploid, Arabidopsis arenosa. The data show that homologous chromosome recognition and association initiates at telomeric domains in premeiotic interphase, followed by quadrivalent pairing of ribosomal 45 S RNA gene loci (known as NORs) at leptotene. On the other hand, centromeric regions at early leptotene show pairwise associations rather than associations in fours.

These results show for the first time that nuclear distribution patterns of 5 -mC are simultaneously reshuffled in meiocytes and anther somatic cells.

40|$|The {{flawless}} <b>distribution</b> of <b>chromosomes</b> to {{the daughter}} cells in mitosis depends {{in part on}} unlikely sources- microtubule instability and chance events. Equal <b>chromosome</b> <b>distribution</b> results from the regular arrangement of microtubules shown in Fig. 1. The result is attachment of the partner chromosomes to opposite spindle poles and their movement to opposite poles in anaphase, so that each daughter cell will contain one copy of each chromosome. Attachment probably arises from the capture of spindle micro-tubules by kinetochores. Capture is facilitated by a novel form of instability called 'dynamic instability', which is driven by GTP hydrolysis or at least leads to GTP hydrolysis. Thus, energy {{may be used to}} pur-chase lability rather than stable bonds (for reviews see Kirschner & Mitchison, 1986; Cassimeris et al. 1987).

The simulated genome structure largely fluctuates with the diffusive movement of chromosomes. This fluctuation, however, is not completely random, as parts of chromosomes distribute in characteristic ways to form “territories” in the nucleus.

Such a pattern of anaphase <b>chromosome</b> <b>distribution</b> has been described once before, but was ascribed to fusion of the chromosomes. The bowing of chromosome rows in Tilia is explainable quantitatively by the constant poleward velocity of the chromosomes during anaphase. Peripheral chromosomes are moving both relative to the spindle axis and laterally closer to the axis, whereas chromosomes lying on the spindle axis possess no lateral component in their motion, and thus at uniform velocity progress more rapidly than peripheral chromosomes relative to the spindle axis.
