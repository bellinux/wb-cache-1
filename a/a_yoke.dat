They can also help prevent the O-ring of <b>a</b> <b>yoke</b> type valve from falling out. The plug may be vented so that the leakage of gas from the cylinder does not pressurise the plug, {{making it difficult to}} remove.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of the wheel was a major technological innovation {{that gave rise to}} chariot warfare. At first, equines, both horses and onagers, were hitched to wheeled carts by means of <b>a</b> <b>yoke</b> around their necks {{in a manner similar to}} that of oxen. However, such a design is incompatible with equine anatomy, limiting both the strength and mobility of the animal. By the time of the Hyksos invasions of Egypt, c.1600 BC, horses were pulling chariots with an improved harness design that made use of a breastcollar and breeching, which allowed a horse to move faster and pull more weight.|$|E

50|$|The emblem is tierced per fess: {{the first}} of azure, the second <b>an</b> <b>yoke</b> on or and the third of gules. The {{insignia}} symbolize some peculiarities of the municipality.

25|$|Regardless of the {{specific}} date of domestication, use of horses spread rapidly across Eurasia for transportation, agricultural work and warfare. Horses and mules in agriculture used a breastplate type harness or <b>a</b> <b>yoke</b> more suitable for oxen, which was not as efficient at utilizing the full strength of the animals as the later-invented padded horse collar that arose several millennia later.|$|E
25|$|Another type of gown {{is called}} the lay type gown, {{which is similar to}} the MA gown in that it has long closed sleeves, but does not have <b>a</b> <b>yoke.</b> Instead, there is a flap collar with the gathers {{underneath}} it. Thus it is less voluminous than the clerical type gown. This gown is often used for the dress of officers and graduates of some degrees (especially at Oxford and Durham).|$|E

25|$|A provincial, {{though not}} crude, small (7.5cm high) Roman bronze of a seated Epona, {{flanked by a}} small mare and stallion, found in England, is conserved in the British Museum. Lying on her lap and on the patera raised {{in her right hand}} are disproportionately large ears of grain; ears of grain also {{protrude}} from the mouths of the ponies, whose heads are turned towards the goddess. On her left arm she holds <b>a</b> <b>yoke,</b> which curves up above her shoulder, an attribute unique to this bronze statuette.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} features of the tomb is the presence of carved symbols on the slabs inside the chamber. Lines are formed of rows of individual punched dots, possibly applied with a very early metal tool. One of the more common symbols is a simple line with an attached open semicircle, usually interpreted as a stylised depiction of cattle. Normally, two of these symbols are linked by a further line with emphasised terminals. This may be a simple depiction of a plough. More rarely, two of them are linked by what resembles <b>a</b> <b>yoke</b> and pole, suggesting a cart. Occasionally overlapping signs suggest that the individual carvings are in no meaningful relationship to one another, but represent an accumulation of individual signs. Similar depiction of teams of cattle are known from much more recent (Bronze or Iron Age) carvings at Valcamonica near Capo di Ponte, Northern Italy and at Mont Bégo in the French part of the Ligurian Alps. The symbols are normally assumed to reflect Neolithic ideological or religious ideas.|$|E

25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was connected}} to the wings in proximity of the nose of the aircraft, while the empennage was located at its rear end. Both the horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer were composed of twin aerodynamic surfaces. The wings were fitted with ailerons and had a conventional structure, with tubular plywood spars and wooden ribs supporting a fabric covering. Between the interplane struts that connected the two wings (which, together with wires, provided structural rigidity) were some vertical surfaces that improved the stability of the aircraft. The tail assembly was composed of two vertical surfaces which acted as rudders and as stabilizers and of two horizontal surfaces whose fixed portion had a lifting and a stabilizing function, while a movable section acted as an elevator. The latter was controlled by the pilot, thanks to <b>a</b> <b>yoke.</b> The wings were fitted with a patented device that allowed its angle of incidence to vary, in order to experiment with different aerodynamic conditions; the tailplanes were fitted with a similar device in order to compensate for the attitude changes caused by the adjustment of the wings.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} thirty-one he {{was already}} Minister of Finance {{at the end of}} 1873. He started his career as a protégé of the leader of the {{subsequent}} Liberal Party, Jovan Ristić, but soon joined the club of so-called young conservatives who turned into a kind of the personal party of the Serbian ruler, Prince Milan Obrenović (Prince from 1868, and King from 1882 till 1889). In the Government of Jovan Marinović, from November 1873 till December 1874 he was Minister of Finance for the second time and in that capacity he was instrumental in bringing important reforms. He introduced the metric system to Serbia. Serbia joined the Latin Monetary Union and he baptised the new domestic currency, the dinar, after mediaeval Serbian silver coins. He always considered his most important achievement in this government the law stipulating the amount of property that had to be left to peasants, and could not be confiscated to cover their debts. This minimal amount included peasant's house, <b>a</b> <b>yoke</b> of oxen, the plough, and five acres of land. He was elected for the third time as Minister of Finance in the Government of Danilo Stefanović (Stefanović) in 1875.|$|E
