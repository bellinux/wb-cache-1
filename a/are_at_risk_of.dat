5|$|College {{students}} <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> {{engaging in}} poor sleep hygiene {{and also of}} being unaware of the resulting effects of sleep deprivation. Because of irregular weekly schedules and the campus environment, college students may be likely to have variable sleep-wake schedules across the week, take naps, drink caffeine or alcohol near bedtime, and sleep in disruptive sleeping environments. Because of this, {{it is important to}} have sleep hygiene education on college campuses.|$|E

5|$|A {{crowdsourcing}} {{project called}} Condor Watch (CW) was started on April 14, 2014, {{hosted by the}} web portal Zooniverse. Volunteers are asked to examine motion-capture images of California condors associated with release sites managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service and Ventana Wildlife Society. The tasks on the website include identifying tagged condors and marking the distance to feeding sources such as animal carcasses. Biologists can then use this data to deduce which birds <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> lead poisoning.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} thyroglossal duct is {{the most}} common clinically significant congenital disorder of the thyroid gland. A persistent sinus tract may remain as a vestigial remnant of the tubular development of the thyroid gland. Parts of this tube may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form thyroglossal cysts. Preterm neonates <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed to meet their postnatal needs. In order to detect hypothyroidism in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life, many countries have newborn screening programs at birth.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{have been}} hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; {{they have been}} used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance. With their {{powerful}} physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> extirpation in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, bears {{have come}} under {{pressure}} through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market, though hunting is now banned, largely replaced by farming. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable; even the two least concern species, the brown bear and the American black bear, <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> extirpation in certain areas. In general these two species inhabit remote areas with little interaction with humans, and the main non-natural causes of mortality are hunting, trapping, road-kill and depredation.|$|E
5|$|Since 1999 the RAAF has put its Hornets {{through a}} series of {{upgrades}} to improve their effectiveness. However, the aircraft are becoming increasingly difficult to operate and <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> being outclassed by the fighters and air-defence systems operated by other countries. As a result, the RAAF will begin to retire its F/A-18s in the late 2010s, and the last aircraft will leave service in the early 2020s. Under current Australian Government planning they will be replaced by 72 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II fighters.|$|E

Genetic counseling benefits these individuals by updating their knowledge, seeking to dispel any unfounded beliefs that they may have, and helping them consider their future options and plans. Also covered is information concerning family planning choices, care management, and other considerations.|$|E

5|$|Those {{with severe}} {{encephalopathy}} (stages 3 and 4) <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> obstructing their airway due to decreased protective reflexes {{such as the}} gag reflex. This can lead to respiratory arrest. Transferring the person {{to a higher level}} of nursing care, such as an intensive care unit, is required and intubation of the airway is often necessary to prevent life-threatening complications (e.g., aspiration or respiratory failure). Placement of a nasogastric tube permits the safe administration of nutrients and medication.|$|E
5|$|Timid and skittish, the {{blacktip reef shark}} is {{difficult}} to approach and seldom poses a danger to humans unless roused by food. However, people wading through shallow water <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> having their legs mistakenly bitten. This shark is used for its meat, fins, and liver oil, but is {{not considered to be}} a commercially significant species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the blacktip reef shark as Near Threatened. Although the species as a whole remains widespread and relatively common, overfishing of this slow-reproducing shark has led to its decline at a number of locales.|$|E
5|$|Whitetip reef {{sharks are}} rarely {{aggressive}} towards humans, {{though they may}} investigate swimmers closely. However, spear fishers <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> being bitten by one attempting to steal their catch. This species is caught for food, though ciguatera poisoning resulting from its consumption has been reported. The IUCN has assessed the whitetip reef shark as Near Threatened, noting its numbers are dwindling due to increasing levels of unregulated fishing activity across its range. The slow reproductive rate and limited habitat preferences of this species renders its populations vulnerable to overfishing.|$|E

5|$|Women and men {{differ in}} their {{chromosomal}} makeup, protein gene products, genomic imprinting, gene expression, signaling pathways, and hormonal environment. All of these necessitate caution in extrapolating information derived from biomarkers from one sex to the other. Women are particularly vulnerable at the two extremes of life. Young women and adolescents are at risk from STIs, pregnancy and unsafe abortion, while older women often have few resources and are disadvantaged with respect to men, and also <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> dementia and abuse, and generally poor health.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> {{being exposed to}} HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners {{because they believe that}} children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E
5|$|Humans play a {{key role}} in the biosphere, with the large human {{population}} dominating many of Earth's ecosystems. This has resulted in a widespread, ongoing mass extinction of other species during the present geological epoch, now known as the Holocene extinction. The large-scale loss of species caused by human influence since the 1950s has been called a biotic crisis, with an estimated 10% of the total species lost as of 2007. At current rates, about 30% of species <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> extinction in the next hundred years. The Holocene extinction event is the result of habitat destruction, the widespread distribution of invasive species, hunting, and climate change. In the present day, human activity has had a significant impact on the surface of the planet. More than a third of the land surface has been modified by human actions, and humans use about 20% of global primary production. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by close to 30% since the start of the Industrial Revolution.|$|E
