40|$|Publish/subscribe systems utilize filter {{algorithms}} {{to determine}} all subscriptions matching incoming event messages. To distribute such services, subscriptions are forwarded to several <b>filter</b> <b>components.</b> This approach allows for {{an application of}} routing algo-rithms that selectively forward event messages to only a subset of <b>filter</b> <b>components.</b> Beneficial effects of this scheme include decreasing network and compu-tational load in single <b>filter</b> <b>components.</b> So far, we can find routing optimizations that ex-ploit coverings among subscriptions or utilize sub-scription merging strategies. Generally, such opti-mizations aim at {{reducing the amount of}} subscrip-tions forwarded to <b>filter</b> <b>components,</b> which decreases their computational load. This might in turn result in an increasing number of event messages routed through the network. However, current optimization strategies only work on restrictive conjunctive subscriptions and can-not be extended to efficiently support arbitrary sub-scriptions. Furthermore, {{it is not possible to}} apply covering and perfect merging strategies in all appli-cation scenarios due to the strong dependency of these approaches on actually registered subscriptions. In this paper, we present a novel optimization ap-proach, subscription generalization, to decrease the filtering overhead in publish/subscribe systems. Our approach is based on selectivities of subscriptions and can be utilized for all kinds of subscriptions includ-ing arbitrary Boolean and conjunctive subscriptions. We propose a simple subscription generalization al-gorithm and show an evaluation of the results of a first series of experiments proving the usefulness of our approach...|$|R

Metalcraft has specialized in improving the reliability of existing tilting pan filters by providing <b>filter</b> <b>components</b> that increase filtration area, improve flow characteristics, increase structural integrity, and reduce maintenance cost. The optimization process involves diligent onsite technological study, mapping and modeling of an existing filter. Benchmarks are established as to the operational and maintenance condition of the filter, and mechanical deficiencies can be addressed. Filter measurements and data are integrated into the modeling software to revel accurate real time conditions, which then can be compared with corrected or improved modeling of all <b>filter</b> <b>components.</b> The extent of improvements and optimization are discussed with the client and further steps are planned {{in harmony with the}} customer's goals. Continuation of the optimization process allows for implementing improved cloth spray header system matched with a turnover track that is properly timed in relationship to the sprays and dumping cycle. Applying these technologies will result in improved losses, better cloth cleaning efficiencies, extended run time between cloth changes, and lower maintenance cost.
