The fortifications were built over {{thousands}} of years, from around 1450 BC to the mid-20th century, and they <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the Maltese islands' strategic position and natural harbours, which have made them very desirable for various powers.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of commercially available synthetic diamonds are yellow and {{are produced by}} so-called high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) processes. The yellow color is caused by nitrogen impurities.

5|$|Voidites are {{octahedral}} nanometer-sized clusters {{present in}} many natural diamonds, as revealed by electron microscopy. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that annealing of type-IaB diamond at high temperatures and pressures (>2600 °C) results in break-up of the platelets and formation of dislocation loops and voidites, i.e. that voidites <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> thermal degradation of platelets. Contrary to platelets, voidites do contain much nitrogen, in the molecular form.|$|E

5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{the most}} common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths. Of these more than three quarters <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> coronary artery disease and stroke. Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others. Cardiovascular diseases frequently do not have symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, and ultrasound. Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.|$|E
5|$|Mount Elbert {{is part of}} the Sawatch Range, an uplift of the Laramide Orogeny which {{separated}} from the Mosquito Range to the east around 28 million years ago. The tops of this range were heavily glaciated, leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues. For example, the base of Elbert on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and metamorphic rocks deposited when the glaciers receded, which lie on a lateral moraine. Further up the eastern side there is a large cirque with a small tarn. There are also lakes to both the north and south, Turquoise and Twin Lakes respectively; the Twin Lakes <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the natural dam of end moraines, and Turquoise Lake was created by the manmade Sugar Loaf Dam.|$|E
5|$|Radar studies {{preceding}} {{and following}} the Lunar Prospector mission demonstrate that the inner walls of Shackleton are similar in reflective characteristics to those of some sunlit craters. In particular, the surroundings appear to contain {{a significant number of}} blocks in its ejecta blanket, suggesting that its radar properties <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> surface roughness, and not ice deposits, as was previously suggested from a radar experiment involving the Clementine mission. This interpretation, however, is not universally agreed upon within the scientific community. Radar images of the crater at a wavelength of 13cm show no evidence for water ice deposits.|$|E

5|$|The Mono–Inyo {{chain of}} craters lies in east-central California, roughly {{parallel}} to the eastern escarpment of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Volcanism and seismic activity in eastern California <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> two major geologic processes: northwest movement of the Pacific Plate {{with respect to the}} North American Plate along the San Andreas Fault system near the coast, and east–west extension of the crust that formed the Basin and Range Province.

5|$|The National Cancer Institute {{estimated}} 22,070 {{new cases}} of primary brain cancer and 12,920 deaths due to the illness in the United State in 2009. The age-adjusted incidence rate is 6.4 per 100,000 per year, and the death rate is 4.3 per 100,000 per year. The lifetime risk of developing brain cancer for someone born today is 0.60%. Only around {{a third of those}} diagnosed with brain cancer survive for five years after diagnosis. These high overall mortality rates <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the prevalence of aggressive types, such as glioblastoma multiforme. Nearly 14% of new brain tumor diagnoses occur in persons under 20 years of age.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound of}} speech can be {{analyzed}} into a combination of segmental and suprasegmental elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> their different articulations, {{and they can be}} either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as stress, phonation type, voice timbre, and prosody or intonation, all of which may have effects across multiple segments.|$|E

5|$|There are argentiferous (i.e. silver-bearing) galena {{deposits}} on Flat Holm; {{the pits}} and mounds {{visible on the}} surface of the island <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> trial borings. A dispute over lead mining rights in the 1780s ended with John Stuart, Lord Mount Stuart making an official complaint that the lighthouse keeper was using the coals intended for the lighthouse for processing lead. Mining for lead was not profitable, however, and the works were abandoned. Red marl from the Triassic Period fills joints in the Carboniferous Limestone showing evidence of karstic (cave forming) processes during this period. Caves on the western and north-eastern sides of the island were used during the years of smuggling.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, {{observations}} from Earth {{were made of}} Triton's limb as it passed in front of stars. These observations indicated {{the presence of a}} denser atmosphere than was deduced from Voyager 2 data. Other observations have shown an increase in temperature by 5% from 1989 to 1998. These observations indicate Triton is approaching an unusually warm summer season that happens only once every few hundred years. Theories for this warming include a change of frost patterns on Triton's surface and a change in ice albedo, which would allow more heat to be absorbed. Another theory argues the changes in temperature <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> deposition of dark, red material from geological processes. Because Triton's Bond albedo is among the highest within the Solar System, it is sensitive to small variations in spectral albedo.|$|E

5|$|Since 1988, the American {{black duck}} has been rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This {{is because the}} range of this species is {{extremely}} large, which is not near the threshold of vulnerable species. In addition, the total population is large, and, although it is declining, it is not declining fast {{enough to make the}} species vulnerable. It has long been valued as a game bird, being extremely wary and fast flying. Habitat loss due to drainage, filling of wetlands due to urbanization, global warming and rising sea levels are major reasons for the declining population. Some conservationists consider hybridization and competition with the mallard as an additional source of concern should this decline continue. Hybridization itself is not a major problem; natural selection makes sure that the best-adapted individuals have the most offspring. However, the reduced viability of female hybrids causes some broods to fail in the long run due to the death of the offspring before reproducing themselves. While this is not a problem in the plentiful mallard, it might place an additional strain on the American black duck's population. Recent research conducted for the Delta Waterfowl Foundation suggests that hybrids <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> forced copulations and not a normal pairing choice by black hens.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{is often}} {{said to be a}} {{cultural}} melting pot, taking in influences from across the world and creating distinctively new methods of cultural expression. Though aspects of American music {{can be traced back to}} specific origins, claiming any particular original culture for a musical element is inherently problematic, due to the constant evolution of American music through transplanting and hybridizing techniques, instruments and genres. Elements of foreign musics arrived in the United States both through the formal sponsorship of educational and outreach events by individuals and groups, and through informal processes, as in the incidental transplantation of West African music through slavery, and Irish music through immigration. The most distinctly American musics <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> cross-cultural hybridization through close contact. Slavery, for example, mixed persons from numerous tribes in tight living quarters, resulting in a shared musical tradition that was enriched through further hybridizing with elements of indigenous, Latin, and European music. American ethnic, religious, and racial diversity has also produced such intermingled genres as the French-African music of the Louisiana Creoles, the Native, Mexican and European fusion Tejano music, and the thoroughly hybridized slack-key guitar and other styles of modern Hawaiian music.|$|E
5|$|The {{auxiliary}} Marōdo Shrine at Itsukushima Shrine originates {{from the}} 13th-century Kamakura period, and the honden and haiden of the Kibitsu Shrine {{date from the}} 15th-century Muromachi period. In the late 16th century and early 17th century, during the Momoyama period, gongen-zukuri was introduced as a new plan of building shrines. The main hall was joined to the oratory via a connecting structure called the ai-no-ma, derived from the hachiman-zukuri style. Examples of gongen-zukuri are the honden at Kitano Tenman-gū and Ōsaki Hachiman Shrine. Tōshō-gū dates from the Edo period and was completed in 1636. It is a complex assembly of richly adorned shrines, temples and a mausoleum. Such complexes <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism which began to appear during the Heian period; Kitano Tenman-gū, built in 947 for the spirit of Sugawara no Michizane, {{was the first of}} these byō or jingū-ji.|$|E

5|$|The strong {{rotating}} {{winds of}} a tropical cyclone <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> {{the conservation of}} angular momentum imparted by the Earth's rotation as air flows inwards toward the axis of rotation. As a result, they rarely form within 5° of the equator. Tropical cyclones are also almost completely absent from Earth’s southwestern quartersphere, mainly because {{the shapes of the}} African and South American continents permit the Benguela and Humboldt Currents to cover ocean basins as far north as 5˚N with excessively cool water. These powerful cold currents also produce much stronger vertical wind shear in the South Atlantic and Southeast Pacific, which typically prevent tropical depressions and minor storms there from developing into cyclones and prevent even the waters of the Brazil Current from being so hot as analogous western boundary currents or ocean gyres. Also, the African easterly jet and areas of atmospheric instability which gives rise to cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, along with the Asian monsoon and Western Pacific Warm Pool, are feature of the Northern Hemisphere and Australia.|$|E
