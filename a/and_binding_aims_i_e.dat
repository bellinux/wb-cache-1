40|$|If legacy code {{has to be}} {{integrated}} into an application, it is often necessary to call this code available as source code written in a particular programming language or available in binary format for a particular computing platform from another programming language or from a remote machine. For this reason, wrapping code has to be developed for each source code library or binary code to {{be integrated}}. This paper presents an extensible framework that supports legacy code integration by modeling legacy code not only {{in a way that}} is programming (language) independent, but also by supporting different input and output types <b>and</b> <b>bindings.</b> This <b>aim</b> is achieved by the use of an integrated plug-in mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from the}} pluralistic view of {{morality}} {{proposed by the}} moral foundations theory, this paper aims at highlighting the plurality of personal moral concerns that may drive people to collective action and at investigating how they are connected with other personal and group-based motivations to act (i. e., moral obligation, moral convictions, politicized group identity, group efficacy, and groupbased anger). Moral foundations can be distinguished into individualizing foundations, aimed at protecting individual rights <b>and</b> well-being; <b>and</b> <b>binding</b> foundations, <b>aimed</b> at tightening people into ordered communities. We expected that collective action intention would be most strongly associated with an individualizing foundation in equality-focused movements, <b>and</b> with a <b>binding</b> foundation in conformity-focused ones. Four studies that examined activists of both liberal and conservative movements confirmed these expectations. The relevant foundations predicted collective action mainly through the mediation of moral obligation and politicized identity, but they also had some effects above and beyond them...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe hematopoietic colony {{stimulating}} factor- 1 receptor (CSF- 1 R or FMS) {{is essential}} for the cellular repertoire of the mammalian immune system. Here, we report a structural and mechanistic consensus for the assembly of human and mouse CSF- 1 :CSF- 1 R complexes. The EM structure of the complete extracellular assembly of the human CSF- 1 :CSF- 1 R complex reveals how receptor dimerization by CSF- 1 invokes a ternary complex featuring extensive homotypic receptor contacts and striking structural plasticity at the extremities of the complex. Studies by small-angle X-ray scattering of unliganded hCSF- 1 R point to large domain rearrangements upon CSF- 1 <b>binding,</b> <b>and</b> provide structural evidence for the relevance of receptor predimerization at the cell surface. Comparative structural <b>and</b> <b>binding</b> studies <b>aiming</b> to dissect the assembly principles of human and mouse CSF- 1 R complexes, including a quantification of the CSF- 1 /CSF- 1 R species cross-reactivity, show that bivalent cytokine binding to receptor coupled to ensuing receptor-receptor interactions are common denominators in extracellular complex formation...|$|R
40|$|In Italy Origanum vulgare L. is {{cultivated}} only in {{few areas}} and its production {{does not even}} satisfy the national market demand. Until now the interest on this crop has been very low {{because of the high}} cost of manual harvest <b>and</b> bunch <b>binding.</b> The <b>aim</b> of this work is to evaluate the use of a reaper-binder (made for harvesting cereal crops) for harvesting <b>and</b> bunch <b>binding</b> Origanum vulgare L. The tests were carried out in Sicily, in the summer of 2001. The mechanical harvest was carried out using the reaper-binder unmodified, but the results were not satisfactory. The machine was then modified reducing its forward speed and cutting height, in order to improve its working productivity and harvesting quality. The tests of mechanical harvest were compared to parallel manual harvest tests. The results show that the modified reaper-binder has a working productivity much higher than that obtained with the manual harvest. Moreover, its harvesting quality (bunch size <b>and</b> <b>binding</b> height) is similar to that obtained manually...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, it is {{estimated}} that nearly 4 million people fall victim to people traffickers every year. Trafficking is carried out mainly by Organised Criminal Networks and the victims are forced into prostitution, illegal labour, domestic slavery and petty crime. On 1 April 2009, the United Kingdom signed up to the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. The Convention, which has to date been ratified by 20 European countries, is legally <b>binding</b> <b>and</b> <b>aims</b> to promote and protect the rights of victims who have been tricked or forced into leaving their homes, moved to another country, or within their own country, and then exploited. Whilst it is national governments who are signatories to the Council of Europe Convention, local authorities have a key role to play in its successful implementation...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{phenomena}} such as temperature have {{an increasingly}} important role in performance and reliability of modern process technologies. This trend will only strengthen with future generations. Attempts to minimize the design effort required for reaching closure in reliability and performance constraints are agreeing {{on the fact that}} higher levels of design abstractions need to be made aware of lower level physical phenomena. In this paper, we investigated techniques to incorporate temperature-awareness into high-level synthesis. Specifically, we developed two temperature-aware resource allocation <b>and</b> <b>binding</b> algorithms that <b>aim</b> to minimize the maximum temperature that can be reached by a resource in a design. Such a control scheme {{will have an impact on}} the prevention of hot spots, which in turn is one of the major hurdles in front of reliability for future integrated circuits. Our algorithms are able to reduce the maximum attained temperature by any module in a design by up to 19. 6 o C compared to a binding that optimizes switching power...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Environmental {{chemicals}} and heavy metals may alter thyroid hormone levels via several mechanisms, including disruption of iodine (I) transport, thyroid peroxi¬dase, thyroid hormone-binding proteins, hepatic catabolism, deiodinases, <b>and</b> receptor <b>binding.</b> Our <b>aim</b> {{was to investigate}} the change in thyroid hormone levels in cadmium exposure. Material and Method: Painters, welders, miners, and smelters with an occupational exposure of more than 10 years, aged between 18 - 70 years, were divided into six groups according to whole blood cadmium levels (Group 1 : 0 - 0. 5 µg/L; Group 2 : 0. 5 - 1 µg/L; Group 3 : 1 - 1. 5 µg/L; Group 4 : 1. 5 - 2 µg/L; Group 5 : 2 - 2. 5 µg/L; Group 6 : > 2. 5 µg/L). Results: There was a positive correlation between cadmium and serum free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. There was a negative correlation between cadmium and serum alanine aminotransferase and vitamin B 12 levels. Discussion: Cadmium exposure was found to lead to an increase in thyroid hormone levels...|$|R

40|$|Seasonal {{changes have}} been {{observed}} in stallion sperm morphology. Since carbohydrates of sperm glycocalyx {{play a key role}} in the sperm-egg recognition <b>and</b> zona <b>binding,</b> the <b>aim</b> of this study was to evaluate the distribution of carbohydrates in stallion ejaculates collected in two different periods of the year using lectin histochemistry. Semen from two fertile trotters was collected in winter (January) and summer (July) (3 ejaculates for each time), diluted in Tyrode’s medium, fixed in 4 % (w/v) neutral formalin, smeared on slides and incubated with appropriate dilutions of 12 lectins. The spermatozoa from winter ejaculates reacted with 1) MAL II, SNA, HPA, Con A, WGA and GSA II in the whole cell surface, 2) PNA, RCA 120 and SBA in the acrosomal region, 3) GSA I-B 4 in the entire head, 4) DBA and UEA I in the post-acrosomal region and tail. The spermatozoa contained in summer ejaculates did not show GSA I-B 4 reactivity, whereas they displayed SBA affinity also in post-acrosomal region which was unreactive to UEA I. In addition, the tail of July collected spermatozoa did not contain binding sites for UEA I and GSA II. These results suggest that the expression of oligosaccharide sequences of stallion sperm glycocalyx is time-dependent and that the acrosomal region shows a more stable glycoconjugate pattern with respect to other regions. Lastly, carbohydrate pattern of the glycocalyx could be important in the assessment of semen quality in stallions...|$|R
