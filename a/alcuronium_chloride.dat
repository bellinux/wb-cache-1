40|$|T h: {{antagonism}} between tubocurarine and <b>alcuronium</b> <b>chloride</b> on the {{one hand}} and neostigmine, physostigmine, edrophonium and ambenonium on the other have been investigated. A quantitative measure of antagonism was obtained on the rat diaphragm preparation and it was found that in general the antagonists were more effective against <b>alcuronium</b> <b>chloride</b> than against tubocurarine. The antagonist drugs potentiated the action of acetylcholine on frog rectus muscle. The muscarinic action of ambenonium was less apparent than that of the other drugs but it caused severe reduction in amplitude of cardiac contraction and arrest in 50 per cent of the preparations. It is concluded that ambenonium is unlikely to prove a satisfactory drug for further investigation in man. Neostigmine is almost universally used, in the United Kingdom at least, as an antagonist to tubocurarine. It serves the purpose adequately and cases of neostigmine-resistant curarization are very rare, much rarer indeed than was suggested by the correspondence which followed the origina...|$|E
40|$|Changes {{in middle}} {{cerebral}} arterial flow velocity (MCAV) during rapid intravenous induction and awake intubation using transcranial Doppler sonography were investigated. The study involved 20 patients without disorders {{of the central}} nervous or cardiovascular systems who were scheduled for maxillofacial surgery. In the intravenous induction group, anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental, and orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation was facilitated with succinylcholine chloride or <b>alcuronium</b> <b>chloride.</b> In the awake intubation group, orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation was performed under intravenous sedation with diazepam and topical anesthesia with 4 % lidocaine. Arterial blood pressures, heart rate, and MCAV were monitored at specific intervals. During intravenous induction, blood pressures decreased after the administration of thiopental and muscle relaxants and increased during endotracheal intubation. MCAV was remarkably slowed after the administration of thiopental and during mask ventilation. During awake intubation, blood pressures were increased by endotracheal intubation. MCAV was decreased from the administration of diazepam to the transtracheal injection of lidocaine, but returned to the control value from endotracheal spray to endotracheal intubation. These results suggest that smooth awake intubation may be the safest method of induction for patients with cerebrovascular disorders...|$|E
