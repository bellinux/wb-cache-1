5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E

500|$|For GTAW {{of carbon}} and {{stainless}} steels, {{the selection of}} a filler material is important to prevent excessive porosity. Oxides on the filler material and workpieces must be removed before welding to prevent contamination, and immediately prior to welding, alcohol or acetone should be used to clean the surface. Preheating is generally not necessary for mild steels less than one inch thick, but low alloy steels may require preheating to slow the cooling process and prevent the formation of martensite in the heat-affected zone. [...] Tool steels should also be preheated to prevent cracking in the heat-affected zone. <b>Austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> steels do not require preheating, but martensitic and ferritic chromium stainless steels do. A DCEN power source is normally used, and thoriated electrodes, tapered to a sharp point, are recommended. Pure argon is used for thin workpieces, but helium can be introduced as thickness increases.|$|E
500|$|The Chrysler Building uses silvery [...] "Enduro KA-2" [...] metal {{extensively}} in its design. The metal is an <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> steel developed in Germany by Krupp and marketed under the trade name [...] "Nirosta" [...] (a German acronym for nichtrostender Stahl, meaning [...] "non-rusting steel"). The Nirosta steel, whose first use in an American project {{was in the}} Chrysler Building, was was {{also referred to as}} [...] "18-8 stainless steel" [...] because it was composed of 18% chromium and 8% nickel. Nirosta was used in the exterior ornaments, the window frames, the crown, and the needle. The steel {{was an integral part of}} Van Alen's design, as E.E. Thum explains: [...] "The use of permanently bright metal was of greatest aid in the carrying of rising lines and the diminishing circular forms in the roof treatment, so as to accentuate the gradual upward swing until it literally dissolves into the sky...." [...] Stainless steel producers used the Chrysler Building to experiment with the durability of stainless steel in architecture. In 1929, the American Society for Testing Materials created a stainless steel inspection committee. Its members saw the Chrysler Building as the best location to study the effect of the environment on stainless steel, so they created a smaller subcommittee to examine the building's panels every five years. The inspections were canceled after 1960 because the panels had shown minimal deterioration.|$|E

50|$|Another control {{technique}} for preventing intergranular corrosion involves incorporating strong carbide formers or stabilizing {{elements such as}} niobium or titanium in the stainless steels.
