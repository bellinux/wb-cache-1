5|$|While {{some other}} designs use clamps to couple the disc to the platter, Roksan shares the same {{philosophy}} as Linn in believing that rigid coupling would cause rumble to be transmitted {{from the main}} bearing, thus colouring the sound. To further increase isolation, the Xerxes possesses <b>a</b> <b>spindle</b> that allows the user to centre the record, but {{which is supposed to}} be removed during listening so that the disc rests solely on the felt mat.|$|E
5|$|The basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 24–33 by 6.6–8.8μm, {{and may be}} {{attached}} to anywhere from one to four spores, although four-spored basidia are most common. They are hyaline to sometimes somewhat yellowish, club-shaped or roughly cylindrical, and some have a slight constriction around the middle. The cheilocystidia (cystidia {{on the edge of}} a gill) are abundant, forming a sterile band on the gill edge. They are hyaline, fusoid-ampullaceous (with a shape ranging from <b>a</b> <b>spindle</b> to a swollen bottle), with dimensions of 20–45 by 5–8.2μm, and have a filamentous neck measuring 6–11 by 1.6–2.5μm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are scattered, similar to the cheilocystidia in form and size, hyaline, and some have bifurcated or branched necks.|$|E

5000|$|Mucosal melanoma: {{this is also}} <b>a</b> <b>spindled</b> cell {{tumor in}} many cases, but there is pleomorphism, intranuclear {{inclusions}} and prominent nucleoli. The neoplastic cells are usually strongly reactive with S100 protein, SOX10, HMB45, Melan-A, tyrosinase, while negative for SMA, MSA.|$|R

5|$|The {{spore print}} of E.frostii is olive brown. The spores are thick walled, smooth, and spindle shaped, with {{dimensions}} of 11–15 by 4–5µm. Longer spores up to 18µm long {{may also be}} present. The cap cuticle, or pileipellis, is made of a tangled layer of gelatinized hyphae that are 3–6µm wide. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are four spored and measure 26–35 by 10.5–11.5µm. Cystidia are non-fertile cells interspersed among the basidia, and they are prevalent in the hymenial tissue of E.frostii. These hyaline (translucent) cells measure 30–53 long by 7.5–14µm wide, and range in shape from somewhat like <b>a</b> <b>spindle</b> (tapering at each end, but with one end typically rounded) to subampullaceous—shaped somewhat like a swollen bottle.|$|E
5|$|The spores are spherical, and ornamented with warts and ridges {{that form}} a partial {{reticulum}} (a net-like pattern of lines) with prominences up to 2µm high. They are hyaline (translucent), amyloid (meaning they will absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent), and measure 7.5–10.0 by 7–9.5µm. The cap cuticle is a trichoderm. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are 38–56 by 10–13µm, club-shaped, four-spored, and hyaline when mounted in a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH). There are abundant cheilocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} edge of gills), with contents ranging in color from dingy yellow to hyaline in KOH. They measure 32–50 by 3-6µm, and may be shaped somewhat like <b>a</b> <b>spindle</b> (tapered on each end) or a cylinder, or they may be flexuous (winding from side to side). The pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the gill face) are , 2.5–5µm in diameter, and rare to scattered.|$|E
5|$|In a story {{recorded}} {{in the area of}} Cetinje, a zduhać was mortally wounded on Mount Lovćen in a battle against the transmarine zduhaći. The dying zduhać disclosed the way in which he could be saved, and one of his relatives acted according to the instructions. He went by night to a valley where he saw horses, oxen, rams, billy goats, men, and women. He passed by them in total silence, before he saw a black ox. He struck the ox with a wooden bar, and the animal roared tremendously. When he returned home, he found the zduhać sound and healthy. As believed in the region of Birač, eastern Bosnia, a mortally wounded zduhać could get well if he burned beech buds in a milk bucket, and censed himself with the smoke, using <b>a</b> <b>spindle</b> to wave the smoke toward himself. Before performing this rite, he should have publicly confessed that he was a zduhać. Most zduhaći would reputedly rather die than do that, because afterwards they could no more fly as zduhaći. As thought in Herzegovina, a man {{who did not want to}} be a zduhać anymore, should have confessed to a priest and promised that he would not fly anymore.|$|E

25|$|In this mode, the router {{can perform}} tasks similar to <b>a</b> <b>spindle</b> moulder.

25|$|A typical HDD has two {{electric}} motors; <b>a</b> <b>spindle</b> motor that spins {{the disks}} and an actuator (motor) that positions the read/write head assembly across the spinning disks. The disk motor has an external rotor {{attached to the}} disks; the stator windings are fixed in place. Opposite the actuator {{at the end of}} the head support arm is the read-write head; thin printed-circuit cables connect the read-write heads to amplifier electronics mounted at the pivot of the actuator. The head support arm is very light, but also stiff; in modern drives, acceleration at the head reaches 550 g.|$|E
