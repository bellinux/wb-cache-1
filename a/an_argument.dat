40|$|According to Ian Hacking’s Entity Realism, unobservable {{entities}} that scientists carefully manipulate to study other phenomena are real. Although Hacking presents his case in an intuitive, attractive, and persuasive way, his argument remains elusive.

40|$|This study aims to {{describe}} argument structures based on types of complexity and conclusion drawing in students’ academic writing discourse. It employed the qualitative descriptive approach using the communication content analysis method. The data sources were undergraduate theses written by {{students of the}} Department of Tarbiyah, STAIN Manado. The {{results of the study}} are as follows. First, the argument structures based on types of complexity comprise <b>a</b> simple <b>argument</b> structure and <b>a</b> complex <b>argument</b> structure. The complex argument structure consists of <b>an</b> adjacent <b>argument</b> structure and <b>a</b> multi-layer <b>argument</b> structure. Second, the argument structures based on conclusion drawing consist of <b>an</b> inductive <b>argument</b> structure and <b>a</b> deductive <b>argument</b> structure...|$|R

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>argument</b> against herding is that {{juvenile}} remains {{are very}} uncommon at this site, unlike modern cases with herd mortality. They more likely were the periodic victims of flash floods whose carcasses accumulated {{in a lake}} or marshy setting. The Nehden find, however, with its greater span of individual ages, more even mix of Dollodon or Mantellisaurus to Iguanodon bernissartensis, and confined geographic nature, may record mortality of herding animals migrating through rivers.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>argument</b> {{has been}} {{advanced}} that Gediminas had two wives, one pagan and another Orthodox.

Other historians support this claim by arguing this would explain Gediminas' otherwise mysterious designation of a middle son, Jaunutis, as his succession would be understandable if Jaunutis were the first-born son of Gediminas and a second wife.|$|E
5000|$|The musical {{argument}} may {{be characterized}} as the primary flow and current idea being presented in a piece: The very definition of musical argument is something that keeps going, and you uncover new details and new combinations. <b>A</b> musical <b>argument</b> {{is not the same}} as <b>a</b> verbal <b>argument.</b> <b>A</b> verbal <b>argument</b> implies that there's [...] two sides; <b>a</b> musical <b>argument</b> makes the two sides one thing, like counterpoint. A fugue is like that; a double fugue, at least, takes two different ideasand shows you how they relate, and it shows you how they're the same thing. Phil Lesh (1982) Thus one may hear of <b>a</b> musical <b>argument</b> being interrupted, extended, or repeated.|$|R
