During the period 1900 - 2000, subsidence created approximately 2. 5 billion cubic meters of anthropogenic <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> in the Delta.

An <b>Accommodation</b> <b>Space</b> Index, which relates subaqueous <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> to anthropogenic <b>accommodation</b> <b>space,</b> provides an indicator of past and projected Delta conditions. While subsidence and sea level rise create increasing anthropogenic <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> in the Delta, they also lead to a regional increase in the forces that can cause levee failure. Although these forces take many forms, a Levee Force Index can be calculated that is a proxy for the cumulative forces acting on levees. The Levee Force Index increases significantly over the next 50 years demonstrating regional increases in the potential for island flooding. Based on continuing increases in the Levee Force Index and the <b>Accommodation</b> <b>Space</b> Index, and limited support for Delta levee upgrades, there will be a tendency for increases in and impacts of island flooding, with escalating costs for repairs. Additionally, there is a two-in-three chance that 100 -year recurrence interval floods or earthquakes will cause catastrophic flooding and significant change in the Delta by 2050.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to test the hypothesis that post-rift development of ponded <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> – a type of salt-induced <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> – exerted a controlling factor on the characteristics and distribution of the post-Oligocene lithofacies deposited in parts of the Kwanza and Lower Congo Basins (Angolan margin) covered by this study. The tectonostratigraphic evolution of the area covered by the 3 D reflection seismic survey suggests that, during the Early Miocene, the study area was subject to extensional salt deformation. A landward shift of the salt deformation domains occurred during Mid Miocene to Early Pliocene times. This shift in salt domains was coeval with deposition of lithofacies which have characteristics that resemble those deposited in ponded-basin and healed slope salt-induced <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> in the Gulf of Mexico. Lithofacies characteristic of deposition in healed slope <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> dominate the Mid Miocene to Early Pliocene sedimentary packages, and suggest that ponded <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> constituted less than 20 % of the total accommodation available at the time of deposition. Seafloor profiles across the present day Angolan margin and central Gulf of Mexico suggest that partial bypass of the slope during deposition in healed slope <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> may result in large abyssal plain sediment accumulation. This substantial abyssal plain sedimentation may have buttressed the toe of the Angola Salt Nappe hindering its advance and therefore promoting the landward shift in salt deformation domains observed during this period. Thus, the analysis of the sedimentary packages deposited in the study area during the post-Oligocene to Recent suggests that healed slope <b>accommodation</b> <b>space,</b> rather than ponded accommodation, provided the dominant control on the characteristics and distribution of the lithofacies and consequent shifts in salt deformation domains along the Angolan margin.

40|$|Abstract: The {{variation}} of <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> in faulted basin is mainly affected by three factors: the differential sub-sidence of basement, the deposition of sediments and the {{variation of}} absolute lake level. In this article, the variation laws of <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> have been analyzed and its distribution characteristics have been explained when the lake level is descending, still and ascending and the deposition and subsidence {{are taken into}} account. And at the same time, the exis-tence conditions of transformational belt and its planimetric positions can be figured out with analyses above. Accommo-dation space changes both through time and basin, as a see-saw movement, which is called <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> trans-formation. The characteristics of <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> and its products constitute the accommodation transformation sys-tem. Transformation surface and body are basic elements of the accommodation transformation system. The accommoda-tion transformation system {{can be divided into}} several grades according to originating mechanism and product character-istics.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{interpolation}} model that describes Holocene groundwater level rise {{and the creation}} of <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> in 3 D in the Rhine-Meuse delta – the Netherlands. The model area (ca. 12 400 km 2) covers two palaeovalleys of Late Pleistocene age (each 30 km wide) and the overlying Holocene deposits of the Rhine-Meuse delta, the Holland coastal plain, and the Zuiderzee former lagoon. Water table rise is modelled from 10 800 to 1000 cal. BP, making use of age-depth relations based on 384 basal peat index points, and producing output in the form of stacked palaeo groundwater surfaces, groundwater age-depth curves, and voxel sets. These products allow to resolve (i) regional change and variations of inland water table slopes, (ii) spatial differences in the timing and pacing of transgression, and (iii) analysis of interplay of coastal, fluvial and subsidence controls on the provision of <b>accommodation</b> <b>space.</b> The interpolation model is a multi-parameter trend function, to which a 3 D-kriging procedure of the residuals is added. This split design deploys a generic approach for modelling provision of <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> in deltas and coastal lowlands, aiming to work both in areas of intermediate data availability and in the most data-rich environments. Major provision of <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> occurred from 8500 cal BP onwards, but a different evolution occurred in each of the two palaeovalleys. In the northern valley, creation of <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> began to stall at 7500 cal BP, while in the southern valley provision of new <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> in considerable quantities continued longer. The latter is due to the floodplain gradient that was maintained by the Rhine, which distinguishes the fluvial deltaic environment {{from the rest of the}} back-barrier coastal plain. The interpolation results allow advanced mapping and investigation of apparent spatial differences in Holocene aggradation in larger coastal sedimentary systems. Furthermore, they provide a means to generate first-order age information with centennial precision for 3 D geological subsurface models of Holocene deltas and valley fills. As such, the interpolation is of use in studies into past and present land subsidence and into low land sedimentation...|$|R
25|$|Places where {{large-scale}} sedimentation {{takes place}} are called sedimentary basins. The amount of sediment {{that can be}} deposited in a basin depends on {{the depth of the}} basin, the so-called <b>accommodation</b> <b>space.</b> The depth, shape and size of a basin depend on tectonics, movements within the Earth's lithosphere. Where the lithosphere moves upward (tectonic uplift), land eventually rises above sea level, so that and erosion removes material, and the area becomes a source for new sediment.

When the lithosphere keeps subsiding, new <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> keeps being created.|$|R

50|$|The adding {{of weight}} by {{sedimentation}} from erosion or orogenic processes, or loading, causes crustal depression and subsidence.

50|$|Successful rifting {{creates a}} {{spreading}} center like a mid-ocean ridge, which moves progressively further from coastlines as oceanic lithosphere is produced.
