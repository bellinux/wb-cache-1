40|$|Tar (heavy {{hydrocarbon}} or poly {{aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH)) removal from biomass derived fuel gas {{is one of}} the biggest obstacles in its utilization for power generation. We have investigated pulsed corona as a method <b>for</b> <b>tar</b> removal. Our previous experimental results indicate the energy consumption of 400 J/L for naphthalene removal (model tar compound) from synthetic fuel gas (CO, CO 2, H 2, CH 4, N 2) at a temperature of 200 °C. The present study extends our work on experimental and kinetic calculations for temperatures up to 500 °C. Radical yields are evaluated at various temperatures. According to the kinetic model and experimental results we concluded that the optimum temperature <b>for</b> <b>tar</b> removal is around 400 °C. The energy consumption <b>for</b> <b>tar</b> removal at 400 °C is about 200 - 250 J/L, whereas at 200 °C, this is about 400 - 600 J/L...|$|R
