5|$|The {{authors of}} a 2002 {{article about the}} spinosaur Irritator {{proposed}} that Suchomimus tenerensis was similar enough to B. walkeri {{to be considered a}} species within the same genus (B. tenerensis), and suggested that Suchomimus was identical to Cristatusaurus; both are from the Elrhaz Formation of Niger. At about 9.5m (30ft) and 2.5 tonnes (5,511lb), Suchomimus was larger than Baryonyx. In a 2004 conference abstract, palaeontologists Steve Hutt <b>and</b> <b>Penny</b> Newbery supported this view based on a large theropod vertebra from the Isle of Wight which they attributed to Baryonyx; this indicated that the vertebrae of the two genera were more similar than previously thought. Later studies have kept the genera separate.|$|E
