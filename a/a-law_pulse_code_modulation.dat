30|$|Speech coding is {{a process}} to {{transform}} a digitized speech signal into a bit-efficient representation that keeps reasonable speech quality so as to facilitate speech transmission over a band-limited channel or speech storage in a memory-limited media. In general, speech coding techniques can be classified into three categories, including waveform coding, parametric coding, and hybrid coding. The waveform coding technique attempts to maintain the waveform shape of the original speech signal in sample level without any knowledge about the speech generation process. Famous standard speech coders of this category are G. 711 <b>A-law</b> and μ-law <b>Pulse</b> <b>Code</b> <b>Modulation</b> (PCM) coders [1], and G. 726 and G. 727 Adaptive Differential PCM coders [2]. Generally, a waveform coder works well at a high bit rate of 32  kbps or above. The parametric coding technique represents a speech signal by parameters of a speech-generating model. Among various speech-generating models, the most successful one is the linear predictive coding (LPC) model that assumes speech signal is the output of an all-pole model (autoregressive model) fed with an excitation input signal. The parameters of the all-pole filter conceptually represent the vocal tract shape that is highly correlated with the spectral envelope of the speech, while the excitation signal uses a quasiperiodic impulse train to represent information of fundamental frequency (or F 0) for voiced speech, pseudorandom noise for unvoiced speech, {{or a combination of}} the two (i.e., mixed excitation). Coders of this type encode speech signal in a frame-based processing manner and could operate at low bit rates ranging from 2 to 5  kbps. Differing from waveform coders, parametric coders make no attempt to preserve the original waveform shape but to keep the perceptual quality of the reconstructed speech. Famous standard LPC-based speech coders are FS 1015 LPC of LPC- 10 e algorithm [3, 4] and MELP (mixed excitation linear prediction) [5]. The hybrid coding technique tries to combine the advantages of both waveform coding and parametric coding. Coders of this type are similar to parametric coders in utilizing speech-generating models, but also similar to waveform coders in keeping encoded speech waveforms close to the original ones by more detailed modeling of the excitation signal. They generally adopt the code-excited linear prediction (CELP) algorithm [6] to minimize perceptually weighted error. Representative standard hybrid coders are FS 1016 CELP [7, 8], ITU-T G. 728 LD-CELP [9], ETSI AMR-ACELP [10], etc. A hybrid coder generally operates at a medium bit rate of 5 to 15  kbps.|$|R

We present a novel low-complexity scheme for adaptive differential <b>pulse</b> <b>code</b> <b>modulation</b> of color video using a set of two-level quantizers which are switched adaptively on a block-by-block basis. The quantizers are designed by statistical optimization with a new design criterion that borrows from DPCM, block truncation coding (BTC) and vector quantization (VQ). Coding results show that our scheme has a better performance than other lowcomplexity schemes. At 2 bit/pixel, it performs more than 2. 0 dB better in peak signal-to-noise ratio than DPCM and up to 3. 5 dB better than BTC. Possible applications include VLSI implementations and real-time compression for video transmission over local area networks. 1.
