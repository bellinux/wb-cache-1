Some of the profits were invested in the production of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. [...] Engineer Alan Parsons received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical for The Dark Side of the Moon, and he went on to have a successful career as a recording artist with the Alan Parsons Project. [...] Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the {{success of the}} album, Mason has praised his role. [...] In 2003, Parsons reflected: [...] "I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on Dark Side of the Moon, which has an element of truth to it. [...] But I still wake up occasionally, frustrated about the fact that they made untold millions and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> involved in the record didn't." ...|$|E

However, she had another project in mind – {{developing}} the screenplay for the Andrew Sean Greer novel, The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells. Madonna decided to split her time between writing the screenplay and writing songs for the new album. In February 2014, Madonna confirmed that she had already begun working on her thirteenth studio album, saying: [...] "I'm {{right now in the}} process of talking to various co-writers and producers and talking about where I want to go with my music". Working with a number of collaborators on the album, Madonna encountered problems in keeping a cohesive sound and creative direction for Rebel Heart, since her previous efforts had been produced with only a small core group of people developing the music. She observed that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> she enlisted would not stay in one city at a time due to their different projects, resulting in Madonna not finishing her songs. [...] "So, I was just the person standing there with a clipboard in the headlights, going 'Ok!' A little bit like a school teacher," [...] she admitted.|$|E

As the series progresses, John struggles with his feelings for Cameron, who is a Terminator. Dekker was cast after Headey secured the role of Sarah Connor. Regarding the Terminator films, Dekker says [...] "They are like my favorite films when I was younger. So it's very ironic that I'm getting to do this. And I know for the younger generation and for myself, John was equally important to me as Sarah was, and I know <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> that I hear from really, really care about John".

2500|$|Frontman James Veck-Gilodi {{has spoken}} {{at length about}} the themes of each song on the album, {{describing}} them as 'very personal and each is a small story that depicts {{a part of my}} life'. Much of the album is about nostalgia, underachievement and anxiety, which are all topics which are personal to him as he wrote all the lyrics for the album. The opening track [...] "The Past Six Years", from whose lyrics the album takes its title, is described as 'an ode to... not really achieving as much as we'd have liked'. The lyrics make reference to friends and fellow bands Lower Than Atlantis and Young Guns and how James feels 'a perpetual bitterness and jealousy towards them in terms of their achievements, {{despite the fact that they}} are close friends'. [...] "I'm a Bore, Mostly" [...] also deals with the topic of underachievement, with James explaining that the song is about 'the mundane daily routine I had when I was living in London. ...I couldn't deal with city life, I rarely left the house and found myself sinking into this terrible routine. I didn't really appreciate anything at the time and I had no enthusiasm'. He has claimed he wrote the song [...] "Filthy Rotten Scoundrel" [...] about himself; 'I need to learn to be grateful and appreciate the opportunities that I have been given. It's also about my fear of living, dying and never really achieving anything'. [...] "The World or Nothing" [...] continues this trend, with James describing the theme as 'the vicious cycle of feeling lost and resorting to the aid of alcohol while also feeling lost because of alcohol. It talks about how self-destructive a lot of us are and how we enjoy abusing our bodies'. Of [...] "Nelson's County", Veck-Gilodi has said: 'This song is about the county of Norfolk and how <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who reside there seem to have no real ambition other than working a 9-5, raising a family and living a normal life'.|$|E

Some of the mean looking young men at this boarding house have christened him [...] "The Emperor"--which seems a strange thing for them to have picked upon, and they draw him out in his talk, and when they meet him they make mock salutes to him which Uncle returns with very great dignity.
