5|$|A {{prerequisite}} for natural selection {{to result in}} adaptive evolution, novel traits and speciation {{is the presence of}} heritable genetic variation that results in fitness differences. Genetic variation is the result of mutations, genetic recombinations and alterations in the karyotype (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes). Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are rare. In the past, most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution. However, many mutations in non-coding DNA have deleterious effects. Although both mutation rates <b>and</b> <b>average</b> fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism, a majority of mutations in humans are slightly deleterious.|$|E

The study also concluded that expansion of biofuel production was not a relevant factor and also {{that there is no}} correlation between Brazilian sugarcane cultivated area <b>and</b> <b>average</b> grain prices, as on the contrary, the spread of sugarcane was accompanied by rapid growth of grain crops in the country.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to England, Hirst completed another double in 1904.

In August, Hirst had a benefit match against Lancashire from which he received £3,703, worth around £296,000 in 2009, a very high sum for a benefit at the time, and his popularity was reflected in the attendance over three days of 78,792 spectators.|$|E
