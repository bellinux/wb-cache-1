5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as <b>a</b> <b>shrewd</b> thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|E
5|$|Both {{supporters}} and critics of Cheney regard him as <b>a</b> <b>shrewd</b> and knowledgeable politician {{who knows the}} functions and intricacies of the federal government. A sign of Cheney's active policy-making role was then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert's provision of an office near the House floor for Cheney {{in addition to his}} office in the West Wing, his ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building, and his Senate offices (one in the Dirksen Senate Office Building and another off the floor of the Senate).|$|E

50|$|The New York Times {{attributed}} the victory to Slotnick’s “clever courtroom tactics,” {{noting that he}} “turned out to be <b>a</b> <b>shrewder,</b> more accomplished performer than the prosecutor, Gregory Waples.” In particular, Slotnick’s aggressive questioning of James Ramseur, {{one of the four}} shot by Goetz, caused Ramseur to react explosively, which resulted in Ramseur’s entire testimony being stricken from the record including negative statements Ramseur made about Goetz.|$|R

5|$|In {{the summers}} of 1843 and 1844 Słowacki {{traveled}} to Pornic, a resort on the Atlantic coast in Brittany. It was there, in 1844, {{that he wrote}} Genezis z Ducha (Genesis from the Spirit). This work introduced his own philosophical system {{that would have a}} visible influence on his works in his last decade. Around 1839 Słowacki put his capital into the Parisian stock market. He was <b>a</b> <b>shrewd</b> investor who earned enough from the investments to dedicate his life to his literary career; he was also able to pay the costs of having his books published.|$|E
5|$|A {{radical change}} of tactics, which {{involved}} {{the introduction of}} a bill to ban British subjects from aiding or participating in the slave trade to the French colonies, was suggested by maritime lawyer James Stephen. It was <b>a</b> <b>shrewd</b> move, since the majority of British ships were now flying American flags and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom Britain was at war. A bill was introduced and approved by the cabinet, and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self-imposed silence, so as not to draw any attention to the effect of the bill. The approach proved successful, and the new Foreign Slave Trade Bill was quickly passed, and received royal assent on 23 May 1806.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Dave Russell {{joined the}} club from Bury who were, at the time, two {{divisions}} above Tranmere. Considered <b>a</b> <b>shrewd</b> businessman, Russell made some revolutionary changes. He developed a successful youth policy which included England international Roy McFarland among its graduates. More visibly, he introduced an all-white kit {{to set the}} team apart from local rivals, Division One club Everton; these have been Tranmere's usual colours since. He also {{took advantage of the}} floodlights, regularly arranging home fixtures on Friday evenings rather than the usual Saturday afternoon. This allowed supporters to watch Tranmere on Fridays and Everton or Liverpool on Saturdays; Friday night games continued until the 1990s. Russell guided Rovers back to Division Three in 1967, a year before a new 4,000-seater main stand was opened. He became general manager in 1969, allowing Jackie Wright to take over.|$|E

5|$|Lander's Peak was an {{immediate}} success; twelve hundred people were invited for the exhibition, and almost a thousand showed up. Bierstadt was <b>a</b> <b>shrewd</b> self-promoter {{as well as a}} gifted artist, and this was the first of his paintings to be widely promoted with a single-picture exhibition, accompanied by a pamphlet, engravings and a tour. The painting, with its ten-foot width, was intended both for exhibition halls and the homes of America's emergent millionaire class. In 1865 it was purchased by British railway entrepreneur James McHenry for the (at the time) high price of $25,000. Bierstadt later bought it back, and gave or sold it to his brother Edward, before it was eventually acquired for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1907.|$|E
5|$|Van Alen was {{respected}} {{in his field}} for {{his work at the}} Albemarle building at Broadway and 24th Street, designed in collaboration with his partner H. Craig Severance. Van Alen and Severance complemented each other, with Van Alen being an original, imaginative architect and Severance being <b>a</b> <b>shrewd</b> businessperson who handled the firm's finances. However, the relationship between them became tense because of their disagreements on how best to run the firm. The breaking point came after a 1924 article in the Architectural Review that praised the building's design, giving attribution to Van Alen while ignoring Severance's role altogether; their association dissolved months later. This ended up being decisive for the design of the future Chrysler Building, since Severance had a more traditional architectural style and Van Alen had a more modern style.|$|E
5|$|Waddington {{relied upon}} experience; Dennis Viollet, Jackie Mudie, Roy Vernon, Maurice Setters and Jimmy McIlroy were players signed {{in the later}} stages of their careers. Matthews was awarded a knighthood for {{services}} to football in the 1965 New Year's Honours list. This was followed by his final, league appearance for the club against Fulham in February 1965, shortly after his 50th birthday. It ended a career spanning 33 years, including 19 years' service to his home town club. Gordon Banks, England's 1966 World Cup winning goalkeeper, joined Stoke from Leicester in 1967 for £52,000. Regarded as the best goalkeeper in the world, Banks proved to be <b>a</b> <b>shrewd</b> signing for Waddington as he helped the club maintain stability in the First Division. However, Banks was forced to quit top-level football in 1972, after losing an eye in a road accident.|$|E

Nanaline was <b>a</b> <b>shrewd</b> businesswoman, often {{compared}} to Hetty Green, and when she died in 1962, she left her daughter, then estimated to be worth $250 million, a fortune triple what J. B. had left her.|$|E
25|$|The Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant {{has been}} highly {{regarded}} {{by the general}} public, military historians and literary critics. Grant was <b>a</b> <b>shrewd,</b> intelligent, and effective writer. He portrayed himself in the persona of the honorable Western hero, whose strength lies in his honesty and straightforwardness. He candidly depicts his battles against both the external Confederates and internal Army foes.|$|E
25|$|The {{apparently}} genial Moríñigo quickly {{proved himself}} <b>a</b> <b>shrewd</b> politician with {{a mind of}} his own, and Liberal ministers resigned on September 30, when they realized {{that they could not}} impose their will on him. Having inherited Estigarribia's near-dictatorial powers provided by the new 1940 Constitution, Moríñigo quickly banned febreristas and Liberals and clamped down drastically on free speech and individual liberties.|$|E

25|$|When Jack Lynch, the Taoiseach and friend, {{announced}} his retirement, and future rise owed to Haughey, Aiken refused to serve. Haughey was <b>a</b> <b>shrewd,</b> but corruptible campaigner: running {{a gang of}} 500 businessmen out of Gresham's Hotel, Dublin {{to raise funds for}} his cause. Haughey's support for the Provisional IRA's bombing war was eventually exposed as in defiance of Aiken's warnings and persistent advice.|$|E
25|$|Columbo is <b>a</b> <b>shrewd</b> but inelegant blue-collar {{homicide}} detective whose trademarks include his shambling manner and frequently disheveled appearance. He is consistently underestimated by his often affluent suspects who, initially reassured and distracted by his circumstantial speech, become increasingly unsettled by his pestering behavior. Despite his apparent absentmindedness, Columbo’s formidable eye for detail and relentless approach {{lead him to}} secure evidence and solve his cases.|$|E
25|$|Amenhotep III's {{refusal to}} allow {{one of his}} daughters {{to be married to}} the Babylonian monarch may indeed be {{connected}} with Egyptian traditional royal practices that could provide a claim upon the throne through marriage to a royal princess, or, it could be viewed as <b>a</b> <b>shrewd</b> attempt on his part to enhance Egypt's prestige over those of her neighbours in the international world.|$|E

25|$|Bolte was a {{rough-hewn}} {{politician who}} liked {{to be seen as}} a simple farmer, but he had <b>a</b> <b>shrewd</b> political mind. He rapidly consolidated himself in power, helped by the expelled faction of the Labor Party, the Democratic Labor Party, which directed its second preferences to the Liberals at elections. His populist attacks on the trade unions, intellectuals, protesters and the press won him a large following.|$|E

25|$|Max Pirkis (Season 1 {{and early}} 2) and Simon Woods (Season 2) as Gaius Octavian – Portrayed as <b>a</b> <b>shrewd,</b> if {{somewhat}} cold, young man, {{with a limited}} understanding of the world, people, philosophy and politics. Despite this, he is very power hungry, a failure as a military strategist and uses the accomplishments of his relatives {{as a means to}} further his political career. The basis for this character is the early life of Augustus, the first Roman Emperor.|$|E
