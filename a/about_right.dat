He already had a strong defence, with five psychiatrists firmly behind him as well as George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary, who had agreed to testify on his behalf. The lawyer considered the boy's probable reaction to a cross-examination by the prosecution in court. Lamb appeared calm and collected on the surface, and had so far answered questions <b>about</b> <b>right</b> and wrong in a somewhat rational way. Although the doctors had been able to see Lamb's answers for what they really were, Nosanchuk feared that Lamb's appearance could actually lead the jury to believe that he was sane, which might lead to a guilty verdict and the gallows. He therefore did not call Lamb to the stand.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Harrison of The New Republic {{believes}} that the writers deliberately broke up any main character who was approaching a borderline life-changing relationship because [...] "The ones the Friends were really meant to be with were, after all, the other Friends". Because Monica and Joey were initially conceived as the show's two most sexual characters, Crane and Kauffman had originally intended {{for them to be}} the show's main couple, before ultimately replacing them with Ross and Rachel. The idea of Monica and Joey was abandoned once the role of Joey was cast; actor Matt LeBlanc approached his character using much more of a [...] "big brother vibe" [...] in terms of Joey's relationship with Cox's character as opposed to a romantic one, which the writers ultimately preferred. According to Allison Piwowarski of Bustle, Monica and Joey's relationship would have greatly altered the trajectory of the entire series, having life-changing effects on its characters. Summarizing the role of Monica in the series, Martin Gitlin wrote in his book The Greatest Sitcoms of All Time that while her friends [...] "were ... just out {{to make the most of}} their social lives", Monica [...] "sought to keep the others in line" [...] while searching for [...] "Mr. Right", who surprisingly turns out to be close friend Chandler. Several years before Monica and Chandler became romantically involved, Cox once joked in an interview that if her character were to ever have sex with another main character, it would most likely be Chandler. Crane and Kauffman had never intended to pair off Monica and Chandler with each other, and only decided to expand upon the idea of a relationship between the two friends upon realizing that viewers had [...] "fallen in love" [...] with the notion of Monica and Chandler as a couple. According to Robert Bianco of USA Today, [...] "Their affair came out of the blue and was supposed to quickly return there — but something in the relationship clicked with viewers." [...] The idea of Monica and Chandler's romantic arc originally surfaced much earlier in the series from writers Scott Silveri and Shana Goldberg-Meehan, who first observed the characters' chemistry in the season two episode [...] "The One Where Ross Finds Out", in which an idle and unemployed Monica is temporarily acting as Chandler's personal trainer. However, Silveri's suggestion was initially vetoed by the other writers, who felt that it was simply too soon to introduce another main couple to Friends having just recently paired off Ross and Rachel. Following Ross and Rachel's break up in season three, the writers felt that the timing was just <b>about</b> <b>right</b> to officially introduce Monica and Chandler as a couple, deciding that Friends [...] "can't simply rest on this one [...] relationship", while believing that Monica and Chandler's would ultimately provide a fun opportunity for the writers to explore brand new storylines.|$|E

40|$|Cosmopolitanism at the {{international}} level—the recognition of an international human rights regime—has been much defended of late. Little attention has been paid, however, to the federalist analogue: should there be insistence on a national rights regime? Or should variation in the recognition of rights be tolerated at the subnational level, as a nec-essary concession to moral disagreement, {{as an effort to}} contain problematic experiments, or as a way to generate progress <b>about</b> <b>rights?</b> This article argues that subnational variation in the recognition of rights represents a second-best {{solution to the problem of}} deep moral disagreement <b>about</b> <b>rights.</b> However, federalism provides a second-best solution only on the condition that citizens are able to move from one subnational jurisdiction to another. To the extent that citizens are able to move to rights regimes that are more favorable to them, intranational variation in the recognition of rights may have advantages over international variation, where national borders may pose barriers to migration. However, in the United States, despite the privileges and immunities of national citizenship, there remain impressive legal barriers to such mobility in the case of contested rights. Given these barriers, federalism as it exists in the United States today does not fully realize the advantages of a second-best solution to deep moral disagreements <b>about</b> <b>rights...</b>|$|R
