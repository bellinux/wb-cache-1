The mitogenic effect of ATG was not abrogated by monocyte depletion indicating that like CD 2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) ATG activate T cells via a monocyte-independent pathway. CD 3 and CD 2 mAbs which activate T cells without binding to B surface determinants stimulated the proliferation of B cells and their differentiation into immunoglobulin (Ig) -secreting cells. In contrast, ATG induced only a transient B cell activation, but failed to support B cell differentiation into Ig-secreting cells despite the secretion of IL- 2.

40|$|In {{this series}} of papers {{it has been shown}} that the immune {{response}} of mice to sheep erythrocytes requires the participation of two classes of lymphoid cells. Thymus-derived cells initially react with antigen and then interact with another class of cells, the antibody-forming cell precursors, to cause their differentiation to antibody-forming cells. <b>Antilymphocyte</b> <b>globulin</b> depressed the ability of mice to respond to sheep erythrocytes. This effect was more marked when the antigen was injected intraperitoneally than intravenously, and occurred only when the <b>antilymphocyte</b> <b>globulin</b> was given before or simultaneously with antigen. Injection of thymus cells restored to near normal the ability to respond to an intravenous injection of sheep erythrocytes. Spleen cells from antilymphocyte globulin-treated mice gave a weak adoptive immune response in irradiated recipients. The addition of thymus cells however enabled a response similar to that given by normal spleen cells. When thymectomized irradiated recipients were used, normal spleen cells continued to give a higher response to a challenge of sheep erythrocytes at 2 and 4 wk postirradiation than did spleen cells from ALG-treated donors. This result is more consistent with the notion that thymus-derived target cells are eliminated, rather than temporarily inactivated, by <b>antilymphocyte</b> <b>globulin.</b> These findings suggest that, in vivo, <b>antilymphocyte</b> <b>globulin</b> acts selectively on the thymus-derived antigen-reactive cells...|$|E

40|$|CD 4 +CD 28 − T {{cells are}} a unique type of proinflammatory T cells characterised by {{blockade}} of costimulatory CD 28 receptor expression at the transcriptional level, {{which is still}} reversible by IL- 12. In healthy individuals older than 65 years, these cells may accumulate to up to 50 % of total CD 4 + T lymphocytes as in many immune-mediated diseases, immunodeficiency, and specific infectious diseases. Here we focus on CD 4 +CD 28 − T cells in chronic immune-mediated diseases, summarizing various phenotypic and functional characteristics, which {{vary depending on the}} underlying disease, disease activity, and concurrent treatment. CD 4 +CD 28 − T cells present as effector/memory cells with increased replicative history and oligoclonality but reduced apoptosis.

40|$|Introduction It has {{recently}} been proposed to replace the current Eurotransplant kidney allocation based primarily on mismatches (MM) at the 3 HLA loci by a simpler system based on full HLA-DR compatibility. The present study analyzes this system in the current era of immunosuppression. Methods From 1999 to 2012, 723 renal grafts were performed on 586 patients who were treated with a calcineurin inhibitor, mycophenolate mofetil, {{and in most cases}} <b>antilymphocyte</b> <b>globulins.</b> Four groups of HLA MM were compared: (A) A+B 2 - 4 /DR 1 - 2 MM (n = 397), (B) A+B 2 - 4 MM/DR 0 MM (n = 106), (C) A+B 0 - 1 MM/DR 1 - 2 MM (n = 138), and (D) A+B 0 - 1 /DR 0 MM (n = 82). Results Acute rejection episodes were less frequent during the first post-transplantation year in group D than in the other groups (P =. 018). Patient survival was lower in group A than in the other groups (P =. 008). Immunologic graft survival was higher in group D than in the other groups in univariate (P =. 015) and multivariate analyses (P =. 033; 96. 4 % vs 90. 1 % at 10 years). Conclusions In the current era of immunosuppression, allocation of kidneys from deceased donors could be performed primarily according to full DR compatibility then to the best A+B matching, affording excellent graft outcome to most recipients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pro-inflammatory, {{cytotoxic}} CD 4 (+) CD 28 (-) T-cells {{with known}} defects in apoptosis {{have been investigated}} as markers of premature immuno-senescence in various immune-mediated diseases. In this study we evaluated the influence of polyclonal <b>antilymphocyte</b> <b>globulins</b> (ATG-Fresenius, ATG-F) on CD 4 (+) CD 28 (-) T-cells in vivo and in vitro. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Surface and intracellular three colour fluorescence activated cell sorting analyses of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} from 16 consecutive transplant recipients and short-term cell lines were performed. In vivo, peripheral levels of CD 3 (+) CD 4 (+) CD 28 (-) T-cells decreased from 3. 7 ± 7. 1 % before to 0 ± 0 % six hours after ATG-F application (P = 0. 043) in 5 ATG-F treated but not in 11 control patients (2. 9 ± 2. 9 % vs. 3. 9 ± 3. 0 %). In vitro, ATG-F induced apoptosis even in CD 4 (+) CD 28 (-) T-cells, which was 4. 3 -times higher than in CD 4 (+) CD 28 (+) T-cells. ATG-F evoked apoptosis was partially reversed by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) -Val-Ala-Asp(OMe) -fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) and prednisolon- 21 -hydrogensuccinate. ATG-F triggered CD 25 expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and induced down-regulation of the type 1 chemokine receptors CXCR- 3, CCR- 5, CX 3 CR- 1 and the central memory adhesion molecule CD 62 L predominately in CD 4 (+) CD 28 (-) T-cells. CONCLUSION: In summary, in vivo depletion of peripheral CD 3 (+) CD 4 (+) CD 28 (-) T-cells by ATG-F in transplant recipients was paralleled in vitro by ATG-F induced apoptosis. CD 25 expression and chemokine receptor down-regulation in CD 4 (+) CD 28 (-) T-cells only partly explain the underlying mechanism...|$|R
40|$|From May to August 1989 15 cadaver-donor renal {{transplant}} recipients {{were treated}} for 14 days with LO-Tact- 1 (10 mg i. v. per day) {{in combination with}} cyclosporin (8 mg/kg/day from day - 1), low-dose steroids (1 / 2 mg/kg/day from day 1, then reduced to 0. 25 mg/kg at day 26 and 10 mg/day at day 45), and azathioprine (1 mg/kg/day) started at day 45. LO-Tact- 1 is a rat monoclonal antibody which is directed to the interleukin- 2 receptor. The control group consisted of 20 patients receiving cyclosporin, high-dose steroids (2 mg/day at day 1) and a 14 -day course of polyclonal horse <b>antilymphocyte</b> <b>globulins</b> (ALG). Seven patients experienced 9 rejections during the first 3 months post-transplant between day 10 and day 67 (mean 0. 6 per patient), comparable to the incidence of rejections in the control group: 8 rejections in 7 patients (mean 0. 4 per patient). All rejections were reversed by steroid boluses and ATG. To date, all study patients have functioning grafts, and at 1 -year post-transplant, the mean blood creatinine level is 161. 2 -mu-mol/l. In the control group, one patient died of CMV infection, and 2 other grafts failed due to rejection. No adverse effect of antibody administration was observed, and hematological changes remained of minor importance. Viral infections were not observed, except one case of herpes simplex. Comparatively, clinical CMV infections occurred in 3 patients receiving ALG (15 percent). Our data suggest that a combination anti-IL- 2 monoclonal antibody, cyclosporin and low-dose steroids can safely be administered to allograft recipients, avoid severe viral infections, and, in our early experience, is as potent as the powerful combination ALG, cyclosporin and high-doses steroids in preventing allograft rejection...|$|R

Although there are numerous reports of autoimmune disease after treatment with ALG in aplastic anaemia, and GBS after immunosuppressive treatment, there are none reporting GBS after the use of ALG for severe aplastic anaemia. The occurrence of autoimmune disease after immunosuppressive treatment, in particular ALG, is discussed, together with the possible mechanisms that result from T cell depression...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the case of}} a HBsAg+, HBeAg+ carrier, treated with lamivudine, who experienced exacerbation of hepatitis after BMT from an anti-HBs+, anti-HBc+, anti-HBe+ donor. The serological profile of the donor and the timing of exacerbation suggested that the adoptive immunity transfer played a major pathogenetic role. <b>Antilymphocyte</b> <b>globulin</b> administration resulted in resolution of hepatitis and seroconversion to anti-HBs+. Therapy aimed at blocking the effector arm of liver damage could represent a novel approach to avoid the risk of progression to fulminant hepatitis without hampering the chances of recovery from hepatitis B...|$|E
40|$|Treatment {{of severe}} aplastic anemia with <b>antilymphocyte</b> <b>globulin,</b> {{cyclosporine}} and two different {{granulocyte colony-stimulating factor}} regimens: a GITMO prospective randomized study Acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a rare disease, defined as peripher-al blood pancytopenia associated with hypocellularity of the bone marrow. 1 In most cases, bone marrow failure is thought to result from an immune-mediated mech-anism which leads to T-cell activation and release of inhibitory cytokines with subse-quent destruction of hematopoietic pro-genitor cells. 2 Immunosuppression is the treatment of choice in older patients with a relatively high neutrophil count, 3 as wel...|$|E
40|$|Variations in the {{distribution}} of 51 Cr-labelled human lymphocytes from several donors and from one donor on several occasions have been determined after their injection into carbon-treated mice and reasons for the variation discussed. Natural alteration of the lymphocyte surface (leukaemic lymphocytes) or induced change (trypsin-treatment) reduced lymph node localisation as did treatment with formalin, sodium azide and <b>antilymphocyte</b> <b>globulin.</b> We have concluded that the presence of radioactivity in the lymph nodes is due to the presence of viable, metabolically active lymphocytes with normal surfaces capable of interacting with the endothelium of the post-capillary venules...|$|E
