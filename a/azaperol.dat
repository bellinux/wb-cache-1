40|$|A {{procedure}} {{was developed for}} determination of 5 sedatives and 14 &# 946;-blockers in swine kidney and subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Three different procedures for extraction were tested, evaluated through recovery studies. The procedure using acetonitrile for extraction and cleanup with freezing at low temperature and dispersive solid phase extraction using 500 mg celite® 545 before the concentration step presented the better results. The dried samples were redissolved with methanol and analyzed using a LC-MS/MS system with electrospray ionization (ESI) operating in positive MRM mode. The recovery values for this procedure were in the 75 - 88 % range. The robustness of the method was tested against small variations. The method was used to analyze carazolol, azaperone and <b>azaperol</b> in collaborative assay, obtaining results close to designed value...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{robustness}} {{of the sample}} preparation procedure for the determination of six tranquilizers (xylazine, azaperone, propionylpromazine, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, and <b>azaperol)</b> and a beta-blocker (carazolol) in animal muscle by LC/MS–MS was assessed through the experimental design methodology. A 2 III 7 − 4 fractional factorial design was performed to evaluate the influence of seven variables on the final concentration of the seven drugs in the samples, in accordance with what is laid down in Commission Decision No 2002 / 657 /EC. The variation considered for each of those seven factors {{is likely to happen}} when preparing the samples, being the values chosen as level − 1, the nominal operating conditions. The results of the experimentation were evaluated from different statistical strategies, such as hypothesis testing using an external variance previously estimated, Lenth's method, and Bayesian analysis. Both Lenth's and Bayes' approaches enabled to determine the effect of every variable even though no degrees of freedom were left to estimate the residual error. The same conclusion about {{the robustness}} of the extraction step was reached from the three methodologies, namely, none of the seven factors examined influenced on the method performance significantly, so the sample preparation procedure was considered to be robust.
