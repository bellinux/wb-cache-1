30|$|While British {{case law}} {{provides}} enough legal material {{to draw the}} line between an employee and a self-employed person, there are few decisions on the distinction between a dependent “worker” and <b>an</b> independent <b>self-employed</b> <b>person</b> (Burchell et al. 1999). Legal definitions of employment status differ across legislation fields. The employment status of a dependent self-employed worker may be defined one way in employment protection legislation, another for tax purposes, and still another in social security legislation. The consequence of such differences could result in a worker neither profiting from (potential) tax advantages for the self-employed, nor qualifying for employment protection from unfair dismissal, nor being eligible for redundancy compensation, statutory sick pay, or statutory maternity pay (Burchell et al. 1999; Freedman and Chamberlain 1997).|$|R
40|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1986 {{introduced}} a new tax subsidy for health insurance purchases by the self-employed. We analyze the changing patterns of insurance demand before and after tax reform to generate new estimates of how the after-tax price of insurance affects the discrete choice of whether to buy insurance. We employ both traditional regression models and difference-in-difference methods that compare changes in insurance coverage across groups around TRA 86.

40|$|The {{ratio of}} {{business}} units per inhabitant {{is one of}} the most important factors that determine the development of economies and regions, because it has a strong impact on competition, employment and innovation. In East Germany, where the process of catching up has decelerated since the mid-nineties, the findings on this topic are ambivalent: on the one hand, half <b>a</b> million <b>self-employed</b> <b>persons</b> are counted and a similar number of companies are registered by the regional Chambers of Industry and Commerce. Furthermore, about 157. 000 companies engaged in handicraft exist. These figures can be regarded as a success compared to the beginning of the nineties at the outset of systemic transformation. On the other hand, a striking entrepreneurial gap in East Germany still exists compared to the situation in the western part. It seems that this gap will not be closed in the near future, even on the contrary: the number of newly registered business units in East Germany has declined. Against this background, the promotion of entrepreneurship will remain a great challenge on the political agenda. ...|$|R

It is also possible for someone to form a business that is run only part-time or concurrently while holding down a full-time job. This form of employment, while popular, does come with several legal responsibilities. When working from home, clearance may sometimes be required from the local authority to use part of the home as business premises. Should the self-employed person hold records of customers or suppliers in any electronic form they will be required to register with the Information Commissioner's Office. Other legal responsibilities include statutory public liability insurance cover, modifying premises to be disabled-friendly, and the proper recording and accounting of financial transactions.

5000|$|The {{types of}} {{coverage}} available to small employers {{are similar to}} those offered by large firms, but small businesses {{do not have the same}} options for financing their benefit plans.

[...] A RAND Corporation study published in April 2008 found that the cost of health care coverage places a greater burden on small firms, as a percentage of payroll, than on larger firms. [...] A study published by the American Enterprise Institute in August 2008 examined the effect of state benefit mandates on self-employed individuals, and found that [...] "the larger the number of mandates in a state, the lower the probability that <b>a</b> <b>self-employed</b> <b>person</b> will be a significant employment generator."
