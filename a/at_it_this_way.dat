Three of Cartwright's early novels feature a character named Timothy Curtiz, named partly for Kurtz from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, and partly for Cartwright's own brother. In Interior, Curtiz is in Africa investigating the disappearance of his father in 1959 while on a trip for National Geographic. In Look <b>At</b> <b>It</b> <b>This</b> <b>Way,</b> Curtiz {{is a columnist for}} Manhattan magazine while he is living in London, has a daughter named Gemma, {{and by the end of}} the novel has a partner named Victoria.

[...] Heller went on to say, [...] "What you get from that scene is what you should get. The viewer is supposed to be convinced. Patrick Jane is certain it's Red John... Thing is, Red John is a master of the mind game. If Red John wanted to die, maybe this is how he wanted to die. Or maybe he just wants Jane to think he's dead."

40|$|Images of {{patients}} in a modernising society: The Netherlands, 1880 - 1920 In this essay {{it is argued that}} advertisements for medicines in the lay press constitute an important source for the patient in medical history. At first sight, advertisements only seem to document the supply side of the medical market. However, the image of the proactive manufacturer offering his goods to passive consumers is a misleading one. For a manufacturer to get and remain in business, it was crucial to develop a sensitive antenna for the needs of the public. In a highly commercial domain like health care around 1900 production, distribution and consumption of medicines constituted an interactive cycle of which advertisements were a part. They mirror a subtle play with dormant notions about health, illness and healing. When looking <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> the health care system (or rather: the medical market) becomes a place where meaning is being constructed, negotiated and exchanged. Thus, by taking a closer look at advertisements, the demand side comes in sight as well. By using advertisements for medicines in the lay press as a source, it seems possible to overcome the objection that much patient history is still too much focused on the academy and on physicians...|$|E
2500|$|To {{resolve the}} issue, Article 100 was {{inserted}} into the Constitution to enable the President {{to refer to the}} Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal any question as to the effect of any constitutional provision. President Ong Teng Cheong then referred to the Tribunal, which [...] consisted of three Supreme Court judges, the issue of whether he had the power under Article 22H(1) to withhold assent to any bill seeking to amend any of the provisions referred to in Article 5(2A), and specifically to any bill seeking to amend Article 22H to restrict the application of the President's powers under that Article to non-constitutional bills. In a judgment delivered on 20 April 1995, the Tribunal held that even though Article 5(2A) was not in force, the Government's intent in including it as part of the Constitution had to be considered. Looking <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>it</b> was clear that Article 5(2A) was intended to deal with bills seeking to amend the Constitution, while Article 22H covered only ordinary bills. Therefore, the President had no power under Article 22H to withhold his assent to any bill seeking to amend the Constitution, and in particular any of the provisions referred to Article 5(2A).|$|R

40|$|D. Litt. et Phil. The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the idea of "life" after death in the Old Testament - particularly two wisdom psalms (49 and 73). The hypothesis used was that "life" after death in the Old Testament, and in Psalms 49 and 73 in particular. Looking <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> "life" after death is actually a continuation of the former (mundane) relationship. "Life" after death according to Psalms 49 and 73 is therefore not to be understood in the sense of the New Testament's risen, transfigured body, but rather as a "continued relationship" (Chapter I). This study warns against a retrospective introduction of New Testament ideas or dogmas into the Old Testament. Should this happen the New Testament is made to be normative for the interpretation of the Old Testament. In short: because Psalms 49 and 73 do not mention a bodily resurrection, it does not mean that they have nothing to say about "life" after death. The viewpoint is therefore that Psalms 49 and 73 must be allowed to speak for themselves in a contemporary idiom. In order to do this as objectively as possible these psalms were investigated text immanently, including a discourse analysis of each psalm (Chapter 2). At least two cardinal aspects transpired during this research, namely the use of the verb. Using the above as direction indicators the idea of "life" (community) after death - as well as matters related to this. (Chapter 4). It was concluded that the New Testament credo of immortality, eternal life and a risen, transfigured body, was the culmination of a long process of development which went on for centuries. The poets of Psalms 49 and 73 apply two traditions. The expression nine can be seen as the second cornerstone of Psalms 49 and 73. Research (Chapter 5) shows how nine in these psalms does not indicate "animals" in general, but should rather be translated here as a noun, namely "hippopotamus". In the first-mentioned deity (god) chaos, evil and divine-hostile powers are embodied. The second deity (goddess) was the symbol of self-exaltation, pride and fertility (i. e. the ability to eternalise or sustain oneself regardless of death) ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the opening}} of the last of these remarks there is much justice. So there is in the {{striking}} suggestion made in another place, that we should not bless erroneous systems for their utility, simply because they help to repair some small part of the mischief of which they have themselves been the principal cause.[61] But on the whole it is obvious that Condorcet was unfitted by his temper, and that of the school to which he most belonged, from accepting religion as a fact {{in the history of the}} human mind that must have some positive explanation. To look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in <b>this</b> <b>way</b> as the creation of a handful of selfish impostors in each community, was to show a radical incompetence to carry out the scheme which had been so scientifically projected. The picture is ruined by the angry caricature of what ought to have been one of the most important figures in <b>it.</b> To <b>this</b> place the Christian Church is undeniably entitled, however we may be disposed to strike the balance between the undoubted injuries and the undoubted advantages which it has been the means of dealing to the civilisation of the west. Never perhaps was there so thorough an inversion of the true view of the comparative elevation of different parts of human character, as is implied in Condorcet's strange hint that Cromwell's satellites would have been much better men if they had carried instead of the Bible at their saddle-bows some merry book of the stamp of Voltaire's Pucelle.[62] ...|$|R
40|$|Citation: Sears, Fred C. Families {{of plants}} most useful to man. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1892. Introduction: In any {{discussion}} {{as to the}} comparative value to man of the various families of plants, our estimate {{must be based on}} the nature of the wants which they supply and on the number and quality of the substitutes which are available in case they did not exist. Basing, then, our estimation of these things it is evident that those plants are most valuable which supply man with food, since a supply of food is one of the primary conditions for man’s existence. Anything else man may do without, if we except air and water, but cut of man’s food supply and he is of very little use. Looking <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in <b>this</b> <b>way</b> I consider that there is no family which has a better claim to the first place than Gramineae. It numbers among its representatives plants which grow in every country, temperate or tropical and the failure of the crop of a single representative may be sufficient to cause famine throughout an entire country. Wheat, Triticum vulgare, is probably the most universally used of any single plant food and when we consider the immense number of people with whom it is a staple article of diet, if not the staff of life; the quantity of it which is raised; and the number of people who make their whole, or at least a large part of their living by producing it for other people’s use, it might seem that this one species was sufficient to place this family in the front rank at least, if not at the very head...|$|R
40|$|The Mesoproterozoic (1600 – 1000 Ma) is an Era of Earth {{history that}} has been defined in the {{literature}} as being quiescent {{in terms of both}} tectonics and the evolution of the biosphere and atmosphere (Holland, 2006, Piper, 2013 b and Young, 2013). The ‘boring billion’ is an informal term that is given to a time period overlapping the Mesoproterozoic period, extending from 1. 85 to 0. 85 Ga (Holland, 2006). Orogenesis was not absent from this period however, with various continents featuring active accretionary orogenesis along their margins for the entire Mesoproterozoic (see Condie, 2013 and Roberts, 2013), and others featuring major continental collisional orogenesis that relates to the formation of the supercontinent Rodinia {{towards the end of the}} Mesoproterozoic. Looking <b>at</b> <b>it</b> another <b>way,</b> <b>this</b> period followed the formation of perhaps the first long-lived supercontinent, Columbia (a. k. a. Nuna), and then it prepared the ground for the momentous geological and biological events in the Neoproterozoic that paved the way for the Cambrian explosion of life. As such it is a very important period of Earth history to understand better. Do orogens formed in the Mesoproterozoic differ from those formed in the recent past, or those formed in early Earth history, and if so in what way? Do orogens in the Mesoproterozoic have distinct structural, metamorphic or magmatic characteristics? How are Mesoproterozoic orogens related geodynamically and kinematically? These are overarching questions that this collection of sixteen research papers aims to address. This introduction presents a brief discussion of the contribution of these papers to these questions and topics. ...|$|R
