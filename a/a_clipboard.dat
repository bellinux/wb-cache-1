However, she had another project in mind – {{developing}} the screenplay for the Andrew Sean Greer novel, The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells. Madonna decided to split her time between writing the screenplay and writing songs for the new album. In February 2014, Madonna confirmed that she had already begun working on her thirteenth studio album, saying: [...] "I'm {{right now in the}} process of talking to various co-writers and producers and talking about where I want to go with my music". Working with a number of collaborators on the album, Madonna encountered problems in keeping a cohesive sound and creative direction for Rebel Heart, since her previous efforts had been produced with only a small core group of people developing the music. She observed that a lot of the people she enlisted would not stay in one city at a time due to their different projects, resulting in Madonna not finishing her songs.

500|$|Mardas {{gave the}} Beatles regular reports of his progress, {{but when they}} {{required}} their new studio in January 1969, during the Get Back project that became Let It Be, they discovered an unusable studio: no 72-track tape deck (Mardas had reduced it to 16 tracks), no soundproofing, no talkback (intercom) system, and not even a patch bay to run the wiring between the control room and the 16 speakers that Mardas had fixed haphazardly to the walls. The only new piece of sound equipment present was a crude mixing console which Mardas had built, which looked (in the words of Martin's assistant, Dave Harries) like [...] "bits of wood and an old oscilloscope". The console was scrapped after just one session. Harrison said it was [...] "chaos", {{and that they had}} to [...] "rip it all out and start again," [...] calling it [...] "the biggest disaster of all time." [...] Harrison's suspicions of Mardas' competence had been raised when he saw him wandering around in a white coat with <b>a</b> <b>clipboard,</b> and considered the possibility that Mardas had [...] "just read the latest version of Science Weekly, and used its ideas". Mardas later stated that he had never been in the basement of Savile Row, as the studio equipment he was building was being tested in Apple Electronics, at Boston Place, Marylebone.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the first}} semi-final, representatives for Azerbaijan {{complained to the}} EBU over the {{introductory}} [...] "postcard" [...] preceding the Armenian entry, since the video clip had included a depiction of We Are Our Mountains, a monumental statue located in the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh republic, which {{is considered to be}} a de jure part of Azerbaijan.

40|$|Four {{studies show}} that the {{abstract}} concept of importance is grounded in bodily experiences of weight. Participants provided judgments of importance while they held either a heavy or <b>a</b> light <b>clipboard.</b> Holding <b>a</b> heavy <b>clipboard</b> increased judgments of monetary value (Study 1) and made participants consider fair decision-making procedures to be more important (Study 2). It also caused more elaborate thinking, as indicated by higher consistency between related judgments (Study 3) and by greater polarization of agreement ratings for strong versus weak arguments (Study 4). In line with an embodied perspective on cognition, these findings suggest that, much as weight makes people invest more physical effort in dealing with concrete objects, it also makes people invest more cognitive effort in dealing with abstract issues...|$|R
