25|$|Enríquez {{pursued the}} rights to become the Royal Guinea Company sole {{representative}} in Puerto Rico. Established in 1701, this entity served as a major slave trader and became the only one sanctioned by the Spanish Crown {{to do business in}} their American colonies. On May 16, 1710, he officially completed this goal, signing a loan contract with the company's general director, Juan Bautista Chouirrio. With this accord, Enríquez became a major slaver in the territories of Puerto Rico, Trinidad, Margarita, Cumaná, Cumanagoto and Maracaibo, also permitting the adquisicion of slaves from adjacent islands such as Jamaica, St. Thomas and Curaçao depending on convenience. Under this agreement, he was able to import 40 African slaves per year, which he could sale under his own criteria. The contract lasted for three years and it also provided exemptions for clothes and maintenance. With the liberty to purchase these from any port in the Caribbean without right charges, it is likely that this was further exploited to import products at cheap prices, providing a large margin of profit. For every peça sold, Enríquez paid 100 pieces of eight, which were combined with an additional fee of 4,000 per year. Danío was involved in the transaction (which would also prove convenient for him as an official of the company) and along the other parts, an accord to secure that wins and losses were divided on three equal parts between them. Enríquez was jubilous with this development and proposed public celebration to commemorate it. He held the contract for a period of four years, leading 19 voyages under the premise of acquiring slaves and maintenance for them. Most of them were destined to St. Thomas. However, only ten of these incursions returned with new slaves for a total of 96, the others were used to import 109 barrels of flour. This cereal was supposedly bought to feed his slaves, but instead it was sold to the wealthier classes for profit. It is presumed that other odd products acquired under this premise, such as wine, beer, sugar, aguardiente, cocoa, paper and even copper, were sold in similar fashion. His enemies were quick to publicly denounce this practice, albeit with some exaggeration. Years later, these rights were supplanted despite the protests of Enríquez. In 1713, the Royal Guinea Company lost its status and was instead replaced with the Royal Asiento of Great Britain. Enríquez immediately pursued a position within this new entity and quickly coordinated moves with some friends, Santiago Gibbens in St. Thomas and Felipe Henríquez in Curaçao, to establish a new business model once he acquired these rights. To further secure the success of this venture, Enríquez offered gifts and even stakes to people that were already involved with the company. In June 1718, <b>attorney</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> Tomás Othey granted him the title of factor and completed a loan contract. Enríquez was only able to employ this office until September, experiencing a series of complications based on international politics. During this timeframe, Othey himself imported slaves through the South Sea Company.|$|E

The devastation caused by both Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 certainly falls within this category. Professor Colbert uses these events as a backdrop to examine the legal profession’s ethical obligation when crisis compromises the most basic elements of our system of justice. Acknowledging that numerous members of the bar and thousands of volunteer law students courageously stepped forward in those challenging times to assist the many people denied basic aspects of justice, Professor Colbert examines in a more fundamental way why relatively few <b>attorneys</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> volunteered, as well as the broader responsibilities of the legal profession during such crisis. Tracing the century-old evolution of lawyers’ ethical codes, Professor Colbert reflects upon whether the legal profession takes seriously an attorney’s core value of public service. He challenges the bar to examine and to appreciate in a deeper way what the Model Rules’ Preamble declares in its’ opening sentence as the lawyer’s role “as a public citizen having special responsibility for the quality of justice. ” Professor Colbert’s review of the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina and the September 11 th attacks suggests that the “learned profession” has considerable distance to travel before it satisfies Model Rule’s 6. 1, pro bono duty “to provide legal services to those unable to pay. ” To cite just one example, he highlights the bar’s limited response to the Katrina crisis by noting that the sole criminal courthouse in New Orleans remained closed for ten months and thereby denied access to most incarcerated people awaiting trial. Professor Colbert’s article poses the fundamental question that every bar association and legal educator must answer. Are we doing enough to instill public service as a core requirement of preparing people to practice law and to meet their professional responsibility when disaster overwhelms our very system of justice...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the ruling}} of the Supreme Court affirmed the earlier {{decision}} of the appellate court in favor of Marina Stengart, there was an important difference in the decisions by the two courts. This difference between the Supreme Court and the Appellate Court was in how each court decided where the case would go next.

The Supreme Court, however, decided to modify the appellate court’s judgment by requiring that the case be remanded back to the trial court for a decision as to what sanctions, if any, should be imposed on Loving Care’s counsel.|$|R
40|$|Criminal defense {{attorneys}} are often motivated by an intricate set {{of moral and}} ideological principles that belie their reputations as amoral (if not immoral) “hired guns” who {{would do anything to}} get their guilty clients off. Using empirical data from interviews with forty criminal {{defense attorneys}} I explore the motivations that inform their decisions to enter the field of criminal defense and the values that influence {{the manner in which they}} do their jobs. I conclude that many criminal defense <b>attorneys</b> are <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> cause lawyers who are committed to individual clients but also the “cause” of legal reform in criminal law. These dual commitment [...] essentially to individual clients versus the collective group of criminal defendants [...] occasionally raise ethical conflicts that have largely gone under-examined and that the rules of ethics and professionalism are not well-equipped to resolve. Although examined here through the lens of criminal defending, the ethical dilemma of cause lawyering is a noteworthy problem generally for activist lawyers because they continue to play an important role in socio-legal movements in this country...|$|R

5000|$|As the {{preparation}} of legal documents {{becomes more and more}} computerized, the function of non-attorney document preparers has become less dependent upon the preparers individual skills, and more upon the quality of their software. By the same token, the continued increase of the availability of document software, legal aid websites, and the like, make it more and more likely that persons with some level of computer skills will be able to prepare and file legal documents without <b>attorneys,</b> and <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> may not need even the limited assistance offered by LDAs, to prepare competent and quality legal documents. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>in</b> the late 1990s, the Texas Bar Association, recognizing the threat that this trend represents to the pocketbooks of lawyers, sued Nolo Press, the countrys leading publisher of self-help books and software, for alleging that Nolo was guilty of practicing law without a license.

When Steffy finds out that Wyatt had betrayed her trust and that their marriage was based on the lie of Liam's disappearance, Steffy filed for divorce, and returned to Liam. A few weeks before the divorce was due to be finalised, Quinn suggested to Eric that Steffy should be made CEO of Forrester Creations, to which he agrees. Wyatt and Steffy realise that this was part of Quinn's scheme to reunite them, and Wyatt agreed to fast-track the divorce as a result.|$|R

60|$|The silence which {{occurred}} after {{we took our}} seats must have lasted several minutes. For myself, I saw I was only a secondary person in this interview; old Andries having completely supplanted me in importance, not only in acts, but in the estimation of the squatters.

The man who measured land, and he who took it to himself without measurement, were exactly antagonist forces, in morals as well as in physics; and might be supposed not to regard each other with the most friendly eyes.

As for the old man himself, I could see that he looked very Dutch, which implied a stubborn resolution bordering on obstinacy; unmoved adherence to what he conceived to be right; and a strong dislike to his present neighbors, in addition to other reasons, on account of their having come from the eastward; a race that he both distrusted and respected; disliked, yet covertly honored, for many a quality that was both useful and good.|$|E
