30|$|In general, we have {{to render}} an <b>artificial</b> <b>aerial</b> {{perspective}} effect on a target object to emulate the natural atmospheric effect. This goal is specially more difficult in real-time applications in outdoor scenes, which present a challenge due to the variant illumination and atmospheric conditions such as clear, hazy, or cloudy days.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an attempt in 2008 {{to establish an}} aerial census of adult chum salmon using a small radio-controlled (RC) helicopter. The Moheji River, located in southern Hokkaido, was chosen because all the salmon in a stretch of the river between a weir and the estuary are seine-netted every morning for <b>artificial</b> propagation. <b>Aerial</b> photographs of the river were taken from a RC helicopter equipped with a digital single-lens reflex camera and polarized filter. To quantify salmon density within the census area, the number of salmon per aerial photograph was counted using image-processing software. Salmon could be clearly identified in photographs taken from an altitude of âˆ¼ 30 m. Salmon numbers estimated by aerial census and seine-netting were significantly related. The results indicate that a small RC helicopter {{can be used to}} generate adult salmon abundance data in Japanese rivers...|$|R
40|$|The best {{technical}} {{package for}} the future comprises trypanocidal drugs for temporary relief {{and the use of}} insecticide-treated cattle, <b>artificial</b> baits and <b>aerial</b> spraying to attack the vector, to so give more lasting security. Whether this can speed the previously slow progress will depend on overcoming past hindrances to tsetse control : sporadic support, disputes over its desirability, difficulties of sustaining international operations, and poor planning in some instances. The Pan-African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Campaign intends to speed the progress but will fail unless it improves its image by breaking its association with the sterile insect technique and quickly executing some cheap and effective operations in large areas. Even then, there could be severe brakes due to Africa's political and financial instability. Overall, the pace of control is likely to increase, but perhaps only a little. </span...|$|R
40|$|The Sardinia Aperture Array Demonstrator (SAD) is an Italian project {{aimed at}} {{developing}} new {{technology in the}} area of Low-Frequency Aperture Arrays (LFAAs). The final objective of SAD is to test technologies and demonstrate concepts for a possible application in the LFAA instrument of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). In LFAA, the electronically steered beam produced by a large number of antenna elements makes the digital signal processing extremely challenging. In this framework, the electromagnetic aspects of these large arrays are significant and an accurate analysis is mandatory. For instance in SAD, a lot of efforts have been addressed to design the antenna, to analyse its electromagnetic performance, to measure the antenna patterns by using an <b>aerial</b> <b>artificial</b> probe, to analyse the array behaviour and to set up an automatic procedure for monitoring the radio spectrum at the site. All these aspects are discussed in this articl...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, aerial {{vehicles}} {{have allowed}} exploring scenarios with harsh conditions. These can conduct reconnaissance tasks {{in areas that}} change periodically and have a high spatial and temporal resolution. The objective of a reconnaissance task is to survey an area and retrieve strategic information. The aerial vehicles, however, have inherent constraints in terms of energy and transmission range due to their mobility. Despite these constraints, the Data Foraging problem requires the aerial vehicles to exchange information about profitable data sources. In Data Foraging, establishing a single path is not viable because of dynamic conditions of the environment. Thus, reconnaissance must be focused on periodically searching profitable environmental data sources, as some animals perform foraging. In this work, a data-foraging-oriented reconnaissance algorithm based on bio-inspired indirect communication for aerial vehicles is presented. The approach establishes several paths that overlap to identify valuable data sources. Inspired by the stigmergy principle, the aerial vehicles indirectly communicate through <b>artificial</b> pheromones. The <b>aerial</b> vehicles traverse the environment using a heuristic algorithm that uses the artificial pheromones as feedback. The solution is formally defined and mathematically evaluated. In addition, we show {{the viability of the}} algorithm by simulations which have been tested through various statistical hypothesis...|$|R
