5|$|Proposed in {{the form}} of an interstate compact, the {{agreement}} would go into effect among the participating states in the compact only after they collectively represent an absolute majority of votes (currently at least 270) in the Electoral College. In the next presidential election after adoption by the requisite number of states, the participating states would award all of their electoral votes to presidential electors associated with the candidate who wins the overall popular vote in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a result, the winner of the national popular vote would <b>always</b> <b>win</b> the presidency by always securing a majority of votes in the Electoral College. Until the compact's conditions are met, all states award electoral votes in their current manner.|$|E
5|$|Moreno González {{was born}} in the ranchería of Guanajuatillo in Apatzingán, Michoacán, Mexico at around 5:00a.m. on 8 March 1970. There are few details of Moreno González's upbringing, but {{religion}} may have {{played an important role in}} his early life. His parents had 13 children (including Moreno González). His father Manuel Moreno was reportedly an alcoholic and had several mistresses, and one day he left his family when Moreno González was still very young, forcing his mother to singlehandedly raise the whole family. With their father gone, Moreno González and his siblings lived under the strict discipline of their mother. According to his autobiography, Moreno González had a love-hate relationship with his mother; as a child, he was beaten by his mother for being troublesome and getting into fights. In one occasion, he recalled that his mother once forced him to make his way back to his house by walking on his knees while keeping his arms stretched like a cross throughout the whole day for stealing an animal. Such treatments helped him develop resentment as to partially explain his violent behavior as an adult, he argued. He admitted, however, that he often got into fist fights with other kids from Guanajuatillo and the surrounding rancherías. Moreno González recalled that he would not <b>always</b> <b>win</b> and that he once got into 10 fights in a single day. His violent reputation as a child helped him earn the nickname El Más Loco ("The Craziest One")—which he held onto for the rest of his life—among his siblings and other kids from the area where he grew up.|$|E

25|$|Bullying {{behaviours}} in {{the workplace}} also exist among colleagues. They can be either the ‘target’ or perpetrator. If workplace bullying happens among the co-workers, witnesses will take sides, either with the target or the perpetrator. Perpetrators <b>always</b> <b>win,</b> because witnesses {{do not want to}} be the next target. This does encourage perpetrators to continue this behaviour. In addition, the sense of the injustice experienced by a target might lead that person to become another perpetrator who bullies other colleagues who have less power than they.|$|E
25|$|The points {{classification}} is {{the third}} oldest of the four jersey current awarding classifications in the Giro d'Italia. It {{was introduced in the}} 1966 Giro d'Italia and was first won by Gianni Motta. Points are given to the rider who is first to reach the end of, or determined places during, any stage of the Giro. The red jersey is worn by the rider who at the start of each stage, has the largest amount of points. The rider whom {{at the end of the}} Giro, holds the most points, wins the points competition. Each stage win, regardless of the stage's categorization, awards 25 points, second place is worth 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point less per place down the line, to a single point for fifteenth. This means that a true sprinter might not <b>always</b> <b>win</b> the points classification. The classification was added to draw the participation of the sprinters. The classification has been won four times by two riders: Francesco Moser and Giuseppe Saronni. The 2013 winner of the classification was Mark Cavendish.|$|E

Throughout the 1830s, he continued to tour the United States, exhibiting the machine as far west as the Mississippi River and visiting Canada. In Richmond, Virginia, the Turk was observed by Edgar Allan Poe, who was writing for the Southern Literary Messenger. Poe's essay [...] "Maelzel's Chess Player" [...] was published in April 1836 and is the most famous essay on the Turk, {{even though many of}} Poe's hypotheses were incorrect (such as that a chess-playing machine must <b>always</b> <b>win).</b>|$|E
500|$|Friday {{was known}} for giving his all in any game in which he played, no matter the circumstances.

[...] This strong drive to <b>always</b> <b>win</b> even extended {{to the use of}} physical intimidation to unsettle opposing players, leading contemporary critics to label him a [...] "villain". Friday also employed the use of psychological tactics; aiming to spook opposing players, Friday would kiss them or fondle their testicles. Cardiff teammate Paul Went recalled that these tricks would [...] "completely [...] " [...] defenders and affect their concentration. [...] Although he was often criticised for the number of bookings and sendings-off he received, Friday believed he was justified to chase victory by any means, explaining his attitude in a 1977 interview: [...] "On the pitch I hate all opponents. I don't give a damn about anyone. People think I'm mad, a lunatic. I am a winner".|$|E

500|$|After Guy Lombardo's {{death in}} 1977, CBS and the Royal Canadians {{attempted}} {{to continue their}} New Year's Eve broadcasts from the Waldorf-Astoria for 1977–78. However, the effects of Lombardo's absence led {{to a decline in}} viewership, allowing New Year's Rockin' Eve to overtake the Royal Canadians in viewership in only its fifth year on-air. The threat of the new special also prompted CBS to drop the Royal Canadians entirely in 1979 in favor of a new special, Happy New Year, America, which premiered for New Year's Eve 1979–80. With its recent success, Clark began hoping that New Year's Rockin' Eve would become a television tradition of its own, lamenting that [...] "Lombardo would <b>always</b> <b>win</b> [...] because of the Waldorf and 35 years of tradition, but we finally got it wrested." [...] Clark's hopes soon became reality, as New Year's Rockin' Eve had displaced Guy Lombardo as the most popular and most-watched New Year's Eve special on American television in the years following.|$|E
500|$|Matsoukas {{initially}} {{planned the}} music video to visualize Beyoncé winning the contest, {{where she would}} {{realize that it was}} meaningless to her. However, Beyoncé suggested that an albino should serve as the contest's winner instead. Speaking to MTV News, Matsoukas elaborated: [...] "We thought it was really important and interesting to break those ideas of what the classic beauty standards would be and to do this with this beautiful albino woman, I thought was really great. And to show 'Yeah she's not perfect, she doesn't <b>always</b> <b>win</b> and you put your best foot forward and you may still lose.'" [...] The video's ending was originally intended to depict archival footage of American actresses Halle Berry and Vanessa A. Williams, to promote beauty for African-American women. However, Beyoncé sent a note to Matsoukas suggesting that footage from her childhood should be interpolated {{at the end of the}} song in order to connect it to the second music video from the album, [...] "Ghost".|$|E
500|$|According to Ubisoft, [...] "teamwork, tactics, and tension" [...] {{were the}} game's three most {{important}} pillars. The team initially worked on a respawn feature, allowing players to rejoin after they are killed in the game. However, following several internal tournaments, the team realized {{that some of their}} employees would <b>always</b> <b>win</b> a match. They concluded that the respawn system worked to the benefit of strong players and placed individual skill above teamwork, which did not fit the developer's focus on game tactics. Removing the respawn feature meant greater consequences for taking risks, and players had to rely on their teammates in order to survive and achieve objectives. According to Chris Lee, the game's designer, the team initially worried that the system would only appeal to hardcore players. However, after several testings, they found that the removal of the respawn system provided new challenges to strong players and forced them to cooperate with their teammates – while it rewarded weaker players who were willing to take their time, plan their actions, and be strategic.|$|E

500|$|In {{polygynous}} species, males {{will try}} to monopolize and mate with multiple females. As with monogamy, polygyny in rodents can come in two forms; defense and non-defense. Defense polygyny involves males controlling territories that contain resources that attract females. This occurs in ground squirrels like yellow-bellied marmots, California ground squirrels, Columbian ground squirrels and Richardson's ground squirrels. Males with territories are known as [...] "resident" [...] males and the females that live within the territories are known as [...] "resident" [...] females. In the case of marmots, resident males {{do not appear to}} ever lose their territories and <b>always</b> <b>win</b> encounters with invading males. Some species are also known to directly defend their resident females and the ensuing fights can lead to severe wounding. In species with non-defense polygyny, males are not territorial and wander widely in search of females to monopolize. These males establish dominance hierarchies, with the high-ranking males having access to the most females. This occurs in species like Belding's ground squirrels and some tree squirrel species.|$|E

[...] He {{went on to say that}} Styles and Daniels [...] "were great in the final minutes at conveying sheer exhaustion mixed with desire to win" [...] and that they [...] "had a tough act to follow with the stunt filled Monsters Ball." [...] As for the Monster's Ball match, Keller said it was a [...] "good one" [...] but it was [...] "tough to go to four stars for a match that includes so many huge spots and little long-term selling, but it's also hard not to rate it this high when there's a potential [...] "big spot of the year" [...] and a crowd chanting [...] "That was awesome!"
