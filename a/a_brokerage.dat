50|$|<b>A</b> {{discount}} <b>brokerage</b> is <b>a</b> {{business that}} charges clients significantly lower fees than <b>a</b> traditional <b>brokerage</b> firm but without providing financial advice.

25|$|Because ETFs {{trade on}} an exchange, each {{transaction}} is generally subject to <b>a</b> <b>brokerage</b> commission. Commissions {{depend on the}} brokerage and which plan is chosen by the customer. For example, a typical flat fee schedule from an online brokerage firm in the United States ranges from $10 to $20, {{but it can be}} as low as $0 with discount brokers. Due to this commission cost, the amount invested has a great bearing; someone who wishes to invest $100 per month may have a significant percentage of their investment destroyed immediately, while for someone making a $200,000 investment, the commission cost may be negligible. Generally, mutual funds obtained directly from the fund company itself do not charge <b>a</b> <b>brokerage</b> fee. Thus, when low or no-cost transactions are available, ETFs become very competitive.|$|E

25|$|Banks in the United States offer {{savings and}} money market deposit accounts, but {{these should not}} be {{confused}} with money mutual funds.

The Court held unanimously that the strong pro-arbitration policy it had found in the FAA in Moses Cone required that split.|$|E

In a lawsuit, Eliot Spitzer, then New York State’s attorney general, accused Marsh of not serving as an unbiased broker, leading to increased costs for clients and higher fees for Marsh. In early 2005, Marsh agreed to pay $850 million to settle the lawsuit and compensate clients whose commercial insurance it arranged from 2001 to 2004.|$|E

25|$|Woodhull twice {{went from}} rags to riches, her first fortune being {{made on the}} road as a {{magnetic}} healer before she joined the spiritualist movement in the 1870s. While authorship of many of her articles is disputed (many of her speeches on these topics were collaborations between Woodhull, her backers, and her second husband, Colonel James Blood), {{her role as a}} representative of these movements was powerful. Together with her sister, Tennessee Claflin, she was the first woman to operate <b>a</b> <b>brokerage</b> firm on Wall Street; they were among the first women to found a newspaper in the United States, Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly, which began publication in 1870.|$|E

The activists admitted to detonating a device containing two litres of fuel and four pounds of explosives on the doorstep of Blackburn's home. In 2006 the ALF warned that it was targeting HLS suppliers, and that year firebombed a car belonging to the finance director of Canaccord Capital, <b>a</b> <b>brokerage</b> firm. Members of SHAC said the company had acted as brokers for Phytopharm, which had used HLS for contract testing.|$|E

25|$|As Premier, Rae {{placed a}} cap on {{enrollment}} into medical schools. The Rae government also delisted home care from OHIP coverage but introduced a new comprehensive program to deliver the service mostly on a non-profit basis by publicly run, regional multi-service agencies and passed the Home Care and Community Services Act, 1994 to facilitate this. The Harris government subsequently rejected this model for <b>a</b> <b>brokerage</b> model in which Community Care Access Centres would hire a home care provider to service a region rather than provide the service directly and lifted the 10% limit {{on the use of}} for-profit service delivery that the Rae government had imposed.|$|E
25|$|A {{currency}} transaction tax {{is a tax}} {{placed on}} {{a specific type of}} currency transaction for a specific purpose. This term has been most commonly associated with the financial sector, as opposed to consumption taxes paid by consumers. The most frequently discussed versions of a currency transaction tax are the Tobin tax, Edgar L. Feige's Automated Payment Transaction tax and Spahn tax. The Automated Payment Transaction tax requires that all transactions be taxed regardless of the means of payment. As such, it proposes a unique tax on currency transactions collected at the time currency leaves or enters the banking system. Since each transaction mediated by currency can not be directly taxed, the APT tax proposes <b>a</b> <b>brokerage</b> fee on currency deposits and withdrawals that is some multiple of the flat transaction tax rate applied to all payments made via electronic payments mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Webb {{was born}} in Detroit in 1905 and grew up there and in a Quaker {{community}} in Ontario. From 19241929 {{he worked as a}} bank teller and clerk at <b>a</b> <b>brokerage</b> firm in Detroit; in another account, he was a successful stockbroker during the 1920s but lost his earnings during the Crash before the Depression. During the Depression beginning in 1929, he moved to California and worked as a prospector and earned a meager living. During these years he also worked as a fire ranger for the United States Forestry Service. Webb reportedly wrote short stories which were unpublished. After 1934, Webb returned to Detroit and worked for the automobile manufacturer Chrysler in their export division. In 1937, he visited a friend in Panama in search of gold, but had little success. But in Panama, he brought along a camera donated by his former employer, Chrysler.|$|E
