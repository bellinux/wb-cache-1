40|$|We {{recorded}} resting {{and breeding}} sites {{used by the}} endangered European mink (Mustela lutreola) inhabiting Western Europe (Foral Community of Navarre). Over a sample size of 22 radio-tracked mink (10 adult females, 7 adult males, 2 young females, and 3 young males) between March 2007 and February 2009, we found that European mink mainly rested within brambles and reeds (39. 7 % for each type, n= 156), regardless of seasons and age-sex classes. On average, the resting site re-use rate was 1. 3 (range= 1 – 4. 3). Nine out of 10 breeding dens were located in lagoons or tributaries. The only one located along a main river course lost the litter due to flooding. Eight out of 10 breeding dens were in bramble patches. Thick and helophytic vegetation should be prioritised in management plans aimed at improving the conservation status of this species. Promoting this vegetation would favour <b>adequate</b> <b>resting</b> and breeding sites for European mink. A focus on improving vegetation around lagoons or tributaries can help to minimise flooding during the breeding period. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Thirty-nine Limousine bulls supplied by one farm located near to Saragoza (Spain) were examined after 5 consignments at the final destination, fol-lowing a journey of 2, 550 km to the “San Giorgio ” abattoir (Palermo, Italy).

As regards the blood cell counts, data showed a significant effect (P< 0. 001) of the lairage duration on leukocyte and platelet counts.

500|$|Sleeper berth time is {{any amount}} of time spent inside the sleeper berth (e.g., resting or sleeping). FMCSA {{regulation}} §393.76 gives the minimum requirements for a space to be defined as a sleeper berth. The simple definition is an area separate from (usually immediately behind) the driving controls that includes a bed. The rules do not explicitly require that a driver must sleep, only that a driver must take a period of [...] "rest" [...] within the sleeper berth or off-duty (i.e., home). A statement made by the ICC in 1937 gives the reason: [...] "We have no control over the manner in which a driver may spend his time off-duty, although some of his spare time activities may tire him as much as any work would do. We can only emphasize, by this comment, the responsibility which is the driver's own to assure himself of <b>adequate</b> <b>rest</b> and sleep, in the time available for this purpose, to ensure safety of his driving, and likewise the employer's responsibility to see that his drivers report for work in fit condition." ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Composite grafts allow {{complete}} arterial revascularization {{with minimal}} aortic manipulations. The Y???T configuration supplies all distal branches adequately, whereas {{it is unclear}} whether complex composite configurations (K, ?? or double-Y) are equally at rest or when challenged by maximal requirements. METHODS: Forty-seven patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery revascularization by multiple arterial composite grafts (K, ?? or double-Y) were retrospectively evaluated. Indication for this surgical option was porcelain aorta or conduit unavailability. Composite systems were evaluated by intraoperative flow measurements and perioperative transthoracic Doppler ultrasonography, 12 months later also by exercise test, sestamibi scintigraphy at rest and during induced hyperaemia and by 64 -slice multidetector CT angiography. RESULTS: A total of 141 distal anastomoses were implanted as composite grafts. Perioperative flow measurements and 12 -month Doppler ultrasonography were <b>adequate</b> at <b>rest.</b> At stress test, chest pain and/or induced ECG evidence of ischaemia are found in 16 patients (39 %). During dipyridamole-induced hyperaemia, single-photon emission computed tomography image revealed that mean summed stress score was 7. 2 ± 5. 7, summed difference score 5. 3 ± 4. 2 and coronary flow reserve 1. 7 ± 0. 2. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple composite grafts, albeit <b>adequate</b> at <b>rest,</b> were unable to meet flow requirements during maximal hyperaemia.

2500|$|... 'Over-training Syndrome' is a {{term that}} has been used to {{describe}} athletes who, while training for competition, train beyond the body's ability to recover naturally. Common warning signs include tiredness, soreness, drop in performance, headaches, and loss of enthusiasm. Without <b>adequate</b> <b>rest</b> and recovery, training regimens can backfire, eventually harming an athlete's performance. [...] Over-training can also be associated with eating disorders; athletes can turn to excessive exercise in order to lose weight. [...] In cases where athletes are over-training, the most effective treatment is rest and proper nutrition.|$|E

50|$|Overtraining is {{the result}} of giving your body more work or stress than it can handle. Overtraining occurs when a person {{experiences}} stress and physical trauma from exercising faster than their body can repair the damage. Overtraining can be described as a point where a person may have a decrease in performance and plateauing as a result from failure to consistently perform at a certain level or training load exceeds their recovery capacity. They cease making progress, and can even begin to lose strength and fitness. Overtraining is also known as chronic fatigue, burnout and overstress in athletes. It is suggested that there are different variations of overtraining, firstly monotonous program over training suggest that repetition of the same movement such as certain weight lifting and baseball batting can cause performance plateau due to an adaption of the central nervous system which results from a lack of stimulation. A second example of overtraining is described as chronic overwork type training where the subject may be training with too high intensity or high volume and not allowing sufficient recovery time for the body. It is important to note the difference between overtraining and over-reaching; over-reaching is when an athlete is undergoing hard training but with adequate recovery, overtraining however, is when an athlete is undergoing hard training without the adequate recovery. Up to 10% of elite endurance athletes and 10% of American college swimmers are affected by overtraining syndrome (unexplained underperformance for approximately 2 weeks even after having <b>adequate</b> <b>resting</b> time).|$|R

As regards meat quality, lairage duration significantly influenced the pHu which was higher (P< 0. 01) in the muscle of the “Long Lairage” group, the luminosity at 24 h post mortem which was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in animals of the “Short Lairage” group, and the red and yellow indices which were higher in the “Long Lairage” group. The “Short Lairage” group showed a lower (P< 0. 01) value of cooking loss and higher (P< 0. 01) value of tenderness. Data show that pre-slaughter lairage duration after a long transport may influence the blood parameters as well as meat quality. On the whole, the increase in lairage duration over 36 h does not determine any benefit for the animal’s well-being whereas it can cause a reduction in beef quality.
