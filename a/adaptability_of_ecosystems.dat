40|$|This paper {{provides}} the first {{assessment of the}} functional diversity (FD) of the Barents Sea fish community. FD is recognized as an important driver of ecosystem functions and, thus, governs the <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>ecosystems</b> {{in the face of}} disturbance. We integrate ecosystem survey data with an extensive trait matrix and show that fish FD displayed large spatial variation. The study period (2004 to 2009) was characterized by increasing water temperatures and decreasing ice coverage. FD remained stable between years in some areas but showed substantial variation in other areas. For instance, FD was consistently high in the central-west Barents Sea because of the high richness of functionally homogeneous species, whereas it varied strongly in northern areas through time. Such patterns of strong variation were probably driven by the strong warming trend registered in the study period. The species found in the eastern Barents Sea were more functionally distinct than those found in the west. Even though this pattern indicates that assemblages in the eastern areas display high adaptability relative to the number of species present, species loss in these areas will have a higher impact on the FD. Our findings show that FD gives more information about fish community structure and functioning than traditional biodiversity measures, and we suggest that such trait-based methods may constitute useful tools for future monitoring and management of marine fish communities...|$|E
30|$|The {{distribution}} of pollutants after flood events has an economic component {{in addition to}} social and ecological impacts. Economic consequences can be roughly differentiated in terms of direct (e.g., demolished infrastructure) and indirect (e.g., ecotoxicological and human adverse effects) costs. These consequences can translate into different types of costs, which reflect the action required to respond to potential environmental impacts. Prevention and protection costs reflect the economic consequences to fully or partially avoid negative environmental impacts and include costs of reducing the pollution of harmful substances in the environment {{as a result of}} flood events. The calculations in this subproject are mainly focused on the costs of the consequences of harmful emissions of pollutants associated with flood events. Since the dispersion of pollutants are subject to numerous factors (i.e., flood development, existing pollutant sources and sinks, hydro- and morphodynamics, flood-protection measures, population of flora and fauna, natural <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> proximity to drinking water-protection areas), environmental and economic impacts need to be estimated on the basis of scenario-based simulation studies. Calculating the {{distribution of}} harmful substances in ecosystems allows for an economic assessment of flood events, the consequences of which should consider the resulting damage and subsequent repair of ecosystems. Utilizing information obtained from other subprojects regarding their social and environmental assessments, the goal of this subproject is to derive an economic framework for the quantification of costs associated with prevention and elimination of flood-related impacts. The consideration of noneconomic parameters from other subprojects provides the unique opportunity to quantify this framework using specific measurements. For example, in collaboration with the “flood-tec” subproject, we can derive not only cost structures for novel water-treatment technologies, but also provide a sustainable business model assessing the prevention of the current monetary threat of flood events and its subsequent negative ecological impact. In addition, the negative ecological impact associated with the occurrence of EDC compounds in sediments examined by the “flood-hydrotox” subproject can be transformed into monetary variables, feeding the simulation models.|$|E
40|$|For marine {{biogeochemical}} models used in {{simulations of}} climate change scenarios, the ability to account for <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> marine <b>ecosystems</b> to environmental change is crucial. Biogeochemical models commonly include a single all [...] encompassing phytoplankton that does not exhibit any physiological flexibility, e. g. in stoichiometry. Hence, dynamics emerging from adaptation can not be simulated. As an alternative, more adaptive models exist that (1) increase physiological detail, or (2) resolve communities. Both approaches are investigated in this thesis, {{particularly with respect to}} the representation of phytoplankton elemental composition and its effect on model performance. It is shown that fixed phytoplankton stoichiometry impedes the adaptive potential of per se adaptive models. Consequently, allowing for stoichiometric variation provides a means of significantly improving model capabilities...|$|R

40|$|For marine {{biogeochemical}} models used in {{simulations of}} climate change scenarios, the ability to account for <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> marine <b>ecosystems</b> to environmental change becomes a concern. The potential for adaptation {{is expected to be}} larger for a diverse ecosystem compared to a monoculture of a single type of (model) algae, such as typically included in biogeochemical models. Recent attempts to simulate phytoplankton diversity in global marine ecosystem models display remarkable qualitative agreement with observed patterns of species distributions. However, modeled species diversity tends to be systematically lower than observed and, in many regions, is smaller than the number of potentially limiting nutrients. According to resource competition theory, the maximum number of coexisting species at equilibrium equals the number of limiting resources. By simulating phytoplankton communities in a chemostat model and in a global circulation model, we show here that a systematic underestimate of phytoplankton diversity may result from the standard modeling assumption of identical stoichiometry for the different phytoplankton types. Implementing stoichiometric variation among the different marine algae types in the models allows species to generate different resource supply niches via their own ecological impact. This is shown to increase the level of phytoplankton coexistence both in a chemostat model and in a global self-assembling ecosystem model. Key Points: - Common Redfield stoichiometry in plankton models impedes phytoplankton diversity - Stoichiometric plasticity increases the chance for sustained diversity - Modelers should go beyond Redfield stoichiometry in multi-phytoplankton model...|$|R

Climatic records show that large, widespread, abrupt climate changes have occurred repeatedly throughout the geological record. Some mechanisms have been identified that could account for these changes, and model simulations of them are improving, but the models that are currently being used to assess human impacts on climate do not yet simulate the past changes with great accuracy. Although public debate regarding climate change has focused on the climatic consequences of greenhouse-gas emissions and their impacts on the planet and on human societies, scientists and policymakers have given less attention to the possibility that large climate changes could occur quickly. Such abrupt climate changes could have natural causes, or could be triggered by humans and be among the “dangerous anthropogenic interferences ” referred to in the U. N...|$|R

Therefore, this research paper has focused on this specific relation between perceived leadership behaviour and the individual <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> team members. The research has been conducted on 278 members from 46 different teams of the Royal Netherlands Army. This research supports the claim that there is a significant relation between perceived leadership behaviour and individual <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> team members and more specific pin-points one dimension of leadership behaviour which significantly positively correlates with the individual <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> team members. This behavioural dimension of The Leadership Challenge is defined as “enabling others to act” (Posner & Kouzes, 1988). Behavioural aspects that belong to this dimension are: •	Foster collaboration by building trust and facilitating relationships: o	Setting goals that demand collaboration o	Support constant interaction o	Look for integrated solutions o	Invest in a relationship built on trust •	Strengthen others by increasing self-determination and developing competence: o	Enable others to lead themselves o	Let people be in control of themselves o	Give people a great deal of freedom and choice in deciding how to do their job o	Ensure that people grow in their jobs by learning new skills and by developing themselves o	Challenge people o	Support the decisions that people make on their own The scientific relevance of this research is that {{it can be used to}} point out more specifically which behavioural aspect of a team leader will influence the <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> team members.

As such a fire regime is defined by {{not only by the}} meteorological, physical, and biological properties <b>of</b> an <b>ecosystem,</b> but also by the spatial, temporal, and behavioral characteristics of the fires that burn in it. Although wildland fires are affected by many variables, the fire regime <b>of</b> a particular <b>ecosystem</b> usually is quite distinctive when defined within a particular historic time period. The fundamental premise for this discussion is that fire has been ubiquitous in all Great Lakes ecosystems during the Holocene Epoch, although the characteristic periodicity varies by several orders of magnitude according to regional and landscape ecosystem. Sooner or later—in some cases much sooner, in others much later—every ecosystem experiences fire. While usually considered an exogenous process, the very idea of a fire regime presupposes that fire is an integral part <b>of</b> <b>ecosystem</b> functioning and, in fact, may often be governed by endogenous ecosystem properties (White 1979). The relatively short fire-return intervals and fire cycles for many Great Lakes ecosystems, and the widespread <b>adaptability</b> <b>of</b> plants and animals in this region to fires, supports this contention.
