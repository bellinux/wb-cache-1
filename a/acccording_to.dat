40|$|Abstract. During the {{investigations}} into political corruption in Italy, judges {{emerged in the}} eyes of the public as the ‘heroes ’ of a peaceful revolution against the ‘villainous ’ politicians. The established explanation for the active role of the judiciary against corruption stresses the unusual degree of independence of Italian judges. Without denying the importance of this institutional variable, analysis of the interactions between politicians and judges in the history of the Italian Republic allows one to discuss the role of other two important variables: the informal networking between politicians and judges, and the professional culture of the magistracy. The three sets of variables are in fact used to explain two different strategies adopted by Italian judges in their interaction with the political system: a strategy of ‘role substitution’, <b>acccording</b> <b>to</b> which some judges act as a surrogate power for the protection of the citizens against corrupt politicians, and a ‘collusive strategy’, consisting of various levels of hidden exchanges between judges and politicians.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{determine}} the effects of varying inoculum size on in vitro susceptibility of SHV extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) -producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates to cefepime and cefpirome compared to previously established cephalosporins and aztreonam. MethodsAntibiotic susceptibilities were determined by disk diffusion test, the MIC broth microdilution method, and time–kill studies with two different inocula of 105 and 107 CFU/mL. The strains were classified into four groups <b>acccording</b> <b>to</b> the type of β-lactamase they produce: SHV- 2, SHV- 5, SHV- 12, and ESBL-negative klebsiellae. ResultsThe antibacterial activities of cefpirome and cefepime were comparable to that of cefotaxime, but were significantly greater than those of ceftazidime and aztreonam. An inoculum effect was detected for all broad-spectrum cephalosporins, but it was more pronounced with cefpirome and cefepime compared to older cephalosporins. The disk diffusion test proved to be not sensitive enough for the detection of an inoculum effect, particularly for cefepime. ConclusionsThe present study found that most SHV-producing klebsiellae have MICs of cefpirome that imply susceptibility at the moderate inoculum size, {{in spite of the fact}} that, according to the NCCLS, all ESBL producers should be considered resistant to all cephalosporins, independent of MIC values. With a high inoculum, most of the strains seemed to be resistant to both antibiotics. Furthermore, the bactericidal activities of cefpirome and cefepime against isogenic Escherichia coli strains producing SHV- 2, SHV- 4 and SHV- 5 β-lactamases, respectively, were also inoculum dependent. Bactericidal activity against SHV- 4 and SHV- 5 β-lactamase producers was obtained only at the moderate inoculum, whereas the SHV- 2 β-lactamase producer was efficiently killed with both antibiotics, regardless of the inoculum size...|$|E

Species {{richness}} increased from seven species upstream to 32 species downstream in the river. Shannon-Wiener’s species diversity also increased from 1. 24 in the upstream to 2. 52 in the downstream section. The fish fauna of the Tachia River could be divided into three fish zones <b>acccording</b> <b>to</b> the fish fauna study of Tsao (1994), this study, and the positions of dams in the river. Varicorhinus barbatulus and Crossostoma lacustre were the dominant species in the upper segment between the Kukuan and Tienluen Dams. Zacco spp., Acrossochelius paradoxus, and Hemimyzon formosanum were the most abundant species in midstream between the Tienluen and Shikuan Dams. Zacco spp. Tilapia sp., and Mugil cephalus were the dominant species in the downstream segment below Shikuan Dam. Both fish richness and diversity indices were higher in the down-stream than upstream sections. Among six widely distrubuted speices, Zacco spp. were not found upstream of Tienluen Dam, although it was dominant below Tienluen Dam. Except for the section below Shikuan Dam, the fish species richness and relative abundance showed no seasonal change. In the section below Shikuan Dam, more species and individ-uals were sampled in summer and autumn than in spring or winter. In flooding periods (e. g., summer and autumn), some species which predominated in upstream sections, including V. barbatulus, Leiocassis adiposalis, H. formosanum, and C. lacustre, could be col-lected frequently below Shikuan Dam. Species occurring near the river mouth could move further upstream during the flooding period. Native Anguilla japonicus and Sicyopterus japonica were caught near Shikuan Dam during the flooding period. The dams play a role in regulating downstream flow which may disrupt the river gradient and block upstream fish migration, and thus subsequently affect zonation of fish fauna in this river system...|$|E
40|$|We examine {{patterns}} of 'gamma' (within-region) and 'beta' (between-region) diversity from {{analysis of a}} presence/absence dataset for species of asteroids encompassing the whole Atlantic Ocean partitioned into 26 regions. Absolute species numbers (a poor measure of biodiversity) in shallow coastal areas and the deep sea are the same, although species richness per area for two well-sampled regions suggests, qualitatively, that coastal areas ma) : be more speciose. Taxonomic distinctness (Delta*), an index which is markedly less sample-size dependent than other common diversity measures, shows no significant association with geographic area and no clear pattern with depth? suggesting an absence of latitudinal and coastal/deep trends. Cluster analysis shows that distinctive faunal assemblages are most evident in shelf/ shallow waters, where six groupings separate recognizably <b>acccording</b> <b>to</b> geographical location. Three of these are the southernmost regions of the Atlantic (southeast of S. America, S. Angola/S. Africa & Tristan da Cunha/Gough Island) and are characterized by their isolation {{and high levels of}} endemism. As depth increases so does the amount of faunal similarity between regions. This indicates that beta diversity is highest in shelf regions and lowest in low er bathyal/abyssal regions. Our results may support the contention which questions the emerging paradigm that the deep sea has exceptionally high diversity. It is evident, however, that comparisons (e. g. between coasts and the deep sea) are problematic and can depend very much on the element(s) of biodiversity measured, sampling methods and the spatial scales (e. g. alpha, beta or gamma diversity) over which assessment is made. Any wider conclusions should therefore be drawn cautiously, particularly since assessment is made of only one faunal group. Other findings include significant correlation between the depth range of asteroids and their geographical range. The utility of low-resolution datasets is reviewed. It is concluded that within limitations they can be of value for determining broad (e. g. regional, ocean-scale and global-scale) {{patterns of}} diversity and community structure, especially when analysed using measures relatively uninfluenced by sample size.

40|$|Storytelling is {{considered}} an interactional phenomenon which involves intricate and artful constructions used by the narrator to recapitulate his/her past-experience <b>acccording</b> <b>to</b> the community expectations. Social rules determine the type of information that will be generated, and the way such information will be coded, and interpreted. Thus, storytelling {{plays an important role}} in the socialization process of children. It reflects the process of acquisition of social and cultural norms. ^ This study examines children 2 ̆ 7 s presentation of themselves by the actions expressed in the narrative clauses, and the use of dramatization devices in children 2 ̆ 7 s oral narratives; namely, direct speech, deictic terms, repetitions, onomatopoeic forms, expressive phonology and selected features at the paralinguistic level. ^ Frequency counts have been provided regarding different linguistic and extralinguistic factors to justify the occurrence of the devices. ^ The analysis reveals that age and sex of the speaker are factors of great significance in the study of storytelling. In general, boys were found to be more assertive, challenging and aggressive than girls, and used more dramatization devices. This differentiation sharpens as children grow up, and is particularly marked for girls. As girls grow older, they restrain their expressiveness. ^ The two main functions of dramatization devices concern highlighting an element considered relevant to the final import of the story, and credibility. By presenting the events as real, they will be more credible to the audience. Both functions, highlighting and credibility, were seen as related to claiming the floor. These two functions appeared to have a stronger effect on boys than on girls. Storytelling for boys represents an opportunity to assert themselves and to display their expressive ability. This result also suggests that boys and girls have different cultural rules that regulate their behaviour. To narrate requires not only linguistic knowledge, but also the knowledge of aspects of language used according to social norms. ...|$|E
40|$|Integration or {{inclusion}} {{of people with}} disabilities into the intact society is currently widely discussed in the area of disability. This process is very long and complicated. The results of integrating this person into class of other intact students don´t depends only on a work of teacher, but also on familier diagnostic and on all stimulation program, which helps to the best integrable child. Integration of persons with autism spectrum disorder, whose behaviour is often problematic, can be difficult. But there are individuals who can be, usually {{with the help of an}} assistant, integrated into primary school among intact peers. The lack of special education of the teacher can be a disadvantage of the integration. If the teacher does not have enough experience with autism, the teaching can become a problem. That is why information and communication technologies, such as SmartBoard, which is very easily operated, may be a considerable help. Therefore it is suitable for individuals with fine motor skills disabilities and can attract both intact children and children with autism spectrum disorder. This thesis is focused on the use of Smart Board for children with autism spectrum disorder who are integrated at usual primary schools and for whose education and training special approaches are needed. The theoretical part deals with the definition of mental retardation, its etiology symptomatology and division. It also describes dementia of children who lose their previously mastered skills and abilities. A large section of the theoretical part deals with autism spectrum disorders, which are congenital and therefore lifelong disabilities significantly detrimental to the mental development of the individual, and describes etiology, prevalence and symptomatology focusing on the triad of the problem areas. It deals with affiliated disabilities and division of autism spectrum disorders, early infantile autism, atypical autism and other childhood disintegrative disorders, e. g. Asperger syndrome and schizoid childhood disorders. Diagnosis, education and training of individuals with this type of disability are mentioned in this part of my thesis as well. The practical part is based on the information obtained through questionnaires. It is therefore quantitative research using methods of questioning. The research files are all primary schools in the Czech Republic. The data from primary schools that integrate individuals with autism spectrum disorder were examined primarily.
