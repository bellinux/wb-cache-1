5|$|A notable {{find in the}} Fosse Way burials was a Chi-Rho amulet, at {{the time}} thought {{to be from the}} 5th century, and {{considered}} to be among the earliest definite evidence of Christianity in England. A copy of the amulet was presented to the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, by the churches of the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Although the amulet is in the Museum of Somerset, <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> Liverpool University in 2008 using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy demonstrated that it was a hoax, as its silver content dated to the 19th century or later.|$|E
5|$|A {{previous}} <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos of commensurabilities {{among the}} known ETNOs using Monte Carlo techniques revealed a pattern {{similar to that}} of the Kuiper belt, where accidental commensurabilities occur due to objects in resonances with Neptune. They find that this pattern would be best explained if the ETNOs were in resonance with an additional planetary-sized object beyond Pluto and note that a number of these objects may be in 5:3 and 3:1 resonances if that object had semi-major axis of ≈700 AU.|$|E

For instance, {{estimates of the number of}} species in the orchid genus Pleurothallis range from 1,120 to 2,500. Genera from other groups of vascular plants, but which have similarly large numbers of species, include Selaginella, Asplenium and Cyathea.|$|E

Purina ONE has been its fastest-growing brand.|$|E
5|$|According to an <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> Tim Flannery, the {{ecosystem}} of Lord Howe Island {{is threatened by}} climate change and global warming, with the reefs at risk from rises in water temperature. The Great Barrier Reef is specifically identified as being at risk {{to the effects of}} global warming on Australia, and the same analysis applies to the reefs of Lord Howe Island. Cool climate flora and fauna are at risk from rises in temperature, because there is limited scope for migration to higher altitudes.. The first international conference on global artificial photosynthesis as a climate change solution occurred at Lord Howe island in 2011, the papers being published by the Australian Journal of Chemistry.|$|E

5|$|According to the U.S. Department of Energy, {{combined}} sales of plug-in hybrids and battery electric {{cars in the}} American market climbed more rapidly and outsold by more than double sales of hybrid-electric vehicles over their respective 24 month introductory periods. A 2016 <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) found that 5 years after its introduction, sales of plug-in electric cars in the U.S. continued to outsell conventional hybrids. An <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> Scientific American found a similar trend {{at the international level}} when considering the global top selling PEVs over a 36-month introductory period. Monthly sales of the Volt, Prius PHV and Leaf performed better than the conventional Prius during their respective introductory periods, {{with the exception of the}} Mitsubishi i-MiEV, which has been outsold most of the time by the Prius HEV over their 36-month introductory periods.|$|E
5|$|An <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> British staff {{officers}} of the initial period of the Normandy campaign found that 7% of all German tanks destroyed by British forces were knocked out by PIATs, compared to 6% by rockets fired by aircraft. However, {{they also found that}} once German tanks had been fitted with armoured skirts that detonated hollow-charge ammunition before it could penetrate the tank's armour, the weapon became much less effective.|$|E
5|$|Both the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} and the dodo are now extinct. A common {{threshold of}} the extinction of the dodo is 1662, but some possible sightings had been made as late as 1688. The last sighting with a description was in 1662, but a statistical <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> Roberts and Solow found that the extinction of the dodo was in 1693. The Rodrigues solitaire was killed off later than the dodo. The IUCN uses an extinction date of 1778 for the solitaire, although a more probable date {{would be in the}} 1750s or 1760s. Both birds became extinct as a consequence of human hunting and the introduction of mammals that ate the birds and their eggs.|$|E
