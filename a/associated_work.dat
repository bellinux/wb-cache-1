25|$|The West Coast Main Line upgrade was a {{long-term}} project covering {{a series of}} technical aspects. Improvements included the four-tracking (from three) of the Trent Valley (a bypass of the West Midlands), redesigning the layout of several junction/stations e.g. Rugby and other <b>associated</b> <b>work</b> to increase line speed. This culminated in tilting trains at 125mph being extended to Glasgow in 2005. The cost overruns of the programme are infamous - attributed to wide scope of programme (the promise to Virgin to build a 140mph railway which would require moving block signalling) and poor project management by the defunct Railtrack.|$|E
2500|$|The {{extension}} uses an alignment between Surrey Quays and Queens Road Peckham {{stations that}} had not seen services since 1913. The [...] "new" [...] section diverges from the East London Line south of Surrey Quays station and joins the South London Line {{just north of the}} closed Old Kent Road station. The route skirts the Bridgehouse Meadows public open space; this was used as the construction site, then restored to public use after completion. The former pedestrian bridge and support piers over Surrey Canal Road were demolished as a precursor to building the railway bridge. The planned lowering of Surrey Canal Road and <b>associated</b> <b>work</b> to the services were not carried out as a higher elevation was adopted, with a 1 in 30 (3.3 per cent) incline allowing the railway to cross at a suitable height.|$|E
2500|$|It {{appears that}} the Trechsel {{brothers}} initially intended to hire Holbein for illustrating Bibles. In fact, some of Holbein's Icones woodcuts appear in the recently discovered Biblia cum Glossis by Michel De Villeneuve (Michael Servetus).
