40|$|The {{robustness}} of {{a system}} is a property that pervades all aspects of Nature. The ability {{of a system}} to adapt itself to perturbations due to internal and external agents, to aging, to wear, to environmental changes {{is one of the}} driving forces of evolution and a fundamental design principle. At the molecular level, understanding the robustness of a protein has a great impact on the in silicon design of polypeptide chains and drugs; the chance of computationally checking the ability of a protein to preserve its structure and function in the native state can lead to the design of new compounds that can work in a living cell more effectively. Inspired by the well known robustness analysis framework used in Electronic Design Automation, we introduced a notion of robustness for proteins and two dimensionless quantities: the energetic robustness and the energetic relative entropy. We used the energetic robustness in order to quantify the yield of a protein in terms of potential energy, and to detect sensitive regions and sensitive residues in the protein, whereas we adopted the energetic relative entropy to measure the discrepancy between two potential energy distributions. Subsequently, we implemented a new robustness-centered protein design algorithm called Robust-Protein-Design (RPD); the aim of the algorithm is to discover new conformations with a specific function and with high robustness values. We performed an extensive characterization of the robustness property of many peptides, proteins, and drugs. Moreover, we found that robustness and relative entropy are conflicting objectives which constitute a trade-off useful <b>as</b> <b>design</b> <b>principle</b> for new proteins and drugs. Finally, we used the RPD algorithm on the Crambin protein (1 CRN); the obtained results confirm that the algorithm was able to find out a Crambin-like protein that is 23 % more robust than the wild type...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} our ongoing {{research about}} {{what it takes to}} design things that can be ensouled or can achieve heirloom status as a matter related to sustainable design. This paper draws on research on fifteen deep narratives that we collected to uncover detailed accounts of relationships between each participant and a single particular loved artifact or collection of a single type. Three themes emerged from our analysis of the narratives: (i) intimacy accumulated as an association with an object over time, (ii) investment of effort to learn and control functionality, and (iii) implicit values related to the patterns of collection of artifacts. In conceptualizing these three themes as an analytical frame, we arrived at two unifying notions that generally apply across many of the narratives and that serve <b>as</b> catalysts to <b>design</b> <b>principles,</b> namely the notion of rarity of an object, and the notion of aficionado-appeal of an object. We conclude by considering how these unifying notions can be used reflectively and judiciously to prompt <b>design</b> <b>principles</b> for interaction designers at least, and possibly <b>as</b> <b>design</b> <b>principles</b> in-and-of-themselves...|$|R

40|$|Software reuse {{can occur}} in various places during the {{software}} development cycle. Reuse of existing source code is the most commonly practiced form of software reuse. One of the key requirements for software reuse is readability, thus the interest {{in the use of}} data abstraction, inheritance, modularity, and aspects of the visible portion of module specifications. This research analyzed the contents of software reuse libraries to answer the basic question of what makes a good reusable software component. The approach taken was to measure and analyze various software metrics <b>as</b> mapped to <b>design</b> characteristics. A related research question investigated the change in the <b>design</b> <b>principles</b> over time. This was measured by comparing sets of Ada reuse libraries categorized into two time periods. It was discovered that recently developed Ada reuse components scored better on readability than earlier developed components. A benefit of this research has been the development of a set of "design for reuse" guidelines. These guidelines address coding practices <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>design</b> <b>principles</b> for an Ada implementation.
