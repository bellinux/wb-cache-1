5|$|In 2003, Pulido {{made his}} acting debut by {{starring}} in the made-for-television film La Decada Furiosa. He also appeared in the telenovelas Fuego en La Sangre and Qué pobres tan ricos. His album Enfermo de Amor (2007) was commercially unsuccessful, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> three-year hiatus. Pulido returned to music in March 2010 and released an album titled Dias de Ayer; he also returned to acting and guest-starred in the film Noches Con Platanito. Aside from music and film, Pulido married Eliza Anzaldua in July 1996. Pulido filed for divorce in September 2013, after having fathered three sons with Anzaldua.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914, van Meegeren moved his family to Scheveningen. That year, he {{completed}} the diploma examination at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague. The diploma allowed him to teach, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> position as the assistant to Professor Gips, the Professor of Drawing and Art History, for the small monthly salary of 75 guldens. In March 1915, his daughter Pauline was born, later called Inez. To supplement his income, Han sketched posters and painted pictures for the commercial art trade, generally Christmas cards, still-life, landscapes, and portraits. Many of these paintings are quite valuable today.|$|E
5|$|Small {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Trinidad on 11 November 1909, playing against a team chosen by WC Shepherd. Small scored 13 and 0 in the match and bowled two over {{without taking a}} wicket. The following January, Small made his first appearance for Trinidad in the Inter-Colonial Tournament; he scored seven runs in his only innings and took four for 16 in British Guiana's first innings. In the final against Barbados, he took one wicket {{in the game and}} scored 17 and 8 in his two innings. Trinidad won the match. Later that year, Small played against Barbados again, in the final of the next Inter-Colonial Tournament, but had little success in that match, nor in the 1912 tournament when his best score in two games was 15 runs, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> total of three wickets. In both instances, Barbados won the tournament.|$|E

5|$|Small only played {{twice more}} in {{first-class}} cricket. There was no first-class cricket in West Indies during the 1930–31 season, but {{he played in}} the Trinidad team which won the 1931–32 Inter-Colonial Tournament. In his final first-class innings, he scored 66 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> wicket with his final delivery. In his career, he scored 3,063 first-class runs at a batting average of 26.17 and took 165 wickets at an average of 27.81. Small continued to play successfully in South Trinidad in local leagues until the early 1940s. He died following a short illness in Pointe-à-Pierre, Trinidad, on 26 April 1958 at the age of 65, having been largely forgotten in the West Indies. However, in 1984, he was entered into the Trinidad and Tobago Sports Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|The silver medals {{from the}} 2007 Osaka World Championships boosted Bolt's desire to run, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> more serious, more mature stance towards his career. Bolt {{continued}} {{to develop in}} the 100 m, and he entered {{to run in the}} event at the Jamaica Invitational in Kingston. On 3 May 2008, Bolt ran a time of 9.76 s, with a 1.8 m/s tail wind, improving his personal best from 10.03 s. This was the second-fastest legal performance {{in the history of the}} event, second only to compatriot Asafa Powell's 9.74 s record set the previous year in Rieti, Italy. Rival Tyson Gay lauded the performance, praising Bolt's form and technique especially. Michael Johnson, who was observing the race, said that he was shocked at how quickly he had improved over the 100 m distance. The Jamaican surprised even himself with the time, but coach Glen Mills remained confident that there was more to come.|$|E
5|$|Armed {{conflict}} erupted {{again in}} 1459, and again Clifford {{was found on}} the side of the King and Queen. Clifford took part in the parliament that attainted the Yorkists– by now in exile– <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> share of the profits from their lands, as well as being appointed to offices traditionally in their keeping. The Yorkist lords returned from exile in June 1460 and subsequently defeated a royal army at Northampton. As a result of the royalist defeat, Clifford was ordered to surrender such castles and offices as he had from the Nevilles back to them, although it is unlikely that he did so. In fact, he and his fellow northern Lancastrian lords merely commenced a campaign of destruction on Neville and Yorkist estates and tenantry, to such an extent that in December 1460, the duke of York and his close ally, the earl of Salisbury, raised an army and headed north to crush the Lancastrian rebellion. This winter campaign culminated in the Battle of Wakefield in the last days of the year, and was a decisive victory for the Lancastrian army, of which Clifford was by now an important commander. The battle resulted in the deaths of both York and Salisbury, but was probably most notorious for Clifford's slaying of Edmund, Earl of Rutland, York's seventeen-year old second son and the younger brother of the future King Edward IV. This may have resulted in Clifford's being nicknamed 'Butcher Clifford,' although historians disagree as to how widely used by contemporaries this term was.|$|E

25|$|He {{proceeded}} {{to take the}} next 6 wickets, reducing England to 132/7, and at that point, would have harboured hopes of capturing all 10 wickets. However, the next wicket to fall was to a run out. But this did not deter him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> further wicket – that of Jon Lewis to leave the score at 153/9. England {{were on the verge of}} defeat, still needing 172 to win with one wicket remaining.|$|E

25|$|Esau {{was filled}} with hatred toward Jacob for taking away both his {{birthright}} and his blessing. He vowed to himself to kill Jacob as soon as Isaac died. Here again, Rebecca prophetically perceived his murderous intentions and ordered Jacob to travel to her brother Laban's house in Haran, until Esau's anger subsided. She then convinced Isaac to send Jacob away, by telling him that she despaired of him marrying a local girl from the idol-worshipping families of Canaan (as Esau had done). After Isaac sent Jacob away to find a wife, Esau realized that his own Canaanite wives were evil in his father's eyes, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> daughter of Isaac's half-brother Ishmael as another wife.|$|E
