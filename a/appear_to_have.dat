5|$|In circa 1250 BC, {{the first}} wave of {{destruction}} has been witnessed in various centers of mainland Greece for reasons that cannot be identified by archaeologists. These incidents <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> triggered the massive strengthening and expansion of the fortifications in various sites. In some cases, arrangements were also made for the creation of subterranean passages which led to underground cisterns. Nevertheless, none of these measures <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> prevented the final destruction of the Mycenaean palace centers in the 12th century BC. The reasons that lead to the collapse of the Mycenaean culture have been hotly debated among scholars. The two most common theories are population movement and internal conflict.|$|E

25|$|El Zotz <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{passed through}} a period of renewed {{prosperity}} during the Late Classic and the city would have had close interactions with its near neighbours, such as Tikal, Uaxactun, Motul de San José and El Tintal. El Zotz <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been particularly densely inhabited during the Terminal Classic. Although El Zotz <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> received strong influences from Tikal, it <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> taken its place in the larger political rivalry between Tikal and Calakmul and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> aligned itself with Tikal's great enemy in order to gain local advantage. When Tikal recovered from its misfortunes it appears that El Zotz was unable to survive its attentions.|$|R
50|$|The {{myrosinase}} from Brevicoryne brassicae <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> evolved {{separately from}} myrosinases found in plants, possibly {{a case of}} convergent evolution.

5|$|Under Diocletian, {{the number}} of legions, and {{probably}} of other units, more than doubled.

Even so, scholars generally agree that Diocletian increased army numbers substantially, by at least 33%.|$|E
5|$|Archaea, a {{group of}} prokaryotes {{separate}} from bacteria, also feature flagella driven by rotary motor proteins, which are structurally and evolutionarily distinct from bacterial flagella.

5|$|Bupropion {{is known}} to affect several {{different}} biological targets. It often {{is described as a}} norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), and is also a nicotinic antagonist. However, bupropion does not <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> significant dopaminergic actions in humans under normal clinical circumstances. Chemically, bupropion belongs to the class of aminoketones and is similar in structure to stimulants such as cathinone and amfepramone, and to phenethylamines in general.|$|E

5|$|During evolution, darts <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{been lost}} secondarily, i.e., {{after they had}} evolved and been functional. Vestigial darts (ones that exist only in a {{rudimentary}} condition) occur in the family Sagdidae, and in many Helicoidea, the surrounding organs have also degenerated (become non-functional). The sarcobelum is a fleshy or cuticle-coated papilla which {{is considered to be}} a degenerated, previously dart-bearing, organ.|$|E
5|$|During {{symptomatic}} attacks, {{administration of}} {{high doses of}} intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the usual therapy, with oral corticosteroids seeming to have a similar efficacy and safety profile. Although, in general, effective {{in the short term}} for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a significant impact on long-term recovery. The consequences of severe attacks that do not respond to corticosteroids might be treatable by plasmapheresis.|$|E
