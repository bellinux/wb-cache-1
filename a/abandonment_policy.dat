40|$|Farmland {{abandonment}} {{has important}} impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem recovery, {{as well as}} food security and rural sustainable development. Due to rapid urbanization and industrialization, farmland abandonment has become an increasingly important problem in many countries, particularly in China. To promote sustainable land-use management and environmental sustainability, {{it is important to}} understand the socioeconomic causes and spatial patterns of farmland abandonment. In this study, we explored the dynamic mechanisms of farmland abandonment in Jiangxi province of China using a spatially explicit economical model. The results show that the variables associated with the agricultural products yield are significantly correlated with farmland abandonment. The increasing opportunity cost of farming labor is the main factor in farmland abandonment in conjunction with a rural labor shortage due to rural-to-urban population migration and regional industrialization. Farmlands are more likely to be abandoned in areas located far from the villages and towns due to higher transportation costs. Additionally, farmers with more land but lower net income are more likely to abandon poor-quality farmland. Our results support the hypothesis that farmland abandonment takes place in locations in which the costs of cultivation are high and the potential crop yield is low. In addition, our study also demonstrates that a spatially explicit economic model is necessary to distinguish between the main driving forces of farmland <b>abandonment.</b> <b>Policy</b> implications are also provided for potential future policy decisions...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} why Japan and Switzerland {{have chosen to}} keep the vocabulary of Article 9 and neutrality, respectively, and to reinterpret their definitions to suit their needs (policy reinterpretation), instead of simply abandoning the original policy {{and replacing it with}} a new, more suitably worded policy that clarifies the changing policy position of the government (<b>policy</b> <b>abandonment).</b> By analyzing the legal history of the overseas capabilities of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces and the Swiss Armed Forces, as well as the actions and influences of the government, political parties, and the public, this study finds the following trends. First, the government tends to refrain from <b>policy</b> <b>abandonment</b> either due to perceived public opposition or benefits in international negotiations. Second, party resistance is not an significantly influential factor in the choice of <b>policy</b> <b>abandonment</b> over <b>policy</b> reinterpretation. Finally, public opinion is influential, but self-contradictory; often supporting the change in policy (increased overseas capabilities of armed forces) but opposing the concept of <b>policy</b> <b>abandonment</b> due to high attachment to the respective policies of Article 9 and neutrality...|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} {{deregulation}} {{in creating a}} viable private rail freight system in the ?U. S. since 1979 is relatively undisputed. Deregulation has proceeded in three ways: (i) eased rate setting restrictions; (ii) simplified merger applications and approval procedures; and (iii) relaxed route <b>abandonment</b> <b>policies.</b> In this paper we attempt to disentangle the effects of deregulation on rail costs from those directly attributable to mergers and acquisitions. We employ a translog variable cost function, based on an unbalanced panel data set of annual observations for major U. S. Class I railroads from 1974 to 1986. We find that both deregulation and mergers contributed significantly to cost savings. However, of the accumulated cost savings achieved by the six major firms involved in mergers post-deregulation, we estimate that by 1986 about 91 % of the reduction in accumulated costs is due to deregulation, and about 9 % is directly due to mergers and acquisitions (which in turn were facilitated by regulatory reforms). In terms of factor biases, we find that both deregulation and mergers resulted in a substantial labor-saving bias; the point estimate of the deregulation labor-saving bias is larger than that for mergers, but {{we were not able}} to estimate this bias precisely. We conclude that mergers were not a prerequisite for railroads being able to achieve substantial cost and productivity improvements in our 1974 - 1986 sample period. Deregulation also had an enormous direct impact; indeed, its impact appears to have been much larger. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the reasons why Spain which possesses a consolidated democratic regime continues to promote democracy and even good governance in certain countries in such an uncertain, ambiguous manner. Recent events, such as the impact of international terrorism, have meant {{that there is an}} even more urgent need for providing democratic assistance to the neighbouring countries of the Maghreb region. In spite of its initial limitations and slants,the very concept of governance would represent a non-intrusive promotion of democracy. Nevertheless, Spain’s actors in the field of foreign policy and cooperation with development (as the case of Algeria illustrates perfectly) have been clearly reluctant to commit themselves to this course of action. Spain’s patent energy dependence on Algeria (a fact that is often put forward as the main explanatory reason) is called into question, with an argument based not only on the evidence of Spanish action in other countries in regions (such as Tunisia and Latin America), but also in an analysis of the discourses and instruments of Spanish foreign policy. As an alternative explanation, it is suggested that practices that have long been used in Spain’s “Arab” foreign policy, the pending reform of the external service, the Europeisation of external action and the “second-player syndrome” (i. e. second to France), provide a better explanation ofSpain’s ambiguousness and of its slow <b>abandonment</b> of <b>policies</b> that favour the status quo...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} British street tramways is {{surveyed}} and contrasted with other urban transport modes from 1860 {{to date and}} the generally accepted reasons for the industry's decline summarised. These theories are then tested, illlustrated and amplified by three case studies of tramways in South Yorkshire, namely the small Dearne District, the medium-sized Doncaster and the major Sheffield undertakings. The history of each system is detailed with particular attention being given to later developments. In each case contrasts and parallels are drawn with competing modes [...] either motor buses or trolleybuses in this area [...] and with tramways {{in other parts of}} the country. The Dearne District tramway was loss-making throughout, and the reasons for inadequate receipts and/or excessive working and capital costs are examined, particularly by contrast with the competing and profitable Yorkshire Traction bus company, which ultimately bought out the tramway in 1933. The Doncaster tramways were more successful, alternating between profit and loss, but after World War I were subject to severe external restraints [...] such as stagnation in the local economic base and private motor bus competition [...] and also suffered from rapid deterioration of capital assets. Each of these difficulties is analysed and the eventual successful replacement of trams by 1935 by (mostly) trolleybuses described and discussed. Sheffield's tramways were financially viable up to and including World War II, the reasons for this including the virtual elimination of private motor bus competition, Sheffield's topography and the heavy traffic typical of a city tramway; a particular contrast is drawn with Manchester, where tramway <b>abandonment</b> became <b>policy</b> much earlier. The financial and in particular the planning reasons why Sheffield's policy changed after 1945 are then examined. Tramway replacement was completed by 1960.

25|$|During the 1980s, British Waterways {{began to}} {{introduce}} a hydraulic system for operating paddles, especially those on bottom gates, which are the heaviest to operate. A metal cylinder about a foot in diameter was mounted on the balance beam and contained a small oil-operated hydraulic pump. A spindle protruded from the front face and was operated by a windlass in the usual way, the energy being transferred to the actual paddle by small bore pipes. The system was widely installed and on some canals it became very common. There {{turned out to be}} two serious drawbacks. It was much more expensive to install and maintain than traditional gear and went wrong more frequently, especially once vandals learned to cut the pipes. Even worse, it had a safety defect, in that the paddle once in the raised position could not be dropped in an emergency, but had to be wound down, taking a good deal longer.

40|$|The U. S. Great Inflation of the 1970 s was {{characterized}} by repeated, failed attempts at disinflation by the Federal Reserve as well as periods of inaction despite rising inflation. Previous research has attributed these failures to policymakers’ “misperceptions” about monetary policy and the macroeconomy. This paper argues instead that the Fed’s behavior during this period can be explained {{as a response to}} political constraints. Members of the Fed understood that a serious attempt to tackle inflation would be unpopular with the public and would generate opposition from Congress and the Executive branch. The result was a commitment to the policy of gradualism, under which the Fed would attempt to reduce inflation with mild policies that would not trigger an outright recession, and premature <b>abandonment</b> of anti-inflation <b>policies</b> {{at the first sign of}} recession. The Fed managed to disinflate successfully under Chairman Volcker only when the political constraints on Fed policy were lifted after 1979, allowing the Fed to abandon the policy of gradualism and knowingly take actions that risked recession.

We have recently reviewed the cases of tuberculous meningitis seen at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow. 3 Between 1968 and 1986, 15 children were seen because of this condition. Fourteen were white and only one was Asian. The mean age at presentation was 2 years (12 months to 12 years) and none had received BCG vacci-nation. In 12 children close contact with other cases of tuberculosis was identified. It is clear that the practice of offering BCG vaccination to children at 13 years of age was too late to protect the children we studied from acquiring the infection. Routine BCG vaccination of all neonates was stopped in Glasgow in 1974 and since then has been offered only to babies of Asian or Chinese origin. This may partly explain why most cases of tuberculous meningitis seen in our hospital occur-red in white children. We agree with the recommendation of the World Health Organisation that the use of BCG vaccination should be as early in life as possible and stress that any <b>abandonment</b> of such <b>policy</b> must be accompanied by meticulous case reporting and contact tracing if more cases of this serious condition are to be avoided...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I review recent stakeholding {{proposals}} and critically assess their implications for debates on {{local and regional}} economic development. I highlight some of the benefits, tensions, and ambiguities of the stakeholding metaphor, before considering whether it offers a blueprint {{for the construction of}} more ethically and socially responsible regional and local economies. I argue that the idea's main limitations stem from its basis in a notion of corporate autonomy which detracts from the diversity of ways in which places and regional contexts condition the range of feasible and beneficial company strategies.

In the final section of the paper I briefly examine the use of stakeholding in public policy debates in Britain, and the likely geographical consequences. I argue that {{the use of the term}} reflects an optimistic communitarianism, and that the benefits of emphasising community participation, rights, and responsibilities should not be used to legitimate a <b>policy</b> <b>abandonment</b> of those communities lacking the resources to participate as stakeholders. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the postwar}} period fiscal policy in the United States has gone through two broad phases: fiscal expansiveness and fiscal restraint. During the long {{expansion}} of the 1960 s, policy took a deliberately Keynesian approach to macroeconomic management. In the early 1960 s President Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisers argued that the economy was being slowed by a large structural budget surplus; the surplus, resulting from excessively high tax revenues, was slowing aggregate demand before the economy reached full employment. A tax cut proposed in 1962 and enacted in 1964 led to a lowering of the budget surplus. President Johnson's War on Poverty {{and the war in}} Vietnam boosted government spending and contributed to further lowering of the surplus. The large and growing budget deficits of the 1970 s along with stagflation called into question the Keynesian demand management policies of the previous decade. The <b>abandonment</b> of these <b>policies</b> coincided with the implementation of "supply-side " policies during the Reagan years. Ironically, the combination of large tax cuts, reduced domestic spending, and massive defense spending produced huge budget deficits during the relatively long expansion of the 1980 s.

For domestic demand and import share equations, an AIDS framework was applied to derive demand elasticities. As {{an alternative to the}} traditional excess demand approach, and to represent the outcomes of a reformed and open cereal sub-sector in Morocco, the study introduces a module that endogenizes government behavior of cereal imports. The study took a bold first step toward incorporating a policy structure in a theoretically sound framework for soft wheat price determination. The results of statistical tests show that convexity of profit function is rejected, cereal production is integrated with that of livestock, and the Armington trade model is not suitable for Moroccan cereal imports. Furthermore, policy analysis indicates that the <b>abandonment</b> of government <b>policy</b> in soft wheat market results in a decrease in producer price and an increase in consumer price.

Plans to privatise Royal Mail were abandoned {{as a result of}} pressure from Labour, the Communications Workers Union and voters in Conservative rural heartlands who sought to protect post office services. Another major <b>policy</b> <b>abandonment</b> came as a result of Norman Lamont’s 1993 announcement that VAT on domestic fuel and lighting would be introduced, starting at a rate of 8% in April 1994 and reaching the full rate the following April.

An important House of Commons vote on introducing the second stage of the tax took place in December 1994. Concerted pressure was put on Conservative backbenchers from marginal seats to vote against the controversial tax, and in the end the Major Government was narrowly defeated, with 319 voting against the tax compared to 311 for. This not only represented a victory for the Labour party’s campaign, but it further demonstrated Labour's social democratic credentials and its growing political strength.

40|$|Magister Legum - LLMThe precise legal {{definition}} {{of crimes against}} humanity has always been elusive since their first codification in the IMT Charter in 1945. Jurisprudence applying the definition has reflected the uncertainty {{especially with regard to}} the contextual element that requires that crimes against humanity should be committed pursuant to some form of a policy of a state or organisation: The Policy Element. In the 1990 s the ICTY in its early Decisions exhibited an inclination to broaden the scope of the application of crimes against humanity by downgrading the Policy Element to cover states and non-state actors in asymmetric armed conflicts. In 2002, this tendency culminated in the complete <b>abandonment</b> of the <b>Policy</b> Element requirement. Eminent international criminal law scholars are divided whether the ICTY was correct or not. At the same time, Article 7 (2) (a) of ICC Statute has expressly provided for a downgraded Policy Element that somehow resonates with the ICTY as it covers states and organisations. In 2010, the Situation in the Republic of Kenya presented the ICC with a question whether the concept of organisation in Article 7 (2) (a) of the Statute covers organisations generally or only state-like organisations. The Majority Decision resonated with the more recent jurisprudence of the ICTY and held that it covered all organisations. The Dissenting Opinion, however, restricted the Policy Element to only state-like organisations.
