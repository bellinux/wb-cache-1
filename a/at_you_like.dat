500|$|Although Hirst was a {{right-handed}} batsman, he bowled {{with his}} left arm at medium-fast pace. He {{was one of the}} first bowlers to make the ball swerve through the air in a controlled fashion. According to A. A. Thomson, Hirst's development of swing bowling was almost as revolutionary as Bernard Bosanquet's invention of the googly. His bowling partnership with Rhodes was particularly effective, and established a formidable reputation. Hirst could not make the ball swing in every match, nor could he maintain it through a long innings. However, when he could achieve swerve, even the best batsmen found it almost impossible to bat against him. His success was dependent on atmospheric conditions; for example, he could not swing the ball much in Australia. He was particularly effective when bowling into the wind. Sammy Woods described facing Hirst when the ball was moving in the air: [...] "How the devil can you play a ball that comes in <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> a hard throw-in from cover-point?" [...] Hirst was not an especially quick bowler, [...] a little faster than medium pace, with a long run-up and a relaxed action. He usually bowled over the wicket, meaning he bowled from the right hand side of the wickets and therefore angled the ball across the pitch. After delivery, the ball swung through the air at the last minute and hurried through after pitching, appearing to get faster. A very accurate bowler, he was difficult to score against unless a batsman was prepared to hit him in the air over mid on. The main dangers to the batsmen were the risk of being bowled or hitting the ball with a defensive shot and being caught by specially-placed fielders on the leg side. His ability to make the ball swing made him effective on a variety of pitches. Before Hirst developed his technique, bowlers often rubbed the ball in the dirt to remove the shiny layer of the ball, unaware that this layer helped the ball to swing. Hirst's Wisden obituary records: [...] "Hirst, in fact, has been described as the father of all modern seam and swing bowling." ...|$|E

In its wildness and ecstasy, Xanadu is a welcome relief from the synthetic creations that some Broadway producers have been peddling for years. Here you can’t count the disco balls fast enough—not to mention the roller skates, the frosted-pink lips, and the glittering spandex that the director, Christopher Ashley, hurls <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> a PCP flashback. Xanadu is far sleazier and cheesier than conventional musical theatre, and it points out just how tame most other musicals are." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What does it mean?" [...] {{said the}} girl again. Her face was pink, {{and her eyes were}} {{sparkling}} in the sort of way, don't you know, that makes a fellow feel as if he hadn't any bones in him, if you know what I mean.

The Skye so slow and deliberate, looking up <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> some old gentleman in the club, as much as to say, 'You don't really mean it, do you?' and the Schipperke as quick as a knife.

That stink-cat Muller heard all that I was saying to you, and I tell you he will save it up and save it up, and one day he will bring it all out to the volk, and call me a traitor to the 'land' and ruin me. I know him. He knows how to balance a long stick on his little finger so that the ends keep even. Oh, yes, he can ride two horses at once, and blow hot and blow cold. He is a devil of a man, a devil of a man! And what did he mean by {{swearing}} <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> that? Is it about the missie (girl), I wonder? Almighty! who can say? Ah! that reminds me--though I'm sure I don't know why it should--the Kafirs tell me that there is a big herd of buck--vilderbeeste and blesbok--on my outlying place {{about an hour and a}} half (ten miles) from Mooifontein.

'Well, then, you see,' said Herbert over a hasty mouthful, {{and turning}} again to his victim--'then you see, {{when you were}} just in the pink of {{condition}} to credit any idle tale you heard, then I came in.

I'd listened to your innocent prattle about the child kicking his toes out on death's cupboard door; what more likely thing in the world, then, than that with that moon, in that packed air, I should have swallowed the bait whole, and seen Sabathier in every crevice of your skin? I don't say there wasn't any resemblance; {{it was for the}} moment extraordinary; it was even when you were here the other night distinctly arresting. But now (poor old Grisel, I'm nearly done) all I want to say is this: that if we had the [...] "foxy old roue" [...] here now, and Grisel played Paris between the three of us, she'd hand over the apple not to you but to me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... [November 25-30.][494]--By {{permission}} of the quarantine board we were set at liberty, and lost no time in quitting the dreary fort of Don Manuel, with all its mosquitoes and its thousands of lizards which [stand] shaking their heads <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> their brother in the new Arabian tale of Daft Jock. My son and daughter are already much tired of the imprisonment. I myself cared less about it, but it is unpleasant to be thought so very unclean and capable of poisoning a whole city. We took our guardians' boat and again made a round of the harbour; were met by Mrs. Bathurst's[495] carriage, and carried to my very excellent apartment at Beverley's Hotel. In passing I saw something of the city, and very comical it was; but more of that hereafter. At or about four o'clock we went to our old habitation the Barham, having promised again to dine in the Ward room, where we had a most handsome dinner, and were dismissed at half-past six, after having the pleasure to receive and give a couple hours of satisfaction. I took the boat from the chair, and was a little afraid of the activity of my assistants, but it all went off capitally; went to Beverley's and bed in quiet.|$|E
