Many of Megatron's former generals take turns trying to gain power. Others go rouge, like Overlord as he takes control of the Garrus 9 penal facility and turns it into an extermination camp. A new team of Wreckers is sent by Prowl to retake the prison. They manage, however, at <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>price</b> with most members dead or critically wounded.|$|E
5|$|US losses {{during the}} battle were {{extremely}} light; unusual for fighting {{at a time in}} which other UN offensive forces were paying <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>price</b> when making similar pushes against the North Korean troops. The US infantry forces suffered only five killed and 54 wounded in the 27th Infantry, plus three killed and 16 wounded in the 23rd Infantry. This brought the total American casualty count to 8 dead, 70 wounded. South Korean troops suffered much more heavily during the fight. An estimated 2,300 South Korean men were killed in the fighting; 2,244 enlisted men and 56 officers. However, these losses were not crippling, as volunteers poured in from the surrounding countryside to fight for the South Korean Army.|$|E
5|$|In {{this battle}} {{both sides of}} the {{conflict}} had paid <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>price</b> to achieve their objectives. After the battle, search parties found several hundred VC bodies within small arms range of the Special Forces compound and district headquarters, and another 126 VC bodies inside these compounds. Numerous other Viet Cong casualties had been evacuated or incurred in the fighting beyond the towns borders. In their efforts to recapture the district town of Đồng Xoài, the South Vietnamese military lost 416 soldiers killed in action, 174 wounded and 233 missing. In addition, over one hundred South Vietnamese civilians were believed to have been massacred by the Viet Cong during their brief occupation of the area. Total casualties sustained by U.S. military personnel included 20 soldiers killed or wounded, and 13 missing. According to Vietnam's official account of the Đồng Xoài campaign, the Communists claimed to have put 4,459 enemy soldiers (including 73 Americans) out of action. Furthermore, 1,652 weapons of various kinds were captured, 390 weapons and 60 vehicles were destroyed, 34 aircraft and 3 helicopters were shot down.|$|E

5000|$|There is no ivory {{that is more}} {{desirable}} {{than that of the}} forest elephant. That is due to the facts that ivory that comes from savanna and Asian elephants are softer than the forest elephants. The harder ivory of the forest elephant makes for more enhanced carving and demands <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> <b>price</b> on the black market. This preference is best evident in Japan; this is where harder ivory has nearly monopolized the trade for some time.

5|$|On January 21, 1968, the North Vietnamese 66th Regiment {{began their}} attack on Khe Sanh village, {{seat of the}} local Huong Hoa government. At that time, Khe Sanh village was defended by the South Vietnamese Regional Force 915th Company and the U.S. Marines Combined Action Company Oscar. Throughout the night, the {{combined}} U.S and South Vietnamese forces held their position, but at the first daylight U.S. soldiers on the ground called in air strikes and artillery support from the Khe Sanh Combat Base. Fighting in and around Khe Sanh village continued throughout the day and into the following night, and was finally captured at 09:30 on 22 January. At 11:00am Colonel David Lownds ordered Delta Company, of 1/26th Marines Regiment, to relieve the defenders inside Khe Sanh village, but reversed his orders after second thoughts about North Vietnamese ambushes. Later, the South Vietnamese Regional Force 256th Company was destroyed by the enemies’ 9th Regiment as they marched towards Khe Sanh village. The North Vietnamese 66th Regiment paid <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>price</b> for their victory with 154 killed and 496 wounded.|$|E

25|$|Under Stalin's leadership, the {{government}} launched a planned economy, industrialisation of the largely rural country, and collectivization of its agriculture. During {{this period of}} rapid economic and social change, millions of people were sent to penal labor camps, including many political convicts for their opposition to Stalin's rule; millions were deported and exiled to remote areas of the Soviet Union. The transitional disorganisation of the country's agriculture, combined with the harsh state policies and a drought, led to the Soviet famine of 1932–1933. The Soviet Union, though with <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>price,</b> was transformed from a largely agrarian economy to a major industrial powerhouse in a short span of time.|$|E

Holland reigned supreme within the Republic for the moment, and Holland's commerce was not really damaged {{by the fact that}} England maintained its Navigation Acts (England not being an essential market for the Amsterdam Entrepôt).

25|$|The {{campaign}} {{lasted until}} 10 February 1943, {{when the final}} remaining Australians were evacuated, making them the last Allied land forces to leave South East Asia following the Japanese offensives of 1941–42. As a result, an entire Japanese division was tied up on Timor {{for more than six}} months, preventing its deployment elsewhere. Although Portugal was not a combatant, many East Timorese civilians and Portuguese European colonists fought with the Allies, or provided them with food, shelter and other assistance. Some Timorese continued a resistance campaign following the Australian withdrawal. For this, they paid <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>price</b> {{and tens of thousands of}} Timorese civilians died as a result of the Japanese occupation, which lasted until the end of the war in 1945.|$|E

Faiz Mohammad alone survived the ordeal and was saved by a colleague. The Persian mission in Kabul, under a directive from Reza Shah to do what it could to aid the Shiʿites of Kabul, sent medicines to his house.

Upon his return to Iraq, the Sunni politician was immediately removed from Ahmed Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress Party (INC). In 2005, apparently as payback, a gunmen opened fire on Alusi's car just after it left his house, killing two of his sons, Ayman, 21, and Jamal, 30, while he escaped unharmed. According to Alusi, there is no Iraqi-Israeli problem, {{and the interests of}} the two countries are parallel; thus, he advocates strategic relations between Iraq and Israel against terrorism. Alusi returned to Israel for a second visit in September 2008. Upon his return to Iraq, he was stripped of parliamentary immunity so that he could face charges of traveling illicitly to Israel. Later that year, Iraq's Federal Supreme Court ruled in his favor, maintaining it was no longer a crime for Iraqis to travel to Israel.|$|E
25|$|While {{awaiting}} the long-ballyhooed communist spring offensive, the U.S. improved its forward air control procedures. Lacking the institutional memory to recall prior experience during World War II, the Americans reinvented all-weather bombing and night FAC operations. Newer radio jeeps with 12 channels replaced {{the older ones}} that had only four. Ordnance specialists began loading proximity fused bombs matched to specific targets. Forward airfields were opened to stage aircraft closer to the enemy. When the communist offensive began on 22 April 1951, the 337,000 attacking troops disregarded UN air power and paid <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>price</b> for it. Tactical aviation from three aircraft carriers became available for close air support on 18 May. In mid-May, radar guided night air strikes killed communist troops within 400 yards of the U.S. 2nd Division, to General Almond's delight. However, even with copious air support, the UN forces gave ground until the communist attack petered out. Then they counter-attacked. Although they drove the communists back, {{for the first time}} the latter did not withdraw out of artillery range as usual to regroup, but clung in place. On 1 July 1951, North Korean Premier Kim Il Sung and General Peng Te-huai agreed to a cease fire as both sides settled into fixed positions. As the communists dug in, there were fewer and less worthy targets vulnerable to tactical air strikes.|$|E
