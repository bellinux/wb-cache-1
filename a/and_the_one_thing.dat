2500|$|Almost {{every major}} college program {{recruited}} Marinovich who, {{as a high}} school freshman, began getting letters from Stanford. Despite the family connections to USC he was uncertain whether he fit the program's offense. After a positive visit, however, Marinovich chose the university over recent national champions BYU and Miami, as well as Arizona State, Stanford, and Washington. Marinovich took his college selection seriously, noting: [...] "This is the biggest decision of my life. It means not only where I will play football, but most likely, who I will marry, who my best friends for life will be, and where I will live. It means everything. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I know for sure is I'm too young to make this kind of decision by myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Blasko co-composed the score, with Stefan Gregory (sound designer), for Bell Shakespeare's {{production}} of Hamlet, which ran from June to August. Diana Simmonds of Stage Noise was disappointed by {{an aspect of}} the opening night [...] "ess successful on opening night at least were the songs which open and then punctuate the action, composed and performed by [...] Her face mike and/or the sound balance muddied the lyrics <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> you need in Shakespeare is to hear the words". Whereas Helen Barry of Australian Stage felt Blasko was [...] "truly sublime ... er musical accompaniments add a layer of melancholy rapture to the performance which {{goes to the heart of}} Hamlet's grief, anger and loss. Ingeniously, Blasko is incorporated into the production itself as one of the players, which creates a seamless quality to her musical interludes".|$|E
2500|$|In series 4, episode 12 of The F Word (originally {{aired on}} 29 July 2008), Ramsay visited Ibrox, the home ground of his {{favourite}} childhood team, Rangers, and exclaimed, [...] "Home, Sweet Home" [...] and said, [...] "My dream came true when I was spotted in the mid-80s and I joined the youth team here in Ibrox." [...] He related {{that one of}} his fondest memories is playing alongside one of Scotland's football [...] legends, Ally McCoist, who said about Ramsay, [...] "I remember him well <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that never ever will change is that he's a competitive so-and-so and wants to do and be the best that he can." [...] Ramsay recalled that, [...] "the pain of being released on the back of an injury" [...] was only assuaged many years later, [...] "after receiving [...] third Michelin Star", and concluded that, [...] "without the upset at Ibrox, I would not be the chef I am today." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lexa's {{relationship}} with Clarke {{is presented as}} intense, complex, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that manages to soften Lexa's outlook on life. Debnam-Carey said the characters progression from being allies to becoming romantic [...] "stems from a connection that they both share—which is similar experiences and similar positions" [...] {{in that they are}} [...] "both very young leaders with great authority, a lot of responsibility. They have to lead a huge amount of people. They have a lot of expectations riding on them." [...] She said the sudden responsibilities they faced, the need to make the right decisions, and the fact they both grieved over past lovers helped connect them further, and it is a connection they do not have with others. Rothenberg originally stated that while he would not go as far {{to say that it was}} love at first sight for Lexa, [...] "it definitely was a bit of a thunderbolt moment for her when she first saw Clarke." [...] He said Clarke's attraction to Lexa [...] "developed a little bit more slowly, but by the end [...] they were very much intrigued at the possibility of a romantic relationship." [...] He later said [...] "Lexa was definitely smitten—like love at first sight, probably", but maintained it took longer for Clarke to develop romantic feelings for Lexa.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Rolling Stone {{named him}} the biggest pop {{star of the}} year and {{featured}} him on the magazine's cover, commenting that he [...] "attained the one thing most pop stars don't, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> he wanted more than anything else: credibility." [...] For Entertainment Weekly his second studio album, FutureSex/LoveSounds, [...] "redefined pop's cutting edge"; for Vibe it [...] "pushed boundaries more forcefully" [...] than works by his male contemporaries. Fuse TV's editor Jason Lipshutz stated it [...] "changed the game. [...] was steely and sweaty, a universal dance opus that made room for intimacy. It had the best first half of any pop album in 25 years. You {{have to go back to}} 1979 for Off the Wall, to find a pop album with a first half that matches up." [...] He was ranked 66th on the VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All-Time. Timberlake appeared for the first time on the Time 100 list of most influential people in 2007. In 2013, Timberlake made his second appearance on the 100 list, with Stevie Wonder writing [...] "Justin has accomplished a lot at a young age, taking advantage of all the possibilities, and yet he's found time to give of himself too—he gets and gives back. He has a spirit. He does God's work through using the most of his talent." [...] In October 2015, he was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, becoming its youngest member.|$|E
2500|$|Kim Newman of Empire {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} five stars, saying, [...] "It's no first-rank CGI cartoon, but shows how Pixar's quality over crass is inspiring the mid-list. Fun, with teary bits, for kids; fresh and smart for adults." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film {{two and a half}} stars out of four, saying, [...] "The film throws so much ersatz cleverness and {{overdone}} emotion at the audience that we end up more worn out than entertained." [...] Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of four, saying, [...] "Unfortunately Despicable Me is just, predictably -- eh. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> the larcenous Gru never steals is our heart." [...] Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave the film three out of five stars, saying, [...] "Right now, any excuse for air conditioning will do. So it's a happy bonus to find that Despicable Me is more than just a heat-busting baby-sitter." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three out of four stars, saying, [...] "This is a smartly written comedy with a soft emotional core." [...] Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave the film three out of four stars, saying, [...] "Despicable Me may not be the most sophisticated kids movie ever, but it stacks up against recent animated fare like How To Train Your Dragon the way The New York Review of Books compares to USA Today." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film three out of four stars, saying, [...] "An improbably heartwarming, not to mention visually delightful, diversion." ...|$|E

50|$|Born to a poor {{family in}} Georgia, Rafferty murdered his parents while {{in his late}} teens and framed a {{neighbor}} from the next street, Jasper Washington, for the murders.

6000|$|This {{group of}} Arab Anti-Semites {{may be taken}} next, but very briefly; for the problem itself belongs to a later page; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to be said of it here is very simple.

Both are more or less so; and have formed a sort of alliance out of the fact. The banner carried by the mob bore the Arabic inscription [...] "Moslems and Christians are brothers." [...] It is as if the little wedge of Zionism had closed up the cracks of the Crusades.|$|E

She persistently denied that she was actuated by any warmer feeling toward Mr. Macallan than a feeling of friendly interest. This made it impossible for me to separate them without openly acknowledging my reason for doing so, and thus producing a scandal which might have affected my niece's reputation. My husband was alive at that time; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I could do under the circumstances was the thing I did.

60|$|But Corliss, {{after several}} {{perfunctory}} visits, forgot {{the way which}} led to Jacob Welse's home, and applied himself savagely to his work.

But this was only at times. As a rule, the thought of her made him hungry, in a way akin to physical hunger; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> he found to overcome it was hard work and plenty of it. But even then, what of trail and creek, and camp and survey, he could only get away from her in his waking hours.

60|$|This {{world was}} a school, so he viewed it, for the making of men; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{essential}} to a man was strength.

God needed men to serve Him--to help Him. So, through many changes, through many ages, God gave men life: that by contest and by struggle they might ever increase in strength; to those who proved themselves most fit the sterner task, the humbler beginnings, the greater obstacles. And the crown of well-doing was ever victory. He appeared to have convinced himself {{that he was one of}} the chosen, that he was destined for great ends.
