The considered life cycle costs are: hardware, installation, maintenance, and operating costs for the solar unique components of the total system. The total system takes into consideration long term average environmental conditions, loads, fuel costs, and other economic factors <b>applicable</b> <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> five cities. Selection criteria are based on availability of long term weather data, heating degree days, cold water supply temperature, solar insolation, utility rates, market potential, and type of solar system...|$|E

The notions of commuting, weak commuting, compatible, pointwise R-weak commuting, or weak compatible mappings apply in conditions (i) and (ii) but do not apply in condition (iii). The notion of non-trivial OWC mappings applies in conditions (ii) and (iii) but does not apply in condition (i) as it presupposes {{the existence of a}} coincidence point.

40|$|The Uranium Mill Tailings Remediation Action (UMTRA) Project is {{responsible}} for the assessment and remedial action at the 24 former uranium mill tailings sites located in the US. The surface restoration phase, which includes containment and stabilization of the abandoned uranium mill tailings piles, has a specific termination date and is nearing completion. Therefore, attention has now turned to the groundwater restoration phase, which began in 1991. Regulated constituents in groundwater whose concentrations or activities exceed maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) or background levels at one or more sites include, but are not limited to, uranium, selenium, arsenic, molybdenum, nitrate, gross alpha, radium- 226 and radium- 228. The purpose of this report is to recommend computer codes {{that can be used to}} assist the UMTRA groundwater restoration effort. The report includes a survey <b>of</b> <b>applicable</b> codes <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the following areas: (1) groundwater flow and contaminant transport modeling codes, (2) hydrogeochemical modeling codes, (3) pump and treat optimization codes, and (4) decision support tools. Following the survey of the applicable codes, specific codes that can best meet the needs of the UMTRA groundwater restoration program <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the four areas are recommended...|$|R
40|$|Sea-level {{variability}} {{is characterized}} by multiple interacting factors described in the Fourth Assessment Report (Bindoff et al., 2007) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that act over wide spectra of temporal and spatial scales. In Church et al. (2010) sea-level variability and changes are defined as manifestations of climate variability and change. The European Environmental Agency (EEA) defines sea level as one of most important indicators for monitoring climate change, as it integrates the response of different components of the Earths system and is also affected by anthropogenic contributions (EEA, 2011). The balance between the different sea-level contributions represents {{an important source of}} uncertainty, involving stochastic processes that are very difficult to describe and understand in detail, {{to the point that they}} are defined as an enigma in Munk (2002). Sea-level rate estimates are affected by all these uncertainties, in particular if we look at possible responses to sea-level contributions to future climate. At the regional scale, lateral fluxes also contribute to sea-level variability, adding complexity to sea-level dynamics. The research strategy adopted in this work to approach such an interesting and challenging topic has been to develop an objective methodology to study sea-level variability at different temporal and spatial scales, <b>applicable</b> <b>in</b> <b>each</b> part <b>of</b> the Mediterranean basin in particular, and in the global ocean in general, using all the best calibrated sources of data (for the Mediterranean) : in-situ, remote-sensig and numerical models data. The global objective of this work was to achieve a deep understanding of all of the components of the sea-level signal contributing to sea-level variability, tendency and trend and to quantify them...|$|R

When it attaches to political discourse and goes uncriticised, it is sometimes seen as being greatly inappropriate and even dangerous. Thus, {{there is a strong}} emphasis on the historical and contextual considerations, and a 'reflection on what is happening on the ground' in the actual process of reconciliation.|$|R
40|$|Refactoring {{is about}} {{changing}} the design of existing code without changing its behaviour, but {{with the aim of}} making code easier to understand, modify, or reuse. Taking Haskell and Erlang as examples, we investigate the application of refactoring techniques to functional programs, and building tools for supporting interactive refactoring. Although both Haskell and Erlang are general-purpose functional programming languages, they have many differences in their language design and programming idioms. As a result, program refactoring in the two languages has much in common, but also considerable differences. This paper makes this comparison, and in particular looks in more detail at the refactorings <b>applicable</b> <b>in</b> <b>each</b> language, the program analysis required by typical refactorings, and at tool support for refactoring Haskell and Erlang programs. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWhen the {{explosion}} of condensed materials occurs in a tunnel, the subsequent blast wave reveals two patterns. The region close to the explosive charge exhibits a free-field overpressure decay pattern and the region far from {{the explosion}}, which undergoes much less overpressure decay, exhibits a quasi-one-dimensional pattern. Well-known overpressure decay laws that are <b>applicable</b> <b>in</b> <b>each</b> region already exist. In order to assess the validity range <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> these laws, the blast wave clue an explosion inside a typical confined geometry is examined {{in order to determine}} the position of the transition zone from the free pattern to the one-dimensional pattern. To this end, the detonation of different quantities of explosive charges was simulated inside a tunnel with a constant cross-sectional area, and the wave aspect was determined for each region. This paper proposes a correlation law that defines the transition distance according to the explosive charge's weight and material and the geometry of the propagating domain. The validity of the proposed correlation law is corroborated by experimental results. In the authors' opinion, this law may be helpful for rapidly and efficiently drawing up the blast wave damage map...|$|R
