5000|$|Photo CD images use three {{forms of}} {{compression}} {{in order to}} reduce image storage requirements. Firstly, chroma subsampling reduces the size of the images by approximately 50%. This subsampling is by a factor of 4 for 4Base images, and a factor of 2 for <b>all</b> <b>other</b> <b>resolutions.</b> Secondly an additional reduction in size is achieved by decomposing the highest-resolution image data, and storing the 4Base, 16Base and 64Base components as residuals (differences from pixels at the previous level of resolution). Thirdly and finally, the Photo CD system employs a form of quantization and Huffman coding to further compress this residual data. This Huffman encoding is performed on an image-row-by-image-row basis. The Huffman tables are encoded into the Photo CD image itself, and have different lengths depending on the compression class. These classes are: ...|$|E

50|$|Characterized by {{an active}} concern for both pro-social and pro-self behavior, the cooperation, integration, {{confrontation}} or problem-solving conflict style is typically used {{when an individual}} has elevated interests in their own outcomes {{as well as in}} the outcomes of others. During conflict, cooperators collaborate with others in an effort to find an amicable solution that satisfies all parties involved in the conflict. Individuals using this type of conflict style tend to be both highly assertive and highly empathetic. By seeing conflict as a creative opportunity, collaborators willingly invest time and resources into finding a “win-win” solution. According to the literature on conflict resolution, a cooperative conflict resolution style is recommended above <b>all</b> <b>others.</b> This <b>resolution</b> may be achieved by lowering the aggressors guard whilst raising the ego.|$|R

40|$|United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, {{passed in}} the wake of the Six-Day War in 1967, is one of the body 2 ̆ 7 s most famous decisions. The {{resolution}} called for “[w]ithdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict. ” The meaning of this provision [...] in particular, the extent of the required withdrawal [...] has been contested ever since. This Article presents new evidence on Resolution 2422 ̆ 7 s meaning, adding two important but previously unexamined lines of evidence that bear on its interpretation. It compares the resolution 2 ̆ 7 s withdrawal provision to <b>all</b> <b>other</b> such territorial demands issued by the Security Council. The marked difference that emerges between Resolution 2422 ̆ 7 s wording and that of <b>all</b> <b>other</b> such <b>resolutions</b> suggests the former was a meaningful and substantive drafting choice. The Article then sheds further light on the preamble 2 ̆ 7 s reference to the “inadmissibility” of conquest by examining original understandings of the U. N. Charter. International jurists of the post-World War II era believed the Charter prohibited territorial changes as a result of war but only with significant limitations and exceptions. The new evidence presented here supports the view that Resolution 242 contemplates only a partial Israeli withdrawal. This understanding is particularly relevant to current suggestions to “update” Resolution 242 by a new Security Council resolution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The recent {{development}} of the CMOS active pixel sensor (APS) has, for the first time, pennitted large scale integration of supporting circuitry and smart camera functions on the same chip as a high-performance image sensor. This paper reports on the demonstration of a new 128 x 128 CMOS APS with programmable multiresolution readout capability. By placing signal processing circuitry on the imaging focal plane, the image sensor can output data at varying resolutions which can decrease the computational load of downstream image processing. For instance, software intensive image pyramid reconstruction can be eliminated. The circuit uses a passive switched capacitor network to average arbitrarily large neighborhoods of pixels which can then be read out at any user-defined resolution by configuring a set of digital shift registers. The full resolution frame rate is 30 Hz with higher rates for <b>all</b> <b>other</b> image <b>resolutions.</b> The sensor achieved 80 dB of dynamic range while dissipating only 5 mW of power. Circuit error was less than- 34 dB and introduced no objectionable fixed pattern noise or other artifacts into the image.

40|$|Representative {{parameters}} of the scan geometry are empirically determined for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI). Effective fields of view (EFOVs) are computed for the GMI's 13 channels, {{taking into account the}} blurring effect of the measurement interval on the instantaneous fields of view (IFOVs). Using a Backus–Gilbert procedure, coefficients are derived that yield an approximate spatial match between synthetic EFOVs of different channels, using the 18. 7  GHz channels as a target and with due consideration of the tradeoff between the quality of the fit and noise amplification and edge effects. Modest improvement in resolution is achieved for the 10. 65  GHz channels, albeit with slight ringing in the vicinity of coastlines and other sharp brightness temperature gradients. For <b>all</b> <b>other</b> channels, <b>resolution</b> is coarsened to approximate the 18. 7  GHz EFOV. It is shown that the resolution matching procedure reduces nonlinear correlations between channels in the presence of coastlines as well as enables the more efficient separation of large brightness temperature variations due to coastlines from the much smaller variations due to other geophysical variables. As a byproduct of this work, we report accurate EFOV resolutions as well as a self-consistent set of parameters for modeling the scan geometry of the GMI...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{analyze the}} {{indications}} and outcome of laparoscopic nephrectomy for benign non-functioning kidneys in children. Materials and Methods: The data of all patients operated over a 10 year period was retrospectively analyzed. Results: There were 56 children, aged 4 months to 12 {{years with a}} male: female ratio of 2. 3 : 1. The most common presentation in boys and girls was urinary tract infection (UTI) (61. 5 % and 47. 05 % respectively). Incontinence due to ectopic ureter was a close second in girls (41. 17 %). The most common underlying conditions were vesico-ureteric reflux (42. 85 %) and multicystic dysplastic kidney (23. 2 %). There were 6 nephrectomies, 4 heminephroureterectomies and the remaining nephroureterectomies. All children tolerated the surgery well. One patient underwent a concomitant cholecystectomy. The post-operative problems encountered were UTI (1), urine retention (1), pyonephrosis in the opposite kidney and development of contra-lateral reflux (1). <b>All</b> <b>others</b> had <b>resolution</b> of pre-operative symptoms with good cosmesis. Conclusions: As per available literature, {{this appears to be}} the largest Indian series of pediatric laparoscopic nephrectomies for benign non-functioning kidneys. Laparoscopic approach gives excellent results provided pre-operative investigations rule out other causes for the symptoms with which the patient presents. Often it is not the kidney but the dilated dysplastic ureter which is the seat of stasis and infection or pain and therefore should be completely removed...|$|R
