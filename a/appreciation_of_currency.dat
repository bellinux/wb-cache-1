In contrast, highly dollarized economies experience a negative response of output in response to increases in government spending. This suggests that fear of fu- ture depreciation of currency in highly dollarized economies stifles the response in output from fiscal stimulus...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the global}} trade {{imbalance}} narrowed {{during the current}} economic recession, the improvement is not evenly distributed across different regions. While many economists blame the US trade deficit to the undervaluation <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> in emerging Asia in general, and to the undervalued Chinese RMB in particular, no consensus has been reached as yet. Since a unilateral revaluation of the RMB has failed to reduce the trade deficit in the US, some commentators have recommended a joint <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> in the emerging Asia as an instrument to restore trade balance between the US and Asia. Based on several simulation exercises on a multi-country macro-econometric model (the Fair model), this paper examines the likely consequence <b>of</b> the joint <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> the emerging Asian currencies on the trade deficit in the US. According {{to the results of}} simulations, neither a drastic unilateral <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> the RMB, nor a joint <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> in emerging Asia, would reduce the trade deficit in US significantly...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} countries, mostly small and island economies manage fixed {{exchange}} and often devalue it as a stabilisation strategy. The current paper investigates {{the effectiveness of}} devaluation in improving trade balance with reference to Fiji. A small island economy has limited exportable and hence highly depends on imports for both consumption and production purposes. A devaluation, therefore, inflates domestic price and appreciates the real exchange immediately by raising importable consumption and discouraging imports used in domestic production. The paper applies various econometric models for empirical investigation of its impact and transmission mechanism. Strong long-run relationship found between real exchange rate and trade balance explains that <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> {{has been responsible for}} the rising trade deficit in the economy. Moreover, the devaluation did not demonstrate J-curve phenomenon. The effect of devaluation strongly contributed to the domestic inflation has been while quite weak on stimulating aggregate demand...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} trends and varying types of {{industrial}} restructuring in Taiwan are examined as the island continues to lose comparative advantage in international markets.

There {{is evidence of}} specific triggers of industrial restructuring which include shortage of labor, rising domestic real wages, <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> value, increasing raw-material costs, and labor productivity changes. The author addresses corporate strategies {{both at home and}} abroad, with emphases upon the issues of hiring illegal foreign workers and the operating of outward investment. The government has {{played a major role in}} policy responses as reflected in efforts to expand domestic demand, diversify export markets, and revise mercantilist trade regulations.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of the United States' (US) {{quantitative}} easing on Asia by examining capital flows and financial markets. After the global financial crisis, Asian economies with more open and developed capital markets experienced greater swings in capital inflows. In particular, large capital flows were manifest more in portfolio investment and other investment such as bank loans than in foreign direct investment. Empirical analysis shows quantitative easing, in particular the first round, significantly contributed to the rebounding of capital inflows to the region after the onset of the crisis by lowering domestic yield rates as well as credit default swap premiums. Although the currency value responses differed across countries, it appears that economies with stable exchange rates roughly coincide with those in which housing prices have been rising, suggesting that monetary easing of advanced countries have affected Asian countries through either <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> values or increases in the prices of housing...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the export, import, and total trade {{determinants}} using reduced form equations for six Pacific Island countries (PICs) with an institutional focus. Design/methodology/approach – A fixed effects model, controlling for AR(1) errors, using panel data for selected PICs is utilized. Controlling for common determinants of trade, four indicators of institutional quality: government effectiveness; rule of law; regulatory quality; and control of corruption are tested. Findings – The empirical results indicate that improvements in institutional quality variables matter for improved levels of trade. The results also provide confirmation that the <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> does not significantly harm trade; higher levels of technological diffusion are vital for improved trade; and that gradual liberalization of trade through tariff reduction strongly facilitates more trade. Practical implications – This study clearly points out that the institutional quality in the selected countries is a significant factor in determining the level of trade. Originality/value – This paper expresses the view that institutions matter for enhanced trade. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a situation in}} which n firms located in market l and m firms located in market 2 each sell a commodity which is homogeneous within each market but may differ between markets.

When these markets are independent on the cost side (constant marginal costs) and demands are linear, a {{reduction in the number of}} firms (which might result from a merger) in market 1 increases the pass-through (of an <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> 2) in market 1 and decreases the pass-through in market 2. A similar occurrence in market 2 has the opposite effect. We give conditions under which, with identical economies of scope linking the markets, the sign of the price changes will be reversed when the number of foreign firms is small enough compared to the number of local firms. However, such sign reversals cannot occur in the two markets simultaneously...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAustralia has {{experienced}} several episodes of mining boom in its economy. Studies {{on the impact}} of mining booms on the economic growth and development indicates that, mining boom either through rise in commodity prices or mining investment tend to result in <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> thus harming the manufacturing and other sectors in the economy, while the overall gross domestic product increases and this is termed Dutch Disease. The aim of this work is to investigate the dynamic relationship between mining GDP, manufacturing GDP, service GDP and exchange-rate using vector autoregressive (VAR) approach consisting of impulse response function (IRF), variance decomposition (VDC) and VAR Granger Causality. Using annual data for the sample period 1975 - 2013 sourced from Australian Bureau of Statistics, we find mixed evidence presented by the IRF, while the VDC reveal that mining sector {{have an impact on the}} exchange rate. The results also suggest that mining GDP contribute to the variation in the service sector. VAR Granger causality suggest that exchange rate granger cause manufacturing and that mining granger cause services sector. The study concludes by suggesting promotion of international competitiveness in other sectors such as manufacturing and tourism, to also promote innovation and technical know-how to help avoid Dutch Disease effects that can turn mining boom into a resource curse...|$|E

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} exchange rate changes on German ex-port and import prices. The analytical framework is a mark-up model {{which is based on}} the assumption that the markets under consideration are imperfectly competitive as well as segmented.

The mark-up is not fixed, but can be adjusted in response to demand pressure and competitive pressure in the relevant mar-ket. Consequently, firms can practice price discrimination.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, China’s trade with Africa {{increased}} faster than its overall foreign trade. This article focusses {{on the role}} of real exchange rates in this growth. A ‘bilateral real exchange rate’ augmented trade gravity model applied to China’s trade with 49 African countries over the period 2000 – 2011 shows that the real <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> most African <b>currencies</b> relative to the renminbi favoured China’s exports to these countries, but had no impact on China’s imports from Africa. This real <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> African <b>currencies</b> is explained by three main factors: the decision to peg themto other currencies (in particular to the euro), the amount of export of raw materials from African countries and the amount of financial assistance from international donors including China. Thus, a kind of detrimental sequence exists in Africa’s relationship with China: China’s imports of raw materials and its economic co-operation are among the factors explaining the <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> African real exchange rates, which itself stimulates China’s exports of manufactured goods, and so restricts Africa’s own industrial development...|$|R
