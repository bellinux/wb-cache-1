30|$|The idea of coded-cooperative {{diversity}} {{was first}} introduced in [9]. In order to achieve the coded-cooperative diversity, many distributed coding schemes {{have been reported in}} the literature such as the convolutional codes [10, 11], distributed space-time coding [12, 13], distributed low-density parity-check codes (D-LDPC) [14, 15] and distributed turbo codes (DTC) [16, 17] and more recently the polar codes [18, 19]. However, the BER performance of binary turbo and the LDPC codes largely depends on the <b>information</b> <b>block</b> size, the longer the better and vice versa, whereas for the short non-binary turbo and LDPC codes, reasonable performances under the iterative decoding are reported in [20, 21]. In many existing and emerging applications (such as device-to-device and sensor networks), it is possible to have scenarios, which may transmit small <b>information</b> <b>block</b> size. Thus, it provides one of the many motivations for our work to develop such a coded-cooperative scheme, which may be useful particularly for <b>applications</b> having small <b>information</b> <b>block</b> size and require low encoding and decoding complexity. For any communication system, there is and always will be a trade-off between the complexity and performance as suggested in [22].|$|R
3000|$|The two {{considered}} LDPC {{codes are}} described in detail in [16]. The first code has <b>information</b> <b>block</b> length k= 64 bits and codeword length n= 128 bits.

3000|$|If relays discard any useful information, {{they have}} to tell the {{destination}} which bits are discarded. Thus, the relays must add extra location information. The additional information is done in the complex field [6].The number of additional location information for each <b>information</b> <b>block</b> is ⌈log 2 (N)⌉ bits; thus, the number of location information bits, which is required by the relay to send N_r_i <b>information</b> <b>blocks,</b> is _ 2 (N)N(1 -BER_sr_i) [...].|$|R

5000|$|Instead of FS segment {{descriptor}} on x86 {{versions of}} the Windows NT family, GS segment descriptor is used to point to two operating system defined structures: Thread <b>Information</b> <b>Block</b> (NT_TIB) in user mode and Processor Control Region (KPCR) in kernel mode. Thus, for example, in user mode GS:0 is {{the address of the}} first member of the Thread <b>Information</b> <b>Block.</b> Maintaining this convention made the x86-64 port easier, but required AMD to retain the function of the FS and GS segments in long mode — even though segmented addressing per se is not really used by any modern operating system.|$|R

40|$|The multifold turbo coding, {{designed}} to provide multiple extrinsic estimates and LLRs on a bit basis during decoding iterations, is introduced. Component encoders accept various combinations of information segments, which are obtained by equally dividing the <b>information</b> <b>block</b> prior to encoding. Grouped segments are then interleaved and encoded separately, while the <b>information</b> <b>block</b> is left uncoded. This novel sectionalization of the information sequence, combined with separate interleaving and encoding, bring the weight distribution closer to the binomial distribution of a random code.

40|$|The {{scientific}} computing matrix library (SCMAT) is a C++ {{class library}} for representing and manipulating rectangular, symmetric, and diagonal matrices and vectors. It {{is founded on}} an abstract base classes {{for each of these}} types of matrices; these are specialized to concrete matrix classes well suited for particular computational environments. The local matrix specializations (MS) do no communication. All elements reside on each node and all computations are duplicated on each node. The replicated MS hold all of the elements on each node, however do some communication in order to reduce computation time. The distributed MS spread the elements across all the nodes and thus require less storage than local matrices however these use more communication than replicated matrices. The blocked MS are used to implement point group symmetry. One of the other MS is used to hold the diagonal subblocks of a matrix. The offdiagonal subblocks are known to be zero and not stored, resulting in considerable savings in storage and computation for those cases where it applies. A variety of supporting classes is also provided. There is a dimension class that optionally contains <b>application</b> specific <b>blocking</b> <b>information</b> as well as the matrix dimension. Classes to assist in iterating through the elements of a matrix are available. Finally, a class is provided which acts as a class factory by returning mutually consistent MS...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the BER {{performance}} of a parallel concatenated turbo-code improves roughly as 1 /N, where N is the <b>information</b> <b>block</b> length. However, it has been observed by Benedetto and Montorsi that for most parallel concatenated turbo-codes, the FER performance does not improve monotonically with N. In this report, we study the FER of turbo-codes, and the effects of their concatenation with an outer code. Two methods of concatenation are investigated: across several frames and within each frame. Some asymmetric codes are shown to have excellent FER performance with an <b>information</b> <b>block</b> length of 16384. We also show that the proposed outer coding schemes can improve the BER performance as well by eliminating pathological frames generated by the iterative MAP decoding process...|$|R
