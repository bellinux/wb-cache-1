50|$|The {{game has}} been criticised for the danger it poses to participants.

5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals {{he wanted to do}} it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.|$|E

5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person {{will be willing to}} pay anything for a good if the alternative is death. For example, a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet, no matter how much, for <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on the price.|$|E
5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in {{the early}} evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his parents would be worried about him being out so late. With the added inducement of <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> sherry, Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they would have to make a detour to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E

Afterwards, Yusef admits to Zainab that he has great {{feelings}} for her but they should maintain some distance as she is married.

Zainab passes out and is hospitalised, with her family believing she took a deliberate overdose, as was Yusef's plan.
