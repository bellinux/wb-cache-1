German bombers focused their attacks on strategic points, such as the railway line in the Lille suburb of Lambersart. The German army advanced rapidly, occupying Luxembourg and Belgium before eventually reaching Lille on May 27. After three panzer divisions attacked from west of the Deûle river, French and British soldiers withdrew from the city, leaving only a few pioneer regiment units, eighty <b>administrative</b> <b>clerks,</b> and a thousand Senegalese soldiers entrenched in the Citadel of Lille. Though otherwise ill-equipped, the Senegalese regiment's armored vehicles allowed them to resist the siege for four days.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the risk of hearing loss among workers exposed to both toluene and noise. We recruited 58 workers at an adhesive materials manufacturing plant who were exposured to both toluene and noise [78. 6 – 87. 1 A-weighted decibels; dB(A) ], 58 workers exposed to noise only [83. 5 – 90. 1 dB(A) ], and 58 <b>administrative</b> <b>clerks</b> [67. 9 – 72. 6 dB(A) ] at the same company. We interviewed participants to obtain sociodemographic and employment information and performed physical examinations, including pure-tone audiometry tests between 0. 5 and 6 kHz. A contracted laboratory certified by the Council of Labor in Taiwan conducted on-site toluene and noise exposure measurements. The prevalence of hearing loss of ≥ 25 dB in the toluene plus noise group (86. 2 %) was much greater than that in the noise-only group (44. 8 %) and the <b>administrative</b> <b>clerks</b> (5. 0 %) (p < 0. 001). The prevalence rates were 67. 2, 32. 8, and 8. 3 % (p < 0. 001), respectively, when 0. 5 kHz was excluded from the estimation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the toluene plus noise group had an estimated risk for hearing loss ≥ 25 dB, 10. 9 times {{higher than that of}} the noise–only group. The risk ratio dropped to 5. 8 when 0. 5 kHz was excluded from the risk estimation. Hearing impairment was greater for the pure-tone frequency of 1 kHz than for that of 2 kHz. However, the mean hearing threshold was the poorest for 6 kHz, and the least effect was observed for 2 kHz. Our results suggest that toluene exacerbates hearing loss in a noisy environment, with the main impact on the lower frequencies...|$|R

(After the purge of ‘bourgeois’ officers, the newly commissioned substitutes of working-class origin needed, owing to their lack of competence, the unofficial but tolerated help of educated soldiers who for political reasons were not deemed fit for officer’s training. After his military service Werner did not get his previous job back, but was transferred, in a similar capacity, to the headquarters of the nationalised enterprise overseeing restaurants and canteens. A year later (1955) he lost even this job to a communist party member and after a short training period worked as a restaurant manager (1956-60).|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAll organizations, {{both private and}} public, must improve, streamline, and automate their business practices to adjust to rigorous demands of a highly volatile marketplace, austere financial resources, and manpower reductions. This thesis analyzes the potential of business process reengineering (BPR) to dramatically improve the Military Pay Document Process (MPDP) for the United States Army and the United States Coast Guard financial communities. Based on Nissen's methodology the MPDP is analyzed and three redesign alternatives are developed, which are capable of yielding order of magnitude improvements in cycle time and cost. This thesis includes process simulation and intelligent systems analysis of the Army and Coast Guard's baseline MPDP to generate and evaluate the three redesign alternatives. Simulation runs demonstrate that cycle time and cost can be reduced substantially by redesigning the MPDP. The redesign alternatives take a comprehensive look at transformation enablers and information technology (IT) capable of eliminating the Personnel <b>Administrative</b> <b>Clerks</b> (PAC) and the finance office functions as they pertain to pay transaction processing. The research concludes that the Army and Coast Guard's MPDP can be dramatically improved by eliminating middlemen functions (PAC and finance office) and shortening the value chain using IT along with other transformation enablers[URL] United States Army.

The aims of the chapter is to show how this AFCC framework can serve to local actors to pursue their own objectives, {{even if they have}} a little or poor knowledge of what AFCC might produce. The first section recalls the presence of the ‘municipality advisory councils of seniors’ (Conseils consultatifs communaux des aînés or CCCA) as a form of pre-existing seniors’ social participation, i. e. before the AFC experiment. It then explains how the WHO’s framework has been selectively adopted by regional public policy in 2012 - 2013. After the presentation of our research method in second section, the third part of the chapter presents empirical data’s: first, it explores the diversity of profiles and experiences of the three types of local actors implied into the processes (elected politicians, senior citizen representatives and administration clerks, the last one might be equivalent to “project management officer” in AFCC); second, it shows how problematic is the use and reference to the assessment of needs and resources of seniors at local level by such actors; third, it presents the central role of the local <b>administrative</b> <b>clerks</b> to give a certain coherence to the senior’s social participation in practice. In conclusion, the chapter lays the milestones of a more realistic use of the AFC framework by discussing the need to better articulate it to existing practices such as the CCCA or recent experiences of ‘participatory diagnostics’...|$|R
