25|$|The {{site has}} diverse <b>aquatic</b> <b>flora</b> and invertebrates, and the {{submerged}} plants {{are of particular}} interest. These include mare's tail, spiked water-milfoil and perfoliate pondweed. Nine species of dragonfly have been recorded, {{and there are also}} water shrews and the nationally rare water beetle haliplus mucronatus.|$|E
25|$|The river zone {{also faces}} {{the problem of}} {{industrial}} pollution and forcible occupation of land by people. Arresting environmental hazards resulting from lack of sanitation facilities, encroachment, groundwater contamination like arsenic pollution, destruction of <b>aquatic</b> <b>flora,</b> fauna {{are some of the}} burning problem of the areas that needs to be tackled through participatory mechanism.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} <b>aquatic</b> <b>floras</b> in the lakes and ponds, and along the river shores. The invasive water hyacinth is very common, often choking the water bodies, but it is cleared during destructive floods. Another invasive species, Mimosa invisa, which is toxic to herbivores, was cleared by Kaziranga staff {{with help from the}} Wildlife Trust of India in 2005.|$|R
40|$|Sampling of the <b>aquatic</b> {{vascular}} <b>flora</b> of the Chingaza National Natural Park (Colombia) {{allowed the}} initial taxonomic {{description of the}} Potamogetonaceae, Potamogeton paramoanus Haynes & Holm-Nielsen and P. illinoensis Morong found {{in the area of}} study. Descriptions of the family, genus, keys, illustrations and general notes on their distribution and ecology are given...|$|R
50|$|Stream {{restoration}} and conservation projects are proceeding to return/enhance migrating {{fish in the}} Salmonidae family, such as the steelhead trout, and other <b>aquatic</b> and terrestrial <b>flora</b> and fauna to the Carmel River ecosystem.|$|R
25|$|The {{specific}} contaminants {{leading to}} pollution in water include {{a wide spectrum}} of chemicals, pathogens, and physical changes such as elevated temperature and discoloration. While many of the chemicals and substances that are regulated may be naturally occurring (calcium, sodium, iron, manganese, etc.) the concentration is often the key in determining what is a natural component of water and what is a contaminant. High concentrations of naturally occurring substances can have negative impacts on <b>aquatic</b> <b>flora</b> and fauna.|$|E
2500|$|Chinampa {{agriculture}} {{would be}} important {{in many areas of}} the Valley of Mexico, including the area of Iztapalapa. Chinampas here were made from reeds, tree branches and lake mud, [...] growing corn, beans and wide variety of vegetables. These chinampas, now known as neighborhoods called Tezontitla, El Bordo, El Moral, Las Largas, Las Cuadradas, Tecorrales, Zapotla and others were separated by small canals and some of them had docks. They were also an ecosystem home to wide variety of land and <b>aquatic</b> <b>flora</b> and fauna, including storks, flowers, trees, reeds, quetzals, frogs, and fish. The chinampas remained in private hands until 1970, when they were expropriated to construct the Central de Abasto, which eliminated them.|$|E
2500|$|Submerged macrophytic {{vascular}} {{plants are}} mostly absent, except in some shallow bays along {{the shores of}} Lake Baikal. More than 85 species of submerged macrophytes have been recorded, including genera such as Ceratophyllum, Myriophyllum, Potamogeton and Sparganium. The invasive species Elodea canadensis {{was introduced to the}} lake in the 1950s. Instead of vascular plants, <b>aquatic</b> <b>flora</b> is often dominated by several green algae species, notably Draparnaldioides, Tetraspora and Ulothrix in water shallower than , although Aegagrophila, Cladophora and Draparnaldioides may occur deeper than [...] Except for Ulothrix, there are endemic Baikal species in all these green algae genera. More than 400 diatom species, both benthic and planktonic, are found in the lake and about half of these are endemic to Baikal; however significant taxonomic uncertainties remain for this group.|$|E
40|$|More than 100 {{species of}} aquatic plants grow in Nebraska. Some are entirely submersed for their whole lives, others produce {{floating}} leaves and flowers, {{and still others}} stand upright, with only their lower stems in water. Examples of these are shown here in this publication. Vigorous and diverse colonies of aquatic plants are usually a sign of healthy and stable aquatic environments. In fact, the plants themselves stabilize the shorelines, underwater soils, and water chemistry. Waters rich with aquatic plants are rich with aquatic animals and waterfowl, which find cover, breeding habitat, and abundant food. Non-alkaline waters have more aquatic plants than alkaline waters but, {{in the absence of}} pollution, both waters have stable communities. However, excessive nutrients from pollution by sewage and runoff from cropfields stimulate rampant growth by a few species that overwhelm the others, leading to decreases in aquatic plant and animal species. Most Sandhills waters are unpolluted and their <b>aquatic</b> <b>floras</b> are stable, {{but that is not the}} case for many streams and reservoirs elsewhere in the state...|$|R
5|$|Many river pools {{which are}} an {{important}} summer refuge and habitat for <b>aquatic</b> and terrestrial <b>flora</b> and fauna have been lost due to sedimentation and modification of the flow regime caused by impoundments in the Canning River.|$|R
50|$|The various pits support varied <b>aquatic</b> and marinal <b>flora</b> {{including}} the nationally scarce whorled water milfoil. Other species include the fan- leaved water crowfoot, flowering rush, lesser reedmace, frogbit, blunt-leaved pondweed, lesser pondweed and the brown sedge.|$|R

40|$|Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl {{substances}} (PFASs) {{are found}} in <b>aquatic</b> systems, <b>flora,</b> and fauna worldwide. These potentially harmful compounds are also frequently detected in Sweden and have already resulted in severe problems for public drinking water supply, i. e., some wells had to be closed due to high PFAS concentrations both in raw water and produced drinking water. Knowledge on PFAS occurrence in Sweden is still quite low, although monitoring is currently ongoing. This work describes potential sources for PFASs to enter the drinking water supply in Sweden and compares different occurrences of PFASs in raw and drinking water in the country. Moreover, the monitoring history, the legal situation, and remediation actions taken are presented. Finally, future challenges and the way forward in Sweden are discussed...|$|R

50|$|The {{trademark}} of KDCFP is an artificial lake. The lake {{was created in}} early 2000s due to {{the building of a}} road that blocked a small stream that flows through the park. This has introduced <b>aquatic</b> <b>flora</b> and fauna attributable to slow-flowing water body to the area.|$|E
30|$|Water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms., is a {{floating}} aquatic plant native to Brazil. This species is an invasive weed in numerous freshwater ecosystems between 40 °N and 40 °S worldwide. Water hyacinth is fast-growing and often forms dense mats on lakes, rivers, and waterways. Rapid, uncontrolled proliferation of water hyacinth adversely affects <b>aquatic</b> fauna and <b>flora,</b> impacting local biodiversity seriously. Colonisation of water bodies by water hyacinth poses problems to human activities, such as agriculture, recreation, power generation and transportation (Malik, 2007).|$|R
40|$|The aquatic hyphomycetes are a {{group of}} world-wide {{distributed}} fungi (Moniliales, Fungi Imperfecti) which are present in running waters. The group was recognized by Ingold (1942) from a stream in Leicestershire, England on submerged leaves of Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaerth. He reported sixteen species. Since then this group of fungi {{has been found to}} be present in leaves, branches and twigs of different dicotyledonous plants;The Iowa <b>aquatic</b> hyphomycete <b>flora</b> has been known from only one survey conducted by Dyko in 1971 - 1972 at four aquatic sites in central Iowa (Dyko, 1973). The present study is a survey of aquatic hyphomycetes in two different kinds of aquatic sites in Iowa, including the northeast part of the state which has not been surveyed. The muddy streams and rivers in central Iowa could be quite different habitats from those flowing over limestone in the northeast part of the state;Eighteen species were collected during this study. Seven of these, Anguillospora gigantea Ranzoni, Articulospora tetracladia Ingold, Clavariopsis aquatica De Wildeman, Heliscus lugdunensis Saccardo 2 ̆ 6 Therry, Lemonniera pseudofloscula Dyko, Lunulospora curvula Ingold, Sigmoidea prolifica Crane and Varicosporium elodeae Kegel, have not been previously reported as occurring in Iowa. Ten other species were previously reported in the state. Four species, Anguillospora gigantea Ranzoni, Articulospora tetracladia Ingold, Sigmoidea prolifica Crane and Varicosporium elodeae Kegel, were collected only in the northeast portion of the state;The observation of Clavariopsis aquatica De Wildeman, Heliscus lugdunensis Saccardo 2 ̆ 6 Therry, Lemonniera pseudofloscula Dyko, Lunulospora curvula Ingold, and the absence of Centrospora curvula and Lemonniera aquatica, are the major differences in species composition of the <b>aquatic</b> hyphomycete <b>flora</b> of central Iowa as determined in Dyko 2 ̆ 7 s 1971 - 1972 investigation and the present study;References;Dyko, B.

50|$|The {{main body}} of water {{supports}} many resident and wintering wildfowl: Moorhen, Coot, Mallard and Little Grebe and Great Crested Grebes regularly breed. The surrounding habits provide nesting sites. There is a significant <b>aquatic</b> and grassland <b>flora</b> including grassland supporting Common Spotted Orchid, Pyramidal Orchid and Cowslip. The reservoir is a major spawning ground for the Common Toad and there are signs which are opened each year at migration time on the A40 which runs alongside the reservoir. There are two toads tunnels from {{the south side of}} the A40 into the reservoir grassland.|$|R
