40|$|To {{the memory}} of Dr. Dr. h. c. mult. Adolf Budenandt Summary: Purified {{antibodies}} to human serum albumin or to human γ-globulin were used to study the direct influence of some antirheumatic drugs on the formation and disruption of immunoprecipitates. 125 I-labelled human serum albumin and 125 I-labelled human IgG served as indicators. The effects of the following drugs were described: diclofenac, monophenylbutazone, diphenylbutazone, ibuprofen, and metamizol. At approximately therapeutic con-centrations, the <b>antirheumatics</b> inhibited the formation of complexes of homologous antibodies with human serum albumin and, surprisingly, with human IgG. When the antigens were precipitated with antibodies, subsequent addi-tion of the <b>antirheumatics</b> to the preformed immunoprecipitates caused disruption of [125 I]human serum albumin-anti-human serum albumin precipitates but practically no disruption of human [125 I]IgG-anti-human IgG precipi-tates. These new findings may be of relevance for clinical diagnosis and therapy {{as well as for}} research in immuno-chemistry. It is conceivable that, in patients, antirheumatic or other drugs might interfere with immunological determinations of climcorchemical quantities. Interference of drugs with antigen-antibody reactions might also help to explain some beneficial effects or undesirable side effects of certain drugs.

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common chronic systemic inflammatory diseases, affecting approximately 1 % of the adult population. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been the mainstay of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis when combined with physical therapy and aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Recently, a number of new biological therapies have been introduced for the treatment of this condition and will have a major impact on the future management of this disabling disease. In this review, we summarise data on the efficacy and tolerability of the currently available DMARDs, including gold compounds, antimalarials, penicillamine, cytotoxic drugs (azathioprine and cyclophosphamide), sulfasalazine, methotrexate, leflunomide, cyclosporin, anti-tumour necrosis factor agents, combination therapy and apheresis. A literature review and quality assessment of economic evaluations of DMARDs is presented, illustrating that there has been a paucity of economic evaluations on these agents and showing the variable quality of those studies that are available. The manuscript also addresses the pharmacoeconomic implications of the new agents for rheumatoid arthritis; the need for formal long term economic evaluations in order to determine the cost effectiveness of these costly, but highly effective, new treatments is emphasised.

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} {{is associated}} with substantial costs to both the individual and society; costs increase as disease severity worsens. Current thinking is that disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy should be started {{as soon as possible}} after the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and that patients should be offered the most effective treatment available. Etanercept is a soluble dimeric fusion protein comprising two copies of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the human p 75 receptor for tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) linked to the constant portion of human immunoglobulin G 1. TNFalpha is thought {{to play an important role}} in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis; by binding the cytokine, etanercept blocks its biologic effects. In a 12 -month double-blind, randomized study involving patients with early active rheumatoid arthritis, administration of subcutaneous etanercept 25 mg twice weekly was associated with a more rapid and significantly greater overall response (assessed using American College of Rheumatology criteria) than oral methotrexate. In addition, compared with methotrexate, etanercept was associated with more rapid slowing of radiographic progression and a more rapid improvement in measures of health-related quality of life. The efficacy of etanercept was maintained at 3 years' follow-up. Etanercept, alone or in combination with methotrexate, also showed sustained efficacy in three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies of 3 to 6 months' duration involving patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who had not responded adequately to previous treatment with DMARDs. Etanercept was generally well tolerated in clinical trials (the most commonly occurring adverse events included injection site reactions, infection, headache, nausea, rhinitis, dizziness, pharyngitis and cough). The high cost of etanercept relative to traditional DMARDs may be justified if it can be shown to reduce long-term outcomes associated with rheumatoid arthritis, thereby reducing disease costs. Conclusion: Etanercept is an important new treatment option in rheumatoid arthritis. It provides a rapid and sustained reduction in disease activity and inhibits the progression of structural damage in patients with early active rheumatoid arthritis, with good tolerability. The improvement in disease activity and slowing of joint damage seen with etanercept was more rapid than that seen with methotrexate. In addition, etanercept, alone or in combination with methotrexate, is effective in the treatment of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who have not responded adequately to previous DMARD therapy. It is anticipated that etanercept may also improve the long-term outcome of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and reduce the substantial economic burden imposed by the disease; however, more long-term data are needed to establish this. <b>Antirheumatics,</b> Corticosteroids, Disease modifying <b>antirheumatics,</b> Etanercept, Methotrexate, Rheumatoid arthritis...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Depression {{is one of}} {{the five}} most {{frequent}} disorders in primary care practice and often remains unrecognized. One of the reasons why depression often passes unnoticed is comorbidity – a number of different chronic diseases coexist with depression, especially in elderly patients. Aim: The aim of this research was to assess the difference between depressed and non-depressed patients regarding somatic and mental comorbidity. The differences in drug use were also examined. Subjects and Methods: Five hundred successive adult patients visiting family physicians in Rijeka, Croatia, were polled using the Beck Depression Inventory and a general questionnaire which was created for the purpose of the study. The existing medical records were also used. Results: Elevated depression level was determined in 48. 1 % of the examinees. These patients were suffering from larger number of chronic diseases (X= 1. 23) than non-depressed patients (X= 0. 70; t= 5. 07; p< 0. 001; z= 4. 93; p< 0. 001), especially cardiac, mental, renal and osteomuscular diseases. Depressed persons used significantly more drugs (X= 1. 28) than non-depressed patients (X= 0. 58; t= 6. 10; p< 0. 001; z= 5. 78; p< 0. 001), especially <b>antirheumatics,</b> analgesics, sedatives, antidepressants, antiallergics and diuretics.

40|$|Abstract: Supplementing {{a recent}} review ‘Health effects of high radon environments in Central Europe: another test for the HLNT {{hypothesis}} [1]’, this review of medical radon applications (in particular {{for the treatment of}} painful degenerative joint and spine diseases) covers mainly the first century of large-scale use and scientific studies on this subject since the discovery of radon. Most of the studies and experiences originated in Europe, in particular Germany, Austria, and the former USSR. They have in common that they are not well known in the anglophonic scientific literature, where radon therapy is still frequently considered a placebo-type ‘traditional medicine’, and not be compared with the drugs such as non-steroid <b>antirheumatics.</b> However, based on the substantial experiences as reflected in more than one thousand papers, mostly in peer-reviewed scientific journals, on this subject, radon therapy by inhalation or baths has been established as an evidence-based effective treatment not only by empirical experience in different times and cultures, but also in randomised clinical double-blind studies. It should be further explored as an effective alternative to the use of pharmaca. Unlike radon, drugs cause serious side effects, with more than ten thousand annual casualties. The benefits in the adequate use of low-dose radon exposures far exceed the hypothetical lung cancer risk attributed to the inhalation of low radon concentrations. Further research could provide better understanding of the mechanism of the stimulating radon effects on the body’s defence systems...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of the pharmacotherapeutic circle (PTC), a general practitioner (GP) prescribing-improvement programme to enhance prescribing quality and reduce drug costs. Design: Combined pre- and post-intervention time-series design using an internal comparison of subgroups and an external comparative control. Setting: Small discussion groups meeting 8 times over 18 months. Participants: 79 GPs exceeding the mean drug costs/patient of all Hessian physicians by >= 40 %; 10 moderators. Interventions: Peer-review feedback of prescription patterns based on guidelines targeting 3 suboptimal prescribing areas: drug prescriptions lacking evidence-based efficacy (target A); presumptive prescribing habits (target B); and underprescribing of new, effective therapies (target C). Main outcome measures and results: Significant decreases in prescription rates for target A drugs were recorded for varicose vein medications (p = 0. 006), peripheral vasodilators (p = 0. 0001) and topical <b>antirheumatics</b> (p = 0. 0145), but not for prokinetics/enzymes/digestives. Prescribing of target B drugs such as benzodiazepines and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs declined markedly (p = 0. 0019 and 0. 0014, respectively). Target C drug prescriptions such as for opioids and proton pump inhibitors were not significantly increased. Highly significant reductions in prescription costs were observed for target A and B drugs, irrespective of whether GPs were stratified into high, medium or low prescribers. When mean prescribing costs for PTC participants were compared with those of a control group comprising 8000 GPs over a 21 -month period, PTC GPs decreased their costs by 2 %, whereas drug costs for all Hessian physicians rose by 10 %. Conclusions: PTCs appear to be an effective method to optimise the quality of drug prescribing and reduce drug costs.

40|$|AIM Adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) {{are a major}} burden {{in health}} care, regularly leading to hospital admission, morbidity or death. Women {{tend to have a}} higher risk of adverse drug reactions with a 1. 5 to 1. 7 -fold greater risk than men. Our primary aim was to study differences in ADR-related hospitalizations between the sexes. METHODS We conducted a nationwide study of all ADR-related hospitalizations in the period between 2000 and 2005 in the Netherlands, which were selected from all 9 287 162 hospital admissions in this period. ADR-drug group combinations with at least 50 admissions in one of the sexes were selected. Relative risks and confidence intervals were calculated with respect to total admissions and total prescriptions with men as reference. RESULTS In total, 0. 41 % of the 4 236 368 admissions in men (95 % CI 0. 40, 0. 42 %) and 0. 47 % of the 5 050 794 admissions in women (95 % CI 0. 46, 0. 48 %) were attributed to an ADR by medical specialists (57 % of all ADR-related admissions were in women). Differences between the sexes in risk for ADR-related hospitalization were found for antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs, <b>antirheumatics,</b> anticoagulants and salicylates, cardiovascular and neurological drugs, steroids and antibiotics. In certain drug categories, risks for hospitalization changed after taking into account total drug prescriptions. CONCLUSION In all different drug classes, significant differences exist between the sexes in ADR-related hospital admissions. Cardiovascular drugs account for the most pronounced differences between men and women. More research is needed to explain the clear sex differences in ADR-related hospital admissions. © 2010 The Authors. British Journal of Clinical Pharmacolog...|$|E
40|$|This 9 -month {{pragmatic study}} {{compared}} 2 therapeutic regimens {{in the management}} of osteoarthritis of the hip and knee. Patients received either diacerein 100 mg/day plus standard osteoarthritic therapy for 6 months, followed by a 3 -month monitoring period without diacerein, or standard therapy alone for the entire 9 -month period. A total of 207 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip were enrolled. Improvements in Lequesne's functional index and quality-of-life scores (revised Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales Health Status Questionnaire and Nottingham Health Profile), and decreases in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and analgesic consumption were significantly greater with diacerein plus standard therapy than with standard therapy alone. The overall assessment of therapy by patients was good or excellent for 60 % of those who received diacerein plus standard therapy, compared with 26 % who received standard therapy alone. Medical and paramedical procedures carried out in addition to those stipulated in the protocol (medical consultations, physiotherapy, nursing, etc.), osteoarthritisrelated, were fewer and less costly in the diacerein plus standard therapy group than in the standard therapy group. The average outpatient cost (in 1995 French francs) of osteoarthritis treatment in the standard therapy group was FF 2272 compared with FF 2360 in the diacerein plus standard therapy group. The cost-effectiveness ratios per point scored on Lequesne's index were FF 1893 for the standard therapy group and FF 1072 for the diacerein plus standard therapy group, leading to a saving of 43 % with diacerein plus standard therapy.

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is a prevalent condition {{associated with}} pain, joint destruction and morbidity. Direct healthcare costs are 2 to 3 {{times higher than}} average costs for individuals of similar age and gender. Furthermore, utilisation and costs rise with age and disease duration. Managed care has become an increasingly popular way to organise and finance the delivery of healthcare. Studies comparing {{the quality of care}} in health maintenance organisations and fee-for-service settings have found few differences in outcomes, although reduced costs have been attributed to lower hospitalisation rates in patients with RA. We reviewed 10 studies of the direct costs of RA. In 1996 dollars, direct costs ranged from $US 2299 per person per year in Canada to $US 13 549 in a US study focusing on patients who have been hospitalised only. Surprisingly, the contributions to direct costs - hospital care, medications and physician visits - remained relatively stable over time and the setting of care. Hospitalisation costs were the highest component of direct costs accounting, generally, for 60 % or more of costs while only approximately 10 % of patients with RA were hospitalised. The only exception was a managed care setting where hospitalisation costs were 16 % of total direct costs. In managed care settings, costs of medications were proportionately higher than in fee-for-service settings. We conclude that in studies of the direct costs of RA the components of costs have remained relatively stable over time. This may change with the development and growing use of new RA medications including cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitors, interleukins, cytokines, treatments that inhibit tumour necrosis factor, and combination therapies. The effectiveness of managed care in controlling direct costs needs to be evaluated in more targeted studies. <b>Antirheumatics,</b> Cost analysis, Managed care, Pharmacoeconomics, Resource use, Rheumatoid arthritis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Acetaminophen {{overdose}} is a {{major concern}} among the pediatric population. Our objective was to assess the validity of International Classification of Disease (ICD- 9 -CM) codes for identification of pediatric emergency department (ED) visits resulting from acetaminophen exposure or overdose. Methods We conducted a retrospective medical record review of ED visits at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, Texas, between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2010. Visits coded with 1 or more ICD- 9 codes for poisoning (965, 977, and their subcodes and supplemental E-codes E 850, E 858, E 935, E 947, and E 950 and their subcodes) were identified from an administrative database, and further review of the medical records was conducted to identify true cases of acetaminophen exposure or overdose. We then examined the sensitivity, positive predictive value, and percentage of false positives identified by various codes and code combinations to establish which codes most accurately identified acetaminophen exposure or overdose. Results Of 1, 215 ED visits documented with 1 or more of the selected codes, 316 (26. 0 %) were a result of acetaminophen exposure or overdose. Sensitivity was highest (87. 0 %) for the combination of codes 965. 4 (poisoning by aromatic analgesics, not elsewhere classified) and E 950. 0 (suicide and self-inflicted poisoning by analgesics, antipyretics, and <b>antirheumatics),</b> with a positive predictive value of 86. 2 %. Code 965. 4 alone yielded a sensitivity of 85. 1 %, with a positive predictive value of 92. 8 %. Code performance varied among age groups and {{depending on the type of}} exposure (intentional or unintentional). Conclusion ICD- 9 codes are useful for ascertaining which ED visits are a result of acetaminophen exposure or overdose within the pediatric population. However, because ICD- 9 coding differs by age group and depending on the type of exposure, hypothesis-driven strategies must be utilized for each pediatric age group to avoid misclassification. </p...|$|E

This study aims to explore the role of hospitalization on medication changes as patients are transferred from and back to ambulatory care. Methods: Secondary analysis of claims data from Swiss residents with basic health insurance at the Helsana Group was performed. We evaluated medication invoices of patients who were hospitalized in a Swiss private hospital group in the year 2013. Medication changes were defined as discontinuation, new prescription, or change in the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System level 4, which is equivalent {{to a change in}} the chemical/therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup. Multiple Poisson regression analysis was applied to evaluate whether medication change was predicted by socioeconomic or clinical patient characteristics or by a system factor (physician dispensing of medication allowed in canton of residence). Results: We investigated a total of 10, 123 hospitalized patients, among whom a mean number of 3. 85 (median 3. 00) changes were identified. Change most frequently affected antihypertensives, analgesics, and <b>antirheumatics.</b> If patients were enrolled in a managed care plan, they were less likely to undergo changes. If a patient resided in a canton, in which physicians were allowed to dispense medication directly, the patient was more likely to experience change. Conclusion: There is considerable change in medication when patients shift between ambulatory and inpatient health care levels. This interruption of medication continuity is in part desirable as it responds to clinical needs. However, we hypothesize that there is also a significant proportion of change due to unwarranted factors such as financial incentives for change of products.
