This work won the Suntory Literary Prize in 2000 and made Azuma the youngest writer to ever win that prize. Akira Asada stated that {{it is one of}} the best books written in the 90s; however, Hiroo Yamagata pointed out that the book is based on the misunderstanding of Godel's incompleteness theorem. He also wrote Dobutsuka-suru Postmodern (<b>Animalizing</b> Postmodernity) (translated as Otaku: Japan's Database Animals in 2001), which analyzes Japanese pop culture through a postmodern lens. He has also set up a non-profit organization to encourage cutting-edge critics who might be shut out of the existing publishing world.|$|E
5000|$|The {{hyaline layer}} is {{responsible}} for the adhesion and proper orientation if the cells of an embryo. Throughout development, certain cells change their binding affinity towards hyalin. Hyalin helps cells differentiate into the animal and the vegetal halves during oogenesis by utilizing zinc and lithium ions. Zinc enhances the amount of hyalin precipitated, while lithium keeps the hyalin solubilized when around calcium. Zinc, then, causes an <b>animalizing</b> effect since the binding of the blastula cells would be stronger, while the weaker attachment of the cells would form the vegetal half. Cells can further differentiate if they gain an affinity towards other membranes. Invagination of the blastula occurs when the endoderm loses its affinity towards hyalin, while the ectoderm retains it. [...] This leads to the keystone shape of the gastrula, with the different layers forming into separate biological systems.|$|E
40|$|Situated in neo-democratic globalizing Northeast Brazil, this anthropological study probes {{the role}} of {{ecological}} context in framing, experiencing, and expressing human distress. Ethnographic interviews, narratives, and "contextualized semantic analysis" reveal the lived experience of childhood respiratory diseases among 22 urban mangrove dwellers. Informants speak an "eco-idiom of respiratory distress" based on a popular "eco-logic", reflecting the harsh reality of "living in dampness". "Higher-up" residents legitimize their feelings of superiority by stigmatizing "lowlanders" as taboo, diseased (with porcine cysticercosis, swine flu) "filthy pigs, stuck in the muck" (atolados na lama). <b>Animalizing</b> inhabitants' identities demotes them to nonpersons. Besides infections, children suffer social stigma, ostracism, and barriers for accessing care. Promoting a "favorable environment" requires reducing ecological risk, challenging class-based prejudice, and restoring human dignity...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe discuss recent {{progress}} in understanding how cell fates are specified along the animal–vegetal {{axis of the}} sea urchin embryo. This process is initiated by cell-autonomous, maternally directed, mechanisms that establish three unique gene-regulatory domains. These domains are defined by distinct sets of vegetalizing (β-catenin) and <b>animalizing</b> transcription factor (ATF) activities and their region of overlap in the macromeres, which specifies these cells as early mesendoderm. Subsequent signaling among cleavage-stage blastomeres further subdivides fates of macromere progeny to yield major embryonic tissues. Zygotically produced Wnt 8 reinforces maternally regulated levels of nuclear β-catenin in vegetal derivatives to down regulate ATF activity and further promote mesendoderm fates. Signaling through the Notch receptor from the vegetal micromere lineages diverts adjacent mesendoderm to secondary mesenchyme fates. Continued Wnt signaling expands the vegetal domain of β-catenin's transcriptional regulatory activity and competes with animal signaling factors, including BMP 2 / 4, to specify the endoderm–ectoderm border within veg 1 progeny. This model places new emphasis {{on the importance of}} the ratio of maternally regulated vegetal and animal transcription factor activities in initial specification events along the animal–vegetal axis...|$|E
40|$|The animal pole {{region of}} the sea urchin larva is {{composed}} of the thickened animal plate, and the apical ganglion formed by several serotonergic cells. Recent studies have revealed many genes involved in the differentiation and construction of these structures. However, the cellular basis of specification process is largely unknown. To understand how these structures are specified, we tried to clarify the properties of animal hemisphere by manipulative methods. The isolation experiments revealed that some cytoplasmic factors responsible for the thickening of the ectodermal epithelium form a gradient from the animal pole toward the equator. The deletion experiments showed that an 1 blastomeres are required {{for the formation of}} animal plate and apical ganglion. Recombination and transplantation experiments suggested that the presumed thickening factors are easily inactivated by the vegetal signal, and that a low concentration of thickening factors promotes the differentiation of serotonergic cells, while the factors inhibit serotonergic cell differentiation at higher concentrations. Further, pulse treatment with <b>animalizing</b> or vegetalizing reagent showed that the specification process terminates during the mesenchyme blastula stage. Based on these results, we propose a model that explains the experimentally caused changes in the size of animal plate and in the width of apical ganglion...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn Brave New World (1932), {{children}} are created in test tubes and maternity is {{held to be}} a disgraceful remnant {{of the past that}} only subsists in reservations for "savages". Eroticism, the privilege of civilized humanity, is part of culture, whereas natural procreation reduces one to sheer animal state. In works of contemporary science fiction, viviparity is depicted as a form of <b>animalizing</b> parasitism. Underlying these representations is the idea that the more "evolved" a species is held to be, that is, the less it procreates and the more it is dependent upon less evolved species in order to reproduce. The demography of modern Western societies, which conceive of themselves as the height of evolution and civilization, owe in this regard to other, supposedly less-evolved cultural groups, through migration and through the adoption of foreign children. These same, "more evolved" societies are also those that are most preoccupied with the fear of over-population which they portray as a major threat for humanity as a whole. The parasitical and swarming aspects of insect reproduction make these animals favored bad-guy characters in Hollywood science fiction. The battle of culture against nature is depicted as an unending combat between humanity and insect-like extraterrestrial species that tend to parasitize human beings in order to reproduce...|$|E

40|$|There are {{prominent}} animal figures and graphic moments of animal imagery {{in several of}} Edgar Allan Poe’s short stories. These animals {{are at the heart}} of the action; they are often main characters. Poe’s animals have voices and these voices challenge the dominant monologue of the narrators and undermine the prevalent ideologies that the stories enact. Poe’s animals shriek, wail, and scream and their voices enable political critiques of some of the central issues at the heart of antebellum America. Without these animals, the marginalized voices could not be heard. The animal denizens in Poe’s stories speak: the cat of “The Black Cat” screams, interrupting and condemning a patriarchal narrator and the orangutan of “The Murders in the Rue Morgue” shrieks, shaves, and murders like a human, challenging the dehumanization of slaves in America. Animal imagery also speaks in the final two stories, but not in the same way; <b>animalizing</b> another being capitalizes on a hierarchy of classifications. By categorizing their oppressors as animals, the patients of “The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether” open up a discourse with the narrator in a place where the psychology of madness would silence the voices of the insane and the jester of “Hop-Frog” subverts the monarchical dominance that would oppress the court fool. Poe’s fictional animals reveal how the categories used to construct American ideologies could marginalize, abuse, and exploit different beings. These animal voices force these categories into crisis, destabilizing the definition of the human and problematizing the treatment of a variety of subhuman beings. Poe is not an animal rights advocate, but his animal figures are able to show us the problems and power of the categorical systems we use to structure our lives...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{will examine}} {{the ways in which}} anti-Semitic and more {{generalized}} racial theories were powerfully and effectively mobilized under Hitler and his Nazi regime. In the establishment of Nazi ideology and the practice of its principles, Hitler drew upon an old, extensive and specific genre of <b>animalizing</b> language. Hitler's regime skillfully employed contemporary and diverse modes of discourse to dehumanize and devastate the Jewish people. By juxtaposing traditional anti-Semitic beliefs with ideals of Aryan superiority, the Nazis were able to expand and strengthen pre-existing anti-Semitism whilst reaffirming Germany as the ultimate example of evolutionary progression. Integral to Hitler's success was the use of animal imagery and its respective connotations, associations and evocations. Throughout Hitler's regime, the term "animal" remained without an exact or precise definition; the ambiguous definition of "animal" allowed for multiple applications – both destructive and constructive. When used in reference to the Jews, the term "animal" was loaded with a barrage of degrading references, images and emotions. The Jews were described as dirty, disease-ridden rats: weak, despoiling animals that needed to be exterminated and bloodsucking parasites that presented an imminent threat to German bloodlines, culture, morality and economy. These images all stirred feelings of disgust, abhorrence and fear especially when linked to ideas of unpredictable and overwhelming plagues and swarms. The concept of human "animals" was also applied to the Germans but with completely different consequences. The German "animal" was a natural predator, a super wolf, a noble and loyal dog. This wolf/dog was upheld for its prowess, its commitment to the pack and its virile bloodline. This image of animalism was not a degradation or an admission of German inferiority; rather, it was a declaration of evolutionary achievement and innate superiority. The flexibility of the term "animal" was always loaded with emotive connotations and representations whilst remaining fluid in its applicability – only to be temporarily fixed as and when it suited Nazi ends. Hitler utilized the ascribed authority of scientific and pseudo-scientific theories to reinforce a sense of legitimacy and add a compelling rationality to Nazi ideology. Modern media were efficiently employed to spread Nazi beliefs: emotive speeches and new legislative measures were broadcast on the radio; propaganda was printed and circulated whilst cinematography captured the imaginations of many Germans and represented the Jews' "animal" nature. With a wealth of resources available to his purposes, Hitler was able to form and strengthen an ideology that had every appearance of being credible, necessary, righteous and legitimate. Innovative concepts and practices of industrialism were important in the mobilization of Hitler's racial campaign; the employment of new technologies appealed to a sense of progress and national self-improvement as well as providing effective and detached methods of removing the Jewish presence from Germany. When placed within multiple modes of discourse, images of animalism became increasingly pervasive and the dehumanization of the Jews was well underway...|$|E

2500|$|With St. John, Kiss {{released}} the album <b>Animalize</b> on September 13, 1984. <b>Animalize</b> followed {{the success of}} Lick It Up, and {{due in part to}} consistent MTV play for the [...] "Heaven's on Fire" [...] video, <b>Animalize</b> was the band's best-selling record in America during the decade, with over two million albums sold. With the success of the album and subsequent tour, Kiss had recaptured some of their earlier glory (though not to the level of their 1970s heyday). St. John, however, came down with reactive arthritis during tour rehearsals, and only performed at a handful of shows. St. John was relieved of his duties from Kiss in December 1984 and was replaced by Kulick (born December 12, 1953, in Brooklyn). Kulick was Kiss' fourth lead guitarist in less than three years, but he stayed with the band for 12 years. Kulick was one of the band's longest-serving members, with the longest continuous tenure of anyone other than Simmons and Stanley, but he never wore the band's iconic makeup.|$|R
