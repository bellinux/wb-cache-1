25|$|The large {{geometry}} change {{associated with}} <b>azobenzene</b> photoisomerization {{has also been}} used to control protein activity with light. <b>Azobenzene</b> has been attached to ligands (drug) to photo-modulate their affinity for proteins. <b>Azobenzene</b> has been employed as a photoswitchable tether between a ligand and the protein: {{one end of the}} <b>azobenzene</b> is substituted with a reactive group that attaches to the target protein. The other end displays a ligand for the protein. Depending on where the <b>azobenzene</b> is attached, either the cis or trans isomer will present the ligand to the ligand-binding site, while the other isomer prevents the drug from reaching the site. Again, photoswitching between isomers turns the protein on and off. When applied to ion channels in the nervous system, this approach affords optical control of electrical activity in neurons.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azobenzene</b> is a {{chemical}} compound {{composed of two}} phenyl rings linked by a N=N double bond. It is the simplest example of an aryl azo compound. The term 'azobenzene' or simply 'azo' {{is often used to}} refer to a wide class of molecules that share the core <b>azobenzene</b> structure, with different chemical functional groups extending from the phenyl rings. These azo compounds are considered as derivatives of diazene (diimide), and are sometimes referred to as 'diazenes'. The diazenes absorb light strongly and are used as dyes in a variety of industries.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azobenzene</b> {{molecules}} can {{be incorporated}} into polymer matrices as stabilizers. It is also {{interesting to note that the}} rigid rod-like structure of azo molecules allows them to behave as liquid-crystal mesogens in many materials.|$|E
50|$|The {{photochromic}} trans-cis isomerization of <b>azobenzenes</b> {{has been}} used extensively in molecular switches, often taking advantage of its shape change upon isomerization to produce a supramolecular result. In particular, <b>azobenzenes</b> incorporated into crown ethers give switchable receptors and <b>azobenzenes</b> in monolayers can provide light-controlled changes in surface properties.|$|R
40|$|<b>Azobenzenes</b> can undergo photoisomerization, {{therefore}} systems incorporating these chromophores present light-switchable properties. The reversible photoisomerization {{from the}} trans to the cis form {{is accompanied by}} several changes at the molecular level. Differences in the absorption spectrum, polarity and structure between the two isomers {{have been used in}} various systems to fine-tune other properties of these systems with light. The present work reviews physical properties that can be photomodulated in polymers functionalised with <b>azobenzenes.</b> Emphasis is put on electric and magnetic properties, structural changes, surface properties, binding activity, complexation, stereochemistry, ion permeability and enzyme activity.

40|$|In {{association}} with increasing diabetes prevalence, {{it is desirable}} to develop new glucose sensing systems with low cost, ease of use, high stability and good portability. Boronic acid {{is one of the}} potential candidates for a future alternative to enzyme-based glucose sensors. Boronic acid derivatives have been widely used for the sugar recognition motif, because boronic acids bind adjacent diols to form cyclic boronate esters. In order to develop colorimetric sugar sensors, boronic acid-conjugated <b>azobenzenes</b> have been synthesized. There are several types of boronic acid <b>azobenzenes,</b> and their characteristics tend to rely on the substitute position of the boronic acid moiety. For example, o-substitution of boronic acid to the azo group gives the advantage of a significant color change upon sugar addition. Nitrogen- 15 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) studies clearly show a signaling mechanism based on the formation and cleavage of the B–N dative bond between boronic acid and azo moieties in the dye. Some boronic acid-substituted <b>azobenzenes</b> were attached to a polymer or utilized for supramolecular chemistry to produce glucose-selective binding, in which two boronic acid moieties cooperatively bind one glucose molecule. In addition, boronic acid-substituted <b>azobenzenes</b> have been applied not only for glucose monitoring, but also for the sensing of glycated hemoglobin and dopamine...|$|R
25|$|The photo-isomerization of <b>azobenzene</b> is {{extremely}} rapid, occurring on picosecond timescales. The {{rate of the}} thermal back-relaxation varies greatly depending on the compound: usually hours for azobenzene-type molecules, minutes for aminoazobenzenes, and seconds for the pseudo-stilbenes.|$|E
25|$|Bulk {{expansion}} and contraction of <b>azobenzene</b> materials {{have also been}} observed. In one report, a thin film was made to bend and unbend by exposing it to polarized light. The direction of the macroscopic motion could be controlled by the polarization direction. The bending occurred because the free surface of the material contracted more than {{the inside of the}} thin film (due to absorption of laser light as it passes through the film).|$|E
25|$|In 1995, it was {{reported}} that exposing a thin film of azo-polymer to a light intensity (or polarization) gradient leads to spontaneous surface patterns. In essence, the polymer material will reversibly deform so as to minimize the amount of material exposed to the light. This phenomenon is not laser ablation, since it readily occurs at low power and the transformation is reversible. The mechanism of this surface holography seems related to a new photomechanical effect, involving <b>azobenzene</b> isomerization.|$|E
40|$|Surface relief {{gratings}} (SRGs) on organic {{thin films}} are studied extensively for both scientific interest and in {{relevance to the}} applications. Among the chromophores being used the <b>azobenzenes</b> showed the best performance, {{but the use of}} alternative photo-sensitive groups provides better general understanding of the phenomena. A thermodynamic theory and molecular dynamics simulations of photoinduced effects are discussed. In this study we use indandione derivatives, known as promising materials for photonics applications, {{as an alternative to the}} <b>azobenzenes.</b> We consider their photoreactions when incorporated into a polymer film.

25|$|The {{wavelengths}} {{at which}} <b>azobenzene</b> isomerization occurs {{depends on the}} particular structure of each azo molecule, but they are typically grouped into three classes: the azobenzene-type molecules, the aminoazobenzenes, and the pseudo-stilbenes. These azos are yellow, orange, and red, respectively, owing to the subtle differences in their electronic absorption spectra. The compounds similar to the unsubstituted <b>azobenzene</b> exhibit a low-intensity n-π* absorption in the visible region, and a much higher intensity π-π* absorption in the ultraviolet. Azos that are ortho- or para-substituted with electron-donating groups (such as aminos), are classified as aminoazobenzenes, and tend to closely spaced n-π* and π-π* bands in the visible. The pseudo-stilbene class is characterized by substituting the 4 and 4' positions of the two azo rings with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups (that is, the two {{opposite ends of the}} aromatic system are functionalized). The addition of this push-pull configuration results in a strongly asymmetric electron distribution, which modifies a host of optical properties. In particular, it shifts the absorption spectra of the trans and the cis isomers, so that they effectively overlap. Thus, for these compounds a single wavelength of light in the visible region will induce both the forward and reverse isomerization. Under illumination, these molecules cycle between the two isomeric states.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{intriguing}} properties of <b>azobenzene</b> (and derivatives) is the photoisomerization of trans and cis isomers. The two isomers can be switched with particular wavelengths of light: ultraviolet light, which corresponds to the energy gap of the π-π* (S2 state) transition, for trans-to-cis conversion, and blue light, which is equivalent to that of the n-π* (S1 state) transition, for cis-to-trans isomerization. For a variety of reasons, the cis isomer is less stable than the trans (for instance, it has a distorted configuration and is less delocalized than the trans configuration). The trans isomer is more stable by approximately 50 kJ/mol, and the barrier to isomerization in the ground state is approximately 100 kJ/mol.|$|E
25|$|The photo-isomerization of <b>azobenzene</b> {{is a form}} of light-induced {{molecular}} motion. This isomerization {{can also}} lead to motion on larger length scales. For instance, polarized light will cause the molecules to isomerize and relax in random positions. However, those relaxed (trans) molecules that fall perpendicular to the incoming light polarization will {{no longer be able to}} absorb, and will remain fixed. Thus, there is a statistical enrichment of chromophores perpendicular to polarized light (orientational hole burning). Polarized irradiation will make an azo-material anisotropic and therefore optically birefringent and dichroic. This photo-orientation can also be used to orient other materials (especially in liquid crystal systems). For instance, it has been used to orient liquid crystal domains selectively, and to create nonlinear optical (NLO) materials.-sonogel glasses|journal=Journal of Sol-Gel Science and Technology|year=2010|volume=56|issue=1|pages=7–18|doi=10.1007/s10971-010-2265-y|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/f06488h188176783/}} Azo isomerization can also be used to photo-switch the liquid crystal phase of a material from cholesteric to nematic or to change the pitch of a cholesteric phase.|$|E
