40|$|The cell-surface <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> cell-surface {{hydrophobicity}} of 10 {{strains of}} Azospirillum spp. {{were evaluated by}} the aqueous, two-polymer phase partitioning assay. Azospirillum spp. had moderate cell-surface hydrophobicity <b>and</b> <b>charge,</b> lower than known values for human pathogens. The hydrophobicity <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> values were higher in solid than in liquid media. A general pattern of modifying hydrophobicity <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> by external treatments of the cells of all strains was not found, but various chemicals, temperatures, and enzymatic treatments changed the cell-surface hydrophobicity <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> in different strains. A similar hydrophobic protein was isolated, and partially characterized, from two strains of A. brasilense and one strain of A. lipoferum. This study proposes: (i) cell-surface hydrophobicity <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> of Azospirillum spp. can be affected by external treatments of the bacterium cell, and (ii) hydrophobicity <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> may play a role, perhaps small, in the primary adsorption of Azospirillum spp. to surfaces...|$|R

50|$|For example, {{a theory}} of the {{electron}} may begin by postulating a mass <b>and</b> <b>charge.</b> However, in quantum field theory this electron {{is surrounded by a}} cloud of possibilities of other virtual particles such as photons, which interact with the original electron. Taking these interactions into account shows that the electron-system in fact behaves as if it had a different mass <b>and</b> <b>charge.</b> Renormalization replaces the originally postulated mass <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> with new numbers such that the observed mass <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> matches those originally postulated.|$|R

40|$|Today, {{telematics}} services are o Aen compositions of different chargeable service components offered by different service providers. To enhance component-based accounting <b>and</b> <b>charging,</b> the service composition information {{is used to}} match with the corresponding charging structure of a service session. This enables the sharing of revenues among the service providers, and calculation of the total cost for the end-user. When multiple independent service providers are involved, {{it is a great}} challenge to apply interim accounting <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> during a service session in order to minimize financial risks between business partners. Another interesting development is the trend towards outsourcing accounting <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> processes to specialized business partners. This requires a decoupling between provisioning <b>and</b> accounting <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> processes. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive component-based accounting <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> architecture to support service session provisioning across multiple domains. The architecture, modeled in UML, incorporates an interim accounting <b>and</b> <b>charging</b> mechanism to enable the processing and exchange of accounting information needed to update intermediate charges for separate service components and the user’s credit, even during the service provisioning phase...|$|R

5|$|Swedish {{heraldry}} encompasses heraldic {{achievements in}} modern and historic Sweden. Swedish heraldic style {{is consistent with}} the German-Nordic heraldic tradition, noted for its multiple helmets and crests which are treated as inseparable from the shield, its repetition of colours <b>and</b> <b>charges</b> between the shield and the crest, and its scant use of heraldic furs. Because the medieval history of the Nordic countries was so closely related, their heraldic individuality developed rather late. Swedish and Finnish heraldry have a shared history prior to the Diet of Porvoo in 1809; these, together with Danish heraldry, were heavily influenced by German heraldry. Unlike the highly stylized and macaronic language of English blazon, Swedish heraldry is described in plain language, using (in most cases) only Swedish terminology.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, Sayers and Bears {{teammate}} Brian Piccolo {{became the}} first interracial roommates in the NFL. Sayers' ensuing friendship with Piccolo and Piccolo's struggle with cancer (embryonal cell carcinoma, which was diagnosed after it metastasized to a large tumor in his chest cavity), {{became the subject of}} the made-for-TV movie Brian's Song. The movie, in which Sayers was portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in the 1971 original and by Mekhi Phifer in the 2001 remake, was adapted from Sayers' account of this story in his 1970 autobiography, I Am Third. A notable aspect of Sayers' friendship with Piccolo, a white man, and the first film's depiction of their friendship, was its effect on race relations. The first film was made in the wake of racial riots, escalating racial tensions fueled by Martin Luther King's assassination, <b>and</b> <b>charges</b> of discrimination across the nation. Sayers and Piccolo were devoted friends and deeply respectful of and affectionate with each other. Piccolo helped Sayers through rehabilitation after injury, and Sayers was by Piccolo's side throughout his illness until his death in June 1970.|$|E
