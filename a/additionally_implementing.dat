The building’s architectural, historic and technological value is significant and its preservation, by minimization of interventions, posed several problems to the retrofit design.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} proliferation of small civilian Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), {{the threat to}} critical infrastructure (CI) security and privacy is now widely recognised and must be addressed. These devices are easily available at a low cost, with their usage largely unrestricted allowing users to have no accountability. Further, current implementations of UAVs have little to no security measures applied to their control interfaces. To combat the threat raised by small UAVs, being aware of their presence is required, a task that can be challenging and often requires customised hardware. This thesis aimed to address the threats posed by the Parrot AR Drone v 2, by presenting a data link signature detection method which provides the characteristics needed to implement a mitigation method, capable of stopping a UAVs movement and video stream. These methods were developed using an experimental procedure and are packaged {{as a group of}} Python scripts.

40|$|Hamstring muscle {{injuries}} {{constitute a}} major concern in football and a major challenge for physiotherapists working in this sport, being an injury with long absence from playing and training. Although clinical strategies to rehabilitate these injuries and clinical injury risk assessments have been explored over the years, a broader comprehension of how variables regarding running performance may in some form relate to hamstring injury risk has been missing for clinical professionals. Together with this, its incidence has been increasing despite many preventive efforts, which reveals a necessity for developing risk assessment methods to better inform preventive strategies. The key involvement of hamstring muscles during accelerations and decelerations during football running actions justifies research into acceleration related observations. Therefore, {{the aims of the}} current programme of research were to develop new laboratorial and load monitoring strategies related to acceleration actions, by exploring biomechanical factors from a physiotherapist perspective. <b>Additionally,</b> <b>implementing</b> assessments and exposing some key limitations of these assessments in professional clubs is also described throughout the experimental studies of this thesis (chapters 3 and 5). For the purposes of this thesis, force development variables were analysed in chapter 3, during maximal accelerations on a non-motorised treadmill, and comparisons between professional players with and without previous injuries were performed. Results from this study revealed no differences between groups during both maximal acceleration and steady state of a maximal sprint effort. A second approach regarding risk analysis and acceleration variables considered the mechanical load based on trunk-mounted accelerometry used in outfield training, as detailed in chapter 5 of the present thesis. In this study mechanical load expressed by PlayerLoadTM, an accelerometer-derived variable aimed to express the rate of change in acceleration, was collected for the training sessions during three weeks previous to a hamstring injury event, in English Premier League clubs, using matched healthy controls. Although the results did not show significant differences between experimental and control group, this exploratory method may constitute a promising method to assess hamstring injury risk. Reliability and validity of the acceleration related variables were addressed first for each of the two experimental studies detailed in chapter 3 and 5. For this purpose, a pilot study on reliability of force collection using a non-motorised treadmill was performed to test the experimental protocol with results showing good overall reliability. For the PlayerLoadTM, a laboratorial study detailed in chapter 4 using a laboratorial overground soccer simulation protocol was adopted and convergent validity with subjects´ anthropometrics together with reliability analysis of four isolated football actions (jogging, side cut, stride and sprint) was performed. Results of this study revealed no association between PlayerLoadTM and the subjects height or body mass and also an overall good reliability for the four actions analysed. In summary, the research presented in this thesis helped better understand the current value and limitations of screening and monitoring acceleration related variables in the context of hamstring (re-) injury prevention in professional football, introducing to the clinical field a different perspective of addressing hamstring behaviour during acceleration actions, and its hypothetical relation with hamstring injury...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Ever {{depleting}} fossil resources, growing fossil feedstock {{prices and}} global environmental impact associated with continuously rising {{greenhouse gas emissions}} have led to increased attention for biobased products as alternatives for the present fossil-based ones. It is therefore important for scientists and academics to provide knowledge and explore practical routes for the sustainable transition towards biobased alternatives. This research focuses on the replacement of fossil-based polyethylene (fossil-PE) by biobased PE (bio-PE) from Brazilian sugarcane and polylactic acid (PLA) from US corn. The report gives an outlook on such a shift towards a sustainable biobased economy. The aim {{of this research is}} to assess the characteristics of the biobased product supply chains which could provide in the demand for biobased polyethylene and polylactic acid for the Netherlands on environmental, social and economic aspects in order to contribute to the existing fundamental research on biobased products. This led to the main research question: How sustainable are the supply chains for biobased polyethylene and polylactic acid, which could meet the current demand for fossil-based polyethylene in the Netherlands, and how does this compare to the supply chain of fossil-based polyethylene? An analytical framework is developed along which the three dimensions of sustainability can be evaluated; environmental (greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity and the local environment), social (competition for food, welfare and wellbeing) and economic sustainability (market price). The report focuses on the demand for bio-PE and PLA which could replace the current Dutch demand for PE of approximately 500 kiloton per year. The report shows that on environmental sustainability, bio-PE outperforms fossil-PE and PLA. Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions are particularly low for bio-PE due to the extensive use of bagasse as energy supply. PLA associated greenhouse gas emissions are slightly less than the greenhouse gas emissions for fossil-PE. Depending on the type of land that is converted to biomass feedstock, greenhouse gas emissions can increase due to the release of carbon from decaying biomass and the loss of soil organic carbon. This effect can be significant if rainforest is converted either by direct or indirect land use change. Even so, considering the relatively small demand, enough land is available in Brazil for the production of the biobased products without endangering bio-diverse regions. The main impact of biobased products on the local environment is the imbalance of NPK nutrients and for fossil-based products on- and offshore oil spills. The main concern with regard to the social sustainability was found in the exploitation of sugarcane and corn field workers. Case reports were found on slavery and exploitation, although no structural proof was found. For fossil-PE, decrease of the local welfare and wellbeing was found for several countries producing naphtha. Competition for food was considered as one of the main indicators. It is found that there is no competition for food if only the Dutch demand is considered, but a worldwide demand for multiple biobased products would inevitably lead to competition for food. This stresses the importance of alternative biomass sources that do not impact food supply, such as lignocelluloses. Even though bio-PE shows more favourable results than fossil-PE, biobased products are still unsustainable due to the high market price with respect to the biobased product. With current feedstock prices, market prices for bio-PE and PLA are respectively 40 % to 60 % more expensive than fossil-PE. The price imbalance can be partially {{explained by the fact that}} the costs of environmental degradation are externalized for fossil-based products. Internalizing these externalities by for instance green VAT or carbon tax would level the playing field for biobased products. A reduced green vat of 6 % for “green” products (19 % for normal products) would reduce the difference to 25 % and 40 % for bio-PE and PLA respectively. <b>Additionally</b> <b>implementing</b> a carbon tax of 50 USD/t CO 2 would reduce the difference even further to 15 % and 35 % for bio-PE and PLA respectively. ...|$|E
