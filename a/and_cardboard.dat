5|$|In 1926, Parker Brothers Inc. republished The Mansion of Happiness in its {{original}} form, with minor modification to game spaces. The game included the circular end space introduced by J. Bufford in the third edition. This sixth edition used a folding game board with a fabric <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> pocket on the back edge of the game board. The teetotum was made using a wood dowel <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> hexagon.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland {{developed}} an efficient system to recycle old newspapers <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> materials. Publicly organised collection by volunteers and economical railway transport logistics started {{as early as}} 1865 {{under the leadership of}} the notable industrialist Hans Caspar Escher (Escher Wyss AG) when the first modern Swiss paper manufacturing plant was built in Biberist.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{published}} in the United States by W. & S.B. Ives in Salem, Massachusetts on November 25, 1843. Their game was a folding game board with a cloth <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> pocket attached {{to the bottom of the}} game board along its edge. In the pocket were the rules, implements, and teetotum. Its teetotum was an ivory dowel sharpened to a point at the bottom end inserted in an octagonal ivory plate. This type of teetotum was referred to as a pin and plate teetotum.|$|E

5|$|Structural {{resources}} and fibres from plants {{are used to}} construct dwellings and to manufacture clothing. Wood is used not only for buildings, boats, and furniture, but also for smaller items such as musical instruments and sports equipment. Wood is pulped to make paper <b>and</b> <b>cardboard.</b> Cloth is often made from cotton, flax, ramie or synthetic fibres such as rayon and acetate derived from plant cellulose. Thread used to sew cloth likewise comes in large part from cotton.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{electrical}} {{lines and}} drinking water supplies were cut in La Paz. Also, communication lines were extensively damaged. The La Paz airport received damage during the hurricane; however, by {{the afternoon of}} October1, the airport re-opened, thus allowing the military to provide much-needed aid to victims. Wood, tarpaper, <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> were all scattered throughout La Paz. By October 2, rescue teams had covered 38sqmi (100sqkm) to configure the damage. Throughout the city, a total of 412 people had been killed, 150 were missing people within the resort city, five of which were later presumed dead. Overall, {{nearly a third of}} the houses in La Paz were leveled.|$|E
5|$|Due to flooding, troops {{evacuated}} {{dozens of}} communities along the Gulf coast. Many desert communities {{throughout the state}} were left without any telephone or electrical service; wood, tarpaper, <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> were all scattered. Dozens of scores of huts were destroyed. Many humans were swept into the gulf. Sixteen people died inside {{the remains of a}} building. Moreover, the Piojillo river overflowed its banks, killing many people and resulting in considerable damage. Elsewhere, destruction was reported in San Jose del Cabo, Cabo San Lucas, San Lucas, and Puntas Arena; Pichilinague also received moderate damage. However, there are no known reports of any casualties in all four of those places. Hurricane Liza was also one of six hurricane to directly impact Los Cabos.|$|E
30|$|Several studies {{point out}} the {{possibility}} of underestimation of PFC exposure through food contact materials. Mixtures of perfluorooctanesulfonamide esters are often used in the manufacture of water- and greaseproof papers <b>and</b> <b>cardboards.</b> These perfluorooctylsulfonyl compounds have yet to be studied. They may remain as residues in the coatings and migrate into the food.|$|R
5000|$|Recovery & Recycling: Wastes {{are also}} good sources of raw materials. Recovery and {{recycling}} of wastes can help to reduce the use of virgin materials for producing new goods. Recycling construction & demolition waste can also save the space in landfills and large amounts of materials like metals, glass, plastics, <b>and</b> <b>cardboards</b> can be recovered.|$|R

25|$|The art, science, and {{technology}} of papermaking addresses the methods, equipment, and materials {{used to make}} paper <b>and</b> <b>cardboard,</b> these being used widely for printing, writing, and packaging, among many other purposes and useful products. Today almost all paper is manufactured using industrial machinery, while handmade paper survives as a specialized craft and a medium for artistic expression.|$|E
25|$|Recyclable {{materials}} {{include many}} kinds of glass, paper, <b>and</b> <b>cardboard,</b> metal, plastic, tires, textiles, and electronics. The composting or other reuse of biodegradable waste—such as food or garden waste—is also considered recycling. Materials to be recycled are either brought to a collection center or picked up from the curbside, then sorted, cleaned, and reprocessed into new materials destined for manufacturing.|$|E

25|$|The bellows is {{the most}} {{recognizable}} part of the instrument, and the primary means of articulation. Similar to a violin's bow, the production of sound in an accordion is {{in direct proportion to}} the motion of the player. The bellows is located between the right- and left-hand manuals, and is made from pleated layers of cloth <b>and</b> <b>cardboard,</b> with added leather and metal. It is used to create pressure and vacuum, driving air across the internal reeds and producing sound by their vibration, applied pressure increasing the volume.|$|E

25|$|Lambert's book is {{fundamentally}} experimental. The forty experiments described in Photometria {{were conducted by}} Lambert between 1755 and 1760, after he decided to write a treatise on light measurement. His interest in acquiring experimental data spanned several fields: optics, thermometry, pyrometry, hydrometry, and magnetics. This interest in experimental data and its analysis, so evident in Photometria, is also present in other articles and books Lambert produced. For his optics work, extremely limited equipment sufficed: a few panes of glass, convex and concave lenses, mirrors, prisms, paper <b>and</b> <b>cardboard,</b> pigments, candles {{and the means to}} measure distances and angles.|$|E

30|$|With {{regard to}} {{wrapping}} paper <b>and</b> corrugated <b>cardboard</b> <b>and</b> plastic packaging {{from the results}} (Table  4) by model (6), we do not observe a clear substitution relationship emerging as the economic level increases. Prior research [22] reported {{that there was no}} clear replacement relationship in the United States between 1983 and 1991. The global situation including in recent years supports that in the present study. With regard to the time trend, the regression coefficient is positive and statistically significant, demonstrating the presence of other factors increasing wrapping paper <b>and</b> corrugated <b>cardboard</b> demand, such as merchandise distribution.|$|R
25|$|In 1936, {{when he was}} 30 years old, Linares {{fell ill}} with a high fever, which caused him to hallucinate. In his fever dreams, {{he was in a}} forest with rocks and clouds, many of which turned into wild, unnaturally colored creatures, {{frequently}} featuring wings, horns, tails, fierce teeth and bulging eyes. He heard a crowd of voices repeating the nonsense word “alebrije.” After he recovered, he began to re-create the creatures he'd seen, using papier-mâché <b>and</b> <b>cardboard.</b> Eventually, a Cuernavaca gallery owner discovered his work. This brought him to the attention of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, who began commissioning more alebrijes. The tradition grew considerably after British filmmaker Judith Bronowski's 1975 documentary on Linares.|$|E
25|$|Papier-mâché was {{introduced}} into Mexico around the 17th {{century as a}} way to make objects for churches with its use most developed in central Mexico. In Celaya, the creation of these figures became a trade much the way metalwork and pottery did, with the work dominated by certain families. Since this time, the technique has been used to make a wide variety of objects for both ritual, festival and decorative use, mostly by poorer indigenous and mestizo communities. The paper <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> used is mostly waste paper, such as old newspapers and boxes, with decorative elements, such as crepe paper being new. Most shapes are created with molds, then painted with acrylics.|$|E
25|$|Cin'aq (Yukon, Hooper Bay and Chevak, Lake Iliamna, and Nunivak) is cheese-like fish aged in a pit. This fish {{is usually}} dog (chum) or king (chinook) salmon. The salmon whole (except the guts) aged {{through the process}} of burying them into the marshy, muddy lowland (maraq). The hole is dug until the {{permafrost}} is exposed. The bottom of the hole is then covered with dry grass, moss, <b>and</b> <b>cardboard.</b> Then several salmon are placed in. The top of the salmon is again covered with grass, moss and or cardboard, then the remaining dug up groung is placed back into the hole, tightly covering the contents. The aged salmon fish are usually dug out during the early winter, and eaten as a delicacy.|$|E
