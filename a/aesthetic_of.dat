He also {{wanted to make sure}} that the visual style remained consistent with the Halo universe, by ensuring that the recognisable traits of the units and structures were preserved. The Banished's art style was designed to contrast visually with the UNSC. Cook wanted the Banished to be reminiscent of the Covenant, but with a greater emphasis on the <b>aesthetic</b> <b>of</b> the Brute species. Brute vehicles and weapons featured in past Halo games helped influence the design changes and creation of new technology in the Banished's arsenal.|$|E

40|$|My {{dissertation}} aims at constructing {{an environmental}} ethics theory based on environmental aesthetics {{in order to}} advocate and promote environmentally sustainable practices, policies, and lifestyles. I attempt to construct an integrated environmental aesthetics in order to inspire people’s feelings of love towards nature and motivate them to protect it.   In order to achieve this goal, I first examine the philosophical understanding and <b>aesthetic</b> appreciation <b>of</b> nature from philosophical traditions of China, which {{have an impact on}} the general public’s attitude towards nature. in chapter one of my dissertation, I point out that nature is viewed as an organic system which is always in a self-generating process of production and reproduction of life. the metaphysical foundation for this perspective of nature is ch’i. Therefore the <b>aesthetic</b> appreciation <b>of</b> nature in China is also the <b>aesthetic</b> appreciation <b>of</b> ch’i. with regard to the concept of ch’i, I focus on the following three questions: (1) what are the objective and <b>aesthetic</b> features <b>of</b> ch’i? (2) How do the Chinese appreciate <b>aesthetic</b> features <b>of</b> ch’i? (3) Why the objective features of ch’i are regarded as the objects <b>of</b> <b>aesthetic</b> appreciation? I argue that the Chinese appreciate the <b>aesthetic</b> features <b>of</b> ch’i by using intellectual intuition and that empathy is the reason why the objective features of ch’i are considered to be aesthetic features. in Chapter 2, I explain in detail the two aesthetic categories for <b>aesthetic</b> appreciation <b>of</b> nature in two major philosophical schools in China: emptiness and creativity. in Chapter 3, I examine the philosophical foundations for <b>aesthetic</b> appreciation <b>of</b> nature in the West. I first investigate the influence of traditional Western philosophy on the perceptions of nature. I argue that traditional Western philosophical thinking doesn’t support <b>aesthetic</b> appreciation <b>of</b> nature. I point out that <b>aesthetic</b> appreciation <b>of</b> nature started from eighteenth century in the West. I examine Kant’s <b>aesthetic</b> categories <b>of</b> beauty and sublime in his appreciation of nature. in contemporary world, I focus on the Allen Carlson’s positive aesthetics and Arnold Berleant’s engagement model to appreciate the beauty of environment. in Chapter 4, I evaluate the theories <b>of</b> <b>aesthetic</b> appreciation <b>of</b> nature in the West and China and attempt to construct an integrated theory <b>of</b> <b>aesthetic</b> appreciation <b>of</b> nature. the key point of this theory is to establish a caring relationship with nature based on <b>aesthetic</b> appreciation <b>of</b> nature and active participation in the beauty of it. This relationship will motivate people to protect nature and also contribute to human happiness...|$|R

5|$|The {{design that}} Pei {{developed}} for the Bank of China Tower was not only unique in appearance, but also sound enough to pass the city's rigorous standards for wind-resistance. The tower was planned around a visible truss structure, which distributed stress to {{the four corners of}} the base. Using the reflective glass that had become something of a trademark for him, Pei organized the facade around a series of boxed X shapes. At the top, he designed the roofs at sloping angles to match the rising <b>aesthetic</b> <b>of</b> the building. Some influential advocates of feng shui in Hong Kong and China criticized the design, and Pei and government officials responded with token adjustments.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Nevinson joined the Friends' Ambulance Unit and was deeply disturbed by his work tending wounded French soldiers. For a very brief period {{he served as a}} volunteer ambulance driver before ill health forced his return to Britain. Subsequently, Nevinson volunteered for home service with the Royal Army Medical Corps. He used these experiences as the subject matter for a series of powerful paintings which used the machine <b>aesthetic</b> <b>of</b> Futurism and the influence of Cubism to great effect. His fellow artist Walter Sickert wrote at the time that Nevinson's painting La Mitrailleuse, 'will probably remain the most authoritative and concentrated utterance on the war in the history of painting.' In 1917, Nevinson was appointed an official war artist, but he was no longer finding Modernist styles adequate for describing the horrors of modern war, and he increasingly painted in a more realistic manner. Nevinson's later World War One paintings, based on short visits to the Western Front, lacked the same powerful effect as those earlier works which had helped to make him {{one of the most famous}} young artists working in England.|$|E
5|$|Increased {{urbanization}} and industrialization in Europe and North America {{resulted in}} an opposing aesthetic transcendentalist movement characterized in New England by the art of Thomas Cole, Frederic Edwin Church, and other Hudson River School painters, the work of landscape architects such as Frederick Law Olmsted, and the writings of philosophers such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. As was true of other scenic areas of New England, the philosophical, artistic, and environmental movement of transcendentalism transformed the Metacomet Ridge from a commercial resource to a recreational resource. Hotels, parks, and summer estates were built on the mountains from the mid-1880s to the early 20th century. Notable structures included summit hotels and inns on Mount Holyoke, Mount Tom, Sugarloaf Mountain, and Mount Nonotuck. Parks and park structures such as Poet's Seat in Greenfield, Massachusetts, and Hubbard Park (designed {{with the help of}} Frederick Law Olmsted) of the Hanging Hills of Meriden, Connecticut, were intended as respites from the urban areas they closely abutted. Estates such as Hill-Stead and Heublein Tower were built as mountain home retreats by local industrialists and commercial investors. Although public attention gradually shifted to more remote and less developed destinations with the advent of modern transportation and the westward expansion of the United States, the physical, cultural, and historic legacy of that early recreational interest in the Metacomet Ridge still supports modern conservation efforts. Estates became museums; old hotels and the lands they occupied, frequently subject to damaging fires, became state and municipal parkland through philanthropic donation, purchase, or confiscation for unpaid taxes. Nostalgia among former guests of hotels and estates contributed to the <b>aesthetic</b> <b>of</b> conservation.|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{investigated}} neural correlates <b>of</b> <b>aesthetic</b> appreciation for paintings but {{to date the}} findings have been heterogeneous. This heterogeneity {{may be attributed to}} previous studies’ measurement <b>of</b> <b>aesthetic</b> appreciation <b>of</b> not only the beauty of paintings but also the beauty of motifs of the paintings. In order to better elucidate the beauty of paintings, it seems necessary to compare <b>aesthetic</b> appreciation <b>of</b> paintings and photographic analogues which included corresponding real images. We prepared for famous painters’ pictures and their photographic analogues which were set up to resemble each painting in order to investigate the hypothesis that there exist specific neural correlates associated with the aesthetic appreciation for paintings. Forty-four subjects participated in functional magnetic resonance study which required comparisons <b>of</b> <b>aesthetic</b> appreciation <b>of</b> paintings of still life and landscape versus photographic analogues including corresponding real images of still life and landscape. Bilateral cuneus and the left lingual gyrus were activated in the comparison <b>of</b> <b>aesthetic</b> appreciation <b>of</b> paintings versus photographic analogues.
