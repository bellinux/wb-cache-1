5|$|Throughout {{history the}} area has absorbed waves of immigrants, who have each added <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> the culture {{and history of the}} area, most notably the French Protestant Huguenots in the 17th century, the Irish in the 18th century, Ashkenazi Jews fleeing pogroms in Eastern Europe {{towards the end of the}} 19th century, and the Sylheti Bangladeshis {{community}} settling in the East End from the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The {{fall of the}} Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 at the Battle of Talikota {{started a}} slow {{disintegration}} of the Kannada speaking region into many short-lived palegar chiefdoms, and the better known Kingdom of Mysore and the kingdom of Keladi Nayakas, which were to later become important centres of Kannada literary production. These kingdoms and the Nayakas ("chiefs") of Tamil country continued to owe nominal support to a diminished Vijayanagara Empire ruling from Penukonda (1570) and later from Chandragiri (1586) in modern Andhra Pradesh, followed by {{a brief period of}} independence. By the mid-17th century, large areas in north Karnataka came {{under the control of the}} Bijapur Sultanate who waged several wars in a bid to establish a hegemony over the southern Deccan. The defeat of the Bijapur Sultanate at the hands of the Mughals in late 17th century added <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> the prevailing confusion. The constant wars of the local kingdoms with the two new rivals, the Mughals and the Marathas, and among themselves, caused further instability in the region. Major areas of Karnataka came under the rule of the Mughals and the Marathas. Under Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan, the Mysore Kingdom reached its zenith of power but had to face the growing English might who by now had a firm foothold in the subcontinent. After the death of Tipu Sultan in 1799 in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war, the Mysore Kingdom came under the British umbrella. More than a century later, with the dawn of India as an independent nation in 1947, the unification of Kannada speaking regions as modern Karnataka state brought four centuries of political uncertainty (and centuries of foreign rule) to an end.|$|E

Also, the field of osteoimmunology has emerged to further examine the interactions between the immune system, joints and bones. Epidemiological studies and medication trials are also being conducted.

25|$|Before Hus left Prague, {{he decided}} to take a step which gave <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> his endeavors. He no longer put his trust in an indecisive King, a hostile Pope or an {{ineffective}} Council. On 18 October 1412 he appealed to Jesus Christ as the supreme judge. By appealing directly to the highest Christian authority, Christ himself, he bypassed the laws and structures of the medieval Church. For the Bohemian Reformation, this step was as significant as the 95 theses nailed {{to the door of the}} Wittenberg church by Martin Luther in 1517.|$|E

25|$|Mozart {{introduced}} the newly invented clarinet {{into the chamber}} music arsenal, with the Kegelstatt Trio for viola, clarinet and piano, K. 498, and the Quintet for Clarinet and String Quartet, K. 581. He also tried other innovative ensembles, including the quintet for violin, two violas, cello, and horn, K. 407, quartets for flute and strings, and various wind instrument combinations. He wrote six string quintets for two violins, two violas and cello, which explore the rich tenor tones of the violas, adding <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> the string quartet conversation.|$|E
25|$|Brandeis was {{becoming}} increasingly conscious of and hostile to powerful corporations and {{the trend toward}} bigness in American industry and finance. He argued bigness conflicted with efficiency and added <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> the Efficiency Movement of the Progressive Era. As early as 1895 he had pointed out the harm that giant corporations could do to competitors, customers, and their own workers. The growth of industrialization was creating mammoth companies which he felt threatened the well-being of millions of Americans. Although the Sherman Anti-Trust Act was enacted in 1890, {{it was not until}} the 20th century that there was any major effort to apply it.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of the Métis added <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> conflicts {{in what is now}} Saskatchewan. In addition to violence related to the fur trade between the North West Company and Hudson's Bay Company (which ended with the merger of the two in 1821), the Métis took part in battles with the Sioux and Gros Ventre across the plains. The last battles fought in Saskatchewan, and the last battles fought in what is now Canada occurred in 1885 during the Saskatchewan Rebellion. Although small by global standards this short war {{had a profound effect on}} Canadian French-English relations, and was a defining moment in the history of the West and the Métis.|$|E

25|$|Gamow was {{a highly}} {{successful}} science writer, with several of his books still in print more than a half-century after their initial publication. As an educator, Gamow recognized and emphasized fundamental principles that were unlikely to become obsolete, even as the pace {{of science and technology}} accelerated. He also conveyed a sense of excitement with the revolution in physics and other scientific topics of interest to the common reader. Gamow himself sketched the many illustrations for his books, which added <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> and complemented what Gamow intended to convey in the text. Wherever it was essential, he was unafraid to introduce mathematics, but he tried to avoid scaring off potential readers with too many equations that did not illustrate essential points.|$|E
25|$|The Tsang {{administration}} embattled {{with the}} conservation movement which reach {{its peak in}} the late 2000s, including the protests against the demolitions of the Star Ferry Pier and the Queen's Pier. In response to it, Tsang set up a Commissioner for Heritage Office and earmarked $1billion to revitalise historic buildings. He also proposed a series of revitalisation projects that would add <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> Central. For instance, to reduce the development density of the Central Ferry Piers site and open up the public space along the waterfront for entertainment, recreational and cultural uses; to remove the Central Market from the Application List and hand {{it over to the}} Urban Renewal Authority for conservation and revitalisation; and to convert the Murray Building into a hotel through open tender etc.|$|E
25|$|Anecdotally, gay {{cruising}} {{continued in}} post-war Singapore in back alleys, public parks and toilets. In the most part, this was {{ignored by the}} police and no one was charged under section 377 of the Singapore Penal Code. Meanwhile, transvestite prostitution in Bugis Street became increasingly prominent. The State and mainstream society initially accepted it is as a vaguely undesirable but inevitable vice, similar to the pragmatic and worldly attitudes towards prostitution in the cosmopolitan port-city. With their growing fame, the transvestites of Bugis Street became a tourist attraction, drawing local and foreign visitors every night. Bugis Street and its associated transgender community were by far the most visible face of sexual minorities in the immediate post-war period, much as transgender people had been in traditional Malay society. The difference was that the community was now much more public, urban and multi-ethnic. Prostitution and interaction with international visitors also added <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> the life of this community.|$|E

25|$|As {{the band}} and its sound matured over thirty years of touring, playing, and recording, each member's stylistic {{contribution}} became more defined, consistent, and identifiable. Lesh, who was originally a classically trained trumpet player with an extensive background in music theory, did not tend to play traditional blues-based bass forms, but opted for more melodic, symphonic and complex lines, often sounding like a second lead guitar. Weir, too, was not a traditional rhythm guitarist, but tended to play jazz-influenced, unique inversions at {{the upper end of}} the Dead's sound. The two drummers, Mickey Hart and Kreutzmann, developed a unique, complex interplay, balancing Kreutzmann's steady beat with Hart's interest in percussion styles outside the rock tradition. Hart incorporated an 11-count measure to his drumming, bringing <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> the band's sound that became an important part of its emerging style. Garcia's lead lines were fluid, supple and spare, owing a great deal of their character to his training in fingerpicking and banjo.|$|E
25|$|German {{artists and}} intellectuals, heavily {{influenced}} by the French Revolution and by the great German poet and writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832), turned to Romanticism {{after a period of}} Enlightenment. Philosophical thought was decisively shaped by Immanuel Kant (1724–1804). Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827) was the leading composer of Romantic music. His use of tonal architecture {{in such a way as}} to allow significant expansion of musical forms and structures was immediately recognized as bringing <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> music. His later piano music and string quartets, especially, showed the way to a completely unexplored musical universe, and influenced Franz Schubert (1797–1828) and Robert Schumann (1810–1856). In opera, a new Romantic atmosphere combining supernatural terror and melodramatic plot in a folkloric context was first successfully achieved by Carl Maria von Weber (1786–1826) and perfected by Richard Wagner (1813–1883) in his Ring Cycle. The Brothers Grimm (1785–1863 & 1786–1859) not only collected folk stories into the popular Grimm's Fairy Tales, but were also linguists, now counted among the founding fathers of German studies. They were commissioned to begin the Deutsches Wörterbuch ("The German Dictionary"), which remains the most comprehensive work on the German language.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, hurling was a {{game played}} by Irish {{immigrants}} and discarded by their children. Many American hurling teams took to raising money to import players directly from Ireland. In recent years, this has changed considerably {{with the advent of}} the Internet and increased travel. The Barley House Wolves hurling team from New Hampshire was formed when U.S. soldiers returning from Iraq saw a hurling game on the television in Shannon Airport as their plane refuelled. Outside of the traditional North American GAA cities of New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, clubs are springing up in other places where they consist of predominantly American-born players who bring <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>to</b> the game and actively seek to promote it as a mainstream sport, especially Joe Maher, a leading expert at the sport in Boston. Currently, the Milwaukee Hurling Club, with 300 members, is the largest Hurling club in the world outside Ireland, which is made of all Americans and very few Irish immigrants. The St. Louis Gaelic Athletic Club was established in 2002 and has expanded its organization to an eight team hurling league in the spring and six team Gaelic football league in the fall. They also have a 30-member camogie league. Saint Louis has won two National Championships in Jr C Hurling (2004 and 2011), as well as two National Championships in Jr D Gaelic Football (2005, and 2013). The Indianapolis Hurling Club began in 2002, then reformed in 2005. In 2008, the Indy Hurling Club won the Junior C National Championship. In 2011, Indy had 7 club teams and sent a Junior B, Junior C and Camogie team to nationals. Hurling continues to grow in popularity with teams now in Charleston, SC, Orlando, FL, Tampa, FL, Augusta, GA, Greenville, SC, Indianapolis, IN, Worcester, MA, Corvallis, OR, Concord, NH, Portland, Maine, Twin Cities, MN, Madison, WI, Hampton Roads, VA, Rochester NY, Nashville, TN and Hartford, Connecticut.|$|E
