2500|$|Due to {{allegations}} {{brought against}} Faraci of sexual assault, Nicholson and Earwolf mutually agreed {{to put the}} podcast on an indefinite hiatus. Nicholson appeared on an episode of fellow Earwolf podcast Denzel Washington Is The Greatest Actor of All Time Period and confirmed {{that she would be}} bringing back The Canon in [...] "early spring" [...] 2017. In an announcement on April 10, 2017, <b>Amy</b> <b>said</b> Devin [...] "won't be coming back for this version" [...] but that [...] "when and if he is ready to come back, the door is open." [...] The Canon returned on April 17, 2017, featuring Nicholson and a different co-host for every episode.|$|E
60|$|<b>Amy</b> <b>said</b> nothing; {{and if she}} did {{not allow}} herself to avow that his absence was a relief, it was because she saw it was a grief and {{disappointment}} to Guy.|$|E
60|$|<b>Amy</b> <b>said</b> {{he should}} {{put him to}} learn a little Latin, and then merchants' accounts, and to write a good hand, for she would have him be put to a Turkey merchant.|$|E
5000|$|His {{contemporary}} Hardy <b>Amies</b> <b>said</b> of Morton: [...] "His {{philosophy was}} {{to transform the}} suit from the strict tailleur, or the ordinary country tweed suit with its straight up and down lines, uncompromising and fit only for the moors, into an intricately cut and carefully designed garment that was so fashionable {{that it could be}} worn with confidence at the Ritz".|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} in 2014, Sia spoke of her admiration for <b>Amy</b> Winehouse and <b>said</b> <b>Amy</b> covered the song at the Chateau Marmont Hotel and told Sia ‘That’s one of my favourite songs’." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, she has not,' <b>said</b> <b>Amy.</b> 'Dr. Mayerne <b>said</b> {{there was}} nothing really the matter: but she has been worried and out of spirits lately; and mamma {{thought it would be}} good for her to go out more.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But <b>Amy</b> <b>said</b> I must be quiet, because poor Sir Guy {{will be too}} sorrowful to like a racket; {{and when}} Amy tells me to be quiet, I know that I must, indeed.' ...|$|E
60|$|All Saturday {{morning the}} boys were {{planning}} {{how it should be}} furnished with their spoils, and when Mr. Laurie arrived, bringing an aquarium which Mrs. <b>Amy</b> <b>said</b> she was tired of, their rapture was great.|$|E
6000|$|... "So they did. Why, {{just before}} you came in <b>Amy</b> <b>said</b> they'd never had a quarrel {{in the whole of}} their married life. You know Amy. There never was a better woman in the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then he {{will want}} help all the more," [...] said Aunt Rose, {{and it sounded}} almost like mimicry of what <b>Amy</b> had <b>said</b> of old Mrs. Long.|$|R
50|$|<b>Amy</b> Poehler <b>said</b> by {{the third}} season, after the Parks Department has been shut down for three months due to a budget crisis, Leslie has started to face reality more clearly and realize the {{department}} is a low priority.|$|R
50|$|One {{participant}} <b>Amy</b> Smith <b>said</b> she was conned {{into thinking}} she was {{applying for a}} TV series similar to The Only Way is Essex but was horrified to discover that she had actually been filmed monitoring her bad driving.|$|R
6000|$|After the service, {{they stood}} talking with Mr. Ross and Mary, for some little time. Amy held apart, and Mary saw how it was. As {{they were about}} to turn homewards, <b>Amy</b> <b>said</b> quickly, 'Come and walk a little way home with me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ay! He {{shall never}} {{set eyes on}} Amy again unless all this is cleared up, which it never will be, as I desire mamma to tell her. By the bye, Philip, <b>Amy</b> <b>said</b> {{something}} of your having a slip with Charles on the stairs.' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Amy</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "What's {{all this}} story? Who could this lady be? It {{must be some}} trick, sure." [...] "No," [...] she said, [...] "it was not a trick, for she had made them take her brother home from apprentice, and bought him new clothes, and put him to have more learning; and the gentlewoman said she would make him her heir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Edwin Smithers {{was always}} a very tiresome, stupid little boy," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Amy,</b> rather crossly, from her infant school recollections.|$|R
5000|$|On August 17, 2012, The Travel Channel aired {{an episode}} of [...] "The Dead Files" [...] filmed in Smalley Inn. In the episode, the show's physic medium, <b>Amy</b> Allan, <b>said</b> she saw the {{transparent}} ghosts of a banshee and a soldier, who reportedly haunt the building.|$|R
2500|$|University of Pennsylvania President <b>Amy</b> Gutmann <b>said</b> in January 2012 {{that the}} {{university}} [...] "has clearly stated on numerous occasions {{that it does not}} support sanctions or boycotts against Israel". She said that the school was not a sponsor of a BDS conference taking place on campus in February 2012.|$|R
6000|$|The {{four young}} creatures {{had looked at}} each other mutely till the door banged and Mrs. Meyrick re-entered. Then there was an explosion. Mab clapped her hands and danced {{everywhere}} inconveniently; Mrs. Meyrick kissed Mirah and blessed her; <b>Amy</b> <b>said</b> emphatically, [...] "We can never get her a new dress before Wednesday!" [...] and Kate exclaimed, [...] "Thank heaven my table is not knocked over!" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Amy</b> <b>said</b> {{she could}} say nothing to that but this, that she was {{satisfied}} her mistress would marry nobody unless she had certain intelligence {{that he had been}} dead from somebody that saw him buried. [...] "But, alas!" [...] says Amy, [...] "my mistress was reduced to such dismal circumstances that nobody would be so foolish to think of her, unless it had been somebody to go a-begging with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dangerous {{times for}} both, but therein lay the charm; for, though <b>Amy</b> <b>said</b> to herself each night, [...] "Sick, Catholic, and a foreigner,--it can never be," [...] yet each morning she felt, with {{increasing}} force, how blank her {{day would be}} without him. And Casimer, honorably restraining every word of love, yet looked volumes, {{and in spite of}} the glasses, the girl felt the eloquence of the fine eyes they could not entirely conceal.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is the carriage,' <b>said</b> <b>Amy.</b> 'Mamma and Charlie {{have been}} to Broadstone. They thought they might meet you by the late train.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is {{only one}} thing wanting,' <b>said</b> <b>Amy.</b> 'You may sing now. You are far from Philip's hearing. Suppose we chant this afternoon's psalms.' ...|$|R
5000|$|White Shadow (2008-2010): The Guy Who Was On The Roof That One Time. Shadow was {{in charge}} of doing most of the posting to the website. On Monday, October 11, 2010, {{less than a week after}} he became engaged to his girlfriend, <b>Amy,</b> Shadow <b>said</b> {{farewell}} to the Ace & TJ radio family.|$|R
6000|$|This {{finished}} the discourse, and my lord withdrew into his study, in a humour that I {{am unable to}} describe, and left me, Amy, Thomas, and my daughter Susanna, as I must now call her, in the parlour together. We sat staring at each other some time, till at last <b>Amy</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I suppose, my lady, you have no farther business with your new daughter; she has told her story, and may now dispose of herself to the best advantage she can." [...] "No," [...] said I, [...] "I {{have nothing to say}} to her, only that she shall never be admitted into my presence again." [...] The poor girl burst out into tears, and said, [...] "Pray, my lady, excuse me, for I am certain that were you in my circumstances, you would have done the very action I have, and would expect a pardon for committing the offence." ...|$|E
60|$|The rest of {{the evening}} we spent very agreeably to me; he was {{perfectly}} good-humoured, and was at that time very merry. Then he made Amy dance with him, and I told him I would put Amy to bed to him. <b>Amy</b> <b>said,</b> with all her heart; she never had been a bride in her life. In short, he made the girl so merry that, had he not been to lie with me the same night, I believe he would have played the fool with Amy for half-an-hour, and the girl would no more have refused him than I intended to do. Yet before, I had always found her a very modest wench as any I ever saw in all my life; but, in short, the mirth of that night, and a few more such afterwards, ruined the girl's modesty for ever, as shall appear by-and-by, in its place.|$|E
60|$|I had {{conceived}} {{some hope}} that, {{if they saw}} land, we should be delivered; and I told her she did not understand things of that nature; {{that she might be}} sure if they saw land they would go directly towards it, and would make into some harbour; but it was, as <b>Amy</b> <b>said,</b> a frightful distance to it. The land looked like clouds, and the sea went as high as mountains, so that no hope appeared in the seeing the land, but we were in fear of foundering before we could reach it. This made Amy so desponding still; but as the wind, which blew from the east, or that way, drove us furiously towards the land, so when, about half-an-hour after, I stepped to the steerage-door and looked out, I saw the land much nearer than Amy represented it; so I went in and encouraged Amy again, and indeed was encouraged myself.|$|E
6000|$|... 'As {{the world}} cannot see below the surface,' <b>said</b> <b>Amy,</b> 'how distressed Laura, must be! You see, mamma {{does not say}} one word about her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is very odd,' <b>said</b> <b>Amy,</b> 'but I must dress,' {{and away}} she ran, much puzzled, {{but with no}} desire to look into Philip's secrets.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course,' <b>said</b> <b>Amy,</b> 'he {{could not}} have thought you wanted to dance with him, or {{you would not have}} gone to stir him up.' ...|$|R
60|$|I. That for my gentleman, who I had now, as I may say, in my arms, {{she said}} he had been gone from Paris, as I have hinted, having met with some great losses and misfortunes; that he had been in Holland on that very account, whither he had also carried his children; that he was after that settled for some time at Rouen; that she had been at Rouen, and found there (by a mere accident), from a Dutch skipper, that he was at London, had been there above three years; that he was to be found upon the Exchange, on the French walk; and that he lodged at St. Laurence Pountney's Lane, and the like; so <b>Amy</b> <b>said</b> she {{supposed}} I might soon find him out, but that she doubted he was poor, and not worth looking after. This she did because of the next clause, which the jade had most mind to on many accounts.|$|E
60|$|In conclusion, the sky clouded over, {{it became}} chilly, and a shower began to fall. Laura pursued Eveleen, and Amy hunted up Charlotte from the utmost {{parts of the}} field, where she was the very centre of 'winding up the clock,' and sorely against her will, dragged her off the wet grass. About sixty yards from the house, Guy met them with an umbrella, which, without speaking, he gave to Charlotte. <b>Amy</b> <b>said,</b> 'Thank you,' and again came that look. Charlotte rattled on, and hung back to talk to Guy, so that Amy could not hasten on without leaving her shelterless. It may be {{believed}} {{that she had the}} conversation to herself. At the door they met Mary and her father, going to dismiss their flock, who had taken refuge in a cart-shed {{at the other end of}} the field. Guy asked if he could be of any use; Mr. Ross said no, and Mary begged Amy and Charlotte to go up to her room, and change their wet shoes.|$|E
6000|$|Like bees {{swarming}} {{after their}} queen, mother and daughters hovered about Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to look at, wait upon, {{and listen to}} the new invalid, who was in a fair way to be killed by kindness. As he sat propped up in a big chair by Beth's sofa, with the other three close by, and Hannah popping in her head now and then 'to peek at the dear man', nothing seemed needed to complete their happiness. But something was needed, and the elder ones felt it, though none confessed the fact. Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one another with an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg. Jo had sudden fits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke's umbrella, which had been left in the hall. Meg was absent-minded, shy, and silent, started when the bell rang, and colored when John's name was mentioned. <b>Amy</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Everyone seemed waiting for something, and couldn't settle down, which was queer, since Father was safe at home," [...] and Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn't run over as usual.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, that's nothing. I only {{told you}} {{to show you what}} was the worst,' <b>said</b> <b>Amy,</b> smiling with {{recovered}} playfulness, the most re-assuring of all.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{two younger}} girls, Mabel and Helen, {{and the little}} boys,' <b>said</b> <b>Amy.</b> 'Lord de Courcy is in Ireland, {{and all the others}} are away.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, mamma; {{after all}} our {{looking forward to}} it,' <b>said</b> <b>Amy.</b> 'Oh! yes,' and her voice lost its piteous tone, 'it is a real sacrifice.' ...|$|R
