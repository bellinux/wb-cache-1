5|$|In caecilians, {{fertilisation}} is internal, {{the male}} extruding an intromittent organ, the phallodeum, and inserting {{it into the}} female cloaca.

5|$|Surface {{tension is}} the elastic {{tendency}} of <b>a</b> <b>fluid</b> surface {{which makes it}} acquire the least surface area possible. Surface tension allows insects (e.g. water striders), usually denser than water, to float and stride on a water surface.|$|E

5|$|The English-speaking {{countries}} {{also used}} {{a system of}} units of fluid measure, or in modern terminology volume units, based on the apothecaries' system. A volume of liquid that was approximately that of an apothecaries' ounce of water was called <b>a</b> <b>fluid</b> ounce, and was divided into fluid drachms and sometimes also fluid scruples. The analogue of the grain was called a minim.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} this is that the {{pressure}} difference across <b>a</b> <b>fluid</b> interface is proportional to the mean curvature, as seen in the Young–Laplace equation. For an open soap film, the pressure difference is zero, hence the mean curvature is zero, and minimal surfaces have the property of zero mean curvature.|$|E
5|$|This {{effect was}} {{exploited}} in the Tesla turbine, patented by Nikola Tesla in 1913. It {{is referred to}} as a bladeless turbine because it uses the boundary layer effect and not <b>a</b> <b>fluid</b> impinging upon the blades as in a conventional turbine. Boundary layer turbines are also known as cohesion-type turbine, bladeless turbine, and Prandtl layer turbine (after Ludwig Prandtl).|$|E

5|$|Vortex {{streets are}} zigzagging {{patterns}} of whirling vortices {{created by the}} unsteady separation of flow of <b>a</b> <b>fluid,</b> most often air or water, over obstructing objects.

5|$|A lattice gas {{automaton}} is {{a cellular}} automaton designed {{to simulate the}} motion of particles in <b>a</b> <b>fluid</b> or an ideal gas. In such a system, gas particles move on straight lines with constant velocity, until undergoing elastic collision with other particles. Lattice gas automata simplify these models by only allowing a constant number of velocities (typically, only one speed and either four or six directions of motion) and by simplifying the types of collision that are possible.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} space-related {{application of}} americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It {{relies on the}} very high rate of nuclear fission of 242mAm, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. The fission products of 242mAm can either directly propel the spaceship or they can heat up a thrusting gas; they can also transfer their energy to <b>a</b> <b>fluid</b> and generate electricity through a magnetohydrodynamic generator.|$|E

5|$|By the 2005–06 season, {{clubs in}} England were {{increasingly}} {{in favour of}} using the 4–5–1 system. Wenger, having earlier suggested he would never resort to a negative system, later adopted the formation for Champions League matches. The decision to pack the midfield and play a lone striker resulted in Arsenal reaching the final. With Fábregas breaking into the first team, Wenger chose to deviate from their counter-attacking style, to a more possession based one. In 2009–10, he instituted <b>a</b> <b>fluid</b> 4–3–3 formation to benefit from Fàbregas' creativity, and since the player's departure, had remodelled the system to 4–1–4–1 and 4–2–3–1. During {{the latter half of}} the 2016–17 Premier League season, Wenger switched to a 3-4-3 formation first used against Middlesbrough in a 1-2 win.|$|E
5|$|Earth {{has evolved}} through {{geological}} and biological processes that have left {{traces of the}} original conditions. The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with {{a thick layer of}} plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and <b>a</b> <b>fluid</b> outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{returned}} {{to the problem of}} thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in <b>a</b> <b>fluid</b> at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.|$|E
50|$|The Richtmyer-Meshkov {{instability}} (RMI) {{occurs when}} two fluids of different density are impulsively accelerated. Normally {{this is by}} {{the passage of a}} shock wave. The development of the instability begins with small amplitude perturbations which initially grow linearly with time. This is followed by a nonlinear regime with bubbles appearing in the case of <b>a</b> light <b>fluid</b> penetrating <b>a</b> heavy <b>fluid,</b> and with spikes appearing in the case of <b>a</b> heavy <b>fluid</b> penetrating <b>a</b> light <b>fluid.</b> <b>A</b> chaotic regime eventually is reached and the two fluids mix. This instability can be considered the impulsive-acceleration limit of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.|$|R

5|$|His {{early works}} in dynamics, {{the science of}} motion and {{mechanics}} were his circa 1590 Pisan De Motu (On Motion) and his circa 1600 Paduan Le Meccaniche (Mechanics). The former was based on Aristotelian–Archimedean fluid dynamics and held that the speed of gravitational fall in <b>a</b> <b>fluid</b> medium was proportional to the excess of a body's specific weight over that of the medium, whereby in a vacuum, bodies would fall with speeds in proportion to their specific weights. It also subscribed to the Philoponan impetus dynamics in which impetus is self-dissipating and free-fall in a vacuum would have an essential terminal speed according to specific weight after an initial period of acceleration.|$|E
5|$|In early May, the ANZAC {{positions}} had sufficiently stabilised {{such that}} the New Zealand Infantry Brigade was transferred to Cape Helles for operations there. Malone led his battalion during the Second Battle of Krithia, during which he came into conflict with his brigade commander, Colonel Francis Johnston, who had taken over command of the brigade from Walker. Johnston ordered a bayonet charge by the Wellington Battalion although Malone pointed out to Johnston the lack of flanking support for such a charge. Johnston was a British Army officer seconded to the NZEF, and in his private correspondence, Malone was beginning to express frustration at the inflexibility of such officers {{in the face of}} <b>a</b> <b>fluid</b> battlefield situation. Malone was later mentioned in dispatches for his work at Cape Helles.|$|E
5|$|Laminar {{boundary}} layers can be loosely classified {{according to}} their structure and {{the circumstances under which}} they are created. The thin shear layer which develops on an oscillating body {{is an example of a}} Stokes boundary layer, while the Blasius boundary layer refers to the well-known similarity solution near an attached flat plate held in an oncoming unidirectional flow and Falkner–Skan boundary layer, a generalization of Blasius profile. When <b>a</b> <b>fluid</b> rotates and viscous forces are balanced by the Coriolis effect (rather than convective inertia), an Ekman layer forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a thermal boundary layer occurs. A surface can have multiple types of boundary layer simultaneously.|$|E

5|$|Meanders are sinuous bends in rivers {{or other}} channels, which form as <b>a</b> <b>fluid,</b> most often water, flows around bends. As {{soon as the}} path is {{slightly}} curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as helical flow drags material like sand and gravel across the river {{to the inside of}} the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so erosion accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful positive feedback loop.|$|E
5|$|Nemerteans lack {{specialized}} gills, and respiration occurs {{over the}} surface of the body, which is long and sometimes flattened. Like other animals with thick body walls, they use fluid circulation rather than diffusion to move substances through their bodies. The circulatory system consists of the rhynchocoel and peripheral vessels, while blood of other invertebrates is contained in the main body cavity. The fluid in the rhynchocoel moves substances to and from the proboscis, and functions as <b>a</b> <b>fluid</b> skeleton in everting the proboscis and in burrowing. The vessels circulate fluid round the whole body and the rhynchocoel provides its own local circulation. The circulatory vessels are a system of coeloms.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, 1905, {{before the}} start of the 1905–06 season, Stuart was {{suspended}} from the league after the western teams complained that he had won too many championships and was too rough for the league. He was reinstated by the league on December 30, and joined the Pittsburgh Professionals. After Pittsburgh finished their season, Stuart joined Calumet for one game so they could try to win the league championship, which they lost to the Portage Lakes Hockey Club. Once again he was named best cover-point in the IPHL as he scored eleven goals.
