In addition, from seasons seven through nine, these teams would also be forced to give up all their bags and possessions therein, leaving them with only the clothes on their backs and the fanny pack teams use to carry their passports and Race documentation; this latter penalty caused many teams, thinking themselves to be in last place, to wear as much clothing as possible before checking in.|$|E
25|$|When in 1551 the {{mismanagement}} of Sir William Dansell, King's Merchant to the Low Countries, {{had caused the}} English Government much financial embarrassment, the authorities called Gresham for advice, thereafter following his proposals. Gresham advocated the adoption of various methods– highly ingenious, but quite arbitrary and unfair— for raising {{the value of the}} pound sterling on the bourse of Antwerp which proved so successful that {{in just a few years}} King Edward VI had discharged almost all of his debts. The Government sought Gresham's advice in <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>money</b> difficulties, and also frequently employed him in various diplomatic missions. He had no stated salary, but in reward of his services received from King Edward various grants of lands, the annual value of which at that time amounted ultimately to about 400 pounds a year.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{were made}} to {{regularise}} the financial position of the company, but it was unable to escape from its difficulty and went into receivership {{for a second time}} in 1889. By then it had become obvious that continuing inaction was impossible, and discussion had taken place with the Great Western Railway with a view to the larger company buying the Wye Valley concern. The unsatisfactory situation dragged on, and finally in December 1904 the sale was agreed. The GWR was to pay 2.5% of face value on ordinary shares, and 12.5% on preference shares. Ordinary shareholders had thus lost nearly <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>money.</b> The sale took formal effect on 1 July 1905. As the GWR had been working the line from the beginning, there was no obvious outward change so far as the travelling public were concerned.|$|E

At {{the beginning of his}} regency, Philip, in the king's name, confirmed all the privileges of the Jews, and in 1325 bestowed on them the right of citizenship. He protected them from forcible baptism, and strictly forbade the baptism of their children against the parents' will. Permission was granted them (1331) to build a new synagogue in their quarter, but {{it was not to be}} too elaborate. As one means of preventing the erection of a handsome building, Jaime collected <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>money</b> into the state treasury. Under Pedro IV (1336–87), who in 1344 united Majorca with the kingdom of Aragon, the Jews of the Balearic Isles lived unmolested, with all their rights safeguarded; but at the time of the hostile agitations against the Jews in Spain their peaceful condition likewise came to an end.|$|E
