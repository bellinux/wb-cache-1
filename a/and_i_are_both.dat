500|$|Cody {{said she}} wanted the film to speak to female {{empowerment}} and explore the complex relationships between best friends. [...] "(Director) Karyn Kusama <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> outspoken feminists", she said. [...] "We wanted to subvert the classic horror model of women being terrorized. I want to write roles that service women. I want to tell stories from a female perspective. I want to create good parts for actresses where they're not just accessories to men." [...] Addressing [...] "the male-dominated" [...] horror genre, Cody said [...] "a key reason for writing the film was {{to bring to the}} screen a new way of expressing the intensity of female bonds" [...] and that the adolescent female friendships she experienced were unparalleled in their intensity. She wanted to show the [...] "almost horrific" [...] aspect of such devotion and its relation to parasitism.|$|E
500|$|While {{working on}} the album, Mars said: [...] "I'm never singing another ballad again," [...] but {{that came from the}} gut – it's the most honest, real thing I've ever sung," [...] he says. [...] "When there are no safe bets, that's when I feel my blood move." [...] He also shared how {{important}} the lyrics to this song are for him when he posted a photograph of Unorthodox Jukeboxs artwork via his Twitter account. [...] "Soon you guys will hear a song I wrote called When I Was Your Man. I've never been this nervous. Can't explain it," [...] he tweeted. Philip Lawrence explained the inspiration of the song: [...] "I think Bruno <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> huge fans of older music, like Billy Joel and Elton John. We always loved those moments where you can sit at the piano and emote. Those intimate moments when an artist is so naked and vulnerable; you can’t help but be drawn to it. We always wanted to find a stripped down song like that, which is how that song came to be. The subject matter was real life; Bruno had experienced that, so we tried to say it in the best and catchiest way we could." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Rather," [...] she answered, with {{a little}} laugh. [...] "What a stroke of luck it was meeting you here! Flo <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> stony. We hadn't a {{sovereign}} between us when we'd paid for our tickets." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{agreed with}} her. <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> {{dreading}} that call all day. It isn't {{a very pleasant}} thing {{to go to a}} man you have recently refused to marry and ask him for money; <b>and</b> Melissa <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> in that predicament.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the same}} time, Jaco <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> really {{on a mission}} {{to find a way to}} play and find a way to present our {{instruments}} in an improvisational environment that expressed our dissatisfaction with the status quo at the time. Pat Metheny ...|$|R

60|$|Of {{course the}} {{engagement}} between us <b>is</b> to continue, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{sure you know}} me too well to suppose that I have ever had a thought to the contrary.

6000|$|My wife <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> so fond {{of country}} life and country pursuits that month after month passed by at our little farm in a {{succession}} of delightful days. Time flew like a [...] "limited express" [...] train, and it was September before we knew it.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{comes of}} a smooth tongue, Floating Tom," [...] exclaimed Hurry, grating {{his teeth in}} pure resentment--"This comes of a smooth tongue, and a silly gal's inclinations, and you had best look into the matter! You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> prisoners--" [...] Hurry could recall that {{circumstance}} now--"you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> prisoners <b>and</b> yet Judith never stirred an inch to do us any sarvice! She is bewitched with this lank-looking Deerslayer, and he, and she, and you, and all of us, had best look to it. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not a man {{to put up with}} such a wrong quietly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> say, all the parties had best look to it! Let's up kedge, old fellow, and move nearer to this p'int, and see how matters are getting on." ...|$|R
6000|$|Deringham {{watched her}} closely. [...] "I only wished you to {{understand}} the position, and to remember that you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> to some extent {{at the mercy of}} our rancher kinsman," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not. Miss Marrable <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> {{remarkable}} for the firmness of our characters. When we say Mr. So-and-So is positively to act {{the part of}} Falkland, we positively mean it. Come in and be introduced." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My brother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> good swimmers, {{and we will}} do {{that part}} of the work. The hardest part will be getting it up, and {{you will be able to}} give us your help at that." ...|$|E
40|$|Eyvind Wichmann <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> {{graduate}} students at Columbia University in the fifties, {{a decade of}} remarkable creativity by a star-studded physics faculty, which included some ten Nobel Laureates.

6000|$|... 'Yes, I know,' said Mary; 'Frank <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> very sorry, <b>and</b> {{we would}} have found her another place, but she would go home. You see, we could not keep her in the nursery, for {{we must have a}} {{thoroughly}} trustworthy person to go out with Michael.' ...|$|R
5000|$|It's {{a terribly}} old music hall joke. I {{did that to}} make the crew laugh and Mel Brooks said, 'Let's shoot it' ... Wilder <b>and</b> <b>I</b> both said, 'Mel, please take that out', and he left it in. He said, 'I think it's funny'. Audiences laugh at it. Gene <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> wrong. Mel <b>was</b> right.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> seconds--and {{these two}} gentlemen can {{obviously}} fight {{in front of}} us. You, he-he, are the king. I am God; really, they could hardly have better supporters. They {{have come to the}} right place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am. Ingua <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> {{children}} of nature. The {{only difference is}} that I am older and have been taught diplomacy and self-control, which she still lacks. I mask my feelings, while Ingua frankly displays hers. That's why I am attracted to her." ...|$|E
60|$|ATTEN. I {{think you}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> of a mind; for just now I was {{thinking}} {{to call you}} back to him also. And pray now, since it is your own motion to return again to him, let us discourse {{a little more of}} his quiet and still death.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{was glad}} to have her off his hands on any terms. Besides, to tell you the truth, John, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{convinced}} he had no notion you would ever come home again.

6000|$|... "Phil {{said that}} no one could {{possibly}} live on the West Side--of course the fact that he <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> living on the West Side doesn't count--and the cheapest good apartments near Fifth Avenue cost four thousand dollars a year. And then one can't possibly get along with less than two cars and four maids and a chauffeur. Can't be done!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was sure}} {{it would come to}} this, in the end," [...] remarked the old cab-horse. [...] "Folks don't fall {{into the middle of the}} earth and then get back again to tell of their adventures--not in real life. And the whole thing has been unnatural because that cat <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> able to talk your language, and to {{understand}} the words you say." ...|$|E

60|$|We {{understood}} {{from what}} followed that Mr. Skimpole {{was to be}} left until the morning to occupy the two places which had been already paid for.

6000|$|... "True, but he {{has cost}} us heavily in time {{which might have been}} spent in good hunting, in wounds, in hair--I am half plucked along my back--and last of all, in honor.

All this, man-cub, came of thy playing with the Bandar-log." ...|$|R
