They reformed in 1975, releasing Godbluff and frequently touring Italy again, before a major line-up change {{and a slight}} rename to Van der Graaf. The band split in 1978. After many years apart, the band finally united at a gig at the Royal Festival Hall and a short tour in 2005. Since then, the band has continued as <b>a</b> <b>trio</b> <b>of</b> Hammill, Banton, and Evans, who record and tour regularly in between Hammill's concurrent solo career.|$|E

5|$|Chocolatier was {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Big Splash Games, <b>a</b> <b>trio</b> <b>of</b> video game designers, who remained employees whilst developing a prototype game in their spare time. This prototype was rejected by publishers, but after {{coming up with the}} premise of Chocolatier the team was signed-up by PlayFirst and completed the title. The game received a mostly positive reception: reviewers enjoyed the action mini-game which is played when chocolates are manufactured, and the game's graphics, sound, and Victorian-era presentation.|$|E
5|$|Former player Terry Neill succeeded Mee in 1976. At {{the age of}} 34, {{he became}} the {{youngest}} Arsenal manager to date. With new signings like Malcolm Macdonald and Pat Jennings, and a crop of talent in the side such as Liam Brady and Frank Stapleton, the club reached <b>a</b> <b>trio</b> <b>of</b> FA Cup finals (1978, 1979 and 1980), and lost the 1980 European Cup Winners' Cup Final on penalties. The club's only trophy during this time was a last-minute 3–2 victory over Manchester United in the 1979 FA Cup Final, widely regarded as a classic.|$|E

This {{would be the first}} of <b>a</b> <b>trio</b> <b>of</b> league titles, with the 1907–08 and 1908–09 league titles to follow.|$|E

The film {{centers on}} <b>a</b> <b>trio</b> <b>of</b> {{homeless}} persons in Tokyo who discover {{a baby on}} Christmas Eve {{and set out to}} search for her parents. Tokyo Godfathers cost more to make than Kon's previous two films (with a budget of approximately 300,000,000 yen), and centered on the themes of homelessness and abandonment, with a comedic touch worked in. The screenplay was written by Keiko Nobumoto.|$|E
5|$|On October 16, 2004, Donald Trump and Hollinger International, {{the parent}} company of the Chicago Sun-Times, {{completed}} the $73million sale of the former home of the newspaper a week after it relocated.

5|$|The Tour of Oman is {{the third}} of <b>a</b> <b>trio</b> <b>of</b> stage races in the Middle East that come early in the road cycling season, {{following}} the Dubai Tour and the Tour of Qatar, in 2015 won by Mark Cavendish and Niki Terpstra respectively. The distinctive feature of the Tour of Oman is the annual inclusion of the climb of Jebel Akhdar, the Green Mountain, which means the general classification is generally won by climbers. Many Grand Tour contenders start their seasons racing in Oman for this reason.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>trio</b> <b>of</b> small Early Classic temples (Temples 29 to 31) stand upon {{a common}} {{platform}} {{at the east}} end of the terrace, facing west. It is likely that the platform was purposely built to support the three temples that were built more-or-less simultaneously. Neither the platform nor the temples have been investigated; it is therefore possible that an early version of the central temple (Temple 30) was built first, then decommissioned with the platform being built to cover the early version, followed by {{the construction of a new}} version plus the two additional flanking temples.|$|E
5|$|Another stock {{plot device}} in the 1970s was the gay {{character}} in a police drama. They served as victims of blackmail or anti-gay violence, but more often as criminals. Beginning in the late 1960s with N.Y.P.D., Police Story, and Police Woman, the use of homosexuals in stories became much more prevalent, according to Vito Russo, {{as a response to}} their higher profiles in gay activism. Lesbians were included as villains, motivated to murder by their desires, internalized homophobia, or fear of being exposed as homosexual. One episode of Police Woman earned protests by the National Gay Task Force before it aired for portraying <b>a</b> <b>trio</b> <b>of</b> murderous lesbians who killed retirement home patients for their money. NBC edited the episode because of the protests, but a sit-in was staged in the head of NBC's offices.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in five {{movements in}} a symmetrical arrangement of two framing duets surrounding recitatives and a central aria. Bach scored {{the work for}} two vocal soloists (soprano (S) and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of originally two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, notes that the scoring for just two voices and strings was probably intended to ease the workload of musicians who had a busy time during the Christmas season. In the later version, Bach added <b>a</b> <b>trio</b> <b>of</b> two oboes (Ob) and taille (Ot). The duration is given as 17 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlain {{was traded}} to the St. Louis Browns in August 1888, having already {{registered}} 14 wins for the Colonels that year. He earned 11 more wins in the last six weeks of the season. He struck out 176 batters and registered a 2.19 earned run average that season, good for fifth among the league's pitchers. The Browns finished 1888 with a fourth consecutive league pennant. However, not long after Chamberlain joined the club, pitcher Nat Hudson left the team to get married. In the World Series, the Browns had only Chamberlain and pitcher Silver King to face <b>a</b> <b>trio</b> <b>of</b> New York Giants pitchers that included future Hall of Famer Tim Keefe.|$|E

5|$|Freshman Sam Richardson {{came into}} the game the starter at quarterback, a role he held since the Cyclones' 53–21 win against the Kansas Jayhawks, which made them bowl eligible. Iowa State's leading rusher coming into the game was junior running back James White, who amassed 505 rushing yards during the season. One yard behind White with 504 rushing yards was Shontrelle Johnson, another junior running back. In the {{receiving}} game, Iowa State was led by <b>a</b> <b>trio</b> <b>of</b> senior wide receivers, Aaron Horne, Chris Young, and Josh Lenz, who totaled 39, 38, and 31 receptions respectively. Iowa State's offensive line had a few question marks coming into the game, including at right tackle where sophomore Jacob Gannon had made his first career start in the previous game. In total, Iowa State ranked 80 out of 120 in total offense averaging 364.2 yards per game.|$|E
