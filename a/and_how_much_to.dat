If there are competing offers for the same guide in a particular region, the highest offer receives all of that region's diamonds in an all-pay auction. Competing agents can be bribed to reveal inside information regarding the competitor's decisions. Complicating matters further is the UN inspector, who moves at random between regions on each turn. The inspector blocks all diamond extraction from the region {{in which he is}} present, and can confiscate diamonds from agents within that region. Like other agents though, the inspector can be bribed and directed to regions of a player's choice.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} of winning players {{is not to}} win every individual hand, but rather to make mathematically and psychologically better decisions regarding when <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> bet, raise, call—or fold. By making such decisions to place influential bets, one can non-verbally represent or suggest holding or not-holding a certain or possible hand by either betting or not-betting pre-flop, and by venturing smaller or larger bets or raises at possibly more advantageous times, throughout the stages of the hand being dealt. One's pattern of betting may encourage opponents to bet or to fold (in this complex process, called bluffing), without verbalizing a discouraging or dishonest word. The winning poker players know how to enhance their opponents' betting and maximize their own expected gain on each round of betting, to thereby increase their long-term winnings.|$|E

Bathroom attendants monitor the restrooms on behalf of management; primarily watching for policy violations and potential liability concerns. In strip clubs, policy enforcement can range from watching for drug use, sex, fighting, and other activities the club would prefer to see done off the premises. The attendant will also attempt to keep the restroom area clean, assist with the washing of hands, and if available, provide by request an assortment of cologne, mints, and other disposable items.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{problems}} associated with water-logged and wet soils, it is important for viticulturist to know how much water is currently in the soil before deciding if <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> irrigate. There are several methods of evaluating soil moisture. The most basic is simple observation and feeling of the soil, however this has its limitations since the subsoil may be moist while the surface soil appears dry. More specific measurements can be attained by using tensiometers which evaluates surface tension of water extracted from the soil. The presence of water in the soil can be measured by neutron moisture meters that utilize an aluminium tube with an internal neutron source that detect the subtle change between the water in the soil. Similarly, gypsum block placed throughout the vineyard contain an electrode {{that can be used to}} detect the electrical resistance that occurs as the soil dries and water is released by evaporation. Since the 1990s there has been greater research into tools utilizing time-domain reflectometry and capacitance probes. In addition to monitoring for excessive moisture, viticulturists also keep an eye for signs of water stress (discussed below) due to severe lack of water.|$|E

500|$|Pulmonary {{contusion}} received further attention during World War II, {{when the}} bombings of Britain caused blast injuries and associated respiratory problems in both soldiers and civilians. Also during this time, studies with animals placed at varying distances from a blast showed that protective gear could prevent lung injuries. These findings suggested that an impact {{to the outside}} of the chest wall was responsible for the internal lesions. In 1945, studies identified a phenomenon termed [...] "wet lung", in which the lungs accumulated fluid and were simultaneously less able to remove it. They attributed the respiratory failure often seen in blunt chest trauma in part to excessive fluid resuscitation, and the question of whether <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> administer fluids has remained controversial ever since.|$|E

Inferring from their faulty maps that the distances to each were about equal, they decided to try for the bigger depot at Cape Flora. Strindberg took more pictures during this week than he would at any later point, including 12 frames that make up a 360-degree panorama of the crash site.|$|E
500|$|Historian Allan Nevins, in his {{foreword}} to Walters' {{biography of}} Foraker, suggested that Foraker did not attain the presidency, {{as he had}} hoped, because of the ambitions of other Ohio politicians. While Foraker might have secured the nomination in 1888 as a compromise candidate, had not his pledges to Sherman prevented it, having [...] "stood aside for an older man year after year he was compelled to stand aside for younger leaders. [...] First McKinley, with Hanna at his side, was given precedence; then Taft, whom Foraker had given a start in public life, scaled the peak. [...] Foraker, for all his administrative capacity, his wide popular appeal, and his unflinching courage, had the tragic lot of seeing a succession of associates go above him." [...] Even Foraker's final defeat, in 1914, proved {{to be part of}} the political rise of another president from Ohio, Harding. Nevins noted the aggressive nature of Foraker's political style, and commented, [...] "How much of his failure to reach high office was attributable to ill fortune <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> some of his traits, readers … may judge for themselves." [...] Cincinnati editor Murat Halstead, a contemporary, attributed the fact that Foraker did not get nominated in 1888 to the surplus of ambitious Ohio men at the convention: [...] in addition to Sherman, Foraker, and McKinley, even Harrison had been born in Ohio.|$|E

2500|$|Lord of the Rings Online {{employs a}} {{mechanism}} called [...] "tapping," [...] {{which is a}} way for the game to detect who attacked an enemy. [...] The game can then decide, based on who attacked an enemy first, who to give experience to <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> give. [...] If players try to power-level, they will find that the high-level character will absorb most of the experience (frequently going to waste), and the low-level character will receive just {{a small fraction of the}} experience for the defeat of the enemy, even if the characters are not in a group. [...] The main problem with this method is that it discourages players from helping other players if they randomly stumble upon each other. [...] For example, if one player is fighting an enemy and is losing the fight, and another player stumbles upon the fight and helps the nearly-defeated player, the nearly-defeated player will lose most of the experience from victory over the enemy. [...] In the past, this has caused tension between players who appreciate the help and players who would rather suffer defeat than the loss of the experience reward.|$|E
