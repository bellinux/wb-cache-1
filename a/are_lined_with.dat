5|$|The {{mouth is}} {{at the base of}} the lophophore. Food passes through the mouth, muscular pharynx ("throat") and {{oesophagus}} ("gullet"), all of which <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> cilia and cells that secrete mucus and digestive enzymes. The stomach wall has branched ceca ("pouches") where food is digested, mainly within the cells.|$|E
5000|$|Sections of {{the inner}} German border <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> a 3 m (10 ft) high {{electric}} fence to deter potential defectors from East Germany.

50|$|The northern, rear {{facade of}} the building, <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> a modern steel framed {{verandah}} which {{is linked to the}} rear verandahs of the adjacent buildings on the site. This facade <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> early timber framed window openings and early doors, with some more recent penetrations.|$|R
5|$|Most {{molluscs}} with shells {{can produce}} pearls, {{but only the}} pearls of bivalves and some gastropods, whose shells <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> nacre, are valuable. The best natural pearls are produced by marine pearl oysters, Pinctada margaritifera and Pinctada mertensi, which live in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific Ocean. Natural pearls form when a small foreign object gets stuck between the mantle and shell.|$|E
5|$|A more {{traditional}} Serbian nightlife experience, accompanied by traditional music known as Starogradska (roughly translated as Old Town Music), typical of northern Serbia's urban environments, is most prominent in Skadarlija, the city's old bohemian neighborhood where the poets and artists of Belgrade {{gathered in the}} 19th and early 20th centuries. Skadar Street (the centre of Skadarlija) and the surrounding neighbourhood <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> some of Belgrade's best and oldest traditional restaurants (called kafanas in Serbian), which date back to that period. At {{one end of the}} neighbourhood stands Belgrade's oldest beer brewery, founded {{in the first half of}} the 19th century. One of the city's oldest kafanas is the Znak pitanja("?").|$|E
5|$|Presidents Hall– One of {{the oldest}} {{buildings}} on campus and a flagship of the University, Presidents Hall was completed in 1867. Located at {{the epicenter of the}} main campus, Presidents Hall is a neo-gothic structure dressed in brownstone. It originally served as a seminary but now houses the University’s administration including the Office of the University President. The halls <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> portraits of past University presidents and include a large stained glass depicting Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton, which was commissioned in 1866 by President Bayley.|$|E

5|$|The {{systemic}} {{heart has}} muscular contractile walls {{and consists of}} a single ventricle and two atria, one for {{each side of the}} body. The blood vessels consist of arteries, capillaries and veins and <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> a cellular endothelium which is quite unlike that of most other invertebrates. The blood circulates through the aorta and capillary system, to the vena cavae, after which the blood is pumped through the gills by the auxiliary hearts and back to the main heart. Much of the venous system is contractile, which helps circulate the blood.|$|E
5|$|At {{the south}} end of {{corridor}} lies an antechamber, which is located directly under the tip of the pyramid. The antechamber is oriented on the east–west axis and leads west to the king's burial chamber. The burial chamber has the same height and width as the antechamber, but is longer. At the western end of the burial chamber Perring discovered some fragments of an empty and undercorated black basalt sarcophagus which had been originally placed in a slight depression as well as a canopic chest. The chambers are protected from the pyramid weight by a gabled ceiling made of two large Tura limestone blocks, an architecture common to all pyramids of the 5th and 6th dynasties. The chambers <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> the same material, while the floor pavement was lost to stone robbers.|$|E
5|$|Perennial and {{seasonal}} streams often <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> live oak and sycamore, which transition into the riparian zones {{of the main}} stem Santa Ana River. The inland riparian marshes upstream of the Riverside/Orange County line, although degraded by pollution, have otherwise been mostly left in their natural state. Although much of the riparian system along the river has been degraded, {{one of the largest}} places where it occurs is the enormous marsh behind Prado Dam, an area closed to development because it functions as a flood control basin, similar to the Sepulveda Dam. The Santa Ana sucker, a small bottom-dwelling fish, once was found throughout riparian zones, but now is rarely seen in the Santa Ana River drainage. Near the mouth, the river was once abundant in salt marshes, which stretched for miles {{on either side of the}} river, even near Upper Newport Bay, which has also served as an alternate mouth of the river.|$|E

5|$|The {{banks of}} Pine Creek and Spring Creek <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> large rock and cliff {{formations}} that provide habitat to plants ranging from large trees to moss to hanging vines. The cliffs harbor plants {{rare in the}} state of Illinois such as Canada yew and sullivantia (family Saxifragaceae), an Illinois state-threatened species. When in season, the park's many species of wildflowers bloom, some of the flowers found in the park include: trout lily, Solomon's seal, bloodroot, blue-eyed grass, spring beauty, and hepatica. The forest undergrowth provides small mammal habitat and among the mammals that {{can be seen in the}} park are: red squirrels, raccoons, deer, and chipmunks. Birds include, the pine thrush, warblers, wild turkey, and winter-migratory birds. The creeks are populated with smallmouth bass, rock bass, channel catfish and, when they are stocked by the IDNR, rainbow trout.|$|E
5|$|The {{eastern part}} of Terengganu {{district}} that faces the South China Sea is characterised by sandy coastal beaches that cover the entire stretch of both parts. Small bays and coastal plains can be found. The district is divided into four major drainage basins: Terengganu River basin, Nerus River basin, Ibai River basin, and other small rivers basin. Certain parts of the rivers of Kuala Terengganu <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> swamp forests. Hills between 200–600 metres mostly dominate {{the western part of}} the district, with more than 70% of the district made up of lowlands less than 20 metres high because of its geographical proximity to the coast. The city itself has a few high points with the highest being Bukit Besar, followed by Bukit Kecil. Bukit Puteri is centrally located in the city, just near the Terengganu River estuary. The lowlands provide the district with suitable areas for plantations such as paddy, palm oil trees, and rubber trees.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{district}} is densely developed, primarily residential in its {{northern and southern}} portions, with commercial use concentrated in central blocks near Monument Square. The only significant open spaces within it are the one-block Washington Park near its southern end and Seminary Park, the main quad at Russell Sage. Most of the major streets and the central area of the district <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> multi-story dwellings that are primarily commercial but {{with a mix of}} office and residential space on their upper floors. On the side streets, there are smaller-scale residential townhouses. Institutional use is limited to Russell Sage, a few churches, RPI's buildings and governmental structures like the county courthouse and post office. No industrial use, past or present, is within the district, with the notable exception of the Gurley Building, and even that has been scaled back in recent years.|$|E

5|$|The larger arteries {{throughout}} the brain supply blood to smaller capillaries. These smallest {{of blood vessels}} in the brain, <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> cells joined by tight junctions and so fluids do not seep in or leak out to the same degree as they do in other capillaries, thereby creating the blood-brain barrier. Pericytes {{play a major role in}} the formation of the tight junctions. The barrier is less permeable to larger molecules, but is still permeable to water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and most fat-soluble substances (including anaesthetics and alcohol). The blood-brain barrier is not present in areas of the brain that may need to respond to changes in body fluids, such as the pineal gland, area postrema, and some areas of the hypothalamus. There is a similar blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, which serves the same purpose as the blood–brain barrier, but facilitates the transport of different substances into the brain due to the distinct structural characteristics between the two barrier systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{library is}} on the right of the hall, removed from the other rooms; it once held a billiard table. The walls <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> tall bookcases {{containing}} rare books; the walls were otherwise covered in large square panel-like pieces of leather. The room has a richly coffered ceiling and had green and brown curtains. The house has bedrooms of various sizes, most large, with Mrs. Shepard's the biggest. Each room has distinct furnishings and from moderate to rich decoration. One particular was the Moorish room, furnished in the Moorish style, with mantel and furniture inlaid with mother of pearl. The third floor had bedrooms, a children's suite and a large playroom.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{is small}} in {{relation}} {{to the size of the}} animal. The jaws <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> spatulate (chisel-like) teeth suited to an herbivorous diet. The snout of Apatosaurus and similar diplodocoids is squared, with only Nigersaurus having a squarer skull. The braincase of Apatosaurus is well preserved in specimen BYU17096, which also preserved much of the skeleton. A phylogenetic analysis found that the braincase had a morphology similar to those of other diplodocoids. Some skulls of Apatosaurus have been found still in articulation with their teeth. Those teeth that have the enamel surface exposed do not show any scratches on the surface; instead, they display a sugary texture and little wear.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{distinct}} {{neighborhoods in the}} Point Loma peninsula. Most neighborhoods in Point Loma consist primarily of single family homes. The commercial and retail heart of the peninsula is called Point Loma Village. Its retail establishments serve local residents as well as yachting and sport fishing interests. The streets in Point Loma Village <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> hundreds of jacaranda trees {{as a result of}} community beautification efforts. The newest commercial and retail area is found at Liberty Station, site of the former Naval Training Center San Diego, which also has residential and educational sections. The Midway district at the northern end of the peninsula, adjacent to the San Diego River and the I-5 and I-8 freeways, is primarily commercial and industrial with a few small residential developments.|$|E
5|$|With longitudinal, {{transverse}} and radial muscles, polyps {{are able}} to elongate and shorten, bend and twist, inflate and deflate, and extend and contract their tentacles. Most polyps extend to feed and contract when disturbed, often invaginating their oral discs and tentacles into the column. Contraction is achieved by pumping fluid out of the coelenteron, and reflation by drawing it in, a task performed by the siphonoglyphs in the pharynx which <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> beating cilia. Most anthozoans adhere to the substrate with their pedal discs but some {{are able to}} detach themselves and move about, while others burrow into the sediment. Movement may be a passive drifting with the currents {{or in the case}} of sea anemones, may involve creeping along a surface on their base.|$|E
5|$|Having {{left the}} others, Xavier {{returns to the}} safe room and finds a colored number {{on the back of}} Gus's neck. After realizing the answer to the clue, he kills Jonas with a spiked bat for his number after a brief fight and begins hunting the others. Laura succumbs to the nerve agent after finding the clue {{revealing}} Daniel's identity. Addison and Amanda abandon him, but Amanda returns after finding Jonas' body. Addison finds a glass box housing an antidote, but her arms become trapped in the arm holes which <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> hidden blades, and Xavier leaves her to die after reading her number. Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel in the safe room which leads to a dilapidated bathroom with two rotting corpses. Daniel collapses inside just before Xavier finds them. Amanda notes that he can't read his own number, and he cuts the skin from his neck. As he approaches, Daniel, who feigned his collapse, jumps up and slashes his neck with a hacksaw, killing him.|$|E
