5|$|In many {{versions}} of the tale, the omniscient Rama knows about Sita's impending abduction and creates Maya Sita. Such versions assert Rama's divine status, <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> Valmiki's portrayal of Rama as a human hero.|$|E
5|$|At 6ft 4 in, 225lb (1.93m, 102kg), Ripken was <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the prototypical shortstop of the time—small, fleet-of-foot {{players who}} played a defensively {{difficult}} position but often did not post the home run and batting average totals that an outfielder might. Power hitting shortstops such as Alex Rodriguez, Nomar Garciaparra and Miguel Tejada are often seen by fans {{to be part of}} Ripken's legacy.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} of Graveyard Mountain Home was generally positive. Critics {{noted that the}} album was <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> Moore's previous works, {{and that it was}} best experienced as an alternate soundtrack to Age 13. Moore played songs from Graveyard Mountain Home live {{for the first time in}} a small club in Istanbul in 2007, and planned to tour more extensively in the future.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{was hired}} by Joseph L. Mankiewicz {{to play the role}} of The American (Alden Pyle in the book) in the 1958 version of The Quiet American, {{replacing}} Montgomery Clift when the latter dropped out. Michael Redgrave replaced Laurence Olivier who dropped out when Clift withdrew. The cold-war drama filmed in Vietnam was <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the genre in which Murphy had normally been cast.|$|E

5|$|The high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes were {{designated}} in 1998. When they opened, {{they were the}} first anywhere in a rural area of Colorado. In <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the usual practice, the diamonds were painted in the right lanes rather than the left, so that Roaring Fork Transportation Authority (RFTA) buses could get to and from their stops more easily.|$|E
5|$|The track {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Although many {{thought it was}} catchy, it {{was thought to be}} generic when compared to other songs played on the radio, and is noted for being <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> Cheryl's previous works.|$|E

5|$|When {{originally}} made, Psycho {{was seen}} as <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> Hitchcock's previous film North by Northwest, having been filmed on a low budget, with a television crew and in black and white.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> her {{previous}} work, Ray of Light is an electronica, dance and techno-pop album which incorporates multiple genres, including ambient, trip hop and house music. Vocally, the album saw Madonna sing with greater breadth and a fuller tone. Mystical themes are also strongly present {{in both the}} music and lyrics, {{as a result of}} Madonna embracing Kabbalah, her study of Hinduism and Buddhism, as well as her daily practice of Hatha Yoga.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> {{the hip-hop}} and R {{sound of her}} {{previous}} studio albums, the track is a country and pop ballad revolving around body image and female empowerment. Media outlets had varying opinions of the song's genre, describing it as having soul, blues, gospel, and show tune influences. In the lyrics, Fantasia narrates a tragic story about a woman, while providing commentary on social class, marriage, and alcoholism. Inspired by her past, she recorded the single {{as a way to}} empower women and reconcile with her childhood insecurities.|$|E
5|$|At first, most of {{the newly}} settled Normans kept {{household}} knights and did not settle their retainers with fiefs of their own, but gradually these household knights came to be granted lands of their own, {{a process known as}} subinfeudation. William also required his newly created magnates to contribute fixed quotas of knights towards not only military campaigns but also castle garrisons. This method of organising the military forces was <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the pre-Conquest English practice of basing military service on territorial units such as the hide.|$|E

5|$|Black Cherry is {{the second}} studio album by English {{electronic}} music duo Goldfrapp, released on 23 April 2003 by Mute Records.

The album was met with positive reviews, with many critics complimenting its blend of retro and modern electropop music.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{stint as}} Minister of Commerce {{significantly}} raised his international profile and generated media attention both in China and abroad. Described as good-looking, articulate and open-minded in {{his approach to}} problems, Bo's rise from a municipal official to the central government generated great media fanfare and elevated his status to something of a 'political star.' Bo's political persona was considered <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the generally serious and conservative leadership in Beijing. With his youthful vigour, populism, and purported popularity with female reporters, Bo's political rise had been {{compared to that of}} John F. Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's {{religious}} {{policy was}} <b>a</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> {{that of his}} predecessors. According to Cassius Dio, living emperors could be worshipped as divine {{in the east and}} dead emperors could be worshipped as divine in Rome. Augustus had the public worship his spirit on occasion, but Dio describes this as an extreme act that emperors generally shied away from. Caligula took things a step further and had those in Rome, including senators, worship him as a tangible, living god.|$|E
