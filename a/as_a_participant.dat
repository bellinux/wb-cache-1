40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a Q methodological study of {{stakeholder}} perceptions of rural local government management of natural resources. Data analysis of the Q sorts revealed that there are five distinct stakeholder perspectives relating to rural local government and natural resource management. In terms of natural resource management {{at the local level}} rural stakeholders perceive local government <b>as</b> <b>an</b> unwilling <b>participant,</b> <b>an</b> inconsequential <b>participant,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> problematic <b>participant,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> potential <b>participant,</b> and, most positively, a participatory partner. The paper describes each of these five stakeholder perspectives in detail before examining the implications of these findings for greater natural resource management at the local level in non-metropolitan Australia...|$|R

5|$|Private theatricals were an {{essential}} part of Austen's education. From her early childhood, the family and friends staged a series of plays in the rectory barn, including Richard Sheridan's The Rivals (1775) and David Garrick's Bon Ton. Austen's eldest brother James wrote the prologues and epilogues and she probably joined in these activities, first as a spectator and later <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>participant.</b> Most of the plays were comedies, which suggests how Austen's satirical gifts were cultivated. At the age of 12, she tried her own hand at dramatic writing; she wrote three short plays during her teenage years.|$|E

5|$|Edmund Beaufort, 4th Duke of Somerset, was a {{prominent}} Lancastrian and one of Margaret's trusted men. Interactions between Somerset and Warwick were less than cordial; the Nevilles and Beauforts had been feuding over estates since the early 1450s. Adding to their animosity was the death of Somerset's father, the 2nd Duke, at the First Battle of St Albans. The Yorkists won the engagement after Warwick slipped his force past the Lancastrian defence and attacked from behind. The Beauforts largely blamed the Earl for the Duke's death. Somerset is listed in early chronicles <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>participant</b> in the Battle of Barnet; however, this has been disputed. When the Lancastrians retook England, Warwick ordered the duke to watch over Henry VI in London. Several historians, such as Ross and Anthony Goodman, agree that Somerset left London to welcome Margaret in the south. Michael Jones {{points out that the}} Duke is recorded as having been in Salisbury {{on the day of the}} battle, trying to recruit townsmen for the Lancastrian cause. Trevor Royle suggests that due to Somerset's distrust of Warwick, the Duke would rather await his queen and her army than voluntarily aid the Earl. Therefore, it is unlikely that he fought at Barnet.|$|E
5|$|On January 5, 2017, Dragon Lee made a {{surprise}} return to NJPW, attacking Hiromu Takahashi (the former Kamaitachi) and Tetsuya Naito during their match against Kushida and Michael Elgin.
