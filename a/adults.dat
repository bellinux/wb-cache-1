5|$|Adult {{specimens}} of Limusaurus show morphological traits associated with herbivory that are shared {{with other groups}} of herbivorous theropods, including the Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, Oviraptorosauria, and Alvarezsauroidea, along with the troodontid Jinfengopteryx. In particular, adult specimens are characterized {{by the presence of}} stomach stones (gastroliths), with older <b>adults</b> having gastroliths that are larger and more numerous than those of younger adults; the size and quantity of these gastroliths are comparable to those of birds in young <b>adults,</b> and those of ornithomimosaurs and oviraptorosaurs in old <b>adults.</b> These groups of theropods all used gastroliths in processing plant matter, suggesting that Limusaurus did the same; the increased amount of gastroliths in older <b>adults</b> may be indicative of the gut's ability to finely process plant matter increasing with age. An isotope analysis of the available {{specimens of}} Limusaurus specimens likewise showed that <b>adults</b> consistently match the isotope signatures of other herbivorous dinosaurs; however, in the same analysis, juveniles and subadults were found to vary greatly in their isotopic signatures. This indicates that juveniles were likely omnivorous, but switched to strict herbivory as they aged. This is comparable to the diet shift experienced by the aforementioned mullets and armored catfish.|$|E

5|$|Cockroaches have {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, {{meaning that}} the nymphs are generally similar to the <b>adults,</b> except for undeveloped wings and genitalia.

Young and adult Corythosaurus are similar to Lambeosaurus and Hypacrosaurus but dissimilar to Parasaurolophus in that the sutures of the skull are sinuous, and not smooth and straight. This feature helps differentiate parasaurolophins from lambeosaurins. Generally, the crests of juveniles of lambeosaurines like Corythosaurus, Lambeosaurus, Hypacrosaurus stebingeri, parasaurolophines like Parasaurolophus, and primitive lambeosaurines like Kazaklambia are quite alike, although other features can be used to distinguish them.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to find out why <b>adult</b> {{learners}} absent themselves from <b>adult</b> basic education programmes and to devise strategies to encourage them to attend classes. In order to achieve the aim of the study, the objective of the study were to investigate the economic and social reasons why <b>adult</b> learners do not attend classes. The research focus on a critical issue of absenteei(sm by <b>adult</b> learners at SEKGOSESE West Circuit <b>adult</b> centre in Limpopo Province. Literature review was engaged in the field of <b>Adult</b> Education and related to the research problem. The literature review presented an insight into theoretical frameworks and conceptual frameworks about causes of <b>adult</b> learner’s absenteeism. The researcher used sources which included journals, books, articles and dissertations. To collect information. This qualitative study explored the causes of <b>adult</b> learner absenteeism and came with strategies to reduce <b>adult</b> learner absenteeism. Critical theory was used as a theoretical framework. The theory deals with social economic factors and conditions under which people live. Data was collected through focus group interviews. There were sixteen participants who attend classes at Mosima <b>adult</b> learning centre, and they were selected homogeneously. It was discovered that <b>adult</b> learner absenteeism is caused by lack of motivation, lack of support from departmental officials, lack of <b>adult</b> learner commitment, lack of facilities, lack of qualified <b>adult</b> educators, lack of respect amongst <b>adult</b> learners and <b>adult</b> educators as a serious matter, lack of parental support for those who are still under parental care and lack of transport for <b>adult</b> learners who stay far from the centre. Based on the causes of <b>adult</b> learner absenteeism, recommendations are made for the Department of Education to address these causes in order to elevate <b>adult</b> learner absenteeism and further research efforts are recommended. It is recommended that the department of education include stationery material in their budget for <b>adult</b> basic education. <b>Adult</b> Basic education educators should also receive adequate training s o that they can be able to teach <b>adult</b> learners effectively.
