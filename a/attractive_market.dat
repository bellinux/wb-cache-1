500|$|Gold {{intended}} Galaxy {{to publish}} stories of sufficient literary quality to attract {{readers of the}} slick magazines, {{as well as those}} who came to Galaxy already familiar with genre science fiction. [...] His editorial policy was broader than that of John W. Campbell, the editor of the leading magazine in the field, Astounding Science Fiction: Gold was interested in sociology, psychology, and other [...] "soft" [...] sciences, and was also willing to publish humorous and satirical stories. [...] Gold managed to persuade the publisher to let him offer three to four cents a word, which exceeded the highest rates paid in the field at that time. [...] In addition to the high rates, Galaxy was an <b>attractive</b> <b>market</b> for writers because Gold bought only first magazine rights, unlike the other leading magazines. Galaxy was quickly established as one of the three leading science fiction magazines, along with Campbell's Astounding and The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction (usually abbreviated to F). [...] Campbell had been enormously influential over the previous decade, but the appearance of Galaxy and F, launched just a year before, marked the end of his dominance of the genre.|$|E
