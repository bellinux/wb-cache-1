30|$|Our {{approach}} {{resembles the}} long-lasting debate about resource conflicts and a resource curse, i.e. the institutional inability to transform natural endowments into economic development. However, our paper also contrasts with some recent outlooks about a potentially bright future {{of these states}} [9, 10]. The fine line between being optimistic and pessimistic {{for the future of}} these countries seems to lie in their <b>adaptive</b> <b>capacities,</b> i.e. their ability to become resilient to environmental stress and to manage potential socio-economic stress drivers. To make this more explicit and useful for futures research, our paper develops a heuristic model of such drivers and how they might overshoot the <b>adaptive</b> <b>capacities</b> of resource-rich societies.|$|R

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} consensus that individual <b>adaptive</b> <b>capacities</b> are critical to successfully adapt to climate change and achieve sustainable development. However, {{little is known about}} adaptive practices, particularly in developed countries. Against this background, this paper investigates the strategies used by Swedish citizens to adapt to (changing) climatic variability and extremes. It offers critical insights into the positive and negative effects of such strategies, and discusses their relevance in the formulation of development policies and programmes. The paper highlights how connections between climate and institutional development efforts affect individuals and their activities. The paper concludes that individual <b>adaptive</b> <b>capacities</b> do not necessarily translate into adaptation and that, consequently, planned interventions are required. The importance of more people-oriented adaptation planning, that fosters the sustainable transformation of cities is emphasized, together with the role that South-North knowledge transfer can play in this context...|$|R

The study identified, examined, and mapped 10 slope failure locations, and the vulnerability characteristics of urban dwellers staying in areas that are prone to and threatened by slope failures were described. The identified vulnerability indicators are related to factors such as (1) socio-economic status, (2) population,(3) external characteristics, (4) physical structure of dwellings, and (5) adaptation measures. Finally, the perceptions of the residents who are at risk of slope failure hazards and their inherent coping mechanisms were analyzed.

The vegetation coverage {{and changes in the}} region will directly affect many important economic regions in China. In this paper, based on the long time series NOAA/AVHRR NDVI dataset and vegetation-climate regions map in Inner Mongolia, we utilized the Mann - Kendall non-parametric test to analyze vegetation change treads in different vegetation-climatic regions from 1982 to 2006. The results showed that different vegetation-climate regions had different vegetation change treads. Therein, Central and Western parts of Inner Mongolia had an ascending trend, while, the eastern part had a descending trend. Inner Mongolia span different climatic regions, and plants lived there had various <b>adaptive</b> <b>capacities</b> under different environments.

2500|$|Most {{countries}} are Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

[...] The natural, technical, and social sciences can provide information on decisions relating to this objective, e.g., the possible magnitude and rate of future climate changes. However, the IPCC has also concluded that the decision of what constitutes [...] "dangerous" [...] interference requires value judgements, which will vary between {{different regions of the}} world. Factors that might affect this decision include the local consequences of climate change impacts, the ability of a particular region to adapt to climate change (<b>adaptive</b> <b>capacity),</b> and the ability of a region to reduce its GHG emissions (mitigative capacity).|$|E

40|$|The Lake Victoria basin (LVB) in East Africa can be {{considered}} a climate change hotspot because of its large rural population dependent on rain-fed farming. Drawing on extensive fieldwork (2007 - 2011) in rural communities along the shores of Lake Victoria in Kenya and Tanzania, I explore <b>adaptive</b> <b>capacities</b> to climate variability and change and discuss how they interrelate in situ. Using multiple methods, tools and techniques, including survey and rainfall data, individual and group interviews, interactive mapping of seasonal calendars and a multi-stakeholder workshop, I locate the place-based effects and responses to a number of converging climate induced stressors on smallholder farmers’ wellbeing and natural resources. Research findings show that <b>adaptive</b> <b>capacities</b> to climate variability and change in the LVB are complex, dynamic and characterized by high location-specificity, thereby signifying the value of using an integrative and place-based approach to understand climate vulnerability. Specifically, the study demonstrates how increased unpredictability in rainfall causes chronic livelihood stress illustrated by recurring and worsening periods of food insecurity, growing cash dependency and heavy disease burdens. The study also reveals that food and income buffers increase when and where farmers, particularly women farmers, collectively respond to climate induced stressors through deliberate strategies rooted in a culture of saving and planning. Nevertheless, the study concludes that smallholders in the LVB are facing a highly uncertain future with discernible, yet differentiated adaptation deficits, due to chronic livelihood stress driven by unequal access to fundamental <b>adaptive</b> <b>capacities</b> such as land, health, cash and collective networks...|$|R
5|$|How life {{originated}} from inorganic matter remains an unresolved problem in biology. One prominent {{hypothesis is that}} life {{first appeared in the}} form of short self-replicating RNA polymers. On this view, life may have come into existence when RNA chains first experienced the basic conditions, as conceived by Charles Darwin, for natural selection to operate.

The three primary <b>adaptive</b> <b>capacities</b> could logically have been: (1) the capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type), (2) the capacity to avoid decay, and (3) the capacity to acquire and process resources.
