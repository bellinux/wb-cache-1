5|$|June 3, 1825– Around 50vessels <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> ashore from an early-season hurricane; {{the storm}} causes severe damage to coastal {{plantations}} {{from a high}} storm tide.|$|E
5|$|Phreatomagmatic eruptions are eruptions {{that arise}} from {{interactions}} between water and magma. They <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> from thermal contraction (as opposed to magmatic eruptions, which <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> by thermal expansion) of magma when it comes in contact with water. This temperature {{difference between the two}} causes violent water-lava interactions that make up the eruption. The products of phreatomagmatic eruptions are believed to be more regular in shape and finer grained than the products of magmatic eruptions because of the differences in eruptive mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Car #23D <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> by {{international}} sports car and Formula One racer Paul Hawkins and Bill Brown, #24D <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> by New Zealander Jim Palmer (a Tasman Series regular) and Phil West, while car #25D <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> by 1964 Armstrong 500 winner George Reynolds and veteran touring and sports car driver Brian Muir.|$|R
5000|$|The engine has a {{single-stage}} fan with 29 titanium blades and a Kevlar outer shell, which <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by a three-stage turbine. The six-stage {{low pressure compressor}} with titanium blades <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by a single-stage non-cooled low pressure turbine. The seven-stage high-pressure compressor with steel blades <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by a steel bladed high-pressure turbine.|$|R
50|$|Four {{cars were}} entered for the 24 Heures du Mans of June 23 and 24 1962. Chassis 103 {{received}} number 53 and <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> {{by the team}} of André Guilhaudin and André Bertaut. Chassis 104 received number 54 and <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> by Pierre Lelong and Jean-Pierre Hanrioud. Chassis 105 received number 55 and <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> by Bernard Boyer and Guy Verrier. A car that {{is believed to have}} been chassis 102 received number 70 and was to have <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> by Robert Neyret and Robert Mougin but the car did not arrive.|$|R
5|$|Elaborate sexual {{displays}} and posturing are {{encountered in the}} behavioural ecology of animals. The birds-of-paradise, for example, sing and display elaborate ornaments during courtship. These displays serve a dual purpose of signalling healthy or well-adapted individuals and desirable genes. The displays <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> by sexual selection as an advertisement of quality of traits among suitors.|$|E
5|$|Flagella are rigid protein structures, about 20nanometres in {{diameter}} and up to 20micrometres in length, that are used for motility. Flagella <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> by the energy released by the transfer of ions down an electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|June 6–7, 1832 – The {{center of}} a {{tropical}} cyclone passes over or {{very close to the}} islands. Two schooners in St. George's Harbour <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> aground, and several houses are partially or totally unroofed. Tree damage is extensive.|$|E
5000|$|Bulldozer has {{appeared}} in four Monster Jam World Finals. In 2001, the truck <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> by Eldon DePew. In 2000, 2002, and 2004, the truck <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> by Guy Wood.|$|R
50|$|The Prime Minister of Macedonia <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> in {{an armored}} Mercedes-Benz S600 Guard and escorted by four VW Passat B8. The President of Macedonia <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by {{stretched}} Mercedes-Benz W140.|$|R
50|$|Section B {{includes}} up {{to eight}} obstacles, to <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> in sequence. The last designated 300 to 500 m must <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> at walk or trot, with no stopping for any reason.|$|R
5|$|Other {{studies by}} Rasmussen and her {{international}} colleagues {{looked at the}} importance of energy availability, and a 2007 paper showed that global patterns of spatial turnover <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> principally by widespread species rather than restricted ones. This complements other work, and helps to establish a unified model of how terrestrial biodiversity varies both within and between the Earth's major land masses.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} excess thyroid hormone {{typically}} {{respond to the}} administration of a non-selective beta blocker, such as propranolol (as most of the symptoms <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> by increased levels of adrenaline {{and its effect on}} the β-adrenergic receptors). Subsequent attacks may be prevented by avoiding known precipitants, such as high salt or carbohydrate intake, until the thyroid disease has been adequately treated.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years prior}} to the start of the game's main story, Saturos and Menardi raid Mt. Aleph with the intent to steal the Elemental Stars, but fail to solve the riddles {{guarding}} them and <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> away by the mountain's trap, a magically generated thunderstorm and rock slide.|$|E
40|$|A flow {{model of}} labor market {{participation}} {{is used to}} describe how various exogenous variations jointly affect unemployment and participation and provides short-run identification restrictions of a structural VAR. In some countries, fast rising female participation {{may have had a}} moderate short- and medium-run impact on unemployment rates. A variance decomposition exercise indicates that, in Continental Europe, participation <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> in the short run by unemployment shocks, whereas in the USA, it <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by participation shocks (demography, immigration). Unemployment in Europe <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by participation shocks, whereas in the USA, it <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by unemployment shocks...|$|R
2500|$|Before {{the last}} spike <b>was</b> <b>driven,</b> three other {{commemorative}} spikes, presented {{on behalf of}} the other three members of the Central Pacific's Big Four who did not attend the ceremony, had <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> in the pre-bored laurel tie: ...|$|R
50|$|H. Julius Smith also {{invented the}} first {{satisfactory}} portable power supply for igniting blasting caps: a high-voltage magneto that <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> by a rack and pinion, {{which in turn}} <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> by a T-handle that was pushed downwards.|$|R
5|$|While the comet's dust tail roughly {{followed}} {{the path of}} the comet's orbit and the gas tail pointed almost directly away from the Sun, the sodium tail appeared to lie between the two. This implies that the sodium atoms <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> away from the comet's head by radiation pressure.|$|E
5|$|Already in his 70s, Sun falls ill and the {{restaurant}} is taken over by Hendra, who decides it will serve exclusively pork, alienating Muslim customers. Hendra comes into conflict with Soleh over Menuk, as Hendra had previously dated her. Menuk becomes increasingly depressed after Soleh tells her {{that he plans to}} divorce her, and they <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> apart. Rika feels stressed as a result of how she has been treated by her neighbours and family after converting to Catholicism from Islam; Abi is also facing ostracism. Meanwhile, Surya and Doni (Glenn Fredly) are competing for Rika's affections. Surya is upset over his failure to find a good acting job.|$|E
5|$|Archaea flagella operate like {{bacterial}} flagella—their long stalks <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> by rotatory motors at the base. These motors are {{powered by}} the proton gradient across the membrane. However, archaeal flagella are notably different in composition and development. The two types of flagella evolved from different ancestors. The bacterial flagellum shares a common ancestor with the type III secretion system, while archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from bacterial type IV pili. In contrast to the bacterial flagellum, which is hollow and is assembled by subunits moving up the central pore {{to the tip of}} the flagella, archaeal flagella are synthesized by adding subunits at the base.|$|E
5000|$|Deeley {{valve gear}} - fitted to several express {{locomotives}} on the Midland Railway. The combination levers <b>were</b> <b>driven,</b> as normal, from the crossheads. Each expansion link <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> from the crosshead {{on the opposite}} side of the engine.|$|R

50|$|The DATA line <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> on the {{positive}} edge and read on the negative edge of the CLK line. The DATA line can <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> high, driven low, or held at the high or low level by an internal bus-holder circuit, depending upon the particular operational mode of a SLIMbus Device.|$|R
5|$|In Baby Face Stanwyck {{moves to}} New York and sleeps {{her way to}} the top of Gotham Trust. Her {{progress}} is illustrated in a recurring visual metaphor of the movie camera panning ever upward along the front of Gotham Trust's skyscraper. Men <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> mad with lust over her and they commit murder, attempt suicide, and are ruined financially for associating with her before she mends her ways in the final reel. In another departure from post Code films, Stanwyck's sole companion for the duration of the picture is a black woman named Chico (Theresa Harris), whom she took with her when she ran away from home at age 14.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{atmosphere}} {{has multiple}} jet streams, {{caused by the}} convection cells that form the familiar banded color structure; on Jupiter, these convection cells <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> by internal heating. The factors that control the number of jet streams in a planetary atmosphere is an active area of research in dynamical meteorology. In models, as one increases the planetary radius, holding all other parameters fixed, the number of jet streams decreases.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{systems are}} {{areas of the}} brain that are {{involved}} in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.|$|E
50|$|Outbound leisure {{passenger}} traffic <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by high average disposable income in Edmonton. Inbound leisure {{passenger traffic}} <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by major tourist destinations in Edmonton such as West Edmonton Mall, the Edmonton Fringe Festival and nearby Jasper National Park.|$|R
50|$|An axle that <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by {{the engine}} or prime mover <b>is</b> called a <b>drive</b> axle.|$|R
50|$|Example: The last license-plate digit of {{a vehicle}} from Illinois is 3. From Monday to Friday, it may not <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> between 5 <b>a.m.</b> and 11 a.m. On Wednesday, it may not <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> between 5 <b>a.m.</b> and 10 p.m.|$|R
5|$|Nielsen {{views the}} brachiopods and closely related phoronids as {{affiliated}} with the deuterostome pterobranchs because their lophophores <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> by one cilium per cell, while those of bryozoans, which he regards as protosomes, have multiple cilia per cell. However, pterobranchs are hemichordates and probably closely related to echinoderms, {{and there is no}} evidence that the latest common ancestor of pterobranchs and other hemichordates or the latest common ancestor of hemichordates and echinoderms was sessile and fed by means of tentacles.|$|E
5|$|Submarine {{volcanism}} {{is driven}} by various processes. Volcanoes near plate boundaries and mid-ocean ridges are built by the decompression melting of mantle rock that rises on an upwelling portion of a convection cell to the crustal surface. Eruptions associated with subducting zones, meanwhile, <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> by subducting plates that add volatiles to the rising plate, lowering its melting point. Each process generates different rock; mid-ocean ridge volcanics are primarily basaltic, whereas subduction flows are mostly calc-alkaline, and more explosive and viscous.|$|E
5|$|The {{action in}} the book moves from Newby's life in the fashion {{business}} in London to Afghanistan. On the way Newby describes his very brief training in mountaineering in North Wales, a stop in Istanbul, and a nearly-disastrous drive across Turkey and Persia. They <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> out to the Panjshir Valley, where they begin their walk, with many small hardships described in a humorous narrative, supported by genuine history of Nuristan and brief descriptions of the rare moments of beauty along the way. Disagreements with Newby's Persian-speaking companion Hugh Carless, and odd phrases in an antique grammar book, are exploited to comic effect.|$|E
50|$|The SA05 <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> by Takuma Sato, whose firing by {{the works}} Honda team {{had played a}} {{significant}} role in creating the team, and also <b>was</b> <b>driven</b> by inexperienced Japanese rookie Yuji Ide and long-term Renault test driver Franck Montagny.|$|R
50|$|Knight and {{his family}} <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> from Jackson County in the Mormon persecutions of 1832-33 and {{eventually}} settled in Caldwell County, Missouri. They <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> from Missouri entirely {{in the winter of}} 1838-39 and settled shortly thereafter at Nauvoo, Illinois.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is a type}} of step-growth, {{condensation}} polymerization whereas the other metathesis polymerization reaction, ring-opening metathesis polymerization is a chain-growth, addition polymerization.
