5|$|Studio Ghibli {{released}} {{an adaptation of}} the series in 2006 titled Tales from Earthsea. The film very loosely combines elements of the first, third, and fourth books into a new story. Le Guin commented with displeasure on the film-making process, saying that she had acquiesced to the adaptation believing Hayao Miyazaki would be producing the film himself, which was eventually not the case. Le Guin praised the imagery of the film, but disliked the use of violence. She also expressed dissatisfaction with the portrayal of morality, {{and in particular the}} use of a villain who could be slain as a means of resolving conflict, which she said was <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> message of the book. The film received generally mixed responses.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of an}} heir {{who could}} feasibly provide a new {{direction}} for the nation also diminished the long-term prospects of the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor loved his daughter Isabel, but he considered {{the idea of a}} female successor as <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> role required of Brazil's ruler. He viewed the death of his two sons as being a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted. Resistance to accepting a female ruler was also shared by the political establishment. Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was still very traditional, and only a male successor was thought capable as head of state.|$|E

His behavior is consistent with a pattern of unprofessional, disrespectful behavior directed by Mr. Pelini toward the passionate fans of Nebraska, employees of the university and, most concerning, our student-athletes.

Tacitus also uses collections of letters (epistolarium). He also took information from exitus illustrium virorum. These were a collection of books by those who were <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> emperors. They tell of sacrifices by martyrs to freedom, especially the men who committed suicide. While he places no value on the Stoic theory of suicide and views suicides as ostentatious and politically useless, Tacitus often gives prominence to speeches made by those about to commit suicide, for example Cremutius Cordus' speech in Ann.

25|$|Maimonides and Nachmanides {{differed}} {{about the}} reason for the sacrificial system. Maimonides wrote that {{the reason for}} the offerings was because when the Israelites lived in Egypt and Chaldea, the Egyptians worshipped sheep and the Chaldeans worshipped demons in the form of goats. And people in India never slaughter cattle. Thus God commanded the Israelites to slaughter cattle, sheep, and goats to God, so that worshipers of the other lands would know that God required the very act that they considered to be the utmost sin, and through that act God would forgive Israel's sins. God thus intended to cure the people of the other nations of false beliefs, which Maimonides characterized as diseases of the soul, for diseases are healed by medicines that are <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> diseases.|$|E
25|$|U.S. analyst Ashley J. Tellis {{argues that}} the Indo-US nuclear deal is {{attractive}} to India because it gives it access to far more options on its civil nuclear programme than would otherwise be the case, primarily by ending its isolation from the international nuclear community. These options include access to latest technologies, access to higher unit output reactors which are more economical, access to global finance for building reactors, ability to export its indigenous small reactor size PHWRs, better information flow for its research community, etc. Finally, the deal also gives India two options that are relatively independent from the three-stage programme, {{at least in terms}} of their dependencies on success or failure. The first option is that, India can opt to stay with the first stage reactors as long as the global supply of uranium lasts. The plus side of this is that it covers any risk from short term delays or failures in implementing the three-stage programme. On the negative side, this is an option that is <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> underlying objective of energy independence through the exploitation of thorium.|$|E

40|$|Peace {{activists and}} negotiators face a {{particularly}} daunting task {{in areas where}} violence functions {{as a tool for}} reinforcing ethno-national boundaries and maintaining group cohesion. In such an environment, support and justiﬁcation for violence exist as a distinct reality, separate from political practice. Promoters of peace and conciliation therefore face the tremendous challenge of tackling this ‘‘culture of violence’’, trying to integrate it and, eventually, transform it into a viable ‘‘culture of peace’’. More ambitiously, as militarism and violence remain intrinsically <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> culture, <b>the</b> broader goal should be to devise some sort of ‘‘alchemy’’ capable of transforming violence into culture.

40|$|The paper {{starts with}} the largely {{accepted}} definition of culture as set of experiences or life practices and values.

The paper is framed in the Viable System Approach (VSA). According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> VSA, information variety is articulated in three dimensions: informative units, interpretative schemes, and values. The last one is just the cultural dimension and its nature (rich or poor in variety) deeply influences the cognitive capability of a system (individual or organization) in promoting, accepting, or refusing the change. The VSA proposal linking information variety to values is new and {{it could lead to}} original insight in understanding the role of cultural values in promoting (or impeding) innovation in complex environment...|$|R
40|$|Through {{engagement}} {{with a range}} of recent publications, this article offers a mini-ethnography of wonder discourses in the anthropology of ontology, leading to a rethink of the concept of religion.

With this criterion of difference in view, this article identifies certain trends in the anthropology of ontology that appear to enjoin and pursue open-ended wonder in ways that might be read as constituting anthropology as religious science.

Writing in the introduction to a recent edition of Michel Ciment's Kubrick, film director Martin Scorsese notes that most of Kubrick's films were misunderstood when first released, and came to be regarded as masterpieces only in the years after their releases.

500|$|John Bishop {{has been}} the most vocal {{supporter}} of treating Finnegans Wake absolutely, in every sense, as a description of a dream, the dreamer, and of the night itself; arguing that the book not only represents a dream in an abstract conception, but is fully a literary representation of sleep. On the subject Bishop writes: [...] The greatest obstacle to our comprehension of Finnegans Wake [...] the failure on the part of readers to believe that Joyce really meant what he said when he spoke of the book as a [...] "reconstruction of the nocturnal life" [...] and an [...] "imitation of the dream-state"; and as a consequence readers have perhaps too easily exercised on the text an unyielding literalism bent on finding a kind of meaning in every way <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kind of meaning purveyed in dreams [...] Bishop has also somewhat brought back into fashion the theory that the Wake is about a single sleeper; arguing that it is not [...] "the 'universal dream' of some disembodied global everyman, but a reconstruction of the night – and a single night – as experienced by 'one stable somebody' whose 'earwitness' on the real world is coherently chronological." [...] Bishop has laid the path for critics such as Eric Rosenbloom, who has proposed that the book [...] "elaborates the fragmentation and reunification of identity during sleep. The masculine [...] mind of the day has been overtaken by the feminine night mind. [...] The characters live in the transformation and flux of a dream, embodying the sleeper’s mind." ...|$|E
