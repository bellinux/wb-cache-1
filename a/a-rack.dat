40|$|SummaryThe {{transcription}} factor IRF 3 {{is a central}} regulator of type I interferon (IFN) signaling. The mechanisms underlying deactivation of IRF 3 are poorly understood although many studies suggest that IRF 3 activity is terminated through degradation after viral infection. Here we report that IRF 3 is deactivated via dephosphorylation mediated by the serine and threonine phosphatase PP 2 A and its adaptor protein RACK 1. The PP 2 <b>A-RACK</b> 1 complex negatively regulated the IRF 3 pathway after LPS or poly(I:C) stimulation or Sendai virus (SeV) infection. After challenge with LPS, poly(I:C), or low-titer SeV, activated IRF 3 was dephosphorylated and returned to resting state without being degraded, although high-titer SeV infection triggered the degradation of IRF 3. Furthermore, PP 2 A-deficient macrophages showed enhanced type I IFN signaling upon LPS, poly(I:C), and SeV challenge and protected mice from lethal vesicular stomatitis virus infection. Therefore, dephosphorylation of IRF 3 is a deactivation mechanism that contributes to termination of IRF 3 -type I IFN signaling...|$|E
