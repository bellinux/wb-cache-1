2500|$|Unaided plant roots may {{be unable}} to take up {{nutrients}} that are chemically or physically immobilised; examples include phosphate ions and micronutrients such as iron. One form of such immobilization occurs in soil with high clay content, or soils with a strongly basic pH. The mycelium of the mycorrhizal fungus can, however, access many such nutrient sources, and make them available to the plants they colonize. Thus many plants are able to obtain phosphate, without using soil as a source. Another form of immobilisation is when nutrients are locked up in organic matter that is slow to decay, such as wood, and some mycorrhizal fungi act directly as decay organisms, mobilising the nutrients and passing some onto the host plants; for example, in some dystrophic forests, large amounts of phosphate and other nutrients are taken up by mycorrhizal hyphae acting directly on leaf litter, bypassing the need for soil uptake. [...] Inga <b>alley</b> <b>cropping,</b> proposed as an alternative to slash and burn rainforest destruction, relies upon mycorrhiza within the Inga Tree root system to prevent the rain from washing phosphorus out of the soil.|$|E

5000|$|Tagasaste or Tree Lucerne is used {{extensively}} by small scale Dairy farmers in East Africa, {{for its ability}} to enable commercial milk production levels on a small plot of land planted with a living fence of self replacing Tree Lucerne. It is seen as a low cost self grown alternative to Diary meal and Alfalfa pellets. Treelucerne is used as a boundary fence and hedgerow, acting as a windbreak aimed at stopping fire, wind and yielding privacy, fodder as well as firewood. Branches are typically lopped off by hand, and fed to grazing animals that may typically include 1-3 goats (milk and meat), half a dozen chickens (eggs), 1-2 calves (feedlot fattening) and 1-2 Dairy cows, all on one hectare of land. The Tree Lucerne may be used to fence the property and the house, with the cash <b>crop</b> grown between <b>alleys</b> of Tree Lucerne. Tree Lucerne is thus {{used extensively}} for purposes of biological fertilisation and soil improvement utilizing the <b>alley</b> <b>crop</b> method whereby vegetables, as well as cash crops such as tobacco and maize are planted in the interrow from year 3 onwards. As {{one of the fastest growing}} trees in East Africa the need for firewood for own consumption is a major driver for uptake, with the fodder and fence ability of secondary value. This is now changing due to the discovery that Tree Lucerne can fix up to 587 kg of Nitrogen per hectare per year, roughly half below ground by nitrogen fixation and roughly half when the plant is kept in a permanent juvenile state by lopping off <b>alley</b> <b>crop</b> branches at waist level and using it either as livestock feed (with manure then added as fertilizer and a nitrogen pathway) or with the branches put on top of the soil and covered with soil as a [...] "green manure". Over time substantial increases in crop yields have been achieved this way, in the order of raising 1 ton of Maize production to 8-10 tons, and 700 kg of Burley Tobacco to 3-3.5 tons, per hectare, per year. The level of Biological fertilisation achieved by Tree Lucerne is at the top end of that found in the legume family, and typically consist of about 30-50 grams of Nitrogen per meter of row. The use of Tree Lucerne for Terra Preta purposes was pioneered in Central East Africa on Oxisoil.|$|R

The intercropping using Tree Lucerne result in potential production increases to commercial production levels, although the biological fertilisation benefits typically only kicks in from month 24 onwards, with the first substantial commercial crop yield benefit at the end of year 3. Tree Lucerne is a sustainable biological approach to soil fertility, especially if combined with Terra Preta. 40 kg of Nitrogen per hectare per year typically yields 1 ton of Maize, 200 kg of N yields 4 tons and 400 kg of N close to 8 tons, per hectare, per year. The ability of Tree Lucerne to fix 587 kg of free Atmospheric Nitrogen per ha/year is thus very attractive to remote rural farmers locked in a soil poverty cycle.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{nutrient}} balance was determined for sole and <b>alley</b> <b>cropped</b> Sorghum bicolor and Acacia saligna in a runoff irrigation system in Northern Kenya. Nutrient input including precipitation and runoff, and output through harvest and leaching were measured for N, P, K, Ca and Mg using adsorption resins, tensiometry and suction cups. Various management scenarios are discussed {{with respect to}} nutrient return. Nutrient input with rainfall was generally low in comparison to nutrient uptake or leaching losses. The irrigation water, however, constituted an important nutrient input, especially for Ca and Mg. Nutrient export with the harvest was large for N and K, but can effectively be reduced by a nutrient return with mulch. Nutrient leaching losses from the topsoil (0 – 30 cm) were lower in the sorghum monoculture than in the treebased systems. In the subsoil (120 cm), however, leaching was effectively reduced by the trees. In the agroforestry system, leaching losses of N under the sorghum were 53 % lower than in the sorghum monoculture. This {{could be attributed to}} a higher root abundance and a higher ratio of nutrient uptake-to-leaching in the agroforestry system than in the monocultures indicating a higher nutrient efficiency. The lower leaching losses in the agroforestry system compared to the crop monoculture could not compensate for the additional nutrient export in tree biomass.

40|$|Agriculture {{for rural}} {{communities}} in semi-arid areas {{is a risky}} exercise. The adverse weather conditions (high evaporative demand and low rainfall) of these regions, coupled with comparatively limited mechanization and often soil of poor chemical and physical constitution make crop production difficult and seldom sustainable. To some this problem represents a conundrum to be solved, to others an inconvenience to be avoided. Reduction of agricultural risk in these communities can be addressed in numerous ways, but should always begin with a thorough investigation of the agricultural imperatives of the community targeted, with the recommended system then tailored specifically to meet these imperatives. Agroforestry (combining trees and crops in agricultural systems temporally or spatially simultaneously) has been recommended for, and often been very successful in, many rural communities in tropical Africa and Asia. Adoption in semi-arid Africa has been less widespread, and often less successful once implemented. Nevertheless, the risk reduction possibilities that agroforestry offers through crop complementarity and yield diversification warrant further investigation into the practice in these regions. These studies sought to quantify yield advantage or disadvantage of hedgerow intercropping or alleycropping systems (combining hedgerow Leucaena leucocephala with various annual <b>alley</b> <b>crops</b> of importance to rural South African communities) compared to pure stands, and to investigate the use and distribution of, and competition for, water and light in these systems. Although alley-cropped annuals seldom outperformed pure stand annual crops, the diversification of yield, enabled by combining trees and crops, compensated for lower yields of annual crops in dry seasons or when yield losses occurred through disease. Whether or not this compensation for yield loss would be to the ultimate benefit of the target community {{would depend on the}} relative value of the different products resulting from the intercropping system. Using modifications of the renowned Land Equivalent Ratio and energy contents of products of the system, attempts were made to quantify possible benefits of intercropping in terms valid for the community targeted. Studies of water and light distribution in these systems illuminated often-severe water shortages in alley rows close to hedgerows and showed little benefit in altering row orientation for improved light distribution. Water emerged, as expected, as the primary concern to possible adopters of these systems in semi-arid zones. Crop modeling with mechanistic, biophysically sound models should be considered as an extremely important tool in combining needs of communities with environmental constraints of the area targeted.

However, as the microenvironment created by trees could affect plant development, rates of legume growth and {{biological nitrogen fixation}} may prove inadequate. In this study, we analyze the nitrogen benefits of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) grown in rainfed conditions as a sole crop (SC) or in the alleys of a 15 -year old hybrid walnut-based agroforestry system (AF). The fate of N derived from biological fixation by chickpea was assessed with the(15) N natural abundance method {{and the amount of}} N released from roots into the soil by rhizodeposition was quantified for the 0 - 30 cm horizon using the(15) N cotton-wick labeling method. The measurements were made {{in the middle of the}} <b>crop</b> <b>alley,</b> where the total cumulative radiation received by plants was 90 % of full sunlight, so as to focus on N cycling. The total plant N was 33 % higher in AF than in SC whereas plants had similar N concentrations in vegetative above-ground parts and roots in AF and in SC. This difference was due to a very high N concentration in grains and to twice as much seed biomass in AF plants as in SC ones. The percentage of plant N fixed from the atmosphere by chickpea plants grown in AF was half that in SC. The N rhizodeposition was 47. 2 +/- A 10. 2 mg plant(- 1) and 60. 4 +/- A 15. 3 for SC and AF respectively. Considering the chickpea plant density, we estimated the nitrogen soil supply to chickpea at 2. 2 and 28. 2 kg N ha(- 1) for SC and AF respectively. In conclusion, our results showed that environmental conditions in the middle of the AF <b>crop</b> <b>alley</b> were beneficial for chickpea growth, seed biomass and quality of the seed, probably because of the combination of a higher mineral N availability (higher N turnover) due to better conditions for organic nitrogen mineralization, created by the trees.

40|$|Abstract: There is {{need for}} proper {{understanding}} of plant nutrients {{status in the}} soil and their requirements by various crops under different farming system. Farmers must be encouraged to make compost from residues, house refuse and other decomposable wastes available with them. If crop residues have been incorporated into the soil, {{care must be taken}} that it must be incorporated well in advance (about 6 weeks) before planting crops to avoid N-immobilization. There are always advantages of cultivating cereals in rotation with legumes or intercropping with legumes rather than growing monoculture. A leguminous crop which covers the ground is always useful in protecting the soil micro-organisms and improves the water use efficiency. Also, they fix atmospheric – N through symbiosis and improve the soil fertility. Agro forestry also is useful if it is properly managed, frequent pruning is needed in order to avoid competition of <b>alleys</b> with <b>crop</b> plants for nutrients and soil moisture. The use of inorganic fertilizers boosts crop yield but its use has to be done very carefully. Chemical fertilizers can increase yield for short term but may deplete other nutrients from the soil. It is always advantageous if inorganic fertilizers are used along with some organic manure such as farm yard manure, composts etc. Soil fertility can be maintained with organic manures alone if it is available in sufficient quantity. Farmers hardly apply any chemical fertilizers to their crops grown around houses. The simple reason {{is that most of the}} house refuse is thrown out in the nearby field around the house.

40|$|In the Philippines, {{smallholder}} {{farmers have}} become major timber producers and trees planted on farms {{are an important}} source of raw materials and income for them and for the local timber industry. The smallholder mode of timber production has several advantages over traditional reforestation. The frequent and intensive tending operations (land cultivation, weeding and fertilization) for annual intercrops improve tree survival and growth. Intercropping reduces tree establishment and weeding costs because these are charged to annual crop production. The <b>cropped</b> <b>alleys</b> between tree lines function as effective firebreaks. However, the planting of timber trees in association with light-demanding annual crops often leads to a drastic suppression in crop production as a result of competition for both above- and below-ground resources. With few exceptions, the most common timber trees promoted for farm forestry have been reported to decrease yields of associated crops. Therefore, concerns have been raised over the sustainability and suitability of tree farming for resource-poor farmers. Branch pruning effectively reduces light interception by the tree canopy, and thus prolongs the number of years that annual crop production can be practiced. However, to minimize crop yield suppression, farmers often practice intensive pruning annually before planting annual crops. Intensive pruning may enhance crop yield, but it i...|$|R
40|$|In every {{agroforestry}} system, {{the tree}} canopy reduces the incident radiation for the crop. However, cereal varieties were selected, and most crop growth models {{were designed for}} unshaded conditions, so both may be unsuited to agroforestry conditions and performance. In southern France, durum wheat productivity was monitored over 2 years in an agroforestry system including walnut trees and under artificial shade conditions. Yield components were measured in both full and reduced light conditions. The cereal yield was always decreased by shade; by almost 50 % for the heaviest shade conditions (31 % of light reduction). The main effect of the shade was {{the reduction in the}} number of grains per spike (35 % at the most) and in the weight of grains (16 % at the most). The mean grain weight was moderately affected, while the protein content was increased in shaded con- ditions (by up to 38 % for artificial shade). Consequently, the protein yield per hectare was less reduced by the shade than the dry matter grain yield. A crop model (STICS) was also used to simulate the crop productivity in full light and shaded conditions, but the crop LAI and the yield components were not correctly simulated in the shade. The simulations emphasized the sensitivity of the wheat grain filling to shade during the critical period, 30 days before flowering, for yield elaboration.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of land users at the Central Plateau of Burkina Faso make a living by farming small plots, where mainly staple crops are produced for subsistence use. Both area interventions and line interventions comprising indigenous techniques as well as introduced techniques can be encountered at the Central Plateau and {{have proved to be}} effective. There is a preference for semi-permeable line measures that slow down runoff and prevent water logging in wet periods. In order to ascertain the rationale behind the choice of soil and water conservation measures and the implementation strategy, five large soil and water conservation projects in three Sahelian countries have been investigated. The choice of technology and the way of implementation differed greatly between projects. This was attributable more to the preference of donors and projects than to any physical, socio-economic and agronomic differences. On the basis of project performances, a recommendable strategy for farmers' fields appeared to be the use of the local zay technique to achieve a short-term improvement, and to combine this with stone lines or vegetation barriers for a long-term effect. Low adoption rate of soil and water conservation (SWC) measures in erosion-prone areas is often ascribed to the high investment costs of measures. The costs of these measures may seem modest in comparison to costs for infrastructure, but they are often too high for the individual subsistence farmer, especially in marginal semi-arid zones in the Sahel. Investment costs are highest for stone rows, whereby the transport of stones requires substantial inputs of labour and means of transport. Vegetation barriers are less costly, but have the disadvantage {{that they need to be}} planted in the rainy season, when agricultural production activities have the highest priority. A major reason why farmers consider the costs prohibitive relates to the uncertain nature of the benefits. These benefits comprise of several elements, some of which may have immediate effect (e. g. moisture retention), but most of which occur only gradually over a long period of time, and are hard to assess and even harder to quantify. In a qualitative multi-criteria analysis stone rows showed the best results, and this was also the measure that with the help of development projects, has been most often applied at the Central Plateau in Burkina Faso. However, vegetation barriers, which have not yet been greatly promoted come a close second and are the best solution in areas where stones are scarce or not available. This conclusion was the starting point of the water conservation research by means of vegetation barriers. The on station field experiment was set up to evaluate the effectiveness of vegetation barriers for soil and water conservation under semi-arid conditions at the research station of the Institute de Développement Rural (IDR) at Gampela. Seven local plant species (grasses: Andropogon gayanus, Vetiveria zizanioides; woody species: Acacia nilotica, Guiera sengalensis,Piliostigma reticulatum, Ziziphus mauritiana; and a succulent: Agave sisalana) were planted on a 2 % slope of a sandy loam (Chromic Luvisol), in 21 plots of 20 x 20 m as conservation barriers, along the contour. To determine the runoff interception efficiency of barriers and to find out the influence of slope length and alley treatment, runoff induced by a large number of storms was measured on plots with slope lengths of 1. 25 m (1 m 2), 6. 25 m (5 m 2), and 12. 5 m (10 m 2). Plots without a barrier (no barrier) were used as the control. Grass barriers and stone rows proved to be very effective (effective barrier) in impeding runoff and reducing runoff to only 20 % of precipitation. The runoff through woody species and succulents (less effective barrier) was about 50 % of precipitation. By comparison with the control, a barrier always resulted in water conservation. Less effective barriers with a bare or <b>cropped</b> <b>alley</b> showed a decrease in runoff percentage with an increase of plot length along the slope, whereas effective barriers with a bare or <b>cropped</b> <b>alley</b> showed an increase of runoff along the slope. The effect of crop development on runoff was rather small. Runoff reduction during the growing season was highest on plots without a barrier and on plots with the less effective barriers. On short (1. 25 m) and long (12. 5 m) slopes the influence of rain intensity on runoff production was marginal. On the medium slope length (6. 25 m), rain intensity influenced runoff most on plots with a less effective barrier. A general conclusion was that for longer slopes, all factors such as type of barrier, land use and rain intensity became less important. In that situation, large runoff volumes exceeded the quantity of water that can be dammed by the vegetation barriers, and can be intercepted as a result of land use activities and vegetation on the alley. It is concluded that barriers improve water conservation and are most effective when closely spaced. Large differences in sediment transport in the amount of sediment yield were found between the barrier types. Grasses and natural vegetation proved to be very effective in catching soil particles and diminishing sediment transport. The dense effective barriers slow down flow velocity, build up backwater and promote sedimentation upstream. The through flow in the less effective barriers with woody species and succulents was slightly hampered and flow velocity was not reduced enough, resulting in a higher sediment transport. Under degraded conditions soil loss diminished 50 % with less effective and 70 - 90 % with effective barriers. During the initial cropping phase (light tillage) sediment transport was reduced 40 - 60 % with effective barriers and showed an increase with less effective barriers. In the full tillage (weeding) period sediment transport decreased by 80 - 90 % for effective and 70 % for less effective barriers. Sediment yield could be best predicted by the erosivity index, second best by runoff amount (mm) closely followed by maximum peak intensity. All these parameters were related to the volume of overland flow needed to transport soil particles. At the research site annual rain quantities seldom gave rise to a shortage of water for vegetation barriers and sorghum. Conversely, dry spells had a big influence on soil water, exhausting it sometimes during the growing season, and causing delay in plant growth. Water loss by evaporation was negligible under (effective) Andropogon and substantial under (less effective) Ziziphus barriers. Reduced evaporation and the larger effect on runoff reduction compensated the high transpiration of Andropogon. Most barriers transpired without restrictions, when water was readily available. Only Piliostigma showed to limit transpiration during the second part of the growing season. The soil water content was monitored twice a week at different measuring depths with the TDR technique at a transect perpendicular to the barriers. For the investigated <b>alley</b> <b>crop</b> system it was found that, despite the difference in effectiveness of the barriers and soil water dynamics, there were no striking differences in yield (grain and straw) between the treatments in the distinct years. However, there were big differences in crop yields between the respective years. These differences were strongly related to the amount and the distribution of the rain over the crop development stages. When water for the sorghum crop was not always readily available during the growing season, but when rain distribution and rain quantity were favourable (1999), yields were close to average on-station yields. In the dry year 1998, there was a total annual amount of rain to produce maximum yields, but a number of dry spells had a big influence. In 1998, about half of the annual water and in 1999, only about a third of the available annual water was used for crop production. Effective barriers conserved water even during dry years and compensated at least their own consumption and increased crop yields over a distance of about 6 m upstream of the barrier. Since the soil water was always enhanced close to and under the effective (Andropogon) barrier and yields did not reflect to favourable soil water conditions, ponding and shading appeared to be important growth constraints. The barrier effect of less effective Ziziphus barriers was not good during dry years and even not enough to compensate its own consumption. In dry years, water competition was responsible for yield reductions adjacent to the barrier on the less effective barrier plots. In wet years this barrier caught enough water for its own water consumption and also enough to improve crop yields a few meters upstream. Stone row barriers sometimes retained too much runoff water causing water logging. Even in dry years the barrier effect of stone rows was less good than the effective vegetation barrier. Effective vegetation barriers were slightly better than stone rows, but the difference remained small. Management actions have to be undertaken to diminish the negative impacts, like ponding or excessive water use by the barriers. During drought the barrier has to be cut back to diminish competition. During wetness, removal of some stones in the stone row and cutting a part of the effective vegetation barrier can help to drain excess water. In farmers fields it was often observed that only short rows of Andropogon were applied. Obviously their experience is that in case of drought these short barriers catch enough water and in case of abundance, the water can flow round. Runoff management is one of the tools to increase the available water for agricultural production in areas where rainfall is erratic. From the Gampela research runoff percentages can be estimated for design purposes. Water use of vegetation barriers was related to meteorological factors and soil moisture availability and found to be simple and reliable to predict transpiration. Amongst the soil and water conservation (SWC) measures adopted in the Sahel, contour vegetation barriers (CVB) constitute a cheap option in terms of labour and material requirements. In order to understand the actual adoption and maintenance of CVB, labour requirements of commonly adopted CVB species were evaluated. Labour requirements for the installation of 100 m CVB varied from 7 - 8 man-days when using cuttings or direct sowing to 15 man-days when installed from nursery seedlings, excluding 8 days for the installation of a dead fence. Maintenance takes 2 - 4 days per 100 m. Phasing the installation over several years is an option to overcome labour constraints. Low labour requirements for establishment and management do not explain the rather low adoption and poor maintenance of vegetation barriers. The labour requirement for establishment of barriers at the beginning of the growing season is not a real constraint. Farmers mostly choose CVB species and planting methods with low labour requirements and prefer species with additional benefits such as thatching grass, oil for soap making and fodder and fruits.

Tree hedgerows were planted {{on either side of}} a 4 -m wide <b>crop</b> <b>alley.</b> Intra-row spacing between trees was 25, 50, and 100 cm. In October, 1994 and March, 1995 soil samples were taken at depths of 0 - 10 cm and 10 - 30 cm at 50 and 200 cm distance from the hedgerows using direct coring and mesh bags. Roots were separated from the soil by wet-sieving and root weight and root length density were determined. Measurements of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen to a depth of 0 - 60 cm were made. Field tensiometers were installed at 10, 30 and 60 cm depths. Soil water content was periodically monitored at similar depths. Sorghum grain yield, above-ground dry matter and height were determined. Acacia fine-root (≤ 2 mm) mass was significantly (p≤ 0. 05) higher than for Gliricidia in the top 30 cm of soil. The presence of fine roots decreased by 55 % and 40 % for Acacia and Gliricidia, respectively, as the distance increased from 50 to 200 cm from hedgerows. Increase in tree root mass was accompanied by proportionally decreased crop root mass. Results of the March samples showed that the dry period is when trees allocate a higher proportion of carbon to the root system to stay competitive under the dry conditions. Leaf and twig dry matter of Acacia was significantly (p≤ 0. 05) higher than for Gliricidia. Soil organic matter was lower by 20 % and 10 % in control and Gliricidia plots compared to Acacia plots. Soil moisture content and water potential measurements indicated that soil moisture was lower in Acacia plots than in the control and Gliricidia plots. Sorghum biomass, grain yield and height were significantly (p≤ 0. 05) higher with Gliricidia and control than with Acacia. The sorghum yield reduction with Acacia could be largely due to competition for soil moisture...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{distributions of}} tree and crop roots in agroforestry associations {{may affect the}} degree of complementarity which can be achieved in their capture of below ground resources. Trees which root more deeply than crops may intercept leaching nitrogen and thus improve nitrogen use efficiency. This hypothesis was tested by injection of small doses of (15 NH 4) 2 SO 4 at 21. 8 atom 5 N at different soil depths within established hedgerow intercropping systems on an Ultisol in Lampung, Indonesia. In the top 10 cm of soil in intercrops of maize and trees, root length density (Lrv) of maize was {{greater than that of}} Gliricidia sepium trees, which had greater Lrv in this topsoil layer than Peltophorum dasyrrachis trees. Peltophorum trees had a greater proportion of their roots in deeper soil layers than Gliricidia or maize. These vertical root distributions were related to the pattern of recovery of 15 N placed at different soil depths; more 15 N was recovered by maize and Gliricidia from placements at 5 cm depth than from placements at 45 or 65 cm depth. Peltophorum recovered similar amounts of 15 N from placements at each of these depths, and hence had a deeper N uptake distribution than Gliricidia or maize. Differences in tree Lrv across the <b>cropping</b> <b>alley</b> were comparatively small, and {{there was no significant difference}} (P< 0. 05) in the uptake of 15 N placed in topsoil at different distances from hedgerows. A greater proportion of the 15 N recovered by maize was found in grain following 15 N placement at 45 cm or 65 cm depth than following placement at 5 cm depth, reflecting the later arrival of maize roots in these deeper soil layers. Thus trees have an important role in preventing N leaching from subsoil during early crop establishment, although they themselves showed a lag phase in 15 N uptake after pruning. Residual 15 N enrichment in soil was strongly related to application depth even 406 days after 15 N placement, demonstrating the validity of this approach to mapping root activity distributions...|$|R

40|$|Nematodes {{are tiny}} worms that abound in the soil. Many species are {{harmless}} but parasitic nematodes have a mouth styles {{that allows them}} to feed on the root systems of living plants. The feeding activity of some parasitic nematodes causes the roots to grow galls or nodules that cannot be rubbed off as {{they are part of the}} root itself. It is estimated that the average farmer can lose between 12 % and 30 % of the potential crop per year from nematode attack. Losses vary greatly according to the different nematode species, found in the soil and their numbers. Population size and the balance between species are determined by the availability of suitable host plants and are highly dependent on the local soil and climate. Tropical and subtropical zones, where agroforestry is most practiced, are particularly favourable to many nematode species and total crop losses from their attacks are not rare. Permanent agroforestry systems, where trees and shrubs are inter-planted with crops are very suitable for nematode attack. This is especially so when a tree or shrub that is an ideal host for nematode survival and population build-up is present. If this is the case crop rotation which is the preferred method of nematode control, may be rendered useless. Some species of trees and shrubs can have a negative effect upon certain species of nematode. Populations will therefore be reduced, particularly if the tree or shrub acts as a trap host (attracting nematodes and preventing their reproduction] or is an antagonistic plant, exuding chemicals that kill nematodes. In Nigeria, deliberate planting of Leucaena leucocephala during the fallow period dramatically reduced parasitic nematode populations in the soil. When the fallow was converted to L. leucocephala alley-cropped with maize, the population of parasitic spiral and root lesion nematodes remained low. In West Africa, Sesbania rostrata acts as a trap host for the Hirshmaiella spp of nematode that are prevalent in flooded areas where rice grows. However studies in Malawi suggest that Acacia, Leucaena and Sesbania spp. can act as hosts for root-knot nemtatodes, allowing the populations to build up and attack many crops that are normally included in <b>alley</b> or mixed <b>cropping</b> systems. A build-up of parasitic nematode populations can be prevented by ensuring that no trees or shrubs susceptible to the nematode species naturally found in the area are introduced or cultivated on a large scale. It is also important to ensure that the trees and shrubs which are planted come from nursery sites that are as free from nematodes as possible. A more active control strategy is to include growing trees and shrubs that trap or are antagonistic to local nematodes and avoid those which may act as hosts.
