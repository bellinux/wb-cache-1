This study also tested a model which linked cultural <b>and</b> racial <b>socialization</b> beliefs to cultural <b>and</b> racial <b>socialization</b> behaviors through their respective types of self-efficacy. Findings revealed that parents' cultural <b>and</b> racial <b>socialization</b> beliefs were most important in predicting their socialization practices. There was not support for cultural socialization self-efficacy or racial socialization self-efficacy as moderators...|$|R

40|$|Research {{based on}} Latino {{heritage}} parents of adolescents highlights a positive relation between ethnic <b>and</b> racial <b>socialization</b> <b>and</b> {{ethnic and racial}} identity development. This is significant given the positive relation between ethnic and racial identity and academic and psychosocial outcomes for Latino youth. However, racial <b>and</b> ethnic <b>socialization</b> has been studied in a limited way with little attention to parents of Latino elementary school-aged children and to variability within this population. This study employed quantitative and qualitative methods, including a photo elicitation task, to explore Mexican and Salvadoran mothers’ ethnic <b>and</b> racial <b>socialization</b> practices {{within the context of}} their daily routines and children’s racial and ethnic identity formation. Findings showed that parents’ goals for their children’s education was a part of their racial <b>and</b> ethnic <b>socialization,</b> yet this only came through when utilizing a method that allowed participants to show how they experienced and defined racial <b>and</b> ethnic <b>socialization.</b> In addition, parents reported endorsing egalitarian ideals with great frequency, almost daily, with their school-aged children. Parents’ racial <b>and</b> ethnic <b>socialization</b> messages were multi-faceted and were not easily categorized as either preparation for bias, promotive of egalitarian ideals, or as fostering a color-blind perspective. Engagement in ethnic <b>and</b> racial <b>socialization</b> was variable although in general parents did not talk with their children frequently to prepare them for potential situations of bias, the did not avoid the topic of race with their children and they engaged in cultural socialization that was embedded in daily routines to a great extent than explicit cultural socialization. There was also substantial variability in how parents supported their educational goals and egalitarian ideals with their children, which to some extent was explained by contextual factors including parental work patterns, social support networks, and neighborhood ethnic and racial composition. Intersecting contextual factors impacted the sustainability of daily routines and ethnic <b>and</b> racial <b>socialization</b> such as non-standard work hours coupled with limited social supports.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} study explored {{the components of}} the assimilation stage of graduate teaching assistant (GTA) socialization. Subjects, 64 GTAs attending a large midwestern university, completed 4 survey instruments concerning their attitudes on mentoring and communication support, information seeking strategies, teacher communication concerns, <b>and</b> organizational <b>socialization</b> tactics. Results indicated that supportive communication relationships correlated with information-seeking practices, teacher communication concern, <b>and</b> organizational <b>socialization</b> tactics; <b>and</b> information-seeking practices correlated with teacher communication concern <b>and</b> organizational <b>socialization</b> tactics. Partial correlation analysis revealed three significant findings: supportive communication relationships <b>and</b> organizational <b>socialization</b> tactics; information-seeking practices and teacher communication concern; and supportive communication relationships and information-seeking practices. Findings suggest that communication is a central component of GTA socialization. Future research should explore mentor-protege relationships, peer relationships, and information seeking.

25|$|Rottweilers are a {{powerful}} breed with well-developed genetic herding and guarding instincts. Potentially dangerous behaviour in Rottweilers usually results from irresponsible ownership, abuse, neglect, {{or lack of}} socialisation and training. However, the exceptional strength of the Rottweiler is an additional risk factor not to be neglected. It {{is for this reason}} that breed experts declare that formal training and extensive socialisation are essential for all Rottweilers. According to the AKC, Rottweilers love their owners and may behave in a clownish manner toward family and friends, but they are also protective of their territory and do not welcome strangers until properly introduced. Obedience training <b>and</b> <b>socialization</b> are required.|$|E
25|$|A {{new party}} of regime supporters, the Revolutionary National Union (Unión Nacional Revolucionaria), {{was founded in}} November 1936. Although the new party called for {{representative}} democracy, rights for peasants and workers, <b>and</b> <b>socialization</b> of key industries, it failed to broaden Franco's political base. In the end, Franco lost his popular support because he failed to keep his promises to the poor. He dared not expropriate the properties of foreign landowners, who were mostly Argentines. In addition, the Liberals, who still had influential support in the army, agitated constantly for Franco's overthrow. When Franco ordered Paraguayan troops to abandon the advanced positions in the Chaco that they had held since the 1935 truce, the army revolted in August 1937 and returned the Liberals to power.|$|E
25|$|Known as {{a classic}} example of a Gentle Giant, the Saint Bernard is calm, patient and sweet with adults, and {{especially}} children. However St. Bernards, like all very large dogs, must be well socialized with people and other dogs in order to prevent fearfulness and any possible aggression or territoriality. The biggest threat to small children is being knocked over by this breed's larger size. Overall they are a sweet, gentle, calm, loyal and affectionate breed, and if socialized are very friendly. Because of its large adult size, it is essential that proper training <b>and</b> <b>socialization</b> begin while the St. Bernard is still a puppy, so as to avoid the difficulties that normally accompany training large dogs. An unruly St. Bernard may present problems for even a strong adult, so control needs to be asserted {{from the beginning of the}} dog's training. While generally not instinctively protective, a St. Bernard may bark at strangers, and their size makes them good deterrents against possible intruders.|$|E

Unfortunately, there is no scholarly consensus with respect to definitions and operations for racial <b>and</b> ethnic <b>socialization</b> which then evidences several conceptual and methodological shortcomings in racial <b>and</b> ethnic <b>socialization</b> research (Brown, 2004). Furthermore, very little empirical research has used these findings {{in relation to the}} socialization processes of first- and second-generation Afro-Caribbean emerging adults. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the roles of both racial <b>socialization</b> <b>and</b> ethnic <b>socialization</b> in promoting social connectedness (i. e., mainstream, racial community, ethnic community) and the relationship of social connectedness (i. e., mainstream, racial community, ethnic community) and subjective well-being of 307 Afro-Caribbean emerging adults. This research study tested an exploratory model that examined the potential mediating effects of social connectedness (i. e., mainstream, racial community, ethnic community) between racial <b>and</b> ethnic <b>socialization</b> <b>and</b> the outcome subjective well-being among first- and second-generation Afro-Caribbean emerging adult immigrants. Path analysis results revealed that the partially mediated for racial socialization, but fully mediated for ethnic socialization model resulted in being the best fitting model. The indirect effects of ethnic socialization on subjective well-being through social connectedness in mainstream society and ethnic community were statistically significant and also the indirect effect of racial socialization on subjective well-being through social connectedness in mainstream society was statistically significant. Research and practical implications for researchers, clinicians, and preventionists are considered, limitations and future directions for research are discussed...|$|R

When the socialization process progresses steadily, both <b>socialization</b> <b>and</b> mentoring contribute to good adjustment, but when traditional tactics go wrong, a different learning source (formal mentoring) exerts a protective function, limiting newcomers' intention to quit.
