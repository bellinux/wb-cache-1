5|$|Although {{the rocks}} beneath the city {{contained}} a vast reservoir of fresh water, {{known as the}} Trarza Lake, it is running out, owing to the large growth of the city. Engineers have warned it could run out by 2054, since it is not rain-fed, and is therefore non-renewable. The problem is particularly bad in the sandy shanty towns {{where the majority of}} the population lives. Many people already have to buy water, which is expensive compared with the <b>average</b> <b>wage.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Average</b> <b>wage</b> {{rates in}} the Soviet Union were {{published}} relatively rarely. Some academics in the West believed this was because the Soviet government wanted to conceal low average earnings. Alec Nove wrote in 1966 (when wage statistics were published {{for the first time}} since the Second World War) that the lack of transparency surrounding average wages was intended to prevent Soviet workers from discovering the huge disparities that existed between wages in different sectors of the Soviet economy.|$|E
50|$|Through intergenerational {{mobility}} research, {{the mobility}} of immigrants and their children from different nations can be measured. Considering relative wages from male workers from certain nations in 1970 to second generation male workers in 2000, conclusions can be drawn about economic mobility. In 1970, if immigrants had come from an industrialized nation, then their <b>average</b> <b>wages</b> {{tended to be more}} than the <b>average</b> <b>wages</b> of non-immigrant workers during that time. In 2000, the second generation workers had experienced a downfall in relative mobility because their <b>average</b> <b>wages</b> were much closer to the <b>average</b> <b>wages</b> of a non-immigrant worker. In 1970, for the immigrant workers migrating from less industrialized countries, their <b>average</b> <b>wages</b> were less than the <b>average</b> <b>wages</b> of non-immigrant workers. In 2000, the second generation workers from less industrialized nations have experienced an increase in relative mobility because their <b>average</b> <b>wages</b> have moved closer to those of non-immigrants.|$|R

5|$|The United States is a {{founding}} member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States (OAS), and other international organizations. The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP and second-largest economy by PPP, accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP. The U.S. economy is the fastest-growing in the Americas and is largely post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge-based activities, although the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world. Though its population is only 4.3% of the world total, Americans hold 33.2% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share of global wealth concentrated in a single country. The United States ranks among the highest nations in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including <b>average</b> <b>wage,</b> human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person. The U.S. is the foremost military power in the world, making up a third of global military spending. It is also a global leader in science and technology.|$|E
5|$|This {{practice}} was replaced in 1900 by {{a far more}} complex system of assessments and donations designed {{to raise the money}} to support strikes. This system was replaced in 1901 because it was impractical. The 1901 system required every local union and the central committee to create strike funds. Local unions would receive support for strikes from Berlin under certain circumstances, and the central Business Committee's fund would be replenished by all member organizations in amounts proportional to their membership and the <b>average</b> <b>wage</b> of their members. This system, too, proved problematic because it penalized the larger, wealthier unions— especially the construction workers in Berlin who had higher wages but also higher costs of living. From 1901 to 1903, many small organizations joined the federation, yet the FVdG's membership fell as the punitive strike support system drove some larger unions out. In 1903, the federation not only changed its name to the Free Association of German Trade Unions but also decided to return to the old system of voluntary contributions. This system remained in place until 1914. The Business Committee worked to ensure that unions contributed as much as they could. Often the committee resorted to threatening unions with expulsion in order to raise funds for a strike. Fritz Kater called this a dictatorship necessary for the movement, but local organizations still had far more autonomy than their counterparts in other German labor federations.|$|E

40|$|I {{analyze the}} {{patterns}} of migration by testing the influence of traditional economic and amenity factors and of housing market reform on the direction of migration flows. I improve on the few previous studies of Russian migration during transition by analyzing gross flows rather than net flows in order to properly distinguish effects, and by analyzing a much wider set of factors. The results indicate that even early in transition, migration responds to <b>average</b> <b>wages</b> and prices. In particular, higher <b>average</b> <b>wages</b> and lower prices positively determine immigration. Higher <b>average</b> <b>wages</b> also positively determine outmigration. Apartment privatization significantly affects migration even after only {{the first year of}} the reform. Amenity and demographic factors generally influence migration as expected.
