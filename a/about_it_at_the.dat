25|$|Saša is in {{a three-year}} {{relationship}} with bookish medical doctor Branka, but his job prospects are bleak. It's {{been a year}} since he graduated law school with average grades and he still hasn't been able to land a job. Numerous rejections are starting to affect his self-confidence and he's beginning to feel inadequate in front of Branka who graduated medicine with top marks the same year he did, but, unlike him, right away found a job that she's now excelling at. Furthermore, Branka's parents, especially mother, rarely miss an opportunity to tell him <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> unemployment bureau counter, he meets a flirty and mouthy clerk Koka who chats him up. For his part, he seems very receptive to her relaxed, direct, slightly low-brow, and provocative approach as she seems a polar opposite of his straight-laced girlfriend Branka. While out with Branka {{one day at a}} bar, Koka bumps into two of them, saying a flirty hello to Saša followed by a testy chat with Branka who is completely rattled by this encounter.|$|E

500|$|When Lennon went to Hamburg {{again in}} April 1962, {{she found a}} bedsit in a terraced house at 93 Garmoyle Road, Liverpool. Shortly after having failed her art teacher's diploma exam, in August 1962, she found she was {{pregnant}} with Lennon's child. She later explained that she and Lennon had never used contraception, had never talked about it, and didn't think <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.

500|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} substantial criticism for its strong violence and language. One scene that viewers found particularly unnerving was the ear-cutting scene; Madsen himself reportedly had great difficulty finishing it, especially after Kirk Baltz ad-libbed the desperate plea [...] "I've {{got a little}} kid at home." [...] Many people walked out during the film. During a screening at Sitges Film Festival, fifteen people walked out, including horror film director Wes Craven and special makeup effects artist Rick Baker. Baker later told Tarantino to take the walkout as a [...] "compliment" [...] and explained that he found the violence unnerving because of its heightened sense of realism. Tarantino commented <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time: [...] "It happens at every single screening. For some people the violence, or the rudeness of the language, is a mountain they can't climb. That's OK. It's not their cup of tea. But I am affecting them. I wanted that scene to be disturbing." ...|$|E

500|$|After the Netherlands' exit at Euro 2000, Overmars {{was asked}} whether he would stay at Arsenal. He replied: [...] "I really don't want to talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment but you never know. There are some {{meetings}} with the club going on, we will talk over the next week." [...] Lazio and Barcelona were reportedly interested in signing Overmars; the latter club hastened their efforts once Joan Gaspart was elected as president. Overmars was [...] "flattered" [...] by Barcelona's interest and said moving to such a club would [...] "excite any player". Gaspart travelled to London to open negotiations with Arsenal and eventually reached an agreement to sign Overmars and his teammate Emmanuel Petit for a combined fee of around £32million in July 2000. Overmars cost £25million, making him the most expensive player in Dutch football history. The announcement of his transfer was unconventional; he publicised it on his personal website before informing the media. His site garnered 250,000 hits in one day, highlighting the internet's [...] "potential for exponential growth" [...] in regards to football. Overmars was delighted with the move, saying, [...] "I can't wait to pull on the famous shirt and play my first game." ...|$|E
500|$|By spring 2001, {{the group}} were [...] "desperate" [...] to start touring; it was {{something}} which they {{had always wanted to}} do, but couldn't because things were [...] "always so hectic". After spending most of early 2001 rehearsing, the S Club Party 2001 tour began on 19 May 2001. Describing the tour, Stevens remarked that seeing a crowd of over 13,000 fans each night coming to see them was [...] "such an unbelievable feeling", and {{the other members of the}} group shared an [...] "adrenaline rush" [...] as well as a wave of emotion before going on stage. Once the tour was over, the group had to fly back to the United States in order to film the third series of their television show, Hollywood 7. This third series, which was still set in Los Angeles, was the group's favourite to film because they had more acting experience and could [...] "drop their shoulders" [...] and start to enjoy themselves. The group, however, had to continuously cope with intense schedules and early starts whilst recording for the programme, something which, although the group felt [...] "laid back" [...] <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, was to eventually take its toll and lead to the demise of the band. Hollywood 7 began airing in September 2001 and dealt with the issue of an on-screen kiss between Spearritt and Cattermole, who had begun dating in real life. Their relationship, which was kept secret for six months, was well received by the band who claimed it had made them all closer as friends. Hollywood 7 aired alongside a new CBBC reality show, S Club Search, which invited children to extend the S Club brand and audition to form a younger version of the band. The new group were to be chosen to sing with S Club 7 on Children in Need 2001 and go on tour with them on their future S Club 7 Carnival 2002 tour. The eight children who went on to form the band named themselves S Club Juniors and had six top ten UK hits.|$|E

2500|$|After Titanic sank, Jones {{suggested}} {{going back}} to save some {{of those in the}} water. Only three passengers agreed; the rest refused, fearing that the boat would be capsized by desperate swimmers. Jones acquiesced, but told them: [...] "Ladies, if any of us are saved, remember I wanted to go back. I would rather drown with them than leave them." [...] The passengers' conduct during the subsequent hours presented some striking contrasts. Lady Rothes– who {{had been one of the}} few passengers to support a rescue attempt– took charge of the tiller and put others to work at the oars. Her conduct was later complimented by Jones, who called her [...] "more of a man than any we had aboard" [...] and gave her the lifeboat's numeral 8, in a frame, as a keepsake. In fact, when Walter Lord, author of A Night to Remember, interviewed the Countess and Seaman Jones in 1954, he discovered their mutual admiration had led to a lifelong correspondence. By contrast, Ella White was so annoyed that the stewards in lifeboat number 8 were smoking cigarettes that she complained <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> US Senate inquiry into the disaster; she was particularly indignant that one of the ship's crewmen had said to another during the night: [...] "If you don't stop talking through that hole in your face, there will be one less in the boat!" ...|$|E
