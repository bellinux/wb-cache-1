25|$|Herman A. Rosenblat (1929 – February 5, 2015) was a Polish-born American {{writer who}} wrote a fictitious Holocaust memoir titled Angel <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fence,</b> {{purporting}} to tell {{the true story of}} a girl who passed him food through the barbed-wire fence at the Schlieben sub-camp of the Buchenwald concentration camp in World War II. The book was planned to be published in 2009 by Berkely Books, but was cancelled after it turned out that many elements of his memoir were fabricated and some were contrary to verifiable historical facts. Rosenblat later admitted to lying on purpose with the intention of bringing joy.|$|E
25|$|Preventative {{measures}} {{are employed in}} areas where avalanches pose a significant threat to people, such as ski resorts, mountain towns, roads, and railways. There {{are several ways to}} prevent avalanches and lessen their power and destruction; active preventative measures reduce the likelihood and size of avalanches by disrupting the structure of the snowpack, while passive measures reinforce and stabilize the snowpack in situ. The simplest active measure is repeatedly traveling on a snowpack as snow accumulates; this can be by means of boot-packing, ski-cutting, or machine grooming. Explosives are used extensively to prevent avalanches, by triggering smaller avalanches that break down instabilities in the snowpack, and removing overburden that can result in larger avalanches. Explosive charges are delivered by a number of methods including hand-tossed charges, helicopter-dropped bombs, Gazex concussion lines, and ballistic projectiles launched by air cannons and artillery. Passive preventive systems such as snow fences and light walls can be used to direct the placement of snow. Snow builds up around the fence, especially the side that faces the prevailing winds. Downwind of the fence, snow buildup is lessened. This is caused by the loss of snow <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> that would have been deposited and the pickup of the snow that is already there by the wind, which was depleted of snow <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> When there is a sufficient density of trees, they can greatly reduce the strength of avalanches. They hold snow in place and when there is an avalanche, the impact of the snow against the trees slows it down. Trees can either be planted or they can be conserved, such as in the building of a ski resort, to reduce the strength of avalanches.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{advanced}} to the NLCS {{for the first time}} since 2009, where they faced off with the St. Louis Cardinals. In the first game of the series at Busch Stadium, Zack Greinke allowed only two runs in eight innings, while striking out a season high 10 batters, the first pitcher to strike out 10 Cardinals in a post-season game since Denny Galehouse in the 1944 World Series. Andre Ethier, making his first post-season start of the season after being limited to pinch hitting the previous round, just missed catching Carlos Beltrán's double <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> to allow the two runs to score in the third. The Dodgers also managed two runs, on a single by Juan Uribe in the top of the third. The game remained tied into extra innings until Beltran recorded the walk-off hit off Kenley Jansen in the bottom of the 13th inning to give the Cardinals a 3-2 victory. This was the longest game in Dodgers post-season history since the 1916 World Series. In the second game, Clayton Kershaw and two relievers combined to allow only 2 hits and 1 run but that was enough as the Dodgers offense failed to score at all and they lost 1-0. Kershaw was the first starting pitcher in post-season history to lose a game while allowing no earned runs and two or fewer hits.|$|E

500|$|At around 11 a.m., Doubleday {{sent his}} reserve regiment, the 6th Wisconsin, an Iron Brigade regiment, {{commanded}} by Lt. Col. Rufus R.

The Wisconsin men paused <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> along the pike and fired, which halted Davis's attack on Cutler's men and caused many of them to seek cover in the unfinished railroad cut. The 6th joined the 95th New York and the 84th New York (also known as the 14th Brooklyn), a [...] "demi-brigade" [...] commanded by Col. E.B. Fowler, along the pike. The three regiments charged to the railroad cut, where Davis's men were seeking cover. The majority of the 600-foot (180 m) cut (shown on the map as the center cut of three) was too deep to be an effective firing positionas deep as 15 feet (4.5 m). Making the situation more difficult was the absence of their overall commander, General Davis, whose location was unknown.|$|E

2500|$|An {{article was}} {{published}} February 3, 1890 describing {{a series of}} events from Adam's Station, Tennessee. At dusk, January 27, 1890, Mr. Hollaway reported watching two unknown women arrive at his home and dismount from their horses as he was feeding cattle. When he arrived at the house, the horses and women were gone. Mr. Hollaway's wife reported seeing the women in the yard as well. That week, Mr. Rowland attempted to place a sack of corn on his horse's back and it fell off. He again attempted to place the sack of corn on the horse's back several more times, but each time the sack fell off. Joe Johnson arrived and held on to the sack as Mr. Hollaway mounted his horse.

2500|$|... 1896 was {{his most}} {{successful}} year in sport. On 3 March he also represented the 9th Lancers at Racquets in the Grand Military Championship Challenge Cup. On 7 March he was {{fourth in the}} Grand Military Handicap Steeplechase, according to a contemporary report in The Times, this time riding Nelly Gray, a horse belonging to an officer from the 16th Lancers. However, some later sources, such as his obituary in The Times, state that he won the Grand Military that year, probably based on his own entry in Who's Who. Though he had actually sold Soarer to Hall Walker a few weeks earlier, that was still the horse he rode to his greatest victory, in the Grand National at Aintree on 27 March. The Times the following day described how he [...] "drew to the front two fences from home and won by a length and half". It {{was at this point}} that [...] "Soarer" [...] became his own nickname. He also repeated his victory in the Irish National Hunt Cup (this time on Lord Arravale); and in polo, 1896 saw him on the winning side in both the Subalterns' and the Inter-Regimental tournaments, a record still unmatched at his death. In 1897, Campbell tried to repeat his Grand National triumph, once more on Soarer, but he fell on the second lap of the course <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> after Becher's Brook, breaking his collar bone.
