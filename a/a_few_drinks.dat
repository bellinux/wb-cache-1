The two spend the evening in conversation over <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>drinks</b> at Sissener's house, and Odd is led to realisations about his own life. It emerges that his mothera free-spirited womanwas a ski jumper, but Odd himself never {{had the courage to}} try the sport. He now feels as if he has let her down, by never having the courage to seize the day and try new things.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, {{for seven}} months of each year, the trio's filming {{schedule}} would go on hiatus, allowing them to make personal appearances. The Stooges entertained servicemen constantly, and the intense work schedule took its toll on Curly. He never drank while performing in film or on stage; Moe would not allow it. But once away from Moe's watchful eye, he would find the nearest nightclub, down <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>drinks,</b> and enjoy himself. His drinking, eating, and carousing increased. He had difficulties managing his finances, often spending his money on wine, food, women, homes, cars, and especially dogs, and was often near bankruptcy. Moe eventually helped him manage his money and even filled out his income tax returns.|$|E
25|$|Three {{weeks after}} the murder of Ernest Miller, on September 24, Dahmer {{encountered}} a 22-year-old father of one named David Thomas at the Grand Avenue Mall and persuaded {{him to return to}} his apartment for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>drinks,</b> with additional money on offer if he would pose for photographs. In his statement to police after his arrest, Dahmer stated that after giving Thomas a drink laden with sedatives, he did not feel attracted to him, but was afraid to allow him to awake in case he would be angry over having been drugged. Therefore, he strangled him and dismembered the body—intentionally retaining no body parts whatsoever. Nonetheless, he did photograph the dismemberment process and retained these photographs, which would aid in Thomas' subsequent identification.|$|E
25|$|Clark {{waited a}} month before {{striking}} again. Meanwhile, Bundy was still infatuated with Jack Murray. She would go see him sing and after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>drinks,</b> her conversation would turn to things she and Clark were doing. Murray was alarmed and implied that he might tell the police. In order to avoid this from happening, in August 1980, Bundy lured Murray into his van after a show to have sex. Once they were inside, she shot him and decapitated him. She left various clues behind, however, such {{as the fact that}} the two of them were seen together in the bar, and she had left shell casings in the van. Bundy couldn't take the pressure and two days later she confessed to her co-workers that she had killed Murray. They called the police and she began to give them a full and to-the-point confession about her and Clark's crimes.|$|E

25|$|That night, Matamoros {{was flooded}} with 15,000 spring {{tourists}} from the U.S. on the city's main tourist street, Álvaro Obregón. The sidewalks, street, and night clubs were packed with foreign tourists looking to enjoy cheap alcohol and enjoy Mexico's lax drinking laws. When they got to Matamoros, Kilroy and his friends {{decided to go to}} the bar with the shortest waiting line. They ended up at Los Sombreros, a bar with rock music and bright neon. After <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>drinks,</b> Kilroy and his friends left Los Sombreros and wandered to London Pub, which rebranded itself as Hardrock Café for spring break. This bar was louder and wilder than Los Sombreros, and Kilroy and his friends stood at the bar while other tourists threw beer from the balcony. Kilroy met with a few girls at the bar and was not seen by his friends for a while. Around 2:00a.m. CT, Bill suggested the group head back to South Padre Island. As his friends stepped out of London Pub, they saw Kilroy leaning against a car and talking to a girl from Miss Tanline. Across Álvaro Obregón street, thousands of tourists were leaving the bars and heading to Brownsville, but others moved in different directions. The large crowd of people made it difficult for Kilroy and his friends to walk across the border uninterrupted and in a group.|$|E

500|$|Most 798ers were {{characterized}} by a Southern accent, cowboy boots, and unique welder's hats. They {{were the only people}} to weld the [...] pipe of the main pipeline, and outside observers characterized them as arrogant and [...] "redneck". As a fellow welder stated at the time, [...] "Take your typical 798 pipeline welder and feed him <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>drinks,</b> and he'll probably tell you that he's God's greatest gift to welding." [...] This attitude generated resentment from other pipeline workers, and the conflict caused large-scale brawls. In some instances, Alaska State Troopers had to be flown to pipeline camps in order to break up small riots. Toward the end of the pipeline project, a series of bumper stickers was produced with the slogan [...] "Happiness is 10,000 Okies going south with a Texan under each arm." ...|$|E
500|$|Mars further {{confessed that}} by the time he started to develop his songwriting skills, he learned his [...] "most {{valuable}} lesson", [...] "Does it make you move? Make you dance? Whether the song is uptempo or a ballad", adding that [...] "there has to be a heartbeat in back of it. There needs to be a pulse in the song". To American Songwriter, Philip Lawrence from The Smeezingtons recalled sleepless nights during the record's process, as the team was trying to prove that the debut album [...] "wasn't a fluke", which according to Lawrence is [...] "the absolute wrong mind-set to be". He went on expressing that the first four or five months they worked on the record were fruitless, because [...] "nothing would stick". When they decided to leave the studio and have <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>drinks,</b> they came to conclusion to relax and not put themselves under so much pressure; it resulted in [...] "the ideas [...] coming out again." ...|$|E
500|$|The second {{music video}} for [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] was also {{directed}} by Motellet Film. It was filmed at a Swedish {{club in the}} span of three days, where the singer spent time with three friends who were asked to [...] "have <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>drinks</b> and make out" [...] with her. Consequently, the directors filmed a large amount of natural footage because there was not a specific [...] "direction". Regarding the fact that two of her friends were women, Lo expressed: [...] "There are girls in there—one of them is my best friend. That should be OK, that shouldn't even be a thing." [...] In the video, the singer wanted to [...] "show this kind of night where things can get out of control" [...] and the viewers to [...] "go slowly into this emotional turmoil" [...] represented in the lyrics of the song. She explained: [...] "I want people to know what I'm feeling. I want it to really reflect the song. So I wanted to make a video that I'm not able to watch, which is kind of what it is." ...|$|E

[...] They would then [...] "sit around, smoke <b>a</b> <b>few,</b> <b>drink</b> <b>a</b> few", and create ideas for new songs. However, recording sessions became difficult as André 3000 grew tired of rapping on songs, which made Big Boi and the producers uneasy about how the music would sound. [...] To maintain musical cohesion with Big Boi while continuing to expand his vocal palette, André decided to combine rapping with soul-inspired crooning, which had {{a major influence on}} Stankonias sound. [...] "Snappin & Trappin'" [...] features a guest appearance from then-unknown rapper Killer Mike. The rapper noted that while working with OutKast, he used the opportunity to try to [...] "compete" [...] with the duo to improve his rapping skills. Big Boi was impressed with Killer Mike's abilities, noting, [...] "When I first heard him spit, his voice was just so commanding. [...] He's a very intelligent guy." ...|$|R
