40|$|Abstract [...] An {{excavator}} is {{a typical}} hydraulic heavy-duty human-operated machine used in general versatile construction operations, such as digging, ground leveling, carrying loads, dumping loads and straight traction. Normally backhoe excavators are working under worst working conditions. Due to severe working conditions, excavator parts are subjected to high loads and must work reliably under unpredictable working conditions. The objective {{of this paper is}} to analyze the existing design and redesign the excavator boom which is suitable for side digging and also for digging over hanged part of wall. Modeling of excavator attachment like boom, long arm, small <b>arm,</b> <b>cylinder,</b> bucket & coupling is done by using INVENTOR software. Model is exported through IGES file format for MESHING in Altair Hypermesh Analysis Software. Meshing is done using suitable type of elements. Material property is assigned; Boundary conditions and the forces are applied. Static analysis is done in INVERTOR software which is being supported by ANSYS software. During operation of excavator at different positions the stresses induced in the attachments varies. The forces applied in the analysis were calculated by using INVENTOR software, and reported that the Arm, Boom and Bucket shows stress in the attachment are coming under allowable limit. For reducing stresses and for optimum weight of the excavator parts, thickness of the material is reduced in the modeling. Keyword [...] Rotary excavator boom, bucket, INVENTOR software. I...|$|E

Design and {{analysis}} of multi body system is a challenging task that requires the knowledge of machine design, computer aided design (CAD), finite element analysis and structural dynamics. Wheel loader vehicle {{is a type of}} earth moving machine which falls in the category of multi body system. This project is based on the concepts of reverse engineering where in which the wheel loader is designed and analyzed to precision. Initially the dimensions of the wheel loader are documented by using vernier caliper and full scale ruler. These dimensions are vitally implemented in generating the 3 D model of the wheel loader. SolidWorks has been used for 3 D model creation. In order to run the design to real time standards a few design modifications are taken into account. Design of lift <b>arm</b> <b>cylinders,</b> lift <b>arms,</b> tilt/bucket <b>cylinder</b> and connecting rod are modified to real time standards. Kinematics of wheel loader has been analyzed in SolidWorks. For kinetics and structural analysis the model has been exported from SolidWorks to MSC Visual Nastran Desktop 4 D. In order to analyze the structural dynamics, the method of finite element analysis is used. The results obtain from the stress analysis are within the range of yield stress of materials used for designing of wheel loader.

40|$|Abstract. The {{automation}} {{of mobile}} working equipment used in farming, forestry {{and the construction}} industry has great market potential. Tasks of a highly complex nature could be executed without intervention of the operator. Despite the potential significance of this topic, only very few results of international research projects in robotics have heretofore been applied in the serial production of commercial vehicles. The joint project AMoBa (Autonomer Mobiler Bagger, Autonomous Mobile Excavator) of Kaiserslautern University and Volvo CE aims to transfer knowledge and experience {{from the field of}} robotics to the area of mobile excavators. The objective is the realization of fully autonomous operation in basic construction activities, such as terrain modeling or trenching. For this purpose a prototype is being prepared by modifying an 18 t Volvo Mobile Excavator to meet the project’s requirements. It is being equipped with electronic interfaces to control all relevant functions; i. e. the hydraulic <b>arm</b> <b>cylinders,</b> thereby employing sensor devices for the acquisition of the kinematics (i. e. travel sensors or angular sensors) and sensors for the acquisition of the environment surrounding the robotic excavator. For example, 2 -D laser scanning devices and 3 D cameras. Mechanical and hydraulic simulation models are being created to enable studies of suitable algorithms for trajectory control of the excavators’ kinematics. Algorithms concerning the global task of processing the automation task are developed and tested in the software framework MCA 2 before they are ported to the prototype. The MCA 2 framework combines the simulation of the excavator and its environment, including the simulation of environment sensors. On completion of this project, the algorithms developed in the simulation will be verified on the prototype. ...|$|R
50|$|The M121 engine {{featured}} a single chain driven overhead camshaft layout with staggered valves operated by {{long and short}} rocker <b>arms.</b> The <b>cylinder</b> block was made from cast iron. The cylinder bore diameter for the M121 was 85 milimeters. The three ring crankshaft was forged. The stroke of the engine was 83.6 mm. This gave the M121 a displacement of 1897 cc, or 1.9 liters when rounded. The engine had a compression of 8.5:1. Through this configuration, the M121 BII engine had an initial rating of 110 horsepower at 5500 RPM and 114 lb-ft of torque at 4000 RPM. After testing of the final vehicle, the horsepower rating was lowered to 105. The crankshaft was carried by three main bearings. In the 190 SL, the engine had two parallel carburetors.|$|R

Lifters or tappets {{are located in the}} engine block between the camshaft and pushrods. By contrast, overhead camshaft design avoids the use of pushrods by putting the camshaft directly above the valves in the cylinder head, thus simplifying the valvetrain.|$|R

40|$|Digital {{hydraulics}} is {{an ongoing}} trend that offers many interesting advantages and possibilities. Digital refers to that the system output is discrete, e. g. using an on/off valve with only discrete values or a finite amount of flow steps available. The advantages mentioned when compared to analogue systems are better performance, robust and fault tolerant, and amplitude independent bandwidth. On the other side noise and pressure pulsations must be handled, the physical size can be a problem, and the system requires complicated control. When considering control of linear motion, there are mainly two branches, controlling the flow with several parallel connected on/off valves, which generates discrete output flow values, or switching valves, which in theory can generate any mean output flow. The latter only requires one valve for each flow path but the demand for fast valves is very high, while the former requires many valves but avoids high frequent switching. With {{the introduction of a}} multi-chamber cylinder, secondary control is now also possible for linear motion. This paper is a first step in the investigation of the system applied to an excavator <b>arm.</b> The <b>cylinder</b> has four chambers, each with different area. Three pressure lines are used and a valve-pack of 27 on/off valves. The valve-pack connects the three pressure lines with each chamber generating 81 available force steps. The scope has been to start out with relative simple control of the velocity of the cylinder. To handle unnecessary switching of valves, different penalty strategies were tested. The results are promising where relatively smooth control could be achieved at the same time challenges with the system were identified. Next step is to investigate the force transients due to different capacitance in all four chambers as well as mode control for better accuracy. Energy potential compared to original system remains to investigate as well...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringSteve EckelsA new human {{thermal model}} was {{developed}} to predict the thermal responses of human body in various environments. The new model was based on Smith's model, which employed finite element method to discretize the human body. The body parts in our new model were {{not limited to the}} cylindrical shape as in Smith's model, but subjected to arbitrary shapes. Therefore, the new model is capable of dealing with more complicated shapes of the human body. Steady-state and transient temperatures of fifteen body parts were calculated for three environments: cold, neutral, and warm. Our results were compared with the data from Zhang's experimental research on the human subjects. For all three conditions, our results showed better agreement with experimental data than Smith's results did. The maximal deviation is 1 ºC for neutral and warm condition; for cold condition, a maximal deviation of 3. 5 ºC is reported at hand. The comparison indicated that our new model could provide a more accurate prediction on the body temperatures. Follow-up experiments were conducted to investigate the local and overall heat transfer from a moving cylinder in air flow. This study was expected to provide the local convective heat transfer coefficients of the human body to our new human thermal model to simulate moving humans. An experiment of a stationary cylinder in cross flow was performed to verify the accuracy and consistency of our system. Then, the experiment of a transverse oscillating cylinder in cross flow was conducted, with a oscillation frequency of 0. 15 and Strouhal number of 0. 3 to 1. 5, depending on wind velocity. The overall Nusselt number (Nu) of the oscillating cylinder remained unaffected, compared to the stationary cylinder. This observation showed agreement with previous studies. The pivot experiment was performed to investigate swinging movement of human <b>arms.</b> The <b>cylinder</b> was positioned axially in cross flow, and reciprocated on a fixed point between horizontal and vertical positions under three wind speeds and two oscillating frequencies. The results showed that the overall Nu was between the Nu at horizontal and vertical positions in stationary state. A correlation was presented to predict the Nu of pivotal moving cylinder by using stationary Nu at horizontal and vertical positions. The correlation was proved to be valid (error less than 5 %) within the range of conditions in our experiment...|$|R
40|$|Slot-cutting {{tests were}} made in a 3. 5 in. OD steel pipe {{representative}} of the proposed liner of the twin gravel-packed horizontal drainholes used in this Method, for the following purposes: (1) To determine the force required to punch through the liner wall {{in order to achieve}} its full penetration with a cutting wheel, (2) To select the most effective profile for the cutting wheel. The results of these tests, made at UC-Berkeley indicated that, with four cutting wheels, as included in the tool design presented in the Fourth Quarterly Report, the total force required was nearly 60, 000 lb. In view of the limited tool diameter, the creation of such a large force with a single piston required a hydraulic pressure which would exceed the capability of the Triplex pump, most commonly available in the oil fields. A re-design of the 4 -wheel slot-cutting tool with two tandem pistons was done, but revealed a high degree of complexity, related to the difficulty of providing a high-pressure fluid path in the thin housing wall from the hydraulic cylinder above the first pair of <b>arms</b> to a <b>cylinder</b> for the tandem piston located below the first pair of cutter arms and operating the second pair of arms. By reducing the number of cutting wheels from 4 to 3 a single piston driver was sufficient and could result in a tool much simpler to build and to maintain in the Field. The re-designed 3 -wheel slot-cutting tool is presented here. It is currently under construction at UC-Berkeley. A second test program will follow, when this simplified modular tool has been assembled. The objective of this second series of tests is to determine the required characteristics of the opposing spring, or Belleville rings stack which, in the new design, is used for retraction of the cutters, rather than for their extension...|$|R
40|$|Opening roof cars {{can be used}} in {{transportation}} of a diversity of goods that require weather protection. Their operation allows us to fulfill the tasks of the Ministry of Railways that is to ensure both the qualitative and lossless transportation of various national economy and special loads and the significant improvement in the technical and economic indexes of the industry. Thus, there are three embodiment options of the opening roofs: single-leaf roof with axial of rotation along one car side; double-leaf roof with axial of rotation of its flaps along both car sides; single-leaf roof with axial of rotation along the car end wall. The work analyses and compares the first two options of the opening systems of the car roof. Analysis of various schemes of opening the roof-insulated cars is based on kinematic and force calculations. The paper defines how the changing length of hydraulic cylinders depends on the stroke and on the arm of applied force, depending on the opening roof angle for various embodiment options. To find the forces acting on the cylinders were determined the forces acting on the roof and the total applied moment of all the forces acting on them with respect to the axial of rotation. Thus, the total applied moment was considered to comprise the weighting unbalance moments of the roof and snow on it, as well as a moment of the force of wind acting on the roof (dead wind or downwind). Upon finding how the changing total moment of the force applied to the roof depends on the rotation angle and on the change of the applied force <b>arm</b> of hydraulic <b>cylinders,</b> the work determines the forces acting on the cylinders. The maximum tensile and compression force acting on the cylinders allows us to define their geometric characteristics such as piston stroke, diameter of the rod, piston-and rod-working cavity. Using a software package SADAS (developed at the Department "Rocket Launching Complexes" in BMSTU) the core models were built and designed for considered structural scheme to open a car roof with beam cross-sections and their dimensions for the roof designs under consideration assumed to be identical. Comparison of calculation results for various opening options has shown that a double-leaf roof car has a number of advantages as compared with that of the single-leaf roof. The double-leaf opening scheme allows us to use more compact and easy-to-implement hydraulic cylinders. With the double-leaf roof, a design of all power components of the car is under less loads, and therefore, in optimization of this design will be used the cross-sections of the power components of smaller area, thereby leading to reduced weight and size characteristics of the entire design. Tightness of the internal volume of the car with a double-leaf opening roof can be provided through using both the structural components to open the car roof and the cutting-edge leak-proofing and sealing materials...|$|R
