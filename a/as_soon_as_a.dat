5|$|Initially, the Court of Chancery {{would not}} {{entertain}} {{a request to}} administer an estate <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> flaw in the will was discovered, rather leaving it to the ecclesiastical courts, but from 1588 onwards the Court did deal with such requests, in four situations: where it was alleged that there were insufficient assets; where it was appropriate to force a legatee to give a bond to creditors (which could not {{be done in the}} ecclesiastical courts); to secure femme covert assets from a husband; and where the deceased's debts had to be paid before the legacies were valid.|$|E
5|$|The hunt of {{the pilot}} whale is known by the locals as the Grindadráp. There are no fixed hunting seasons. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pod close enough to land is spotted, the locals set out to begin the hunt, after {{approval}} from the sysselman. The animals are driven into a bay which is approved for whaling by the Faroese government, and then {{they try to make}} the whales to beach themselves. The only way out is being blocked off by some of the boats, which stay there until men who have been waiting on shore have slaughtered all the whales.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} has a {{complete}} moult between July and September, {{although there is}} considerable individual variation in timing. There is a partial pre-breeding moult, mainly between January and March, but with much variability in timing. This moult typically involves replacing the head, body and some wing feathers, but the extent is again variable. Very occasionally, females may moult into what looks like non-breeding plumage, rather than the expected brighter garb. The chicks start to gain juvenile plumage <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> month after hatching, and most have completed the transition to near-adult appearance by September. The first pre-breeding moult {{is similar to that}} of the adult, but may be less complete or even absent.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two types}} of slope posture, a pre-copulatory one and an {{ordinary}} one. The pre-copulatory behavior of scaly-breasted munia includes a sequence of actions. The first involves either the male or female playing with nest-material. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bird has arranged the nest material in its bill, it begins to fly around in a zig-zag path. Once a bird lands close to its partner, the male bends towards the female and wipes its bill. The male then sings with movements of the body. The female invites mounting with tail quivering.|$|E
5|$|Georges, an only child, showed early {{aptitude}} {{for music and}} quickly picked up the basics of musical notation from his mother, who probably gave him his first piano lessons. By listening {{at the door of}} the room where Adolphe conducted his classes, Georges learned to sing difficult songs accurately from memory and developed an ability to identify and analyse complex chordal structures. This precocity convinced his ambitious parents that he was ready to begin studying at the Conservatoire even though he was still only nine years old (the minimum entry age was 10). Georges was interviewed by Joseph Meifred, the horn virtuoso who was a member of the Conservatoire's Committee of Studies. Meifred was so struck by the boy's demonstration of his skills that he waived the age rule and offered to take him <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> place became available.|$|E
5|$|Though {{breeding}} can {{be improved}} by supplementary feeding, the survival of young kakapo is hampered {{by the presence of}} Polynesian rats. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats. Nest protection has been intensified since 1995 by using traps and poison stations <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nest had been detected. A small video camera and infra-red light source watch the nest continuously, and will scare approaching rats with flashing lights and loud popping sounds. To increase the success rate of nesting, a nest watcher places a small thermostatically controlled electric blanket over the eggs or chicks, whenever the female leaves the nest for food. The survival rate of chicks has increased from 29% in unprotected nests to 75% in protected ones.|$|E

5|$|The {{cooperative}} gameplay {{originated from}} players' requests and from anecdotes of players {{working together on}} the same computer or console to solve the game's puzzles. Wolpaw likened this to players working together on the same computer to solve point-and-click adventure games. The cooperative campaign was also inspired by Valve's Left 4 Dead cooperative games, in which players enjoyed discussing their personal experiences with the game when they had finished playing it. While the single player campaign in Portal 2 is designed to avoid frustrating the player, the cooperative levels focus on coordination and communication, and Valve recognizes {{they are much more}} difficult than the single-player puzzles. Valve did not include timed puzzles in the single-player campaigns in Portal and Portal 2, but found that their inclusion in the cooperative mode is effective and gives players a positive feeling after they successfully plan and execute difficult maneuvers. Each puzzle chamber in the cooperative mode requires four portals to solve to prevent puzzles being solved by the actions of only one player. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> playtester discovered a way to complete a puzzle with one set of portals, the level was sent back to the designers for further work. Except in a few cases, Valve designed the chambers so that both players would remain in sight of each other to promote communication and cooperation. Some of the puzzle chambers were designed asymmetrically; one player would manipulate portals and controls to allow the other player to cross the room, emphasizing that the two characters, while working together, are separate entities. The designers soon realized that the ability to tag surfaces with instructional icons for one's partner was a necessary element, since they found this to be more effective for cooperation than simple, verbal instructions.|$|E

25|$|In 1971, Lorraine Rothman and Carol Downer, {{founding}} {{members of the}} feminist self-help movement, invented the Del-Em, a safe, cheap suction device {{that made it possible}} for people with minimal training to perform early abortions called menstrual extraction. During the mid-1990s in the United States the medical community showed renewed interest in manual vacuum aspiration as a method of early surgical abortion. This resurgence is due to technological advances that permit early pregnancy detection (<b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> week after conception) and a growing popular demand for safe, effective early abortion options, both surgical and medical. An innovator in the development of early surgical abortion services is Jerry Edwards, a physician, who developed a protocol in which women are offered an abortion using a handheld vacuum syringe <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> positive pregnancy test is received. This protocol also allows the early detection of an ectopic pregnancy.|$|E
