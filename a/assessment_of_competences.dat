A content analysis <b>of</b> the <b>assessments</b> employed by each school was used to help discussion and inform the Delphi process. Results: Seven schools currently employ a summative <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> in forceps exodontia, with the majority employing a structured clinical objective test (n = 6). From the seven assessments, there were a total of 29 putative items and 10 putative domains identified for a generic checklist.

In this proposal we present {{the development and implementation of}} an e-portfolio system in a university virtual classroom that represents several assessment methods of learning in virtual learning contexts taking into account their cognitive consequences for learning. Although the e-portfolio includes different types of assessment methods including those of automated correction, special emphasis is made on processes that assess positive progress of learning. E-portfolio helps and assesses learning quality according to their use in four different types of learning assessment: 1) initial assessment, 2) constructive and formative assessment, 3) final and summative assessment and 4) self-assessment.

We collected evidence by undertaking needs assessments with educators, practitioners and patients. We have determined the genetics knowledge, skills and attitudes which they said were needed and translated these into learning outcomes and workforce competences in a continuum of education. Beginning with core concepts introduced (and examined) pre-registration, the continuum continues with development of concepts post-registration as appropriate for role, leading to practical application and <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> in the workplace. These are supported by a portfolio of resources which draw heavily on patient based scenarios to demonstrate to staff that genetics is relevant to their work, and to convince educators and policy makers that genetic education is likely to result in real clinical benefit.

It also considers communicative skills which bachelors should possess at the present stage of contemporary education. Among them are: analyzing synthesizing, argumentation, speculation and some other which can be useful in professional communication in foreign language. Some helpful advice is offered on how to develop professional communicative competence. Currently, higher professional education is in the course of transition to the new federal state standards of education. According to the new standards, foreign language proficiency is identified as one of basic cultural competences of a graduate of higher education institutions, irrespective of his or her speciality or specialization. A foreign language course is retained among other obligatory basic courses in arts, social sciences, and economics. Moreover, the strategic concept of European cooperation in education through 2020 identifies the objectives of foreign language proficiency with regard to the need to strengthen and to develop the systemic interrelation between education and innovative research. The term "competence building approach" is used in the Russian system of education. This term is widely used in official documents. The competence building approach means transition from the assessment of knowledge as the dominant practice to the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>competences,</b> or the capability to process the ever-growing amount of information (in the event of a foreign language course, the information is processed in a foreign language).

En estos sistemas, el cambio en la concepción pedagógica y de renovación metodológica en el proceso de enseñanza-aprendizaje supone un proceso muy complejo, no exento de retos y dificultades. Este artículo pretende conocer cómo se está planteando la evaluación en competencias, principalmente las genéricas, en un modelo blended-learning. Para ello, analizamos el proceso de implantación de los nuevos Grados en la UNED, en el curso académico 2009 / 10, desde la perspectiva del diseño de las nuevas asignaturas. Los resultados corresponden a dos fases de análisis: una de carácter cuantitativo, mediante el análisis de las guías de estudio elaboradas por los equipos docentes; y otra de carácter cualitativo, con la realización de entrevistas a responsables de la implantación de títulos y equipos docentes, para conocer sus valoraciones del proceso de adaptación al EEES. En ambos análisis se hace hincapié en el nuevo modelo de evaluación de competencias y en el uso de protocolos homogéneos, como las rúbricas.

The challenges posed by assessing learning in competence-based education become clearer when we deal with blended-learning systems, increasingly common even among “traditional” universities. In these systems, changes in pedagogic design and methodological renewal in the teaching and learning imply a series of complex processes. This article describes how the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>competences,</b> especially generic ones, is being carried out in a blended-learning model. In order to do this, we analyse the introduction of new EHEA Degrees in UNED, in the 2009 / 10 academic year, {{from the point of view}} of the design of new courses. Our results are derived from two empirical phases: a quantitative one, in which we analyse study guides handed out to students by lecturers; and a qualitative one, for which we have carried out 23 in-depth interviews with those responsible for the implementation of degrees and lecturers, in order to find out about their views of the EHEA adaptation process. In both phases we stress the new competence-based assessment model and the use of homogenous protocols, such as rubrics. </p...|$|E

It is an increase of almost 14 % on the amount in 2004. The FEACO (in English: European Federation of Management Consultancy Associations), which was created in 1960, is an independent professional organization with non lucrative goal. Recently, the FEACO founded a new grid of reading of the activities carried out by the management consultancy companies. It has the role of representing and of promoting Management Consultancy profession in Europe. In the spheres of the professionals in HR, the increase in the sales turnover in the field remains partly ascribable to the actions of their federation. As for the French HR market, it follows a strong marketing policy directed towards the innovation of the services and the respect of the ethical values of the profession. So many companies try to increase their market presence {{as a result of the}} putting in place of a network offer and of creation of new services panel. The objective of this contribution is to present a study and an analysis of existing works concerning the innovating Web service in human resources consultancy. It is a question of observing new related activities to management consultancy and human resources market: training consultancy, <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>competences,</b> staff consultancy, management consultancy, experience validation and accompaniment. In this study we have reports of certain great sites, by their notoriety due to a true indexing work and a good marketing policy, which succeed in monopolizing a great part of the market.

En este artículo se presenta un proyecto de coordinación de profesores de diferentes áreas de conocimiento, pero con las mismas inquietudes: cómo desarrollar y evaluar competencias genéricas en el aula. Para ello han realizado un trabajo común en sus materias organizando las distintas tareas en diferentes fases: se han seleccionado y definido las competencias genéricas a desarrollar, se han consensuado indicadores y realizado diversas rúbricas para la evaluación de las mismas y se han diseñado actividades formativas específicas en las cuales se ha implementado esta evaluación. Con el objetivo de implicar al alumnado se ha realizado autoevaluación y co-evaluación.   Además, para evaluar el impacto de este trabajo de coordinación se ha recogido la percepción tanto de los alumnos como de los docentes implicados ante las nuevas herramientas de evaluación diseñadas, mediante cuestionarios específicos y sesiones grupales de reflexión.   ABSTRACT University Teachers’ Coordination: a Key Factor for Competences Assessment. The <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> {{emerges as}} a key aspect {{if we want to}} be consistent with the new educational paradigm, particularly in the field of higher education. In that sense, {{in order to get a}} continuous improvement in the teaching practice, an effective coordination among teachers is a very useful mechanism. It can help to share problems, deal with different tasks and reach a consensus on assessment criteria. In this paper we present a project concerning the coordination of teachers from different subject areas. All the teachers in this group have the same concerns: how to develop and how to assess general competences in their lessons. To that end, collaborative work has been done in their subjects by organizing the different tasks in different phases: the key competences to be developed have been selected and defined, the indicators and rubrics for their assessment have been agreed upon, and specific training activities have been designed to implement the assessment tools. In order to involve the students in their learning process, self-assessment and peer-assessment has been carried out. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the impact of this coordination work, the students’ and the teachers’ perceptions of the new assessment tools designed have also be collected by means of several questionnaires especifically made and also by resorting to group reflection sessions. The regular meetings held by the participating teachers allowed us to check that the teachers’ coordination encourages reflection on our teaching duties and allows the exchange of experiences, thus increasing their motivation.    </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} make them more {{relevant}} to professional practice, a significant shift among Dutch Higher Vocational Education (HBO) programmes towards competence-based education and assessments has taken place. This research has been carried out to {{contribute to the development of}} the quality of competence-based assessments, especially in view of the predictive validity of first year assessments for second and third year internship assessments. First a comprehensive model of the concept of competence has been devised. The model exists of three interrelated dimensions (knowledge base, professional performance, developability) that form the heart of professional competences. In order to be able to assess a person’s competence evidence must be found relating to all three dimensions and how they are interrelated. Second a framework has been devised to determine the quality of competence-based assessments. In this framework three aspects are important: 1) what is being assessed, 2) how the assessing is done, and 3) what the purpose is of carrying out the assessment. These three aspects were used as the basis for devising an instrument. In a pilot research the quality of the instrument was tested and in a subsequent research a panel used the instrument to determine the quality profiles of seven competence-based assessments of the first year of the social work programmes of Hogeschool Utrecht. The research showed that it was possible to establish a quality profile for each of the assessments which illuminates the strong and weak points of the assessments. A third research study was focused on the quality of competence-based assessments of internships. This study made clear that according to the assessors the dimensions of competences are given equal consideration but that not all competences of the study programme are relevant to internships. The assessors tend to have a holistic style of assessment as their <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> is based on a general impression. Both the internship assessors and the students believe that the assessments contribute very strongly to the intern’s learning. Because the assessment of the internships is partly based on self-assessments a fourth research was executed at their quality. The outcomes demonstrated that self-assessments of third-year students appear to be more realistic than second-year students and that students who perform poorly in internships have a tendency to strongly overrate themselves in their self-assessments. The final study examined the predictive value of first year assessments for the assessment of the internships in the second and third year of social work education at Hogeschool Utrecht and the relation between the predictive validity of the first year assessments and their quality profiles. This research showed that there appeared to be a certain link between the marks for the first year assessments and those for the second-year internship but not for third-year internships. The previously determined quality profiles of the first year assessments revealed that assessments in the first year in which the capacity to develop and, in particular, reflection are assessed, can to a certain degree predict students’ competences as assessed in their second-year internships...|$|E

Although this may be accomplished by audit and performance data, detailed and robust <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> may be valuable in certain circumstances. OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a detailed <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> performance of colonoscopy. DESIGN: Evaluation of a Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) method developed by an expert group of colonoscopists and clinical educationalists. SETTING: English National Health Service National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Aspirant colonoscopists wishing to participate in the BCSP were assessed by using the DOPS. Reliability was estimated by using generalizability theory (G), and the candidates' and assessors' perspectives on validity were evaluated by questionnaire. INTERVENTIONS: Grading of performance by 2 assessors over 2 consecutive real cases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: DOPS grades, global expert evaluation, performance data, evaluation questionnaire scores. RESULTS: The assessment had high relative reliability: G = 0. 81. The DOPS grades correlated highly with a global expert assessment. The candidates and assessors believed that the DOPS was a valid <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence.</b> LIMITATIONS: Not guaranteed to assess therapeutic skills; evaluation questionnaire influenced by result <b>of</b> <b>assessment.</b> CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evaluation <b>of</b> a DOPS <b>assessment</b> on independent practitioners. It performs well, with good levels of reliability and validity, and is sufficient to be used in a high-stakes assessment. Similar approaches should be considered for <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> in other areas of clinical practice for relicensing or recredentialing...|$|R
