500|$|To {{promote the}} release of The Book of Atrus, the Millers {{embarked}} on an eleven-city book tour. The publicity stemming from the book and game surprised the Millers, who remained unaccustomed to their new-found fame. [...] "The excitement is in talking to people who've walked through our world," [...] Rand Miller said in an interview. [...] "But we're not used to signing books - we're <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> our element." ...|$|E
500|$|Susannah Schouweiler of Knight Arts wrote, [...] "at {{two hours}} and 45 minutes, plus a 20-minute intermission, [...] run time is an awfully long haul for the {{smallest}} circus-goers." [...] Critics have also commented on the occasional misstep in a performance; Rohan Preston noted in his review of Grimm that [...] "there are moments– just a few stand out– {{when you realize that}} these are students, after all, in a celebrated after-school program. You want them to succeed, even if they do not always." [...] Similarly, writing for BroadwayWorld, Elaina Lenertz stated, [...] "Sometimes their silks routines are <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sync and sometimes the show features dance routines from younger kids who are still mastering stunts. Despite this, the performance is very impressive." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark's {{departure}} {{was shown}} during a special real-time episode, {{which focused on}} a 30-minute timeframe. Executive producer Susan Bower revealed that the team wanted Mark [...] "to {{go out with a}} bang" [...] and commented that while the episode features about half a dozen people, it is mostly about Mark and Kate. The show's script producer, Emma Gordon, agreed that the real-time episode was [...] "the best way to do justice" [...] to the character and his exit. McGregor explained that while the producers were planning his character's exit, they took inspiration from the US drama 24. Gordon admitted to Tiffany Fox from The West Australian that the technique was a real challenge for Neighbours. She said [...] "It is a bit different and <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> our normal storytelling process but it gives such a sense of tension which is exactly the feeling we wanted to create. When you have half an hour to make a decision that will affect the rest of your life, every excruciating minute counts." ...|$|E

500|$|Schwartz {{wrote in}} August 1980 that [...] "...the pilot episode manages to stuff nearly every imaginable aspect of low life into its first hour: prostitution, panhandling, pickpocketing, hostage taking, drug {{addiction}} and, finally, {{the murder of}} two policemen." [...] William Beamon of The Evening Independent noted that the opening episode introduces the audience to {{a vast array of}} characters masterfully intertwined in the storyline in a way that gives the series a [...] "powerful start". A review in the Spartanburg Herald-Journal commented that public defender Davenport's role adds professional intrigue that heightens the provocative nature of their illicit romance. However, The Miami News Jicha speculates that the romance was contrived to make the police show enticing to audiences. Jicha notes that the attack upon the police depicts the uncertainty of the daily life in law enforcement, but that the introduction of Belker's persona shows the writers are <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> touch with reality. Buckley's review in The New York Times claimed the episode [...] "veers back and forth between comic situations that aren't funny, serious matters that aren't that convincing and a romance that is merely silly" [...] and stated that various lighting and acting techniques were unsuccessful. The Boston Globe Henry III wrote that [...] "The redeeming virtue is a visual style reminiscent of documentaries — hand-held camera, saturated color, deliberately ragged editing." [...] He also described the show as [...] "a wacky, black-comic and frequently scary portrait of life in a big city police station". Buckley claimed that the show attempts to present an entire force of police officers with foibles that make them unfit for duty. Henry describes the shooting of the officers as an [...] "appallingly realistic random shooting", but since they were not found for hours, he describes their survival and recovery in the next episode, [...] "Presidential Fever", as miraculous.|$|E
2500|$|When reaming a pre-bored straight-sided hole, {{the spoon}} bit is {{inserted}} into the hole and rotated in a clockwise direction with a carpenters' brace until the desired taper is achieved. When boring into solid wood, the bit should be started in the vertical position; after a [...] "dish" [...] has been created and the bit has begun to [...] "bite" [...] into the wood, the angle of boring can be changed by tilting the brace <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the vertical. Holes can be drilled precisely, cleanly and quickly in any wood, at any angle of incidence, with total control of direction {{and the ability to}} change that direction at will.|$|E
2500|$|After {{discovering}} Morgan and Ava's {{affair and}} losing her father, Kiki spirals {{out of control}} and turns to alcohol. Kiki finally hits [...] "rock bottom" [...] on Halloween she gets behind the wheel drunk—and causes a car accident. The actress relished in her portrayal of Kiki during the alcohol story. [...] "Drunk Kiki was great" [...] Erin enthused. Erin also credited the storyline with helping to sway viewer opinion about her character. She later said [...] "I was doing something <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the norm for me. It was actual acting." [...] Head writer Jean Passanante described Kiki as someone [...] "who is still growing up and struggling to figure out who she is, even as she moves forward." [...] Passanante continued, [...] "You can't go through what she went through [...] and not change." [...] In addition to Franco, his girlfriend and her former stepmother Nina Clay (Michelle Stafford) and Morgan rallying around her, Kiki holds down a steady job {{for the first time since}} her introduction. Kiki also works toward rebuilding a relationship with her mother. [...] "In a strange way, right now, Kiki has more support than she's had for quite a while." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rising or Posting: The rider {{makes an}} up-and-down {{movement}} each stride, {{rising out of}} the saddle for one beat and lowering (sits) for the second beat. When the rising trot is performed correctly, it is comfortable for the rider and easy on the horse. This is preferred for show jumping, hunt seat, eventing (the jumping phases), saddle seat, lower-level dressage, and most other English-type riding as well as endurance riding. Although this does not provide as much control as sitting, it frees the horse's back. In the rising trot, the rider allows the horse's movement to throw his or her seat <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the saddle. When coming back down, the seat touches down lightly rather than slamming down on the horse's back. [...] Except in saddle seat riding, rider's shoulders maintain a slight forward incline throughout the rising trot, instead of the upright, vertical position seen in sitting trot. The shoulders and lower legs remain in relatively the same position when the rider is both rising and sitting and the hands also stay in the same position as the rider rises and sits.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Bell ended {{a five-year}} {{relationship}} with former fiancé Kevin Mann. She later told Complex magazine that dating [...] "makes {{me want to}} vomit.

'I beg pardon,' {{said the}} captain, {{sheathing}} his weapon--'I was <b>a</b> little <b>bit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way, to be sure; but {{to know the}} provocation, a man must read my heart, and that I hardly dare to do myself. But the wretch is safe from me. Heaven has done its own vengeance on us both.' ...|$|R

In fact, some of the fellows in our company thought he was <b>a</b> little <b>bit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his mind at times.

[...] Even {{though there is no}} direct rapid transit, three MBTA bus lines (69, 83, 91) stop in the square, making it accessible by mass transit. Post-streetcar visitors still regularly frequent the area's restaurant and entertainment attractions.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 2 {{and a half}} stars <b>out</b> <b>of</b> four, calling it a [...] "a barbed, uncompromising attack on {{generally}} observed community standards". In The New York Times, Vincent Canby declared it [...] "the Ben Hur of sketch films, {{which is to say that}} it's <b>a</b> tiny <b>bit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> proportion", concluding it was amusing, but he wished it were consistently amusing. Variety staff assessed it as disgusting, ridiculous, tactless, but above all, amusing.|$|R

5000|$|Robbie Daw {{was divided}} with the song, writing: [...] "On one hand, the {{employment}} of these slang terms du jour seem <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> character for the Cali band. But then again, this album is exec-produced by Max Martin — so say hello to the new, (even more so) commercially-viable Maroon 5." [...] Fraser McAlpine from BBC Music wrote a more mixed review, commenting: [...] "One More Night's melody can’t go more than a bar or two without repeating - as if the band is worried it may forget itself - or getting stuck on a Morse code note for a while, just like a Rihanna song would." [...] Simon Price from The Independent stated that the song is [...] "a piece of electro-reggae that makes Ace of Base sound like Lee [...] "Scratch" [...] Perry.|$|R

Both Bill and Laurie chose to take their dogs up the easier ramp and neither Star nor Andrew would jump down via the zipline when encouraged to do so.
