25|$|The rule {{of strict}} {{liability}} famously {{laid down by}} Blackburn J., in Rylands v. Fletcher, proved to be rather ineffective {{with the passage of}} time to counter the dangerous use of one’s property or an industry that produced substances or wastes detrimental to public health. The pre-requirements essential for establishing a liability under the principle of strict liability viz., the non-natural use of land, use of <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>thing,</b> and the element of escape provided substantial loopholes to the enterprises to escape liability under the Rylands v. Fletcher rule. Moreover, the exceptions provided within the rule (and restated by the Supreme Court of India in MC Mehta v. Union of India) afford ample opportunity to the commercial enterprises to escape liability.|$|E
500|$|The Kid {{intentionally}} {{arrived late}} to the scheduled game for 8 o'clock. When the Kid finally arrived and met Howard, Howard {{said that he had}} heard a lot about him {{for a couple of years}} and that Yeller had told him how he was gutted by the Kid with a pair of fours. Yeller said, [...] "remember Kid, the night you cut me up with the two red fours?" [...] The Kid jocularly replied, [...] "I must have overplayed my hand." [...] Everyone laughed, but Howard sternly replied, [...] "that was <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>thing</b> to do." [...] The Kid answered, [...] "that depends on whom you're sitting with, Lancey." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} blind bombing in Flagpole led to Grandy {{deciding}} {{to use the}} blind radar technique again. Hubbard was less sure. In 52 practice drops with blind radar, the average error had been [...] as opposed to [...] with visual bombing. The problem for the aircrew was {{that they would be}} dropping a live hydrogen bomb—generally considered <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>thing</b> to do—with no means of verifying that their instruments were correct. Air Chief Marshal Sir Harry Broadhurst, the head of Bomber Command, wished O'Connor luck; his XD827 would make the drop, with Squadron Leader Tony Caillard in XD827, the grandstand aircraft. The aircraft took off at 07:15 on 11 September 1958. Once in the air, though, a fault developed in the ground radar transmitter. Grandy then authorised a visual drop. It was later confirmed that it was [...] from the target. [...] It was detonated at [...] at 08:49 with a yield of about , very close to the predicted yield of [...]|$|E

2500|$|When the {{president}} says that Senator Kerry is emboldening enemies {{and you say that}} we could get hit again if voters make the wrong choice in November, are you saying that it would be <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>thing</b> to have John Kerry as president? ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{locations}} where this {{could take place}} was Quintinshill, where there were passing loops for both lines. [...] If the Down (northbound) loop was occupied, as {{it was on the}} morning of the accident, then the northbound local train would be shunted over a trailing crossover onto the Up (southbound) main line. Although not a preferred method of operation, this was allowed by the rules and was not <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>thing</b> to do provided the proper precautions were taken. In the six months before the accident the 6.17am local train had been shunted at Quintinshill 21 times, and on four of these occasions it had been shunted onto the Up line.|$|E
2500|$|The next {{element of}} Rylands {{is that the}} thing be {{something}} [...] "likely to do mischief if it escapes". Before Transco plc v Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council this {{did not have to}} be a dangerous item (see below); the risk was instead in its behaviour if it escapes. In Rylands the [...] "thing" [...] was water. Other examples are fire, as in Jones v Festiniog Railway, gas, as in Batchellor v Tunbridge Wells Gas Co, fumes, as in West v Bristol Tramways Co, and electricity, as in Hillier v Air Ministry. The extent of the [...] "thing"'s accumulation can also be considered, as in Mason v Levy, where it was not just the type of thing kept but the sheer amount which created the danger. It is essential for a Rylands claim that there be an escape of <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>thing</b> [...] "from a place where the defendant has occupation of or control over land to a place which is outside his occupation or control". In Read v J Lyons & Co Ltd, an explosion in a munitions factory killed an inspector on the property. Rylands was held not to apply, because there was no escape. The dangerous thing that escapes does not always have to be the thing which was accumulated, but there must be a causal link. In Miles v Forest Rock Granite Co (Leicestershire) Ltd, explosives stored on the defendant's land led to the escape of rocks in a blast, and the defendant was found liable.|$|E
