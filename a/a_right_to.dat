The defendant {{does not have}} a right, conversely, to a bench trial without the consent of the prosecution. If the defendant is charged with crimes for which the authorized sentence exceeds six months, whether in state or federal court, the defendant has <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> a jury. Further, the defendant has <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> a trial by jury if the actual sentence exceeds six months and the charged crime has no maximum authorized sentence (e.g. contempt of court).|$|E

25|$|During {{a hearing}} in November 2004, Zicari's lawyer H. Louis Sirkin argued that the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> privacy, {{recently}} confirmed and strengthened in Lawrence v. Texas, gave individuals the constitutional <b>right</b> <b>to</b> view offending materials in private, <b>a</b> <b>right</b> which cannot be meaningfully exercised without <b>a</b> corresponding <b>right</b> of companies <b>to</b> distribute such materials. The prosecution countered that <b>an</b> individual's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> privacy is unrelated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> company's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> commercial distribution.|$|R

5|$|A {{defendant}} {{does not}} have <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> appointed counsel {{if he or she}} is not sentenced to actual imprisonment and could not have been sentenced for more than one year, even if that conviction is later used to enhance sentencing for another crime, or even if the revocation of probation may result in actual imprisonment. Nor does the defendant have the right to appointed counsel to raise frivolous arguments on direct appeal, or to raise any arguments on habeas or other collateral appeal, even if facing execution.|$|E
5|$|A {{defendant}} must {{be given}} an opportunity to retain counsel, even if not entitled to appointed counsel. Subject to considerations such as conflicts of interest, scheduling, counsel's authorization to practice law in the jurisdiction, and counsel's willingness to represent the defendant (whether pro bono or for a fee), criminal defendants have <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> be represented by counsel of their choice. The remedy for erroneous depravation of first choice counsel is automatic reversal.|$|E
50|$|Raw {{milk and}} herdshare advocates argue that {{individuals}} have <b>a</b> fundamental <b>right</b> <b>to</b> contract, {{or in the}} alternative, that individuals have <b>a</b> fundamental <b>right</b> <b>to</b> consume and grow the foods of their choice.

In contrast, Adrian has <b>a</b> positive <b>right</b> <b>to</b> x against Clay if and only if Clay is obliged to act upon Adrian in some way regarding x. A case in point, if Adrian has <b>a</b> negative <b>right</b> <b>to</b> life against Clay, then Clay is required to refrain from killing Adrian; while if Adrian has <b>a</b> positive <b>right</b> <b>to</b> life against Clay, then Clay is required to act as necessary to preserve the life of Adrian.|$|R

5|$|According to Christophe Jaffrelot, while Gandhi {{considered}} untouchability to {{be wrong}} and evil, he believed that caste or class are based neither on inequality nor on inferiority. Gandhi believed that individuals should freely intermarry whoever they want to, but no one should expect everyone to befriend them. Every individual regardless {{of his or her}} background, stated Gandhi, has <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> choose who they welcome into their home, who they befriend and who they spend time with.|$|E
5|$|But, the {{defendant}} {{does not have}} <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> a jury in stacked misdemeanor prosecutions, even if the cumulative authorized imprisonment exceeds six months, {{as long as the}} actual sentence does not.

5|$|IRS {{officers}} raided Bell's home on April 1, 1997. He {{was arrested}} in May of that year, and, in July, {{he pleaded guilty to}} charges of obstruction of IRS agents and the use of a false Social Security number (officials alleged that he had used four such numbers since 1984 in order to conceal his assets; Bell said that he did not believe anyone had <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> know his real Social Security number).|$|E
5|$|In February 1998, the Norwegian Ministry of Justice {{stated that}} the {{relatives}} did not have <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> occupational injury compensation from the Norwegian National Insurance. Because of the Svalbard Treaty, the archipelago is an economic free zone and Arktikugol is exempt from paying social insurance, so its employees did not have <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> Norwegian benefits. Had this been the case, widows would have received about NOK600,000 per worker. By 1998, {{a few of the}} relatives had accepted the US$20,000 compensation, while the rest of them were planning to sue both the airline's insurance company and Arktikugol. Among the issues in the case, which took place at Nord-Troms District Court, was whether the accident was to be considered a working accident, and thus result in injury compensation from the mining company. In November, it was decided that the Ukrainians needed to make a guarantee for NOK2.5 million to run the case, which they could not afford. They therefore had no alternative than to accept the proposal from the insurance company. In June 1999, the parties agreed on a settlement, where the compensation was not disclosed to the public. It was later disclosed that the settlement was about three times the initial offer from the insurance company. In 1999, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs established a scholarship to help children who lost a parent in the accident to take senior secondary and tertiary education.|$|E

5|$|Kenyon {{taught that}} Christ's {{substitutionary}} atonement secured for believers <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> divine healing. This was attained through positive, faith-filled speech; {{the spoken word}} of God allowed believers to appropriate the same spiritual power that God used to create the world and attain the provisions promised in Christ's death and resurrection. Prayer was understood to be a binding, legal act. Rather than asking, Kenyon taught believers to demand healing since they were already legally entitled to receive it.|$|E

Nevertheless, Dalmatian Croatia remained a semi-independent duchy between the two Empires, as they had <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> elect their own prince.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{challenges}} the central premise of our campaign finance law, namely that restrictions on giving and spending money constitute restrictions on speech {{and thus can}} only be justified by compelling governmental interests. This claim has become so embedded in constitutional doctrine that {{in the most recent}} Supreme Court case in this area, Citizens United v. FEC, the majority asserts it without discussion or argument. This claim is often defended on the grounds that money is important or necessary for speech. While money surely facilitates speech, money also facilitates the exercise of many other constitutional rights. By looking at these other rights, this Article notes that sometimes constitutional <b>rights</b> generate <b>a</b> penumbral <b>right</b> <b>to</b> spend money and sometimes they do not. Thus the fact that money facilitates the exercise of <b>a</b> <b>right</b> is insufficient <b>to</b> show that the <b>right</b> includes <b>a</b> penumbral <b>right</b> <b>to</b> give or spend money. The first contribution this Article makes is to identify this question: when do constitutional <b>rights</b> generate <b>a</b> penumbral <b>right</b> <b>to</b> spend money? The second contribution this Article makes is to provide an answer. When <b>a</b> <b>right</b> depends on <b>a</b> market good for its exercise, the <b>right</b> generates <b>a</b> penumbral <b>right</b> <b>to</b> give or spend money. When <b>a</b> <b>right</b> does not depend on a market good for its exercise, the right does not include <b>a</b> penumbral <b>right</b> <b>to</b> spend money. Using this account, this Article argues that the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> give and spend money in connection with elections need not be protected as speech under the First Amendment...|$|R

Welles, in dissent, agreed that Blacksmith could individually sue for trespass, but disagreed that the appraisal was a condition precedent; he would have reversed and granted a new trial, with costs. The Court of Appeals remanded back to the Supreme Court, after which a writ of error was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
