5|$|Larger boats {{entering}} Padstow {{were offered}} assistance, generally by pilots who would wait at Stepper Point when a ship signalled {{it would be}} entering. If a boat was foundering, salvors would step in and help. There were cases where salvors attempted to overstate the danger in court, so as to extort more money from the owners. This happened to the brig The Towan, which foundered in October 1843 but was not in significant danger. Although it did not need assistance, salvors interfered and attempted to claim a large <b>amount</b> <b>in</b> compensation from the owner.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{is found}} in trace <b>amount</b> <b>in</b> {{numerous}} plants, plankton, and invertebrates, at concentrations of 69 to 5,760 parts per billion (ppb). In vertebrates the concentration is slightly lower, and nearly all vertebrate tissue and body fluids contain lithium ranging from 21 to 763 ppb. Marine organisms tend to bioaccumulate lithium more than terrestrial organisms. Whether lithium has a physiological role {{in any of these}} organisms is unknown.|$|E

5|$|The first {{microscopic}} {{sample of}} 253Es sample weighing about 10 nanograms was prepared in 1961 at HFIR. A special magnetic balance {{was designed to}} estimate its weight. Larger batches were produced later starting from several kilograms of plutonium with the einsteinium yields (mostly 253Es) of 0.48 milligrams in 1967–1970, 3.2 milligrams in 1971–1973, followed by steady production of about 3 milligrams per year between 1974 and 1978. These quantities however refer to the integral <b>amount</b> <b>in</b> the target right after irradiation. Subsequent separation procedures reduced the amount of isotopically pure einsteinium roughly tenfold.|$|E
5|$|The major toxins {{involved}} in A.muscaria poisoning are muscimol (3-hydroxy-5-aminomethyl-1-isoxazole, an unsaturated cyclic hydroxamic acid) {{and the related}} amino acid ibotenic acid. Muscimol {{is the product of}} the decarboxylation (usually by drying) of ibotenic acid. Muscimol and ibotenic acid were discovered in the mid-20th century. Researchers in England, Japan, and Switzerland showed that the effects produced were due mainly to ibotenic acid and muscimol, not muscarine. These toxins are not distributed uniformly in the mushroom. Most are detected in the cap of the fruit, a moderate <b>amount</b> <b>in</b> the base, with the smallest <b>amount</b> <b>in</b> the stalk. Quite rapidly, between 20 and 90 minutes after ingestion, a substantial fraction of ibotenic acid is excreted unmetabolised in the urine of the consumer. Almost no muscimol is excreted when pure ibotenic acid is eaten, but muscimol is detectable in the urine after eating A.muscaria, which contains both ibotenic acid and muscimol.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} rock {{constituents}} of the crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important {{exceptions to this}} and their total <b>amount</b> <b>in</b> any rock is usually much less than 1%.

30|$|Based on the {{seasonal}} variation of IAA <b>amounts</b> found <b>in</b> pine trees [12, 13], the IAA <b>amounts</b> <b>in</b> sugi trees were assumed to vary seasonally, and data regarding {{the seasonal}} variation of IAA amounts may be important. However, {{in the present}} study, we focused on the IAA <b>amounts</b> present <b>in</b> September, because these IAA amounts represented the amounts present during latewood formation. Latewood contributes much more than earlywood to the mechanical properties of softwood. Therefore, we compared the September IAA <b>amounts</b> <b>in</b> juvenile trees to those in mature trees.|$|R

5|$|A person's {{history of}} taking {{paracetamol}} is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis. The {{most effective way}} to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug nomogram developed in 1975, called the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion. To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury. A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the <b>amount</b> <b>in</b> the system because paracetamol may still be {{in the process of being}} absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a serum level taken before 4hours is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|As {{business}} {{improved in}} 1904 the enterprise moved to larger premises in Pendleton, where an annual rent of £90 was payable. On 1 January 1906, this operation became a limited company, The Churchill Machine Tool Co, with an authorised share capital of £50,000, split as £20,000 in ordinary shares of £1 and £30,000 in £5 preference shares. To accomplish {{the transfer of}} manufacturing operations, Charles Churchill & Co sold the Pendleton business to the new company for £15,000, of which £7,500 was in cash and a similar <b>amount</b> <b>in</b> £1 ordinary shares. The directors were Charles Churchill, J W W Gabriel, Walter Chamberlain and C H Churchill. Herbert Chamberlain had died in 1904.|$|E
5|$|By early 2016, delays as {{a result}} of {{overcrowding}} were up to more than 20,000 every month, four times the <b>amount</b> <b>in</b> 2012. The overcrowded trains have resulted in an increase of assaults because of tense commuters. With less platform space, more passengers are forced to be {{on the edge of the}} platform resulting in the increased possibility of passengers falling on the track. One possible solution that the MTA is considering is platform screen doors, which exist on the AirTrain JFK to prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. In order to prevent hitting passengers who could fall onto the tracks, train operators are being instructed to go into stations at lower speeds. The increased proximity of riders could result in the spread of contagious diseases.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} Zn and Mg amounts on the {{solidification}} characteristics, microstructure, thermal conductivity and tensile strength of Al-Zn-Mg-Fe alloys were investigated {{for the development}} of high thermal conductivity aluminium alloys for die casting. Zn and Mg <b>amounts</b> <b>in</b> Al-Zn-Mg-Fe alloys had a little effect on the liquidus / solidus temperature, the latent heat for solidification and the fluidity of Al-Zn-Mg-Fe alloys.
