5|$|As older {{generation}} of Waffen-SS scribes has died off, a new, post-war cadre of writers has {{done much to}} perpetuate {{the image of the}} force as a revolutionary European army.

5|$|After the shootout in Tombstone, {{his pursuit}} {{and murder of}} those who {{attacked}} his brothers, and after leaving Arizona, Wyatt was often the target of negative newspaper stories that disparaged his and his brothers' reputation. His role in history has stimulated considerable ongoing scholarly and editorial debate. A large body of literature {{has been written about}} Wyatt Earp and his legacy, some of it highly fictionalized. Considerable portions of it are either full of <b>admiration</b> <b>and</b> flattery or hostile debunking.|$|E

5|$|An often {{overlooked}} influence upon Benchley's early professional career was the <b>admiration</b> <b>and</b> friendship of the Canadian economist, academic, and humorist Dr. Stephen Leacock. From Toronto Leacock closely followed the increasing body of Benchley's published humor and wit, and opened correspondence between them. He admitted to occasional borrowing of a Benchley topic {{for his own}} reflection and writings. Eventually, he began lobbying gently for Benchley to compile his columns into book form, and in 1922 was delighted with {{the result of his}} nagging. For his part – in a tribute to Leacock – Benchley later said he wrote everything Leacock ever wrote. They had a marvelous friendship.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon, who {{had been}} well {{respected}} in Egypt and had earned himself the nickname Sultan el-Kebir (the Great Sultan) among the people of Cairo, lost their <b>admiration</b> <b>and</b> was no longer so addressed. In March 1800, French General Jean Baptiste Kléber was assassinated by Suleiman al-Halabi, a student at al-Azhar. Following the assassination, Napoleon ordered {{the closing of the}} mosque; the doors remained bolted until Ottoman and British assistance arrived in August 1801.|$|E
5|$|Pedro II may be {{considered}} a rare instance of a head of state who, despite being overwhelmingly beloved by his people, despite international <b>admiration</b> <b>and</b> acclamation, despite having been instrumental in driving forward major liberal social and economic reforms, despite overseeing a period of outstanding prosperity and influence during a reign covering nearly six decades, and despite being considered a highly successful ruler to the end, was ultimately subjected to overthrow and exile. The republican revolution which replaced the Empire led to decades of disruption and dictatorship.|$|E

He assures her of his <b>admiration,</b> briefly <b>and</b> in highly conventional terms, then returns to the subject that really interests him: her fortune. Leapor ironically exposes {{the reality of the}} marriage market and how women are reduced to their financial worth, despite the veneer of sentiment.|$|R

5|$|In 1469 John Spencer's uncle – {{also named}} John Spencer – had become feoffee (feudal lord) of Wormleighton in Warwickshire and a tenant at Althorp in Northamptonshire in 1486. The family's {{administration}} of their Northamptonshire and Warwickshire estates gained them <b>admiration</b> <b>and</b> a following throughout England, and their sheep-rearing business earned large profits. After beginning construction of Wormleighton Manor {{the previous year}} with some 60 relatives, John Spencer bought Althorp in 1508 for £800 from the Catesby family. At the time Spencer was also lord of the manors of Fenny Compton, Stoneton, Nobottle, Great Brington, Little Brington, Harlestone, Glassthorpe, Flore, Wicken, Wyke Hamon, Upper Boddington, Lower Boddington and Hinton, and owned numerous other properties. The park took some four years to establish, with 300 acres of grassland, 100 acres of woodland and 40 acres of water.|$|E

They develop a friendship in which both Nell and Brooke hold secret <b>admiration</b> <b>and</b> love for the other, but are unable to express it because of social conventions. Brooke also desires to lose his virginity because he feels that being a virgin is disgraceful. Because he cannot convince Nell or any of several other women to succumb to his wooing, he loses it in a homosexual encounter with a boyhood friend, Denham Russell-Smith.|$|E

De La Vega scolds Alejandro, claiming that Zorro was a servant of the people, not a thief and adventurer. He challenges Alejandro to gain Montero's trust instead. Alejandro poses as a visiting nobleman named Don Alejandro del Castillo y García, with De La Vega as his servant, and attends a party at Montero's hacienda. At the party he gains Elena's <b>admiration</b> <b>and</b> enough of Montero's trust {{to be invited to}} a secret meeting where several other noblemen are present. Montero hints at a plan to retake California for the Dons by buying it from General Santa Anna, who needs money to fund his upcoming war with the United States.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{economic}} success allowed Busch to visit Wiedensahl more frequently. Busch {{had decided to}} leave Munich, as only few relatives lived there, and the artists' association was temporarily disbanded. In June 1867 Busch met his brother Otto for the first time, in Frankfurt. Otto {{was working as a}} tutor to the family of a wealthy banker and industrialist, Kessler. Busch became friends with Kessler's wife, Johanna, a mother of seven and an influential art and music patron of Frankfurt. She regularly opened salons at her villa, frequented by artists, musicians and philosophers. She believed Busch to be a great painter, a view supported by Anton Burger, a leading painter of the Kronberger Malerkolonie, the Kronberg-based group of painters. While his humorous drawings did not appeal to her, she supported his painting career. At first she established an apartment and studio for Busch in her villa, later providing him with an apartment nearby. Motivated by Kessler's support and <b>admiration,</b> <b>and</b> introduction to the cultural life of Frankfurt, the 'Frankfurter Years' were the most artistically productive for Busch. At this time he and Otto discovered the philosophical works of Arthur Schopenhauer.|$|E
5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites <b>admiration</b> <b>and</b> to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E

60|$|Of Coleridge {{there was}} little said. Coleridge was now dead, not long since; nor was his name {{henceforth}} much heard in Sterling's circle; though on occasion, {{for a year or}} two to come, he would still assert his transcendent admiration, especially if Maurice were by to help. But he was getting into German, into various inquiries and sources of knowledge new to him, <b>and</b> his <b>admirations</b> <b>and</b> notions on many things were silently and rapidly modifying themselves.|$|R
