40|$|In July 2011, a 46 year-old male {{equipment}} operator (victim) {{working for}} a trenchless utility installation contractor suffered fatal crushing injuries when a horizontal auger boring (HAB) machine overturned. At {{the time of the}} incident, the victim was installing three steel pipe casings using a trenchless method called pipe ramming at a municipal water project site. Each casing was 36 in (0. 9 m) in diameter and 40 ft. (12 m) long. The casings were driven horizontally through the ground by a pneumatic ramming hammer. On the day of the incident, the victim was operating an HAB machine to bore inside the casings to remove earth material that filled the casings during installation. The machine was mounted on <b>a</b> <b>track</b> <b>assembly</b> and the track assembly was not anchored to the ground. The weight of the machine and the track assembly was 15, 800 lbs. (7, 167 kg). The victim was operating the machine at the operator’s platform located {{on the left side of}} the machine (when facing the casing). The incident occurred shortly after 10 : 00 am when the auger string had advanced approximately 11 ft. (3. 4 m) into the casing. The HAB machine along with the track assembly suddenly pitched to the left roughly 90 degrees counterclockwise (Photo 1). Unable to jump free, the victim was pinned by the machine against the ground before the machine swung back to the upright position. Immediately the machine pitched to the left a second time, crushing the victim, and swun...|$|E
40|$|This Masters Thesis {{has been}} {{performed}} at Futuris Automotive in Adelaide, Australia. Futuris Automotive designs and manufactures automotive interior solutions. The {{purpose of this}} project {{is to make a}} recommendation to Futuris Automotive of how the tracks should be assembled at the plant in Edinburgh Park. The track is the steel frame that the front seat cushion rests on and that allows the seat to go back and forth. The aim of the project is to design <b>a</b> <b>Track</b> <b>Assembly</b> area with high labour efficiency, minimum storages and without need of forklifts. The work environment must be safe and ergonomic. The current way of assembling tracks at the plant in Edinburgh Park requires large storages because of the batch building manufacturing principle. This leads to high stockholding costs and long lead times and requires a lot of floor space. The production does not run in a smooth continuos flow because of all the out-of-cycle work that the operators need to do, including running three different sub-assembly stations and change over material racks. The result of the project is that the tracks should be produced in sequence, in the same order that they are used. This solution gives the smallest buffers, shortest lead times and needs no additional equipment. It requires little floor space and allows for good material handling. The weaknesses of the solution, quality and reliability, are handled with quality assurances and a buffer of finished tracks. No forklift is needed, the material is transported with tuggers from the Distribution Centre in sequence. The floor space needed is decreased with 250 square metres compared to the present situation. 1. 5 operator less is needed per shift, the stockholding cost is reduced with 22, 500 Australian dollars yearly and the lead time through the system is lowered from todays 18 - 45 hours, depending on track type, to about six hours. A trial of producing tracks in sequence was conducted which did not show any unexpected problems with the solution and we recommend Futuris to do further trials to ensure that the line balancing is reasonable and practical and that the cycle time is matching the takt time before deciding upon implementing it.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{study results}} of the nonlinear interaction processes between the supporting surface of the <b>track</b> <b>Assembly</b> and {{the ground in the}} contact patch, using the mathematical models of friction. For the case blaskapelle motion of a caterpillar, when the resultant of the elementary friction forces is limited by the coupling due to the sliding tracks on the ground, it appears that the increase of the lateral component leads to a decrease of the longitudinal component and the change of direction of the resulting force. As a result, with increasing angular velocity of the <b>tracked</b> vehicle <b>a</b> longitudinal component of the friction force decreases, which is the geometric factor and is defined by the locus of friction for a given type of soil. In the development of this well-known model is considered the general case of friction, which describes the effect of reducing the coefficient of friction in the contact patch at increasing the angular velocity of rotation. To describe this process is used the model of the combined friction which occurs when the surface of the body is doing {{at the same time the}} rotational and translational motion. The resulting expression for the resultant of forces of friction and the moment of resistance to rotation based on the decomposition of the first order Pade for <b>a</b> flat spot <b>track</b> <b>Assembly</b> with ground of rectangular shape. With combined friction any arbitrarily small perturbation force acting parallel to the surface of the contact spot, leads to slip. The paper considers the possibility of using the model of the combined friction to research a sustainability curvilinear motion of tracked vehicles. The proposed motion of the machine in the mode of skidding on the basis of the frictionslip. The interpretation of the physical processes occurring in the contact area, on the basis of the theory of the combined friction would allow using this mathematical model in the algorithm structure of automatic traffic control for solving the problem of controllability of partial lateral drift that will further improve the mobility and maneuverable quality of tracked vehicles...|$|R

40|$|The {{deterioration}} of <b>a</b> rail <b>track</b> due to large dynamic wheel loads is inevitable {{over the years}} and leads to frequent, high-cost maintenance. This problem is more critical in isolated rail track locations such as bridges and tunnels, where the substructure is much stiffer than the surface <b>track</b> <b>assembly.</b> One measure used to minimize track deterioration is geosynthetic inclusions such as rubber mats under the layer of ballast. In this study, cyclic loads from fast and heavy-haul trains were simulated on stiffer track foundation conditions using a largescale process simulation triaxial (prismoidal) apparatus (PSPTA) to investigate the performance of ballast improved by rubber mats locally manufactured from recycled tires. The laboratory results indicate that the energy-absorbing (damping) characteristics of rubber mats reduce the amount of deformation and degradation of ballast under stiffer track conditions. The study shows that rubber mats distribute the stress applied from moving trains more uniformly by increasing the effective contact area, which then reduces the dynamic amplification of applied vertical stress and leads to much less ballast degradation...|$|R
