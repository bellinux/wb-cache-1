500|$|By 1966, Barrett Strong, {{the singer}} on Motown Records' {{breakthrough}} hit, [...] "Money (That's What I Want)", had {{the basics of}} a song he had started to write in Chicago, where the idea {{had come to him}} while walking down Michigan Avenue that people were <b>always</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "I heard it through the grapevine". The phrase is associated with black slaves during the Civil War, who had their form of telegraph: the human grapevine. Producer Norman Whitfield worked with Strong on the song, adding lyrics to Strong's basic Ray Charles influenced gospel tune and the single chorus line of [...] "I heard it through the grapevine". This was to be the first of a number of successful collaborations between Strong and Whitfield.|$|E

[...] In the words of biographer Barry Miles, [...] "Lennon simply shredded his vocal cords {{in the interests of}} rock 'n' roll." [...] The Beatles' producer, George Martin, tells how Lennon [...] "had an inborn dislike of his own voice which I could never understand.

Lupton compares The Heart of a Woman with other autobiographies, and states {{that for the first}} time in Angelou's series, she is able to present herself as a model for successful living. However, Angelou's [...] "woman's heart"—her perspective as a woman with concerns about her self-esteem and the conflicts with her lovers and her son—is what makes her autobiography different. Angelou's feelings as described in The Heart of a Woman, which Lupton calls Angelou's [...] "most introspective" [...] book, are what dictates the book's form.|$|E

[...] Angelou recognized that there were fictional aspects to all her books; she tended to [...] "diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth". Her approach paralleled the conventions of many African-American autobiographies written during the abolitionist period in the US, when truth was often censored for purposes of self-protection. [...] Author Lyman B. Hagen has placed Angelou in the long tradition of African-American autobiography, but insisted that she has created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form.|$|E

[...] According to Verducci, during one off-season, Henderson called Padres general manager Kevin Towers and left this message: [...] "Kevin, this is Rickey. Calling on behalf of Rickey. Rickey wants to play baseball." [...] However, Henderson denied that this happened in a February 26, 2009 interview on Mike and Mike in the Morning. In 2003, he discussed his unusual phraseology, saying, [...] "People are <b>always</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Rickey says Rickey.' But it's been blown way out of proportion. Rickey says it when Rickey doesn't do what Rickey needs to be doing. Rickey uses it to remind himself, like, `Rickey, what you doing, you stupid....' Rickey's just scolding himself." [...] Henderson did use the first person pronoun on occasion, such as when he defended his position during a contract dispute: [...] "All I'm asking for is what I want." ...|$|E

[...] When speaking of her unique use of the genre, Angelou acknowledges that she follows the slave narrative tradition of [...] "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, <b>always</b> <b>saying</b> I meaning 'we'". [...] McPherson states that Angelou {{is a master of}} this autobiographical form, especially the [...] "confrontation of the Black self within a society that threatens to destroy it", but departs from it in Traveling Shoes by taking the action to Africa. [...] Lupton, referring to the journey motif in the book, insists that its narrative point of view is [...] "again sustained through the first-person autobiographer in motion".|$|E
500|$|At first, Angelou {{intended}} {{to return to}} poetry and play-writing after completing Caged Bird and write no more autobiographies, but she chose the genre as her primary mode of expression because of its challenge and {{so that she could}} [...] "change it, to make it bigger, richer, finer, and more inclusive in the twentieth century". In a 1989 interview, she stated, [...] "I think I am the only serious writer who has chosen the autobiographical form to carry my work, my expression". [...] As she told journalist George Plimpton during a 1990 interview, [...] "Autobiography is awfully seductive; it’s wonderful". [...] She also told Plimpton that like the tradition begun by Frederick Douglass in slave narratives, she used the literary technique of [...] "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, <b>always</b> <b>saying</b> I meaning 'we'". [...] As critic Susan Gilbert states, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's. [...] Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe agrees, and sees Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people.|$|E
500|$|According to African-American {{literature}} scholar Pierre A. Walker, {{the challenge}} {{for much of the}} history of African-American literature was that its authors have had to confirm its status as literature before they could accomplish their political goals, which was why Angelou's editor Robert Loomis was able to dare her into writing Caged Bird by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered [...] "high art". [...] Angelou acknowledged that she followed the slave narrative tradition of [...] "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, <b>always</b> <b>saying</b> I meaning 'we'". [...] Scholar John McWhorter calls Angelou's books [...] "tracts" [...] that defend African-American culture and fight negative stereotypes. [...] According to McWhorter, Angelou structured her books, which to him seem to be written more for children than for adults, to support her defense of black culture. [...] McWhorter sees Angelou as she depicts herself in her autobiographies [...] "as a kind of stand-in figure for the black American in Troubled Times". [...] McWhorter views Angelou's works as dated, but recognizes that [...] "she has helped {{to pave the way for}} contemporary black writers who are able to enjoy the luxury of being merely individuals, no longer representatives of the race, only themselves". [...] Scholar Lynn Z. Bloom compares Angelou's works to the writings of Frederick Douglass, stating that both fulfilled the same purpose: to describe black culture and to interpret it for their wider, white audiences.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, Hasta la Raíz {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. Beverly Bryan of The Village Voice {{stated that the}} album [...] "casts a spell with deep feeling, and melodies and lyrics that linger in the mind. Elegantly adorned with subtle strings and velvety production, it {{has the kind of}} warmth people are <b>always</b> <b>saying</b> they can hear on old vinyl records". Bryan also predicted that this release would be recognized in the future as the singer's [...] "most profound and enduring statement". In another positive review, Natalia Cano of the magazine Rolling Stone Mexico, referred to the album as [...] "fresh and honest pop, a reflection of her musical maturity", reiterating that the album [...] "continues to place her {{as one of the most}} important composer and performer of Latin America." [...] AllMusic's Mariano Prunes gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars ranking, and on his review stated that [...] "these are extremely well-written songs in the spirit of the great Latin America romantic tradition of which Lara was a founding father, but infused with a contemporary perspective". Luis Romero of the website Coffee and Saturday said that the album is one of the best pop releases of the year, praising Lafourcade's evolution as a musician, but was critical of Lafourcade for not having extended [...] "her comfort zone", since it is too early in her career to become settled in one type of music, [...] "and the proof is that the best album tracks are those where she is helped by Leonel García, Torreblanca and María Daniela". An editor from Televisa Espectáculos wrote a mixed review, commenting that the album has to be listened to twice to [...] "fall in love with at least one song", comparing positively the title track with Lafourcade's work on her previous album (Mujer Divina) and the songs [...] "Mi Lugar Favorito" [...] and [...] "Te Quiero Ver" [...] with her album Hu Hu Hu, creating a [...] "mix of sounds" [...] on which Lafourcade shows all the things she learned after working with Agustín Lara's catalog. Lissette Corsa, of MTVIggy, stated that [...] "despite moments of darkness and heartfelt sadness, Hasta la Raiz bristles with a sense of adventure and optimism", and noted the influence of Chilean songwriter Violeta Parra in the track [...] "Vámonos Negrito", as part of Lafourcade's [...] "eclectic artistry". Corsa also noted that the singer [...] "drew from Joni Mitchell, Charles Bradley, and Amy Winehouse".|$|E

[...] Their hesitancy and self-qualification arise as they meet obstacles, readjust and pass on. If life is bountiful in New England, it is also evasive and easily missed. In the stories Updike tells, marriages and homes are made only to be broken. His descriptiveness embodies a promiscuous love for everything in the world.
