5|$|I {{certainly}} don't see gay {{and lesbian}} history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that it <b>all</b> <b>started</b> <b>with</b> Stonewall.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{has seen}} a huge {{increase}} in the wildlife refuge system. It <b>all</b> <b>started</b> <b>with</b> Pelican Island and now is 96 million acres (390,000km²) including 545 individual refuges, 75 wildernesses, and 1,000miles (1,600km) of wild and scenic river, all overseen by USFWS. But {{with all of these}} additions, the budgets did not see a similar rise to match the refuge growth.|$|E
25|$|Tanaka {{initially}} planned out 50 songs, {{but this}} was far too many to record and fit into the game within allotted time and budget estimates, so the number was cut down to 24. The number was further cut down toe seven, but Hiroi was brought close to tears by this. Faced with this issue, Tanaka asked how much music the team could manage, {{and was told that}} one CD's worth of content was enough. Tanaka eventually settled on between eleven and twelve songs which made it into the final game. The lyrics of all the songs were written by Hiroi, despite his repeated protests about not being a professional lyricist. Due to Hiroi's self-professed inexperience, Tanaka ended up being a teacher figure for him. As part of his training, Hiroi went to karaoke sessions, studied the work of famous songwriter Yū Aku, and bought old records of vintage songs. The learning process took between one and two months before Hiroi was competent at writing song lyrics. The songs of Sakura Wars <b>all</b> <b>started</b> <b>with</b> Hiroi creating the lyrics and then handing his work to Tanaka for polishing and to be set to music.|$|E

James Berry, monitor engineer for Bruno Mars, remembered [...] "When I took on the Bruno Mars gig over two to half a year ago (The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour), he and the background singers were using a competitor's model. I just {{knew there was a}} better microphone and capsule combination for him". Over the time, every vocalist on the band changed the microphones they used, it <b>all</b> <b>started</b> <b>with</b> the background singers, followed by [...] "the front-of-house guy" [...] and finally Bruno Mars.

500|$|Business {{continued}} to be successful during the late 1990s as other independent bookstores fell by the wayside and companies like Barnes & Noble expanded. Cohen and Meade decided to sell the store to Danny Gainsburg, who was selling his T-shirt business so {{he would be able}} to afford the cost of the store. The co-owners made an agreement with Gainsburg that he would gain control of the store if he was able to function amicably with the rest of the staff. Cohen and Meade set him up in a part-time position to see how he would interact with the employees and sold him an equity stake in the business without informing the other staff members. Gainsburg was pressured to leave by the staff after he kissed an employee on her birthday. The three co-owners agreed that Gainsburg should resign, and Gainsburg received back his initial investment plus a premium. Gainsburg said to the Wall Street Journal, [...] "We <b>all</b> <b>started</b> <b>with</b> good motives, but there was lots of naiveté on all sides." [...] In 2006, a year after the botched sale attempt, Cohen and Meade both decided to hold onto the store as sole co-owners for at least three to five more years and met with an outside consultant to devise an eventual exit strategy.|$|E

2500|$|The band Jones & Giftet (Jones & the Poison) {{was formed}} with members Joakim [...] "Jocke" [...] Berg, Martin Sköld, Markus Mustonen, Sami Sirviö and Thomas Bergqvist (synthesizers). It <b>all</b> <b>started</b> <b>with</b> Berg going to London and buying two guitars, one for Sirviö {{and one for}} himself. Sirviö and Berg had a band that rehearsed at Bålsta Musikslott which {{consisted}} of three people. Inspired by My Bloody Valentine, Sköld and Berg decided {{they were going to}} start a new band. This happened at the school S:t Eskils cafeteria Grönan. Berg and Sköld met up with a very drunk Mustonen outside of the Restaurant Vildsvinet in Eskilstuna. Whilst drunk, he promised to join the band and play the drums. Thomas Bergqvist, a friend of Martin Sköld, was invited to come along and play the synth. The first gig was played in [...] Lindesberg in Västmanland, and the second at Knegoffs in Eskilstuna.|$|E
2500|$|Significant {{differences}} {{in the construction of}} the Sutton Hoo and Scandinavian helmets belie significant similarities in their designs. The Scandinavian helmets that are capable of restoration were constructed more simply than the Sutton Hoo helmet. None has a face mask, solid neck guard, or cap made from one piece of metal, and only two have distinct cheek guards. The neck guards [...] "seem without exception to have [...] either iron strips or protective mail curtains." [...] The helmets from Ultuna, Vendel 14 and Valsgärde 5 all used iron strips as neck protection; five strips hung from the rear of the Vendel 14 and Valsgärde 5 brow bands, and though only two strips survive from the Ultuna helmet, others would have hung alongside them. Camail was used on the remaining helmets, from Valsgärde 6, 7 and 8, and from Vendel 1 and 12. Fragmentary remains from Vendel 10 and 11, and from Solberga, likewise suggest camail. In terms of cheek protection, only two helmets had something other than continuations of the camail or iron strips used to protect the neck. The Vendel 14 helmet had cheek guards, but of [...] "a differing version well forward on the face" [...] of those on the Sutton Hoo helmet. Though [...] "difficult to reconstruct," [...] fragments from the Broa helmet suggest a configuration similar to those on the Vendel 14 helmet. Finally, the widely varying caps on each Scandinavian helmet all share one feature: None is similar to the cap on the Sutton Hoo helmet. The basic form of the helmets from Vendel, Valsgärde, Ultuna and Broa <b>all</b> <b>started</b> <b>with</b> a brow band and nose-to-nape band. The Ultuna helmet had its sides filled in with latticed iron strips, while each side on the Valsgärde 8 helmet was filled in with six parallel strips running from the brow band to the nose-to-nape brand. The remaining four helmets—excepting those from Vendel 1 and 10, and Broa, which are too fragmentary to determine their exact construction—all employed two lateral bands and sectional infills. The Vendel 14 helmet had eight infill plates, one rectangular and one triangular per quadrant; that from Valsgärde 7 helmet used four infill plates, one for each quadrant; the one from Valsgärde 6 also used identical infills for each quadrant, but with [...] "elaborate" [...] Y-shaped iron strips creating a latticed effect; and the Valsgärde 5 example filled in the back two quadrants with latticed iron strips, and the front two quadrants each with a rectangular section of lattice work and a triangular plate.|$|E
