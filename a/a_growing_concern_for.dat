5|$|One {{reason for}} the change of {{strategy}} towards Scotland was <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> the relationship between England and France. As long as Scotland and France were in an alliance, the English were {{faced with the prospect}} of fighting a war on two fronts. The French carried out raids on English coastal towns, leading to rumours in England of a full-scale French invasion. In 1337, Philip VI confiscated the English king's Duchy of Aquitaine and the county of Ponthieu. Instead of seeking a peaceful resolution to the conflict by paying homage to the French king, as his father had done, Edward responded by laying claim to the French crown as the grandson of Philip IV. The French rejected this based on the precedents for agnatic succession set in 1316 and 1322. Instead, they upheld the rights of PhilipIV's nephew, King Philip VI (an agnatic descendant of the House of France), thereby setting the stage for the Hundred Years' War (see family tree below). In the early stages of the war, Edward's strategy was to build alliances with other Continental princes. In 1338, LouisIV named Edward vicar-general of the Holy Roman Empire and promised his support. As late as 1373, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 established an Anglo-Portuguese Alliance. These measures produced few results; the only major military victory in this phase of the war was the English naval victory at Sluys on 24 June 1340, which secured English control of the Channel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Negative bias {{temperature}} instability (NBTI), which reduces {{the lifetime of}} PMOS transistors, is becoming <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> reliability <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> sub-micrometer CMOS technologies. Parametric variation introduced by nano-scale device fabrication inaccuracy can exacerbate the PMOS transistor wear-out problem and further reduce the reliable lifetime of microprocessors. In this work, we propose microarchitecture design techniques to combat the combined effect of NBTI and process variation (PV) on the reliability of high-performance microprocessors. Experimental evaluation shows our proposed process variation aware (PV-aware) NBTI tolerant microarchitecture design techniques can considerably improve the lifetime of reliability operation while achieving an attractive trade-off with performance and power. ...|$|R
