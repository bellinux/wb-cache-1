5|$|We {{shot the}} clip in mid-October {{on a cold}} day in New York City. The vibe and feeling was great... It was the first video for the album, so {{obviously}} everyone was excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna and I spoke in depth about creating a piece that was gritty, raw {{and more of a}} street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made without a lot of resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build and manipulate environments as we {{have done in the past}}... I wanted to try and take everything we have done in the past <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the side.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{conditions}} were deteriorating on Königsberg. There were shortages of coal, ammunition, food, and medical supplies. Although {{safe from the}} British, the crew was ravaged by malaria and other tropical ailments. Generally {{cut off from the}} outside world, the morale of the sailors fell. However, the situation was marginally improved with a scheme to resupply the ship and give her a fighting chance to return home. A captured British merchant ship, Rubens, was renamed Kronborg. It was given a Danish flag, papers, and a crew of German sailors selected for their ability to speak Danish. It was then packed with coal, field guns, ammunition, small arms, and various supplies. As the freighter approached East Africa, Königsberg prepared to sortie to meet the ship and attempt to break out and return to Germany. Instead, Königsberg was trapped in the river by two cruisers and several smaller vessels. Hyacinth intercepted Kronborg as she approached, and chased her to Manza Bay. The trapped ship was forced aground and set on fire, but the Germans salvaged much of her cargo <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> use later in the East Africa Campaign.|$|E
25|$|In many {{industrial}} processes there is waste of energy or a heat stream {{that is being}} exhausted, heat exchangers {{can be used to}} recover this heat <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> use by heating a different stream in the process. This practice saves {{a lot of money in}} industry, as the heat supplied to other streams from the heat exchangers would otherwise come from an external source that is more expensive and more harmful to the environment.|$|E

25|$|Hostilities {{between the}} Anglo-Saxons and the Welsh {{came to a}} head with the Battle of Hereford in 760, in which the Britons freed {{themselves}} from the influence of the English. Hereford was again targeted by the Welsh during their conflict with the Anglo-Saxon King Edward the Confessor in AD 1056 when, supported by Viking allies, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, King of Gwynedd and Powys, marched on the town <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the torch before returning home in triumph. Hereford had the only mint west of the Severn in the reign of Athelstan (924–39), and it was to Hereford, then a border town, that Athelstan summoned the leading Welsh princes.|$|E
25|$|On September 2, 2013, South Korea's National Assembly {{received}} the government's arrest motion for lawmaker Lee Seok-ki, signed by President Park Geun-hye. According to the Korean National Assembly Act, the arrest motion should {{be decided by}} vote in the plenary session 24 hours after and within 72 hours from {{the report of the}} motion. Kang Chang-hee, the speaker of the National Assembly, submitted the proposal of opening plenary session from September 2 to December 10 <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a vote, which was the preliminary procedure to pass the arrest motion. The proposal was passed with 255 in favor, 2 against, and 7 abstentions. Kim Mi-hee and Kim Jae-yeon from the UPP opposed the proposal. Seven abstainers, all of whom were from the opposition Democratic Party, were Moon Jae-in, Lee In-young, Kim Yong-ik, Do Jong-hwan, Yu Sung-yeop, Eun Soo-mi, and Lim Soo-kyung. Lee Seok-ki didn't participate in the vote at all.|$|E
500|$|... "Unfaithful" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from most music critics. Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times described [...] "Unfaithful" [...] as [...] "a profoundly ludicrous – but not disagreeable – pop lament". Quentin B. Huff from PopMatters [...] commented that, [...] "Unfaithful' is a well-intentioned ballad informed by dramatic piano and strings". Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani stated, [...] "The melodramatic, string-laden ballad 'Unfaithful' is, if nothing else, an ambitious second single {{for an artist}} like Rihanna, and with lyrics like 'I don't {{want to be a}} murderer/Our love, his trust/I might as well take a gun <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his head,' it earns bonus points just for being so fucking weird".|$|E

500|$|Constructing his designs proved {{far more}} {{difficult}} than Evans initially envisaged—with just six working steam engines in the United States at this time, {{and a handful of}} workshops with any experience making them, it took Evans much of his savings and two years to yield a working example to display to the public in 1803. This first engine was powered by a double-acting cylinder six inches in diameter and with a piston stroke length of eighteen inches. Many components, such as the flywheel and crosshead, were made of wood in order to simplify construction. The boiler, the engineering of which was critical to the safe operation of the engine, consisted of a large copper shell encased in wood and cast iron rings in order to contain the pressure. The output of the machine was approximately five horsepower. This work output was modest by contemporary standards—the low-pressure engine of the nearby waterworks produced about twelve horsepower. But his steam engine was just a fraction of the size of pre-existing machines—the waterworks machine was over twenty-five times larger in volume. Evans unveiled his engine at his store <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> work crushing plaster of Paris and, more sensationally, sawing slabs of marble. The showmanship paid off, and thousands came to see the machine in operation, while the Philadelphia newspaper Aurora declared [...] "a new era {{in the history of the}} steam engine." ...|$|E
2500|$|More {{recently}} a live folk music tradition has {{developed in the}} town. The Buffet Bar Folk Club meets every Saturday at 9pm and the Free and Easy folk club meet at 9pm on alternate Thursdays at the White House public house in the town centre. Some members of the Fivepenny Piece who sang traditional North Country music in the 1970s were from Stalybridge. and the band performed songs such as [...] "Stalybridge Station" [...] and [...] "Stalybridge Market". They also took [...] "In Bowton's Yard", the work of local poet Samuel Laycock, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> music.|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{reception}} to {{the first}} season of Neengalum Vellalam Oru Kodi was generally negative, though the show eventually garnered a large viewership and recorded large target rating points. A major criticism was in the questions asked to players, that {{were thought to be}} of lower-than-usual difficulty. K. Sriram later noted, [...] "the questions were not silly, the options were mocking. The feedback we got was: Don't mock your own questions. We've taken it as constructive feedback <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Big Synergy team". Difficulty level of questions became more accepted among public in later episodes. Neengalum Vellalam Oru Kodi received 5 million viewers on its first episode of the third season.|$|E

2500|$|By 1978, Kath was {{regularly}} carrying guns {{around and}} enjoyed playing with them. Around 5 p.m. January 23, after {{a party at}} roadie and band technician Don Johnson's home in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, Kath took an unloaded [...]38 revolver <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his head, pulling the trigger several times on the empty chambers. Johnson warned Kath several times to be careful. Kath then picked up a semiautomatic 9mm pistol and, leaning back in a chair, said to Johnson, [...] "Don't worry about it... look, the clip is not even in it." [...] To satisfy Johnson's concerns, Kath showed the empty magazine to Johnson. Kath then replaced the magazine in the gun, put the gun to his temple and pulled the trigger. However, there was a round in the chamber, and Kath died instantly.|$|E
