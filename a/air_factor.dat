50|$|Many diesels are now {{turbocharged}} {{and some}} are both turbo charged and supercharged. A turbocharged engine can produce more power than a naturally aspirated engine of the same configuration. A supercharger is powered mechanically by the engine's crankshaft, while a turbocharger is powered by the engine exhaust. Turbocharging can improve the fuel economy of diesel engines by recovering waste heat from the exhaust, increasing the excess <b>air</b> <b>factor,</b> and increasing the ratio of engine output to friction losses.|$|E
50|$|For {{activities}} at sea each Army <b>Air</b> <b>Factor</b> splits into search, cover and attack squadrons. Only 1/3, not ½, of a naval force’s Air Squadrons may fly CAP. In combat involving CAP or air cover, the smaller side (usually the defender) engages {{an equal number}} of the enemy. Air attacks on ports are rationalised whether from sea or land - defending air factors fight even if they were not attacked. Naval Air Squadrons on carriers in port may be counteraired. Escort Carriers count for triple for air defence.|$|E

Na Consecrates Prithvi Tattva (Earth element), Ma does the same with Jal Tattva (Water factor) Si energizes Agni Tattva (Fire element) Va energizes Vayu Tattva (<b>Air</b> <b>factor)</b> and finally Ya energizes Akasha Tattva (Sky/Space element).|$|E
50|$|Air {{attacks on}} naval units are now much more effective, and {{also use a}} new attack table. <b>Air</b> <b>factors</b> may attack a moving fleet once for each hex it {{traverses}} in range, or attack a fleet in combat once before each round of combat (British and German naval factors may stay for {{a second round of}} combat after losing the first). Nearby <b>air</b> <b>factors</b> may give <b>air</b> cover (with a +1 DRM as they engage the attacking <b>air</b> <b>factors).</b> Before each round of air attack, the naval units make a defence roll, which may destroy some attacking <b>air</b> <b>factors</b> or cause others to abort (those factors may still attack on the next round of combat). Attacks by small numbers of <b>air</b> <b>factors</b> are thus unlikely to be effective, but a full-sized 5-factor air unit can do lethal damage to a passing fleet. Air attacks on naval bases must first counterair any <b>air</b> <b>factors</b> present in the hex, the survivors then being added to the defence strength of the hex prior to the defence roll.|$|R
50|$|<b>Air</b> (and naval) <b>factors</b> are uninverted {{ready for}} use {{at the end of}} each player-turn, not game turn (except newly built <b>air</b> <b>factors</b> redeployed on the turn they are built), making it easier to use <b>air</b> <b>factors</b> to defend key hexes just captured. Airbases may not be moved other than by {{recycling}} (removing an old one and placing a new one, once during movement and once during construction/redeployment for Germany and the USA, other countries limited to once per turn). Countries may obtain more airbases by production.|$|R

Initially Germany has 6 air units and Italy 2 (i.e. 40 factors), against three British and two French (i.e. 25 factors). By {{the end of the war}} 5 German air units (i.e. 25 <b>air</b> <b>factors,</b> assuming some have been transferred to fight Allied bombers) might be facing 5 US, 4 British and 3 Soviet (i.e. 60 <b>air</b> <b>factors).</b> <b>Air</b> units may be voluntarily split up, and single factors may be rebuilt provided they are combined by SR to form a complete air unit.|$|R

5000|$|Combat is {{resolved}} with each ship picking a target and rolling one die per gunnery factor, and each 'hit' (generally, {{a roll of}} six) is re-rolled to produce the amount of damage generated, which {{is applied to the}} target's armor factor. If the amount of damage exceeds the armor factor, the ship is sunk. Air attacks are resolved by rolling one die for each attack at a number of targets equal to the <b>air</b> <b>factor.</b> [...] (Note that this system is somewhat similar to the combat system in Dungeons and Dragons, which also consists of target selection, a die roll 'to hit,' and, if a hit is scored, a second die roll to determine a number representing a level of damage.) On a roll of five, the ship is disabled, which means that it is forced to return to port.|$|E
5000|$|The naval {{war will}} take up most of players' time during the game, the {{explicit}} idea being that a major Pacific naval battle will take as long to resolve as an armour offensive on the Eastern Front. Players still have generic naval factors as in the European game, but also have separate named aircraft carriers, normally of two (CVL) or three (CV) factors. The former are much easier to sink, and take a year to rebuild (CVs take two years). The US also has some optional four factor carriers (CVB) which did not see service in the actual war. Each carrier factor can base a single Naval Air Squadron (NAS) - {{one third of the}} size of an Army <b>Air</b> <b>Factor,</b> but equal for combat strength if fighting [...] "over water" [...] (although, because of the size differential, three losses would need to be inflicted to destroy a single AAF). Naval Air Squadrons may also base at cities, and one squadron and/or 9 naval factors may base on a one-hex island.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{player has}} <b>air</b> <b>factors,</b> {{which may be}} used either for [...] "air superiority" [...] (fighting the enemy air force), or to enhance the die roll for ground combat, to {{suppress}} ports or to interdict hexes, making them harder to move through; the numerically-superior air force, after winning the air superiority combat, may largely prevent the enemy from conducting the latter functions. Whereas the German Luftwaffe might have ten or twenty factors during the invasion of France in 1940, by 1944 the Western Allies alone might have approaching 100 <b>air</b> <b>factors,</b> enough to interdict almost every hex in France.|$|R

40|$|Combustion {{behaviour}} {{of municipal}} solid waste in a fluidised bed was studied. The effect of fluidisation number and total <b>air</b> <b>factor</b> on the combustion behaviour of {{municipal solid waste}} of high moisture content in a fluidised bed combustor was investigated. The {{first part of the}} combustion study was carried out at fluidisation numbers ranging from 5 to 7 Umf with a fixed Primary <b>Air</b> <b>Factor</b> (AF) of 0. 8. Results show that the optimum fluidisation number is 5 Umf in which the bed temperature sustained longer. The second part of the study dealt with the effect of secondary air on the bed combustion behaviour conducted at 5 Umf. The chosen range of secondary <b>air</b> <b>factor</b> is 0 – 0. 6.

The {{gross heating value}} (GHV) of the RDF was 14. 43 MJ/kg with moisture content of 25 % by weight. Parameters of interest for sustainable bed combustion were the fluidization number and primary <b>air</b> <b>factor.</b> The study was performed in a rectangular fluidized bed combustor with dimensions of 0. 3 m in width, 0. 7 m in length and 2 m in height. Sand with mean particle size of 0. 34 mm {{was used as a}} fluidization medium. The sand bed height was at 0. 3 m above the standpipes air distributor. The range of fluidization number under investigation was 5 – 7 Umf in which 5 Umf was found to be the optimum. The study was continued for the determination of the optimum primary <b>air</b> <b>factor</b> with the selected range of primary air factors being 0. 6, 0. 8, 1. 0 and 1. 2 in experiments conducted at 5 Umf. The final results showed that the optimum primary <b>air</b> <b>factor</b> was at 0. 8. An energy balance was also performed to determine the thermal efficiency of the combustion.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{is focused on the}} effect of the {{specific}} thermal energy demand and the false <b>air</b> <b>factor</b> on carbon capture applied to cement kiln exhaust gases. The carbon capture process model was developed and implemented in Aspen Plus. The model was developed for flue gases from a typical cement clinker manufacturing plant. The specific thermal energy demand as well as the false <b>air</b> <b>factor</b> of the kiln system were varied {{in order to determine the}} effect on CO 2 capture plant performance, such as the solvent regeneration energy demand. In general, an increase in the mentioned kiln system factors increases the regeneration energy demand. The reboiler energy demand is calculated as 3270, 3428 and 3589 kJ/kg clinker for a specific thermal energy of 3000, 3400 and 3800 kJ/kg clinker, respectively. Setting the false <b>air</b> <b>factor</b> to 25, 50 or 70 % gives a reboiler energy demand of 3428, 3476, 3568 kJ/kg clinker, respectively...|$|E

50|$|Bombers must bomb a {{specific}} target on the map. Interceptors, jets and <b>air</b> <b>factors</b> in range may escort bombers {{to share the}} combat losses. First, defending <b>air</b> <b>factors</b> within range, using radar if they have it, attack at least {{an equal number of}} attackers. Then, simultaneously, the target hex fires in defence and bombers roll to inflict BRP losses on the target hex. After combat, each surviving bomber then inflicts a further loss of 3 BRPs, increased or reduced by the net SW modifier; even if no attacking bombers survive combat, a fraction of the net SW modifier still inflicts loss on the defenders. 25 BRPs bombing damage on a hex creates a firestorm, which gains a DP for the attacker and, if inflicted on Japan, increases the chance of the defender surrendering.|$|R
50|$|Germany has no {{strategic}} bombers, but her <b>air</b> <b>factors</b> may bomb London - {{those which}} survive combat with the RAF (who receive +1 DRM {{for this kind}} of combat) each inflict 1 BRP loss. The losses from the Battle of Britain are usually quite minor but may be the nail in Britain's coffin, especially if an overenthusiastic British player has lost too many units in France in 1940. The increased effectiveness of <b>air</b> <b>factors</b> against fleets makes Britain more vulnerable to invasion, and in the middle years of the war Britain often finds herself suffering BRP losses and reduced SRs from German U-boats, and with many of her fleets pinned down defending the home islands or engaging in anti-submarine warfare, she may be greatly outnumbered by the Italian navy in the Mediterranean.|$|R
40|$|Research and {{development}} on fluidized-bed gasification of biomass has been initiated by Yayasan Dian Desa collaboration with NEDO (New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization of Japan) starting from small scale (2000 – 2003), bench–scale tests (2004 – 2005) and pilot–plant (2006 – 2009).

The experiments were carried out with the following kinds of biomass: rice husk, sawdust, sugarcane bagasse and spent coffee grounds. The relationship between the gasifier cold efficiency and <b>air</b> <b>factor</b> shows that the curves for rice husk and sawdust have a maximum; for bagasse the relationship is decreasing because of intensive elutriation; for spent coffee grounds due to feeder limitations, {{it was not possible to}} feed the biomass flow corresponding to <b>air</b> <b>factor</b> values greater than 0. 2.

40|$|AbstractGreater {{usage of}} {{biodiesel}} worldwide results in significant generation of glycerol waste from transesterification process of plant oil. In the work reported here, thermal conversion of biodiesel manufacturing wastes including extracted physic nut and palm shell mixed with glycerol waste {{was carried out}} using a tubular reactor at 700 - 900 °C. Studied parameters were reaction temperature, ratio of each wastes, <b>air</b> <b>factor</b> and residence time. Mixed wastes were first pelletized to cylindrical shape of 2 mm diameter and 3 mm height before feeding into the reaction vessel at the feeding rate of 5 g/min. Air and nitrogen were used as reacting and carrier gases, respectively. Product gases contained mainly of CO, CO 2, H 2, CH 4 were continuously measured by dedicated online TCD/NDIR analyzer. Results indicated that as reaction temperature increased, CO 2 decreased while yields of CO, CH 4 and H 2 increased. Greater conversion to CO 2, CO, H 2 occurred with <b>air</b> <b>factor</b> increased from 0. 0 to 0. 3. Further increase in <b>air</b> <b>factor</b> resulted in lesser CO and H 2 from greater competing combustion reactions. CH 4 decreased when <b>air</b> <b>factor</b> changed from 0. 0 to 0. 6. The maximum gas LHV's are 3. 48 MJ/m 3 and 2. 27 MJ/m 3 for glycerol waste mixed with physic nut waste and palm shell waste, respectively. The maximum of mole ratio of H 2 to CO obtained is 0. 59 for physic nut and 0. 37 for palm shell mixed wastes. These findings showed that products from co-gasification of mixed wastes from biodiesel production {{may be used for}} power generation or further upgraded to produce value added fuel product which would significantly improve the economics of this waste-to-energy process...|$|E
40|$|Bio Diesel Fuel (BDF) {{contains}} {{a lot of}} oxygen, but the ignitability is inferior because of its high viscosity compared with gas oil. Previous {{research has shown that}} the combustion status of BDF has been improved through increased net thermal efficiency with a larger fuel supply. However, the NOX density in the exhaust gas increased in that case as well with the rise of combustion temperature. In this study, effective EGR for NOX decrease is applied and the effect on operation characteristics of the engine is investigated. In particular, the expected increase in PM emissions due to the lower excess <b>air</b> <b>factor</b> is compared with that when using gas oil. The results make it clear that superior operating characteristics during BDF use can be obtained in comparison to the use of gas oil, in operating conditions with a decreased excess <b>air</b> <b>factor...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{interpretation}} of UV-visible twilight absorption measurements of atmospheric chemical constituents {{is dependent on}} how well the optical path, or <b>air</b> mass <b>factor,</b> of light collected by the spectrometer is understood.

This research studied the effect of {{concentration of}} bed materials on combustion efficiency during waste incineration. The size of bed materials, combustion temperature, and excess <b>air</b> <b>factor</b> were controlled to assess the concentration of carbon monoxide. The pressure drop was measured to evaluate the bed expansion and calculate the concentration of bed materials. Experimental {{results indicated that the}} concentration of carbon monoxide did not decrease with the decrease of residence time and increase of excess <b>air</b> <b>factor.</b> With higher heat transfer efficiency, the combustion time could be reduced and the combustion efficiency would be improved. The concentration of carbon monoxide at 700 degreesC was higher than that at 800 and 900 degreesC. The influence of heat transfer efficiency on combustion efficiency was significant as the operating temperature was higher than 700 degreesC. The concentration of carbon monoxide decreased with increasing static bed height. In addition, the size of bed materials affected the mixing and heat transfer efficiency in the sand bed.
