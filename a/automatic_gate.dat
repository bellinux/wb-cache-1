The water to the power house is supplied through five steel-lined tunnels of 30/26feet diameter. Each tunnel is designed to feed two generating units. The power house tailrace discharges into New Bong Canal, which has a length of 25,000feet with discharge capacity of about 49,000 cusecs, and terminates at an <b>automatic</b> <b>gate</b> control headworks at about 12km downstream located near old Bong Escape Headworks.|$|E
25|$|Ezekiel House left Owego in {{the spring}} of 1854 as he had taken a {{contract}} to build a county court house in the suburbs of Rockford, Illinois. Henry and his brother went to Rockford in the fall and started in business with their father. In 1857 Henry took a position with his father who was superintending the raising and reconstructing of the old city hall in Chicago. While working on a building in New York, Henry had the misfortune of having the extension muscle of his right hand severed by a chisel which dropped from a scaffold. This incapacitated his doing any carpentry work for several months. During this enforced idleness, he designed and patented an <b>automatic</b> <b>gate.</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: At {{the end of}} 1989 a new ticket issuing and {{collection}} system, including <b>automatic</b> <b>gates</b> at 63 busy central stations, was brought into full operation on the London Underground. One of the system's principal objectives, a reduction in fare evasion, {{appears to have been}} achieved. The results of before-and-after surveys undertaken by the management of the Underground suggest that fare evasion has been cut by two-thirds and that the additional revenues generated should soon pay for the cost of installing the <b>automatic</b> <b>gates.</b> An analysis of ticket sales also indicates that the more recent installation in December 1991 of <b>automatic</b> <b>gates</b> at two suburban stations has been cost-effec-tive in terms of reduced fare evasion. It is concluded that further research should be directed to identifying other high-risk stations where installation of <b>automatic</b> <b>gates</b> might be cost-effective...|$|R

The application of <b>automatic</b> sliding <b>gate</b> is wide; however {{one of the}} most important applications is for controlling flood and inundation problems in flat urban area which are caused by backwater from the main-drain/river that flows back to the drainage area. Currently, the <b>automatic</b> sliding <b>gate</b> equipped with pump, sensor and motor is being constructed in a scaled physical model in the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics of UTHM. This model will be used to find the effectiveness of the mechanism of <b>automatic</b> sliding <b>gate</b> to control backwater...|$|R

Moreover, costs can vary widely with the additional infrastructure needed {{in support of the}} treatment. For example, pedestrian <b>automatic</b> <b>gates,</b> pedestrian <b>automatic</b> <b>gates</b> with horizontal hanging bar, and pedestrian swing gates are thought of as medium-cost safety treatments with their cost generally estimated as being between $ 10, 000 and $ 100, 000 [10]. Even the total expense for low-cost solutions such as fencing estimated between $ 130 /linear ft. and $ 334 /linear ft. can be highly variable as fencing may only be for a few linear feet or could be for more than a mile [10].|$|R

50|$|A gate {{operator}} is {{a mechanical}} device used {{to open and}} close a gate, such as one {{at the end of}} a driveway.

50|$|The lawsuit {{settled in}} 2007 in Demetre's {{favor with the}} city agreeing to a {{timetable}} for certain improvements including {{the construction of a}} pier. The park has a fishing pier, two large sandy waterfront beaches, marshes, a covered picnic area, a large pond, field of green grass and the beginnings of a hiking trail. The 190-foot fishing pier extending into the harbor opened in February 2009. The pier leads to a 20-by-20-foot pier head and 40-foot floating dock. Other projects include steps leading to the beach areas and an <b>automatic</b> <b>gate</b> that opens the parking area from 6 a.m.-8 p.m. daily. The park improvements were built with $450,000 approved by Charleston City Council for the only city-owned waterfront park on James Island.|$|E
50|$|To some extent, {{the line}} has been {{designed}} to accommodate future expansion. While some stations are significantly longer than the current 2-car sets, providing room for longer train sets, extension works for other stations have been necessary. An expansion project known as The KL Monorail Fleet Expansion project is being carried out by Prasarana to ensure a more efficient and user-friendly monorail services in the future. The installation of the Platform <b>Automatic</b> <b>Gate</b> System (PAGS) is one such work under the project. This gate system is necessary to improve passenger safety as before this, there are no barriers between the passenger platforms and the tracks and this may pose dangers to the users. The project also includes the installation of a new signalling system, construction of a new depot to accommodate larger train sets and other station upgrades and universal access facilities.|$|E
