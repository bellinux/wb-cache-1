5|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> {{back on it}} today, I see {{the whole}} picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be}} one of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E

Reflecting on his arrival to the band, Mangini told Noisecreep, [...] "As I see it, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> back, I really think what {{happened}} was that this band kind of started over.

They had a vision, they had great ideas, and I just wanted to help them achieve those things." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Close My Eyes" [...] is a downtempo piano led song, {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of four minutes and 19 seconds. The lyrical {{content of the}} song speaks indirectly about Carey's relationship with Mottola, and reflects on times in her life where she has had personal struggles and troubles. Her past {{is presented in the}} lyrics [...] "I was a wayward child, with {{the weight of the world}} that I held deep inside" [...] and [...] "Life was a winding road, and I learned many things little ones shouldn't know." [...] As described by David Browne for Entertainment Weekly, Carey [...] "paints herself" [...] in the lyrics as [...] "A wayward child, with the weight of the world". He also noted that the singer seems concerned that she had to grow up quicker than was perhaps necessary, in order to live her life in a controlled environment, [...] "Maybe I grew up a little too soon." [...] During the chorus, Carey lightens the mood of the song by singing about having courage to face times of adversity, [...] "But I closed my eyes, steadied my feet on the ground, raised my head to the sky. And though times rolled by, still I feel like a child <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at the moon. Maybe I grew up a little too soon." [...] Jon Pareles for The New York Times wrote that Carey [...] "coos" [...] the lyrics [...] "Maybe I grew up a little too soon" [...] and [...] "That woman-child inside was on the verge of fading/ Thankfully I woke up in time." ...|$|E

A lot of guys I played with and against are now scouts for major league teams and we stay in touch from time to time. I made a lot of friends and had a lot of fun."

2500|$|An often {{overlooked}} literary influence on Kerouac was James Joyce, whose work he alludes {{to more than}} any other author. Kerouac had high esteem for Joyce and he often used [...] Joyce's stream-of-consciousness technique. Regarding On the Road, he {{wrote in a letter to}} Ginsberg, [...] "I can tell you now <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> back on the flood of language. It is like Ulysses and should be treated with the same gravity." [...] Additionally, Kerouac admired Joyce's experimental use of language, as seen in his novel Visions of Cody, which uses an unconventional narrative as well as a multiplicity of authorial voices.|$|E

One episode from that period that presaged his later career occurred in Detroit in 1920, when he encountered the legendary Hawaiian surfer Duke Kahanamoku at a movie theater. He shook hands with Kahanamoku and later reported, [...] "I felt that somehow he had included an invitation to me {{to come over to}} his own Hawaiian islands... <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> back now I realize how much I was influenced by this first contact with the man who has become the best-known personality in the history of surfing."

2500|$|While {{away on a}} trip to England in March 2004, Christopher {{received}} an email from Joan Porco's account admonishing him for failing classes at Hudson Valley Community College in Troy, NY. In the message, Joan and Peter complained to their son, [...] "You just left and (we) can't believe (our) eyes <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at your interim grade report.

[...] Porco earned readmission to the University of Rochester with a forged transcript from HVCC. Judge Berry refused to allow prosecutors to use the forged transcripts as evidence in their criminal case against Christopher Porco.|$|E
