Isabel and her sister received a remarkable education, although they were given no preparation for governing the nation. PedroII excluded Isabel from participation in government business and decisions.|$|E

5|$|Æthelwig's {{relationship}} with Wulfstan, when Wulfstan was {{acting as the}} abbot's diocesan bishop, {{appears to have been}} tense, for on the only recorded visitation by Wulfstan to Evesham during Æthelwig's abbacy, Æthelwig was not there. Although in legal matters Wulfstan and Æthelwig were in conflict, personally, Æthelwig is said to have regarded Wulfstan <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>father</b> figure, and as the abbot's confessor. The fact that the Evesham's house chronicle appears to have been reworked after 1100 to gloss over embarrassing incidents of the abbots submitting to the bishops of Worcester makes evaluation of Æthelwig's relations with his episcopal superiors more difficult.|$|E
5|$|After fans likened Naruto, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno to {{the three}} main {{characters}} from Harry Potter fantasy books, Kishimoto noted that both trios began their careers in a classroom, though {{he added that the}} similarity was unintentional. During the series' publication, Kishimoto married and had children. This influenced how he viewed Naruto's character. Naruto met his parents, and learned of their sacrifices in order to help him to control the Fox inside him so that he could protect their world. As a result, Naruto appreciated his life more and learned that his parents loved him, something the author wanted the character to feel based on his own experience <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>father.</b> In the first chapters of the series, Kishimoto did not conceive the idea that Naruto would be the son of Minato Namikaze. However, as time passed on, the manga author made touches to Minato's face shown in the Hokage Mountain in Konoha to make them more similar to Naruto with an emphasis on their spiky hairs. However, in order to reduce too many similarities, Kushina Uzumaki's character was made to look like Naruto's face. Kishimoto's first editor, Kosuke Yahagi, praised the author for the way he handled Naruto's parents and his heritage.|$|E

Despite the awkward {{past couple of}} weeks, Jan has gifted them an espresso machine, {{and the rest of}} the office jumps on the {{opportunity}} to 'test' out several espresso flavors. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) enlists Clark's help to snag a newly freed account at a suit warehouse; the two will pose <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>father</b> and son so that they can successfully sell to the Stones, father and son owners of the warehouse. Dwight leads off on how proud he is of Clark to elder Stone (Ed Lauter), but when Stone admits that he and his son are not on good terms, Dwight and Clark awkwardly shift gears and begin a show of childishly sniping at each other. Clark tries to move on to business, but Dwight continues to interrupt him with insults, and even makes a dig at the younger Stone (Will Greenberg) when he arrives. When the elder Stone reveals that his son has forced him out of the company and that he is now there strictly for his own social benefit, Clark takes the lead and makes the sale to the younger Stone. Both Dwight and Clark also buy a suit from the company to celebrate their team sale.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{regarded}} as the greatest batsman {{in the history of}} cricket, the right-handed Bradman played in all five Tests as captain at No. 3. Bradman was more influential than other Australian captains because he {{was also one of the}} three selectors who had a hand in choosing the squad. He was also a member of the Australian Board of Control while still playing, a privilege that no other person has held. At the age of 40, Bradman was by far the oldest player on the team; three-quarters of his team were at least eight years younger, and some viewed him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>father</b> figure. Coupled with his status as a national hero, cricketing ability and influence as an administrator, this associated the team more closely to him than other teams to their respective captains. Bradman's iconic stature as a cricketer also led to record-breaking public interest and attendances at the matches on tour.|$|E

Dudley performed many different jobs, from carrying buckets of waters to counting ticket sales. Dudley was a close friend of Vincent J. McMahon and continued working for the family when the younger McMahon took over the business from his father; in particular, he drove McMahon's limousine and served as his bodyguard. He has said that he thought of McMahon <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>father</b> figure. McMahon later increased Dudley's responsibilities with the company several times, and eventually assigned him to manage Turner's Arena in Washington, D.C., which made Dudley the first African-American to hold such a position in the United States. His role required him to oversee several other events, including the Town and Country Jamboree television show.|$|E
