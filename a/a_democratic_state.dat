5|$|Indiana's {{political}} polarity {{continued to}} worsen after the Emancipation Proclamation (1863) made freeing the slaves a war goal. Many of the formerly pro-war Democrats moved to openly oppose the war, and Governor Morton began {{a crackdown on}} dissidents. During one notorious incident in May 1863, the governor had soldiers disrupt <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>state</b> convention in Indianapolis, causing what would latter {{be referred to as}} the Battle of Pogue's Run. No regular session of the Indiana General Assembly was convened until June 1865.|$|E
5|$|Morton's moves caused {{considerable}} rage {{among the}} Democrats, who launched a vicious {{attack on the}} governor. He responded by accusing his Democratic opponents of treason. Following {{the suppression of the}} General Assembly in 1862, Morton asked General Henry B. Carrington for assistance in organizing the state's levies for service. He also established an intelligence network under Carrington's leadership to deal with rebel sympathizers affiliated with the Knights of the Golden Circle, and, beginning in 1863, the American Knights, which merged with the Sons of Liberty. Members of these secret groups included Democrats and others who supported states-rights and opposed the Union cause during the war. Carrington succeeded in keeping the state secure, but his operatives also carried out arbitrary arrests, suppressed freedom of speech and freedom of association, and generally maintained repressive control over the southern-sympathetic minority. In an incident that would later be referred to as the Battle of Pogue's Run, Morton had soldiers disrupt <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>state</b> convention, where many leaders of the Democratic Party were arrested, detained, or threatened. Morton also urged pro-war Democrats to abandon their party in the name of unity {{for the duration of the}} war, and met with some success. Former governor Joseph A. Wright was among the Democrats who had been expelled from the party in 1854, and in an attempt to show his bipartisanship, Morton appointed him to the U.S. Senate.|$|E

He {{is the only}} person to hold to every elected seat in the state government under the 1816 constitution. His brief term as governor was marked by the calling of a state constitutional convention and overshadowed by the national anti-slavery debate, where Dunning urged state leaders to issue and forward resolutions to Congress expressing opposition to the expansion of slavery. As a delegate to the subsequent convention, he successfully advocated legislative and educational reform. As the American Civil War broke out, he left the Democratic party and declared for the Union, personally raising many companies of soldiers for the war effort. He returned to the state senate during the war, and then resumed his law practice after his term ended.

500|$|Demosthenes {{decided to}} prosecute his wealthy {{opponent}} {{and wrote the}} judicial oration Against Meidias.

He stated that <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>state</b> perishes if the rule of law is undermined by wealthy and unscrupulous men, and that the citizens acquire power and authority in all state affairs due [...] "to the strength of the laws".

500|$|Work on the Fundamental Principles {{had started}} under Amin: it {{guaranteed}} democratic rights such as freedom of speech, {{the right to}} security and life, the right to peaceful association, the right to demonstrate and the right that [...] "no one would be accused of crime but {{in accord with the}} provisions of law" [...] and that the accused had the right to a fair trial. The Fundamental Principles envisaged <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>state</b> led by the PDPA, the only party then permitted by law. The Revolutionary Council, the organ of supreme power, would convene twice every year. The Revolutionary Council in turn elected a Presidium which would take decisions on behalf of the Revolutionary Council when it was not in session. The Presidium consisted mostly of PDPA Politburo members. The state would safeguard three kinds of property: state, cooperative and private property. The Fundamental Principles said that the state had the right to change the Afghan economy from an economy where man was exploited to an economy were man was free. Another clause stated that the state had the right to take [...] "families, both parents and children, under its supervision." [...] While it looked democratic at the outset, the Fundamental Principles was based on contradictions.|$|E
