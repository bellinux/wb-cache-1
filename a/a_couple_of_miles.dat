Moreover, if they were bounced by Spitfires, the Bf 109s would take too long to accelerate to full throttle in order to escape.|$|E

US131 meets I-94 southwest of Kalamazoo {{and picks up the}} Business Loop I-94 (BLI-94) designation for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles.</b> This secondary designation leaves the freeway at exit36 and follows US131's business loop along Stadium Drive into downtown Kalamazoo near the main campus of Western Michigan University. As the freeway passes the west side of Kalamazoo the environs change to a more forested and semi-residential area. US131 passes the northern end of Bus. US131, a freeway spur accessible from the southbound lanes of US131. North of this partial interchange the freeway crosses into eastern Allegan County.|$|E

These wounded soldiers were probably {{treated by the}} 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance {{which was in the}} field <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> past Al-Faluja. The ambulance had itself suffered two casualties when subjected to artillery fire from the hills. But they halted and put up a tent and after dark took in eight more patients all hit by high-explosive shells from the 4th Light Horse Regiment. They were busy until midnight; two seriously wounded soldiers being evacuated to a Casualty Clearing Station and the rest were kept till morning.|$|E

The highway separates from the railroad for several miles prior to rejoining at the city of Clayton at the DecaturNorton county line. K-383 leaves the railroad again southwest of the village of Oronoque, heading east then curving north to cross Prairie Dog Creek at its entrance to Keith Sebelius Lake.

25|$|The {{nearby town}} of Coulson {{appeared}} a far more likely site. Coulson was a rough and tumble town where arguments were often followed by gunplay. Liver-Eating Johnston was a lawman in Coulson. Perhaps the most famous person {{to be buried in}} Coulsons Boothill cemetery is Muggins Taylor, the scout who carried the news of Custer's Last Stand to the world. Most buried here were said to have died with their boots on. The town of Coulson had been situated on the Yellowstone River, which made it ideal for the commerce that steamboats brought up the river. However, when the Montana & Minnesota Land Company oversaw the development of potential railroad land, they ignored Coulson, and platted the new town of Billings just <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> to the Northwest. Coulson quickly faded away; most of her residents were absorbed into Billings. Yet for a short time the two towns co-existed: a trolley even ran between the two. But ultimately there was no future for Coulson as Billings grew. Though it stood {{on the banks of the}} Yellowstone River only <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> from the heart of present-day Downtown Billings, the city of Billings never built on the land where Coulson once stood. Today Coulson Park sits along the banks of the Yellowstone where the valley's first town once stood.|$|E

In Indianola, Texas, the storm blew down fledgling settlements and sank ships, seriously hindering coastal trade.|$|R

In 1931 Starr {{established}} a retreat center at East Challacombe, North Devon (<b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> from Combe Martin), where he invited Meher Baba {{to come and}} meet westerners. It was at the Devon retreat that many of Meher Baba's lasting followers from Europe and the United States first met Baba. Meredith was famously lacking {{in a sense of}} humor and had a particular sense of how spiritual conduct should be, thus enforcing strong codes of serious contemplative conduct that made even Meher Baba uncomfortable. Yet he is considered to have {{played a central role in}} introducing Meher Baba to the western world.|$|E
25|$|The Wrythe {{lies between}} Carshalton village {{to the south}} and St Helier to the north-west. Its name is thought to derive from the rye that was once grown in this area, or from the Anglo-Saxon word rithe which means a small stream. During the time of the Roman {{occupation}} of the British Isles, a small spring was situated near the green, now adjacent to a BP garage. Roman activity in the area is confirmed by {{the fact that there was}} once a Roman Villa built in Beddington, just <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> away, and a number of roads in the vicinity of Roman origin. The spring has since disappeared under ground and the culvert it feeds flows into the Wandle near Hackbridge.|$|E
25|$|The first {{building}} {{placed at}} Dinas Brân {{was not the}} castle which now stands in ruins {{on top of the}} mountain but an Iron Age hillfort built around 600 BC. An earthen rampart was constructed probably topped by a wooden palisade and this was further protected by a deep ditch on the shallower southern slope. The walls of the hillfort encircled a village of roundhouses. Dinas Brân is one of many hillforts in this part of Wales; Moel y Gaer is just <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> to the north-west near the Horseshoe Pass, and another is close by at Y Gardden in Ruabon to the east. There are many others on the Clwydian Hills further to the north and in the Marches to the south.|$|E

The timber for the frames was similarly not definitively determined, although one frame was probably of Amoora or of the Afzelia genus of the Fabaceae family. Afzelia is interesting in that the three main species A. africana, A. bipindensis and A. pachyloba are mostly found in a small part of Africa, stretching from the mid-western coast in a thin band towards the east coast and stopping short <b>of</b> it by <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred <b>miles.</b>|$|R
25|$|The exact {{location}} of the Chera capital has been subject to some speculation. The Chera capital has been called, 'Vanchi' and 'Karur' in several works. This has led to several theories identifying the Chera capital in places named Karur in both Kerala and Tamil Nadu. However, it is fairly clear that the capital was near the famous port known as Muziris, now identified to be near modern-day Kodungallur. Pliny refers to Muziris as the Chera capital, while {{the author of the}} Periplus identifies the capital to be <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> away {{from the mouth of the}} river at Muziris. Ptolemy who identifies the capital as 'Karoura' gives a geographical location that is very close to Muziris as well. The capital of the Cheras and the port of Muziris were very close and almost indistinguishable.|$|E
25|$|The Red Pike ridge {{occupies}} a broad area of high country between Nether Beck {{in the west}} and Mosedale in the east. The Mosedale face is steeper with considerable areas of Crag, whilst the western slopes descend slowly over <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles.</b> The ridge begins at an unnamed col to the southeast of Scoat Fell. This narrow depression is squeezed between Black Comb, the birthplace of Mosedale Beck, and Scoat Tarn, the primary feeder of Nether Beck. From the depression it is only a short climb to the summit of Red Pike, the majority of the ridge lying beyond on the long south easterly descent to Dore Head. At this col the watershed turns south west, rising to the twin summits of Yewbarrow. Dore Head is the source of Over Beck, the stream separating Yewbarrow from the long western flanks of Red Pike.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a long}} shared history between Saint Joseph and Mount St. Mary's. In 1815, Mother Seton sent {{several of}} the Sisters of Charity to manage the Infirmary at Mount St. Mary's. As {{enrollment}} at Saint Joseph's Academy grew in the 1800s, some professors from Mount St. Mary's {{were added to the}} Saint Joseph's faculty. And, since the campuses of the all female Saint Joseph College and the all male Mount St. Mary's were just <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> apart, the schools historically depended on each other for social life. In 1967, female students at Saint Joseph College began taking some classes at Mount St. Mary's, and men from Mount St. Mary's began taking some classes at Saint Joseph. In 1973, with declining enrollment numbers and rising operating costs, Saint Joseph College closed its doors and merged with Mount St. Mary's, which has been fully co-educational since then.|$|E

Against this square angle of the Danube the barbarian pressure was greatest. When they broke through there it was inevitable that the empire should fall into two parts.|$|R
