On December 17, he scored a season-high 35 points in a 109–99 {{overtime}} win over the Toronto Raptors. On March 21, 2016, he scored 15 of his 29 points {{in the fourth quarter}} to help Charlotte rally from a 30–7 deficit in the second quarter for a 91–88 comeback victory over San Antonio, snapping the Spurs' six-game winning streak. Charlotte was the first team to score seven points or fewer in the opening quarter <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> win since 2008. It was also the largest comeback surrendered by the Spurs in the Tim Duncan era, which began in 1997. Lin was 11-of-18 from the field and hit all four three-point attempts, including three in the fourth quarter, and provided the go-ahead jumper with 48 seconds left. Lin's first and only season with the Hornets came to an end after the Hornets were defeated by the Heat {{in the first round of}} the playoffs.|$|E

25|$|In September 2009 the Hungarian {{media was}} overflowed {{by the news}} that Radulovics might be {{reactivated}} <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> help Dunaújváros, that lost most of their players due to their economy problems. These news proved to be true, and she played her first competitive match {{after two years of}} absence on 18 September 2009 against Hunnia KSK, scoring four goals and giving a number of assists in the fixture. Since her return, Radulovics played in top form, and although had an injury-plagued year behind her, she still ranked eleventh in the league's top scorers' list with 112 goals in the 2010–2011 season.|$|E
25|$|The Eagles {{opened the}} 2014 season winning their {{first three games}} and making NFL history as the only team ever to trail by ten or more points in their first three games <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> win. Nick Foles {{struggled}} with turnovers, but ultimately did well and led the Eagles to a 6–2 record, before breaking his collarbone, resulting in his job getting taken over by Mark Sanchez, who outplayed Foles despite facing more playoff teams. The Eagles held the divisional title from week one to week 15 against the Cowboys. After going 9–3 with their crucial win over the Cowboys, the Eagles lost their next 3, and a week after losing the NFC East title, they lost an upset against the 3–11 Redskins and were eliminated from playoff contention with the Cowboys' win over the Colts.|$|E
500|$|Obsidian drew {{on older}} {{computer}} RPGs for inspiration on the storyline and gameplay, like Fallout and the Ultima series. Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart said [...] "We've {{been thinking about}} a lot of older RPGs, and we have this feeling that something has been lost with recent RPGs." [...] He compared Neverwinter Nights 2 to Baldur's Gate II, stating that he wanted to expand upon the city of Neverwinter as Baldur's Gate II had done with its setting, Athkatla. [...] "We're looking at how to make Neverwinter a really intriguing place to be, and make it a place where you go <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> and go <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> and have it really be a center for the game," [...] Urquhart said. The game's story, while still revolving around the city of Neverwinter, would be unrelated to Neverwinter Nights. Instead of starting the game as a powerful, important character, players would begin Neverwinter Nights 2 as nobodies. Obsidian wanted realism in the game and concrete consequences for the player's actions. The story would be centered on the player character, who would have to gradually earn the respect of Lord Nasher and the city of Neverwinter.|$|E

500|$|One of the {{challenges}} the writers faced was scaling down their ideas to make them feasible for production. [...] Cuse said that he let such ideas flourish because of his relative inexperience with writing for television series. An example given by the writers was Boam's idea for a full-sized [...] "pirate ship on wheels". The writers quickly realized they needed to scale the idea down to something the production designers could create. They settled on putting a full pirate crew on a stagecoach with cannons. Kern said {{it was better to}} [...] "shoot past the mark, <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> it, rather than start below it". He elaborated on this, saying, [...] "if you envision the 40-foot galleon and go back from that, you'll always end up with more than if you start out with a pirate on a horse." ...|$|E

500|$|... "In the Name of the Grandfather" [...] was {{the first}} episode written by Matt Marshall who had {{previously}} worked on the show as a writers' assistant. In 2007, he pitched the idea of Grampa being neglected and the Simpsons taking him to Ireland. The script {{was ready for a}} table read in late 2007, but the Writers Guild of America strike delayed work on the episode. Executive producer Al Jean said the episode is intended to be [...] "an affectionate love letter to Ireland" [...] because many of the writers have Irish roots. He added, [...] "The episode is based on the experiences of myself {{and a lot of the}} writers on The Simpsons who have Irish ancestry <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> visit to find it very different, much more hi-tech." [...] According to James L. Brooks, the story was also inspired by a New York Times article about the effects of the smoking ban in Ireland on pubs.|$|E
500|$|... "After Tonight" [...] was a song Carey {{wrote with}} David Foster and Diane Warren. Carey had strong {{feelings}} about the song, as she wrote it about her relationship with Luis Miguel. The song was compared instrumentally to [...] "My All" [...] from Butterfly, which features traces of Latin and guitar instrumentation. In the lyrics, the protagonist asks her lover if he will still love her <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her [...] "after tonight." [...] Carey's cover of the Phil Collins song [...] "Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)" [...] was originally {{intended to be a}} solo ballad. The song was re-done after the album was released, with music by the Irish band Westlife replacing the song's instrumental bridge. [...] "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)" [...] was one of the album's most uplifting ballads, lyrically serving as an anthem for fans and listeners. The message, Carey said, was a personal theme of hers growing up, of not letting others [...] "bring her down" [...] and not allowing them to take away the light inside her.|$|E
500|$|The dolphin's {{search for}} food is {{aided by a}} form of sonar known as echolocation: it locates objects by {{producing}} sounds and listening for the echos. A broadband burst pulse of clicking sounds is emitted in a focused beam {{in front of the}} dolphin. When the clicking sounds hit an object in the water, like a fish or rock, they bounce off <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the dolphin as echoes. Echolocation tells the dolphins the shape, size, speed, distance, and location of the object. To hear the returning echo, they have two small ear openings behind the eyes, but most sound waves are transmitted to the inner ear through the lower jaw. As the object of interest is approached, the echo becomes booming, and the dolphins adjust by decreasing the intensity of the emitted sounds. (This contrasts with bats and sonar, which reduce sensitivity of the sound receptor.) The interclick interval also decreases as the animal nears the target. Evidently, the dolphin waits for each click's echo before clicking again. Echolocation details, such as signal strength, spectral qualities, and discrimination, are well understood by researchers. Bottlenose dolphins are also able to extract shape information, suggesting they are able to form an [...] "echoic image" [...] or sound picture of their targets.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Indie Journal, Joseph said that when writing music he prefers {{to concentrate on the}} melody first, stating, [...] "Basically, I write from a two-person standpoint. [...] First, I let the song take hold and I put down the idea as a raw emotional statement. Then I let it breathe and come back, approaching from more of an objective point of view. This allows me to rediscover the true meaning I intended in the beginning, shedding new light on how I can best represent that to the listener." [...] This same concept is explained again in a taped interview with the Government Television Network with Joseph explaining that a lot of times he may only come up with part of a melody. [...] Then he would let it rest <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> it and see if it feels right. [...] Then he would start [...] "building around it", [...] like putting a car together - start with a frame and then start building things around it. Musically, he tries to connect a common bridge between such exhilarating feelings as performing at the Acropolis, to the emotions each and every one feels every day. [...] "In the end, a good melody will always stand the test of time", says Joseph.|$|E

He clarified that Unorthodox Jukebox was more of him and what he stands for, mainly because he didn't have to modify things. He elaborated, [...] "If I'm changing things around because people might think it's a hard pill to swallow then I'm going {{to feel like a}} circus clown onstage, selling something fake". The variety of music styles presented on Unorthodox Jukebox resulted in his rejection from his label several times in the past; he also confessed that he had to face criticism by label presidents, who—according to him—expressed, [...] "Your music sucks, you don't know who you are, your music is all over the place, and we don't know how to market this stuff. Pick a lane <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> us". To these statements, the singer added that he felt [...] "disgusted" [...] as he wanted to have the liberty to create his own music and not the music he was told to do.|$|E
