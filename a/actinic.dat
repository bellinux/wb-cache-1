5|$|The Patries {{envelope}} {{was composed}} of four alternating layers of cotton cloth and vulcanised rubber (the envelope of its predecessor, the Jaune, comprised three layers). The outside layer was of cotton cloth, covered with lead chromate to prevent the <b>actinic</b> components of sunlight from destroying the rubber skin which formed the second layer. This second layer prevented leakage of the hydrogen lifting gas from the envelope. The third layer was of cotton, which was protected by the rubber fourth and final layer from damage caused by the hydrogen. This final rubber layer was thinner, and therefore lighter, than the first. The rubber sheeting for the second and fourth layers was supplied by the German company Continental AG.|$|E

2500|$|Chromium {{intensification}} or Photochromos uses {{potassium dichromate}} together with [...] equal parts of concentrated hydrochloric acid diluted down to approximately 10% v/v to treat weak and thin negatives {{of black and}} white photograph roll. This solution reconverts the elemental silver particles in the film to silver chloride. After thorough washing and exposure to <b>actinic</b> light, the film can be redeveloped to its end-point yielding a stronger negative which is able to produce a more satisfactory print.|$|E
2500|$|A {{potassium}} dichromate solution in sulfuric acid {{can be used}} to produce a reversal negative (i.e., a positive transparency from a negative film). This is effected by [...] developing a black and white film but allowing the development to proceed more or less to the end point. The development is then stopped by copious washing and the film then treated in the acid dichromate solution. This converts the silver metal to silver sulfate, a compound that is insensitive to light. After thorough washing and exposure to <b>actinic</b> light, the film is developed again allowing the previously unexposed silver halide to be reduced to silver metal.|$|E
2500|$|Laboratory {{glassware}} may be {{made from}} several types of glass, each with different capabilities and used for different purposes. [...] Borosilicate glass is transparent and can withstand thermal stress. [...] Quartz glass can withstand very high temperatures and is transparent {{in certain parts of}} the electromagnetic spectrum. [...] Darkened brown or amber (<b>actinic)</b> glass can block ultraviolet and infrared radiation. [...] Heavy-wall glass can withstand pressurized applications. [...] Fritted glass is finely porous glass through which gas or liquid may pass. [...] Coated glassware is specially treated to reduce the occurrence of breakage or failure. [...] Silanized (siliconized) glassware is specially treated to prevent organic samples from sticking to the glass.|$|E
2500|$|In a saltwater/reef aquarium, color {{temperature}} {{is an essential}} part of tank health. [...] Within about 400 to 3000 nanometers, light of shorter wavelength can penetrate deeper into water than longer wavelengths, providing essential energy sources to the algae hosted in (and sustaining) coral. This is equivalent to an increase of {{color temperature}} with water depth in this spectral range. Because coral typically live in shallow water and receive intense, direct tropical sunlight, the focus was once on simulating this situation with 6500K lights. In the meantime higher temperature light sources have become more popular, first with 10000K and more recently 16000K and 20000K. [...] <b>Actinic</b> lighting at the violet end of the visible range (420–460nm) is used to allow night viewing without increasing algae bloom or enhancing photosynthesis, and to make the somewhat fluorescent colors of many corals and fish [...] "pop", creating brighter display tanks.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mutation}} {{alters the}} structure and function of skeletal muscles producing one of three forms of myopathy: type 3 nemaline myopathy, congenital myopathy with an excess of thin myofilaments (CM) and Congenital myopathy with fibre type disproportion (CMFTD). Mutations have also been found that produce “core” myopathies). Although their phenotypes are similar, in addition to typical nemaline myopathy some specialists distinguish another type of myopathy called <b>actinic</b> nemaline myopathy. In the former, clumps of actin form instead of the typical rods. It is important to state that a patient can show {{more than one of}} these phenotypes in a biopsy. The most common symptoms consist of a typical facial morphology (myopathic faces), muscular weakness, a delay in motor development and respiratory difficulties. The course of the illness, its gravity and the age at which it appears are all variable and overlapping forms of myopathy are also found. [...] A symptom of nemalinic myopathy is that “Nemaline rods” appear in differing places in Type 1 muscle fibres. These rods are non-pathognomonic structures that have a similar composition to the Z disks found in the sarcomere.|$|E
60|$|The Scientist {{finds this}} reasonable, natural, and not harder to believe than {{that the disease}} germ, a {{creature}} of darkness, perishes when exposed to {{the light of the}} great sun--a new revelation of profane science which no one doubts. He reminds us that the <b>actinic</b> ray, shining upon lupus, cures it--a horrible disease which was incurable fifteen years ago, and had been incurable for ten million years before; that this wonder, unbelievable by the physicians at first, is believed by them now; and so he is tranquilly confident that the time is coming when the world will be educated up to a point where it will comprehend and grant that the light of the Spirit of God, shining unobstructed upon the soul, is an <b>actinic</b> ray which can purge both mind and body from disease and set them free and make them whole.|$|E
60|$|But this is {{the very}} least amount of change of climate that would {{certainly}} occur every 10,500 years when there was a high excentricity, for it is impossible to doubt that a varying distance of the sun in summer from 86 to 99 millions of miles (which is what occurred during--as supposed--the Miocene period, 850,000 years ago) would produce an important difference in the summer temperature and in the <b>actinic</b> influence of sunshine on vegetation. For the intensity of the sun's rays would vary as the square of the distance, or nearly as 74 to 98, so that the earth would be actually receiving one-fourth less sun-heat during summer at one time than at the other. An equally high excentricity occurred 2,500,000 years back, and no doubt was often reached during still earlier epochs, while a lower but still very high excentricity has frequently prevailed, and is probably near its average value. Changes of climate, therefore, every 10,500 years, of the character above indicated and of varying intensity, have been the rule rather than the exception in past time; and these changes must have been variously modified by changing geographical conditions so as to produce climatic alterations in different directions, giving to the ancient lands either dry or wet seasons, storms or calms, equable or excessive temperatures, in a variety of combinations of which the earth perhaps affords no example under the present low phase of {121} excentricity and consequent slight inequality of sun-heat.|$|E
60|$|So soon as {{the seizure}} of the {{existing}} supplies of atomic ammunition and the apparatus for synthesising Carolinum was assured, the disbanding or social utilisation of the various masses of troops still under arms had to be arranged, the salvation of the year's harvests, and the feeding, housing, and employment of the drifting millions of homeless people. In Canada, in South America, and Asiatic Russia there were vast accumulations of provision that was immovable {{only because of the}} breakdown of the monetary and credit systems. These had to be brought into the famine districts very speedily if entire depopulation was to be avoided, and their transportation and the revival of communications generally absorbed a certain proportion of the soldiery and more able unemployed. The task of housing assumed gigantic dimensions, and from building camps the housing committee of the council speedily passed to constructions of a more permanent type. They found far less friction than might have been expected in turning the loose population on their hands to these things. People were extraordinarily tamed by that year of suffering and death; they were disillusioned of their traditions, bereft of once obstinate prejudices; they felt foreign in a strange world, and ready to follow any confident leadership. The orders of the new government came with the best of all credentials, rations. The people everywhere were as easy to control, one of the old labour experts who had survived until the new time witnesses, 'as gangs of emigrant workers in a new land.' And now it was that the social possibilities of the atomic energy began to appear. The new machinery that had come into existence before the last wars increased and multiplied, and the council found itself not only with millions of hands at its disposal but with power and apparatus that made its first conceptions of the work it had to do seem pitifully timid. The camps that were planned in iron and deal were built in stone and brass; the roads that were to have been mere iron tracks became spacious ways that insisted upon architecture; the cultivations of foodstuffs that were to have supplied emergency rations, were presently, with synthesisers, fertilisers, <b>actinic</b> light, and scientific direction, in excess of every human need.|$|E
50|$|<b>Actinic</b> {{cheilitis}} (abbreviated to AC, also termed <b>actinic</b> cheilosis, <b>actinic</b> keratosis of lip, solar cheilosis, sailor's lip, farmer's lip), is cheilitis (lip inflammation) {{caused by}} long term sunlight exposure. Essentially it is a burn, and {{a variant of}} <b>actinic</b> keratosis which occurs on the lip. It is a premalignant condition, as it can develop into squamous cell carcinoma (a type of mouth cancer).|$|E

50|$|<b>Actinic</b> {{lighting}} {{is also used}} to limit algae growth in the aquarium. Since algae (like many other plants), flourish in shallower warm water, algae cannot effectively photosynthesize from blue and violet light, thus <b>actinic</b> light minimizes its photosynthetic benefit.|$|E
