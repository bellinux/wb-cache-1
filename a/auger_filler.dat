40|$|Powder filled sachets {{containing}} a 3 : 1 (w/w) powder mixture of diacetylmorphine base and caffeine anhydrate were {{developed as a}} dosage form for smokable heroin used {{for the treatment of}} chronic, treatment-resistant heroin addicts. The powder mixture was filled into sachets using a micro dose <b>auger</b> <b>filler</b> machine. The goal {{of this study was to}} identify the most important process variables that influence precision of dosing. Five variables were tested: auger speed, agitator speed, hopper fill level, dose interval, and dose. An experimental design was used to study the effects of each of these variables, including possible non-linear and interaction effects. A 9 -term regression model was constructed, explaining 94 % of the observed variation in dose weight variation coefficient. Dose, agitator speed and hopper fill level were the most important variables. The regression model was used to identify optimal settings of the variables for four sachet doses intended for routine manufacture. The results of four test batches manufactured with these optimised settings showed that accurate (accuracy: 99. 0 - 101. 0 %) and precise (CV: 3. 2 - 5. 3 %) filling of diacetylmorphine/caffeine sachets is possible using the micro dose <b>auger</b> <b>filler</b> machine.

40|$|In 1998, two {{clinical}} trials were {{started in the}} Netherlands to evaluate the effect of coprescription of heroin and methadone on the {{mental and physical health}} and social functioning of chronic, treatment-resistant, heroin-dependent patients. Since 75 - 85 % of the heroin addicts in the Netherlands use their heroin by "chasing the dragon," one of the two study arms concerned the coprescription of inhalable heroin. A pharmaceutical dosage form for inhalable heroin was developed for this trial, consisting of a 3 : 1 powder mixture of diacetylmorphine base and caffeine anhydrate. We describe the manufacturing process that was developed for filling sachets with this mixture in four dosages using a micro dose <b>auger</b> <b>filler.</b> In order to control product quality, in-process controls were developed to monitor the filling process and quality control tests were performed on the finished product. In-process control results have shown the filling process to be accurate and precise. The diacetylmorphine/caffeine sachets were shown to comply with the specifications for content and uniformity of mass. The finished product was found to be stable for 2 years when stored at 25 degreesC, 60 % relative humidity and for 6 months when stored at 40 degreesC, 75 % relative humidit...|$|E
40|$|Build-up is a fouling {{process in}} which a small {{fraction}} of a powder becomes a film adhered to a surface. Specifically buildup in <b>auger</b> <b>fillers</b> which is the focus of this thesis is a significant problem for industry leading to equipment downtime for cleaning, drives tripping due to high torque and reduced powder quality. The work presented in this thesis shows that for a unblended powder with a particle size {{similar to that of the}} <b>auger</b> <b>fillers</b> auger/tube clearance, build-up will be formed when powders have b- 1 Kawakita parameter of less than 0. 5 MPa and tablet strengths below 0. 6 MPa post compression to 58 MPa. It is proposed based upon results the work of Crutchley and Bridgewater [29] and Calvert et al. [30] that powders which form build-up due so due to the stresses they experience as they pass through the auger/tube clearance. Additionally this stress is a function of the ratio of the powderâ€™s particle size to the magnitude of the auger/tube clearance C. Work presented in Chapter 8 supports this conclusion showing that once C/D 90 is greater than 3. 5, build-up is not formed...|$|R
