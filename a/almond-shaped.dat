5|$|Inocybe godeyi {{leaves a}} snuff-brown spore print, while the {{individual}} spores themselves are smooth and <b>almond-shaped.</b> The spores measure 9 to 11.5 by 5.5 to 7micrometres. Each basidium bares four spores. Both the cheilocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} edges of the gills) and the pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the faces of the gills) are spindle- or bottle-shaped, with some kind of encrustation at the tip. They have thick cell walls.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is rust-coloured, while the spores {{themselves}} measure 12 to 15µm by 7 to 8.5µm. They are rough, from elliptical to <b>almond-shaped,</b> {{and covered in}} medium-sized warts. The spores are wider in C. v. hercynicus. The species {{is the only one}} in the genus to have cystidia on both the faces and the edges of the gills. A large number of cystidia are present, and, individually, they measure between 60 and 100µm by between 12 and 25µm. They are flask-shaped, with somewhat purple contents.|$|E
5|$|The <b>almond-shaped</b> spores are {{typically}} 10–12.5 by 6–7μm with thick walls measuring between 0.5–1.2μm. They {{have a small}} central apiculus (a depressed area when the spore was once attached to the basidium via the sterigma). When mounted in distilled water, they have a coarsely warty surface and appear rusty brown in colour. When mounted in a 3% KOH solution, the spores are pale lilac grey, and the surface ornamentation forms swollen pustules that loosen and dissolve. Spores are dextrinoid (meaning they turn reddish-brown when stained with Melzer's reagent) and cyanophilic (red in acetocarmine). The basidia are club-shaped, and four-spored with sterigmata up to 9.5μm long. The ridges of the locules comprise erect cystidia mixed with chains of erect cylindrical hyphae measuring 4–6μm in diameter. The cystidia are roughly cylindrical, and have dimensions of 20–60 by 4–9μm. There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae of the fungus.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-6th century, the {{introduction}} of Buddhism from Korea (Baekje) to Japan resulted in a revival of Japanese sculpture. Buddhist monks, artisans and scholars settled around the capital in Yamato Province (present day Nara Prefecture) and passed their techniques to native craftsmen. Consequently, early Japanese sculptures from the Asuka and Hakuhō periods show strong influences of continental art, which initially were characterized by <b>almond-shaped</b> eyes, upward-turned crescent-shaped lips and symmetrically arranged folds in the clothing. The workshop of the Japanese sculptor Tori Busshi, who was strongly influenced by the Northern Wei style, produced works which exemplify such characteristics. The Shakyamuni triad and the Guze Kannon at Hōryū-ji are prime examples. By the late 7th century, wood replaced bronze and copper. By the early Tang dynasty, greater realism was expressed by fuller forms, long narrow slit eyes, softer facial features, flowing garments and embellishments with ornaments such as bracelets and jewels. Two prominent examples of sculptures of this period are the Shō Kannon at Yakushi-ji and the Yumechigai Kannon at Hōryū-ji.|$|E

25|$|Epicanthic folds and oblique palpebral {{fissures}} {{are common}} among Mongoloid individuals. Most exhibit the Mongolian spot {{from birth to}} about age four. Mongoloids in general have straight, black hair and dark brown <b>almond-shaped</b> eyes, and have relatively flatter faces in comparison to caucasoid skull.|$|E
25|$|Another common figurine style {{features}} standing figurines in a stiff artificial pose and {{characterized by}} their thin limbs, elongated, bald, flat-topped heads, <b>almond-shaped</b> eyes, and downturned mouths. The figurines' legs are usually separated, often straight, sometimes bent. Toes and fingers, if shown at all, are frequently represented by lines.|$|E
25|$|Cortinarius badiolaevis {{produces}} spores which measure from 7 to 8.5 by 4.5 to 5.5micrometers (μm). They {{range from}} <b>almond-shaped</b> to ellipsoid. There are wart-like ornamentations, {{but it is}} not heavily ornamented. They are dextrinoid, meaning that they stain red-brown in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution, and stains darkly in potassium hydroxide (the KOH test). The spores are borne on basidia, with four spores per basidium. The basidia measure 25 to 35 by 7 to 10µm.|$|E
25|$|Riemenschneider's {{early success}} as a {{sculptor}} {{was due to the}} plasticity of his works, with great care being taken of modeling the folds of garments. This way of sculpting the garments as well as the typical oval faces and <b>almond-shaped</b> eyes were modelled on art from the Upper Rhine region of the 1470s, implying that Riemenschneider may have learned his trade either there or at Ulm. Later works lost some of the volume of the early sculptures, allowing a more efficient production.|$|E
25|$|The were-jaguar motif is {{characterized}} by <b>almond-shaped</b> eyes, a downturned open mouth, and a cleft head. It appears widely in the Olmec archaeological record, and in many cases, under the principle of pars pro toto, the were-jaguar motif represents the were-jaguar supernatural. The were-jaguar supernatural incorporates the were-jaguar motif {{as well as other}} features, although various academics define the were-jaguar supernatural differently. The were-jaguar supernatural was once considered to be the primary deity of the Olmec culture but is now thought to be only one of many.|$|E
25|$|Elbe started {{dressing}} in women's clothes after {{filling in for}} Gottlieb's absentee model; {{she was asked to}} wear stockings and heels so her legs could substitute for those of the model. Elbe felt surprisingly comfortable in the clothing and began identifying as a woman. Over time, Gottlieb became famous for her paintings of beautiful women with haunting, <b>almond-shaped</b> eyes dressed in chic fashions. In 1913, the unsuspecting public was shocked to discover that the model who had inspired Gottlieb's depictions of petites femmes fatales was in fact Elbe.|$|E
25|$|As {{usual in}} medieval art, {{the figures are}} not individualized, but repeat a few stylised types. They have the disproportionately large, oval faces which are {{characteristic}} of Pre-Romanesque sculpture. Their very large, <b>almond-shaped</b> eyes sit in flat sockets with sharply delineated eyebrows. The hair is composed of parallel strands from a central parting. Nevertheless, the facial expressions of some figures are very individuated and match the figures' gestures. Especially relevant in this respect is the figure of Cain who looks up to the Hand of God in heaven with fearful, terror-stricken eyes and pulls his cloak tight around his body.|$|E
25|$|A {{hand axe}} (or handaxe) is a prehistoric stone tool with two faces {{that is the}} longest-used tool in human history. It is usually made from flint or chert. It is {{characteristic}} of the lower Acheulean and middle Palaeolithic (Mousterian) periods. Its technical name (biface) {{comes from the fact}} that the archetypical model is generally bifacial Lithic flake and <b>almond-shaped</b> (amygdaloidal). Hand axes tend to be symmetrical along their longitudinal axis and formed by pressure or percussion. The most common hand axes have a pointed end and rounded base, which gives them their characteristic shape, and both faces have been knapped to remove the natural cortex, at least partially. Hand axes are a type of the somewhat wider biface group of two-faced tools or weapons.|$|E
25|$|Other {{works of}} art such as the crowns of light (circular chandeliers) made in cast bronze, dating from the Fatimid-Zirid period (around tenth-early {{eleventh}} century), originally belonged to the furniture of the mosque. These polycandelons, now scattered in various Tunisian museums including Raqqada, consist of three chains supporting a perforated brass plate, which has a central circular ring around which radiate 18 equidistant poles connected by many horseshoe arches and equipped for each of two landmarks flared. The three chains, connected by a suspension ring, are each fixed to the plate by an <b>almond-shaped</b> finial. The crowns of light are marked by Byzantine influence to which the Kairouanese artisan brought the specificities of Islamic decorative repertoire (geometric and floral motifs).|$|E
25|$|Masks {{may also}} {{indicate}} a culture's ideal of feminine beauty. The masks of Punu of Gabon have highly arched eyebrows, almost <b>almond-shaped</b> {{eyes and a}} narrow chin. The raised strip running {{from both sides of}} the nose to the ears represent jewellery. Dark black hairstyle, tops the mask off. The whiteness of the face represent the whiteness and beauty of the spirit world. Only men wear the masks and perform the dances with high stilts despite the masks representing women. One of the most beautiful representations of female beauty is the Idia's Mask of Benin in present-day Edo State of Nigeria. It is believed to have been commissioned by a king of Benin in memory of his mother. To honor his dead mother, the king wore the mask on his hip during special ceremonies.|$|E

500|$|Rather than {{attempting}} {{to capture a}} realistic portrayal of the three, Utamaro idealizes their likenesses. [...] To many viewers, the faces in this and other portraits of the time seem little individuated, or perhaps not at all. Others emphasize the subtle differences that distinguish the three in {{the shapes of the}} mouths, noses, and eyes: [...] Kita has plump cheeks and an innocent expression; her eyes are <b>almond-shaped,</b> and the bridge of her nose high; [...] Hisa has a stiffer, proud expression, and the bridge of Hisa's nose is lower and her eyes rounder than Kita's; [...] Toyohina's features fall in between, and she has an air of being older and more intellectual.|$|E
500|$|Spongiforma squarepantsii is {{a species}} of fungus in the Boletaceae family, genus Spongiforma. Found in Malaysia, it was {{described}} as new to science in 2011. It produces sponge-like, rubbery orange fruit bodies that have a fruity or musky odour. The fruit bodies reach dimensions of [...] wide by [...] tall. Like a sponge, they will resume their original shape if water is squeezed out. The spores, produced on the surfaces of the hollows of the sponge, are <b>almond-shaped</b> with rough surfaces, and measure 10–12.5 by 6–7 micrometers. The name of the fungus {{is derived from the}} cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants. S.squarepantsii is one of two species in Spongiforma; it differs from S.thailandica in its colour, odour, and spore structure.|$|E
500|$|The spores are [...] to <b>almond-shaped,</b> with {{dimensions}} of 7.2–9.7 by 4.5–5.8µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to slightly club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 30–45 by 5.5–6µm. The sterigmata (projections of the basidia that attach the spores) are 5–6µm long. The pleurocystidia (cystidia {{located in the}} gill face) are thin-walled, with long, somewhat cylindrical necks, and may range in color from translucent (hyaline) to pale brownish-yellow. They are typically 40 by 10.5µm, although they may occasionally be larger—up to 142 by 18 by 8µm. Cystidia in the gill edge—the cheilocystidia—are similar in appearance to the pleurocystidia. The hyphae of G.sulciceps have clamp connections—short branches connecting one cell to the previous cell to allow passage of the products of nuclear division.|$|E
500|$|In deposit, such {{as with a}} spore print, {{the spores}} appear white. Further details are {{revealed}} with a light microscope: the spores are ellipsoid to <b>almond-shaped,</b> smooth, thin-walled, and measure 8–12 by 4–6µm. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and typically have dimensions of 26–37.5 by 7–10.5µm. M.californiensis has [...] (cystidia on the gill edges) that measure 16–50 by 6.5–20µm. These cells have irregular projections that can {{range in size from}} 1.5–18.8 by 1.5–6.5µm and are variously shaped, from knob-like to cylindrical. The cells contain brownish contents that will stain darkly with Melzer's reagent, a common chemical reagent used in mushroom identification. With the exception of the medullary hyphae of the stem (longitudinally-arranged hyphae making up the stem surface), all hyphae contain clamp connections.|$|E
500|$|The Scottish Terrier is a small, compact, short-legged, sturdily-built terrier of good {{bone and}} substance. They have a hard, wiry, {{weather-resistant}} {{coat and a}} thick-set, cobby body which is hung between short, heavy legs. These characteristics, joined with his very special keen, piercing, [...] "varminty" [...] expression, and his erect ears and tail are salient features of the breed. The Scottish Terrier's bold, confident, dignified aspect exemplifies power in a small package. The eyes should be small, bright and piercing, and <b>almond-shaped</b> not round. The color should be dark brown or nearly black, the darker the better. The ears should be small, prick, set well up on the skull and pointed, but never cut. They should be covered with short velvety hair.|$|E
500|$|The caps {{of young}} {{mushrooms}} are roughly spherical, but soon become convex to flattened in maturity, and reach diameters of [...] The cap margin is rolled or curled inward when young, but straightens out as it matures. The cap color is white to cream. The gills are broadly adnate to slightly decurrent, with a color {{similar to the}} cap; their spacing is close to subdistant. The whitish stem is equal in width throughout, usually not straight but with curves, and [...] long by [...] thick. The upper region of the stem surface can be covered with {{what appears to be}} a white powder, and there are thin hairs near the base. The stems originate from a yellowish-brown sclerotium that is up to [...] long. The sclerotium ranges in shape from roughly spherical to <b>almond-shaped</b> to irregular, and its surface is often wrinkled and pitted. The mushroom has no distinctive odor or taste, and its edibility is unknown.|$|E
500|$|In mass, {{the spores}} {{appear to be}} brown to reddish-brown in color. Viewed with a microscope, they are [...] (<b>almond-shaped),</b> and {{typically}} measure 10–11.5 by 5.5–7µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to roughly club-shaped, four-spored, with dimensions of 25–32 by 6.5–9.5μm. They have straight sterigmata (slender extensions that attach to the spores) up to 9.5μm long. The cystidia (large, sterile cells in the hymenium) are cylindrical to roughly club-shaped, thin-walled, and measure 25–48 by 5–10μm. They are inamyloid, meaning they will not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent. The cystidia are plentiful {{on the edges of}} the locules, and occasional among the basidia. The hymenophore is made of interwoven branched hyphae that are arranged in a roughly parallel fashion. These thin-walled cylindrical hyphae have inflated septa (intracellular partitions), and are gelatinous, hyaline (translucent) and inamyloid. The subhymenium (the tissue layer immediately under the hymenium) is made of inflated hyphae that are hyaline, inamyloid, thin-walled, and non-gelatinous, measuring 9–20 by 9–14μm.|$|E
500|$|The spores of C.micaceus are reddish-brown, with {{dimensions}} of 7–10 by 4.5–6µm. Generally, they are [...] (shaped like a biconvex lens), but {{viewed from the}} side they appear more <b>almond-shaped</b> or spindle-shaped, while in front view they appear oval or mitriform (roughly {{the shape of a}} miter—a peaked cap). Spores have a germ pore, a flattened area {{in the center of the}} spore surface through which a germ tube may emerge. The spore-bearing cells (the basidia) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 10–15 by 4–7µm. Studies have shown that the basidia develop in four discrete generations. The first generation basidia are the most protuberant, and extend out the greatest distance from the surface of the hymenium. Subsequent generations of basidia have shorter and less protuberant bodies. When a living gill is viewed with a microscope, the four sets of basidia can be seen distinctly. Arthur Buller coined the term [...] to describe this mode of hymenial development. The purpose of the staggered basidia sizes is to facilitate the release of spores from the hymenium. There are four zones of spore discharge that correspond to the four sets of basidia, and basidia that have released all of their spores quickly begin to autodigest. The staggered setup minimizes the chance of spores colliding with neighboring basidia during release.|$|E
500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Spongiforma species have a brain-like to sponge-like form, and grow {{on the surface}} of the ground. They do not have a stalk, and lack a layer of outer skin. The small {{cavities}} (locules) of the fruit body are irregular in outline and measure between [...] in diameter. They are lined with a smooth, greyish-orange to brown or reddish brown hymenium (spore-bearing tissue), with sterile ridges that range in colour from white to cream. The columella (a column-like structure extending up into the fruit body) is poorly developed, pear-shaped, cream-coloured, and attached at the base to white rhizomorphs. The basidiospores are brown to vinaceous-brown in mass, <b>almond-shaped,</b> bilaterally symmetrical, and finely wrinkled. Spores bear a central apiculus (a region that was once attached to the sterigmata at the end of a basidium) and a small apical pore. The spores are reddish-brown in water, violet grey in 3%potassium hydroxide, inamyloid, and cyanophilic (turning red in the stain acetocarmine). The basidia are four-spored, and do not discharge the spores forcibly. Cystidia are common on the sterile locule edges; they are hyaline (translucent) and range in shape from cylindrical to ventricose (swollen in the middle) or rostrate (with a beaklike proboscis). The hyphae of the flesh are gelatinous and inamyloid. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
500|$|The spores are -brown {{in medium}} to heavy deposit. They are inamyloid, <b>almond-shaped,</b> contain {{one or more}} oil droplets, and measure 17.5–22.2 by 6.4-8µm. The spore wall is 0.5–1µm thick, with 12–14 {{longitudinal}} ridges. These ridges are less than 1µm tall, occasionally , converging at poles, with minute cross-striae. Although these cross-striae are visible when observed with light microscopy, they are not evident when viewed with scanning electron microscopy. The [...] (the region of a spore which attaches to the basidium via the sterigma) is 0.3–1µm long. The basidia are four-spored, club-shaped, and have numerous refractive globules; they measure 39–57 by 11–15µm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia {{on the face of}} a gill) are 42–47 by 8-12µm, swollen and beaked, slightly [...] They are abundant, arising from the subhymenium, projecting 19.3–29.6µm above the hymenial palisade, thin-walled, hyaline, and devoid of refractive contents. The cheilocystidia (cystidia {{on the edge of a}} gill) are 19–42 by 5–11µm, swollen, cylindrical to narrowly cub-shaped, thin-walled, and infrequent. The flesh of the hymenium is boletoid and strongly divergent (composed of different tissue layers). The mediostratum (middle tissue layer) is 24.7–45.7µm wide, and made of many parallel, slightly interwoven hyphae. The lateral stratum hyphae are 4.4–8.4µm wide, hyaline, gelatinized in a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH), and regularly septate. The cap cuticle is a densely interwoven trichodermial palisade (an erect, roughly parallel chains of closely packed cells) of cylindrical elements with inflated terminal cells. The terminal cells are 23.5–51.9 by 9.4–16.8µm, inamyloid, cylindrical to club-shaped, interwoven, and concentrated on the squamules. The marginal appendiculae are composed of wefts of interwoven inflated hyphae, some with faint golden spirally arranged encrusting pigments that are evident when mounted in water, KOH, and Melzer's reagent. The flesh of the cap is composed of highly interwoven hyphae measuring 7.4–11.1µm wide that are hyaline in water, gelatinized and hyaline in KOH, and regularly septate. The stipitipellis (stem cuticle) is a trichodermial palisade of cylindrical elements with inflated terminal cells. The terminal cells project 30.4–63µm, and they are cylindrical to club-shaped, occasionally with an abrupt tapering point. The flesh of the stem is made of densely interwoven hyphae that are 4.9–7.2µm wide, with spirally arranged, faint golden encrusting pigments that can be seen in KOH, Melzer's reagent, and water.
