An <b>air</b> <b>conditioned</b> hardtop version of the extended model is often used by officers, and a version developed for riot control has clear polycarbonate shielding along the rear sides and roof, as well as gunports for less-lethal weapons. The shielding allows for a wide field of view {{while at the same}} time protecting against firebombs and rock-throwing.|$|E
5|$|Despite the World War I, {{significant}} {{extensions of}} rail lines were carried out, {{particularly in the}} wheat growing areas in the north west and west. The new lengthy parallel lines {{were considered to be}} cheaper to operate than the numerous short spurs such as those in the Goulburn Valley. By 1930 the railway map of Victoria was largely complete, with the best land settled and the remaining land marginal for agriculture, with a number of lines built across the state border into the Riverina of NSW. On November 1937 the first run of the Spirit of Progress was made, a streamlined all <b>air</b> <b>conditioned</b> train run between Melbourne and Albury, led by the matching S class steam locomotives.|$|E
5|$|When {{the heated}} and <b>air</b> <b>conditioned</b> McDonald's Cycle Center opened, bicycle parking {{facilities}} with amenities, which had {{first appeared in}} the U.S. on the West Coast, did not exist in the Midwest. When it opened in 2006 the bike station was one of the country's largest and most modern. The Cycle Center's bicycle parking facilities use high-capacity, two-tiered DoubleParker racks that accommodate {{more than twice as many}} bicycles per square foot as traditional bike racks. These racks were manufactured by Josta, a German manufacturer of bicycle parking systems and stands. The interior design was a joint collaboration between the city of Chicago, Josta, and Cycle-Safe, Inc. of Grand Rapids, Michigan, which also produces lockers and racks for bicycles. The Chicago Park District runs the station, which has a full-time staff.|$|E

40|$|Subway {{system has}} many merits {{including}} large passenger carrying ability, high speed, strong controllability {{and reliability of}} driving. Nevertheless, subways also have brought many disadvantages for human. In many subway systems, noisy environments are clearly observed and passengers are exposed to higher noise levels than permissible limit. This study presents a study of noise and vibration of subway <b>air</b> <b>condition</b> system, so as to grasp the vibration distribution laws of the <b>air</b> <b>condition</b> system. By the tested of noise and vibration, the researcher find the sound distribution rule of <b>air</b> <b>condition</b> is very important Based on the consequence of the testing, the acceleration of <b>air</b> <b>condition</b> {{has little to do}} with the subway speed and more to do with the vibration of fan; When the train driving on the viaduct bridge, the acceleration of <b>air</b> <b>condition</b> is biggish in 125 Hz and In 50 - 1000 Hz the vibration of <b>air</b> <b>condition</b> is obviously. When the train running underground line, as a result of the resonance of body, air condition’s vibration is biggish in 630 Hz and the vibration is obviously in 125 - 1250 Hz. With the increase of the speed, the influence of the ground’s second radiation on body vibration is enhanced. The superfine gross wool which is used to <b>air</b> <b>condition</b> can achieve good results for noise reduction. This research has higher reference for the vibration and noise reduction of the subway <b>air</b> <b>condition</b> system...|$|R

5|$|The Nitta Maru-class {{ships were}} {{intended}} to upgrade NYK's passenger service to Europe and {{it was reported that}} Nitta Maru was the first ship to be fully <b>air</b> <b>conditioned</b> in the passenger quarters. The IJN subsidized all three Nitta Maru-class ships for possible conversion into auxiliary aircraft carriers. Kasuga Maru was the last ship of her class and was built by Mitsubishi Shipbuilding & Engineering Co. at their Nagasaki shipyard for Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK). She was laid down on 6 January 1940 as yard number 752 and launched on 19 September 1940. Sources are contradictory regarding when the conversion occurred and if the ship was completed before the conversion began. Jentschura, Jung and Mickel state that Kasuga Maru was towed to Sasebo Naval Arsenal for conversion on 1 May 1941., Stille, however, and Watts & Gordon say the conversion began while the ship was under construction. This is indirectly supported by the allocation of a new yard number, 888, to the ship. Tully, on the other hand, says that she was requisitioned on 10 February 1941 and was used as a transport until the conversion began on 1 May.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the thermal {{characteristics}} of garments marketed for Korean males and to investigate the influence of each garment on ensemble, by measuring their insulation values(clo) using thermal manikins. The results are as follows. The total insulations(clo) of ensembles for S/S seasons are between 1. 46 and 2. 6 clo, with the mean of 2. 12 clo. The insulation in the still <b>air</b> <b>condition</b> is 1. 23 clo, which means a decrease of 42 % compared to the total insulation of all the component garments. The insulation of ensembles for S/S seasons in the dynamic air con-dition decreased by 46. 8 %, compared to the still <b>air</b> <b>condition.</b> The total insulation(clo) of ensembles for F/W seasons is between 3. 84 and 7. 36 clo with the mean of 4. 74 clo. The insulation in the still <b>air</b> <b>condition</b> is 2. 26 clo, which means a decrease of 53. 6 % compared to the total insulation of all the component garments. The insulation of ensembles for F/W seasons in the dynamic <b>air</b> <b>condition</b> decreased by 36. 2 %, compared to the still <b>air</b> <b>condition.</b> As the clo value of each com-ponent garment gets higher, the insulation of ensembles gets higher. Especially, the insulation of ensembles was more influenced by outer wear than inner wear. The insulation of ensembles could be predicted by the insulation of outerwear better.
