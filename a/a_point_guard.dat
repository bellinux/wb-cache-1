5|$|Subsequent to the {{expansion}} draft, the Raptors landed the seventh pick in the NBA draft lottery, behind their fellow 1995 expansion club, the Vancouver Grizzlies. Thomas selected Damon Stoudamire, <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> out of Arizona, around whom the franchise would seek to construct its near future. Yet, the selection of Stoudamire was met with boos from fans at the 1995 NBA draft at SkyDome in Toronto, many of whom wanted Ed O'Bannon of UCLA, an NCAA Final Four Most Valuable Player.|$|E
50|$|In {{an effort}} to give the {{promising}} consensus number one overall pick from the 2010 NBA draft, John Wall, <b>a</b> backup <b>point</b> <b>guard,</b> Grunfeld signed Eric Maynor in July 2013.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard,</b> Farmer led Clay County High School to the 1987 Kentucky High School Athletic Association (KHSAA) State Basketball Championship and, in 1988, {{was named}} Kentucky Mr. Basketball and Kentucky Associated Press Male High School Athlete of the Year after setting a {{championship}} game record with 51 {{points in a}} losing effort. Although he was popular state-wide and publicly stated his desire to play collegiate basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats, Coach Eddie Sutton was reluctant to offer Farmer a scholarship. After Farmer {{announced that he would}} visit other colleges and issued a deadline past which he would no longer consider Kentucky without a scholarship offer, Sutton relented and Farmer joined the University of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{part of his}} NBA career, Parker was still {{considered}} an erratic shooter of the ball and during the 2005 off-season, Coach Popovich decided {{to work on this}} aspect of his play. Spurs shooting coach Chip Engelland forbade Parker to shoot any three-point shots, and among others, corrected his shooting motion and his thumb position. As a result, by the 2006–07 season, Parker had reduced his three-point shots by 117 while shooting 147 more normal field goal attempts compared to 2005, and his accuracy rose by 4% (field goals and three-point shots) {{and he was able to}} connect on 78% of his free throws that season. Parker's field goal percentage is also high for <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard,</b> and his speed also makes him a fast break player. However, his style of play has had adverse effects on his knees (tendinitis).|$|E

5|$|The {{first pick}} in Toronto Raptors' history was Damon Stoudamire, <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> from the University of Arizona, {{who was the}} seventh overall pick in the 1995 NBA draft. People in the crowd were {{surprised}} by this pick because they expected the Raptors to pick Ed O'Bannon from UCLA. In their second pick of the same draft, Fab Five member Jimmy King from Michigan was drafted in the second round. The Raptors won the first overall pick in 1996, {{but they had to}} give that up due to the expansion agreement with the league. Chris Bosh was selected by the Raptors as the fourth pick overall in the 2003 NBA draft, and he went on to play in three all-star games, while starting in two. Andrea Bargnani, who was selected by the Raptors with the first overall pick of the 2006 NBA draft, became the first European to be picked first overall in the NBA draft.|$|E

25|$|After high school, she was {{recruited}} by (and turned down) Harvard University, Princeton University and Dartmouth College. Stanford never recruited her, so Paye attended its women's basketball team training camp as a walk-on and tried out.

50|$|After an {{opponent}} scores, it is typically the <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> who brings {{the ball down}} court to begin an offensive play. Passing skills, ball handling, and court vision are crucial. Speed is important; <b>a</b> speedy <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> is better able to create separation and space off the dribble, giving him/herself room to work. <b>Point</b> <b>guards</b> are often valued more for their assist totals than for their scoring. Another major evaluation factor is Assist-to-Turnover ratio, which reflects the decision-making skills of the player. Still, <b>a</b> first-rate <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> should also have a reasonably effective jump shot.|$|R

25|$|In the 2003 offseason, the Lakers {{made major}} changes, with {{initially}} varying results. Needing to find <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> and a power forward {{to defend against}} Tim Duncan and the Spurs, the Lakers signed veteran stars Gary Payton and Karl Malone for well below market value; they also hoped to give both veterans their first championship ring. The Lakers were afterwards considered the favorites to win the NBA title.|$|E

25|$|The {{game has}} many {{individual}} techniques for displaying skill—ball-handling, shooting, passing, dribbling, dunking, shot-blocking, and rebounding. Basketball teams generally have player positions, the tallest and strongest {{members of a}} team are called a center or power forward, while slightly shorter and more agile players are called small forward, and the shortest players or those who possess the best ball handling skills are called <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> or shooting guard. The point guard directs the on court action of the team, implementing the coach's game plan, and managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning).|$|E

50|$|Romeo was {{not only}} <b>a</b> top <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> recruit coming out of California, but she was {{regarded}} as one of the nation's best. ESPN ranked Natalie as the 9th best <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> in the nation for the class of 2014, along with giving her a 5-star rating.

25|$|After being waived by the Lakers, Calderón {{was set to}} {{join the}} Golden State Warriors. However, after Kevin Durant {{suffered}} a possible season-ending knee injury, the Warriors felt they needed a forward instead of <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> to fill Durant's role. The Warriors still honored their agreement with Calderón, signing him on March 1, 2017 before waiving him later that day. While he was only with the team for two hours, the Warriors agreed to pay Calderón {{what he would have}} earned if he was on the team {{for the rest of the}} season; that being $415,000.|$|E
25|$|Anderson {{developed}} the ball-handling skills of <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> {{at an early}} age, but his height provided him the versatility to play as a forward. As a high school player in New Jersey, Anderson led his teams to two consecutive state titles, and was named state {{player of the year}} during his senior year. One of the top recruits out of high school, Anderson was named second-team all-conference in the Pac-12 as a freshman at UCLA while playing mostly at forward. The following season, he moved to point guard, and was voted the Most Outstanding Player of the Pac-12 Tournament as the Bruins won their first conference tournament title in six years.|$|E
25|$|The 2015–16 {{season was}} less {{successful}} for Kidd, as the Bucks {{finished with a}} 33–49 record and did not qualify to the playoffs. On December 20, 2015 {{it was reported that}} Kidd would be out indefinitely as he would undergo hip surgery on December 21. While Kidd was recovering, his assistant Joe Prunty was acting as an interim coach. On a positive note, Kidd moved rising 21-year old Giannis Antetokounmpo into <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> position, which helped the young player to record five triple doubles in the season and make progress in most statistical categories. Despite the disappointing season, the Bucks owners issued Kidd a vote of confidence and mentioned a possible prolongation of his contract expiring after the next season.|$|E
