5|$|When Nicola feels {{down about}} Simon moving on, {{she decides to}} seduce Ivan. He rebuffs her {{advances}} but she tells Lesley, Rodney and Laurel that she slept with Ivan. When Ivan tries to get the truth, she convinces everyone else that he lying. Paul refuses to speak to Ivan and makes his father throw Nicola out of her home. She then tells Laurel that she lied <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing.</b> Laurel then tells everyone inside the pub that Nicola has lied and Ivan refuses to accept everyone's apologies. Rodney thinks that Ivan and Paul should get back together and lets the whole pub know. Ivan is annoyed but then realises he is right. When Ivan asks Paul for another chance, he turns him down and Ivan leaves the village. When he returns, Simon is annoyed with him for leaving him {{to pay the rent}} on Mulberry Cottage. He forgives him when Ivan reveals that he is just back for his job. He is made haulage manager for Matthew and Sadie's new business after they poach him. However, the job soon ends and along with Simon they leave Emmerdale for a new life in Costa Rica.|$|E
500|$|The final was criticised by the media, {{with both}} teams {{receiving}} flak. Ken Jones of The Mirror wrote, [...] "Discipline {{was destroyed by}} tiredness, determination blunted by the pain of having to run some more. Behind the boredom was the failure of individuals like Leeds left winger Albert Johanneson and Liverpool left winger Peter Thompson, men who could and should have lifted the game with their talent." [...] The Times was slightly less critical of the match: [...] "In spite of much lateral 'method' play it was a tense battle of human qualities. The opening half, in particular, [...] was a quiet prelude. This was the careful shadow boxing {{that led up to}} a pulsating finish. Indeed, there was a certain hypnotic element <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing.</b> The fascination lay in trying to assess which side would first break the stalemate." ...|$|E
500|$|After House of Music was released, Tony! Toni! Toné! {{experienced}} growing tensions {{stemming from}} creative differences, business-related problems, and Saadiq's {{interest in a}} solo career. [...] "There's a quiet stress between us that no one really talks about", Saadiq told Vibe in 1997. [...] "And what's sad <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> {{is the fact that}} our friendship is disintegrating. Who knows, House of Music could be the last Tony Toni Toné album." [...] The band remained committed to promoting the record into 1997, including a February 28 taped performance at VH1's Hard Rock Live special. According to Mercury vice president Marty Maidenberg, an international tour for the album had been planned by October 1996, with concert dates in Japan and the United Kingdom, but it never materialized. In November 1997, Saadiq told the Philadelphia Daily News [...] "there should have been like four singles from that album. You'll have to call Mercury on that. It went Platinum with no promotional tour. We did our job and they made their money." [...] The group disbanded shortly afterwards, and each member went on to pursue an individual music career.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} him before!" [...] cried Olive. [...] "I never heard of him. I don't {{understand}} anything <b>about</b> it. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> shocked me, and I wanted to get on." ...|$|R
500|$|Coinciding {{with the}} counterculture's preoccupation with enlightenment, 1967 marked {{the period when}} LSD use had become {{widespread}} among rock musicians and their audience. In a 1999 interview with Billboard magazine, Harrison said his aim had been [...] "to write a rock'n'roll song <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> psychedelic <b>thing</b> of <b>the</b> time".|$|R
60|$|I {{was pretty}} sick <b>about</b> it. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> had gone wrong. Fred {{seemed to have}} lost his head entirely. He was {{behaving}} like a perfect ass. Naturally {{the man had been}} frightened with him carrying on in that way. I jumped out of the window to see if I could find the man and explain, but he was gone. Fred jumped out after me, and nearly squashed me.|$|R
500|$|The album's {{title was}} {{inspired}} by one of Shakira's trips to the capital of her native country Colombia. At the El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá, after finishing her Tour Pies Descalzos, part of her luggage was stolen, including a briefcase that contained all the lyrics Shakira {{had been working on}} for the album. Shakira commented, [...] "The worst part <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> was that I couldn't remember them because of the mental block that can be caused by such a traumatic experience as the robbery of such a personal item". Feelings of impotence and emptiness overcame Shakira with such violence that {{for a couple of days}} and nights she thought of nothing but the people who had taken her material. She could not stop thinking about them: [...] "Who are they? What are they looking for? Where are they?". She searched for a reason behind the theft of her songs. [...] "I came to the conclusion that there are all types of thieves. A thief is not just a person who takes a physical object that doesn't belong to him or her. There are thieves who steal feelings, space, time, dreams, rights", she explained.|$|E
2500|$|According to Pearce:"In 1986 whilst {{staying with}} Tibet in his flat in Freya Aswynn's house in north London {{over a period}} of 3 nights I dreamed I was falling in a sort of rain of indistinct runes. On each {{separate}} night I managed to concentrate enough on one particular rune to stop it from spinning and moving so I could actually see which one it was. When I awoke I made a note of it. After 3 nights the dream stopped and I decided to try and form an 'appropriate' bind rune from the original 3. This I did and after Freya saw it I basically was given a 'thumbs up' <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing.</b> It definitely does not refer to my name but it definitely does refer to ME." ...|$|E
2500|$|The group {{arrive at}} the cyclops' lair, but instead of a terrifying monster, they find a decadent {{creature}} named [...] "Cy" [...] (Jonathan Slinger) who wears bikini briefs and offers the fighters snacks and mojitos in his hot tub. Cy insists his bloodthirsty father {{was the one who}} stole the diamond, but that he did not approve of his father and would let the group have the diamond. Kröd agrees to some quick cocktails (despite Zezelryck's bad feeling <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing),</b> and they all play a game of Truth or Dare? in the hot tub, where Cy admits he is a bisexual cyclops, or [...] "biclops", and Aneka admits she has had sex with a troll [...] (prompting an angry Kröd to ask if there is anywhere she draws the line). When Kröd insists it's time to leave, Cy pulls a switch and traps the freedom fighters in a cage, where he plans to 'sex them to death' and make more furniture for his cave from their skeletons. However, Aneka distracts Cy by getting intimate with Kröd long enough for him to retrieve a throwing star from her underwear, and Kröd throws it into Cy's forehead.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I must {{be quite}} square with you," [...] {{the young man}} said in a tone that struck her as [...] "higher," [...] somehow, than any she had ever heard him use. [...] "If I want to see the picture it's because I want to write <b>about</b> it. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> will go bang into the Reverberator. You must {{understand}} that in advance. I wouldn't write about it without seeing it. We don't DO that"--and Mr. Flack appeared to speak proudly again for his organ.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Adam," [...] he said, {{in a tone}} of {{friendly}} concession, [...] "you're perhaps right. Perhaps I've gone a little too far in taking notice of the pretty little thing and stealing a kiss now and then. You're such a grave, steady fellow, you don't understand the temptation to such trifling. I'm sure I wouldn't bring any trouble or annoyance on her and the good Poysers on any account if I could help it. But I think you look a little too seriously at it. You know I'm going away immediately, so I shan't make any more mistakes of the kind. But let us say good-night"--Arthur here turned round to walk on--"and talk no more <b>about</b> <b>the</b> matter. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> will soon be forgotten." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{the episode}} aired, Larry David {{found himself in}} the middle of a big media frenzy {{surrounding}} the now-popular show. David gave some insight to his approach on writing the script by saying: [...] "I like taking the worst qualities that a person has and trying to make something funny out of it. Doesn’t everybody do terrible things and have terrible thoughts? Just by trying to be as funny, you’re going to deal with a lot of things that are real, so <b>the</b> show’s really <b>about</b> something. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> show being <b>about</b> nothing is ridiculous." ...|$|R
2500|$|There are {{eyewitness}} {{reports of}} the [...] "rape camps" [...] established by the Pakistani Army. [...] The US based Women Under Siege Project of the Women’s Media Center have reported the girls as young as 8 and women as old as 75 were detained in Pakistan military barracks, and where they were victims of mass rape which sometimes culminated in mass murder. The report was based on interview with survivors. Australian Doctor Geoffrey Davis was brought to Bangladesh by the United Nation and International Planned Parenthood Federation to carry out late term abortions on rape victims. He was {{of the opinion that}} the 200,000 to 400,000 rape victims were an underestimation. On the actions of Pakistan army he said [...] "They’d keep the infantry back and put artillery ahead and they would shell the hospitals and schools. And that caused absolute chaos in the town. And then the infantry would go in and begin to segregate the women. Apart from little children, all those were sexually matured would be segregated..And then the women would be put in the compound under guard and made available to the troops…Some of the stories they told were appalling. Being raped again and again and again. A lot of them died in those [...] camps. There was an air of disbelief <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing.</b> Nobody could credit that it really happened!" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{even when}} young Fizzlechip {{shot himself in}} the back room of the Mariposa House, Mr. Gingham buried him in a casket with silver handles and it was felt that there was a Monte Carlo touch <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E
60|$|Moreover, Polly {{distinctly}} {{felt guilty}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing.</b> She {{had promised to}} meet Dickie--that is Mr. Richard Frobisher--at two o'clock sharp outside the Palace Theatre, {{because she wanted to}} go to a Maud Allan matinée, and because he naturally wished to go with her.|$|E
2500|$|The Los Angeles Times {{praised the}} film's humor despite its plot inconsistencies, noting that, [...] "probably because the central story doesn't quite gel, it's the loony, {{incidental}} throwaway moments that really make an impression." [...] Chris Kaltenbach of The Baltimore Sun acknowledged the comic {{value of the}} film {{in spite of its}} shortcomings, saying, [...] "Yes, the story line meanders and too many scenes drone on; Knocked Up is in serious need of a good editor. But the laughs are plentiful, and it's the rare movie these days where one doesn't feel guilty <b>about</b> finding <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> funny." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, you two dear children, we're {{almost like}} relatives," [...] Mrs. Mortimer beamed. [...] "It's {{a breath of}} old times, alas! all {{forgotten}} in these fly-away days. I am especially interested, because I've catalogued and read everything covering those times. You--" [...] she indicated Billy, [...] "you are historical, or at least your father is. I remember <b>about</b> him. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> is in Bancroft's History. It was the Modoc Indians. There were eighteen wagons. Your father was the only survivor, a mere baby at the time, with no knowledge of what happened. He {{was adopted by the}} leader of the whites." ...|$|R
5000|$|O'Malley {{stated that}} he wanted to create a [...] "hybrid" [...] work that {{received}} inspiration from American and Japanese comics, and that he [...] "wanted to reach towards the japanese comics from my own starting point." [...] When asked if he considers Scott Pilgrim to be a manga, O'Malley responded by saying [...] "Um… No, I think I was just thinking about that today. I guess I was just thinking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> OEL <b>thing.</b> I think it’s influenced… I like the term 'manga-influenced comics,' but I only like it because no one else likes it." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{words came}} in gasps, but {{otherwise}} fairly distinctly. Doctor Newington, {{in all his}} professional experience, had never been placed in such an extraordinary dilemma. He was not quite so obstinate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> as he had originally been, {{and a kind of}} hopeless bewilderment showed itself upon his face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our {{information}} is miserably scanty," [...] Kinsley admitted. [...] "Curiously enough, {{the man who}} must know most <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> is an Englishman, {{one of the most}} curious mortals in the British Empire. A spy of his succeeded in learning more than any of our people, and without being arrested, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{something}} so weird and uncanny <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> {{that it gave}} me a turn and made me feel quite faint. I began to wish, for the first time, that I had taken Johann's advice. Here a thought struck me, which came under almost mysterious circumstances and with a terrible shock. This was Walpurgis Night! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That may be," [...] Chad returned; [...] "but all {{the same}} I'm sincere. You talk <b>about</b> taking <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> on your shoulders, but in what light do you regard me that you think me capable of letting you pay?" [...] Strether patted his arm, as they stood {{together}} against the parapet, reassuringly--seeming to wish to contend that he HAD the wherewithal; but it was again round this question of purchase and price that the young man's sense of fairness continued to hover. [...] "What it literally comes to for you, if you'll pardon my putting it so, is that you give up money. Possibly {{a good deal of}} money." ...|$|R
2500|$|After {{ten years}} of living, recording, and touring together, Europe {{decided to take a}} break {{at the end of the}} 1992 tour. [...] "I {{remember}} in the tour bus afterwards we were talking <b>about</b> where <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> was going and I think at the time the consensus of the band was we really felt ready for a break," [...] Tempest said, [...] "We felt that it was time to put some roots down and I was really into the idea of making my own solo album." [...] In that time, Tempest and Marcello released solo albums whilst the other members participated in several different projects and bands. In return, Europe was dropped from Epic Records.|$|R
5000|$|... “Live {{storytelling}} is {{a unique}} art form,” says Story Salon founder, writer/actor/comedian Beverly Mickins. “Words spoken aloud paint pictures capable of evoking laughter and tears, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> range of emotion. People have been telling each other stories since the first campfires, talking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> mix of <b>things,</b> important and trivial, that go into making life. Storytelling {{is one of the}} ways we figure out how to be human.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only in this way. I {{wanted to}} give her a Hair Bracelet myself--my hair and Blyth's, and so on. And an addle-headed old woman who seems to know Madonna (that's a name we give her) as well as Blyth himself, and keeps what she knows just as close, got me into a corner, and talked {{nonsense}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing,</b> as old women will." ...|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{tell you}} how nasty he was to me <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing,</b> {{although}} I showed myself at once ready to forgive him all his lies and his treachery, and was at great pains {{to explain to him}} how I had given up my own bed and strapped him into it solely for the benefit of his health, seeing that at the moment he was threatened with delirium tremens.|$|E
6000|$|... "It seems odd, I suppose, that I didn't," [...] Guy answered, [...] "but do {{you know}} there was an air of secrecy <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> which rather frightened me. And those {{soldiers}} had exactly the air of looking for somebody to shoot. Anyhow, while I was hesitating what to do, there was a whistle and another train came from the opposite direction. Then, of course, I waited {{to see what was}} going to happen." ...|$|E
50|$|A big {{sticking}} point for me, this was. This {{is what the}} BBC wanted and I had {{to point out to}} them that as a cat man, this was not something that I was very happy <b>about</b> at all. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> fills me with extreme concern. I might insist on having a cat on the programme, because I think the BBC as a public service broadcaster have got to give equal time in my view to cats.|$|R
5000|$|Moyet later {{described}} how her song [...] "Goodbye 70's" [...] had {{been inspired by}} her disillusionment with how the late-1970s punk scene had turned out, saying, [...] "'Goodbye 70's' is about punk and not caring how you were dressed, and then I discovered {{that so many of}} my friends that I'd thought it all really meant something to just saw it as another trend... That's what 'Goodbye 70's' was all about, <b>about</b> how sour <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> became." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fyfe {{describes}} {{the title track}} as follows: It was weird, I wrote in 2002 and was sort of thinking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Twin Towers <b>thing,</b> but then {{a couple of months}} before the London bombings we decided to drag this song out and do it as a single, and then all that stuff happened. On my birthday, as fate would have it - 7 July. Very odd. But yes, it's also just a song about appreciating life, I guess.|$|R
60|$|It {{also caused}} no small measure of {{annoyance}} that fishermen {{were ordered to}} wear tricolour cockades on their caps. They had no special ill-feeling against tricolour cockades, {{but they did not}} care about them. Jean-Marie flatly refused to have one pinned on, and being admonished somewhat severely by one of the Paris officials, he became obstinate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> and threw the cockade violently on the ground and spat upon it, not from any sentiment of anti-republicanism, but just from a feeling of Norman doggedness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Wrenn, I suppose there's no use of rubbing it in. Course {{you know}} what I think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing.</b> It strikes me you're a fool to leave a good job. But, after all, that's your business, not ours. We like you, {{and when you get}} tired of being just a bum, why, come back; we'll always try to have a job open for you. Meanwhile I hope you'll have a mighty good time, old man. Where you going? When d'yuh start out?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He hasn't spoken," [...] he replied, {{insisting on}} the word, [...] "even to-day. Two or three times I think letters came {{for him in the}} same handwriting. Mr. Warren did not open them, of course, and took them {{straight}} to Uncle Rad. They always bore foreign postmarks, some from one place, some from another; but Uncle Rad never referred to them after he had read them, nor did he instruct Mr. Warren to reply. Then the letters ceased, and I began to forget the whole business. I didn't tell you, because Uncle Rad told me not to talk <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing.</b> It was beneath contempt, he said, and he didn't want the tittle-tattle to get about." ...|$|E
5000|$|The citizens' defence groups {{sought help}} from the {{government}} in Dublin in 1969, then led by Jack Lynch. Several ministers responded and arranged a fund of £100,000 but the planned arms shipment failed. Kelly later said: [...] "These discussions were all <b>about</b> guns. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> was government-sponsored, government-backed and government-related." [...] The planning included travel to Britain, Europe, {{and on to the}} USA where he met the founders of Noraid. Kelly was one of the co-defendants in the subsequent Dublin [...] "Arms Trial" [...] with ministers Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney, accused of conspiring to import arms illegally into the Republic of Ireland. The trial eventually collapsed from a lack of evidence, as the relevant government files were kept secret, but the Irish government sacked several ministers as a result.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense. What {{was there}} to be peeved <b>about?</b> I took <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> as a great compliment, proud to feel that any drink from my cellars could have {{produced}} such a majestic jag. It restores one's faith in post-war whisky. Besides, I couldn't be peeved at anything tonight. I am like a little child clapping its hands and dancing in the sunshine. For though it has been some time getting a move on, Bertie, the sun has at last broken through the clouds. Ring out those joy bells. Anatole has withdrawn his notice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "More wiglomeration," [...] said he. [...] "It's {{the only}} name I know for the thing. He is a ward in Chancery, my dear. Kenge and Carboy will have {{something}} to say about it; Master Somebody--a sort of ridiculous sexton, digging graves for the merits of causes in a back room at the end of Quality Court, Chancery Lane--will {{have something to}} say about it; counsel will {{have something to say}} <b>about</b> it; <b>the</b> Chancellor will have something to say <b>about</b> it; <b>the</b> satellites will {{have something to say about}} it; they will all have to be handsomely feed, all round, <b>about</b> it; <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> will be vastly ceremonious, wordy, unsatisfactory, and expensive, and I call it, in general, wiglomeration. How mankind ever came to be afflicted with wiglomeration, or for whose sins these young people ever fell into a pit of it, I don't know; so it is." ...|$|R
