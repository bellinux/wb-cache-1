5|$|Dr. John Markway narrates {{the history}} of the 90-year-old Hill House, which was {{constructed}} by Hugh Crain as a home for his wife. She died when her carriage crashed against a tree <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>approached</b> the house for the first time. Crain remarried, but his second wife died in the house from a fall down the stairs. Crain's daughter Abigail lived in the house {{for the rest of her}} life, never moving out of the nursery. She died calling for her nurse-companion. The companion inherited the house, but later hanged herself from a spiral staircase in the library. Hill House was eventually inherited by a Mrs. Sanderson, although it has stood empty for some time.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Elizabeth {{undertook}} {{her first}} solo public appearance {{on a visit}} to the Grenadier Guards, of which she had been appointed colonel the previous year. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>approached</b> her 18th birthday, parliament changed the law so that she could act as one of five Counsellors of State in the event of her father's incapacity or absence abroad, such as his visit to Italy in July 1944. In February 1945, she was appointed as an honorary second subaltern in the Auxiliary Territorial Service with the service number of 230873. She trained as a driver and mechanic and was awarded the rank of honorary junior commander five months later.|$|E
5|$|By 08:00, it {{was clear}} that despite his vessels speed, Stewart's plan was going to fail: the captains of Charlton and United Kingdom had not even {{attempted}} to join his advance, deliberately checking their advance towards the French, falling far behind Windham. Although Stewart now faced overwhelming odds, he had no option but to continue the attack: his ship was now too close to attempt to flee from the French frigate. Captain Dornal de Guy opened fire at 09:30, his shot repeatedly striking Windham <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>approached.</b> Stewart did not return fire, instead waiting until his ship was closer to minimise the inaccuracy of his gunnery. Unable to reach the more nimble French ship directly, Stewart absorbed the French fire until he was as close as he was able before unleashing his guns. The results were disappointing: the entire broadside splashed into the sea far short of the French ship. The more manoeuvrable Manche now approached Windham at close range, and the two ships fired at one another for over an hour, Stewart still unsupported by his companions, who did no more than fire the occasional ineffective shot at extreme range.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, {{conditions}} were deteriorating on Königsberg. There were shortages of coal, ammunition, food, and medical supplies. Although {{safe from the}} British, the crew was ravaged by malaria and other tropical ailments. Generally {{cut off from the}} outside world, the morale of the sailors fell. However, the situation was marginally improved with a scheme to resupply the ship and give her a fighting chance to return home. A captured British merchant ship, Rubens, was renamed Kronborg. It was given a Danish flag, papers, and a crew of German sailors selected for their ability to speak Danish. It was then packed with coal, field guns, ammunition, small arms, and various supplies. As the freighter approached East Africa, Königsberg prepared to sortie to meet the ship and attempt to break out and return to Germany. Instead, Königsberg was trapped in the river by two cruisers and several smaller vessels. Hyacinth intercepted Kronborg <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>approached,</b> and chased her to Manza Bay. The trapped ship was forced aground and set on fire, but the Germans salvaged much of her cargo and put it to use later in the East Africa Campaign.|$|E
25|$|A cartel {{arrived at}} Dover on 30 January 1811 with the 22 survivors. The British sent the Elizabeth cartel from Chatham with 18 French prisoners but <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>approached</b> Calais the {{batteries}} there fired {{on her and}} she returned to Dover on 4 March.|$|E

50|$|In the film, Seaview is {{attacked}} by another submarine <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>approaches</b> the firing point.

The attacking sub is crushed by the pressure when it follows Seaview into the trench.|$|R
50|$|For special effects, Lourié's team {{constructed}} {{two models}} of the modified steamer, a one-to-ten-scale model that was 18 feet (5.5 meters) long, and, for long shots of the Batavia Queen <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>approaches</b> Krakatoa, a one-to-twenty-scale model. The latter proved too small to provide realistic effects, so Lourié chose not {{to use it in}} the film, instead using only the larger model.|$|R
25|$|Her captors sold Kent for 30,900 piastres to a Danish {{shipping}} company, which renamed her Cronberg. She left on 21 March, but <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>approached</b> Denmark passing vessels {{informed her}} that a British fleet had attacked Copenhagen; she therefore waited some weeks in Fleckeroë {{before it was}} safe to proceed to arrive in Kristiansand in June 1801, and at Copenhagen on 16 July.|$|E

To escape the boats of Spencer and , on 16 November Syren ran ashore under Cape May. Her crew set her on fire before making their escape.|$|E
25|$|Following {{shakedown}} training out of California ports, Tunny {{arrived in}} the Hawaiian Islands on 12 December 1942. After an additional week of training and two weeks of availability, she got underway from Submarine Base, Pearl Harbor, on 12 January 1943 for her first war patrol. For nearly a week, rough seas hampered {{the progress of the}} submarine. Then, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>approached</b> the Ryukyu Islands, sea traffic increased. Sightings of sampans became frequent, and Tunny often dove to avoid detection by suspicious-looking trawlers.|$|E

25|$|Donegal: La Trinidad Valencera (1,000 tons, Levant squadron, 360 men, 42 guns) {{had taken}} on more water than could be pumped out. Yet <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>approached</b> the coast she managed to rescue 264 men from the Barca de Amburgo, another ship swamped in the heavy seas. Trinidad {{anchored}} in Glenagivney Bay, where she listed {{to such a degree}} that the order was given to abandon ship. Some locals were paid for the use of a small boat, and over the course of two days all 560 men were ferried to shore.|$|E
25|$|Hinchinbrook left Port Royal, Jamaica on 19 January 1782 {{and almost}} {{immediately}} started to take on water. The next day Markham {{decided to try to}} get to St Anne’s Bay, Jamaica but <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>approached</b> the harbour she stopped responding to the helm and she ran aground on the west reef going into the harbour. Despite numerous efforts, her crew was unable to get her over or off the reef. A schooner came alongside and took off her guns, some stores, and her crew. She then sank that night.|$|E
25|$|On 2 April a Spanish 14-gun brig {{fired on}} Black Joke <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>approached</b> the brig. After {{two hours of}} exchanging shots, and after {{suffering}} several casualties, the brig hoisted a flag of truce. She {{turned out to be}} the Providentia, of 14 guns and a crew of 80 men. She had fired on the Black Joke as Providentias captain had been warned that a Colombian privateer answering to the same description as Black Joke was in the area. Turner therefore released her. Black Joke suffered no casualties; Providentia had numerous of her crew killed and wounded.|$|E

Through their presence the spirit of Thomas Covenant is invoked. Yet he too refuses to give her counsel; he cannot.|$|R
25|$|A {{group of}} hikers were {{walking down the}} trail as Welden was walking up. She {{approached}} them and asked them a few questions about the Long Trail. She continued walking in a northerly direction on the road portion of the trail now known as Harbour Road. Welden was on the Long Trail {{late in the afternoon}} and darkness was falling <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>approached</b> the end of Harbour Road. She may have continued into quickly darkening woods and it was presumed that she must have continued her Long Trail walk along the Bolles Brook valley, although there are no known confirmed sightings of her past the Fay Fuller Camp.|$|E
25|$|Unloading completed, John W. Brown {{left the}} beachhead on 21 August and {{returned}} in convoy to Naples, where she arrived on 23 August. She embarked 500 German prisoners-of-war and 33 U.S. Army personnel to guard them on 3 September 1944, departed Naples in convoy the next day, stopped at Augusta, {{and then left}} in convoy for the United States. Her convoy had a quiet passage except for heavy weather which worsened <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>approached</b> the U.S. East Coast. She arrived at Hampton Roads on 28 September, disembarked the prisoners-of-war at Newport News, Virginia, on 29 September, and then steamed north up the Chesapeake Bay to Baltimore, where she arrived on 30 September 1944 to conclude her fourth voyage.|$|E
25|$|Nimrod sailed from Cork on 13 January 1828 for the Clyde. A gale {{developed}} during the night that damaged her and caused her to take on water. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>approached</b> Anglesey Sparshott decided to take refuge at Holyhead. She {{was able to get}} into the harbour and anchor. The wind changed direction and she lost her anchor and the wind and sea drove her onto a ridge of rocks. By midnight of 14 January it became possible to get a line to shore and get the crew off her. Over the next few days her stores were landed and on 12 February the steamer Harlequin was able to pull her off the rocks. The Navy judged her not worth repairing. She was sold to Rowland Robert & Co. on 22 February for £510. The subsequent court martial acquitted Sparshott, his officers, and men of her loss.|$|E

A wedding is typically accompanied by traditional Tobelorese music, played with gongs and drums and a Cakalele dance is usually performed in front of the bride <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>approaches</b> the groom. Around the time of New Year, Tobelo attracts a number of Yangere groups from all over North Halmahera and perform music and dances.|$|R
50|$|The film {{begins with}} a series of outdoor shots narrated by the filmmaker.

The film continues with a collection of personal stories juxtaposed against discussion and analysis from professionals and academics. Viewers get glimpses of the filmmaker's pregnant form <b>as</b> <b>she</b> travels through the landscape. The film ends with the sight of the filmmaker's child and a quote by bell hooks on shame and the life cycle.|$|R

25|$|While {{cruising}} in {{the company}} of the 36-gun , on 16 April 1797, Pearl helped capture the 24-gun privateer, Incroyable. In March 1798, she sailed for the Leeward Islands via West Africa where on 24 April, she escaped from two French frigates. While passing through the Îles de Los, an archipelago off the coast of Guinea, Pearl discovered an enemy squadron comprising 4 large ships at anchor and a brig under sail. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>approached</b> one of the French frigates hoisted her colours and opened fire. Forced to run between two frigates, Pearl engaged both as she passed then hove to, continuing to fire for a further hour before making off with one, or possibly both frigates in pursuit. The chase continued through the night and all through the following day before Pearl managed to escape, and arrived at Sierra Leone on 27 April, where she was inspected for damage. She had been holed in several places, although all were above the waterline; her foretopgallant yard and fore yard had been shot away and a number of lower shrouds and other rigging had been cut through. In addition two of her carronades had been dismounted, causing the death of one man.|$|E
500|$|Her first {{engagement}} was on 19 December 1757 when, {{in company}} with the 28-gun , she encountered the French privateer Diamond. A contemporary report described the Quebec-built Diamond as [...] "a very fine vessel" [...] of 200 tons burthen, carrying 14 carriage guns and a cargo of furs. Diamond opened fire on Brilliant <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>approached,</b> but before the British could retaliate the French vessel exploded and sank. The detonation was assumed to {{have been caused by}} sparks flying back from the privateer's guns and igniting her powder magazine. Only 24 of Diamonds 70 crew survived the explosion. These men were hauled aboard Brilliant and Coventry as prisoners of war.|$|E
500|$|Suffren {{returned}} to the Dardanelles on 9 January 1915 and became the flagship of the squadron of four French battleships, commanded by Rear-Admiral Émile Guépratte. She bombarded the Turkish fort of Kum Kale, on the Asian side of the strait on 19 February. [...] assisted Suffren by sending firing corrections via radio while [...] provided counter-battery fire to suppress the Ottoman coastal artillery. Late in the day the British pre-dreadnought [...] was bombarding the fort at Orhaniye Tepe on the Asiatic side of the strait and began taking heavy fire <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>approached</b> the fort. The British battlecruiser [...] attempted to suppress the Ottoman coast-defense guns to allow Vengeance to extricate herself, but was unsuccessful. Suffren and Gaulois had to combine their fire with that of Inflexible before Vengeance could successfully withdraw. Suffren fired thirty 305-millimetre shells and 227 164-millimetre shells during the day.|$|E

She still seems to be an afraid little girl and Holtz offers comforts and a lullaby to her, even though he knows his daughter is now dead. He pulls her outside and throws her into the sunlight, where she shows her vampire face before she is destroyed.|$|R
50|$|Nutcracker: The Motion Picture, {{like the}} Stowell-Sendak stage {{production}} {{on which it}} is based, is presented as Clara's coming-of-age story. It depicts Clara's inner conflict and confusion, {{as well as the}} beginning of her sexual awakening, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>approaches</b> adolescence; similar themes occur in many of Sendak's books. The film especially emphasizes the darker aspects of Hoffmann's original story and the significance of dreams and the imagination. The cinematography, by making considerable use of closeups and medium shots, attempts to bring viewers closer to the psychology of the main characters.|$|R
