40|$|Abstract Background Pluchea indica (L.) Less. (Asteraceae) is a {{perennial}} shrub plant with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant medicinal properties. However, the anti-cancer properties of its <b>aqueous</b> <b>extracts</b> {{have not been}} studied. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the anti-proliferation, anti-migration, and pro-apoptotic properties of crude <b>aqueous</b> <b>extracts</b> of P. indica leaf and root on human malignant glioma cancer cells and human cervical cancer cells, and the underlying molecular mechanism. Methods GBM 8401 human glioma cells and HeLa cervical carcinoma cells were treated with various concentrations of crude <b>aqueous</b> <b>extracts</b> of P. indica leaf and root and cancer cell proliferation and viability were measured by cell growth curves, trypan blue exclusions, and the tetrazolium reduction assay. Effects of the crude <b>aqueous</b> <b>extracts</b> on focus formation, migration, and apoptosis of cancer cells were studied as well. The molecular mechanism that contributed to the anti-cancer activities of crude <b>aqueous</b> <b>extracts</b> of P. indica root was also examined using Western blotting analysis. Results Crude <b>aqueous</b> <b>extracts</b> of P. indica leaf and root suppressed proliferation, viability, and migration of GBM 8401 and HeLa cells. Treatment with crude <b>aqueous</b> <b>extracts</b> of P. indica leaf and root for 48 hours resulted in a significant 75 % and 70 % inhibition on proliferation and viability of GBM 8401 and HeLa cancer cells, respectively. Crude <b>aqueous</b> <b>extracts</b> of P. indica root inhibited focus formation and promoted apoptosis of HeLa cells. It was found that phosphorylated-p 53 and p 21 were induced in GBM 8401 and HeLa cells treated with crude <b>aqueous</b> <b>extracts</b> of P. indica root. Expression of phosphorylated-AKT was decreased in HeLa cells treated with crude <b>aqueous</b> <b>extracts</b> of P. indica root. Conclusion The in vitro anti-cancer effects of crude <b>aqueous</b> <b>extracts</b> of P. indica leaf and root indicate that it has sufficient potential to warrant further examination and development as a new anti-cancer agent. </p...|$|R

The con centrations used in the bioassays were 0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 375, 0. 50 and 1. 00 mg· L - 1 for intact cell cultures and 10, 25, 50 and 100 mg · L - 1 for <b>aqueous</b> <b>extracts.</b> Controls with nutritive food were used. The bioassays lasted 72 hours for the <b>aqueous</b> <b>extracts</b> and 96 hours for the intact cell cultures, with measurements of survivorship every day and body length {{at the beginning and}} at the end of the bioassays. Both kinds of samples affected survivorship and growth rate of both Daphnia clones, with the intact cell samples being more effective than <b>aqueous</b> <b>extracts.</b> Regarding survivorship, the clone Itajubá was more sensitive to <b>aqueous</b> <b>extracts</b> than the clone Labtox (LC 50 = 54. 4 and 83. 1 mg· L - 1, respectively). No significant difference was found between clones in the intact cell bioassays. Regarding growth rates, a significant difference was found between clones in both samples.
