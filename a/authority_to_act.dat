5|$|The College of Arms, {{also known}} as the College of Heralds, is a royal {{corporation}} consisting of professional officers of arms, with jurisdiction over England, Wales, Northern Ireland and some Commonwealth realms. The heralds are appointed by the British Sovereign and are delegated <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> on behalf of the Crown in all matters of heraldry, the granting of new coats of arms, genealogical research and the recording of pedigrees. The College is also the official body responsible for matters relating to the flying of flags on land, and it maintains the official registers of flags and other national symbols. Though a part of the Royal Household of the United Kingdom the College is self-financed, unsupported by any public funds.|$|E
5|$|The {{first months}} of Bradbury's {{directorship}} were particularly difficult. He had hoped that Atomic Energy Act of 1946 would be quickly passed by Congress and the wartime Manhattan Project would be superseded by a new, permanent organization. It {{soon became clear that}} this would take more than six months. President Harry S. Truman did not sign the act creating the Atomic Energy Commission into law until 1 August 1946, and it did not become active until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, Groves' legal <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> was limited.|$|E
5|$|Not {{knowing that}} Henry VIII had already {{secretly}} married the pregnant Anne Boleyn, Clement VII decided {{to reach out}} to the monarch by appointing Thomas Cranmer, an outspoken proponent of Henry VIII's annulment, as archbishop of Canterbury. A threatened excommunication was handed down when Cranmer pronounced Henry VIII's marriage null and void; Henry VIII responded by telling Campeggio's vicar general for Salisbury to stop all revenues from his bishopric until further notice. Henry VIII then claimed the <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> on behalf of Campeggio in making various ecclesiastical appointments. The fifth session of the Reformation Parliament deprived Campeggio and Girolamo Ghinucci of their English sees (unless they swore loyalty to the king). Unaware of this statute, two days later on 23 March 1534 Campeggio entered Consistory for the final ruling against annulment.|$|E

5|$|The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff {{position}} that Bostock occupied at {{the outbreak of}} World War II was a new one that initially augmented, and later supplanted, an existing Assistant Chief of the Air Staff role. Unlike the Assistant Chief, the Deputy had the <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> {{in place of the}} Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) if required. This increased status saw Bostock given a place on Australia's Joint Planning Committee. He was the RAAF's delegate to a defence conference in Singapore in October 1940, where the Australian contingent found the local forces ill-prepared for an attack by the Japanese, and recommended significant increases in air capability, both in Australia and the Pacific Islands, to meet the threat. Bostock rose rapidly in rank during this period, becoming acting air commodore on 1June 1940 and substantive air vice marshal on 1October 1941. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1942 New Year Honours.|$|E
5|$|In May 1962, Serong was {{selected}} to lead the 30-man Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) of instructors to South Vietnam. Serong had been appointed by Pollard—with whom he was close friends—and was given <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> unilaterally. He conducted a reconnaissance of South Vietnam in June, and {{the main body of}} the AATTV began arriving in early August. Serong based his headquarters in Saigon; the rest of the team was located at various installations throughout the country. Although the AATTV was mostly involved in training the South Vietnamese forces, a few had been attached to the Combined Studies Division, run by the CIA as a counter-insurgency organisation. Serong later became a counter-insurgency advisor to General Paul Harkins, Commander US MACV, but this relationship ended under Pollard's successor, Lieutenant General John Wilton, who reduced Serong's autonomy while continuing to grant him considerable latitude. In May 1963 Serong accepted an invitation to visit the US Special Warfare School in North Carolina, only informing the Military Board after doing so, and he later visited West Germany to become familiar with intelligence activities there, again without informing Wilton, who reacted angrily after finding out about it from a newspaper report. Meanwhile, in late 1963, Serong started to redeploy members of the team into combat advisory roles, and by February 1964 some officers and NCOs were working with Special Forces teams involved in counter-insurgency operations. Resulting in the first involvement of Australian personnel in combat during the conflict, this was a significant decision; it was retrospectively approved by Wilton, who lifted earlier restrictions on the role of AATTV personnel that had prevented them being involved in combat.|$|E
5|$|OKW {{operations}} chief Alfred Jodl {{was present}} for Hitler's rant, and notified Göring's chief of staff, Karl Koller, {{at a meeting}} a few hours later. Sensing its implications, Koller immediately flew to Berchtesgaden to notify Göring, who feared being accused of treason {{if he tried to}} take power. On the other hand, if he did nothing, he feared being accused of dereliction of duty. After some hesitation, Göring reviewed his copy of the 1941 decree naming him Hitler's successor. It not only placed Göring first in the line of succession, but also stated that, if Hitler ever lost his freedom of action, Göring had complete <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> on Hitler's behalf as his deputy. After conferring with Koller and Hans Lammers, the state secretary of the Reich Chancellery, Göring concluded that, by remaining in Berlin to face certain death, Hitler had incapacitated himself from governing. All agreed that Göring therefore had a clear duty to take power in Hitler's stead. He was also motivated by fears that his rival, Martin Bormann, would seize power upon Hitler's death and would have him killed as a traitor. With this in mind, Göring sent a carefully worded telegram asking Hitler for permission to take over as the leader of Germany, stressing that he would be acting as Hitler's deputy. He added that, if Hitler did not reply by 22:00 that night (23 April), he would assume that Hitler had indeed lost his freedom of action, and would assume leadership of the Reich.|$|E

25|$|Burton {{likewise}} {{held that}} Congress, not the President, possessed {{the power to}} act in emergencies because it had exclusive power to pass legislation. He relied on the language and legislative history of the Taft–Hartley Act to find that Congress had not authorized seizure of plants involved in a labor dispute without express legislative authorization. He hedged, however, on whether the President might, in more extreme circumstances, have <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>act.</b>|$|E
25|$|Expectations are not {{legitimate}} {{when they}} require a public <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> in breach of its statutory duty. This applies {{only when the}} statutory provisions diametrically conflict with the representation. In other words, the statutory provision will render the courts' fulfilment of the expectation impossible. However, a statutory provision which merely permits, but does not compel the public authority to breach the expectation will not necessarily justify any such breach.|$|E

The only kind of bills a President can neither veto nor approve are acts that would change the constitution.|$|E

25|$|The {{administration}} also rejected {{use of the}} statutory procedure provided under Section 18 of the Selective Service Act of 1948 that might have permitted seizure of the industry's steel plants {{on the ground that}} compliance with this procedure was too time-consuming and the outcome of compliance too uncertain. Truman chose not to go to Congress to obtain additional statutory authorization for a seizure of the steel industry for the same reasons. That left invocation of the President's inherent <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> in response to a national emergency.|$|E
25|$|The {{multiplicity}} of opinions {{made it difficult}} to determine just what the Court had decided as to whether and when the President had <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> without Congressional authorization.

25|$|Even {{despite the}} Court's evident lack {{of sympathy for}} the broad claims of {{inherent}} power made by the government, Truman and many other observers expected the Court to uphold his <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> {{in the absence of}} express statutory authorization. Many commentators predicted that the Court would avoid the constitutional question, while others stressed the background that all of the Justices had in the New Deal and Fair Deal, when the powers of the Presidency had expanded greatly, and the past support of Justices such as Black, Reed, Frankfurter, and Douglas for the expansive application of the President's war powers.|$|E

25|$|In 1914, at {{the start}} of the First World War, Kitchener became Secretary of State for War, a Cabinet Minister. One of the few to foresee a long war, lasting for at least three years, and with the <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> {{effectively}} on that perception, he organised the largest volunteer army that Britain had seen, and oversaw a significant expansion of materials production to fight on the Western Front.

25|$|The Act {{seeks to}} give direct effect to the European Convention on Human Rights in {{domestic}} law by enabling claimants {{to bring an}} action in national courts instead of having to take their case before the European Court of Human Rights, as had previously been the case.

In principle, the Act has vertical effect in that it operates only vis-à-vis public bodies and not private parties.
