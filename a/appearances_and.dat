40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a review of}} the psychological literature on LGBT <b>appearance</b> <b>and</b> embodiment. Research on ‘outsider’ perceptions of LGBT <b>appearance</b> <b>and</b> embodiment has focused on the links between perceptions of physical attractiveness and homosexuality, and physical attractiveness and transsexuality, and on the detection of homosexuality from visual cues. ‘Insider’ research has examined LGBT people’s body image, <b>and</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>and</b> adornment practices in non-heterosexual communities. We identify three major limitations of LGBT appearance research: (i) the reliance on a gender inversion model of homosexuality; (ii) the marginalisation of bisexual <b>appearance</b> <b>and</b> embodiment; and (iii) the focus on trans as a diagnostic category and the resulting exclusion of the subjectivities and lived experiences of trans people...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Appearance</b> <b>and</b> Reality is {{considered}} Bradley's most important book. According to Ronald W. Clark, its publication helped to [...] "wrest the philosophical initiative from the Continent." [...] In 1894, {{the work was}} reviewed by J. M. E. McTaggart in Revue de métaphysique et de morale, and Josiah Royce in The Philosophical Review. <b>Appearance</b> <b>and</b> Reality was an early influence on Bertrand Russell, encouraging him to question contemporary dogmas and beliefs. Russell recalled that <b>Appearance</b> <b>and</b> Reality had a profound appeal not only to him but to most of his contemporaries, and that G. F. Stout had stated that Bradley [...] "had done as much as is humanly possible in ontology." [...] While Russell later rejected Bradley's views, he continued to regard <b>Appearance</b> <b>and</b> Reality with [...] "the greatest respect". Richard Wollheim comments that the second edition of <b>Appearance</b> <b>and</b> Reality contains considerable new material, and should be consulted in preference to the original edition. According to the British philosopher Timothy Sprigge, some of Bradley's arguments are famous. Sprigge suggests that Bradley's absolute idealism in some respects received a better presentation in Bradley's subsequent work Essays on Truth and Reality (1914) than in <b>Appearance</b> <b>and</b> Reality. Thomas Mautner comments that Bradley's [...] "bold metaphysics" [...] is presented with [...] "pugnacious verve".|$|R
