The teeth were then stored in artificial saliva for 1 month, after which the amount of aluminium and fluoride released was determined spectrophotometrically. With all materials tested, both aluminium and fluoride were released in all cases.

The distributions of endogenous ions and the absorption kinetics of halide ions were similar in both porcine and human skin models. Fresh skin kept its viability over 24 h in salt-free water, allowing experiments following OECD guidelines. Permeation increased in the order F- < Cl- < Br- < I- for all receptor media and skin samples. Absorption was larger in fresh skin due to the transport through chloride channels or exchangers. Skin absorption experiments of ions in Franz cells rely on working with fresh excised skin (human or porcine) and pure water as receptor fluid.

Recent evidence suggests that this mechanism may be implicated in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD).

Objective: We aimed to investigate in vivo the effect of airway surface dehydration on several CS-induced hallmarks of COPD in mice with airway-specific overexpression of the β-subunit of the epithelial Na+ channel (βENaC). Methods: βENaC-Tg mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were exposed to air or CS for 4 or 8 weeks. Pathological hallmarks of COPD, including goblet cell metaplasia, mucin expression, pulmonary inflammation, lymphoid follicles, emphysema and airway wall remodelling were determined and lung function was measured. Results: Airway surface dehydration in βENaC-Tg mice aggravated CS-induced airway inflammation, mucin expression and destruction of alveolar walls and accelerated the formation of pulmonary lymphoid follicles. Moreover, lung function measurements demonstrated an increased compliance and total lung capacity and a lower resistance and hysteresis in βENaC-Tg mice, compared to WT mice.

Results for water, acetonitrile, cyclohexane, dimethyl sulfoxide, hexanol, N-methyl acetamide, and toluene are presented. We validate our approach by predicting the interfacial surface tensions (IFT—excess surface free energy per unit area) in excellent agreement with the mechanical calculations using Kirkwood–Buff theory. Additionally, we evaluate the temperature dependence of the IFT of water as described by the TIP 4 P/ 2005, SPC/Ew, TIP 3 P, and mW classical water models. We find that the TIP 4 P/ 2005 and SPC/Ew water models do a reasonable job of describing the interfacial thermodynamics; however, the TIP 3 P and mW are quite poor. We find that the underprediction of the experimental IFT at 298 K by these water models results from understructured surface molecules whose binding energies are too weak.

The antioxidants ascorbate and glutathione were found to be largely oxidized after 12 h, suggesting an inability of the recycling process to cope with the stress, In addition, both NaCl and CuSO 4 treatments stimulated the accumulation of the osmolyte proline, Therefore, we conclude that the uptake and accumulation of different types of ions lead to the generation of distinct antioxidant responses in N. plumbaginifolia. status: publishe...|$|E
