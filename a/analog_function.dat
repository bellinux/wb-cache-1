However, the identification of such a system is not carried out because it is difficult and singular in any case. Modifications cannot be computed directly, but will result from an iterative strategy: the closed-loop adaptive control is based on a maximization procedure, requiring little memory and no gradient information.

30|$|The {{dynamic range}} of the signal to be {{processed}} by some certain kinds of radar receivers is very large. For example, the RF signal’s dynamic range of weather radar can be as wide as about 94 to 100  dB [1]. To meet this wide dynamic range requirement, automatic gain control (AGC) in IF stage plays an indispensable role in analog circuitry. With the rapid development and popularization of digital electronic technology, in recent years, to improve performance and simplify system, hardware digitization has long been introduced {{in this area and}} more and more <b>analog</b> <b>function</b> circuits have been replaced with digital ones [2, 3]. Orthogonal demodulation now proceeds digitally with satisfactory performance and the function of amplification of IF stage is actually saved [4, 5]. As ADC is moved further towards radar’s analog front end by employing advanced under-sampling ADC chip, the signal added to AD converter has a large dynamic range because of the absence of AGC function which is originally in the analog circuit, and nonlinear effects caused by the strong signal become apparent. Especially, after the digitization of the signal which has been subjected to nonlinear distortion, the harmonic component of the signal will invade the signal frequency band because of aliasing effect, causing additional distortion.|$|E

Sometimes, that path includes little more than a bandpass filter followed by two mixer/detectors that deliver I and Q signals to the baseband processor. Without the usual IF filter to provide additional selectivity, the performance of the mixer has an even greater effect on the receiver’s ability to reject unwanted signals.
