2500|$|In September 2007, {{reports were}} made that William Danielczyk, {{private equity firm}} head, bundled money for Clinton from Republican Party supporters, {{including}} at least one who claimed that Danielczyk later reimbursed her, a charge Danielczyk denied. The Clinton campaign returned that donation, and said: [...] "These allegations are troubling and we will again <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the individuals solicited by Mr. Danielczyk to affirm that their contributions were given with their own funds." ...|$|E

6000|$|All {{was done}} regularly. The Lord of Whitburn was {{determined}} that no ceremony that could make the wedlock valid should be omitted. The priest, a kind old man, but of peasant birth, and entirely subservient to the Dacres, proceeded to <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the pair when they had been assoiled, namely, absolved. Grisell, as he well knew, had been shriven only last Friday; Leonard muttered, [...] "Three days since, when I was dubbed knight, ere the battle." ...|$|E
6000|$|Good Heavens, {{from the}} wisest Thought {{of a man}} to the actual truth of a Thing as it lies in Nature, there is, one would suppose, a {{sufficient}} interval! Consider it,--and what other intervals we introduce! The faithfulest, most glowing word of a man is but an imperfect image of the thought, such as it is, that dwells within him; his best word will never but with error convey his thought to other minds: and then between his poor thought and Nature's Fact, which is the Thought of the Eternal, there may be supposed to lie some discrepancies, some shortcomings! Speak your sincerest, think your wisest, {{there is still a}} great gulf between you and the fact. And now, do not speak your sincerest, and what will inevitably follow out of that, do not think your wisest, but think only your plausiblest, your showiest for parliamentary purposes, where will you land with that guidance?--I invite the British Parliament, and all the Parliamentary and other Electors of Great Britain, to reflect on this till they have well understood it; and then to <b>ask,</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> himself, What probably the horoscopes of the British Parliament, at this epoch of World-History, may be?-- ...|$|E

50|$|D. Each query {{answered}} by partner i involves at most two new endpoints, so {{it increases the}} number of landmarks of i by at most 2. Hence, in the case described by paragraph C, the algorithm must <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> n/2 partners, at least n/4 queries. The total number of queries is thus at least n2/8 = Ω(n2).|$|E
50|$|During {{the night}} a dwarf appears and <b>asks</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the heroes {{if he can}} take a sip from the pot of soup the old woman was cooking. All but the Kalevide allow him to and he {{proceeds}} to drink the whole pot, grow to the sky then vanish.|$|R

5000|$|So, crowd funding {{helped him}} to raise funds using various social {{networking}} sites and personal contacts. [...] "I would send e-mails about the project to all my contacts and <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> them to forward it to all theirs.

[...] Let us earn the right not to blush, but be proud of our existence abroad. As being temporarily deprived of our Motherland let us save in our ranks not only faith in her, but an unbending desire towards feats, sacrifice, and the establishment of a united friendly family of those who did not let down their hands in the fight for her liberation ...|$|E
5000|$|Talkin' Backwords! (Season 3 and UK) - Chudd Chudders {{goes around}} the quizblock and <b>asks</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the contestants a {{question}} in turn; {{but they have to}} give their answer back to front.

60|$|The old men nodded gravely, {{though their}} weazened eye-slits widened with wonder that any woman should be worth such a price. The one that bled {{at the mouth}} wiped his lips. “Is it true talk?” he <b>asked</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> Porportuk’s six young men. And each {{answered}} that it was true.|$|R
50|$|According to Forsyth (2006), {{there are}} three major {{mediation}} approaches:Inquisitorial procedure- Using this procedure, the mediator <b>asks</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the disputants a series of questions, considers {{the two sets of}} responses, and then selects and imposes a mandatory solution on the members. The inquisitorial procedure is the least popular approach to mediation.|$|R
50|$|However, the {{two main}} contestants are always given an {{opportunity}} to answer first if they ring in, even if it is later than the spoiler. This results in a five-way system in which the order of ringing in is displayed on the front of each podium, 1 or 2 on the main contestant's podiums, and 1, 2, or 3 on the spoilers'. Should all five players ring in on a question, the host can <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the main contestants for an answer in the order they rang in before moving on to the spoilers in the order they rang in (should no one provide the correct answer) by using the numbers on the podiums.|$|E
50|$|If {{there is}} a tie for the {{championship}} round or third place, {{there will be an}} elimination round. For example, if four players are left and three make their second mistake, the fourth advances to the championship round and the other three enter the tiebreaker. The moderator will then <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the three players, at the same time, to write their answers to the same question. In this special round, questions can be repeated by players but they cannot ask how to spell the given word. As a result, if one of three responses are correct, he or she will rise to the championship round and the other two will move to the tiebreaker round until a third-place winner determined.|$|E
50|$|Pocket is {{the royal}} fool {{at the court}} of King Lear of Britain. To prevent Lear from marrying off his {{daughter}} Cordelia, a girl Pocket is especially fond of, he schemes with Edmund of Gloucester. Pocket advises the bastard (i.e., illegitimate) Edmund how to take the land of his legitimate brother Edgar, while Edmund is to prevent the marriage of Cordelia. Edmund somehow gets Lear to <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> his three daughters - Goneril, Regan and Cordelia - how much they love him. While Goneril and Regan please the old king with their exaggerations, Cordelia enraged him with her famous laconic “I love thee, according to my bond.” Lear disinherits Cordelia and divides his kingdom between Goneril and Regan. Notwithstanding, the prince of France marries Cordelia and takes her with him.|$|E
5000|$|Director Jim Jarmusch {{generated}} the wording {{in the pink}} letter by <b>asking</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the four female leads to write {{a version of the}} letter {{from the point of view}} of their respective characters.

5000|$|Yet, {{when the}} Plataean prisoners were {{brought before the}} judges, no trial was held; no chance for apology was offered.

50|$|Chris Harrison <b>asked</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> {{the couples}} {{to have a}} serious talk {{with each other and}} decide whether to {{continue}} or go home. AshLee and Graham decided to split up after some prompting by Michelle. Zack, Jackie, Tasos and Christy all decided to break up. That left three couples: Sarah and Robert, Michelle and Cody, and Lacy and Marcus.|$|R
50|$|There {{was some}} {{concern that the}} {{children}} involved in the study would only see their Halloween costumes and not their own self reflections, so a second condition was performed in Beaman, Diener, and Svanum’s experiment. This second condition was called individuation manipulation. The individuation manipulation condition was performed {{in the same way}} as the self-awareness manipulation. After greeting the children the woman at the door would <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the children their name and where he or she lived. These questions were asked in such a way that the children would think nothing of it because many other homes asked the children their names on Halloween night; however, no effort was made to identify the children involved. Just as in the first condition, a mirror was used half of the time and was removed for the other half of the experiment.|$|E
50|$|Mulhern picks three contestants {{out of the}} audience, who {{are wearing}} flashy outfits {{in an attempt to}} be noticed by Mulhern. He will then pick a fourth. The fourth will then be posed three {{questions}} and will <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the three players for one answer. One of the podiums is loaded with a prize such as a holiday, white goods or a vehicle, and that player has the answers in front of them. The other two will have to make up their answers. If the fourth player can pick the correct podium, (s)he will win that prize. Whichever player is picked wins £1,000 and is replaced; contestants who are picked and manage to bluff their way to being picked are offered a gamble: £1,000 and that prize if they can identify who was correct. All contestants who are picked automatically take home a Pick Me! shirt. This process repeats itself four times, involving ten contestants in total.|$|E
5000|$|Marira {{was known}} to produce {{hardcore}} criminals at school, but during the 1980s, Solomon A.A. Manthonsi, the late headmaster of Vungwi Primary School helped to instil some disciplines at school. Like any other rural population {{in the country and}} worldwide, it is poorly educated but of late we have seen educated professionals coming out. This is to support what was once said by Nelson Mandela that only education can turn the child of a peasant farmer into a medical doctor. Of late they been medical doctors, engineers, chartered accountants, teachers, nurses coming out of this poor rural community. When you <b>ask</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> them, they have the same answer... "It is by the grace of God". Education has been the pillar of growth to these families of great note has been the Chimusoros, Dovos with the biggest number of professionals, {{and the rest of the}} families have one or two professionals per family.|$|E
