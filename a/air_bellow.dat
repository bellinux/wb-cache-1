Four project reports serve as examples to characterize the typical approaches the institute is offering in more detail: H. Oppermann discusses in his contribution "Improvement of the accuracy of analytical life prediction for metal components considering loading sequence effects" the influence of the order of load events on the fatigue process. As a result, characteristic functions - depending on the shape of specimen and load - are derived and integrated into an existing procedure for life prediction. Subject of the paper "Static and dynamic behavior of elastomer components under large deformations" by U. -J. Görke are various phenomena which are typical for elastomers, th e experimental identification of material parameters for appropriate material models and their implementation in finite element codes. A life prediction method is briefly outlined based on a combination of experimental results of test specimens under oscillating loads and finite element calculations. G. Fischer and V. Grubisic deal with a procedure to derive artificial load sequences based on service measurements of commercial vehicles. These loads are used in a test rig to simulate realistic stresses and strains in the <b>air</b> <b>bellow</b> of pneumatic suspension systems. Finally, H. Kaufmann and C. M. Sonsino in a contribution "Accuracy of life prediction of a steering knuckle based on a local stress concept" discuss divergent results of numerical life time predictions of a real steering knuckle under operational loading, using several state-of-the-art procedures based on results from specimens testing. None of the 6 investigated methods led to a sufficient quality of the prediction, so that t he authors recommend to apply those methods only for predimensioning purposes and to carry out experiments, if heavy oversizing has to be avoided...|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the primary suspension of rubber chevron spring and oil dampers, secondary suspension is provided by two <b>air</b> <b>bellows</b> per bogie - flow into each bellows is controlled independently by a levelling valve and arm assembly that allows the suspension to inflate/deflate when {{the weight of the}} coach is increased or decreased by passenger loading.

50|$|Racing engines {{often fail}} at high {{rotational}} speeds because mechanical springs {{are unable to}} retract the valves quickly enough to provide clearance for the piston. Renault's pneumatic valve technology replaced steel springs with light weight compressed <b>air</b> <b>bellows.</b> These could retract valves more quickly and reduce the possibility of piston-valve interference, as long as pressure could be maintained. Additionally, the amount of seat tension required to keep a coil sprung valve under control results in greater peak lift loading, with added stress to the entire valvetrain as a result. Pneumatic systems, sharing a common reservoir of pressure retain a more static level of force, controlling the valve effectively, without any attendant peak lift load increase.|$|R

These couplings are able to change torsional stiffness by changing pressure in their flexible elements – <b>air</b> <b>bellows.</b> Until now we have dealt with the use of pneumatic flexible shaft couplings for tuning mechanical systems working with periodically alternating load torque at steady state. Some mechanical systems, however, operate with a static load torque at constant speed (e. g. hoists, elevators, etc.), where it is necessary to consider the suitability of shaft coupling in terms of load torque at transient conditions (run-up and braking). Therefore we decided to analyze the use of pneumatic flexible shaft couplings also in this type of mechanical systems on an example of conveyor belt drive...|$|R

40|$|In {{almost any}} medical {{procedure}} respiratory motion {{is an issue}} and may result in image degradation. Most currently available devices and systems, which are intended to reduce respiratory influences do not come into operation however in clinics due to their high cost and complex operation. In our paper we evaluated an interactive breath hold control system that helps flat breathing to subsequently reduce respiratory motion during signal acquisitions or procedure treatments. With that the human subjects are enabled to regulate their own breath by following visual feedback via a specially designed display. That display shows biofeedback information about the respiratory excursion through air pressure deviations measured inside an <b>air</b> <b>bellows</b> belt. The system was assessed quantitatively in a laboratory setup and qualitatively by applications in real clinical procedures. The obtained results are very promising and can be further improved with additional developments to provide an {{easy to use and}} relatively inexpensive solution for respiratory motion related imaging problems...|$|R

40|$|The load {{elongation}} behaviour of geotextiles is decisively {{influenced by the}} surrounding soil. This influence on behaviour has previously been quantifiable only insufficiently and cannot therefore be used in current dimensioning procedures. This uncertainty leads to low coefficients of utilisation of the geotextiles in the dimensioning procedures and thus to constructions which cannot be evaluated in terms of safety and which are often not economical. With the laboratory tests 'lateral pressure device' and 'transverse force introduction', the bond behaviour of geotextiles with the surrounding soil was realistically simulated and studied. These tests provided input parameters for calculations using the finite element method (FEM). Lateral pressure devices were used to study the {{load elongation}} behaviour of geotextiles in contact with soil. These test devices {{make it possible to}} apply a tensile load to the geotextiles in the soil. The geotextile sample is fastened on two clamps; one end is held in place. At the other end the tensile force is introduced. Vertically to the geotextile level, soil layers and compressed <b>air</b> <b>bellows</b> are installed. These compressed <b>air</b> <b>bellows</b> are used to simulate the load in the construction. In the tests, various geotextile products (mechanically bonded fabrics, thermally bonded fabric, woven textile) were studied. Two different types of soil (fine gravel and coarse clay) were used. The influence of the type of soil and the soil load on the load elongation behaviour were studied. The tests showed that the deformation behaviour of the geotextiles studies is decisively characterised by the soil. The deformation module of the geotextile samples is clearly higher in the bond with the soil than in the tests without contact to the soil. This is caused by the transmission of transverse strain between soil and geotextile and by the dispersion of soil particles {{in the structure of the}} geotextiles. Thus an inner bond arises. The raw material of the geotextiles had a clear influence on the deformation behaviour. The tests showed that exceptional suitability of polyester as a reinforcement material. The transverse movement test is a modified shear test in which a geotextile reinforcement is also installed in addition to the soil material. The reinforcement is perpendicular arranged in relation to the shear joint. This test construction is used to simulate the behaviour of the geotextile/soil/bond system in the proximity of the fracture joint in reinforced steep slopes which is formed when the shear strength of the soil material is exceeded. The deformation of the geotextile which occurs under this transverse force load causes an increase in the resistance to shearing and thus an increase of the ultimate load of these bond systems. On the basis of the results of this research study, it is possible to give a plausible explanation for the good success with geotextiles as reinforcement of earthworks. This success could not be comprehended, in particular for the non wovens, from the tests without soil, the results of which are included in the current dimensioning approaches. The results of this research study can, therefore, serve as the basis for a dimensioning approach which realistically records the influence of the soil and the deformations of the bond system.
