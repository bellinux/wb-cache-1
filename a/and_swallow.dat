5|$|Halfbeaks carry several {{adaptations to}} feeding {{at the water}} surface. The eyes and {{nostrils}} {{are at the top}} of the head and the upper jaw is mobile, but not the lower jaw. Combined with their streamlined shape and the concentration of fins towards the back (similar to that of a pike), these adaptations allow halfbeaks to locate, catch, <b>and</b> <b>swallow</b> food items very effectively.|$|E
5|$|Under each foreleg, the {{sea otter}} has a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest. In this pouch (preferentially the left one), the animal stores {{collected}} food {{to bring to}} the surface. This pouch also holds a rock, unique to the otter, that is used to break open shellfish and clams. There, the sea otter eats while floating on its back, using its forepaws to tear food apart and bring it to its mouth. It can chew <b>and</b> <b>swallow</b> small mussels with their shells, whereas large mussel shells may be twisted apart. It uses its lower incisor teeth to access the meat in shellfish.|$|E
5|$|The basal ganglia—the part of {{the brain}} most {{prominently}} affected in early HD—play a key role in movement and behavior control. Their functions are not fully understood, but current theories propose that they are {{part of the}} cognitive executive system and the motor circuit. The basal ganglia ordinarily inhibit a large number of circuits that generate specific movements. To initiate a particular movement, the cerebral cortex sends a signal to the basal ganglia that causes the inhibition to be released. Damage to the basal ganglia can cause the release or reinstatement of the inhibitions to be erratic and uncontrolled, which results in an awkward start to motion or motions to be unintentionally initiated, or a motion to be halted before, or beyond, its intended completion. The accumulating damage to this area causes the characteristic erratic movements associated with HD. The spontaneous and erratic physical movements associated with HD are classified as a type of hyperkinetic dysarthria. Because of the basal ganglia's inability to inhibit movements, individuals affected by it will inevitably experience a reduced ability to produce speech <b>and</b> <b>swallow</b> foods and liquids (dysphagia).|$|E
40|$|Children with {{neurological}} disabilities {{frequently have}} problems with feeding <b>and</b> <b>swallowing.</b> Such problems {{have a significant impact}} on the health and well-being of these children and their families. The primary aims in the rehabilitation of pediatric feeding <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> disorders are focused on supporting growth, nutrition and hydration, the development of feeding activities, <b>and</b> ensuring safe <b>swallowing</b> with the aim of preventing choking and aspiration pneumonia. Pediatric feeding <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> disorders can be divided into four groups: transient, developmental, chronic or progressive. This article provides an overview of the available literature about the rehabilitation of feeding <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> disorders in infants and children. Principles of motor control, motor learning and neuroplasticity are discussed for the four groups of children with feeding <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> disorders...|$|R

5|$|The {{difference}} between teleosts and other bony fish lies mainly in their jaw bones; teleosts have a movable premaxilla and corresponding modifications {{in the jaw}} musculature which {{make it possible for}} them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth. This is of great advantage, enabling them to grab prey and draw it into the mouth. In more derived teleosts, the enlarged premaxilla is the main tooth-bearing bone, and the maxilla, which is attached to the lower jaw, acts as a lever, pushing and pulling the premaxilla as the mouth is opened and closed. Other bones further back in the mouth serve to grind <b>and</b> <b>swallow</b> food. Another difference is that the upper and lower lobes of the tail (caudal) fin are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, distinguishing this group from other fish in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the tail fin.|$|E
5|$|When {{the news}} of the Ortega's defeat reached the Governor-General, better-armed {{reinforcements}} from Manila were sent to Tayabas. On November 1, 1841, Col. Joaquín Huet arrived in Tayabas with 800 to 1,000 soldiers. They initially offered government amnesty to the cofradía with the exception of Hermano Pule and other senior leaders, but the cofradía refused. Prior to Colonel Huet's arrival, Pule and the cofradía leaders promised their followers of victory through divine intervention. The cofradía fighters were made to believe that they were invulnerable to enemy bullets, and that angels from Heaven would come down and help them in battle, and finally the ground would open up <b>and</b> <b>swallow</b> the enemy troops. The battle between the cofradía and the government forces lasted for four hours. Three hundred to five hundred men, women, elders, and children were killed on the cofradía side. Afterwards, 500 were taken prisoner, including 300 women. The rest of the cofradía escaped to the forests and were not pursued. Only 11 were wounded on the government's side.|$|E
5|$|While on Müller's trail, {{he happens}} to meet his old friend, the Portuguese {{merchant}} Oliveira da Figueira. With Figueira's help, Tintin enters Müller's house and knocks the criminal unconscious. He finds the prince, who is imprisoned in a dungeon, and rescues him as Haddock arrives with the authorities. Müller is revealed to be the agent of a foreign power responsible for the tampering of the fuel supplies, having invented a type of chemical in tablet form, which {{goes by the name}} Formula 14, that increases the explosive power of oil by a significant amount. Thomson and Thompson find the tablets <b>and</b> <b>swallow</b> them, thinking them to be aspirin, causing them to grow long hair and beards that change colour. After analysing the tablets, Professor Calculus develops an antidote for Thomson and Thompson and a means of countering the affected oil supplies.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Early {{stages of}} oral submucous {{fibrosis}} {{may lead to}} masticatory <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> impairments. This study was, conducted to evaluate the masticatory <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> functions {{in a group of}} oral submucous fibrosis patients. Patients and Methods: Masticatory <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> performance, maximum bite force, oral stereognosis, and surface electromyographic activity of the buccinator muscle were measured in 11 patients with early oral submucous fibrosis and controls matched for age and gender. Results: Statistical analysis revealed that {{there was no significant difference}} in maximum bite force between controls and patients with oral submucous fibrosis. However, the masticatory <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> performance, integrated surface electromyographic activity during maximum blowing in right buccinator, and oral stereognostic score in the oral submucous fibrosis group were significantly lower than in the control group. Conclusion: These findings suggest that patients with early oral submucous fibrosis may exhibit impaired masticatory <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> functions along with reduced oral stereognosis and buccinator muscle activity...|$|R

40|$|The {{case of a}} 68 -year-old {{woman with}} {{postoperative}} speech <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> problems following a circumferential pharyngolaryngectomy and neopharyngeal reconstruction with a jejunal free flap is presented. The primary tumor was an extended papillary thyroid carcinoma (pT 4 N 0 M 0). For vocal restoration, an indwelling Provox(®) 1 voice prosthesis was inserted secondarily. The patient received speech <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> therapy, including digital maneuvers {{at the level of}} the proximal (cervical) part of the jejunal graft to improve speech <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> function.

40|$|SummaryThe {{pathways}} for air {{and food}} cross in the pharynx. In breathing, air may flow through either the nose or the mouth; it always {{flows through the}} pharynx. During swallowing, the pharynx changes from an airway to a food channel. The pharynx is isolated from the nasal cavity and lower airway by velopharyngeal and laryngeal closure during the pharyngeal swallow. During mastication, the food bolus accumulates in the pharynx prior to swallow initiation. The structures in the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx serve multiple functions in breathing, speaking, mastication <b>and</b> <b>swallowing.</b> Thus, the fine temporal coordination of feeding among breathing, mastication <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> is essential to provide proper food nutrition and to prevent pulmonary aspiration. This review paper will review the temporo-spatial coordination of the movements of oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal structures during mastication <b>and</b> <b>swallowing,</b> <b>and</b> temporal coordination between breathing, mastication, <b>and</b> <b>swallowing...</b>|$|R
