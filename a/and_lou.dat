30|$|At present, {{determining}} optimal {{trade credit}} period is being {{more and more}} attention from researchers. There are two main research views, one is trade credit provider perspective, and other is game perspective. From trade credit provider perspective, for instance, <b>Lou</b> <b>and</b> Wang (2012) extended Teng <b>and</b> <b>Lou’s</b> model (2012) to establish an EOQ model to derive optimal trade credit period and lot size simultaneously. But, in their model, they didn’t concern the retailer’s benefit and an additional capital opportunity cost the supplier burdens for offering trade credit. Recently, Teng et al. (2014) extended <b>Lou</b> <b>and</b> Wang’s model (2012) to consider learning curve phenomenon {{and the loss of}} capital opportunity during the delay payment period. Dye and Yang (2015) further extended <b>Lou</b> <b>and</b> Wang’s model (2012) to include cases with partial backorder and the supplier’s opportunity cost and two carbon emission constraints. Chen and Teng (2015) recently extended Teng <b>and</b> <b>Lou’s</b> model (2012) to consider time-varying deteriorating items and default risk rates under two levels of trade credit by discounted cash flow analysis. Other prominent and latest works include those by Wang et al. (2014), Wu et al. (2014), and Shah and Cárdenas-Barrón (2015), among others.|$|R

5|$|Some {{critics have}} {{compared}} 30 Rock to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, with parallels drawn between {{the relationship of}} Liz and Jack and that of Mary Richards <b>and</b> <b>Lou</b> Grant.

Like That Girl and Mary Tyler Moore, 30 Rock is a sitcom centering on an unmarried, brunette career woman living {{in a big city}} where she works in the television industry. That Girl was parodied in the opening segment of 30 Rocks pilot.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of Dr. Marvin Monroe and Itchy & Scratchy; the latter had previously appeared in the shorts.

30|$|Our work in {{this paper}} is mainly {{motivated}} by an open problem raised by <b>Lou</b> <b>and</b> Lutscher [5]. <b>Lou</b> <b>and</b> Lutscher [5] conjectured that there may exist an optimal intermediate diffusion rate d̃ so that a species adopting d̃ will replace its competitor with a different diffusion rate. Obviously, if the optimal rate d̃ does exist, then it must be in our living interval (d, d). Some further work is necessary to solve <b>Lou</b> <b>and</b> Lutscher’s original conjecture.|$|R
