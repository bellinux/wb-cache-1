5|$|Sebastian Vettel led a Ferrari 1-2 {{in third}} {{practice}} ahead of Räikkönen, setting {{a time of}} 1:31.683. The two Mercedes drivers of Rosberg and Hamilton followed, ahead of Valtteri Bottas and Romain Grosjean. On the soft compound tyres, both Mercedes drivers had set identical times, before Rosberg edged out Hamilton on the super-softs. Higher temperatures in the <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> meant that the times dropped from second practice. Felipe Massa ran a new, shorter nase for Williams, but managed only the ninth fastest time, {{more than half a}} second slower than teammate Bottas. Not running the super-soft tyres, Toro Rosso got its two drivers on 15th and 16th place respectively. Jolyon Palmer was 20th fastest before puncturing a tyre {{at the end of the}} session.|$|E

25|$|The {{rectangular}} {{central area}} of the cricket field – the space used for pitches – {{is known as the}} square. Cricket pitches are usually oriented as close to the north-south direction as practical, because the low <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> would be dangerous for a batsman facing due west.|$|E
25|$|With {{the strong}} September <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> shining {{directly}} into his eyes, without any opposition (with the goal umpire crouching {{in a perfect}} position to determine its legality), he first caught the ball perhaps ten {{feet above the ground}} (3m), right on the goal line, to turn Geelong away, and retain Richmond’s lead of ten points. He played on, and his clearing drop-kick almost hit the centre.|$|E
25|$|Notable {{examples}} of this movement appear in Maclaine Pont's design for the ceremonial halls of the Technische Hoogeschool te Bandung (which became Institut Teknologi Bandung). The building features an eclectic synthesis of various Indonesian local forms, including the architecture of Lake Toba, the Mentawai islands, and Sunda. The building is a striking example of innovative tropical architecture. With an elongated elevation aligned on an east-west axis, the building is provided with effective natural ventilation. This orientation also minimizes the effect of solar radiation in that the morning and <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> only strikes the narrow end facades of the building. The external galleries of the building create a double facade which shield the interior from direct sunlight, while cooling towers at either end ensure good ventilation.|$|E

500|$|The Yankees' {{status as}} tenants of the Giants at the Polo Grounds had become {{increasingly}} uneasy, and in 1922, Giants owner Charles Stoneham {{stated that the}} Yankees' lease, expiring after that season, would not be renewed. Ruppert and Huston had long contemplated a new stadium, and had taken an option on property at 161st Street and River Avenue in the Bronx. Yankee Stadium was completed {{in time for the}} home opener on April 18, 1923, at which the Babe hit the first home run in what was quickly dubbed [...] "the House that Ruth Built". The ballpark was designed with Ruth in mind: although the venue's left-field fence was further from home plate than at the Polo Grounds, Yankee Stadium's right-field fence was closer, making home runs easier to hit for left-handed batters. To spare Ruth's eyes, right field–his defensive position–was not pointed into the <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun,</b> as was traditional; left fielder Meusel was soon suffering headaches from squinting toward home plate.|$|E
500|$|Torrez {{was removed}} from the game after walking Mickey Rivers. [...] Reliever Bob Stanley came in, and after Rivers stole second Thurman Munson drove him in with a double. In the eighth inning, a home run by Reggie Jackson made the score 5–2 in favor of the Yankees. [...] The Red Sox cut New York's lead to just one run {{in the bottom of the}} eighth against closer Goose Gossage on RBI singles by Fred Lynn and Yastrzemski. [...] But the Yankees would hold off the Red Sox, thanks in part to a heads-up {{defensive}} play by right fielder Lou Piniella with one out in the bottom of the ninth. [...] With Burleson on first base, Jerry Remy hit a line drive to Piniella in right field, but Piniella was blinded by the late <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> and could not see the ball. However, he pretended to field the play normally, pounding his glove as though he would easily catch the ball. [...] This prevented Burleson from advancing to third base. [...] When Jim Rice followed with a deep fly to the outfield, Burleson could only move up to third base instead of scoring the tying run.|$|E
2500|$|Al Lang Stadium's {{grandstand}} {{faces the}} southeast, giving almost every seat {{a view of}} the St. Petersburg harbor and Tampa Bay beyond the left field wall. The stadium is constructed primarily of reinforced concrete, and the public portions of the facility include very few enclosed and air conditioned areas. A unique concrete cantilevered overhang shades many of the grandstand seats from the <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun,</b> and the stadium's waterfront location is often cooled by a sea breeze. During the 2015 renovation, the Rowdies replaced all of the seats in the grandstand, refreshed fan areas under the grandstand, and extensively updated many of the club and gameday operation areas. In addition, a portion of the outfield wall was removed and two banks of uncovered bleachers installed in its place, adding several hundred seats on the sideline of the soccer pitch opposite the grandstand.|$|E
