25|$|The {{presence}} of such pits contemporaneously with the burial {{of women and}} children under the floors of houses suggests a multiplicity of religious convictions, as does the use of both cremation and inhumation.

25|$|In {{addition}} to Structure A, other structures were found around the site. It {{is important to}} point out that according to Purépecha architectonic tradition, temples and their foundations <b>always</b> <b>were</b> built on top of natural hills, over an artificial platform, or, as in the Huandacareo case, over platforms and plazas, for this purpose they built retention walls embedded to the mountain slopes.|$|E

The black church established and/or maintained the first black schools and encouraged community members to fund these schools and other public services. For most black leaders, the churches <b>always</b> <b>were</b> connected to political goals of advancing the race. There grew to be a tension between black leaders from the North and people in the South who wanted to run their churches and worship in their own way.|$|E

500|$|Most of the album's lyrics {{were written}} by Static, from the R band Playa. While the band was growing apart, he was invited by Blackground to be a lead writer for the album after writing [...] "Are You That Somebody?" [...] and [...] "Try Again". Static {{was a part of}} Aaliyah's close group of friends, which {{included}} Missy Elliott and Timbaland, and shared an infatuation with her. He found Aaliyah to be ideal for his songwriting style, while she believed that he could accurately portray her feelings. A subtly sexual lyricist, he wrote [...] "Rock the Boat" [...] for her in 1999, but Blackground felt she was not ready for the song. Barry Hankerson said of his songwriting, [...] "We <b>always</b> <b>were</b> protective over every lyric... But he did things where you never felt offended. You just felt like you overheard someone thinking... he was clever... Aaliyah depended on him [...] he depended on her." [...] Elliott said that he was [...] "a part of that bridge of Aaliyah growing up lyrically". While she discussed the lyrics with Static, Aaliyah consulted Bud'da about the sound and musical direction of the album. She was interested in learning about the UK garage scene at the time.|$|E

Tickets <b>always</b> <b>were</b> tough to come by. The reason the final curtain came down Saturday was because, being a production by the Roundabout Theatre Company – a subscription-based 'not-for-profit' theater company – it was presented under special Equity terms, with its actors paid a minimal fee. To extend the show, it would have been necessary to negotiate new contracts with the entire company ... because of the Belasco's limited seating, it wasn't deemed financially feasible to do so." ...|$|E
2500|$|Until recently, most reviews {{indicated}} that Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were always scarce on the Russian River. However, in 2007, the Sonoma County Water Agency completed a comprehensive re-evaluation of historical records, {{coupled with a}} 5-year monitoring program using underwater cameras at two fish ladders just north of Forestville. They found that Chinook <b>always</b> <b>were,</b> and still are, [...] "a relatively abundant, widely distributed, and naturally self-sustaining population". The authors found historic information dating to 1881 suggesting {{the presence of an}} ancestral population, and their genetic analysis found the Chinook both above and below barriers to fish passage to be of native, and not hatchery stock.|$|E

2500|$|A {{dominant}} {{theme in}} One Hundred Years of Solitude is the inevitable and inescapable repetition {{of history in}} Macondo. The protagonists are controlled by their pasts and the complexity of time. Throughout the novel the characters are visited by ghosts. [...] "The ghosts are symbols {{of the past and}} the haunting nature it has over Macondo. The ghosts and the displaced repetition that they evoke are, in fact, firmly grounded in the particular development of Latin American history". [...] "Ideological transfiguration ensured that Macondo and the Buendías <b>always</b> <b>were</b> ghosts to some extent, alienated and estranged from their own history, not only victims of the harsh reality of dependence and underdevelopment but also of the ideological illusions that haunt and reinforce such social conditions." ...|$|E
2500|$|The scarab was {{of prime}} {{significance}} in the funerary cult of ancient Egypt. Scarabs, generally, though not <b>always,</b> <b>were</b> cut from green stone, and placed on the chest of the deceased. Perhaps the most famous example of such [...] "heart scarabs" [...] is the yellow-green pectoral scarab found among the entombed provisions of Tutankhamen. It was carved from {{a large piece of}} Libyan desert glass. The purpose of the [...] "heart scarab" [...] was to ensure that the heart would not bear witness against the deceased at judgement in the Afterlife. Other possibilities are suggested by the [...] "transformation spells" [...] of the Coffin Texts, which affirm that the soul of the deceased may transform (xpr) into a human being, a god, or a bird and reappear {{in the world of the}} living.|$|E
2500|$|Before colonization, many Indigenous {{communities}} {{experienced a}} type of equality between the sexes that was not practiced by European colonizers. In many Indigenous societies, women {{played a crucial role}} in community life and they often, although not <b>always,</b> <b>were</b> afforded [...] "religious, political, and economic power- not more than men but at least equal to men." [...] Indigenous feminism attributes modern-day gendering of indigenous issues to colonization through naming, claiming, and exploiting native people. Sandy Grande further explains how colonizing and decolonizing need to be understood simultaneously in her piece titled [...] "Whitestream Feminism and the Colonialist Project: A Review of Contemporary Feminist Pedagogy and Praxis". She says, [...] "the project of decolonization begins with the understanding that the collective oppression of indigenous women results primarily from colonialism- a multidimensional force underwritten by Western Christianity, defined by white supremacy, and fueled by global capitalism." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Pythia {{would then}} bathe {{naked in the}} Castalian Spring then would drink the holier waters of the Cassotis, which flowed closer to the temple, where a naiad {{possessing}} magical powers was said to live. Euripides described this ritual purification ceremony, starting first with the priest Ion dancing on the highest point of Mount Parnassus, going about his duties within the temple, and sprinkling the temple floor with holy water. The purification ceremonies <b>always</b> <b>were</b> performed on the seventh day of the month, which was sacred to and associated with the god Apollo. [...] Then escorted by the Hosioi, an aristocratic council of five, with a crowd of oracular servants, they would arrive at the temple. [...] Consultants, carrying laurel branches sacred to Apollo, approached the temple along the winding upward course of the Sacred Way, bringing a young goat kid for sacrifice in the forecourt of the temple, and a monetary fee.|$|E
2500|$|Groucho {{maintained}} his irrepressible {{sense of humor}} to the very end, however. [...] George Fenneman, his radio and TV announcer, good-natured foil, and lifelong friend, often related a story {{of one of his}} final visits to Groucho's home: When the time came to end the visit, Fenneman lifted Groucho from his wheelchair, put his arms around his torso, and began to [...] "walk" [...] the frail comedian backwards across the room towards his bed. As he did, he heard a weak voice in his ear: [...] "Fenneman," [...] whispered Groucho, [...] "you <b>always</b> <b>were</b> a lousy dancer." [...] When a nurse approached him with a thermometer during his final hospitalization, explaining that she wanted to see if he had a temperature, he responded, [...] "Don't be silly—everybody has a temperature." [...] Actor Elliott Gould recalled a similar incident: [...] "I recall the last time I saw Groucho, he was in the hospital, and he had tubes in his nose and what have you," [...] he said. [...] "And when he saw me, he was weak, but he was there; and he put his fingers on the tubes and played them like it was a clarinet. Groucho played the tubes for me, which brings me to tears." ...|$|E
