5|$|The {{size and}} unique history of Texas make its {{regional}} affiliation debatable; {{it can be}} fairly considered a Southern or a Southwestern state, or both. The vast geographic, economic, <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>diversity</b> within the state itself prohibits easy categorization of the whole state into a recognized region of the United States. Notable extremes range from East Texas which is often considered {{an extension of the}} Deep South, to Far West Texas which is generally acknowledged {{to be part of the}} interior Southwest.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{literature}} is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which {{are rooted in}} the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively. There are four major themes that can be found within historical Canadian literature; nature, frontier life, Canada's position within the world, all three of which tie into the garrison mentality. By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as some of the world's best. Canada's ethnic <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>diversity</b> are reflected in its literature, with many of its most prominent modern writers focusing on ethnic life. Arguably, the best-known living Canadian writer internationally (especially since the deaths of Robertson Davies and Mordecai Richler) is Margaret Atwood, a prolific novelist, poet, and literary critic. Numerous other Canadian authors have accumulated international literary awards; including Nobel Laureate Alice Munro, who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English; and Booker Prize recipient Michael Ondaatje, who is perhaps best known for the novel The English Patient, which was adapted as a film of the same name that won the Academy Award for Best Picture.|$|E
5|$|The Indian early medieval age, 600 CE to 1200 CE, {{is defined}} by {{regional}} kingdoms <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>diversity.</b> When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan. When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal. When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south. No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core region. During this time, pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared {{to make way for}} the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes. The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{highlight}} some perspectives in education in compulsory schools and in teacher education in the North especially connected to <b>cultural</b> understanding <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>diversities.</b> Sensitivity in <b>cultural</b> understanding including curriculum texts about minorities is very limited {{and so is the}} <b>cultural</b> sensitivity towards <b>and</b> co-operation between home <b>and</b> community culture. <b>Cultural</b> <b>diversities</b> are often seen only as dilemmas. These challenges have been taken seriously in the longitudinal research-project introduced in this report. The issues will be dealt with through the Sámi culture. The first research question focuses on how parents and the local society can be involved in development of a culturally based curriculum. The second research question is dealing with how teachers and parents can support <b>cultural</b> understanding, <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>diversities</b> in the school context. The third research question is dealing with parental involvement and cooperation between school, parents, elders, extended family and the indigenous community. An ethnographic study with an interactive approach will be the methodological point of departure. Interviews, school visits and document analysis are used. The whole project will be reported during 2007 - 2008...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Social Innovation has {{attracted}} the attention of both Scholars and Practitioners for the last years, but very little investigations are actually available about the drivers that lie upon the adoption of social innovative practices at “for-profit” firm’s level. This is particularly true with reference to culture <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>diversities.</b> According to the underlined gap, our paper aims to investigate the role of culture, <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>diversities,</b> in defining Corporate Social Innovation (CSI). Design/methodology/approach – The paper is theoretically grounded and based on an inductive approach. An extensive literary review about Innovation and Corporate Social Responsibility - as well as about their cultural drivers - has been carried to gain a wide understanding of CSI as a trade-off between firms’ innovative attitude and their propensity to reach social aims. Hofstede’s cultural model has been, finally, used to interpret the cultural insights of CSI in two different contexts, Italy and Iran. Empirical evidences have been collected thanks to the contribution of the University of Azad, Iran. They allow us to complete the theoretical considerations developed about Iranian firms’ social orientation. Originality/value – Our paper contribute to the literature improving about CSI by developing a more comprehensive knowledge and culturally-based understanding within a still unexplored field. Practical implications – Our paper will expand the ability of both Academics and Practitioners to recognize culture as key driver of CSI. In doing this, it opens up future exploitations about the way culture <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>diversities</b> may be managed in order to improve the effectiveness of firms’ innovative practices with reference to corporate and collective well-being...|$|R

30|$|As widely {{highlighted}} in management literature, culture affects both firms’ innovativeness and CSR (e.g., Kaasa and Vadi 2010). Since {{values and beliefs}} differently shape firms’ innovative behavior, culture may enable the emergence of CSI.

Taking into account these considerations, we aim to investigate the role of culture <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>diversities,</b> in defining CSI.|$|R

25|$|Following its independence, the Philippines {{has seen}} both small and {{large-scale}} immigration into the country, mostly involving American, European, Chinese and Japanese peoples. After World War II, South Asians continued to migrate into the islands, {{most of which}} assimilated and avoided the local social stigma instilled by the early Spaniards against them by keeping a low profile and/or by trying to pass as Spanish mestizos. This was also true for the Arab and Chinese immigrants, {{many of whom are}} also post WWII arrivals. More recent migrations into the country by Koreans, Persians, Brazilians, and other Southeast Asians have contributed to the enrichment of the country's ethnic landscape, language and culture. Centuries of migration, diaspora, assimilation, <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>diversity</b> made most Filipinos accepting of interracial marriage and multiculturalism.|$|E
25|$|The {{legacy of}} the hippie {{movement}} continues to permeate Western society. In general, unmarried couples of all ages feel free to travel and live together without societal disapproval. Frankness regarding sexual matters has become more common, {{and the rights of}} homosexual, bisexual and transsexual people, as well as people who choose not to categorize themselves at all, have expanded. Religious <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>diversity</b> has gained greater acceptance. Co-operative business enterprises and creative community living arrangements are more accepted than before. Some of the little hippie health food stores of the 1960s and 1970s are now large-scale, profitable businesses, due to greater interest in natural foods, herbal remedies, vitamins and other nutritional supplements. Authors Stewart Brand and John Markoff argue that the development and popularization of personal computers and the Internet find one of their primary roots in the anti-authoritarian ethos promoted by hippie culture.|$|E
