40|$|Annual {{recruitment}} of the NewZealand longfin eel (Anguilla dieffenbachii) hasdecreased by 75 per cent since significant levels of commercial fishing {{began in the}} early 1970 s. This motivates application of a multiple-cohort bioeconomic model to a New Zealand longfin eel fishery to investigate its optimal management and ascertain the suitability of existing regulatory policy. The use of historical harvest to calculate total allowable catch is asserted to be unsustainable based on recovery dynamics. In addition, individual transferable quota systems are argued to be fundamentally flawed for the protection of longfin fisheries because of high-grading, low-surplus production and a current lack of effective stock-assessment procedures. <b>Area</b> <b>closure</b> and the spatial definition of harvest rights are attractive alternatives given the territoriality of longfins and high larval spillover. The importance of unfished reserves is reinforcedwhen significant uncertainties regarding population strength, harvest intensity and growth dynamics are considered.

50|$|Growth rates {{within the}} wild stocks vary with some (i.e. the Hauraki Gulf, NZ) growing rapidly {{and to a}} smaller maximum length, while stocks in east and west Australia are known to grow more slowly. The species is capable of living about 40 years {{throughout}} much of its range in Australia, and the Australian recordholder of 40 years and 10 months was a 935-mm large-nosed male, caught on 1 September 2007 off Bunbury, West Australia, and photographed {{on the day of}} capture. Sexual maturity is reached at about 30 cm long and {{a small percentage of the}} males will turn into females at puberty. Large individuals of both sexes develop a prominent hump on the head. Anglers are advised not to take immature fish, so as not to reduce breeding stock. The legal size in Australia varies by state, from 35 cm and a bag limit of five fish per person in Queensland to 50 cm in Western Australia. During spawning, these fish obtain a metallic green sheen which indicates a high concentration of acid buildup within the scales' infrastructure.

40|$|Seasonal <b>area</b> <b>closures</b> of {{fisheries}} are primarily {{used to reduce}} fishing mortality on target species. In the absence of effort controls, fishing vessels displaced from a closed area will impact fish populations and the environment elsewhere. Based on the observed response of the North Sea beam trawl fleet to {{the closure of the}} "cod box" and an existing size-based model of the impacts of beam trawling, we predict the effects of seasonal <b>area</b> <b>closures</b> on benthic communities in the central North Sea. We suggest that repeated seasonal <b>area</b> <b>closures</b> would lead to a slightly more homogeneous distribution of annual trawling activity, although the distribution would remain patchy rather than random. The increased homogeneity, coupled with the displacement of trawling activity to previously unfished areas, is predicted to have slightly greater cumulative impacts on total benthic invertebrate production and lead to localized reductions in benthic biomass for several years. To ensure the effective integration {{of fisheries}} and environmental management, the wider consequences of fishery management actions should be considered a priori. Thus, when seasonal closures increase the homogeneity of overall disturbance or lead to the redistribution of trawling activity to environmentally sensitive or previously unfished areas, then effort reductions or permanent <b>area</b> <b>closures</b> should be considered as a management option. The latter would lead to a single but permanent redistribution of fishing disturbance, with lower cumulative impacts on benthic communities in the long run...|$|E
40|$|Year-round {{closed areas}} have been {{proposed}} as a management tool for fisheries and have been implemented {{in a number of}} fisheries around the world. It has been suggested that for some fisheries, permanently closing part of the fishery may sustain or increase harvests. However, there is little empirical evidence to support this claim and little is known about how <b>area</b> <b>closures</b> should be designed. This dissertation uses bioeconomic modeling to explore how <b>area</b> <b>closures</b> of varied design will affect fisheries and fishers. The focus of study is on the use of <b>area</b> <b>closures</b> for the groundfish fisheries in New England. However, the methodologies and general results are applicable to other fisheries as well. ^ A major focus of the research is the development of a fleet dynamics model. The motivation for studying fleet dynamics extends beyond its relevance to evaluating the impacts of <b>area</b> <b>closures.</b> Understanding fleet dynamics is critical to the management of many fisheries for which catch and effort for specific areas or species is not tightly controlled. ^ The dissertation is composed of three manuscripts. The subject of the first two manuscripts is a model of fleet dynamics for New England trawl fisheries. Manuscript one provides a discussion on how the model is developed, specified and tested and used to predict the aggregate distribution of fishing effort between fisheries and areas. Manuscript two explores in more depth the development of the behavioral model on which the fleet dynamics model is based and presents tests of the validity of a number of hypotheses found in the literature about the behavior of fishers as individuals and in groups. The third manuscript presents the culmination of the research, the spatial, bioeconomic model of New England groundfish fisheries. The results from different versions of the model are presented and evaluated, and conclusions about the usefulness of <b>area</b> <b>closures</b> under varied conditions are drawn. We find that the location of reserves and the level and distribution of fishing effort are critical factors in designing reserves that are beneficial to the fishery. ...|$|E

30|$|The {{results of}} this study brought some clues on {{previous}} soil and water conservation programs implemented in Guna-Tana watershed. Firstly, increasing in vegetation greenness has spatial variability that it is realized in places where <b>area</b> <b>closure</b> was implemented. Studies undertaken in some parts of Ethiopia claimed that <b>area</b> <b>closure</b> is found effective for positive vegetation reclamation and biomass fixation in the soil (Mekuria and Aynekulu 2011; Wolde and Mastewal 2013; Abera and Fitih 2015). In other words, collective physical soil and water conservation measures and community based reforestation programs were encountering problems of implementation in terms of technical specifications and community acceptance (Waga et al. 2007; Abera and Fitih 2015). This hinders vast expanses of Guna tana watershed for not experiencing profoundly significant vegetation regeneration and changes in NPP which is a prime indication of ecosystem health. A study by Simane and Zaitchik (2014) supported the findings of this study. Accordingly, CNRM in northern Ethiopian highlands is reported unsustainable and even natural resources management institutions were at risk of unsustainability. Lack of institutional capacity and livelihood problems were challenging implementation process. In some watersheds where non-governmental organizations respond to support soil and water conservation programs and livelihood support system, there was intended watershed rehabilitation and positive biomass change (Essayas et al. 2014; Gebregziabher et al. 2016). This indicates that beyond inception of soil and water conservation programs in the watershed for rehabilitation and vegetation restoration, institutional capacitation and community based awareness and mainstreaming of conservation activities with rural livelihoods.|$|R
