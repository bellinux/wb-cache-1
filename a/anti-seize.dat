40|$|Eight commercially {{available}} thread lubricants were evaluated {{to determine the}} best replacement for Red Lead and Graphite in Mineral Oil (RLGMO). The evaluation included coefficient of friction testing, high temperature <b>anti-seizing</b> testing, room temperature anti-galling testing, chemical analysis for detrimental impurities, corrosion testing, off-gas testing, and a review of health and environmental factors. The coefficient of friction testing covered a wide variety of factors including stud, nut, and washer materials, sizes, manufacturing methods, surface coatings, surface finishes, applied loads, run-in cycles, and relubrication. Only one lubricant, Dow Corning Molykote P 37, met all the criteria established for a replacement lubricant. It has a coefficient of friction range similar to RLGMO. Therefore, it can be substituted directly for RLGMO without changing the currently specified fastener torque values for the sizes, materials and conditions evaluated. Other lubricants did not perform as well as Molykote P 37 in one or more test or evaluation categories...|$|R

5000|$|Whether {{a rubber}} bushing can be {{replaced}} or repaired depends upon the propeller; some cannot. Some can, but need special equipment to insert the oversized bushing for an interference fit. Others {{can be replaced}} easily. The [...] "special equipment" [...] usually consists of a funnel, a press and rubber lubricant (soap). If {{one does not have}} access to a lathe, an improvised funnel can be made from steel tube and car body filler; as the filler is only subject to compressive forces it is able to do a good job. Often, the bushing can be drawn into place with nothing more complex than a couple of nuts, washers and a threaded rod. A more serious problem with this type of propeller is a [...] "frozen-on" [...] spline bushing, which makes propeller removal impossible. In such cases the propeller must be heated in order to deliberately destroy the rubber insert. Once the propeller is removed, the splined tube can be cut away with a grinder and a new spline bushing is then required. To prevent a recurrence of the problem, the splines can be coated with <b>anti-seize</b> anti-corrosion compound.|$|E
40|$|<b>Anti-seize</b> {{lubricant}} {{commonly used}} on threaded fasteners {{makes it difficult}} to prepare surfaces adequately for magnetic particle and liquid penetrant testing. In high temperature applications, the lubricant forms a tenacious residue on the threaded fastener. An alternative surface examination technique requiring minimal surface preparation would reduce inspection cost and duration. Two types of threaded fasteners, reactor pressure vessel closure studs and turbine casing studs, have been targeted for investigation. Eddy current techniques requiring minimal surface preparation and capable of detecting flaws are being developed for these two applications. Other advantages of eddy current inspection over magnetic particle testing and liquid penetrant testing include the absence of consumable materials, capability to provide permanent digital records, and the potential for automation...|$|E
40|$|Martin Marietta was {{contracted}} by {{the government}} to complete a study to replace ozone depleting chemicals (ODCs) in use at Air Force Plant PJKS. This facility is an Air Force owned, contractor operated facility located at Martin Marietta Technologies, Inc. (MMTI) in Denver Colorado. Applications involving ODCs at this facility have included 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane (TCA) and 1, 1, 2 -trichloro- 1, 2, 2 -trifluoroethane, also known as Freon- 1 13 @ or Chlorofluorocarbon 113 (CFC- 113). These two chemicals have been used extensively at PJKS for over twenty years. The three primary areas of use investigated in this study are in mechanical degreasing operations, in an <b>anti-seize</b> material used to lubricate high-torque fittings, and in electrical cleaning operations. As part of this study, the chemistry and physics of cleaning operations were evaluated. Performance characteristics of good cleaners include the ability to dislodge the contaminant, which is favored by a low surface tension cleaner. The dissolution of the contaminant was also discussed along with several empirical and theoretical descriptions of solubility. Dispersion of the contaminant in the cleaner is also important because this process prevents recontamination of the cleaned surface after removal from the cleaner. Finally, a family of solvents was generated using a three-component solubility parameter, and this description was useful in identifying solvents required for dissolving a particular chemical residue...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. To {{investigate}} the increased performance possibilities of screws on submersible pumps by vibratory finishing of their surfaces. Method. The vibratory finishing method {{is based on}} two principles: rejection of light plastic deformation polishing {{as well as the}} complication of kinematics associated with known cold working processes. Results. A schematic diagram of vibratory finishing; the compiled graphs show pressure, occurring in the surface layer of steel 30 KhGSA when lathe turning and vibratory finishing; the microhardness dependence on the work hardening distribution depth at rolling and vibratory finishing is determined. It is established that since vibratory finishing is a method of hardening, kinematic and dynamic characteristics of the process are connected, as in other types of finishing, with characteristic indicators of machined surfaces. The task of developing methods for determining the vibratory finishing regime is complicated, firstly by the number of parameters that determine the process conditions being considerably greater than tumbling and other processing methods with relatively simple kinematics; secondly, {{due to the fact that}} all the mode parameters affect all surface quality characteristics in one way or another. Conclusion. When vibratory finishing the surface layer of a screw submerged in a vibratory machine, using steel shots for burnishing, an extension of the surface layer's elastic-plastic deformation to a certain depth is achieved. The temperature at the time of vibratory finishing, according to conventional standards, does not exceed 150 - 300 OC; moreover, it decreases sharply with increasing depth and at room temperature is already at the depth of 0. 1 - 0. 3 mm from the surface of the screw. Microrelief optimisation of the bearing surfaces is the most effective way to improve conformability, reduce the run-in and normal wear and improve <b>anti-seize</b> properties. The efficiency and potential for the use of vibratory finishing in virtually all areas of the metal industry is proven. </p...|$|E
40|$|While {{using an}} {{electrochemical}} method {{to cover the}} large-sized work-pieces, units, and products up to 6 м 3 by protective coating, {{there is a certain}} difficulty to apply traditional anodizing techniques in a plating vat, and it is necessary to find various processing techniques. To use the existing micro-arc oxide coating (MOC) methods for work-pieces of various forms and sizes in a plating vat is complicated in case it is required to provide oxide layers in separate places rather than over entire surface of a work-piece. The challenge is to treat flat surfaces in various directions, external and internal surfaces of rotation bodies, profiled surfaces, intersections, closed and through holes, pipes, as well as spline and thread openings for ensuring <b>anti-seize</b> properties in individual or small-scale production to meet technical requirements and operational properties of products. A design of tools to provide MOC-process of all possible surfaces of various engineering box-type products depends on many factors and can be considerably different even when processing the surfaces of the same forms. An attachment to be used is fixed directly on a large-sized design (a work-piece, a product) or fastened in the special tool. The features of technological process, design shape, and arrangement of the processed surfaces define a fastening method of the attachment. Therefore it is necessary to pay much attention to a choice of the processing pattern and a design of tools. The Kaluga-branch of Bauman Moscow State Technical University is an original proposer of methods to form MOC-coatings on the separate surfaces of large-sized work-pieces using the moved and stationary electrodes to solve the above listed tasks. The following results of work {{will have an impact on}} development of the offered processing methods and their early implementation in real production: 1. To provide oxide coatings on the surfaces of large-sized products or assemblies in a single or small-scale type of production by the other methods is impossible. 2. There is a developed method to calculate volume electrolyte velocity while processing the large-sized work-pieces by means of moved electrode, taking into consideration the modes of MOC-coating formation and a design of the moved electrode. When processing a surface of  1 dm 2 depending on the modes of MOC-coating formation and a design of the moved electrode the volume electrolyte velocity will make 4 − 6 l/min. 3. A descriptive design-engineering classification of methods for micro-arc oxide coating of separate surfaces of large-sized work-pieces is created on the basis of coated surface geometry, used electrode design, and formation method of a plating vat. 4. The classified methods can be successfully used in creating technologies of large-sized products from titanic alloys, and the offered table is useful both for experts, and for students when studying electrochemical methods of processing. </p...|$|E
