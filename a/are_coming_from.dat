50|$|An {{example of}} visual capture {{experienced}} {{in daily life}} {{is known as the}} “ventriloquism effect”. This is when ventriloquists make their speech appear to <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> their puppet rather than their own mouths. In this situation, visual capture allows the audio stimuli to be controlled by the vision system and produce a congruent experience that the sound <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the puppet.Another popular example of visual capture happens while watching a movie in a theater, and the sound appears to <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the actors lips. Although this may seem true, the sound <b>is</b> actually <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the speakers, often spread out across the theater rather than directly behind wherever the character’s mouth may be.|$|R

25|$|The autumn in Scania {{is a slow}} process, {{compared}} with more northern parts of Sweden (but a faster one, when comparing with {{any part of the}} British Isles). During the first half of September, temperatures usually are not so much affected, but the sunset is obviously earlier {{compared with}} in June. Temperatures drop in steps. Every new period with sunny weather becomes a bit cooler than the last one. By the end of October the defoliation process becomes evident. But not until late November all trees have lost their leaves. The period when storms and even hurricanes becomes most likely to occur durates between November and February. Most of them <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the Atlantic Ocean and doesn't involve snow or temperatures below freezing point. Late Scanian autumn is in general benefited from the surrounding waters (the opposite effect early spring).|$|E

25|$|Plastic {{changes to}} the body schema are active and continuous. For example, gradual {{changes to the}} body schema must occur over the {{lifetime}} of an individual {{as he or she}} grows and absolute and relative sizes of body parts change over his or her life span. The development of the body schema has also been shown to occur in young children. One study showed that with these children (9-, 14-, and 19-month-olds), older children handled spoons so as to optimally and comfortably grip them for use, whereas younger children tended to reach with their dominant hand, regardless of the orientation of the spoon and eventual ease of use. Short-term plasticity has been shown with the integration of tools into the body schema. The rubber hand illusion has also shown the rapid reorganization of the body schema on the timescale of seconds, showing the high level of plasticity and speed with which the body schema reorganizes. In the Illusion, participants view a dummy hand being stroked with a paintbrush, while their own hand is stroked identically. Participants may feel that the touches on their hand <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the dummy hand, and even that the dummy hand is, in some way, their own hand.|$|E

This may be part of a project to build a high-speed, which could cannibalize ridership from the airport.

There's no tricks. It's honesty with big melodies. And [...] singing the s*** out of them." [...] During an interview, Mars explained that after writing and producing songs for other artists, he thought that he could write a song for himself. He started writing the lyrics of [...] "Talking To The Moon" [...] while playing the piano.

500|$|It's Better If You Don't Understand is {{composed}} of four songs employing pop, pop rock, and hip hop genres. Mars explained that the EP is hard to classify since: [...] "I just write songs that I strongly believe in and that <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> inside. There's no tricks. It's honesty with big melodies. And I'm singing the s*** out of them". Labeled as a [...] "romantic croon", the opening track, [...] "Somewhere in Brooklyn", was composed by The Smeezingtons. It features [...] "an emo-pop backing" [...] beat, a piano and synthesizers. Lyrically, the tune is about Mars chasing the [...] "perfect woman" [...] who got away, and wishing to find her again. The second release, [...] "The Other Side", features a vocal collaboration with Cee Lo Green and B.o.B., and is considered the best on the EP by some critics. The track {{has been described as}} incorporating 60's and 70's soulful feeling. Its instrumentation uses guitar, organ and a: [...] "drum and bass pace that slowly builds through the verse and into the chorus". It is reminiscent of compositions by Daniel Merriweather and Chris Isaak’s [...] "Wicked Game". [...] "The Other Side" [...] shows Mars' darker side has a [...] "soaring pop" [...] hook.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{gave the}} soundtrack {{three out of}} five stars, commenting that [...] "some {{of this stuff is}} quite good".

Jim Farber from New York Daily News criticized Aguilera for her [...] "vocals offer the same distracting loop-de-loops and showy tics", but complimented Cher that she [...] "balances both aspects ideally".

Leah Greanblatt from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "B" [...] score, naming it a [...] "shamelessly diva-fied mix of balladry, Broadway cabaret, and backroom boogie-woogie" [...] and complimented on its musical departure from Aguilera's previous studio album Bionic. In a positive review, Billboard editor Kerri Mason praised Burlesque as [...] "a campy celebration of diva-dom and an over-the-top, triple-threat performance". James Wigney of The Advertiser praised Aguilera's [...] "vocal gymnastics", but was mixed towards Cher's numbers on the soundtrack. Maura Johnston from The Village Voice named [...] "The Beautiful People (from Burlesque)" [...] as the thirteenth worst song of 2010, calling it [...] "an interesting failure." ...|$|E

Woodburne believes that Karl and Susan have a strong connection that is [...] "based upon such a good grounding". Karl and Susan are best friends who enjoy each other's company, share a deep connection and take joy in each other's quirks and ways. Woodburne described them as having a [...] "really solid foundation for a marriage" [...] and she has said that she does not want to see Susan and Karl's relationship break up again.

Fletcher said [...] "Karl and Susan every now and again do go through a phase where they become slightly more amorous than in their tougher times and tougher storylines – suffice to say it's not bawdy, but I think the audience will enjoy the fun aspect". Karl and Susan have been caught in the nude together on three occasions; at the beach, in Lou Carpenter's (Tom Oliver) spa and when they went skinny-dipping in the bush. When asked what makes Karl and Susan popular with viewers, Woodburne said [...] "Because I think they're so flawed. There's two things: they make horrendous mistakes, both of them, but they both <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> a place of well meaning. They're both wanting to try and {{do the right thing and}} be helpful, but so often they get it so terribly wrong, and I think we can all relate to that." ...|$|E
