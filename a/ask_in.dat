5|$|The {{impending}} {{dinner with}} Mr. Burns divides the Simpson household. Homer pragmatically supports Mr. Burns, while Marge and Lisa oppose him. Before the dinner arrives, Mr. Burns's advisers prepare {{the family for}} the event, even giving them pre-written questions to <b>ask</b> <b>in</b> lieu of conversation. Lisa becomes disillusioned by it all, but Marge tells her not to worry. To everyone's surprise, Marge serves Blinky for dinner. Mr. Burns tries {{to act as if}} it does not bother him, but is not able to keep from spitting it out. The cameras flash as the bite flies through the air, {{and by the time the}} chunk hits the floor the press is gone and his governatorial campaign dissolves. Bailey wins the election and, despite Mr. Burns saying that Homer's dreams will be unfulfilled for as long as he is alive, the Simpson family happily get together again.|$|E
25|$|This decree of an Italian rabbi {{pronounced}} {{against a}} Turkish colleague was an unprecedented {{attack on the}} rights of the community, and provoked the righteous indignation of the Jewish social order in Constantinopleall the more as it proved to rest upon a groundless and vulgar calumny. Capsali, conscious of having been maligned, did not mince matters in answering Colon's letters; and a bitter discussion arose between the two men, in which the leading rabbis of Germany, Italy, and the Orient took part. It is characteristic of Colon that as soon as he became convinced that he had been the victim of an intrigue, and so had done injustice to the ḥakham bashi, he did not hesitate to make amends. On his deathbed, he commissioned his son Perez to go to Constantinople and <b>ask,</b> <b>in</b> his father's name, the forgiveness of Capsali.|$|E
25|$|If people <b>ask</b> <b>in</b> {{the name}} of {{religion}} we must help them. The vehicle of this support is a complete boycott of the enemies' goods. Each riyal, dirham …etc. used to buy their goods eventually becomes bullets to be fired at the hearts of brothers and children in Palestine. For this reason, it is an obligation not to help them (the enemies of Islam) by buying their goods. To buy their goods is to support tyranny, oppression and aggression. Buying goods from them will strengthen them; our duty is to make them as weak as we can. Our obligation is to strengthen our resisting brothers in the Sacred Land {{as much as we}} can. If we cannot strengthen the brothers, we have a duty to make the enemy weak. If their weakness cannot be achieved except by boycott, we must boycott them.|$|E

25|$|The {{consequences}} of Androgeos' death {{are described in}} the Bibliotheca as follows. Minos received the news of his son's death when he was performing a sacrificial rite {{in honor of the}} Charites at Paros. Overcome by grief, he threw off his garland and ordered for the music to stop, but did complete the sacrifice, from which circumstance the festivals in honor of the Charites at Paros involved no music or flowers from then on. Minos led a war against Athens to avenge the death of his son, but failed to sack the city and prayed to Zeus that the Athenians may be punished. The city was struck with famine and pestilence. The Athenians consulted an oracle as to how to avert the calamity, and were instructed to sacrifice the daughters of Hyacinthus the Lacedaemonian, but this didn't help. The citizens consulted the oracle once again and were told to give Minos whatever he might <b>ask</b> <b>in</b> retribution. The king obliged the Athenians to send several youths every seven or nine years to be devoured by the Minotaur. This continued until the Minotaur was killed by Theseus.|$|E
500|$|... "Lord Tell Me Why" [...] is {{a gospel}} song with a rolling funk groove, sung from the {{perspective}} of a lower class White man who has become disillusioned with the American dream. His ironic lyrics <b>ask</b> <b>in</b> the chorus, [...] "Lord tell me why a white man / Ain't worth nothin' in this world no more." [...] The guitar-based [...] "I Want My Crown" [...] was recorded with an 11-piece band and has an aggressive blues style, rumba-rock groove, and growling vocals. The song is an indictment of politicians as [...] "Judas men" [...] who sided with oil barons and Republicans, and their greed that leads to war. [...] "I Want My Crown" [...] has been described by one writer as a [...] "Mephistopheles-as-Right-winger character study".|$|E
500|$|Writing to Caliph al-Radi (r. 934–940) in 936, Muhammad ibn Tughj {{could present}} a commendable record: the Fatimid {{invasion}} was defeated and first measures {{for improving the}} financial situation in the province had been undertaken. The caliph confirmed him in his post and sent robes of honour. As Hugh N. Kennedy writes, [...] "in some ways the Fatimid threat actually helped Ibn Tughj" [...] since, {{as long as he}} supported the Abbasids, [...] "the caliphs were prepared to give their approval to his rule in return". His standing in the Abbasid court was sufficient for him to <b>ask</b> <b>in</b> 938 for the honorific title (laqab) of al-Ikhshid, originally held by the kings of his ancestral homeland Farghana. Caliph al-Radi granted the request, although formal approval was delayed until July 939. After receiving official confirmation, Ibn Tughj required that he be henceforth addressed solely by his new title.|$|E

500|$|Even the {{characters}} have Virgilian counterparts, with Booth being comparable to Aeneas and Miss Mathews Fielding's version of Dido. Fielding does not {{shy away from}} such comparisons, but embraces them with {{his use of the}} line [...] "Furens quid Foemina possit" [...] (translated as [...] "what a woman can do in frenzy"), in Book IV, Chapter Five; this line is directly taken from the Aeneid. Likewise, Fielding's bailiff misstates Virgil's [...] "dolus an virtus, quis in hoste requirat" [...] (translated as [...] "whether deceit or valour, who would <b>ask</b> <b>in</b> the enemy") when he says [...] "Bolus and Virtus, quis in a Hostess equirit" [...] in Book VIII, Chapter One. However, these are not the only quotes, and Fielding cites many passages of Latin and Greek while not providing direct translations for them. To these Virgilian parallels, Samuel Richardson claimed that Fielding [...] "must mean Cotton's Virgil Travestied; where the women are drabs, and the men scoundrels." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Master Teacher" [...] was {{conceived}} by Georgia Anne Muldrow on her Rhodes piano at Sa-Ra's Cosmic Dust Studio with Badu present and was originally intended {{for one of}} their albums. Its idyllic music blends mellow soul and glitchy hip hop, featuring a chopped sample of Curtis Mayfield's 1972 song [...] "Freddie's Dead". The song's lyrics envision {{a higher degree of}} African-American identity. Its vocalists <b>ask</b> <b>in</b> refrain, [...] "What if there was no niggas, only master teachers?", and answering [...] "I stay woke", with Badu responding [...] "I'm in the search of something new / Search inside me, searching inside you". Midway through the song, Poyser's keyboards lower the music's tempo, with a fluid, jazzy sound. [...] "That Hump" [...] concerns the topic of drug dependency. The closing track [...] "Telephone" [...] is a tribute to J Dilla, who died in 2006 from complications with blood disorder, and has themes of sorrow and hope. It serves as a departure from the preceding songs' edgier musical direction, featuring soft melodies and an acoustic feel similar to Badu's live sound. The song opens with the sound of ominous sirens, referencing J Dilla's 2006 album Donuts. The song's lyrics are based on a story told to Badu by J Dilla's mother on the day of his death. Poyser explained in an interview, [...] "Dilla's mom told Erykah about one day when he was telling her about this dream he had where Ol'Dirty was telling him to get on a different color bus and giving him directions home". According to Poyser, the song's music was inspired by Dilla's passing: ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{his health}} {{deteriorated}} in these circumstances, Sigüenza {{prepared for the}} eventuality of his death, which came in 1700. A scientist to the end, he requested that his body be autopsied, so that physicians could determine what had afflicted him. He explicitly laid out the reasons and concerned that this radical step might be opposed on religious or other grounds by his relatives, he said [...] "I <b>ask</b> <b>in</b> God's name that this [...] be done for the common good, and I command my heir not to interfere, for it matters little that this be done to a body which, within a few days, must be corruption and decay."

2500|$|In unity with Christianity, the Community of Christ upholds the Bible as scripture.

2500|$|According to Walter Kaufmann, {{the basic}} idea of Hegel's works, {{especially}} the Phenomenology of Spirit, is that a philosopher should not [...] "confine him or herself to views that have been held but penetrate these to the human reality they reflect."

Every outlook in other words, is to be studied not merely as an academic possibility but as an existential reality." [...] Walter Kaufmann has argued that as unlikely as it may sound, it is not the case that Hegel was unable to write clearly, but that Hegel felt that [...] "he must and should not write in the way in which he was gifted." ...|$|E

[...] He was also stung both by the {{criticism}} by Robert Hunt, writing in The Examiner on July 31, 1808, to object to Blake's depiction of the soul as if it were nothing but the mortal body; and by the similar criticism in the November 1808 edition of the Anti-Jacobin Review which described his illustrations as [...] "the offspring of morbid fancy" [...] and an attempt [...] "to connect the visible with the invisible world" [...] that had [...] "totally failed".

The only person who gave me some moral support, after I'd bowled the six overs, was Keith Stackpole, he was vice-captain. He ran up and said, 'It's not easy first-up, 'Wok'.

2500|$|In 1998, Answers in Genesis filmed an {{interview}} with Richard Dawkins, a prominent evolutionary biologist at Oxford University, resulting in a controversial video that AiG posted on its website. Dawkins addressed it in the essay: [...] "The 'Information Challenge'", published in A Devil's Chaplain in 2003. The [...] "suspiciously amateurish" [...] interview included, according to Dawkins, [...] "the kind of question only a creationist would <b>ask</b> <b>in</b> that way" [...] (namely, to [...] "give {{an example of a}} genetic mutation or an evolutionary process which can be seen to increase the information in the genome"). Realising that he had been duped, Dawkins, at his own admission, was angry at the thought and initially refused to answer the question, but relented and continued the interview. Dawkins wrote: [...] "My generosity was rewarded in a fashion that anyone familiar with fundamentalist tactics might have predicted. When I eventually saw the film a year later, I found that it had been edited to give the false impression that I was incapable of answering the question about information content. In fairness, this may not have been quite as intentionally deceitful as it sounds. You have to understand that these people really believe that their question cannot be answered!" ...|$|E
