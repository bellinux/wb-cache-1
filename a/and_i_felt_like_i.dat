500|$|In June 2011, it was {{announced}} that Russell Tovey would appear in Sherlock series two in its second episode. Tovey, who liked Sherlock for staying true to the style of the novels despite its modern twist, said of the experience: [...] "It's amazing {{to be a part of}} it", adding, [...] "I got to act with Benedict and Martin which was awesome". The actor also explained that during his scenes, [...] "We did about two and a half weeks of night shoots in Cardiff <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> had jetlag." [...] In terms of Henry's character, Tovey did not want him to be a [...] "jibbering wreck", but rather mature and truthful as well as damaged and haunted. Gatiss also made Henry display signs of survivor guilt. Tovey's nephew auditioned for the part of a younger Henry, but another child actor was cast for the role as the nephew was considered too young.|$|E
500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007. Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. [...] "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," [...] she said. [...] "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun {{to be able to}} say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying to have fun with it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction to pull it off, stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so you need someone there to tell you you can't do that." ...|$|E
500|$|Following his transfer, Garland {{opened his}} stint with La Salle on December 15, 2012 in a road game against Bucknell, scoring 9 points in 22 minutes {{off the bench}} and {{recording}} 2 turnovers and 4 personal fouls. He did not {{take part in the}} team's earlier games because he was ineligible due to NCAA regulations regarding player transfers. In the game that followed, he posted a career-best 26 points as a bench player in a win over Iona. He also added 3 rebounds, an assist, and a steal in the 23 minutes he was on the court. In a seven-minute stretch in the second half, Garland scored 14 straight points. He said after the game, [...] "I used to do it in high school. It kind of felt like high school when I was out there; it just felt good". Garland, who led the Explorers in scoring, also received praise from head coach John Giannini. On December 22, 2012, he had another impactful performance vs Sacred Heart, with six assists in 31 minutes of play. This was also his first-ever start under Giannini. The coach commented about Garland, [...] "He's a very underrated passer. People think because he scored all those points in high school he's a scorer first and foremost. I think he's a very good passer". However, this would be his sole start in his junior year at La Salle. Garland was effective in the opening, First Four round of the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament against Boise State, finishing with a team-high 22 points and, in turn, scoring 20 or more points for the second time as a junior. After the game, Giannini told Garland, [...] "This is why I chased you all over the place, to win NCAA tournament games and see if you could be a great player". On March 23, 2014, against the Ole Miss Rebels, Garland made a scooping layup off the backboard with 2.5 seconds left in regulation to send La Salle into the Sweet 16 round of the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. The game-winner was known as the [...] "Southwest Philly Floater," [...] following Garland's post-game comments, in which he said, [...] "That's the Southwest Philly Floater, man. Shoutout to my Cousin Bern, shoutout to my Mom". He made the shot in spite of defensive efforts from the Rebels' 6ft 9 in (2.06 m) center Reginald Buckner, who had blocked the Explorer multiple times in the game. Garland recalled the play, saying, [...] "Time was running out, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> could get the drive. When I cut, I just saw an opening and took the ball up...I went in there and knew if I could get an open shot, I could make it". Following a defeat to Wichita State that ended the team's tournament run and their season, Garland was averaging 13.1 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 2 assists.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with KQED's Michael Montgomery, Haag cited concerns from constituents about the negative impact the marijuana industry was having in their communities.

5000|$|Sendlein went undrafted in the 2007 NFL Draft, but {{signed with}} the Arizona Cardinals as an undrafted free agent.

5000|$|Chiho {{was unhappy}} while {{studying}} economics at Hosei University.

5000|$|The {{novel is}} set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago.

5000|$|Williams was {{sympathetic}} to the tempestuous on-court behaviour of male tennis players in the 1980s including Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, and Ilie Năstase, later saying {{in an interview that}} [...] "Sometimes I'd be doing the commentary and criticising the players for their behaviour <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a complete sham." [...] Williams would also be admonished by McEnroe himself, who told the umpire at the 1978 Davis Cup Final between the USA and Great Britain to [...] "tell that Brit commentator to keep his voice down." ...|$|R
500|$|As most of {{the main}} cast was not from the Orthodox community, Burshtein {{instructed}} them to attend {{all of the major}} events that take place within the film, including a wedding and a circumcision.

I was just so disgusted. I thought 'This is even worse than the film business. I wanted to grow as an artist <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was being {{squashed}} into a box. It wasn't really what I wanted to do, so I said 'Screw it', started really working on my acting career and kind of left it alone." ...|$|E
5000|$|Once the {{qualifying}} {{session was}} completed, Martin stated, [...] "I'll {{never do that}} again. I anticipated the car being loose, but I didn't ask Rodney if he tightened it up.

I knew that I only had to make it one mile without wrecking, and I was going to drive to the limit and slightly beyond, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> did that. I wouldn't want to do that again. But I couldn't sit on these poles without the fastest race car, and MWR and Rodney Childers in particular and the guys on our team are doing that." ...|$|E

5000|$|City Stars {{had planned}} to release a {{signature}} skateboard deck design, featuring Rodriguez's name on the grill of a Mercedes Benz (Rodriguez's first car), but Rodriguez departure from the company resulted in the product's cancellation. Rodriguez explained in February 2013: [...] "I specifically remember that I knew I wanted to quit <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> could at least show enough respect and tell them before they spent all that money to print up my boards.

The tribunal resulted in favour of Notts County, who was awarded £25,000 and increase further every appearance. Weston later reflected on his departure from Notts County to Brentford, quoting: ‘’"I don’t think they liked it when I left but the main reason was because Brentford were in League 1 <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> wanted {{to step up to}} the challenge of playing there.
