5|$|Oral {{polio vaccine}} (OPV) is an <b>attenuated</b> <b>vaccine,</b> {{produced}} by {{the passage of the}} virus through non-human cells at a sub-physiological temperature, which produces spontaneous mutations in the viral genome. Oral polio vaccines were developed by several groups, one of which was led by Albert Sabin. Other groups, led by Hilary Koprowski and H.R. Cox, developed their own <b>attenuated</b> <b>vaccine</b> strains. In 1958, the National Institutes of Health created a special committee on live polio vaccines. The various vaccines were carefully evaluated for their ability to induce immunity to polio, while retaining a low incidence of neuropathogenicity in monkeys. Large-scale clinical trials performed in the Soviet Union in late 1950s to early 1960s by Mikhail Chumakov and his colleagues demonstrated safety and high efficacy of the vaccine. Based on these results, the Sabin strains were chosen for worldwide distribution.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{experienced}} {{an outbreak of}} 58,000 and 35,000 polio cases, respectively, up from a typical number of some 20,000 a year. Amid this U.S. polio epidemic, millions of dollars were invested in finding and marketing a polio vaccine by commercial interests, including Lederle Laboratories in New York {{under the direction of}} H. R. Cox. Also working at Lederle was Polish-born virologist and immunologist Hilary Koprowski of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, who tested the first successful polio vaccine, in 1950. His vaccine, however, being a live attenuated virus taken orally, was still in the research stage and would not be ready for use until five years after Jonas Salk's polio vaccine (a dead-virus injectable vaccine) had reached the market. Koprowski's <b>attenuated</b> <b>vaccine</b> was prepared by successive passages through the brains of Swiss albino mice. By the seventh passage, the vaccine strains could no longer infect nervous tissue or cause paralysis. After one to three further passages on rats, the vaccine was deemed safe for human use. On 27 February 1950, Koprowski's live, <b>attenuated</b> <b>vaccine</b> was tested {{for the first time on}} an 8-year-old boy living at Letchworth Village, an institution for the physically and mentally disabled located in New York. After the child suffered no side effects, Koprowski enlarged his experiment to include 19 other children.|$|E

5000|$|The {{importance}} of immunization {{is so great}} that the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has named it one of the [...] "Ten Great Public Health Achievements in the 20th Century".Live <b>attenuated</b> <b>vaccines</b> have decreased pathogenicity. Their effectiveness depends on the immune systems ability to replicate and elicits a response similar to natural infection. It is usually effective with a single dose. Examples of live, <b>attenuated</b> <b>vaccines</b> include measles, mumps, rubella, MMR, yellow fever, varicella, rotavirus, and influenza (LAIV).|$|R
25|$|Pasteur {{publicly}} {{claimed his}} success in developing the anthrax vaccine in 1881. However, his admirer-turned-rival Toussaint {{was the one who}} developed the first vaccine. Toussaint isolated the bacteria that caused chicken cholera (later named Pasteurella in honour of Pasteur) in 1879 and gave samples to Pasteur who used them for his own works. On July 12, 1880, Toussaint presented his successful result to the French Academy of Sciences, using an <b>attenuated</b> <b>vaccine</b> against anthrax in dogs and sheep. Pasteur on grounds of jealousy contested the discovery by publicly displaying his vaccination method at Pouilly-le-Fort on 5 May 1881. Pasteur gave a misleading account of the preparation of the anthrax vaccine used in the experiment at Pouilly-le-Fort. He used potassium dichromate to prepare the vaccine. The promotional experiment was a success and helped Pasteur sell his products, getting the benefits and glory.|$|E

2500|$|Some anti-vaccine activists {{protest against}} the {{administration}} of a vaccine against mumps, claiming that the <b>attenuated</b> <b>vaccine</b> strain is harmful, and/or that the wild disease is beneficial. There is no evidence whatsoever to support {{the claim that the}} wild disease is beneficial, or that the MMR vaccine is harmful. Claims have been made that the MMR vaccine is linked to autism and inflammatory bowel disease, including one study by Andrew Wakefield. The paper was discredited and retracted in 2010 and Wakefield was later stripped of his license after his work was found to be an [...] "elaborate fraud". Also, subsequent studies indicate no link between vaccination with the MMR and autism. Since the dangers of the disease are well known, and the dangers of the vaccine are quite minimal, most doctors recommend vaccination.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of anti-virals has blunted the AIDS epidemic in the Western world but globally the epidemic {{has not been}} curtailed. Standard vaccines have not worked, and <b>attenuated</b> <b>vaccines</b> are not being developed because of safety concerns. Interest in <b>attenuated</b> <b>vaccines</b> has centered on isolated cases of patients infected with HIV- 1 containing a deleted nef gene. Nef is a multifunctional accessory protein that is necessary for full HIV- 1 virulence. Unfortunately, some patients infected with the nef-deleted virus eventually lose their CD 4 + T cells to levels indicating progression to AIDS...|$|R
5000|$|Because inactivated viruses tend {{to produce}} a weaker {{response}} by the immune system than live viruses, immunologic adjuvants and multiple [...] "booster" [...] injections {{may be required to}} provide an effective immune response against the inactivated pathogen. <b>Attenuated</b> <b>vaccines</b> are often preferable for generally healthy people because a single dose is often safe and very effective. However, some people cannot take <b>attenuated</b> <b>vaccines</b> because the pathogen poses too much risk for them (for example, elderly people or people with immunodeficiency). For those patients, an inactivated vaccine can provide protection.|$|R
50|$|Vaccination for duck viral {{enteritis}} is now {{routine in}} the United States. Only <b>attenuated</b> <b>vaccines</b> are efficacious.

2500|$|Some {{vaccines}} contain live, attenuated microorganisms. Many {{of these}} are active viruses that have been cultivated under conditions that disable their virulent properties, or that use closely related but less dangerous organisms to produce a broad immune response. Although most attenuated vaccines are viral, some are bacterial in nature. Examples include the viral diseases yellow fever, measles, mumps, and rubella, and the bacterial disease typhoid. The live Mycobacterium tuberculosis [...] vaccine developed by Calmette and Guérin is not made of a contagious strain but contains a virulently modified strain called [...] "BCG" [...] used to elicit an immune response to the vaccine. The live <b>attenuated</b> <b>vaccine</b> containing strain Yersinia pestis EV is used for plague immunization. Attenuated vaccines have some advantages and disadvantages. They typically provoke more durable immunological responses and are the preferred type for healthy adults. But {{they may not be}} safe for use in immunocompromised individuals, and may rarely mutate to a virulent form and cause disease.|$|E

30|$|Live or <b>attenuated</b> <b>vaccines</b> are {{efficient}} {{to control}} infectious diseases. However the safety concerns put live or <b>attenuated</b> <b>vaccines</b> to a debatable dilemma, which hinders {{the process of}} clinical applications. It is possible that vaccinated organisms may revert to wild-type or even hypervirulent organisms with its replication in the host. Therefore purified protective antigens were {{paid more attention to}} new generation mucosal vaccines. Direct mucosal administrations of soluble antigens only elicit relative low immunogenicity, thus safe and efficacious mucosal adjuvants are often co-administered with antigens to increase immunogenicity of non-living vaccines (De Magistnis, 2006). Furthermore, the adjuvant has been defined as immunopotentiator distinct from the delivery system previously (O’Hagan and Rappuoli, 2004).|$|R
50|$|Vaccines {{created through}} reverse {{genetics}} methods {{are known as}} <b>attenuated</b> <b>vaccines,</b> named because they contain weakened (attenuated) live viruses. <b>Attenuated</b> <b>vaccines</b> are created by combining genes from a novel or current virus strain with previously attenuated viruses of the same species. Attenuated viruses are created by propagating a live virus under novel conditions, such as a chicken’s egg. This produces a viral strain that is still live, but not pathogenic to humans, as these viruses are rendered defective in that they cannot replicate their genome enough to propagate and sufficiently infect a host. However, the viral genes are still expressed in the host's cell through a single replication cycle, allowing {{for the development of}} an immunity.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{evaluated}} the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of live <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> administered concurrently with measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine to healthy children 12 to 15 months of age. METHODS: Children were assigned randomly to receive (1) measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, varicella vaccine, and intranasal placebo on day 0, followed by 1 dose of live <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> on days 42 and 72; (2) measles-mumps-rubella, varicella, and live <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccines</b> on day 0, {{followed by a}} second dose of live <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> on day 42 and intranasally administered placebo on day 72; or (3) 1 dose of live <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> on days 0 and 42, followed by measles-mumps-rubella and varicella vaccines on day 72. Serum samples were collected before vaccination on days 0, 42, and 72. Reactogenicity events and adverse events were collected through day 41 after concurrent vaccinations and through day 10 after administration of live <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> or placebo alone. RESULTS: Among 1245 (99. 5 %) evaluable children, seroresponse rates and geometric mean titers for measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine were similar with concurrent administration of live <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> or placebo (seroresponse rates of > or = 96 % for measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and > or = 82 % for varicella vaccine in both groups). Hemagglutinin-inhibiting antibody geometric mean titers and seroconversion rates to influenza strains in live <b>attenuated</b> influenza virus <b>vaccine</b> were similar after the vaccine was administered alone (seroconversion rates of 98 %, 92 %, and 44 % for H 3, B, and H 1 strains, respectively) or with measles-mumps-rubella and varicella vaccines (seroconversion rates of 98 %, 96 %, and 43 %). The incidences of reactogenicity events and adverse events were similar among treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent administration of live <b>attenuated</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> with measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine provided equivalent immunogenicity, compared with separate administration, and was well tolerated.
