George developed Blücher, a locomotive working at Killingworth colliery in 1814, whilst Robert was instrumental in the design of Rocket, a revolutionary design that was the forerunner of modern locomotives. Both men were involved in planning and building railway lines, <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>this</b> country and abroad.|$|E
25|$|The boom in Cuba's sugar {{industry}} in the 19th century made it necessary {{for the country to}} improve its transportation infrastructure. Planters needed safe and efficient ways to transport the sugar from the plantations to the ports, in order to maximize their returns. Many new roads were built, and old roads were quickly repaired. Railroads were built relatively early, easing the collection and transportation of perishable sugar cane. It was now possible for plantations <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>this</b> large island to have their sugar shipped quickly and easily.|$|E

There were several indications of increased defensive preparations on the coastal sector; improvements were made to the Afule to Haifa railway and there was increased road traffic <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>this</b> district while the trench system near Kakon was not being maintained. The smallest details of roads and tracks immediately opposite the British front and crossings of the important Nahr Iskanderuneh were all carefully observed.|$|E

In his major study of English domestic architecture, Das Englische Haus, published some twenty years after Burges's death, Hermann Muthesius wrote of The Tower House, [...] "Worst of all, perhaps, is the furniture. Some of {{it is in the}} earlier manner, some of it box-like and painted <b>all</b> <b>over.</b> <b>This</b> style had now become fashionable, though with what historical justification {{it is not easy to}} say".|$|E

As the water began flowing, Halprin waded into the water, dressed in a jacket and tie. Jane Jacobs, author of The Death and Life of Great American Cities, mayor Terry Schrunk, and PDC chairman Ira Keller attended the fountain opening. In 2003, an article by Randy Gragg in The Oregonian summarized the moment, saying: ...|$|E

[...] The failure of the Peace Conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated. Lincoln said as the war was ending: ...|$|E

500|$|The special has {{received}} generally good reviews. Dan Martin of The Guardian {{noted that it}} was [...] "the smallest– yet perhaps the most enchanting– Christmas special we've had to date". Noting that it featured a typical [...] "doomed spaceship", the threat was not to the universe but one family's happiness, and the only enemies were [...] "some misguided and underdeveloped polluters", he concluded that [...] "Any other time of year I would gnaw holes <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>this,</b> but it's Christmas, and today it felt perfect". He felt that Skinner held the episode together {{and the appearance of}} Amy [...] "made Christmas all the more special". However, his [...] "major niggle" [...] was that everything was the Doctor's fault, as he left the present while knowing that most children would open their presents before Christmas. Michael Hogan, writing for The Telegraph, gave the special four and a half out of five stars. He thought that the cast of comedians were [...] "rather under-utilised" [...] but thought that Skinner [...] "excelled" [...] and Smith was also [...] "brilliant".|$|E
500|$|Tom Burns of UGO {{deemed the}} episode as [...] "one {{of the strongest}} hours of Supernatural all season", feeling that [...] "the actors really stepped up their game...and sold every moment". He also noted the [...] "unapologetically emotional" [...] Ackles, who [...] " [...] his joy, sadness, and anxiety <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>this</b> face, but always [...] things real and in character". Though Burns {{believed}} that [...] "wish-world" [...] stories have been overused in fiction, he felt that Ackles' [...] "hardcore acting chops" [...] allowed the episode to [...] "escape from mediocrity". The [...] "outstanding" [...] and [...] "well crafted" [...] episode was given a 7 out of 7 by TV Squad's Brett Love. He considered the djinn as [...] "one of the better representations" [...] of genies in popular culture, and noted that the creature had the [...] "perfect creepy look to it". He {{was pleased to see}} Smith and Palicki return, and found the character of Carmen to be [...] "a nice addition to the family". Don Williams of BuddyTV agreed, and ranked the episode third in his list of the best episodes of the first three seasons. Deeming it the best standalone episode, he noted that it [...] "can be embraced by anyone who enjoys clever writing, great acting, or a shirtless Jensen Ackles".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, the {{recording}} finds Spears [...] " [...] {{through the early}} throes of love." [...] Adam R. Holz of Plugged In claimed that the song is [...] "about Spears and a partner 'bangin' all over [...] bedroom,' which {{can be seen in}} the lines, [...] "Clumsy, bangin' <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>this</b> bedroom again and again." [...] Sasha Geffen of MTV added that during the track, Spears shows off her [...] "flirty side" [...] with lines like, [...] "I love how you go down." [...] Spin Andrew Unterberger explained that the lyrics of [...] "Clumsy" [...] "offer varying degrees of double-entendred literalness within the clumsiness conceit, as Britney’s lack of physical dexterity leads to her 'slippin’ off this dress." [...] Writing for Bustle, Alexis Rhiannon noticed that the text of {{the recording}} is [...] "frankly pretty filthy" [...] and [...] "also essentially a description of pure sex." [...] For the pre-chorus, Spears sings, [...] "Call me a fool/ Call me insane/ But don't call it a thing/ Closer to you/ Closer to pain/ It's better than far away", following which she repeats [...] "clumsy" [...] as a hook. During every breakdown of the track, the singer [...] "playfully squeals", [...] "Oops!", making reference to her 2000 song [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again". Throughout the track, Spears delivers vocals in her [...] "nasal come-on tone" [...] as noted by Rolling Stone Jon Blistein. The critic furthermore opined that the song [...] "marks a rhythmic, almost swing-inspired turn for Spears." ...|$|E

2500|$|Albino bias is also alleged {{in modern}} times. For example, the 2003 Warner Bros movie The Matrix Reloaded {{featured}} two sociopathic characters with pale skin and white hair frequently interpreted to be albinos despite studio declarations {{that they are}} not. [...] Positive depictions of albinos in mass culture are rarer, though {{one example is the}} 1995 film Powder which depicts an exceptionally gifted albinistic youth and the cruelty he endures from [...] "normal" [...] people because of his differences. In recent years, the National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation (NOAH) has spoken out against albino bias in the United States. [...] Albinistic actor Michael C. Bowman, of Me, Myself and Irene, has said, [...] "Kids <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>this</b> country are being affected in a very negative and harmful way because of the sloppiness and laziness of a writer in Hollywood." ...|$|E
2500|$|The song {{received}} polarizing {{reviews from}} music critics. Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine praised {{the composition of}} the song, writing [...] "Harris's electro fingerprints are <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>this</b> one — it plays like a straight house track, with some dreamy Rihanna vocals added in over the beat." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator commented on the song's lyrics, with particular emphasis on the line [...] "We found love in a hopeless place", writing that it is possibly the best lyric in pop music so far in 2011. A reviewer for Instinct magazine praised the song, writing that [...] "We Found Love" [...] does not mark a departure from the dance-floor oriented material Rihanna debuted on Loud, but it certainly boasts [...] "a higher-energy, peak-hour vibe". Similarly, Michael Cragg of The Guardian commented that the song takes the dance direction Rihanna hinted at on [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] and continues releasing similar songs, making reference to [...] "We Found Love". Cragg also likened the song to Leona Lewis's recent single, [...] "Collide", but criticized the song's structure, writing [...] " [...] is slightly odd". He ended his review writing, [...] "Either way, she could have recited Nick Clegg's conference speech from Wednesday over the sound of Harris cracking his knuckles {{and it would be a}} hit." ...|$|E

2500|$|Referencing {{contemporary}} Western {{views on}} gender diversity, psychologist Diane Ehrensaft states: [...] "I am witnessing a shake-up {{in the mental}} health community as training sessions, workshops and conferences are proliferating <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>this</b> country and around the world, demanding that we reevaluate the binary system of gender, throw out the idea that gender nonconformity is a disorder, and establish new guidelines for facilitating the healthy development of gender-creative children." [...] Child-adolescent psychiatrist Edgardo Menvielle and psychotherapist Catherine Tuerck offer a support group for parents of gender non-conforming children at the Children's National Medical Centre in Washington D.C., aimed [...] "not at changing children's behaviours but at helping parents to be supportive". Other publications are beginning to call for a similar approach, to support parents to help their child become their authentic self. Community organizations established to support these families have begun to develop, such as Gender Spectrum, Trans Youth Family Allies, Gender Creative Kids Canada, and Trans Kids Purple Rainbow, as well as conferences such as Gender Odyssey Family Conference and summer camps such as Camp Aranu'tiq, all with the goal of supporting healthy families with gender non conforming or transgender children. Popular media accounts of parents assisting their children to live in their felt gender role have recently begun to emerge. These stories demonstrate that children and their parents face substantial stigma; however, Menvielle maintains that [...] "the therapist should focus on helping the child and family cope with intolerance and social prejudice, not on the child's behaviours, interests or choice of playmates". A host of new terms being applied to these children (such as gender variant), gender non-conforming, gender-creative and gender-independent) indicates that many are beginning to reject the label of Gender Identity Disorder in Children.|$|E
