25|$|WR is {{associated}} with abnormalities in bone maturation, and lipids and hormone metabolism. Affected individuals exhibit intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, leading to short stature and an aged appearance from birth. They have physical abnormalities including a large head (macrocephaly), sparse hair, prominent scalp veins, inward-folded eyelids, widened anterior fontanelles, hollow cheeks (malar hypoplasia), general loss of fat tissues under the skin, delayed tooth eruption, <b>abnormal</b> <b>hair</b> pattern, beaked noses, mild to severe mental retardation and dysmorphism.|$|E
25|$|Vesiculo-erosive skin disease. This—a {{reference}} to the characteristic blistering (vesicles) and open sores (erosions) noted in patients—is the pattern seen in CEP, PCT, VP, and HCP. The changes are noted only in sun-exposed {{areas such as the}} face and back of the hands. Milder skin disease, such as that seen in VP and HCP, consists of increased skin fragility in exposed areas with a tendency to form blisters and erosions, particularly after minor knocks or scrapes. These heal slowly, often leaving small scars that may be lighter or darker than normal skin. More severe skin disease is sometimes seen in PCT, with prominent lesions, darkening of exposed skin such as the face, and hypertrichosis: <b>abnormal</b> <b>hair</b> growth on the face, particularly the cheeks. The most severe disease is seen in CEP and a rare variant of PCT known as hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP); symptoms include severe shortening of digits, loss of skin appendages such as hair and nails, and severe scarring of the skin with progressive disappearance of ears, lips, and nose. Patients may also show deformed, discolored teeth or gum and eye abnormalities.|$|E

2500|$|Acquired {{generalized}} hypertrichosis commonly {{affects the}} cheeks, upper lip, and chin. [...] This form also affects the forearms and legs, but is less common in these areas. Another deformity associated with acquired generalized hypertrichosis is multiple hairs occupying the same follicle. It may also include <b>abnormal</b> <b>hair</b> growth patterns as {{what happens to}} the eyelashes in a condition known as trichiasis. Oral minoxidil treatments for hypertension are known to cause this condition. Topical minoxidil used for alopecia causes hair growth in the areas where it is applied, however this hair disappears shortly after discontinuing the use of topical minoxidil.|$|E
2500|$|Acute {{cases of}} {{hepatitis}} {{are seen to}} be resolved well within a six-month period. When hepatitis is continued {{for more than six}} months it is termed chronic hepatitis. Chronic hepatitis is often asymptomatic early in its course and is detected only by liver laboratory studies for screening purposes or to evaluate non-specific symptoms. As the inflammation progresses, patients can develop constitutional symptoms similar to acute hepatitis, including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, and joint pain. Jaundice can occur as well, but much later in the disease process and is typically a sign of advanced disease. Chronic hepatitis interferes with hormonal functions of the liver which can result in acne, hirsutism (<b>abnormal</b> <b>hair</b> growth), and amenorrhea (lack of menstrual period) in women. Extensive damage and scarring of the liver over time defines cirrhosis, a condition in which the liver's ability to function is permanently impeded. This results in jaundice, weight loss, coagulopathy, ascites (abdominal fluid collection), and peripheral edema (leg swelling). Cirrhosis can lead to other life-threatening complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, [...] hepatorenal syndrome, and liver cancer.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{study of}} eight members of one family with Marie Unna hypotrichosis {{occurring}} in five generations. All affected individuals were born with widespread facial “milia”, sparse scalp hair and decreased body hair. Laboratory studies including urinary amino acids and plasma testosterone were normal. On histologic examination the hair follicles of the scalp showed proliferation of the internal root sheath and horn pearl formation in the lower third of the follicle. <b>Abnormal</b> <b>hairs</b> were flat and ribbon-like and twisted at irregular intervals. Extensive peeling of the cuticle was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. Electron microscopy of the hair shafts revealed intracellular fractures of the cuticular cells, increased interfibrillar matrix and fractures of the cortical cell fibrils and fractures of the medullary cells. X-ray diffraction studies were normal. On amino acid analysis of affected hairs a small decrease in cysteine-cystine {{and an increase in}} methionine content was noted. Since the hair shafts are clearly abnormal in this disorder, the name hereditary trichodysplasia is suggested. The condition is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{hair from}} 15 patients with trichothiodystrophy (TTD), a rare inherited disorder with brittle, cystine-deficient hair. They had {{a wide variety}} of phenotypes, from brittle hair only to severe intellectual impairment and developmental delay. Polarizing light microscopic examination showed alternating light and dark (tiger tail) bands under polarizing microscopy. Confocal microscopy captured structural features of breaks in intact TTD hairs. The autofluorescent appearance was regular and smooth in normal donors and markedly irregular in sections of TTD hairs possibly reflecting abnormalities in melanin distribution. Scanning electron microscopy revealed numerous surface irregularities. All TTD hair samples had reduced sulfur content. We observed an inverse correlation (Rval= 0. 9) between sulfur content and percent of hairs with shaft abnormalities (trichoschisis, trichorrhexis nodosa, or ribbon/twist). There was no association between clinical disease severity and percent of <b>abnormal</b> <b>hairs.</b> Raman spectra of hairs from TTD patients and normal donors revealed a larger contribution of energetically less favored disulfide conformers in TTD hairs. Our data indicate that the brittleness of the TTD hair is dependent upon abnormalities at several levels of organization. These changes make TTD hairs excessively prone to breakage and weathering...|$|R

5000|$|Hypotrichosis ( [...] + [...] + [...] ) is a {{condition}} of <b>abnormal</b> <b>hair</b> patterns - predominantly loss or reduction. It occurs, most frequently, by the growth of vellus hair {{in areas of the}} body that normally produce terminal hair. Typically, the individual's hair growth is normal after birth, but shortly thereafter the hair is shed and replaced with sparse, <b>abnormal</b> <b>hair</b> growth. The new hair is typically fine, short and brittle, and may lack pigmentation. Baldness may be present by the time the subject is 25 years old.|$|E
40|$|Trifluralin, {{a widely}} used {{herbicide}} (Rahman, 1977), may act via interaction with plant microtubule protein (Hess and Bayer, 1974, 1977). In trifluralin treated seedlings of Trifolium repens, root tips increased {{in diameter and}} decreased in length, cell elongation was decreased, cell wall deposition was <b>abnormal,</b> root <b>hairs</b> were deformed, and a marked reduction {{was seen in the}} number of infection threads induced by the bacterial symbionts. Our observations support the hypothesis that trifluralin (at low concentrations, from 2 x 10 (- 6) M) interferes with microtubule-based morphogenetic processes in developing seedlings and adversely affects the establishment of the bacteria-legume symbiosis...|$|R
50|$|Skin changes: Skin changes {{occur in}} 68% to 89% of POEMS {{syndrome}} patients. These changes most commonly are hyperpigmentation and/or hypertrichosis (<b>abnormal</b> amount of <b>hair</b> {{growth over the}} body) but less commonly include glomeruloid hemangioma, signs or symptoms of Hypervolemia (e.g. edema and ascites), acrocyanosis (blue discoloration of the extremities due to blood flow abnormalities), flushing, and/or white nails.|$|R
40|$|The Drosophila wing {{is covered}} by an array of {{distally}} pointing hairs that {{has served as a}} key model system for studying planar cell polarity (PCP). The adult cuticular hairs are formed in the pupae from cell extensions that contain extensive actin filaments and microtubules. The importance of the actin cytoskeleton for hair growth and morphogenesis is clear from the wide range of phenotypes seen in mutations in well-known actin regulators. Formin proteins promote the formation of long actin filaments of the sort thought to be important for hair growth. We report here that the formin encoding diaphanous (dia) gene {{plays a key role in}} hair morphogenesis. Both loss of function mutations and the expression of a constitutively active Dia led to cells forming both morphologically <b>abnormal</b> <b>hairs</b> and multiple hairs. The conserved frizzled (fz) /starry night (stan) PCP pathway functions to restrict hair initiation and activation of the cytoskeleton to the distal most part of wing cells. It also ensures the formation of a single hair per cell. Our data suggest that the localized inhibition of Dia activity may be part of this mechanism. We found the expression of constitutively active Dia greatly expands the region for activation of the cytoskeleton and that dia functions antagonistically with multiple wing hairs (mwh), the most downstream member of the fz/stan pathway. Further we established that purified fragments of Dia and Mwh could be co-immunoprecipitated suggesting the genetic interaction could reflect a direct physical interaction...|$|R

2500|$|Hypertrichosis (also called Ambras syndrome) is an <b>abnormal</b> {{amount of}} <b>hair</b> {{growth over the}} body.

50|$|Hay-Wells {{syndrome}} {{is the result}} of the invariant mutations of the p63 transcription factor that have been previously identified. Due to the diminished activities of p63, patients can experience a host of symptoms related to the operation of keratinocytes. In particular, the hypopigmentation observed in several Hay-Wells patients is believed to be the result of improperly developed keratinocytes not being able to properly interact with melanocytes. However, as it stands, this display of Hay-Wells syndrome has not been entirely comprehended. Most noted are the <b>abnormal</b> development of <b>hair,</b> teeth, glands, and nails.|$|R

40|$|Collagen VI is an {{extracellular}} matrix molecule that is abundantly {{expressed in the}} skin. However, the role of collagen VI in hair follicle growth is unknown. Here, we show that collagen VI is strongly deposited in hair follicles, and is markedly upregulated by skin wounding. Lack of collagen VI in Col 6 a 1 −/− mice delays hair cycling and growth under physiological conditions, but promotes wound-induced hair regrowth without affecting skin regeneration. Conversely, addition of purified collagen VI rescues the <b>abnormal</b> wound-induced <b>hair</b> regrowth in Col 6 a 1 −/− mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that the increased wound-induced hair regrowth of Col 6 a 1 −/− mice is triggered by activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and is abolished by inhibition of this pathway. These findings highlight the essential relationships between {{extracellular matrix}} (ECM) and hair follicle regeneration, and suggest that collagen VI could be a potential therapeutic target for hair loss and other skin-related diseases...|$|R
