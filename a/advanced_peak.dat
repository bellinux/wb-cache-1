40|$|We {{show that}} optical tachyonic {{dispersion}} corresponding to superluminal (faster than-light) group velocities characterizes parametrically amplifying media. The turn-on of parametric amplification in finite media, followed by illumination by spectrally narrow probe wavepackets, can {{give rise to}} transient tachyonic wavepackets. In the stable (sub-threshold) operating regime of an optical phase conjugator {{it is possible to}} transmit probe pulses with a superluminally <b>advanced</b> <b>peak,</b> whereas conjugate reflection is always subluminal. In the unstable (above-threshold) regime, superluminal response occurs both in reflection and in transmission, at times preceding the onset of exponential growth due to the instability. Remarkably, the quantum information transmitted by probe or conjugate pulses, albeit causal, is confined to times corresponding to superluminal velocities. These phenomena are explicitly analyzed for four-wave mixing, stimulated Raman scattering and parametric downconversion.

40|$|International audienceIn this study, we investigated, for {{the first}} time, the {{potential}} impact of environmental changes on zooplankton abundance over a fourteen year period (2000 – 2013) at an offshore station in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (the Levantine basin, offshore Lebanon). Samples were collected monthly and analyzed using the semi-automated system ZooScan. Salinity, temperature and phytoplankton abundance (nano and microphytoplankton) were also measured. Results show no significant temporal trend in sea surface temperature over the years. Between 2005 – 2010, salinity in the upper layer (0 – 80 m) of the Levantine basin increased (~ 0. 3 °C). During this 5 year period, total zooplankton abundance significantly increased. These modifications were concomitant to the activation of Aegean Sea as a source of dense water formation as part of the " Eastern Mediterranean Transient-like " event. The {{results of the present study}} suggested that zooplankton benefited from enhanced phytoplankton production during the mixing years of the event. Changes in the phenology of some taxa were observed accordingly with a predominantly <b>advanced</b> <b>peak</b> of zooplankton abundance. In conclusion, long-term changes in zooplankton abundance were related to the Levantine thermohaline circulation rather than sea surface warming. Sampling must be maintained to assess the impact of long-term climate change on zooplankton communities...|$|E
40|$|The {{timing of}} and {{relative}} investment in reproductive events are crucial fitness determinants for alpine plants, which have limited opportunities for reproduction {{in the cold}} and short growing seasons at high elevations. We use the alpine Anthyllis vulneraria to study whether flowering phenology and reproductive allocation have been under diversifying selection, and to assess genetic diversity and plastic responses to drought in these traits. Open-pollinated maternal families from three populations in each of two regions from the Swiss Alps with contrasting precipitation were grown in low and high soil moisture in a common garden. We measured onset, peak, and end of flowering, as well as vegetative and reproductive aboveground biomass. Population differentiation for each character (Q ST) was compared to differentiation at neutral microsatellite loci (F ST) to test for past selection. We found population differentiation in onset and peak of flowering which results from natural selection according to Q ST–F ST. End of flowering and biomass were not significantly differentiated among populations. Reduced soil moisture had no consistent effect on mean onset of flowering, and <b>advanced</b> <b>peak</b> and end of flowering by less than 1 week. Reproductive biomass was strongly decreased by lowered soil moisture. No genetic variation within or among populations was found for plasticity in any trait measured. The results suggest past heterogeneous selection on onset and peak of flowering in alpine Anthyllis vulneraria and potentially indicate local adaptation to differences in snowmelt date over distances < 5 km. Limited variation in plastic responses to reduced soil moisture suggests that soil moisture might not vary between populations...|$|E
40|$|Many {{migratory birds}} {{have changed their}} timing of arrival at {{breeding}} grounds in response to recent climate change. Understanding the adaptive value and the demographic consequences of these shifts are key challenges. To address these questions we extend previous models of phenological {{adaptation to climate change}} under territory competition to include feedback from population dynamics, winter survival and habitat productivity. We study effects of improved pre-breeding survival and of earlier food abundance peak. We show that phenological responses depend strongly on equilibrium population density via effects on territory competition. When density is high, improved pre-breeding survival affects selection pressures more than shifts of the resource peak. Under certain conditions, an <b>advanced</b> food <b>peak</b> can even select for later arrival due to competitive release. Improved pre-breeding survival has positive effects on population density that in many cases is stronger than negative effects of an <b>advanced</b> food <b>peak.</b> The fraction of young in the population decreases in all scenarios of change, but food peak shifts only affect population structure marginally unless population density is low. This work thus provides several missing links between phenological adaptation and demographic responses, and augments the toolbox for interpreting ongoing phenological shifts in migratory birds. We illustrate the utility of our model by explaining different patterns in demographic trends and phenological shifts in populations of Pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) across Western Europe...|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} in size of human populations in urban and agricultural areas {{has resulted in}} considerable habitat conversion globally. Such anthropogenic areas have specific environmental characteristics, which influence the physiology, life history, and population dynamics of plants and animals. For example, the date of bud burst is advanced in urban compared to nearby natural areas. In some birds, breeding success is determined by synchrony between timing of breeding and peak food abundance. Pertinently, caterpillars are an important food source for the nestlings of many bird species, and their abundance is influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and date of bud burst. Higher temperatures and advanced date of bud burst in urban areas could <b>advance</b> <b>peak</b> caterpillar abundance and thus affect breeding phenology of birds. In order to test whether laying date advance and clutch sizes decrease with the intensity of urbanization, we analyzed the timing of breeding and clutch size in relation to intensity of urbanization {{as a measure of}} human impact in 199 nest box plots across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East (i. e., the Western Palearctic) for four species of hole-nesters: blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), great tits (Parus major), collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis), and pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca). Meanwhile, we estimated the intensity of urbanization as the density of buildings surrounding study plots measured on orthophotographs. For the four study species, the intensity of urbanization was not correlated with laying date. Clutch size in blue and great tits does not seem affected by the intensity of urbanization, while in collared and pied flycatchers it decreased with increasing intensity of urbanization. This is the first large-scale study showing a species- specific major correlation between intensity of urbanization and the ecology of breeding. The underlying mechanisms for the relationships between life history and urbanization remain to be determined. We propose that effects of food abundance or quality, temperature, noise, pollution, or disturbance by humans may on their own or in combination affect laying date and/or clutch size...|$|R

This problem arises when searching for a mass spectrum in a database of theoretical mass spectra using the shared peaks count as similarity measure.

40|$|Phenological {{responses}} {{to climate change}} differ across trophic levels(1 - 3), which may lead to birds failing to breed {{at the time of}} maximal food abundance. Here we investigate the population consequences of such mistiming in the migratory pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca(4). In a comparison of nine Dutch populations, we find that populations have declined by about 90 % {{over the past two decades}} in areas where the food for provisioning nestlings peaks early in the season and the birds are currently mistimed. In areas with a late food peak, early-breeding birds still breed at the right time, and there is, at most, a weak population decline. If food phenology advances further, we also predict population declines in areas with a late food peak, as in these areas adjustment to an <b>advanced</b> food <b>peak</b> is insufficient(4).

The effect of scenario climate change on streamflow is explored through hydrological simulation.
