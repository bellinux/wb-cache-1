50|$|An <b>antistatic</b> <b>device</b> is any {{device that}} reduces, dampens, or {{otherwise}} inhibits electrostatic discharge; the buildup or discharge of static electricity, which can damage electrical components such as computer hard drives, and even ignite flammable liquids and gases.|$|E
50|$|An {{antistatic}} wrist strap, ESD wrist strap, {{or ground}} bracelet is an <b>antistatic</b> <b>device</b> used to safely ground a person working on very sensitive electronic equipment, {{to prevent the}} buildup of static electricity on their body, which can result in electrostatic discharge (ESD). It {{is used in the}} electronics industry by workers working on electronic devices which can be damaged by ESD, and also sometimes by people working around explosives, to prevent electric sparks which could set off an explosion. It consists of an elastic band of fabric with fine conductive fibers woven into it, attached to a wire with a clip on the end to connect it to a ground conductor. The fibers are usually made of carbon or carbon-filled rubber, and the strap is bound with a stainless steel clasp or plate. They are usually used in conjunction with an antistatic mat on the workbench, or a special static-dissipating plastic laminate on the workbench surface.|$|E

50|$|Some of polonium's {{applications}} {{relate to}} the element's radioactivity. For instance, polonium is used as an alpha-particle generator for research. Polonium alloyed with beryllium provides an efficient neutron source. Polonium is also used in nuclear batteries. Most polonium is used in <b>antistatic</b> <b>devices.</b> Livermorium {{does not have any}} uses whatsoever due to its extreme rarity and short half-life.|$|R
5|$|Polonium was {{discovered}} in 1898 by Marie and Pierre Curie, when it was extracted from uranium ore and identified solely by its strong radioactivity: {{it was the first}} element to be so discovered. Polonium was named after Marie Curie's homeland of Poland. Polonium has few applications, and those are related to its radioactivity: heaters in space probes, <b>antistatic</b> <b>devices,</b> and sources of neutrons and alpha particles. Polonium's intense radioactivity makes it dangerously toxic.|$|R
5000|$|Examples of non-ventilation {{engineering}} controls include placing equipment that may release nanomaterials {{in a separate}} room, and placing walk-off sticky mats at room exits. [...] <b>Antistatic</b> <b>devices</b> can be used when handling nanomaterials to reduce their electrostatic charge, making them less likely to disperse or adhere to clothing. Standard dust control methods such as enclosures for conveyor systems, using a sealed system for bag filling, and water spray application are effective at reducing respirable dust concentrations.|$|R
50|$|ESD {{can cause}} a range of harmful effects of {{importance}} in industry, including gas, fuel vapour and coal dust explosions, as well as failure of solid state electronics components such as integrated circuits. These can suffer permanent damage when subjected to high voltages. Electronics manufacturers therefore establish electrostatic protective areas free of static, using measures to prevent charging, such as avoiding highly charging materials and measures to remove static such as grounding human workers, providing <b>antistatic</b> <b>devices,</b> and controlling humidity.|$|R
5000|$|Radioactive {{sources have}} {{a wide range of}} uses in {{medicine}} and industry, and it is common for the design (and nature) of a source to be tailored to the specific application. Hence, it is impossible to state with confidence what the [...] "typical" [...] source looks like or contains. For instance, <b>antistatic</b> <b>devices</b> include beta and alpha emitters: polonium containing devices have been used to eliminate static electricity in such devices as paint spraying equipment. An overview of the gamma sources used for radiography can be seen at Radiographic equipment, and it is reasonable to consider this to be a good overview of small to moderate gamma sources.|$|R
50|$|Another {{version of}} the symbol has the {{triangle}} surrounded by an arc. This variant is {{in reference to the}} <b>antistatic</b> protective <b>device,</b> such as an antistatic wrist strap, rather than the component being protected. It usually does not feature the hand being crossed out, indicating that it makes contact with the component safe.|$|R
5000|$|An {{antistatic}} {{floor mat}} or ground mat {{is one of}} a number of <b>antistatic</b> <b>devices</b> designed to help eliminate static electricity. It does this by having a controlled low resistance: a metal mat would keep parts grounded but would short out exposed parts; an insulating mat would provide no ground reference and so would not provide grounding. Typical resistance is on the order of 105 to 108 ohms between points on the mat and to ground. [...] The mat would need to be grounded (earthed). This is usually accomplished by plugging into the grounded line in an electrical outlet. It's important to discharge at a slow rate, therefore a resistor should be used in earthing the mat. The resistor, as well as allowing high-voltage charges to leak through to earth, also prevents a shock hazard when working with low-voltage parts. Some ground mats allow you to connect an antistatic wrist strap to them. Versions are designed for placement on both the floor and desk.|$|R
40|$|DE 19823511 A UPAB: 20000118 NOVELTY - A screw {{conveyor}} and <b>antistatic</b> <b>devices</b> {{are used to}} control the rate of addition of the material to the air stream. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The material is stored in a vessel with a conical base to lead the material towards a dosing screw (19) which passes the material through a bush (24) to a nozzle (2) into which atmospheric air is led at an air inlet (4). A pipe carries the mixture to an injector (27) activated by compressed air with which it forms the aerosol. The conical base of the storage vessel is ribbed, and the air entering nozzle (2) can be electrically charged, to counter static charges produced within the material. Dosing can be varied by altering {{the speed of the}} dosing screw motor or mounting screws with different pitches and thread depths. A swing arm (26), running close to the walls of the storage vessel, is attached to the screw shaft. The equipment is intended for small-scale operation with a material usage between 2 g/h and 10 mg/h. USE - For the small-scale production of fiber, or powder, containing aerosols. ADVANTAGE - Precise control of the material concentration is possible...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNT) based polymer composites {{have emerged}} as the future multifunctional materials in view of its exceptional mechanical thermal and electrical properties. One of the major interests is to develop conductive polymer composites preferably at low concentration of CNT utilizing their high aspect ratio (LID) for numerous applications, which include <b>antistatic</b> <b>devices,</b> capacitors and materials for EMI shielding. In this context polymer blends {{have emerged as}} a potential candidate in lowering the percolation thresholds further by the utilization of 'double-percolation' which arises from the synergistic improvements in blend properties associated with the co-continuous morphology. Due to strong inter-tube van der Waals' forces, they often tend to aggregate and uniform dispersion remains a challenge. To overcome this challenge, we exploited sodium salt of 6 -aminohexanoic acid (Na-AHA) which was able to assist in debundlling the multiwall carbon nanotubes (MANT) through 'cation-pi' interactions during melt-mixing leading to percolative 'network-like' structure of MWNT within polyamide 6 (PA 6) phase in co-continuous PA 6 /acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) blends. The composite exhibited low electrical percolation thresholds of 0. 25 wt% of MWNT, the lowest reported value in this system so far. Retention of 'network-like structure' in the solid state with significant refinement was observed even at lower MWNT concentration in presence Na-AHA, which was assessed through AC electrical conductivity measurements. Reactive coupling {{was found to be}} a dominant factor besides 'cation-pi' interactions in achieving low electrical percolation in PA 6 /ABS+MWNT composites...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{belongs in}} the field of nanotechnologies and more specifically regards production of new nanostructured and graphene-based materials, presenting controlled electrical, electromagnetic, and electromechanical properties. In particular, the present invention regards formulation and production of a water-based polymeric paint, which has controlled electrical or else piezoresitive or else electromagnetic properties, starting from a commercial water-based polymeric paint or else from a water-based polymeric liquid solution filled with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), obtained by means of exfoliation of expanded graphite. Said paint can be used in electromagnetic-shielding applications (for example, for producing radar-absorbent materials â€“ RAMs) or else for producing <b>antistatic</b> <b>devices</b> or piezoresistive coatings for distributed monitoring of the state of strain of a structure. In addition to the aforesaid electrical, piezoresistive, and electromagnetic characteristics, the coats thus obtained are light, easy to process, and suitable for being laid on any substrate. All the purposes of the invention have been achieved through the process according to Claims 1 to 13. The process developed for producing said paint is simple, inexpensive, fast, and suitable for low-cost mass production. Moreover, it makes use of alcohol-water mixtures as solvent. It envisages the following steps: a) 	subjecting commercial graphite intercalation compound (GIC) to thermal expansion to obtain known structures such as TEGO, WEG, or expanded graphite (EG), or else using EG of a commercial type; b) 	dispersing and shredding said TEGO, WEG, or EG structures in water-based paint/ polymer possibly diluted with alcohol-water mixture, in variable concentrations according to the desired final properties; and c) 	subjecting the suspension to ultrasonication, wherein the parameters of the sonication cycle such as the temperature of the suspension, the energy released and the duration are defined {{on the basis of the}} properties of the material that is to be obtained. The paint can be laid with multiple techniques, such as, by way of non-limiting example, spraying, dip-coating, and ink-jet. Advantageously, according to the invention, it is possible to control the electrical, piezoresistive, and electromagnetic properties of the coating obtained with said paint through: 1. 	the amount of GNPs dispersed within the matrix; 2. 	appropriate definition and concentration of the alcohol-water mixture used as solvent; and 3. 	control of the dispersion of the GNPs within the paint, wherein said control is obtained through the sequential action of a mechanical rod stirrer, which has the function of shredding the expanded graphite in suspension, and of a sonicator with ultrasound tip, which has the function of exfoliating and dispersing the expanded graphite previously shredded...|$|R
