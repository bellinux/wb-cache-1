5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Milk {{emphasized}} that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and violence against them. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting <b>angry,</b> <b>or</b> mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E

In particular, [...] "angry white men" [...] stereotypically oppose affirmative action policies and third-wave feminism.|$|R

25|$|Allow {{time to let}} {{off steam}} - It is {{possible}} that one party may feel <b>angry</b> <b>or</b> frustrated {{at some point during}} the negotiation. Rather than try to avoid discussing those feelings, allow the individual to talk it out. Sitting and listening, without providing too much feedback to the substance itself, can offer enough support for the person to feel better. Once the grievances are released, it may become easier to negotiate.|$|E
25|$|During negotiations, anger {{disrupts}} {{the process by}} reducing the level of trust, clouding parties' judgment, narrowing parties' focus of attention and changing their central goal from reaching agreement to retaliating against the other side. Angry negotiators pay less attention to opponent's interests and are less accurate in judging their interests, thus achieve lower joint gains. Moreover, because anger makes negotiators more self-centered in their preferences, it {{increases the likelihood that}} they will reject profitable offers. Opponents who get really <b>angry</b> (<b>or</b> cry, or otherwise lose control) are more likely to make errors: make sure they are in your favor.|$|E
25|$|Kierski's {{research}} {{claimed that}} men do acknowledge that male fear of the feminine can have a strong influence on both hetero- and homosexual men. The research has also indicated that {{there appears to be}} a link between fear of the feminine and men's negative views about counseling and psychotherapy. In addition, this research has identified four possible groups of experiences that lead to male fear of the feminine, which relate to internal and external triggers. These are: Experiencing vulnerability and uncertainty; women who are strong and competent; women who are <b>angry</b> <b>or</b> aggressive; women who are like their mothers.|$|E

25|$|The {{amygdala}} {{is part of}} the {{limbic system}} which is related to fear cognition and emotional learning. Individuals with social anxiety disorder have been found to have a hypersensitive amygdala; for example in relation to social threat cues (e.g. perceived negative evaluation by another person), <b>angry</b> <b>or</b> hostile faces, and while waiting to give a speech. Recent research has also indicated that another area of the brain, the anterior cingulate cortex, which was already known {{to be involved in the}} experience of physical pain, also appears to be involved in the experience of 'social pain', for example perceiving group exclusion. A 2007 meta-analysis also found that individuals with social anxiety had hyperactiviation in the amygdala and insula areas which are frequently associated with fear and negative emotional processing.|$|E
25|$|Marilyn taught Genie to {{take her}} {{frustration}} out on inanimate objects in their yard and worked to verbally deescalate her, and as Genie learned more language she began to gain more control over her responses to situations that upset her. By {{the end of her}} stay with the Riglers she could gesture to indicate her level of anger, either vigorously shaking one finger or loosely waving her hand depending on whether she was very <b>angry</b> <b>or</b> merely frustrated. In mid-October 1971 Curtiss was reading Genie a story when she saw Genie was clearly listening and responding, and from then on Genie paid attention to people talking even when they were not speaking directly to or about her. As she settled down with the Riglers she began to talk somewhat more, and her response time began to improve, but she continued to speak significantly less than most children in similar phases of language learning.|$|E

500|$|Brown {{sought to}} reflect the Rhino's simplistic {{thinking}} style in his voice. He believes [...] "the quintessential 'thug' was played by William Bendix in The Glass Key. The simpler the character, the simpler the thought process. That means Rhino's 'motivation' is never too complicated he's very elemental. He's mad or happy or <b>angry</b> <b>or</b> sad or hungry or whatever. And it never gets beyond his appetites or ego." [...] Brown considers that Bendix's performance perfectly portrayed this type of character.|$|E
500|$|Crawford {{was often}} {{irritable}} and some colleagues found him exasperating to work with. He {{was known for}} his lack of patience, and when <b>angry</b> <b>or</b> frustrated was known to fling his hat to the floor in a gesture of rage. His biographer Kitty Hauser noted that [...] "apparently trifling events left an indelible mark on him", for he would remember a perceived slight for decades. Bowden expressed the view that while Crawford [...] "had a quick temper, which he strove to control... he was essentially a friendly man", adding that he could be [...] "clubbable, hospitable and kind".|$|E
500|$|The {{notion that}} Vikings used A.muscaria to produce their berserker rages was first {{suggested}} by the Swedish professor Samuel Ödmann in 1784. Ödmann based his theories on reports {{about the use of}} fly agaric among Siberian shamans. The notion has become widespread since the 19th century, but no contemporary sources mention this use or anything similar in their description of berserkers. Muscimol is generally a mild relaxant, but it can create a range of different reactions within a group of people. It is possible that it could make a person <b>angry,</b> <b>or</b> cause them to be [...] "very jolly or sad, jump about, dance, sing or give way to great fright".|$|E

500|$|The call {{is mostly}} uttered in flight {{and is a}} harsh [...] "tsak tsak tsuk". The same sound, but softer, is made more conversationally when {{individuals}} gather in trees. When <b>angry</b> <b>or</b> alarmed they emit various warning sounds reminiscent of the mistle thrush (Turdus viscivorous). The male has a rather feeble song that he sings in the breeding season. It {{is a mixture of}} a few phrases like those of the common blackbird (Turdus merula) interspersed with whistles, guttural squeaks and call notes. This is sung on the wing and also from a tree and a subdued version of this song with more warbling notes is sung by a group of birds at communal roosts.|$|E
500|$|The American press {{considered}} True Detective to {{be among}} the best television shows of 2014. Many critics complimented the work of both lead actors, often singling out McConaughey for further praise, with his work described as [...] "jaw-droppingly great" [...] and [...] "simply magnetic". [...] Some reviewers singled out simple conversational scenes, often in claustrophobic interiors, as some of the best acting in the series. The characterization received mixed reviews: Cohle's speeches, described by HuffPost as [...] "mesmerizing monologues", and by Vanity Fair as dense and interesting material, were criticized by the New York Post as [...] "'70s-era psycho-babble" [...] which slowed down the story. [...] Several critics viewed the portrayals of women as stereotypical: [...] "either <b>angry</b> <b>or</b> aroused", though Michele Monaghan was praised for her performance in a [...] "thankless role".|$|E
500|$|Williams's role in AC/DC was {{to provide}} steady but basic bass lines which {{followed}} the rhythm guitar of Malcolm Young, consisting mostly of eighth notes. His basslines were sometimes written by Malcolm and Angus Young during composition, {{and at other times}} Williams developed them based on the other instrumental tracks. Williams said he plays [...] "the same thing in every song, for the most part. In AC/DC's music, the song is more important than any individual's bit in it." [...] He added that [...] "complex [...] lines wouldn't add anything to a guitar-oriented band like ours, so I try to create a bottom layer that drives what our guys are doing on top." [...] Williams had no difficulty keeping his low profile within the band, declaring that [...] "I don't have any problem doing this, because I enjoy playing simply. I never feel <b>angry</b> <b>or</b> prisoner." [...] His playing technique was mostly centred around downpicking, with occasional use of plucking to mute the strings, which he says [...] "adds more definition and tightens up the notes, and it gives the sound less sustain".|$|E

500|$|Of {{the four}} other songs from West Side Story, [...] "Tonight" [...] was given an [...] "A−" [...] and called [...] "pretty wonderful" [...] by Benigno, while Futterman thought it [...] "very sweet, yet very vanilla" [...] and West gave it a [...] "B" [...] and noted it [...] "was lacking something". Slezak gave the musical's songs a {{collective}} grade of [...] "A". Although others praised Santana as Anita, Futterman was not impressed with her rendition of [...] "A Boy Like That" [...] and wrote, [...] "Santana's part of the song is not nearly <b>angry</b> <b>or</b> urgent enough and sounds like a watered-down version of what Santana is capable of". West gave the song a [...] "B+", and stated that the song was [...] "stellar for Rachel's fire". Futterman singled out Rachel for [...] "I Have a Love": [...] "Rachel delivers the best vocals of the night with her powerful, yet incredibly high soprano that sounds effortless despite being out of her normal range." [...] Benigno and West both gave [...] "One Hand, One Heart" [...] an [...] "A"; the former called it [...] "wonderful", although he railed about the prevalence of show tunes in the episode, and the latter wrote, [...] "This was the perfect soundtrack to the trio of first times." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite his contributions, his {{captaincy}} {{and coaching}} methods came under immense scrutiny {{from the press}} {{as well as other}} scholars. Engel commented that [...] "He seems like aloof to the problems that his mal-decisions are creating. I don't particularly believe that Ganguly has an 'effing knowledge how to lead his team and tries to counter-pose it with instigating limitless, confrontational behaviours within the younger members of it. [...] the time will come when such shock tactics will cease to work." [...] An article on Cricinfo Magazine pointed out his reckless behaviour. The reporter Rahul Bhattacharya said, [...] "Generally Ganguly fostered <b>angry</b> <b>or</b> reckless young men. To him 'good behaviour', a broad term espoused by the present team management, belonged in school and probably not even there. He himself had been summoned to the match referee no less than 12 times in the last decade. His approach was bound to precipitate what could possibly be termed a cultural conflict in the world of modern sport. For Ganguly, like for Arjuna Ranatunga, competitiveness involved brinksmanship rather than training. As far as they were concerned Australia were not to be aspired to. They were simply to be toppled. England were not to be appeased. Victory lay precisely in their disapproval. In other words, Ganguly and Ranatunga wanted to do things their way." ...|$|E
500|$|When Philomena Goins Doctor {{found out}} what her son had done, she became enraged and {{threatened}} to disown him, shook him, then slapped him. A year later, Moore took the story to CBS' 60 Minutes, and was the background reporter on a piece produced by Joel Bernstein and narrated by African-American journalist Ed Bradley. Philomena Doctor called her family members and declared Moore's story and Bradley's television exposé were full of lies. A psychologist at the University of Florida later testified in state hearings that the survivors of Rosewood showed signs of posttraumatic stress disorder, made worse by the secrecy. Many years after the incident, they exhibited fear, denial, and hypervigilance about socializing with whites—which they expressed specifically regarding their children, interspersed with bouts of apathy. Despite such characteristics, survivors counted religious faith as integral to their lives following the attack in Rosewood, {{to keep them from}} becoming bitter. [...] Michael D'Orso, who wrote a book about Rosewood, said, [...] "veryone told me in their own way, in their own words, that if they allowed themselves to be bitter, to hate, it would have eaten them up." [...] Robie Mortin described her past this way: [...] "I knew that something went very wrong in my life because it took a lot away from me. But I wasn't <b>angry</b> <b>or</b> anything." ...|$|E
