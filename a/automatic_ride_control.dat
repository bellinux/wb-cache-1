50|$|The {{speed was}} {{verified}} by the USAF ARIS radar. It also fired the Navy's first vertically launched missile (an SM-2) while doing 60 knots (110 km/h). It {{was also used}} to test <b>automatic</b> <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> and high speed collision avoidance and navigation systems. The 100A ship {{was used to test}} waterjet propulsion, variable geometry inlets and <b>automatic</b> <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> systems. The 100A and 100B were both capable of operating almost completely out of the water on an air cushion with only 18in (46 cm) of sidewall, the propellers or the waterjet inlets entering the water. The 100-ton SES 100B was built for the US Navy as a 1/10 scale model to test the feasibility of using hovercraft and other Surface Effect Ships in combat situations. The top-secret specifications called for a ship capable of entering a combat zone at a speed of over 80 knots (150 km/h) and disgorging a tank and 100 soldiers onto a beach, turning back out onto water and escaping at high speed.|$|E

5000|$|The model lineup {{was further}} changed; {{to bring the}} Thunderbird in line with other Ford models, the Elan was dropped, {{replaced}} with LX and Sport versions. The LX was equipped with the V6 while the Sport was equipped with the V8. Turbo Coupes gained an intercooler, essentially giving the car the powertrain of the Ford Mustang SVO. Versions with the 5-speed manual were given a power increase to 190 hp, reaching {{a top speed of}} 143 mph. Versions with the 4-speed automatic transmission (new for 1987) were detuned to 150 hp in the interest of transmission durability; turbocharger boost was reduced to 9.5 psi (65 kPa or 0.65 bar) instead of 10-15 psi (70 to 100 kPa or 0.7 to 1 bar). Turbo Coupes were equipped with anti-lock 4-wheel disc brakes, <b>Automatic</b> <b>Ride</b> <b>Control,</b> and 16-inch 225/60VR performance tires. The Turbo Coupe also featured a performance-styled front valance with fog lights and special trim with [...] "Turbo Coupe" [...] badges on the doors, as well as [...] "Snowflake" [...] 16 inch alloy wheels.|$|E

40|$|Seasickness {{has always}} been a serious issue for people prone to motion sickness. Obviously if {{passenger}} comfort could be improved, they would easily get on board such as a car. The design of the <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> system for a fishing vessel presents special problems due to the need to optimize the arrangement of actuator. In addition, the effect of this system sometimes gives a different reputation among the shipbuilder, ship-owner and fishermen. The main reason is {{that they do not have}} a common long measure related to seasickness. In this paper, a new evaluation method of the <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> system for a fishing vessel has been proposed from the viewpoint of human engineering. The method evaluates the amplitude of accelerations, their frequencies and the influence of exposure duration. The point about the development of this method takes into account the influence of exposure duration during the boarding time. In the evaluation method, the effect of <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> system is quantitatively discussed among the shipbuilder, ship-owner and fishermen. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{operation}} of high-speed catamarans in large waves can produce significant vessel motions {{that can lead}} to passenger discomfort as well as extreme loadings during full bow immersion and wave slam impact. This not only can generate large bending loads on the hull structure but also has significant effects on the fatigue life of the vessel. These large loads and motions can be effectively reduced through the implementation of a <b>Ride</b> <b>Control</b> System (RCS) that can significantly reduce the extreme loads sustained by the hull girder and reduce the incidence of motion sickness for passengers on-board the vessel. Although <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> systems have been implemented on full-scale catamaran vessels, the parameters that influence the response have not been previously quantified partly due to the limitations of testing at full-scale. To accurately investigate these parameters it is needed to undergo testing in controlled conditions and to this end a 2. 5 m scaled catamaran model has been developed with an active <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> system based on the 112 m INCAT catamaran to investigate the system parameters influencing the response of the vessel. The 2. 5 m hydroelastic segmented catamaran model was set-up with an active T-Foil and stern tab <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> system specifically for towing tank testing at the Australian Maritime College (AMC) to determine the motions and loads response in headseas. Step and frequency responses of the <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> system were first investigated by calm water open-loop tests to determine the control gains needed for closed-loop active control tests. Appropriate combinations of the control surface deflections were then determined to produce pure heave and pure pitch response forming the basis for setting the gains of the <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> system to implement different control algorithms in terms of the heave and pitch motions in encountered waves. Two hydrostatic methods were applied to predict the T-Foil and stern tab responses based on a static load experiment and a hydrostatic prediction and there was close agreement between the two outcomes. This was extended by a dynamic prediction of the response of the moving model based on a two degree of freedom rigid body analysis using strip theory. A series of model tests in head seas at different wave heights and frequencies was then undertaken at the AMC towing tank for different <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> conditions including without RCS, passive RCS and active RCS to measure the heave and pitch motions as well as the centre bow slam force and the demihull slam induced bending moments. Three different <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> algorithms of heave control, local control and pitch control were developed to activate the model scale <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> surfaces in a closed loop control system configuration. The response amplitude operators (RAOs) as well as the response phase operators (RPOs) of the model were evaluated from the heave and pitch data. In addition to the RAOs and RPOs, the amplitude and phase of control surfaces were analysed in order to present the range of control surface deflection as well as the phase lag between the control surfaces deflection and the model motions. Comparing the results of the model without RCS with the results of the model with a passive RCS {{it was found that the}} deployment of the T-Foil to a fixed position and acting as a passive control surface reduces the peak heave and pitch motions. As expected heave and pitch were more strongly reduced by their respective control algorithms. This was more evident in the pitch control mode where it significantly reduced the pitch RAO. The centre bow slam force and the demihull slam induced bending moments were also significantly reduced by implementing the pitch control mode. The motion and load results obtained through this unique and comprehensive investigation of a catamaran model fitted with the model scale <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> system have clearly demonstrated the positive effects of using improved <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> algorithms on the vessel motions and loads response. This consequently has a direct impact on the design of future catamaran vessels allowing ship designers to optimise the structural design of the vessel whilst improving passenger comfort and reducing the incidence of motion sickness in particular when operating in larger waves...|$|R

40|$|A new {{gyroscopic}} {{method of}} active <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> on marine vehicles is presented. Gyroscopic stabilisation is selected because it acts entirely within {{the hull of}} the vessel while not requiring sufficient movable weight to generate control moments. The new approach is capable of generating greater stabilising moments than existing gyroscopic systems. Physical experiments, using a modulation theory approach, on a ship model practically demonstrate that the specified system is capable of providing levels of <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> comparable with existing systems. Theoretical estimates of the system on full-scale vessels demonstrate its practical feasibility for application on small and medium sized vessels...|$|R
