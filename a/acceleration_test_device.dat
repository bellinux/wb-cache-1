40|$|On {{the basis}} of the theoretic {{deduction}} and corresponding reasonable assumption, a mathematic model was built according to the flight model of exterior trajectory to improve the angular tracing precision of rotating mirror house in a streak camera. A <b>test</b> <b>device</b> was designed and developed for the angular tracing precision of rotating mirror house in the streak camera. The measuring principle of the <b>test</b> <b>device</b> was introduced, the angular tracing precision was measured by the developed device and the uncertainty factors of the <b>tested</b> <b>device</b> were analyzed. The tested results show that the angular tracing precision of the high speed rotating mirror in the streak camera is (0. 34 ± 0. 06) °, the relative uncertainty of the <b>tested</b> <b>device</b> is 3. 0 ″ and the main error sources come from interpretation and servo control.

Experimental photoelastic patterns recorded {{by a high}} speed camera were compared with those simulated by dynamic elastic Finite Element (FE) analysis. The positive results of this comparison validated the FE analysis. It is demonstrated that when the initial acceleration of the specimen is low (using a damper in the loading device), static analysis can be applied for both testing speeds used. In high <b>accelerations</b> <b>tests</b> (without damper used), a transient dynamic stress state in the specimens is found, therefore a dynamic analysis should be used.

40|$|AbstractThe {{acceleration}} {{delivered to}} the bracket are measured on the expressway, national highway, local road, city street, and unpaved road. The measured acceleration signals are analyzed virtual damage and frequencies by extending the 160, 000 km. For the accelerated vibration <b>test,</b> the <b>acceleration</b> <b>test</b> of {{six degrees of freedom}} (DOF) in the time domain using MAST and the <b>acceleration</b> <b>test</b> of single-DOF in the frequency domain using single axis equipment are performed. The measured PG acceleration signals as same as virtual damage of the 160, 000 km, are used for the accelerated test of six DOF. The axis which shows the maximum virtual damage value from real road test is used for the single-DOF test. The tests are performed by enveloping and amplifying PSD lines of real roads after analyzing frequencies. No failure is found in the six-DOF <b>acceleration</b> <b>tests.</b> However in single-DOF tests, the connection part between the battery and bracket had been broken. It is the reason why the chosen test axis is with the maximum virtual damage values in analyzing the real roads.

With regard to the proton data, {{it is noted that}} the data are often limited to one proton energy, since the tests were usually motivated by the engineering requirement of comparing similar candidate devices for a system. It is noted that many of the devices exhibited no upset for the given test conditions (the maximum fluence and the maximum proton energy Ep are given for these cases). It is believed, however, that some possibility of upset usually exists because there is a slight chance that the recoil atom may receive up to 10 to 20 MeV of recoil energy (with more energy at higher Ep) ...|$|R
40|$|A compact injector, {{designed}} for a medical accelerator complex, was constructed.

40|$|Background: To {{compare the}} {{diagnostic}} efficacy of commercially available rapid diagnostic <b>test</b> <b>devices</b> for Dengue serology. To {{find out the}} sensitivity and specificity of rapid diagnostic devices with Elisa results as the Gold standard. Methods: During the dengue virus epidemic in Lahore a pilot {{study was conducted in}} order to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of two most frequently used immunochromatographic rapid <b>test</b> <b>devices</b> in public sector hospitals. The results of both the kits were compared to each other. Sensitivity and specificity was calculated against results of ELISA as the reference gold standard. Results: Results of kit-A revealed a very high false negative rate when compared to ELISA where actual prevalence rate shown by ELISA was 96. 0 % compared to prevalence rate of 44. 0 % with rapid diagnostic <b>test</b> <b>device</b> kit-A. Similarly the results of rapid <b>test</b> <b>device</b> Kit-B showed high false negative results for dengue virus prevalence.

40|$|Automotive {{infotainment}} {{systems are}} automotive equipment manufactured with narrow tolerances. Besides the hardware itself, the components that {{interact with the}} user and {{with the rest of}} the car have to fulfil strict requirements. These components are the buttons face plate and the pins connector. The buttons must fulfil haptics requirements of force and stroke in order that the feeling of pressing them would be the same as the rest car buttons’ feeling. The pins connector must fulfil force requirements in order that ergonomic and resistance characteristics would be achieved. These characteristics must be measured to verify whether the prototypes are within required tolerances in order to produce the infotainment system model. Developing a <b>test</b> <b>device</b> to check the force and stroke characteristics of infotainment systems is the aim of this project. Having its own forcestroke <b>test</b> <b>device</b> in the Panasonic headquarter in Langen would speed up the process of verification and modification of the infotainment systems prototypes and would simplify the design task. To develop the suitable <b>test</b> <b>device</b> required, the characteristics of both kind of test have been taken into account. The button test and the pins connector tests have very different requirements. On one hand, the button test requires high resolution, accuracy and repeatability and its range of force is from 0 N to 10 N. On the other hand, the pins connector tests require applying higher force, from - 125 N to 450 N, being negative for pulling and positive for pushing. Moreover, these kinds of tests do not require sensors resolution and accuracy as high as those for the button test. Taking into account these requirements, a stable and stiff <b>test</b> <b>device</b> with an actuator, two force sensors and a displacement sensor has been developed. The simplicity of the device was a necessity due to the stability and the low cost required. Apart from the design and development of the <b>test</b> <b>device,</b> the application interface has also programmed, using LabVIEW software. The software for controlling and getting the result of the button test has already been developed and is totally functional. However, the software of the pins connector tests will be the next tasks to achieve. Although the repeatability of the <b>test</b> <b>device</b> is acceptable, its accuracy must be tested by a certification company, in order to validate the <b>test</b> <b>device</b> performance. To sum up, this <b>test</b> <b>device</b> has been a good inversion. Panasonic has got a low cost <b>test</b> <b>device</b> with which the company will save money, the infotainment systems will not be tested by an external company, and time, the <b>test</b> <b>device</b> will speed up the verification and modification process of prototypes...|$|R
