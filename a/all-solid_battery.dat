The future directions of electrode materials for LIBs should focus on exploring new types of lithium-ion redox couples with different electrode reaction mechanisms and designing novel structures and morphologies {{in order to further}} increase battery energy/power densities, enhance charge/discharge rate capability, improve service life and safety, and reduce the cost at the same time. The 3 D nanoarchitectured cells, in which pillared anodes and cathodes are interdigitated, have already attracted much interest.

40|$|Effective {{passivation}} of lithium metal surfaces, {{and prevention}} of battery-shorting lithium dendrite growth, are critical for implementing lithium-metal-anodes for batteries with increased power densities. Nanoscale surface heterogeneities can be "hot spots" where anode passivation breaks down. Motivated by the observation of lithium dendrites in pores and grain boundaries in <b>all-solid</b> <b>batteries,</b> we examine lithium metal surfaces covered with Li(2) O and/or LiF thin films with grain boundaries in them. Electronic structure calculations show that, at > 0. 25 V computed equilibrium overpotential, L(2) O grain boundaries with sufficiently large pores can accommodate Li(0) atoms which aid electron leakage and passivation breakdown. Strain often accompanies Li-insertion, applying a ~ 1. 7 % strain already lowers the computed overpotential to 0. 1 V. Lithium metal nanostructures as thin as 12 Angstroms are thermodynamically favored inside cracks in Li(2) O films, becoming "incipient lithium filaments. " LiF films are more resistant to lithium metal growth. The models used herein should in turn inform passivating strategies in all-solid-state batteries...|$|R
40|$|Lithium-ion {{conducting}} argyrodites Li 6 PS 5 X (X = Cl, Br, I) are {{a promising}} class of fast-ion conductors for <b>all-solid</b> state Li-ion <b>batteries.</b> To gain a deeper {{insight into the}} phase formation of Li 6 PS 5 Cl, in situ neutron diffraction studies are carried out on a stoichiometric ball-milled precursor mixture during thermal treatment. The evolution of the S 2 −/Cl− anion disorder and its correlation with ionic conductivity are reported here. In contrast to earlier reports, an argyrodite phase is found to form between 80 and 150 °C, but the phase shows only moderate conductivity when crystallized at such low temperatures and further thermal treatment is required to access the highly conducting phase. The maximum room-temperature ionic conductivity of 1. 1 × 10 − 3 S/cm is observed for samples annealed at intermediate temperatures (250 °C). When ball-milled glass-ceramic precursors for Li 6 PS 5 Cl are crystallized with a constant slow heating rate, the initially formed argyrodite phase {{is found to be}} Li 7 PS 6, which is then gradually converted into Li 6 PS 5 Cl at higher temperatures. The industrial requirements for minimizing cost by using lower annealing temperatures thus need to be balanced with the requirements of obtaining the highest conducting composition of the phase for performance in <b>all-solid</b> state <b>batteries.</b> © 2012, Elsevier B.

40|$|Here we {{demonstrate}} that by regulating {{the mobility of}} classic −EO− based backbones, an innovative polymer electrolyte system can be architectured. This polymer electrolyte allows the construction of all solid lithium-based polymer cells having outstanding cycling behaviour in terms of rate capability and stability {{over a wide range}} of operating temperatures. Polymer electrolytes are obtained by UV-induced (co) polymerization, which promotes an effective interlinking between the polyethylene oxide (PEO) chains plasticized by tetraglyme at various lithium salt concentrations. The polymer networks exhibit sterling mechanical robustness, high flexibility, homogeneous and highly amorphous characteristics. Ambient temperature ionic conductivity values exceeding 0. 1 mS cm− 1 are obtained, along with a wide electrochemical stability window (> 5 V vs. Li/Li+), excellent lithium ion transference number (> 0. 6) as well as interfacial stability.

40|$|This is {{the first}} {{quantitative}} analysis of mechanical reliability of <b>all-solid</b> state <b>batteries.</b> Mechanical degradation of the solid electrolyte (SE) is caused by intercalation-induced expansion of the electrode particles, within the constrain of a dense microstructure. A coupled electro-chemo-mechanical model was implemented to quantify the material properties that cause a SE to fracture. The treatment of microstructural details {{is essential to the}} understanding of stress-localization phenomena and fracture. A cohesive zone model is employed to simulate the evolution of damage. In the numerical tests, fracture is prevented only if electrode-particle's expansion is lower than 7. 5 % and the solid-electrolyte's fracture energy higher than $G_c = 4 $ J m$^{- 2 }$. Perhaps counter-intuitively, the analyses show that compliant solid electrolytes (with Young's modulus in the order of E$_{SE} = 15 $ GPa) are more prone to micro-cracking. This result, captured by our non-linear kinematics model, contradicts the speculations that sulfide SEs are more suitable for the design of bulk-type batteries than oxide SEs. Mechanical degradation is linked to the battery power-density. Fracture in solid Li-ion conductors represents a barrier for Li transport, and accelerates the decay of rate performance...|$|R

Here we offer a summary of our recent results on the synthesis, physico-chemical and electrochemical characterization of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) based on different monomers/oligomers (methacrylic and/or ethylene oxide based) with specific amounts of lithium salt, plasticizers and/or fillers. Profoundly ionic conducting (σ > 10 - 4 S cm- 1 at 20 °C), electrochemically stable (> 5 V vs. Li), self-standing, tack-free SPEs are successfully prepared via a rapid and easily up-scalable process including a light induced polymerization step. Crosslinking allows the incorporation of high amounts of plasticisers (e. g., RTILs) and lithium salt (based on TFSI- anion), leading to materials with remarkable characteristics in terms of homogeneity and mechanical robustness under highly stressful conditions. Lab-scale Li-polymer cells show stable charge/discharge characteristics without any capacity fading at C/ 5 current regime (> 130 mAh g- 1 in LiFePO 4 /Li configuration and > 150 mAh g- 1 in TiO 2 /Li configuration even @ 20 °C).

40|$|Lithium-stuffed garnets attract huge {{attention}} due {{to their}} outstanding potential as solid-state electrolytes for lithium batteries. However, there exists a persistent challenge in the reliable synthesis of these complex functional oxides together {{with a lack of}} complete understanding of the lithium-ion diffusion mechanisms in these important materials. Addressing these issues is critical to realizing the application of garnet materials as electrolytes in all solid-state lithium-ion batteries. In this work, a cubic phase garnet of nominal composition Li 6. 5 Al 0. 25 La 2. 92 Zr 2 O 12 is synthesized through a microwave-assisted solid-state route for the first time, reducing considerably the reaction times and heating temperatures. Lithium-ion diffusion behavior is investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and state-of-art muon spin relaxation (mSR) spectroscopy, displaying activation energies of 0. 55 0. 03 eV and 0. 19 0. 01 eV respectively.   This difference arises from the high inter-grain resistance, which contributes to the total resistance in EIS measurements. In contrast, mSR acts as a local probe providing insights on the order of the lattice, giving an estimated value of 4. 6210 &#x 100000; 11 cm 2 s&#x 100000; 1 for the lithium diffusion coefficient.

Free radical photo-polymerization (UV-curing) can be an interesting alternative process to produce polymer electrolytes for Li-ion batteries (LIBs). It {{can be carried out}} at ambient temperature where a liquid polyfunctional reactant with a photo-initiator undergo polymerization to obtain a cross-linked film. It is an excellent technique due to its easiness in processing and eco-friendliness as the solvents are not used. Hereby, ion conducting, self-standing and tack-free ethylene oxide based polymer electrolytes encompassing a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) and/or tetraglyme (G 4) with specific amounts of lithium salt are successfully prepared via a rapid UV curing process. All materials are characterized in terms of their physical, chemical and morphological properties, following galvanostatically cycling in lab-scale lithium batteries.

40|$|All-solid-state {{rechargeable}} {{lithium-ion batteries}} have attracted much interest {{because they have}} features particularly favorable for large-scale application to automotive applications and to stationary load-leveling for intermittent power generation from solar or wind energy. The replacement of an organic liquid electrolyte with a nonflammable and more reliable inorganic solid electrolyte (SE) simplifies the battery design and improves safety and durability of the system [1]. However, the mechanical behavior of such electrodes will be considerably different than their liquid electrolyte counterparts. Direct stacking of solid-state cells enables the achievement of high operating voltages in a reduced volume. Furthermore, all-solid-state batteries allow the use of large-capacity electrode materials, for instance, sulfur positive electrode paired with a lithium metal negative electrode, which are difficult to employ in conventional liquid electrolyte batteries. A key development {{to the success of}} all-solid-state batteries is a SE with high Li+ ion conductivity at room Temperature [2, 3, 4]. In recent years, several SEs having the same level of conductivity as organic liquid electrolytes have been discovered and tested with many active materials. The durability of a cohering solid–solid interface between electrode and electrolyte is likely to be important practical consideration. Notwithstanding the several techniques have been investigated to increase the contact area at the interface [5], interface cohesion and its effects on the rate capability and the overall performance throughout the expected life cycles needs to be maintained. This research focuses on the development of a nonlinear continuum model able to account for the combined effects of Li diffusion and for the consequent isotropic or anisotropic volumetric expansion of the hosting material. The electrode and electrolyte are modeled as idealized as elastic-viscoplastic materials, with elastic properties varying with lithium concentration. A discrete approximation of such a model has been implemented (in the framework of finite elements) to simulate mechanical and elctrochemical response of the system. Side reactions being mostly inhibited in <b>all-solid</b> cells, the <b>battery</b> life depends in larger measure on the mechanical integrity of the composite system [6]. As physical values for the SE’s mechanical behavior are not available, our calculations indicate trends of how mechanical reliability will depend on temperature-dependent viscoelastic behavior. When mechanical properties become available, they can be used directly in our model. Of relevant practical interest is thus the prediction of stress, plastic flow, and damage within the bulk and in particular at the electrode–electrolyte interface.

40|$|A wide {{interest}} is mounting {{in the field}} of polymer electrolytes, due to their application in energy efficient devices such as rechargeable batteries, photo-electrochemical cells, electrochromic devices, fuel cells and super capacitors. Polymer electrolytes exhibit unique advantages such as mechanical integrity, wide variety of fabrication methods in desirable size and shape, possibility to fabricate an intimate electrode/electrolyte interface and adapt to a lightweight, leak proof construction, safety and economic packaging structure. Free radical photo-polymerization (UV-curing) can be an interesting alternative process to produce polymer electrolytes for Li-ion batteries. It takes place at ambient temperature: a liquid polyfunctional monomer, containing a proper photo-initiator, forms a cross-linked film upon UV irradiation. It appears highly advantageous, due to its easiness and rapidity in processing, very short time with high efficiency and eco-friendliness as the use of solvent is avoided. In the present work, profoundly ion conducting, self-standing and tack-free ethylene oxide based polymer electrolytes encompassing a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) with specific amounts of lithium salt are successfully prepared via a rapid and easily up-scalable UV curing process. All the prepared materials are thoroughly characterized in terms of their physical, chemical and morphological properties, and eventually galvanostatically cycled in lab-scale lithium batteries (LIBs). The appearance of the cross-linked polymer electrolyte is interesting, where the remarkable mechanical abusability is demonstrated. The crosslinking produced by UV irradiation allows the incorporation of higher amount of RTIL (imidazolium, pyrrolidinium etc.) and/or tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (tetraglyme) with lithium salt (based on TFSI- anion), leading to a material with remarkable morphological characteristics in terms of homogeneity and robustness. FESEM analysis was conducted to characterize the morphology of the photo cured polymer films. The typically wrinkled texture characteristics of highly amorphous, cross-linked polymer electrolytes is evidenced. The bright and dark areas in the image belong to amorphous PEO domains alternated to some residual ordered (semi crystalline) domains, respectively; the wrinkled texture derives from the formation of crosslinking domains between the polymer chains. Similar kind of textures are also present in polymer films kept at temperature under high stress (50 bar for 15 mins at 90 °C) during the preparation process. The UV-cured PEO-based polymer network is able to efficiently hold the RTIL without any leakage. Tensile analysis confirmed that the UV-irradiated membranes showed an average Young's modulus E of 0. 2 ± 0. 05 MPa. If one considers that more than 50 wt. % of ionic liquid is generally incorporated, these are highly satisfying values. The SPE showed the thermal stability up to 375 °C under inert conditions, and such a remarkable result is particularly interesting for application in Li-ion batteries with increased safety. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) was used to get further information on the fundamental role of photo curing step in reducing the overall crystallinity of the SPE to nearly fully amorphous state. The SPE exhibited excellent ionic conductivity (> 10 - 4 Scm- 1 at room temperature), electrochemical stability (> 5 V vs. Li+/Li), and interfacial stability. At 20 °C the conductivity value is equal to 2. 5 × 10 - 4 Scm- 1. This result is encouraging as it is sufficiently high to allow ambient temperature operation of Li-ion cells. It exceeds 10 - 3 Scm- 1 already at 50 °C. The Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher (VTF) behavior of the SPE was verified fitting the conductivity data with respect to temperature. The value of activation energy was found to be 8. 23 kJ mol- 1. The ability to resist the lithium dendrite nucleation and growth was tested by galvanostatic polarization studies. They showed resistance at current intensity > 0. 1 mAcm- 2. The lab-scale Li-polymer cell assembled showed stable charge/discharge characteristics without any capacity (135 mAh g- 1) fading at C/ 5 current regime (Figure 1 D).
