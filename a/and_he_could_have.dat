5|$|In {{his debut}} season in 2004, Hunt was {{approached}} {{to play at}} international level for New Zealand in the ANZAC Test match. Although {{he was born in}} New Zealand, he had played all of his rugby league in Queensland, Australia. He was therefore eligible to play for either New Zealand or Australia, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> also played for the Cook Islands or Samoa due to his parents' heritage. However, Hunt pledged his allegiance to Queensland, and therefore Australia, but was not selected for either country that season. Hunt became a possibility for the Australian squad for the 2004 Tri-Nations, but Bennett, who was the Australian coach, decided not to select him due to his inexperience. In 2006, media speculation suggested that Hunt intended to change his allegiance and play for the New Zealand team, but Hunt put the speculation to rest by confirming that he would play for Australia.|$|E
25|$|Servetus was {{gifted in}} {{languages}} <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> studied Latin and Greek under {{the instruction of}} Dominican friars. He also had a knowledge of Hebrew. At the age of fifteen Servetus entered {{the service of a}} Franciscan friar by the name of Juan de Quintana. In 1526 he attended the University of Toulouse where he studied law. Servetus could have had access to forbidden religious books, some of them maybe Protestant, while he was studying in this city.|$|E
25|$|The first American {{known to}} see the San Joaquin River was likely Jedediah Smith, a renowned {{mountain}} man, fur trapper and explorer. In 1826, Smith arrived in Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, California, when the region was under control of the Mexican government. As this was in violation of a law which prevented foreigners from entering California, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been arrested for spying, he traveled north into the San Joaquin Valley, searching for populations of beaver. Smith noted the fertility and natural beauty of the area, and the apparent peace of the Native Americans living in the villages he passed. His expedition then turned east {{in an attempt to}} cross the Sierra Nevada. They tried to summit the range by way of both the Kings River and the American River (a tributary of the Sacramento), but it was early spring and the snow was too deep. Finally, they crossed the mountains along the Stanislaus River canyon, becoming the first recorded whites to cross the Sierra Nevada on foot. It is still disputed over whether Smith's party discovered gold on the San Joaquin or one of its tributaries. Although some of his men confirmed it, Smith did not make any mention of the precious metal in his journal.|$|E
5000|$|Clearly, {{despite the}} criticism, he {{energized}} Urdu media scene. Questions remain about his agenda, intent <b>and</b> whether <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been more responsible.|$|R

60|$|Malcolm was on {{the whole}} rather relieved; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not help feeling guilty towards Patrick, <b>and</b> unless <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> full time for explanation, he {{preferred}} not falling in with him.|$|R
25|$|In 1966, due to uneven {{scheduling}} {{that left}} out new AAWU members Oregon and Oregon State, UCLA was 3–1 in conference games and 8-1 overall. The Bruins lost only one game, at Washington 16–3. USC was 5–0, but lost out of conference to Miami (Florida). It was widely {{assumed that the}} winner of the 1966 game between 8th ranked UCLA and 7th ranked USC would go to the 1967 Rose Bowl. UCLA star QB Gary Beban was out with a broken ankle, but backup Norman Dow, making his first and only start at QB, led UCLA to a 14–7 win. A vote the next Monday among the AAWU conference athletic directors put USC in the Rose Bowl. It was speculated that this was to make up for 1964 when Oregon State (8-2 overall, 4-1 in conference) was voted in ahead of USC (7-3 overall, 4-1 in conference) despite USC's 20-17 upset of #1 Notre Dame in the season's final game; the Oregon State coach at the time was Tommy Prothro, who became UCLA's coach in 1965. In addition, the directors believed Beban could not play for UCLA in the Rose Bowl due to the broken ankle, thereby giving the Big 10 representative (Purdue) a better chance to win. UCLA students protested by blocking the Northbound lanes of I-405 at Wilshire Boulevard. A week after the vote, USC made the voters look really bad as they lost to Notre Dame 51–0. This still stands as the worst defeat in USC Trojan football history. USC entered the Rose Bowl unranked and lost to Purdue, 14–13. Ironically, Beban's ankle had healed <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> played. UCLA finished fifth in both polls.|$|E
500|$|Hamlin, who {{finished}} second, said [...] "Hats off to Mike (Ford, crew chief) {{and this whole}} FedEx Office Camry team. We {{have a really good}} car, we just had to learn to stay in the pits. We just lost too many spots on pit road that we couldn't overcome that track position. I was trying to make something happen and got in the wall which ended up killing our car. The good part about that is I was able to save fuel because there was no pressure from behind. I was able to save fuel and our Camry got the best fuel mileage it got all day." [...] Kyle Busch's crew chief Dave Rogers said of his drivers' performance, [...] "I think he handled it well -- it's tough. You lead all these laps <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> gone for the clean sweep this weekend -- win all three in a row. He deserved to win all three in a row and to get beat -- it's tough.", he continued, [...] "We're disappointed -- this Toyota deserved to be in Victory Lane. I thought we had one of the best cars throughout the entire race, but it just didn't work out that way. We were a little short on fuel." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{appointment}} by John Major was 'non-political' (it was granted for {{services to the}} cinema) <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been a crossbencher, Attenborough chose to take the Labour whip and so sat on the Labour benches. In 1992 he had been offered a peerage by Neil Kinnock, then leader of the Labour Party, but refused it as he felt unable to commit himself to the time necessary [...] "to do what was required {{of him in the}} Upper Chamber, as he always put film-making first".|$|E

2500|$|In 1996, police exhumed {{the body}} of John Irvine McInnes, the cousin {{of one of the}} {{original}} suspects, from a graveyard in Stonehouse, South Lanarkshire. McInnes, who had served in the Scots Guards, had committed suicide aged 41 in 1980. He was found {{in a pool of blood}} after slashing his brachial artery in his upper arm. According to a psychiatrist at the time, this unusual type of suicide was akin to psychopathy <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> taken his own life in search of the [...] "ultimate thrill". Police ran a DNA test and compared it with semen found on Helen Puttock's tights and announced it to be inconclusive. Lord Mackay, then the Lord Advocate, said there was not enough evidence to link the murders with McInnes.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1929, just a {{year after}} the {{purchase}} of Cook Forest by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, McCreight proposed to the Bureau of Indian Affairs that Native Americans return to live in their historic natural home in Cook Forest along the Clarion River. The Seneca people of the Iroquois Confederacy once inhabited the great forest, and McCreight visioned man once again living in harmony with nature. It was also wonderful opportunity for McCreight’s Lakota friends to regularly visit The Wigwam, and he proposed that Good Face, William Spotted Tail, John Sitting Bull and Flying Hawk, with their families, be invited to live in Cook Forest. McCreight explained his proposal to the U.S. Indian Field Service of the Department of the Interior in Wood, South Dakota: [...] “I wish you would see Good Face and talk with him about the Cook Forest Park. [...] It is likely that he with his wife would very much enjoy coming to stay at least for a time in this beautiful place. He would be among the best people always and have all the rights and liberties that he would care for, and I am sure it would more than pay too. [...] The Clarion River runs through the property, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> his bark canoe, go fishing, if permitted, and his duties would be to watch the fires and act as a guide and keep up the trails, etc. I think it would be arranged that he would have a salary, and his wife would get considerable by selling bed work out to the tourists. [...] It was my idea that they could have not only a log house but tepee which they could move at will and there are many beautiful places along the river and in the forests, to camp in the summer.” ...|$|E
60|$|That {{about the}} {{children}} was true enough, Shefford thought, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> testified to it.|$|E
60|$|In another instant, <b>and</b> before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{scrambled}} to his feet, the dog {{would have had}} him by the throat but for Jet, {{who was on the}} alert for just such an accident.|$|R
60|$|He {{felt she}} would like him to come. That soothed him. They went, talking simply, <b>he</b> gentle <b>and</b> humble. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> wept with {{gratitude}} that she was deferential to him. He was feeling humiliated.|$|R
5000|$|Down Beat critic Don Gold {{wrote in}} his July 10, 1958 review that [...] "Kenton, in {{describing}} Holman's [...] "Royal Blue" [...] in the notes, terms it exciting, powerful, <b>and</b> positive. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been describing this band." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My God! ain't it a shame!" [...] went on Bostil, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> laughed aloud at his hypocrisy. He felt Lucy's {{blue eyes}} riveted upon his face.|$|E
60|$|The anger {{died out}} of Arthur's heart, {{and the warm}} blood rushed once more through his {{tingling}} body. Tears came to his eyes, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> embraced his defender.|$|E
60|$|His {{features}} were grave, {{but there was}} the gleam of a hidden laugh in {{his eyes as he}} spoke. Smith saw it, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> knocked him down for it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why {{should she}} have said your most {{uncommon}} name?' continued Owen. 'The man was evidently truthful, {{for there was}} not motive sufficient for his invention of such a tale, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> done it either.' ...|$|R
50|$|Arguably {{the most}} gifted of all Standardbreds <b>and</b> {{certainly}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been {{the greatest of}} all but he was troubled throughout his career by bad feet; this led to him losing interest in racing and his subsequent retirement.|$|R
60|$|It {{was as if}} {{his companions}} were engaged in some crime, instead of simply {{infringing}} a patent, the legality of which had not been fully tested, <b>and,</b> if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> had his choice, {{he would have been}} miles away from that spot just then.|$|R
60|$|Uncle John nearly rolled {{from his}} chair in an ecstacy of delight <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> shaken Mildred Travers for {{releasing}} {{the grip of the}} baby fingers and rescuing the major from torture.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the assault}} began, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{laughed at the}} way in which a couple of those cut-throats--neither wishing to have the honour of meeting him singly--hindered each other by seeking to attack him at once.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Kindness {{taught him}} courage,' said Albinia. 'It might perhaps have earlier taught him moral courage.

50|$|On April 28, 1991, the Phillies {{recorded}} the first triple-play {{in the history}} of Veterans Stadium. Tony Gwynn lined to second baseman Randy Ready. Ready stepped on second, <b>and</b> although <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> tagged the runner, threw to first baseman Ricky Jordan.|$|R
60|$|Stephen {{stood at}} the door of the porch <b>and</b> listened. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> heard the softest {{breathing}} of any person within the porch; nobody was there. He went inside the doorway, sat down upon the stone bench, and waited with a beating heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't; I {{think very}} little about it. I know what I think of. Put the watch in your pocket before the doctor comes. There; I hear his horse. Why didn't <b>he</b> drive over, <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> taken you back?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} I wanted you," [...] he said. She had known it, of course. The {{submarine}} bell had told her. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> found no woman in Newport {{who would have}} brought more enthusiasm to his aid than Elsie Shorter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless," [...] growled Little John, [...] "the holy Saint Swithin holdeth {{the waters}} of the heavens in his pewter pot, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> poured them out, had he chosen, even from a clear sky; and wouldst thou have had me wet to the skin?" ...|$|E

50|$|Hastings {{had a close}} {{relationship}} with his home city, Worcester, <b>and</b> although <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> developed an interesting, challenging and rewarding medical career anywhere including London or Edinburgh, he made a conscious decision to invest his career in the locality where he had grown up.|$|R
