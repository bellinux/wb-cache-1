500|$|Lee Tamahori {{was hired}} to direct Die Another Day; Barbara Broccoli admired his film Once Were Warriors, calling it [...] "a phenomenal piece of filmmaking". Broccoli noted that she and Wilson [...] "sensed his genuine enthusiasm for Bond. It was simply great chemistry. Lee was the right guy <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>very,</b> very lucky to get him". Screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade {{returned}} and began work {{in the summer of}} 2000 with the producers. They used a premise from Fleming's novel Moonraker as a basis, that of an industrialist villain who had two identities. With the planned release of the film being in the 40th anniversary year of the Bond film series, Tamahori named the Hong Kong hotel seen in the film the [...] "Rubyeon Royale", for Eon's ruby anniversary, as well as Fleming's first novel, Casino Royale.|$|E
500|$|After {{being placed}} in {{detention}} together, Lana and Sky came {{to know each other}} better. They gradually formed a bond, and Lana developed feelings for Sky. Lana's crush on Sky eventually culminated in Neighbours first lesbian kiss. The episode featuring the kiss was broadcast in its usual 6.30pm G-rated timeslot. The executive producer of Neighbours, Ric Pellizzeri, said the storyline reflected reality and continued the show's move toward more contemporary issues. Pellizzeri explained that Neighbours was simply telling [...] "a story about tolerance." [...] The producer added that the kiss was as far as they would go, but the writers would not be discouraged from telling other stories about homosexuality in the future. On-screen, Sky told Lana that she was only interested in her boyfriend, but they remained friends. With her main storyline completed, Lana was seen attending the prom with a female admirer, before moving to Canada with her family. Script producer Luke Devenish told a reporter for the Sydney Star Observer, [...] "There is that great tradition that the lesbian is always dead in the final scene, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> aware of that as we were writing her out. We wanted to avoid that at all costs." ...|$|E
500|$|Mega Man 4 was {{the first}} game in the series for Hayato Kaji, {{credited}} as [...] "K. Hayato", a prominent designer for many later Mega Man games.

[...] "We knew adding a two-level or three-level charge would change the whole flavor of the game in some respects, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> mindful of that," [...] Inafune explained. The Robot Masters in Mega Man 4 are a result of a design contest for fans held in Japan. With over 70,000 character submissions, the development team spent {{an extended period of time}} narrowing them down to only eight bosses. According to Kaji, the team was very satisfied with many of the chosen designs and almost no changes were made to their original illustrations. They were so impressed with Skull Man that they scrapped an entire level being created just so they could restart it and devote it to that Robot Master. The winning eight contestants of the design contest were each issued a special [...] "golden cartridge" [...] edition of Mega Man 4. As there are only eight of these cartridges in existence, they are extremely rare and fetch a large collector's price today. The musical score for Mega Man 4 was composed by Minae Fujii, credited as [...] "Ojalin", while the sound programming and sound effects were handled by Yasuaki Fujita, credited as [...] "Bun Bun", who had composed the soundtrack for Mega Man 3 the previous year.|$|E

2500|$|On August 13, 2014, Seth M. Sherwood was {{announced}} {{to write the}} film, under the title Leatherface. On October 31, 2014, Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo were hired to direct the film, who admired its distinction in narrative from the series' previous installments: [...] "When we first received the script, of course it's not everyday {{that you have the}} opportunity to see Leatherface on the front page <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> surprised, in a good way, that the script was taking a different path, and it's quite original." [...] Producer Whedon elucidated that the directors were chosen because their [...] "perfect vision" [...] and their [...] "edge to their storytelling". Upon signing on to the project, Maury and Bustillo requested rewrites, in which Sherwood gave his support. The general plot structure remained the same, though the directors wanted the screenplay to match their vision. Nearly every death sequence was altered and the ending, originally a mass murder involving Leatherface killing at least thirty people with his chainsaw, was changed, [...] "It was really over the top and even if we like blood and gore, we were like, no, that’s not the character, we cannot do that." [...] In March and April 2015, Sam Strike, James Bloor, Stephen Dorff, and Jessica Madsen joined the cast, respectively.
