5|$|Defenders of Ardania is a tower defense {{game that}} also has {{offensive}} real-time strategy elements. As with all tower defense games, the player must defend their home base by building {{several types of}} static tower units that fire at weak offensive units spawned by the opponent. In Defenders of Ardania, however, players must also spawn soldiers themselves. Like the opponent's soldiers, the player's soldiers move along a fixed path towards their opponent's base and cannot be directly maneuvered by the player. The game is won if units spawned by the player get past the opponent's towers <b>and</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>the</b> opponent's base before the opponent's units get past the player's towers <b>and</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>the</b> player's base.|$|E

5|$|According to Herodotus, {{after the}} loss of the battle Xerxes {{attempted}} to build a causeway across the channel to attack the Athenian evacuees on Salamis, but this project was soon abandoned.

His general Mardonius volunteered to remain in Greece and complete the conquest with a hand-picked group of troops, while Xerxes retreated to Asia with the bulk of the army. Mardonius over-wintered in Boeotia and Thessaly; the Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt-out city for the winter.|$|E

5|$|According to Herodotus, {{after this}} loss Xerxes {{attempted}} {{to build a}} causeway across the straits to attack Salamis (although Strabo and Ctesias place this attempt before the battle). In any case this project was soon abandoned. With the Persians' naval superiority removed, Xerxes feared that the Greeks might sail to the Hellespont <b>and</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>the</b> pontoon bridges. According to Herodotus, Mardonius volunteered to remain in Greece and complete the conquest with a hand-picked group of troops, while advising Xerxes to retreat to Asia with {{the bulk of the}} army. All of the Persian forces abandoned Attica, with Mardonius over-wintering in Boeotia and Thessaly. The Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt-out city for the winter.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Scheer's fleet, {{composed}} of 16 dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts, six light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats departed the Jade {{early on the}} morning of 31 May.

The British navy's Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation, and so sortied the Grand Fleet, totaling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, the night before in order to cut off <b>and</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>the</b> High Seas Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler summoned Lieutenant-General Kurt Student of the 7. Flieger-Division (7th Air Division) {{to discuss}} the assault. It was first {{suggested}} that a conventional parachute drop be made by airborne forces to seize <b>and</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>the</b> forts' guns before the land units approached. Such a suggestion was rejected as the Junkers Ju 52 transports were too slow and {{were likely to be}} vulnerable to Dutch and Belgian anti-aircraft guns. Other factors for its refusal were the weather conditions, which might blow the paratroopers away from the fort and disperse them too widely. A seven-second drop from a Ju 52 at minimum operational height led to a dispersion over 300metres alone.|$|E

The revised ending saw the Enterprise swoop in at the last minute to save Picard <b>and</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>the</b> collector ship with Ru'afo aboard. The studio liked the new ending but wanted a bigger space battle. The production team agreed providing they could postpone the release to allow enough time for this. Because the studio wanted Insurrection to be released in time for Christmas, no further revisions were made to the ending.|$|E
