By early March, just as the Partisans were forcing a crossing of the Neretva at Jablanica, Mihailović joined Ostojić. In a letter {{to one of his}} other Montenegrin Chetnik commanders, Mihailović stated that he was managing the whole operation through Ostojić, although Mihailović later denied that {{he was in charge of}} the operation when questioned during his trial by a Partisan court after the war. Mihailović and Ostojić realised that the large concentrations of Chetnik troops in and around Mostar and the nearby bauxite mines were likely to draw German attention, and while they were focused on this issue, the Partisans forced a crossing of the Neretva.|$|E
500|$|As {{the studio}} {{sessions}} progressed, the band members' new intimate relationships that formed after various separations started {{to have a}} negative effect on Fleetwood Mac. The musicians did not meet or socialise after their daily work at the Record Plant. At the time, the hippie movement still affected Sausalito's culture and drugs were readily available. Open-ended budgets enabled the band and the engineers to become self-indulgent; sleepless nights and the extensive use of cocaine marked much of the album's production. Chris Stone, one of the Record Plant's owners, indicated in 1997 that Fleetwood Mac brought [...] "excess at its most excessive" [...] by taking over the studio for long and extremely expensive sessions; he stated, [...] "The band would come in at 7atnight, have a big feast, party till1or2 in the morning, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were so whacked-out they couldn't do anything, they'd start recording".|$|E

2500|$|Partly {{because the}} group lived {{for three months}} in {{northeast}} Brazil, the band's first album shows clear influences of Brazilian music, mixed with symphonic rock and jazz. But the band's first live concert to support the album created {{one of the strangest}} anecdotes in Argentine rock: the fans did not understand the strange costumes the band used (entirely in white except for Garcia with a black jacket and shoes); <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> played the song [...] "Disco Shock", a satire poking fun at disco music (which was at its height in 1978), people thought they were really serious. Whistles and boos would follow and {{what should have been a}} great concert turned into a fiasco, with fans clamoring for Sui Generis songs. People failed to get the message and Serú Girán did not get their point across too well either. It would all fuel wild speculations about the members' sexual orientations, a PR nightmare at the time.|$|E

2500|$|Fleetwood Mac convened at the Record Plant February 1976 with hired {{engineers}} Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut. Most {{band members}} {{complained about the}} studio and wanted to record at their homes, but Fleetwood did not allow any moves. Despite his talent at keeping the group together, the recording of Rumours was fraught with emotional turmoil due to the collapsing relationships within the line-up. Christine McVie and Nicks decided to live in two condominiums near the city's harbour, while the male contingent stayed at the studio's lodge in the adjacent hills. Chris Stone, one of the Record Plant's owners, when the band jammed, recalled that [...] "The band would come in at 7atnight, have a big feast, party till1or2 in the morning, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were so whacked-out they couldn't do anything, they'd start recording". Fleetwood often played his drum kit outside the studio's partition screen to better gauge Caillat's and Dashut's reactions to the music's groove. After the final mastering stage and hearing the songs back-to-back, the band members sensed they had recorded something [...] "pretty powerful".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1940s Mona began {{traveling}} with Milt on {{tours of the}} Cab Calloway Orchestra, where Milt was a bassist from 1936 through the early 1950s. Mona was the only musician’s friend or spouse to travel with the band. She was a trusted confidant who was known for her discretion, and she quickly became a valuable resource for the musicians. [...] When the band was crossing the country doing a series of one-nighters, Mona was instrumental in arranging lodging and food for the musicians. [...] She would often go to the African-American section of town and find several women {{who were willing to}} cook for the band. [...] She would pay for the food, organize the cooks, and have the food packed and delivered to the performance venue in time for intermission. [...] Since this was the height of the Jim Crow era, and since many of the towns were too small to have hotels that allowed African-Americans, Mona would frequently make arrangements for band members to sleep in local homes. She also helped musicians in the band manage their money, often insisting that they open savings accounts. [...] As she put it, “I was like the den mother. I used to save their money — those who would drink and couldn’t handle it, I’d take their money away from them at night, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> got sober the next morning I’d return it to them.” ...|$|E
