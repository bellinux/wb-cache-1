5|$|An st-{{planar graph}} is a {{connected}} planar graph {{together with a}} bipolar orientation of that graph, <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> that makes it acyclic with a single source and a single sink, {{both of which are}} required {{to be on the same}} face as each other. Such a graph may be made into a strongly connected graph by adding one more edge, from the sink back to the source, through the outer face. The dual of this augmented planar graph is itself the augmentation of another st-planar graph.|$|E
5|$|The {{corresponding}} {{concept for}} undirected graphs is a forest, an undirected graph without cycles. Choosing <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> for a forest produces {{a special kind}} of directed acyclic graph called a polytree. However there are many other kinds of directed acyclic graph that are not formed by orienting the edges of an undirected acyclic graph. Moreover, every undirected graph has an acyclic orientation, an assignment of a direction for its edges that makes it into a directed acyclic graph. To emphasize that DAGs are {{not the same thing as}} directed versions of undirected acyclic graphs, some authors call them acyclic directed graphs or acyclic digraphs.|$|E
5|$|Due to the fog, {{visibility}} {{was low and}} the {{two main}} forces failed to notice Oxford's victory over Hastings. As such, {{the collapse of the}} Yorkist left wing had little (if any) effect on morale of either side. The fighting between Montagu's and Edward's groups was evenly matched and intense. The Lancastrian left wing, however, was suffering treatment similar to that Oxford had inflicted on its counterpart; Gloucester exploited the misaligned forces and beat Exeter back. Progress for Edward's brother was slow because his group was fighting up a slight slope. Nonetheless, the pressure he exerted on the Lancastrian left wing rotated the entire battle line. Warwick, seeing the shift, ordered most of his reserves to help ease the pressure on Exeter, and took the rest into fighting at the centre. Gradually, the battle line settled to <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> that slanted north-east to south-west.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} individual differences in learning to teach. Thirty secondary student teachers were interviewed about several components of their learning: mental models of learning to teach, learning activities, regulation in general, emotion regulation in particular, ideal self as a teacher and concerns. The interviews were qualitatively analysed, resulting in the identification of three to five categories per component. Homogeneity analysis demonstrated that many of these categories are related within individuals. Five orientations to learning to teach were discerned; <b>an</b> open meaning <b>orientation,</b> <b>a</b> closed meaning <b>orientation,</b> <b>an</b> open reproduction <b>orientation,</b> <b>a</b> closed reproduction <b>orientation,</b> and <b>a</b> survival <b>orientation.</b> The five orientations may be indicative of how progress in the quality of individual learning evolves.

30|$|Bearing these {{limitations}} in mind, the following general results are highlighted. First, <b>an</b> entrepreneurial <b>orientation</b> {{has been found}} to be positively associated with both product and marketing innovation intensity, which suggests that proactive and innovative firms are more likely to engage in new product development or implement changes in how products are marketed. We also find that <b>a</b> market <b>orientation</b> is positively associated with product and marketing innovation. This finding provides broader support for the link between marketing capabilities and innovation among SMEs (Banterle et al. 2011) by finding a similar linkage with respect to <b>a</b> market <b>orientation</b> to product and marketing innovation within another context. Furthermore, by modelling both <b>a</b> market <b>orientation</b> and <b>an</b> entrepreneurial <b>orientation,</b> we are able to observe how increases in these strategic resources may directly and indirectly influence expectations of future performance. For firms operating in highly competitive markets, developing <b>an</b> entrepreneurial <b>orientation</b> alongside <b>a</b> market <b>orientation</b> may enable the firm to become aware of and seize opportunities in new or rapidly evolving markets such as entomology-based protein chains (Pascucci et al. 2015).|$|R
5|$|Measuring the {{magnetic}} resonance of crystals first involved growing the crystals, a simple procedure often done by elementary school students. The crystals {{then had to}} be prepared by skillfully cutting them into sections with facets that had <b>an</b> <b>orientation</b> different from the internal structure of the crystal, and the response to a magnetic field had to be painstakingly measured. While his crystals were growing, Rabi read James Clerk Maxwell's 1873 A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, which inspired an easier method. He lowered a crystal on a glass fiber attached to a torsion balance into a solution whose magnetic susceptibility could be varied between two magnetic poles. When it matched that of the crystal, the magnet could be turned on and off without disturbing the crystal. The new method not only required much less work, it also produced a more accurate result. Rabi sent his thesis, entitled On the Principal Magnetic Susceptibilities of Crystals, to Physical Review on 16 July 1926. He married Helen the next day. The paper attracted little fanfare in academic circles, although it was read by Kariamanickam Srinivasa Krishnan, who used the method in his own investigations of crystals. Rabi concluded {{that he needed to}} promote his work as well as publish it.|$|E

Using a partial least squares structural equation model and data from a 2013 survey, this paper models the effect of <b>a</b> market <b>orientation</b> and entrepreneurial orientation on satisfaction with current performance and expected future performance for agricultural firms in Ontario, Canada. Our results show that <b>a</b> market <b>orientation</b> and entrepreneurial orientation are important factors in determining rates of product and marketing innovations among farm-based agribusinesses.
