5|$|By 1867, church {{authorities}} {{deemed the}} problems with the tower as severe enough to warrant a major reconstruction of the church. George Gilbert Scott, who had recently designed the monumental London buildings of the Foreign Office and St.Pancras Station, was chosen to lead the project. Scott was a leading <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gothic Revival and saw the renovation as a chance to return St.Mary's to a state nearer to its earlier Gothic design.|$|E

5|$|Coffin {{took the}} full range of {{architectural}} courses including studying engineering, physics, maths, mechanical drafting and freehand drawing in addition to architectural and landscape design. She also studied botany and horticulture under Charles Sprague Sargent at the Arnold Arboretum. One of her formative influences at MIT was Guy Lowell, the director of the landscape design program there, who was an <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classical values of balance, order, proportion and harmony taught by the French Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Lowell was best known for his book American Gardens, published in 1902, which influenced many landscape architects to adopt his principles to design symmetrical, axial gardens that combined architectural features with classical garden ornaments with vegetation, following the tradition of Italian villas.|$|E

He authored three books on air strategy: The Air War Plan That Defeated Hitler (1972), The Strategic Air War Against Japan (1980), and Strategic Air War Against Germany and Japan: A Memoir (1986). Hansell continued to study modern weapons systems, becoming an <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Strategic Defense Initiative and the B-2 Spirit bomber. However his main focus was in promoting technical advances in precision guided weapons to make precision bombing more practical and therefore more desirable as a military strategy.|$|E
5|$|Most {{official}} {{records show}} Davies's birth date as November 1886, {{but he is}} widely {{thought to have been}} born at least four years earlier. After leaving school aged 12 and working for some years in local pits, Davies studied mining engineering and later took an Arts degree at University College, Cardiff. He returned to the coalfields in 1913, and established a reputation for militancy. In 1918 he was elected miners' agent for the Dowlais district of the South Wales Miners' Federation (SWMF), and in 1924 was appointed SWMF's chief organiser, legal adviser, and vice-president. After a visit to Moscow in 1922 he became a firm <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, a position he maintained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Noted hadrosaur expert Jack Horner is {{currently}} the major <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idea that Tyrannosaurus was exclusively a scavenger and did not engage in active hunting at all. Horner has presented several arguments to support the pure scavenger hypothesis. The presence of large olfactory bulbs and olfactory nerves suggests a highly developed sense of smell for sniffing out carcasses over great distances. The teeth could crush bone, and therefore could extract as much food (bone marrow) as possible from carcass remnants, usually the least nutritious parts. At least some of its potential prey could move quickly, while evidence suggests that Tyrannosaurus walked instead of ran.|$|E

5|$|Originally from Ireland, Rutherford immigrated {{with his}} parents to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Colony, {{at the age of}} eighteen. In 1753 he moved to Rowan County, in the Province of North Carolina, where he married Elizabeth Graham. An active member of his community, Rutherford served in {{multiple}} civil occupations. He was a representative of both houses of the North Carolina House of Commons, as well as an unsuccessful candidate for governor. Rutherford was an <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anti-federalist movement and was appointed President of the Legislative Council of the Southwest Territory in 1794. Rutherford retired to Sumner County, Tennessee, where he died on August 10, 1805, at the age of 84.|$|E
5|$|Schwartz {{argues that}} Lincoln's American {{reputation}} grew {{slowly in the}} late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900–1920s) when he {{emerged as one of}} the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common man who they believe would have supported the welfare state. In the Cold War years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.|$|E
5|$|Beshear was {{the first}} {{candidate}} to announce his bid for the post of Attorney General of Kentucky in the 1979 election. Shortly after declaring his candidacy, he was endorsed by outgoing Attorney General Robert F. Stephens.

After winning the Democratic primary, he defeated Republican nominee Ron Snyder {{by a vote of}} 471,177 to 302,951. When incumbent Attorney General Stephens resigned in December 1979 to accept an appointment to the Kentucky Supreme Court, Beshear was appointed to fill the vacancy until his term officially began in January.

5|$|During his tenure, McCreary {{represented}} Kentucky's agricultural interests, {{introducing a}} bill to create the United States Department of Agriculture. A bill containing most of the same provisions as the one McCreary authored was passed later in the session. He also proposed a successful amendment to the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act that excluded farm implements and machinery from the tariff. An advocate of free silver, he was appointed by President Benjamin Harrison to be a delegate to the International Monetary Conference held in Brussels, Belgium, in 1892. As chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, he authored {{a bill to}} establish a court that would settle disputed land claims stemming from the Gadsden Purchase and the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. He advocated {{the creation of a}} railroad linking Canada, the United States, and Mexico. In 1890, he sponsored a bill authorizing the first Pan-American Conference and was an <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pan-American Medical Conference that met in Washington, D.C., in 1893. He authored a report declaring American hostility to European ownership of a canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and sponsored legislation authorizing the U.S. president to retaliate against foreign vessels that harassed American fishing boats.|$|E
5|$|Eager {{to promote}} and defend her religion, she {{played a leading role}} in both the Witchcraft Research Association and then the Pagan Front during the 1960s and 1970s. That latter decade also saw her briefly involve herself in far right {{politics}} as well as becoming a keen ley hunter and proponent of Earth mysteries. As well as regularly writing articles on esoteric topics for various magazines, from the 1960s onward she authored a number of books on the subject of Wicca, as well as contributing to the publication of works by Wiccan friends Stewart Farrar, Janet Farrar, and Evan John Jones. In these works also she became an early <b>advocate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idea that anyone could practice Wicca without requiring initiation by a pre-existing Wiccan, while also contributing to and encouraging research into the religion's early history. Living in Brighton during these years, she worked with both her partner and initiate Ron Cook and {{was a member of the}} Silver Malkin coven. In her final years she served as patron of the Sussex-based Centre for Pagan Studies prior to her death from pancreatic cancer.|$|E
5|$|Even out {{of elected}} office, he was widely {{considered}} the most powerful political figure in the state for many years. His influence extended {{all over the state}} and the nation.

He stayed active in Portland as well, advocating an expansion of the Park Blocks (a strip of open park space cutting through downtown Portland.) Goldschmidt assisted in the deal that led to the construction of TriMet's MAX Red Line to Portland International Airport that opened in 2001.
