40|$|The {{performance}} of the fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) using the recently described Brucella melitensis native hapten and the Brucella abortus O-polysaccharide tracer was evaluated and {{compared with those of}} The World Organization for <b>Animal</b> <b>Health</b> <b>tests</b> related to indirect and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays as classification variables for goat sera obtained from a high-prevalence area where vaccination was performed; test series were also evaluated to increase the final specificity of the tests. Our results showed that the respective relative sensitivity and specificity were 99. 7 % and 32. 5 % for the rose Bengal test with a 3 % cell concentration (RBT 3), 92. 8 % and 68. 8 % for the rose Bengal test with 8 % cell concentration (RBT 8), 98. 4 % and 84. 9 % for the Canadian complement fixation test (CFT), 83. 7 % and 65. 5 % for the Mexican CFT, 98. 4 % and 81. 0 % for the buffered plate agglutination test (BPAT), and 78. 1 % and 89. 3 % for the fluorescence polarization assay (FPA). The use of the FPA as the secondary test significantly increased the final specificities of test combinations; the screening tests BPAT, RBT 3, and RBT 8 plus FPA resulted in 90 %, 91. 2 %, and 91. 3 % final specificities, respectively, whereas for the combinations RBT 3 plus Mexican CFT, RBT 8 plus Mexican CFT, and BPAT plus Canadian CFT, the specificities were 65. 5 %, 63. 2 %, and 91. 7 %, respectively. The results suggested that the FPA may be routinely applied as an adaptable screening test for diagnosis of goat brucellosis, since its cutoff can be adjusted to improve its sensitivity or specificity, it is a rapid and simple test, it can be the test of choice when specificity is relevant or when an alternative confirmatory test is not available, and it is not affected by vaccination, thus reducing the number of goats wrongly slaughtered due to misdiagnosis...|$|E

30|$|Epidemiological field {{research}} basically provides {{two types of}} outcomes that can be communicated to farmers: 1) observational studies that provide insights into prevalence and incidence of diseases and on risk factors of farming practices that influence disease occurrence and 2) intervention studies that evaluate methods that are more economically viable or that prevent the occurrence of disease or increase livestock production parameters.

40|$|The {{present study}} adapted the HotSHOT method, a {{technique}} {{which has been}} successfully applied on different kinds of tissues, to studies of Sarcoptes. Some modifications of this technique were made which allowed the quick preparation of PCR-quality Sarcoptes genomic DNA (gDNA), namely applying sodium hydroxide as a substrate for three cycles of thermal shock, followed by a short incubation and pH adjustment with a Tris solution (HotSHOT Plus ThermalSHOCK). The performance of this technique was tested by amplifying a ~ 450 -bp rDNA fragment of the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS- 2) and by multi-locus genotyping using ten microsatellites on 520 individual Sarcoptes samples. No difference in performance was observed between gDNA samples prepared using the HotSHOT Plus ThermalSHOCK technique and those prepared using a commercial kit utilizing proteinase K digestion. The results demonstrated that the HotSHOT Plus ThermalSHOCK technique is time-saving, economic, and easily automatable for the preparation of PCR-quality mite gDNA, which has implications for studying the molecular biology of mites with human and <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> significance. Although <b>tested</b> {{in the present study}} using Sarcoptes mites as a model, this technique may find broad applicability in extraction of gDNA from other parasites with small sizes and hard bodies. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

30|$|Training in {{livestock}} health {{provision was}} reported by respondents (58.8  %) as a strategy to reduce risks associated with recurrent drought and livestock diseases. The increased number of trained, community-based <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> workers now operating in Turkana areas is an important <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> delivery channel in this marginal area (Mugunieri et al. 2004).

40|$|The {{quantity}} of research information being made {{available on the}} World Wide Web in various disciplines is increasing tremendously.

Challenges and opportunities of publishing and disseminating <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information online in Africa were also examined. Websites and online databases which offer agricultural information {{were included in the}} analysis, but the main focus was on research, education and extension information in the core areas of <b>animal</b> <b>health.</b> Content analysis method was used to determine what agricultural academic indexing and abstracting databases have in terms of quality researched <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information published from Africa or about Africa. Well-known databases, such as AGRICOLA, AGRIS, CAB Direct, PUBMED and Cochrane Library were investigated. The criteria used to determine the African <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information included the content of research <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information available on the website, {{how easy it is to}} locate information once the site has been located, the usefulness of the information, and how current and up-to-date the information is. It was found that the representation of African <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information on the web is generally low. The poor coverage of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information on the web emanates from many factors: poor ICT (Information Communications Technology) infrastructure in many African countries, lack of ICT literacy, awareness and mindset, lack of recognition of all the values of information services, poor state of African indexing and abstracting services, inadequate funds, and perceived misconceptions of actual causes of the problem. Thus, this situation has led to the web being dominated by the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information from developed countries.

40|$|The {{way that}} an {{economist}} and an <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> professional use economics differs and creates frustrations. The economist is {{in search of}} optimizing resource allocation {{in the management of}} <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> and disease problems with metrics associated with the productivity of key societal resources of labour and capital. The <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> professional have a strong belief that productivity can be improved with the removal of pathogens. These differences restrict how well economics is used in <b>animal</b> <b>health,</b> and the question posed is whether this matters. The paper explores the question by looking at the changing role of animals in society and the associated change of the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> professional's activities. It then questions if the current allocation of scarce resources for <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> are adequately allocated for societies and whether currently available data are sufficient for good allocation. A rapid review of the data on disease impacts - production losses and costs of human reaction - indicate that the data are sparse collected in different times and geographical regions. This limits what can be understood on the productivity of the economic resources used for <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> and this needs to be addressed with more systematic collection of data on disease losses and costs of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> systems. Ideally such a process should learn lessons from the way that human health has made estimates of the burden of diseases and their capture of data on the costs of human health systems. Once available data on the global burden of animal diseases and the costs of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> systems would allow assessments of individual disease management processes and the productivity of wider productivity change.

40|$|It {{is argued}} that while {{considerable}} development of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> economics has occurred in recent decades, {{it has not yet}} achieved its potential coverage. It has been mostly applied to livestock, particularly livestock used for commerce, and its application to a range of other animals has been relatively neglected. Extending its coverage also requires widening the type of objectives taken into account in the analysis. Furthermore, the main focus of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> economics has been on the economics of controlling and managing the occurrence of diseases. The economic role of genetics, the environment, nutrition and the comfort of <b>animals</b> in their <b>health</b> ought to be given greater attention.
