5|$|The {{thunderstorm}} {{that would}} eventually produce the infamous F3tornado in Fort Worth developed from a cluster of storms that formed west of the city. At 4:38p.m. CST (22:38UTC), a severe thunderstorm warning was issued on the quickly organizing storm for Parker County. <b>About</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>later,</b> another severe thunderstorm warning was issued, this time for Tarrant County, as the storm continued to track eastward. Radar imagery showed that the supercell was rapidly organizing, developing a bounded weak echo region and hook echo—radar signatures that hint at a strong and potentially tornadic thunderstorm—in less than a half-hour. Radar also indicated that a broad mesocyclone had developed by around 6:00p.m. CST (00:00 UTC), extending vertically through {{the entirety of the}} supercell. At around the same time, a wall cloud was spotted in association with the rotating thunderstorm while baseball-sized hail fell ahead of the rotation in northern Fort Worth along Interstate 820. Winds from the downdraft of another small thunderstorm south of Fort Worth allowed the strengthening supercell to organize further. At 6:10p.m. (00:10UTC), a tornado warning was issued for Tarrant County, and accordingly emergency sirens were activated in the Fort Worth a minute later.|$|E

When Unité arrived in the afternoon of 20 April 1796, the watch aboard Unité identified Inconstant as a neutral vessel and Le Breton did not clear the ship for action. <b>About</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>later,</b> Inconstant sailed alongside, boarded and captured Unité intact.|$|E

25|$|On 22 July 2011, a {{bomb went}} off in Oslo outside the {{government}} building which houses the prime minister's office, killing at least eight people while wounding others. <b>About</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>later,</b> a shooting spree, which killed 69 people, was reported at Utøya, an island forty-five minutes away where the ruling Labour Party was holding its annual youth camp.

25|$|The {{first car}} was {{reported}} to the police by an ambulance crew attending a minor incident at the nightclub when they noticed suspicious fumes. <b>About</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>later,</b> the car containing the second device was ticketed for illegal parking, and an hour after that, transported to the car pound at Park Lane, where staff noticed a strong smell of petrol and reported the vehicle to police when they heard about the first device. Both vehicles were made by Mercedes-Benz, the first a light green metallic Mercedes-Benz W124 sedan, registration number G824 VFK, and the second was L708 VBB, which was another Mercedes-Benz W124 but in blue. The cars and their devices were recovered intact for forensic examination and both were found to contain petrol cans, gas canisters and a quantity of nails, with a mobile phone-based trigger.|$|E
25|$|<b>About</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>later</b> the British {{trenches}} {{had been}} occupied and a mine gallery was discovered off a blind sap (a trench with a dead-end) with 16 British troops inside behind a barricade; the British surrendered {{once they had}} been discovered. The Germans had great difficulty consolidating their new positions, in the dark, under artillery-fire and counter-attack and in the 8th Company area, the troops formed a human chain to pass hand-grenades forward. As dawn broke the new positions had been dug down to head height but linking the new diggings to the lips of craters was done with great difficulty because the explosions had thrown {{a great deal of}} earth onto the crater edges and British troops were throwing grenades into the craters. Communication trenches were too shallow and soldiers had to crawl along them once dawn had broken and many were hit by bullets. The captured trenches had much British equipment in them which was used by the Germans to repulse counter-attacks.|$|E

25|$|After the {{breakout}} {{from the}} Pusan Perimeter in November 1950, the 8th flew daily strike missions out of Iwakuni {{and at times}} recovering at Taegu AB (K-2), which forced the crews to fly long, arduous missions that sometimes lasted more than six hours. When the Chinese Communists attacked in the Spring of 1951, FEAF requested that the light bomber wings increase their nightly sortie rate. The {{only way to do}} this was to double up some of the missions. For several months, the crews flew from Iwakuni to their patrol sectors in North Korea, completed their mission, and then flew to the K-2 Airfield. Landing a B-26 at night at Taegu was no easy feat because the Pierced Steel Planking on the runway had begun to deteriorate. The B-26s landing there tore up dozens of tires, {{and more than a few}} accidents resulted. Also, the tires were in short supply, so each one lost at K-2 was hard to replace. If the B-26 crews got down at Taegu without incident, they could find a place to grab a quick catnap as their planes were readied for the next mission. <b>About</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>later,</b> they were airborne and heading north to their next target area. Four hours later, utterly exhausted, they were back in Japan, after up to ten hours of flight and combat.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone early on June30, Bret attained maximum sustained winds of 70mph (110km/h). About six hours later, at 1200UTC, the storm also attained its minimum barometric pressure of [...] Around 2200UTC on June30, a reconnaissance aircraft flight observed hurricane-force winds, though Bret was not upgraded to a hurricane because the minimum barometric pressure was considered too high. <b>About</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>later,</b> the National Hurricane Center noted that Bret was moving westward toward Virginia at 20mph (25km/h) and entering {{a region of}} colder sea surface temperatures, causing further intensification to become unlikely. Subsequently, the storm curved west-northwestward and rapidly weakened. At 0500UTC on July1, Bret made landfall near Oyster, Virginia on the Delmarva Peninsula as a minimal tropical storm. <b>About</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>later,</b> the storm emerged into the Chesapeake Bay and weakened to a tropical depression. Later on July1, Bret moved inland over mainland Virginia and continued to weaken, until dissipating over the northern portion of the state.|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of 1011 November, the British Mediterranean Fleet {{launched}} an air raid on the harbor in Taranto. Twenty-one Swordfish torpedo bombers launched from the aircraft carrier [...] attacked the Italian fleet in two waves. The Italian base was defended by twenty-one 90mm anti-aircraft guns and dozens of smaller 37mm and 20mm guns, along with twenty-seven barrage balloons. The defenders did not possess radar, however, and so were caught by surprise when the Swordfishes arrived. Littorio and the other battleships were also not provided with sufficient anti-torpedo nets. The first wave struck at 20:35, followed by the second <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>later.</b>|$|E

Convection increased around the center and organized into a distinct eye. The JTWC upgraded the cyclone to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane at 00:00UTC on May19, estimating peak 1minute sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph). The IMD assessed a much higher intensity, estimating peak 3minute winds of 165km/h (105mph) at 03:00UTC that day. <b>About</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>later,</b> the cyclone made landfall at peak intensity with an estimated pressure of [...] in northwestern Myanmar near Sittwe, near the country's border with Bangladesh. It weakened gradually over land, dissipating over Myanmar late on May19.|$|E
500|$|Shortly before 18:00, the British destroyers [...] and [...] {{attempted}} {{to attack the}} German battlecruisers. Heavy fire from Frankfurt and Pillau forced the British ships to break off the attack. At around 18:30, Frankfurt {{and the rest of}} the II Scouting Group encountered the cruiser they opened fire and scored several hits on the ship. Rear Admiral Horace Hood's three battlecruisers intervened, however, and scored a hit on [...] that disabled the ship. <b>About</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>later,</b> Chester scored four hits on Frankfurt in quick succession: two [...] hits in the area of Frankfurts mainmast and a pair of [...] hits.

On 21 October, Trento was moved to Taranto, and she was present in the harbor on the night of 1112 November, when the British raided the port. During the attack, a single bomb hit the ship, though it failed to explode. It nevertheless damaged the forward 100mm mount on the port side.|$|E
