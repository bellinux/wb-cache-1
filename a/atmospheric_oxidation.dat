40|$|Mercury is a {{contaminant}} {{of global}} concern. It is transported {{in the atmosphere}} primarily as gaseous elemental mercury, but its reactivity and deposition to the surface environment, through which it enters the aquatic food chain, is greatly enhanced following oxidation. Measurements and modelling studies of oxidised mercury in the polar to sub-tropical marine boundary layer (MBL) have suggested that photolytically produced bromine atoms are the primary oxidant of mercury. We report year-round measurements of elemental and oxidised mercury, along with ozone, halogen oxides (IO and BrO) and nitrogen oxides (NO 2), in the MBL over the Galápagos Islands in the equatorial Pacific. Elemental mercury concentration remained low throughout the year, while higher than expected levels of oxidised mercury occurred around midday. Our {{results show that the}} production of oxidised mercury in the tropical MBL cannot be accounted for by bromine oxidation only, or by the inclusion of ozone and hydroxyl. As a two-step oxidation mechanism, where the HgBr intermediate is further oxidised to Hg(II), depends critically on the stability of HgBr, an additional oxidant is needed to react with HgBr to explain more than 50 % of the observed oxidised mercury. Based on best available thermodynamic data, we show that atomic iodine, NO 2, or HO 2 could all play the potential role of the missing oxidant, though their relative importance cannot be determined explicitly at this time due to the uncertainties associated with mercury oxidation kinetics. We conclude that the key pathway that significantly enhances <b>atmospheric</b> mercury <b>oxidation</b> and deposition to the tropical oceans is missing from the current understanding of <b>atmospheric</b> mercury <b>oxidation...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Research {{suggests}} that the implied methane destruction lifetime is as long as ~4 Earth years and as short as ~0.6 Earth years. This lifetime is short enough for the atmospheric circulation to yield the observed uneven distribution of methane across the planet.

5000|$|During springtime in {{the polar}} regions, unique {{photochemistry}} converts inert halide salt ions (e.g. Br−) into reactive halogen species (e.g. Br atoms and BrO) that episodically deplete ozone in the atmospheric boundary layer to near zero levels. Since their discovery {{in the late}} 1980s, research on these ozone depletion events (ODEs) has shown the central role ofbromine photochemistry. Due to the autocatalytic nature of the reaction mechanism, it has been called bromine explosion. It's still not fully understood how salts are transported from the ocean and oxidized to become reactive halogen species in the air. Other halogens (chlorine and iodine) are also activated through mechanisms coupled to bromine chemistry. The main consequence of halogen activation is chemical destruction of ozone, which removes the primary precursor of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxidation,</b> and generation of reactive halogen atoms/oxides that become the primary oxidizing species. The different reactivity of halogens as compared to OH and ozone has broad impacts on atmospheric chemistry, including near complete removal and deposition of mercury, alteration of oxidation fates for organic gases, and export of bromine into the free troposphere.

We report year-round measurements of elemental and oxidised mercury, along with ozone, halogen oxides (IO and BrO) and nitrogen oxides (NO 2), in the marine boundary layer over the Galápagos Islands in the Equatorial Pacific.

A two-step oxidation mechanism where the HgBr intermediate is further oxidised to Hg(II) depends critically on the stability of HgBr. If the current paradigm is considered, another oxidant is needed to explain more than 50 % of the observed oxidised mercury. We show that atomic iodine could play the role of the missing oxidant, explaining not only the Hg(II) levels observed, but also the daily variability. However, more recent theoretical calculations indicate that the thermal dissociation rate of HgBr is much faster, by an order of magnitude, than previously reported, which implies that only trace gases at relatively high mixing ratios forming stable complexes with HgBr (such as HO 2 and NO 2) could compete to generate levels of Hg(II) similar to those observed in our study. Nevertheless, the daily variability of oxidised mercury is not well accounted for by using these new theoretically estimated rates. Furthermore, correlation analysis does not support a major role of NO 2 or HO 2.
