5|$|Writing in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley {{rejected}} the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He {{argued that the}} magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain to learn from it, as well <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> suffer too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.|$|E

25|$|Dr. Cadbury {{started his}} work in Canton as a teacher in the University Medical School (part of Canton Christian College) and as a {{physician}} (an internist specifically) in the Canton Hospital. He was welcomed by the Chinese, as they viewed Canton Christians like Dr. Cadbury <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> came to help, not disturb.|$|E
25|$|Wherever {{communities}} of deaf people exist, sign languages have developed, and {{are at the}} cores of local deaf cultures. Although signing is used primarily by the deaf and hard of hearing, it is also used by hearing individuals, such <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> can hear but cannot physically speak, or have trouble with spoken language due to some other disability (augmentative and alternative communication).|$|E
25|$|Sections 41 and 42 {{establish}} Conveyancing Appeals Tribunals which hear {{complaints against}} {{decisions made by}} the Authorised Conveyancing Practitioners Board. Decisions of the Board which are appealed do not take effect until the appeal process is complete. The tribunals {{are made up of}} three members—two lay persons (classified <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are not practising legal professionals) and one legal professional.

25|$|Professor Ruut Veenhoven {{showed that}} social {{security}} payments {{do not seem to}} add to happiness. This {{may be due to the}} fact that non-self-earned income (e.g., from a lottery) does not add to happiness in general either. Happiness may be the mind's reward to a useful action. However, Johan Norberg of CIS, a free enterprise economy think tank, presents a hypothesis that <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> think that they themselves control their lives are more happy, paternalist institutions may decrease happiness.|$|E
25|$|Comedy for Peace was {{conceived}} {{and is being}} organized by Ray Hanania, a Palestinian-American stand-up comedian – {{who is married to}} a Jewish woman. It is Ray’s hope that the power of comedy combined with the power of two peoples coming together on one stage will help Palestinians and Israelis find the courage to look past the pain and the suffering of the conflict and see each other as human beings, as partners and <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have no other choice but to struggle together to achieve a lasting peace.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{had been}} paralyzed by polio matured, {{they began to}} demand the right to {{participate}} in the mainstream of society. Polio survivors were often in the forefront of the disability rights movement that emerged in the United States during the 1970s, and pushed legislation such as the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 which protected qualified individuals from discrimination based on their disability, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Other political movements led by polio survivors include the Independent Living and Universal design movements of the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E

25|$|The Rig Veda {{contains}} {{accounts of}} {{conflicts between the}} Aryas and the Dasas and Dasyus. It describes Dasas and Dasyus <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> do not perform sacrifices (akratu) or obey the commandments of gods (avrata). Their speech is described as mridhra which could variously mean soft, uncouth, hostile, scornful or abusive. Other adjectives which describe their physical appearance are subject to many interpretations. However, some modern scholars such as Asko Parpola connect the Dasas and Dasyus to Iranian tribes Dahae and Dahyu and believe that Dasas and Dasyus were early Indo-Aryan immigrants who arrived into the subcontinent before the Vedic Aryans.|$|E
25|$|The {{legacy of}} the hippie {{movement}} continues to permeate Western society. In general, unmarried couples of all ages feel free to travel and live together without societal disapproval. Frankness regarding sexual matters has become more common, {{and the rights of}} homosexual, bisexual and transsexual people, as well <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> choose not to categorize themselves at all, have expanded. Religious and cultural diversity has gained greater acceptance. Co-operative business enterprises and creative community living arrangements are more accepted than before. Some of the little hippie health food stores of the 1960s and 1970s are now large-scale, profitable businesses, due to greater interest in natural foods, herbal remedies, vitamins and other nutritional supplements. Authors Stewart Brand and John Markoff argue that the development and popularization of personal computers and the Internet find one of their primary roots in the anti-authoritarian ethos promoted by hippie culture.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{example of}} emergence in web-based systems is social bookmarking (also called collaborative tagging). In social bookmarking systems, users assign tags to resources shared with other users, which {{gives rise to}} a type of information organisation that emerges from this crowdsourcing process. Recent research which analyzes empirically the complex dynamics of such systems has shown that consensus on stable distributions and a simple form of shared vocabularies does indeed emerge, {{even in the absence of}} a central controlled vocabulary. Some believe that this could be because users who contribute tags all use the same language, and they share similar semantic structures underlying the choice of words. The convergence in social tags may therefore be interpreted as the emergence of structures <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have similar semantic interpretation collaboratively index online information, a process called semantic imitation.|$|E

25|$|The hip hop music genre and its {{subculture}} {{has been}} criticized for its gender bias and its negative impacts on women in African-American culture. Gangsta rap artists such as Eazy-E, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg have song lyrics that portray women as sex toys, and <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are inferior to and dependent on men. Between 1987 and 1993, over 400 hip hop songs had lyrics that described violence toward women including rape, assault, and murder. These anti-women hip hop lyrics have led some male listeners to make physical threats toward women and they have created negative stereotypes of young urban African-American women. Hip hop music promotes masculine hegemony and it depicts women as individuals who must rely on men. The portrayal of women in hip hop lyrics and videos tends to be violent, degrading, and highly sexualized. There is a high frequency of songs with lyrics that are demeaning, or depict sexual violence or sexual assault towards women. Videos often portray idealized female bodies and depict women as being the object of male pleasure.|$|E
25|$|When {{trustees}} fail {{in their}} main duties, the law imposes remedies {{according to the}} nature of the breach. In general, breaches of rules surrounding performance of the trust's terms can be remedied through an award of specific performance, or compensation. Breaches of the duty of care will trigger a right to compensation. Breaches of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and misapplications of property will give rise to a restitutionary claim, to restore the property taken away. In these last two situations, the courts of equity developed further principles of liability that could be applied even when a trustee had gone bankrupt. Some recipients of property that came from a breach of trust, as well <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had assisted in a breach of trust, might incur liability. Equity recognised not merely a personal, but also a proprietary claim over assets taken in breach of trust, and perhaps also profits made in breach of the duty of loyalty. A proprietary claim meant that the claimant could demand the thing in priority to other creditors of the bankrupt trustee. Alternatively, the courts would follow an asset or trace its value if the trust property was exchanged for some other asset. If trust property had been given to a third party, the trust fund could claim back the property as of right, unless the recipient was a bona fide purchaser. Generally, any recipient of trust property who knew about the breach of trust (or maybe ought to have known) could be made to give back the value, even if they had themselves exchanged the thing for other assets. Lastly, against people who may never have received trust property but had assisted in a breach of trust, and had done so dishonestly, a claim arose to return the property's value.|$|E
500|$|In August 2008, trustee W. Clarkson McDow, Jr. was {{appointed}} to manage Vick's bankruptcy. The trustee noted in court documents that Vick [...] "has limited ability to arrange his finances and limited ability {{to participate in the}} bankruptcy case on an in-person basis." [...] McDow wrote in court documents that it appeared Vick had [...] "routinely relied upon others to make financial decisions for him, giving them discretionary control over large sums of money". McDow named Mary Wong and David A. Talbot <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had obtained broad written authority to act as his attorney-in-fact over all of his financial affairs.|$|E

500|$|The {{double track}} loop through {{the station was}} {{extended}} at both ends in March 1912, with the platforms also extended. A small goods yard and coal depot was built at the north-west end of the station at the same time. A signal box {{was built on the}} southern platform {{at the end of the}} First World War. By 1929, services had increased to 21 trains per day on weekdays and eight per day on Sundays. This allowed a train every half-hour, with one train per hour running to Bristol Temple Meads and the other terminating at [...] Passenger traffic was mainly commuters, to both Bristol and Portishead, as well <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> wished to use the Pill ferry across the river to Shirehampton. During the Second World War, many evacuees from Bristol commutered into the city from Pill. The station staff at this time consisted of a station master, two porters and two female signallers.|$|E
500|$|Outliers has two parts: [...] "Part One: Opportunity" [...] {{contains}} five chapters, and [...] "Part Two: Legacy" [...] has four. The {{book also}} contains an Introduction and Epilogue. Focusing on outliers, defined by Gladwell <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{do not fit}} into our normal understanding of achievement, Outliers deals with exceptional people, especially those who are smart, rich, and successful, and those who operate at the extreme outer edge of what is statistically plausible. The book offers examples that include the musical ensemble The Beatles, Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates, and the theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. In the introduction, Gladwell lays out the purpose of Outliers: [...] "It's not enough to ask what successful people are like. [...] It is only by asking where they are from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't." [...] Throughout the publication, he discusses how family, culture, and friendship each {{play a role in}} an individual's success, and he constantly asks whether successful people deserve the praise that we give them.|$|E
