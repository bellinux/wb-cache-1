5|$|A {{new game}} {{mechanic}} {{to the series}} {{is the use of}} a slate found on all the Ages. These slates can be carved using the mouse to create shapes and symbols. The use of the slate is necessary to communicate with a shadowy race of creatures known as the Bahro. The Bahro understand certain symbols drawn on the slate and will respond to them; the creatures also retrieve the slate <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to its original space if the player drops it. Slate symbols can cause environmental changes such as rain or increased wind, which may be necessary for solving puzzles. The slate cannot be carried everywhere due to its size. For example, the player will have to leave the slate behind if they want to climb a ladder.|$|E

5|$|Adventure is a {{video game}} for the Atari 2600 video game console, {{released}} in late –. In the game, the player controls a square avatar whose quest is to explore an open-ended environment to find a magical chalice <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to the golden castle. The game world is populated by roaming enemies: three dragons that can eat the avatar and a bat that randomly steals and hides items around the game world. Adventure introduced a number of innovative game elements to console games, including a playing area that spanned several different screens and enemies that continued to move even when not displayed on the screen.|$|E
5|$|Five police officers, {{who volunteered}} {{to carry out the}} execution, were each paid $300. The {{shooters}} used identical Winchester Model 94 rifles. One prison official selected each rifle at random from a table and handed them to another prison official sitting in a small room, out of sight. The second prison official would then load the rifle, <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to the table. Four of the rifles were loaded with live ammunition. One was secretly loaded with a wax bullet so that none of the officers would be certain that they fired a deadly shot. The non-lethal cartridge was tested to ensure that the report and recoil was difficult to distinguish from a real cartridge.|$|E

He sneaks into the morgue where Valmont's {{body has been}} cremated, {{collects}} the eleven emeralds from his ashes and escapes. The police discover that Diabolik is still alive and offer a million-dollar reward for him. He reacts by blowing up the tax offices. Without tax revenue, {{the country is in}} debt and sells off some gold to buy currency. Twenty tons of gold is melted into one solid block to make it difficult to steal, and the block is loaded on a train. Diabolik and Eva divert the train by leaving a burning truck on the tracks and re-route it to a bridge where a bomb is placed. It explodes when the train arrives and the gold falls into the water below. Diabolik and Eva collect it <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to their hideout.|$|E

5|$|The classic {{types are}} the deathmatch (and its team-based variant) in which players score points by killing other players' characters; and capture the flag, in which teams attempt to {{penetrate}} the opposing base, capture a flag <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to their own base whilst preventing the other team from doing the same. Other game modes may involve attempting to capture enemy bases or areas of the map, attempting to take hold of an object {{for as long as}} possible while evading other players, or deathmatch variations involving limited lives or in which players fight over a particularly potent power-up. These match types may also be customizable, allowing the players to vary weapons, health and power-ups found on the map, as well as victory criteria. Games may allow players to choose between various classes, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, equipment and roles within a team.|$|E
5|$|The game, {{which was}} the sixth edition of the bowl, was {{expected}} to be an offensive shootout. Boise State averaged 42.4points during the 2007 season, while East Carolina averaged 31. That expectation turned out to be justified as East Carolina took a 31–14 lead in the first half. The Broncos fought back in the second half, however, tying the score at 38 late in the fourth quarter after East Carolina's Chris Johnson fumbled the ball, allowing Bronco defender Marty Tadman to recover the ball <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> 47yards for a touchdown. The game remained tied until the final moments as East Carolina's Ben Hartman made a 34–yard game-winning field goal as time expired. The attendance of 30,467 was the largest crowd to attend a Hawaii Bowl game that did not feature the host school. Boise State's loss dropped them to a final 2007 record of 10–3, while East Carolina's final-game win earned them a record of 8–5.|$|E

5|$|By the Battle of Chaffin's Farm on September 29, 1864, Beaty {{had risen}} {{to the rank of}} first {{sergeant}} in Company G. His regiment was among a division of black troops assigned to attack the center of the Confederate defenses at New Market Heights. The defenses consisted of two lines of abatis and one line of palisades manned by Brigadier General John Gregg's Texas Brigade. The attack was met with intense Confederate fire and was turned back after reaching a line of abatis. During the retreat, Company G's color bearer was killed; Beaty returned through about 600 yards of enemy fire to retrieve the flag <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to the company lines. The regiment had suffered severe casualties in the failed charge. Of Company G's eight officers and eighty-three enlisted men who entered the battle, only sixteen enlisted men, including Beaty, survived the attack unwounded. With no officers remaining, Beaty took command of the company and led it through a second charge at the Confederate lines. The second attack successfully drove the Confederates from their fortified positions, at the cost of three more men from Company G. By the end of the battle, over fifty percent of the black division had been killed, captured, or wounded. For his actions, Beaty was commended on the battlefield by General Benjamin Butler and seven months later, on April 6, 1865, awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|For {{his second}} season, Munnerlyn {{moved up to}} {{starting}} right cornerback after Richard Marshall was not re-signed. In Week 3 against the Cincinnati Bengals, he snagged his first career interception against Carson Palmer. In his first {{start of the season}} in Week 12 against the Cleveland Browns, Munnerlyn stepped in front of a pass from Jake Delhomme intended for Mohamed Massaquoi to pick it off <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> 37 yards for the touchdown. He went on to start five of the last six games of the season for the Panthers. Playing in 16 games with five starts, Munnerlyn recorded 47 tackles and one forced fumble, tied for second on the team with three interceptions (including one returned for a touchdown) and ranked first with 10 passes defensed, contributing to a Panthers defense that ranked seventh in the NFL in average yards per play. He also led the Panthers with a 10.9-yard punt return average on 30 returns for 327 yards with a long of 37 yards and returned two kickoffs for 87 yards.|$|E
5|$|In Adventure, the player's goal is {{to recover}} the Enchanted Chalice that an evil magician has stolen and hidden in the kingdom <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to the Golden Castle. The kingdom {{includes}} two other castles (White and Black) and various obstacles and mazes within them. Further, the kingdom is guarded by three dragons: Yorgle (yellow dragon), Grundle (green dragon), and Rhindle (red dragon who moves much faster than the other two), that protect various items {{in the game and}} will try to chase and eat the player's avatar. There is also a bat that can roam across the kingdom freely, carrying a single item (which can include the player's avatar or a dragon) around; the bat was to be named Knubberrub but the name did not make it into the manual. The bat has two states, agitated and non-agitated; when in the agitated state, the bat will either pick up or swap what it currently carries with an object in the present room, eventually returning to the non-agitated state where it will not pick up an object. The bat continues to fly around even if not present on the player's current screen and may continue moving or swapping around objects.|$|E

5|$|In the present, former Imperial knight Yuri Lowell goes on {{a mission}} to {{retrieve}} his neighborhood's blastia core from a nobleman when their reservoir fails. While on his mission, he encounters a noble woman called Estelle, and flees with her from the capital in pursuit of the blastia thief. On their journey, they also meet Karol, a trainee hunter separated from his guild; a blastia researcher named Rita; Raven, a Great War veteran; Judith, a Krytia who seeks to destroy the blastia harming the aer balance; and exclusive to the PS3 version only, seemingly the descender of a legendary pirate Aifread named Patty Fleur. Together, the group recover the stolen core from a corrupt guild leader <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to Yuri's friend and former fellow knight Flynn. Yuri and Karol then decide to form an independent guild called Brave Vesperia. Shortly after this, Estelle is attacked by an Entelexeia called Phaeroh, who accuses her of poisoning the planet. After investigating and meeting a second time with Phaeroh, Brave Vesperia learn that Estelle is a Child of the Full Moon, capable of converting aer into magic without the aid of a blastia core, and that her actions are causing the aer krene, the sources of aer, to overproduce aer with deadly results. Alongside these events, Yuri sees that the Imperial authorities are powerless to act against powerful figures involved in blastia abuse: he takes matters into his own hands and murders two officials connected to the abuses. These acts put a strain on his friendship with Flynn.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{youngest}} Concordes (F-BTSD) is on display at Le Bourget Air and Space Museum in Paris. In February 2010, {{it was announced that}} the museum and a group of volunteer Air France technicians intend to restore F-BTSD so it can taxi under its own power. In May 2010, it was reported that the British Save Concorde Group and French Olympus 593 groups had begun inspecting the engines of a Concorde at the French museum; their intent is to restore the airliner to a condition where it can fly in demonstrations. Save Concorde Group hoped to get F-BTSD flying for the 2012 London Olympics, but this never happened. The work for restoring F-BTSD to operating condition as of September 2015 is currently not very well known, and it is still being housed in Le Bourget as a museum exhibit. In 2015, the organisation Club Concorde announced that it had raised funds of £120million for a static display and to buy the Concorde at Le Bourget, restore it <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to service as a heritage aircraft for air displays and charter hire by 2019, to coincide with the 50thanniversary of Concorde's first flight.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo 64 version {{features}} two game types: Deathmatch or Team Deathmatch, {{where the}} objective is to kill as many opposing players as possible; and Frag Tag, in which one random player is transformed into a monkey with no attacks and very little health. The monkey's task is to go to a specific point to return to their normal form and transform another random player into the monkey. Players gain points by killing the monkey and lose points if they die as the monkey. The Microsoft Windows version features three game types: Rok Match, which is the same as Deathmatch; Arena, where two players or teams must battle against each other in an arena setting. The winning player or team will have to face a new opponent. If the player or team loses, they will have to get in line and wait for their next turn to fight again; and Capture the Flag, where the goal is to capture opposing flags <b>and</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to a team's base.|$|E
