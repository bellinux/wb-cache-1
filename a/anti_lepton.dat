40|$|In R-parity violating {{supersymmetry}} a gaugino can {{be produced}} at HERA by the t-channel exchange of a selectron between the beam positron or electron and an initial quark from the beam proton. In the generic MSSM model the gaugino can decay in a cascade into two quarks and an (<b>anti)</b> <b>lepton.</b> For this model a search in the e^{+-}-channel has been performed with the ZEUS detector using combined e^{+-}p-data of L_{int}= 121 pb^{- 1 }. No deviations from the Standard Model have been observed and exclusion limits on parameters of the MSSM have been set. Assuming the GMSB model with the gravitino as lightest supersymmetric particle and the neutralino as next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle, the neutralino decays into a gravitino and a high-energy photon. For this model searches have been performed with the H 1 detector using e^+p-data of L_{int}= 64. 3 pb^{- 1 } and e^-p-data of L_{int}= 13. 5 pb^{- 1 } and with the ZEUS detector using e^+p-data of L_{int}= 65. 1 pb^{- 1 }. No deviations from the Standard Model have been observed and limits on the selectron and neutralino masses have been set. Additionally, limits on the R-parity violating Yukawa coupling have been derived in the search performed with the H 1 detector.

40|$|The present thesis {{describes}} two experiments {{performed in}} the storage ring CELSIUS at The Svedberg Laboratory in Uppsala. In the first experiment the importance of three - nucleon clustering in the six - nucelon system was investigated. The total cross section {{for the production of}} the ground state and the 3. 56 MeV second excited state of 6 Li in the 3 He(3 He, 6 Li) π+ reaction has been measured at two beam energies, 261. 1 and 262. 5 MeV, corresponding to center - of - mass energies 1. 2 and 1. 9 MeV above the production threshold for the 3. 56 MeV state. For the ground state the result was 347  ± 84 ± 42 and 92  ± 84  ± 11 nb respectively. The result for the 3. 56 MeV state, 104  ± 23  ± 12 and 56  ± 35  ± 7 nb respectively, is compared to the result of a previous study where the 3. 56 MeV state was populated in the d(4 He, 6 Li) π 0 reaction. In the second experiment a clean sample of 5 × 105 eta mesons was prepared by means of the d(p, 3 He) η reaction. Eta production was tagged by the precise determination of the kinetic energy of the associated 3 He ions. In the subsequent decay of eta mesons, channels with <b>lepton</b> - <b>anti</b> - <b>lepton</b> pairs were studied in the WASA detector. In a separate study properties of the WASA deuterium pellet target were investigated and in particular the effects on the beam of the beam - target interactions. In both sets of experiments the fused nuclear system was detected by means of a zero - degree spectrometer with a semiconductor detector telescope. Choosing the detectors to match the rather different requirements, precise information regarding the identity and the momentum of the detected ions could be obtained in both cases...|$|R
