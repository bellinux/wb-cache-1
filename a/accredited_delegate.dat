50|$|First Meeting In 1902, the National-American Woman Suffrage Association invited all National woman {{suffrage}} organizations which {{existed at}} that date, {{to send an}} <b>accredited</b> <b>delegate</b> to attend a mass meeting which should be held in Washington, D. C., to consider the feasibility of organizing an International Woman Suffrage Association. This meeting was held in February of that year and six national associations were represented, namely: Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Norway, Sweden and the United States. Australia had no national association, but sent a delegate, several of the U.S. state societies contributing to a fund which was raised to assist her in paying the expenses of the long and costly journey from Melbourne to Washington. Where no suffrage associations had as yet been formed, National Councils of Women and American Consulates were consulted, {{in the effort to}} find representative women who sympathized with the movement for the enfranchisement of women. As a result of such correspondence, one delegate each was present from Chili, Russia and Turkey; and many reports upon the civil, educational and industrial status of women, were secured. Some of these possess much historical value. All such reports, in abridged form, together with the transactions, were printed and preserved.|$|E

50|$|The JOOI International Convention is {{an annual}} {{international}} gathering of JOOI members {{that takes place}} at the beginning of July. The International Convention is composed of several activities throughout its four-day span: workshops, business sessions, service projects, and recreational activities. Various workshops take place that teach members how to become great leaders in their communities and are led by guest speakers as well as members from the JOOI Board of Directors. While topics range from communication skills to life lessons, all of these workshops allow members to learn more about themselves and motivate them to be the best that they can. The business sessions that take place are where members learn about the current issues within the organization. During specific sessions, <b>accredited</b> <b>delegates</b> representing their clubs vote for any changes within the Policy for Governance of JOOI.|$|R

Only one African-American sat in the audience and only one or two eastern intellectuals. The convention was called by the Conference for Progressive Political Action, and duly <b>accredited</b> <b>delegates</b> appeared for such organizations as: the Food Reform Society of America, the National Unity Committee, and the Davenport Iowa Ethical Society. Many students attended, one of the largest groups coming from Columbia University. Jacob Coxey was present as well as John J. Streeter.

5000|$|In December 1867, O'Neill became {{president}} of the Roberts faction of the Fenian Brotherhood, which in the following year held a great convention in Philadelphia attended by over 400 properly <b>accredited</b> <b>delegates,</b> while 6,000 Fenian soldiers, armed and in uniform, paraded the streets. At this convention a second invasion of Canada was conceived. The news of the Clerkenwell explosion was a strong incentive to a vigorous policy. Henri Le Caron, who, while acting as a secret agent of the British government, held the position of [...] "Inspector-General of the Irish Republican Army," [...] asserts that he distributed fifteen thousand stands of arms and almost three million rounds of ammunition in the care of the many trusted men stationed between Ogdensburg, New York and St. Albans, Vermont, in preparation for the intended raid. It took place in April 1870, and proved a failure just as rapid and complete as the attempt of 1866. The Fenians under O'Neill's command crossed the Canadian frontier near Franklin, Vermont, but were dispersed by a single volley from Canadian volunteers. O'Neill himself was promptly arrested by the United States authorities acting under the orders of President Ulysses S. Grant.|$|R
5000|$|Out of the Committee of Forty-Eight, some earlier {{organizations}} {{formed by}} La Follette, and the Chicago conventions grew the Conference for Progressive Political Action. La Follette had told reporters {{the previous summer}} {{that there would be}} no need for a third ticket unless both parties nominated reactionaries. Then came the Doheny scandals. As it seemed likely at the time that the scandals would eliminate Democratic frontrunner William Gibbs McAdoo, who was popular among railroad unions and other labor groups, the way was paved for the party which was launched at Cleveland in July 1924. Twelve hundred delegates and nine thousand spectators ratified the nomination of La Follette. The atmosphere was more sober than the one that had prevailed in 1912, where Theodore Roosevelt elicited much enthusiasm among the delegations. Farmers themselves were sparsely represented; they were too [...] "broke" [...] to come, according to Senator Lynn Frazier. Only one African-American sat in the audience and only one or two eastern intellectuals. Duly <b>accredited</b> <b>delegates</b> appeared for the Food Reform Society of America, the National Unity Committee, and the Davenport Iowa Ethical Society. Many students attended, one of the largest groups coming from Columbia University. Jacob Coxey was present as well as John J. Streeter. Radical labor leaders constituted the main body of the congregation. It was the dream of the Progressives that they might replace the Democrats, and thereby bring a clearer ideological alignment to American politics. The best way to do this, according to John Hopkins, would be to prevent either of the major parties from gaining a majority in the Electoral College and thus force the House of Representatives to choose the President.|$|R
50|$|During the Second Dáil the Irish Republic and the British Government of David Lloyd George {{agreed to}} hold peace negotiations. As President of Dáil Éireann (Priomh Aire, or {{literally}} First Minister) Éamon de Valera {{was the highest}} official in the Republic at this time but was notionally only the head of government. In August 1921, to strengthen his side's hand in the negotiations, he had the Second Dáil amend the Republic's brief Dáil Constitution to grant him the title President of the Republic, and thereby became head of state. The purpose of this change was to impress upon the British the Republican doctrine that the negotiations were between two sovereign states with <b>delegates</b> <b>accredited</b> by their respective heads of state: the British king and the Irish president.|$|R
5000|$|... "Despite the {{difficulties}} of travel {{and the fact that}} only three months' notice had been given the gathering at Geneva was more widely representative than any previous meeting. Women were present from thirty-six countries. Of the twenty-six affiliated with the Alliance {{at the time of the}} last meeting, in 1913, the auxiliaries of nineteen showed their continued vitality by sending fully <b>accredited</b> <b>delegates</b> to Geneva. Representatives were also present from the former auxiliaries in Austria and Germany, who were accorded full membership rights. The Russian national president, a fugitive from her country, was unable to come but sent her greetings. The Belgian society abstained from taking part and from the Polish and Portuguese auxiliaries no answer was received.Four countries, Greece, Spain, Argentina and Uruguay, sent delegates from newly formed National Suffrage Societies, which were accepted in the Alliance. In addition there were present women from Armenia, the Crimea, Lettonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Poland, Turkey and the Ukraine. For the first time women from India and Japan came to tell of the beginnings of the organized movement among the women of the East. It was only {{the difficulties}} of travel which prevented the delegates who had started on their journeys from China, Egypt and Palestine from arriving in time for the congress. For the first time more than half the voting delegates represented countries in which women had the full suffrage. The consequent increased political importance of the congress was recognized by the governments of the world, of which eighteen in Europe appointed official representatives, and the United States of America and Uruguay of South America. The Secretariat of the League of Nations also sent a representative.The outstanding feature of the first business session was the announcement of particulars by representatives of the many nations which had given the political and suffrage eligibility to women between 1913 and 1920—Austria, British East Africa, Canada, Crimea, Czecho-Slovakia, Denmark, Esthonia, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Iceland, Lettonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Rhodesia, Russia, Sweden, the Ukraine and six more of the United States. It was announced that women sit as members of Parliament in the majority of these countries, while large numbers are members of municipal councils. In the United States of America the Federal Suffrage Amendment had passed both Houses of Congress and had been ratified by thirty-five of the necessary thirty-six States. Serbia, Belgium and Roumania had granted Municipal suffrage to women and the Zionists of Palestine and the Commune of Fiume had given to them full equal suffrage and eligibility. ... It was decided to arrange at the next congress a session at which only enfranchised women should speak[...] [...] [...] The Catholic Woman Suffrage Society of Great Britain was accepted as a member of the Alliance. On Monday, a special feature was the speeches of five women members of Parliament—Helen Ring Robinson (State Senate), Colorado; Elna Munch, Denmark; Annie Furuhjelm, Finland; [...] Lady Astor, Great Britain; Tekla Kauffman, Wurtemberg. In all, nine women members of Parliament attended the Congress. The others, who spoke at later meetings, were Frau Burian and Adelheid Popp of Austria; Mme. Petkavetchaite of Lithuania and Adele Schrieber-Krieger, whose election to the German Reichstag was announced during the Congress. On Wednesday at the great meeting in the Hall of the Reformation, three-minute speeches were given by representatives of each of the enfranchised countries in the Alliance. Yet another new aspect was illustrated by the meeting of Thursday, addressed by women from India and China. The speeches showed how similar are the difficulaies of the women of both the East and the West and how much new ground has still to be broken before the object of the Alliance is achieved." ...|$|R
