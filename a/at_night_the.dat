5|$|As {{with other}} {{downtown}} buildings, the tower's setbacks and spires are accented by colored lights <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> <b>The</b> building's managers were praised for dimming their lights during bird migrations, reducing bird mortality 80%.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>night,</b> <b>the</b> green-skinned Billy {{takes his}} revenge {{out on the}} two police deputies for {{interrogating}} him about Dr. Mellon's death and kills both of them at a gas station. The next day, Kathy puts the pendant on Billy's chest while they are laying together outside. Billy immediately wakes up with green skin and deformed teeth and attacks Kathy, but she escapes. Law enforcement officials shoot at Billy from an aircraft, but Billy destroys the aircraft with the cannon, and later kills Chuck and Froggy by blowing up their car.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>night,</b> <b>the</b> land cools {{off more}} quickly than the ocean because of {{differences}} in their specific heat values. This temperature change causes the daytime sea breeze to dissipate. When the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be {{lower than that of}} the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an onshore wind is not strong enough to oppose it.|$|E

5|$|Cheetahs are diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day), whereas the leopards, tigers, and lions are nocturnal (active mainly at night); diurnality allows better {{observation}} and {{monitoring of the}} animal. Hunting is the major activity throughout the day; peaks are observed during dawn and dusk indicating crepuscular tendencies. Groups rest in grassy clearings after dusk, though males and juveniles often roam around <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> <b>The</b> cheetah is an alert animal; individuals often inspect their vicinity at observation points such as elevations. Even while resting, they take turns at keeping a lookout.|$|E
5|$|Clouds {{intercept}} both {{heat from}} the sun and heat radiated from the Earth. Their effects are complex and vary in time, location, and altitude. Usually during the daytime the interception of sunlight predominates, giving a cooling effect; however, <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>the</b> re-radiation of heat to the Earth slows the Earth's heat loss, this causes storms and subsequent flood rains and flooding.|$|E
5|$|In the winter, melting snow seeps into {{cracks and}} joints and freezes <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> <b>The</b> {{force of the}} {{expanding}} ice helps to erode the rock of the Claron Formation. Over 200 of these freeze/thaw cycles occur each year in Bryce Canyon. Frost wedging exploits and widens the nearly vertical joint planes that divide the Pink Member of the Claron Formation.|$|E

5|$|Late <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>the</b> Royalist generals reached York, {{with many}} routed troops and stragglers. The Governor of York, Sir Thomas Glemham, allowed {{only those who}} were part of the {{garrison}} (in effect, only a few officers who had participated in the battle as volunteers) into the city, in case Parliamentarian cavalry entered the city {{on the heels of the}} fleeing Royalists. Many fugitives, including wounded, crowded the streets before Micklegate Bar, the western gate into the city.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{was held}} on 13–14 June, with two two-hour {{sessions}} each night; one run at dusk, the other in darkness.

5|$|Sandakan has a {{tropical}} rainforest climate under the Köppen climate classification.

5|$|The {{advent of}} steel frame {{structural}} systems allowed completely vertical construction; {{but as with}} many skyscrapers of the era, the exterior was designed with multiple setbacks at increasing heights, which served to allow additional light into the ever-deepening concrete valleys in urban cores. <b>At</b> <b>night,</b> <b>the</b> setbacks are upwardly lit by floodlights, further emphasizing the structure's vertical elements. The night illumination design was a common contemporary Chicago architectural theme, seen also in the Wrigley Building, the Jewelers Building, the Palmolive Building, the LaSalle-Wacker Building, and the Tribune Tower.|$|E
5|$|The mildest form of hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{is difficult to}} detect clinically, but may be demonstrated on neuropsychological testing. It is experienced as forgetfulness, mild confusion, and irritability. The first stage of {{hepatic encephalopathy}} is characterised by an inverted sleep-wake pattern (sleeping by day, being awake <b>at</b> <b>night).</b> <b>The</b> second stage is marked by lethargy and personality changes. The third stage is marked by worsened confusion. The fourth stage {{is marked by a}} progression to coma.|$|E
5|$|The oribi is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day), though some {{activity}} {{may also be}} observed <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> <b>The</b> animal rests in cover during rain events. Unlike all other small antelopes, oribi can exhibit three types of mating systems, depending on the habitat – polyandry, polygyny and polygynandry; polygyny tends to prevail as the female-to-male ratio increases. A study suggested that polygyny is preferred in areas of high predator risk, as it leads to formation of groups as an anti-predator measure. Small herds of up to four members are also common.|$|E

5|$|The tower {{had four}} lifts, each capable of {{reaching}} the top in 90 seconds and conveying up to 2000 people an hour. The views from the top included the Liverpool skyline, the River Mersey estuary and the River Dee. On a clear day visitors could see across the Irish Sea to the Isle of Man, along with views of the Lake District and Welsh Mountains. In its first year the tower attracted up to half a million visitors to the top. <b>At</b> <b>night</b> <b>the</b> tower was illuminated by fairy lights.|$|E
5|$|The turtle starts its day at sunrise, {{emerging}} from the water to bask for several hours. Warmed for activity, it returns to the water to forage. After becoming chilled, the turtle re-emerges for one to two more cycles of basking and feeding. <b>At</b> <b>night,</b> <b>the</b> turtle drops {{to the bottom of}} its water body or perches on an underwater object and sleeps.|$|E
5|$|Transformation {{into human}} form {{is said to}} be rare, and usually occurs <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> <b>The</b> encantado will often be seen running from a festa, despite protests from the others for it to stay, and can be seen by pursuers as it hurries to the river and reverts to dolphin form. When it is under human form, it wears a hat to hide its blowhole, which does not {{disappear}} with the shapeshift.|$|E

5|$|Typically nocturnal (active <b>at</b> <b>night),</b> <b>the</b> royal {{antelope}} exhibits remarkable alertness. Territories {{are marked}} with dung. A herbivore, the royal antelope prefers small quantities of fresh foliage and shoots; fruits and fungi {{may be taken}} occasionally. Like other neotragines, the royal antelope is monogamous.

5|$|When Litwak's Family Fun Center & Arcade closes <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>the</b> various {{video game}} {{characters}} leave their normal in-game roles and {{are free to}} travel to other games. Wreck-It Ralph, the antagonist of the game Fix-It Felix Jr., is ostracized by his game's characters for just doing his job, while the titular hero Felix is praised. Tired of being mistreated, Ralph announces at the game's thirtieth anniversary party that he will earn his neighbors' respect by winning a medal.|$|E
5|$|After {{ownership}} of the Meridian Main Street {{was transferred to the}} Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007, the two organizations, along with the Meridian Downtown Association, spearheaded the downtown revitalization effort. The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization, allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing, and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations. Plans were underway to renovate the Threefoot Building, but newly elected Mayor Cheri Barry killed the plans in early 2010. Today, the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops, restaurants, and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> <b>The</b> Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events, and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown.|$|E
