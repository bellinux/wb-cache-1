5|$|The Prison Gallery showcases {{and offers}} for sale the artworks {{of current and}} ex-prisoners of Western Australia. It also hosts other {{exhibits}} related {{to the history of}} the prison, including historical artefacts. Many cells and areas of the prison depict prisoners' artwork, including that of the 19th-century forger James Walsh, whose artwork was hidden beneath layers of white-wash for decades. Painting or drawing on walls was originally forbidden, though graffiti, which could be viewed as art or vandalism, occurred throughout the prison's operational years. This rule was relaxed in special cases – including, from 1976, long-term prisoners within their own cells – but only for work considered art and not graffiti. Art, or <b>art</b> <b>therapy,</b> was not officially permitted until the 1980s; graffiti was never formally permitted, but in the prison's last six months, with closure imminent, the rule was not enforced.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The overall {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to develop a culturally sensitive <b>arts</b> <b>therapies</b> programme for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in primary schools in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). This research adapted the UK <b>arts</b> <b>therapies</b> practice to fit these cultural requirements. Design/methodology – The study is a mixed methods design, carried out in two stages. The first stage was to identify the current provision and cultural issues in conducting <b>arts</b> <b>therapies</b> intervention for children with ADHD in KSA. Data was collected using interviews from twelve arts therapists from the UK and nine informants from KSA. The information obtained assisted in the development of culturally sensitive guidelines for the delivery of an <b>arts</b> <b>therapies</b> programme, which was conducted in stage two of the study. The second stage involved a pilot randomised control trial design that took place in an identified school in KSA. This stage involved 12 children aged 6 - 12, randomly allocated to either the intervention or the control group, with six participants in each group. The programme was carried out three times a week over a period of eight weeks. Data was collected using pre and post-tests (SDQ and ADHD scales) and from interviews of the parents and teachers of the children from both the experimental and control groups. Findings – The findings demonstrate that art therapists in KSA focus on behaviour modification while arts therapists in the UK focus on improving emotional wellbeing. Art therapists in KSA used more structured approaches which are less effective for children with ADHD. There may be cultural problems in using <b>arts</b> <b>therapies</b> in KSA, particularly music and dance. Safety, routine activities and ground rules were adopted from the current practices in the UK and adapted to be appropriate for the cultural context in KSA. A culturally sensitive <b>arts</b> <b>therapies</b> programme may be an appropriate and valuable intervention for children with ADHD. Qualitative and quantitative findings indicate that the intervention of this study achieved specific benefits such as; decreasing hyperactivity/ impulsiveness and inattention. Moreover, this intervention improves relationship/social skills and emotional wellbeing. Practical implications – This programme is found to be beneficial and it may {{have a significant impact on}} the treatment of ADHD in KSA. Understanding cultural issues by the therapist increases the value of <b>arts</b> <b>therapies</b> interventions. Value – This study has many benefits as a contribution to knowledge and for the development of services in KSA for this client population. Since children with ADHD currently have minimal access to therapy of any sort, and very limited access to <b>arts</b> <b>therapies,</b> this research has a key role in developing culturally sensitive <b>arts</b> <b>therapies</b> programme for children with ADHD...|$|R
40|$|<b>Arts</b> <b>therapies</b> and Schema Focused therapy (SFT), use experiential {{techniques}} to help patients access and reprocess emotions. We conducted a randomized controlled pilot {{study to determine}} {{the effectiveness of these}} therapies at evoking emotional states ("schema modes") in forensic patients, a group that is considered difficult to reach emotionally. Ten male forensic patients with Cluster B personality disorders who were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of SFT versus usual forensic treatment ("treatment as usual," TAU) participated in the study. We investigated the effect of <b>Arts</b> <b>therapies</b> versus verbal psychotherapy, and SET versus TAU on modes. As hypothesized, patients showed significantly more healthier emotional states in their <b>Arts</b> <b>therapy</b> sessions than in their verbal psychotherapy sessions SFT evoked more childmodes than TAU, at a trend level of significance. Patients in the SF-T and TAU conditions showed no differences in schema modes early in therapy, and were equivalent on all baseline characteristics. These findings, though requiring replication in a larger sample, suggest that <b>Arts</b> <b>therapies</b> and SET have potential for evoking emotional states in difficult to reach patients.
