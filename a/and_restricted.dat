5|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, <b>and</b> <b>restricted</b> and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice {{signs in the}} first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.|$|E
5|$|In December 1939, Centaur {{underwent}} a minor refit in Hong Kong, with a supercharger {{and a new}} propeller fitted to the engine. The supercharger broke down in April 1942, {{and could not be}} repaired because of equipment shortages <b>and</b> <b>restricted</b> dockyard access caused by World War II.|$|E
5|$|Many unique environments {{were created}} by the {{migrating}} Sevier thrust system, and the {{four members of the}} Carmel Formation in southwest Utah capture these changing environments. Both open marine (crinoids) <b>and</b> <b>restricted</b> marine (pelecypods, gastropods) environments are represented in the Co-op Creek member. Sandstone and gypsum in the Crystal Creek and Paria River members signal a return to desert conditions in a coastal setting.|$|E

5|$|Most {{pterosaur}} skulls had elongated jaws with a {{full complement}} of needle-like teeth. In some cases, fossilized keratinous beak tissue has been preserved, though in toothed forms, the beak is small <b>and</b> <b>restricted</b> to the jaw tips and does not involve the teeth. Some advanced beaked forms were toothless, such as the pteranodonts and azhdarchids, and had larger, more extensive, and more bird-like beaks.|$|E
5|$|The {{biogeography}} {{demonstrates a}} phylogenetic association, for instance subgenus Hermione having a lowland distribution, but subgenus Narcissus section Apodanthi being montane <b>and</b> <b>restricted</b> to Morocco, Spain and Portugal. The remaining sections within subgenus Narcissus include both lowland and mountain habitats. Section Pseudonarcissus, although widely naturalised is endemic to the Baetic Ranges {{of the south}} eastern Iberian peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The red-winged fairywren is a {{cooperative}} breeding species, {{with a pair}} or small group of birds maintaining and defending a territory year-round. These territories average around 0.4–2.4hectares (1–6acres) in optimal habitat of tall karri forest, although are smaller <b>and</b> <b>restricted</b> to dense riverbank undergrowth in less favourable habitats.|$|E

5|$|The war of 1918 led to {{disintegration}} within both socialist and the non-socialist factions. The power political {{shift toward}} the right caused a dispute between conservatives and liberals {{on the best}} system of government for Finland to adopt: the former demanded monarchy <b>and</b> <b>restricted</b> parliamentarianism, the latter demanded a Finnish republic with full-scale democracy and social reforms. Both sides justified their views via political and legal grounds.|$|E
5|$|Trapping resumed in the U.S. after 1962 once numbers had {{recovered}} sufficiently. During the early 1970s, {{the value of}} fisher pelts soared, leading to another population crash in 1976. After {{a couple of years}} of closed seasons, fisher trapping re-opened in 1979 with a shortened season <b>and</b> <b>restricted</b> bag limits. The population has steadily increased since then, with steadily increasing numbers of trapped animals, despite a much lower pelt value.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed {{as studies have shown}} that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of phosphite into the stem of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is costly to administer <b>and</b> <b>restricted</b> to known plants.|$|E
5|$|As a {{pervasive}} developmental disorder, Asperger syndrome is distinguished by {{a pattern of}} symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped <b>and</b> <b>restricted</b> patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E
5|$|As mentioned, the British Railways batch had detail {{differences}} to previous versions. The most significant modification was {{the reduction of}} weight using lighter materials unavailable during wartime. From 1952 the air-smoothed casing ahead of the cylinders was removed to ease maintenance and lubrication. This coincided with {{the removal of the}} tender 'raves' on all locomotives, as they obstructed the packing of coal into the bunker <b>and</b> <b>restricted</b> the driver's view when reversing the locomotive. The resultant 'cut-down' tender included new, enclosed storage for fire-irons, revised step ladders and glass spectacle plates to protect the crew from flying coal dust when running tender-first.|$|E

5|$|Bivalves {{vary greatly}} in overall shape. Some, {{such as the}} cockles, have shells that are nearly globular; cockles can jump by bending and {{straightening}} their foot. Others, such as the razor clams, are burrowing specialists with elongated shells and a powerful foot adapted for rapid digging. The shipworms, in the family Teredinidae have greatly elongated bodies, but their shell valves are much reduced <b>and</b> <b>restricted</b> to the anterior end of the body, where they function as scraping organs that permit the animal to dig tunnels through wood.|$|E
5|$|Brought by explorers, {{queen conch}} shells {{quickly became a}} popular asset in early modern Europe. In the late 17th century they were widely used as {{decoration}} over fireplace mantels and English gardens, among other places. In contemporary times, queen conch shells are mainly utilized in handicraft. Shells are made into cameos, bracelets and lamps, and traditionally as doorstops or decorations by families of seafaring men. The shell continues to be popular as a decorative object, though its export is now regulated <b>and</b> <b>restricted</b> by the CITES agreement. In modern culture, queen conch shells are often represented in everyday objects such as coins and stamps.|$|E
5|$|For over {{a century}} the water was {{supplied}} untreated. In the 1980s a dam at Westbury allowed selective pumping from the river and some improvement in water quality. As Hagley's water was not fully treated, {{from time to time}} contamination required boil-water notices. Sedimentation damaged hot-water cylinders <b>and</b> <b>restricted</b> supply due to the deposits left in the water delivery system. Work began in 2012 on a $5.5 million water treatment work at Westbury to supply Westbury, Hagley and Exton. This water treatment plant was opened by Ben Lomond Water in June 2013, supplying filtered and treated water to Hagley.|$|E
50|$|NO ACTION <b>and</b> <b>RESTRICT</b> {{are very}} much alike. The main {{difference}} between NO ACTION <b>and</b> <b>RESTRICT</b> is that with NO ACTION the referential integrity check is done after trying to alter the table. RESTRICT does the check before trying to execute the UPDATE or DELETE statement. Both referential actions act the same if the referential integrity check fails: the UPDATE or DELETE statement will result in an error.|$|R

5|$|For the JATO project, {{they were}} joined by Caltech {{mathematician}} Martin Summerfield and 18 workers supplied by the Works Progress Administration. Former colleagues like Qian were prevented from returning to the project by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), who ensured the secrecy of the operation <b>and</b> <b>restricted</b> the involvement of foreign nationals and political extremists. The FBI was satisfied that Parsons was not a Marxist but were concerned when Thelemite friend Paul Seckler used Parsons' gun in a drunken car hijacking, for which Seckler was imprisoned in San Quentin State Prison for two years. Englishman George Emerson replaced Arnold as the Group's official photographer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1929, the Mufti Haj Amin Al Husseinni ordered an opening be made at the {{southern}} end of the alleyway which straddled the Wall. The former cul-de-sac became a thoroughfare which led from the Temple Mount into the prayer area at the Wall. Mules were herded through the narrow alley, often dropping excrement. This, together with other construction projects in the vicinity, <b>and</b> <b>restricted</b> access to the Wall, resulted in Jewish protests to the British, who remained indifferent.|$|E
5|$|Interacting {{with the}} monsoon, Linfa brought heavy {{rainfall}} {{across much of}} the Philippines for several days, causing flooding and landslides that resulted in traffic accidents and power outages. Across Luzon, Linfa damaged 198houses and destroyed another seven, causing ₱214.6 million ($4.8 million USD) in damage. The storm briefly threatened Taiwan, prompting warnings <b>and</b> <b>restricted</b> ferry travel. Over China, Linfa produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds that wrecked 288homes. Damage in the country totaled ¥1.7billion ($284million USD), and there was one death.|$|E
