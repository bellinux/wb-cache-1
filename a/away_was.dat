Kaldalis was impressed by Artanis' vision of a unified protoss society, the Daelaam: incorporating the cultures of Khalai, Nerazim, Tal'Darim and Purifiers.|$|E

5|$|Miyazaki {{had wanted}} to produce a new film for years, but his two {{previous}} proposals (one based on the Japanese book Kirino Mukouno Fushigina Machi, and another about a teenage heroine) were rejected. Miyazaki's third proposal, which ended up becoming Sen and Chihiro Spirited <b>Away,</b> <b>was</b> more successful. The three stories revolved around a bathhouse that was inspired by one in Miyazaki's hometown. Miyazaki thought the bathhouse was a mysterious place, {{and there was a}} small door next to one of the bathtubs in the bathhouse. Miyazaki was always curious to what was behind it, and he made up several stories about it, one of which inspired the bathhouse setting of Spirited Away.|$|E
5|$|For two {{or three}} days, Rome {{remained}} without an emperor. By April 11, Macrinus had proclaimed himself emperor and assumed all of the imperial titles and powers, without waiting for the Senate. The army backed his claim as emperor and the Senate, so far <b>away,</b> <b>was</b> powerless to intervene. Macrinus never returned to Rome as emperor and remained based in Antioch {{for the duration of}} his reign. Macrinus was the first emperor to hail from the equestrian class, rather than the senatorial and also the first emperor of Mauretanian descent. He adopted the name of Severus, in honor of the Severan dynasty, and conferred the imperial title of Augusta to his wife Nonia Celsa and the title of Caesar and name of Antoninus to his son Diadumenianus in honor of the Antonine dynasty, thus making him second in command. At the time of Diadumenian's accession he was eight years old.|$|E
5|$|Fulton led the NZRB {{during the}} {{successful}} Battle of Messines in June 1917, but took ill {{immediately after the}} battle and was hospitalised for several days. Shortly after {{his return to the}} front lines in late July, he was appointed commander of the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade Reserve Camp, better known as Sling Camp, for a three-month period. In his absence, the NZRB participated in the Battle of Passchendaele in October. Its morale already low because of the loss of two successive commanders, and lacking in preparation for the latter battle having been employed during the previous month in laying cables and constructing banking, the brigade's losses during Passchendaele were significant. Fulton returned to the brigade in November, and despite his time <b>away,</b> <b>was</b> awarded the Croix de Guerre in December 1917.

5|$|In 1982, Morrissey {{auditioned for}} One Summer, a {{television}} series by Willy Russell for Yorkshire Television and Channel 4 about two Liverpool boys who run away to Wales one summer. Russell had been {{attached to the}} Everyman for many years, and Morrissey had seen {{him while he was}} working behind the bar downstairs from the theatre, though the two had never been introduced. Morrissey went to at least eight auditions, and in one read for the part of Icky opposite Paul McGann, who was reading for Billy. McGann, five years older than Morrissey, believed that he was too old to be playing the part of 16-year-old Billy, and stepped back from the production, leaving the role to go to Morrissey. Spencer Leigh got the part of Icky and Ian Hart played the supporting role of Rabbit. Russell had a professional disagreement with the director Gordon Flemyng and producer Keith Richardson over the casting of 18-year-old Morrissey and Leigh; he believed that the sympathy of 16-year-olds running <b>away</b> <b>was</b> lost by casting older actors. Russell subsequently had his name removed from the credits of the original broadcast. After filming One Summer for five months, Morrissey went travelling in Kenya with his cousins. When he returned to Britain, One Summer was being broadcast, and he dealt with the new experience of being recognised in public.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, rival {{soap opera}} Home and Away emerged as {{more popular than}} Neighbours in Australia. As of 2004, Neighbours was {{regularly}} attracting just under a million viewers per episode. In 2007, Home and <b>Away</b> <b>was</b> averaging 1.4million viewers in Australia to Neighbours 700,000.

Ratings for that episode averaged 1.05million viewers in the 6:30pm. slot. It {{was the first time the}} programme's viewing figures had topped 1million in 2007. By the end of 2007 it was reported that producers had hoped the Neighbours revamp would push the ratings up to between 900,000 to 1million an episode. It had, however, resulted in a more modest boost, with ratings hovering at about 800,000 a night. The same viewing period had shown an increase in ratings for Home and Away, which was now averaging 1.4million viewers every night.|$|E
