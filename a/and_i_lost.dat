25|$|When I first {{played for}} South Australia, I did all right. Then I got injured {{right at the}} start of the second season – I broke my nose and cheekbone in a fielding accident. I damaged my {{shoulder}} as well. I couldn't throw very well. Fielding has always been one of my main skills <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> confidence in the fielding. I wasn't getting any runs, I wasn't bowling much in those days, and I wasn't fielding terribly well either. I ended up playing all of the first-class season and had a bad season. I still couldn't get runs in South Australia the following season but I'd go to England and get runs. I got dropped from the South Australian team.|$|E

500|$|I won the primary, but {{not with}} fifty-one percent of the vote. We had a runoff <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> by two hundred votes – to a machine candidate. We were {{bringing}} fresh ideas, but we were not experienced in fighting the machine on election day. I swore I'd never run for alderman again. There was so much racial baiting that it was terrifying. I was called names. ... My posters had black paint all over them with racial epithets. It was very disturbing.|$|E
500|$|In his autobiography, Darwin {{said he had}} [...] "gained much by my {{delay in}} {{publishing}} from about 1839, when the theory was clearly conceived, to 1859; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> nothing by it". On {{the first page of}} his 1859 book he noted that, having begun work on the topic in 1837, he had drawn up [...] "some short notes" [...] after five years, had enlarged these into a sketch in 1844, and [...] "from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Moss, Peggy [...] "has the {{capability}} of being a Don Draper, and there can't be {{two of them in}} the office." [...] The goodbye scene between Don and Peggy was a difficult one to shoot. Moss said, [...] "That scene was a really, really tough scene to do. They didn't tell me {{they were going to do}} this, but they told Jon to hold my hand and not let it go. Then he did, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> it. Every single one of those tears were absolutely real. She wants to stay with all of her heart. She does not want to leave, but she knows she has to." [...] Hamm said there was [...] "respect, understanding, and admiration between those two characters. This is the exact right time for her to leave." ...|$|E

2500|$|During his posting in Sopore, Batra {{had several}} {{encounters}} with militants. In {{one of those}} encounters when Batra was leading an ambush with his platoon into an area of dense forest, he had a miraculous escape when a bullet fired by a militant grazed his shoulder and struck one of Batra's men behind him, killing the soldier. Believing that the bullet was meant for him and not his colleague, he ordered his men to nab the militants, and by morning all of the militants were killed. Batra, however, was saddened, {{because he knew that}} the bullet was meant for him. [...] "Didi, it was meant for me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> my man," [...] he had told his elder sister over the phone.|$|E
2500|$|After Apollo, the Saturn V {{was planned}} to be the prime launch vehicle for Prospector {{intended}} to land a [...] robotic rover on the Moon, similar to the Soviet Lunokhod, and the Voyager Mars probes, as well a scaled-up version of the Voyager interplanetary probes. It was also {{to have been the}} launch vehicle for the nuclear rocket stage RIFT test program and the later NERVA. All of these planned uses of the Saturn V were cancelled, with cost being a major factor. Edgar Cortright, who had been director of NASA Langley, stated decades later that [...] "JPL never liked the big approach. They always argued against it. I probably was the leading proponent in using the Saturn V, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lost.</b> Probably very wise that I lost." ...|$|E
2500|$|Snow Patrol's frontman, Gary Lightbody, {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} writing [...] "Run" [...] in 2000. In an interview with Michael Odell, from Q magazine, Lightbody explained the song was not written about [...] "being a child", as he tended to say. He described: [...] "I was on a massive bender and one night I was drinking in the bar of the Glasgow School of Art. I fell down a full flight of stairs. Jonny Quinn found me in the stairwell with blood {{coming out of my}} head ... I split my head open and my eye was closed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> a few teeth ... I wrote Run soon after on this little guitar I'd tried to smash up in my shitty little room near Hillhead. The words 'Light up, light up' gave me this sense of a beacon." [...] In an interview with Daily Mail in 2009, Lightbody added: [...] "We had nothing. I was in a flat in Glasgow. No doubt it was raining. The song was me writing about an imagined world, projecting myself into better times." [...] Beside Lightbody, it was written by Quinn, Nathan Connolly, Mark McClelland and Iain Archer.|$|E

6000|$|... "And after that," [...] he pursued, [...] "Mr. Sewell {{got me a}} place, a sort of servant's place, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> that <b>I</b> came to be the man-of-all work at the St. Albans." ...|$|R
2500|$|Prior {{to public}} release, Meirelles {{screened}} Blindness to test audiences. He described {{the impact of}} test screenings: [...] "If {{you know how to}} use it, how to ask the right questions, it can be really useful." [...] A test screening of Meirelles' first cut in Toronto resulted in ten percent of the audience, nearly 50 people, walking out of the film early. Meirelles ascribed the problem to a rape scene that takes place partway through the film, and edited the scene to be much shorter in the final cut. Meirelles explained his goal, [...] "When I shot and edited these scenes, I did it in a very technical way, I worried about how to light it and so on, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> the sense of their brutality. Some women were really angry with the film, and I thought, 'Wow, maybe I crossed the line.' I went back not to please the audience but so they would stay involved {{until the end of the}} story." [...] He also found that a New York City test screening expressed concern about a victim in the film failing to take revenge. Meirelles believed this concern to reflect what Americans have learned to expect in their cinema.|$|E
