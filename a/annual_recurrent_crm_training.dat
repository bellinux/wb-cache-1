40|$|Crew Resource Management (CRM) is {{a widely}} {{implemented}} strategy in the aviation community as a training countermeasure to human error. The two most accessible criteria for <b>CRM</b> <b>training</b> evaluation are behaviour on line operation and attitudes showing acceptance or rejection of CRM concepts. The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate <b>CRM</b> <b>training</b> effectiveness for cabin crew, achieved by assessing cabin crew's attitudes toward CRM and their performance during a the training drill. A questionnaire was created for assessing attitudes toward <b>CRM</b> and <b>CRM</b> <b>training</b> from the flight attendants' perspective at Air New Zealand. Comparing attitudes prior to and post the training suggested that the joint <b>CRM</b> <b>training</b> had a positive effect. The joint <b>CRM</b> <b>training</b> improved cabin crew's confidence in safety operation and commitment to their safety role. As some factors, such as job position, gender, age, work-year, aircraft type were likely to affect crewmembers' attitudes toward CRM, the survey also tried to test and finally disclosed that at least job position and gender had an effect on cabin crew attitudes. A series of behavioural markers were developed to measure cabin crew performance during a fire fighting drill. The observation results showed such behavioural markers were useful for assessing flight attendants' CRM skills and indicating the strength and weakness of cabin crew CRM skills showed in the fire fighting drills. In general the study suggests the overall <b>CRM</b> <b>training</b> in Air New Zealand is successful.

40|$|Introduction: Evidence {{suggests}} that Crew Resource Management (CRM), {{a form of}} team training, is beneficial. In <b>CRM</b> <b>training,</b> participants learn individual portable team skills such as communication and decision making through group discussion and activities. However, the usual 1 -day course format is not always compatible with health care organizational routines. A modular training format, while theoretically sound, is untested for interprofessional team training. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the potential for modularized <b>CRM</b> <b>training</b> to be delivered to a group of interprofessional learners. Method: Modularized <b>CRM</b> <b>training,</b> consisting of two 2 -hour workshops, was delivered to health care workers in an Australian tertiary hospital. Kirkpatrick's evaluation model provided a framework for the study. Baseline attitude surveys were conducted prior to each workshop. Participants completed a written questionnaire at the end of each workshop that examined their motivations, reactions to the training, and learner demographics. An additional survey, administered 6 weeks post training, captured self-assessed behavior data. Results: Twenty-three individuals from a range of professions and clinical streams participated. One in 5 participants (22 %) reported that they translated teamwork skills to the workplace. While positive about the workshop format and content, many respondents identified personal, team, and organizational barriers to the application of the workshop techniques. Discussion: <b>CRM</b> <b>training</b> when delivered in a modular format has positive outcomes. Following the training, some respondents overcame workplace barriers to attempt to change negative workplace behavior. This progress provides cautious optimism for the potential for modular <b>CRM</b> <b>training</b> to benefit groups of interprofessional health staff. 12 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{reports on}} the {{experience}} of a research team in developing, implementing and evaluating resource management procedures at two airlines. This project arose from the synthesis of three factors. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) wanted to evaluate a proceduralized form of Crew Resource Management (CRM). A regional airline wanted to upgrade its <b>CRM</b> <b>training</b> by customizing it to its operational needs. Our research team was involved in applied aviation research and was interested in developing and testing an innovative approach to <b>CRM</b> <b>training.</b> This chapter will describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of proceduralized additions to CRM at a regional airline, and the development, implementation, and planned evaluation of one aspect of this work at a major airline. The chapter will conclude with the lessons learned from these efforts. EXPERIENCES WITH A REGIONAL AIRLINE The goals of the work with our regional airline were to develop and implement a comprehensive, procedurally-based <b>CRM</b> <b>training</b> program and evaluate the effects of this specific <b>CRM</b> <b>training</b> on the performance of flight crews. The effort was unique in that it took the philosophy and principles of CRM that are typically only taught in the classroom and implemented them into standard operating procedures (SOP). The implementation included changes to normal briefings used on a regular basis as well as changes to checklists and procedures in the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) that pilots use in abnormal or emergency situations...|$|R
40|$|The {{detailed}} {{content of}} the <b>CRM</b> <b>training</b> component of the C- 5 Aircrew Training System (ATS) was left to {{the discretion of the}} contractor. As a part of determining what the content should be, United Airlines Services Corporation has made an effort to understand how the needs of MAC crews compare with those of civilian airline crews. There are distinct similarities between the crew roles in the cockpits of civilian airliners and military air transports. Many of the attitudes and behaviors exhibited by civil and military crew members are comparable, hence much of the training in the field referred to as Cockpit Resource Management (CRM) is equally appropriate to civil or military aircrews. At the same time, there are significant differences which require assessment to determine if modifications to what might be termed generic CRM are necessary. The investigation enabled the definition and specification of <b>CRM</b> <b>training</b> which is believed {{to address the needs of}} the C- 5 operational community.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that poor non-technical skills, such as crew communication and coordination, in aircrew, are antecedents to accidents and incidents in aviation. Crew Resource Management (<b>CRM)</b> <b>training</b> has developed over the last 20 years {{in response to the}} need to educate crews in resource management, decision-making, situational awareness and other human factors related topics. This current study sought to evaluate the <b>CRM</b> <b>training</b> currently administered by the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF). Evaluation was made on three of Kirkpatrick's levels; reaction, learning and behaviour. Personality as a mediator in the relationship of CRM attitudes to behaviour was also investigated. Finally personality differences in the sample were identified. Results showed that the RNZAF <b>CRM</b> <b>training</b> was perceived by aircrew as useful and 100 % of trainees felt this training should be offered to all aircrew. At the learning level of evaluation the results revealed a positive attitude change in one scale of the Cockpit Management Attitudes Questionnaire - 'Recognition of Stressors'. The personality trait Agreeableness was found to mediate the relationship between attitudes and behaviour post <b>CRM</b> <b>training.</b> Agreeableness and Conscientiousness also explained 25 % of the variance in scores of CRM behaviours. Finally it was established that pilots display higher levels of Instrumentality and lower levels of Neuroticism than non-pilot aircrew. Officers display higher levels of Extroversion and lower levels of Expressivity than Non Commissioned Officers. The results are discussed in terms of their implication for future RNZAF research and training. Limitations of the current study and areas for future research are presented...|$|R
