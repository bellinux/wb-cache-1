25|$|Einstein {{acknowledged}} {{the controversy over}} his derivation in his 1907 survey paper on special relativity. There he notes that it is problematic to rely on Maxwell's equations for the heuristic mass–energy argument. The argument in his 1905 paper {{can be carried out}} with the emission of any massless particles, but the Maxwell equations are implicitly used to make it obvious that the emission of light in particular can be achieved only by doing work. To emit electromagnetic waves, <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do is shake a charged particle, and this is clearly doing work, so that the emission is of energy.|$|E

This service will be available sometime early year 2014. Volunteer doctors of Global Clinic have tried to help these people, for whom only acute care has been available.

500|$|Webber's orchestral accompaniment added a {{different}} level to the track, with its composition consisting of pizzicato strings, and its flowing tempo introducing Covington's opening vocals. The song jumps from being light to heavy and extravagant, with one section of it being hummed by choral voices.

According to the sheet music published by Music Sales Group, the song starts with a sequence of G/D–A7/D–D–Bm/D, changes to E–E/D–A/C–E7–A–D, with the chorus featuring a chord progression of A–Bm–Dmaj7–Gmaj7–G–Fm7. The song is composed in the key of C major with Covington's vocals spanning from the nodes of E3 to G5.|$|E

500|$|When Stephen King {{created the}} {{character}} of Flagg, he based him around what he believed evil represented. To King, Flagg is [...] "somebody who’s very charismatic, laughs a lot, [...] tremendously attractive {{to men and women}} both, and [...] somebody who just appeals to the worst in all of us". This idea carries over into The Stand, in which Flagg first appears as the personification of evil opposing Mother Abagail, the personification of good. Character Tom Cullen ascribes to Flagg the ability to kill animals and inflict cancer at will, referring to him as the demon Legion, while character Glen Bateman refers to him as the Lovecraftian entity Nyarlathotep, among other ancient names. King wanted Flagg to embody a [...] "gigantic evil", although he intended the character to weaken by the end of The Stand. He said, [...] "I think the Devil is probably a pretty funny guy. Flagg is like the archetype of everything that I know about real evil, going back all the way to Charles Starkweather in the '50s—he is somebody who is empty and who has to be filled with other people's hates, fears, resentments, laughs. Flagg, Koresh, Jim Jones, Hitler—they're all basically the same guy". Although Flagg was not intended to represent Satan, this did not detract from what King sees as his ultimate goal. He notes that no matter who sees him or how he is seen as Flagg appears differently to different individuals, his message is the same: [...] "I know all the things that you want and I can give them to you and <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do is give me your soul".|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2008–09 NHL season, Panthers head coach Peter DeBoer, who first saw Horton play at seven years old, said about his hopes for Horton, [...] "If I'm looking for guys to do more, he wouldn't be at the top of the list. If he can give us 30-plus, I'd be happy with Nathan. There's a group of guys {{underneath}} him that I think can make a lot bigger jumps than I need out of Nathan Horton goal-wise." [...] Horton was also moved from his position of right wing to centre before the season. After playing a few games at centre, Horton said, [...] "It's not as easy as wing. You can play wing and <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> concentrate on is getting the puck and shooting it. At center, you have more responsibilities." [...] Against the Nashville Predators on November 1, Horton played in his 300th career game, but failed to record a point. On November 26, Horton suffered a deep cut in his leg after it was stepped on by a skate. At the time of the injury, Horton had 6 goals and 7 assists. In early December, the Ottawa Sun reported that the Panthers might have been looking to trade Horton after he was reportedly unhappy playing for the team. Horton returned to the lineup on December 17 after missing eight games. After the game, Horton commented, [...] "I'm excited to play. It's kind of a different Panthers team than the past. It's really changed in a matter of a month. Things are going good now, and everybody's really buying into what Pete has been telling us all year." [...] On January 17, Horton recorded 3 assists to help the Panthers defeat Tampa Bay, 43. For the second time during the season, Horton's name came up in trade rumours, this time with the Chicago Blackhawks. In early March, days after the trade deadline, Horton suffered a finger injury that forced him to have surgery. He returned to the lineup on March 23, recording an assist in a Panthers loss to the Carolina Hurricanes. Horton ended the season with 22 goals and 23 assists in 67 games.|$|E

2500|$|On November 2, Interplay {{announced}} the game had been finalized {{and was ready}} for manufacture, with a release date set for November 12. The game entered the manufacturing stage on November 5. On November 8, IGN gave a full preview, again praising the graphics, and writing [...] "This game is running on a rock-solid 3D engine with completely rotatable dungeons, brilliant animation for nearly every interactive element (of which there are many), and first-rate lighting effects of all different kinds [...] In the beginning, simple refined touches are impressive, amid the generally sharp atmosphere of the game (while there is no visible aliasing, the graphics aren't heavily filtered, either). Even when <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fight are rats, and <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fight with is a dagger, you can admire how barrels come apart when you smash them, in realistically shaded pieces and a puff of dust, or all the different limbs you can bloodily excise from your foes."

2500|$|In the March 2010 {{print edition}} of British enthusiast {{magazine}} EVO (p.120), editor Richard Meaden {{was the first}} to review the all-new right-hand-drive version of the Roadster. He said the car had [...] "serious, instantaneous muscle". [...] "With so much torque from literally no revs the acceleration punch is wholly alien.

2500|$|Falling coconut {{injuries}} were {{featured in the}} American television series Gilligan's Island. [...] A June 1965 episode revolved around an injury sustained by Gilligan after a falling coconut {{hit him in the}} nose. [...] Actor Bob Denver explained the success of the series as follows: [...] "Little kids seem to love it. [...] It doesn't take a great intellect or reasoning power to be able to laugh at a monkey running off with Gilligan's dinner or a guy getting conked on the head by a coconut." [...] When Denver died, the show's creator Sherwood Schwartz said that Denver didn't get enough credit for his talent as a slapstick actor: [...] "A lot of people don't think it's hard to be an actor where <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do is react to a falling coconut." [...] In the film Cast Away, the stranded character played by Tom Hanks is alarmed several times by loud thuds, which he cannot identify. He finally sees a coconut fall, making the sound.|$|E
2500|$|Influenced heavily by DIY culture, most bands' {{presentation}} subverted traditional or classically trained 'musicianship' {{in favor}} of raw, primitive, avant-lo-fi passion and fiercely deliberate amateurism: [...] an idea growing rapidly in popularity, especially in the Olympia music scene, with bands like Beat Happening coining the slogans: [...] "Learn how to NOT play your instrument" [...] and [...] "hey, you don't have to sound like {{the flavor of the}} month, <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do is sound like yourselves", arguing that traditional musical skill doesn't ultimately matter and should always be subservient to the passion, the fun and ideas in their music. [...] This argument is similar to the ideological origins of punk rock itself, which started partially as an attempt to dissolve the growing division between audience and performer. [...] These indie-punk bands (and riot grrrl bands in particular) were often ridiculed for [...] "not being able to play their instruments", but fans are quick to counter that identical criticisms were often faced by the first-wave of punk rock bands in the 1970s, and that this DIY garage amateurism [...] "play just 'cause you wanna, no matter what" [...] attitude {{was one of the most}} appealing and liberating aspects of both movements.|$|E
2500|$|However, some reviews viewed that {{similarity}} as positive, {{and perceived}} it more as progression and evolution than repetition. Stylus Magazine repeated similar sentiments {{as those of}} the previous reviews, but did not feel that re-using a successful formula was a burden, Cosmo Lee saying [...] "it's not Isis' fault that they sound unoriginal these days. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do is pick up a copy of Decibel, open it to any page, and you’ll find someone counting the group as an influence [...] The songs are still long, the rhythms are still organic, and in general Isis still sounds like Isis". Despite having said this, the review is still very positive. PopMatters repeated the views of Lee, stating Isis are [...] "a band knowing how to execute the formula to near-perfection", and Thom Jurek of Allmusic expanded upon that point further, stating [...] "this set is not a brave leap [...] but a further look up the holy mountain to a new plateau, a hike to sacred ground". Drowned in Sound reviewer Mike Diver, however, viewed the album differently; that Isis have [...] "pushed themselves on this album, striving to achieve something honestly different to what was released before it". An IGN review described it as [...] "unique and free from boundaries", and it has been labeled as [...] "Isis' masterpiece", as well as their [...] "most compelling work to date". Writing for Alternative Press, Aaron Burgess states that [...] "save for the brief distorted squalls of [...] "Garden of Light" [...] and the pummeling metallic grooves of [...] "Not In Rivers, But In Drops," [...] there's barely anything keeping Isis tethered to the rigid [...] "post-metal" [...] genre they helped inspire".|$|E
