40|$|We report {{engineering}} experiences {{from the}} critical task of relief well installation under high <b>artesian</b> <b>flow</b> {{conditions at the}} downstream toe of the Karkheh earth dam, Iran. Due {{to the establishment of}} excessive uplift pressure at the downstream toe of the Karkheh dam, installation of a series of new relief wells was considered to permanently relieve part of these pressures. The mentioned uplift pressure, as high as around 30 m above the ground level, was produced in a confined conglomerate aquifer bounded above and below by relatively impervious mudstone layers which reduced the safety factor of the dam toe to below 1. 0. Investigations on the shortcomings of the old relief wells installed at the dam site showed that the main problems were: insufficient well numbers, insufficient well diameters, irregular well screens causing their blockage by time passing, and insufficient total opening area. Despite engineering difficulties and associated risk of downstream toe instability, installation of new relief wells was successfully completed under high <b>artesian</b> <b>flow</b> conditions ” was successfully completed.

40|$|The {{piezometric head}} in {{artesian}} groundwater oscillates remarkably due to oceanic tide. As is well known, {{the effect of}} the tide on the piezometric head prevails even in far inland. The artesian groundwater is generally a very good source of drinking water, because of the purification properties of the soils; it is also used for irrigation, and, where surface water is scarce, for industrial purposes. A large quantity of discharge from an aquifer produces a reduction in water pressure and therefore, at the same time, an increase in the effective stress in the soil skeleton of the porous medium. The latter produces land subsidence (or consolidation) and sea water may infiltrate into artesian groundwater.

40|$|The {{issue of}} natural and forced {{groundwater}} movements, {{and its effect on}} the performance of ground heat exchangers is of great importance for the design and sizing of borehole thermal energy systems (BTESs). In Scandinavia groundwater filled boreholes in hard rock are commonly used. In such boreholes one or more intersecting fractures provide a path for groundwater flow between the borehole and the surrounding rock. An enhanced heat transport then occurs due to the induced convective water flow, driven by the volumetric expansion of heated water. Warm groundwater leaves through fractures in {{the upper part of the}} borehole while groundwater of ambient temperature enters the borehole through fractures at larger depths. This temperature driven flow is referred to as thermosiphon, and may cause considerable increase in the heat transport from groundwater filled boreholes. The thermosiphon effect is connected to thermal response tests, where the effective ground thermal conductivity is enhanced by this convective transport. Strong thermosiphon effects have frequently been observed in field measurements. The character of this effect is similar to that of <b>artesian</b> <b>flow</b> through boreholes.

40|$|Abstract. In northwestern Pennsylvania (USA), {{numerous}} abandoned {{natural gas}} wells are producing <b>artesian</b> <b>flows</b> of Fe-contaminated water. The {{origin of the}} polluted water has been generally assumed to be brines from the gas-producing sands. We sampled 20 artesian discharges where iron staining was conspicuous. The waters were not brines, but were more characteristic of acid mine drainage (AMD). The dominant cations were Fe, Ca, and Mg, while the dominant anion was sulfate. The study area {{has a long history}} of coal mining in the lower Allegheny formation; however, the coal beds are generally at higher elevations than the discharges. We propose that AMD formed in the coal mines is infiltrating into lower aquifers, moving outside the lateral limits of mining, and using abandoned gas wells as conduits to the surface. While flowing through the underlying sandstones, the AMD chemistry is modified by contact with siderite, the dominant carbonate mineral in this stratigraphy. This would suggest that current remediation strategies that emphasize plugging the pollution-producing gas wells may be ill-advised because the source of the polluted water is more shallow than currently assumed.

Geothermal brine, deriving from this area, contains an abundance of NaCl and a water temperature of 173 °C (T 1 well at 814 m depth) is typically encountered. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the hydrogeochemical properties of the geothermal brine using both chemical and isotopic data, and to investigate the origin of the geothermal brine in the Tuzla area and the environmental impacts of Tuzla Geothermal Field (TGF). Both geothermal brine and shallow groundwater in the area are of meteoric origin. Isotope results indicate that the hot saline waters (brine) in the Tuzla geothermal field originate from connate water along faults. As the saline water rises to the surface, it mixes with shallow groundwaters in various ratios. In addition, the high sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) content in the Tuzla Stream, fed from the Tuzla geothermal brine during the dry season, cause an increase in sodium and chloride concentrations in the shallow groundwaters by infiltration into the aquifer.

40|$|Stratigraphic {{reservoirs}} {{are attractive}} candidates for geothermal power production {{due to their}} high permeability and large areal extent, compared to typical hydrothermal geothermal reservoirs. Because they are often associated with a conductive thermal regime that require greater depths to reach economic temperatures, the commercial viability of stratigraphic reservoir systems will depend on leveraging greater fluid production rates per well and on limiting the parasitic costs associated with fluid recirculation. We present an approach to address these challenges. To increase fluid-recirculation efficiency and fluid production rates, we inject supplemental working fluids (CO 2 and/or N 2) with advantageous properties to augment reservoir pressure. Because N 2 can be readily separated from air, pressure augmentation can occur during periods of low grid power demand, which will reduce parasitic costs and enable bulk energy storage. A well pattern consisting of four concentric rings of horizontal producers and injectors is used to store pressure and supplemental fluids, segregate the supplemental fluid and brine production zones, and generate large <b>artesian</b> <b>flow</b> rates to better leverage the productivity of horizontal wells.

Using {{data from the}} Pages Creek estuary in the Cape Fear region of southeastern North Carolina, we show that the concentration and carbon isotopic composition (� 14 C and � 13 C values) of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) can provide a tracer of a single, well-defined component of the surface water-groundwater system in coastal regions— the integrated freshwater discharge to an estuary from confined aquifers. Groundwater from the two shallowest confined aquifers in the Cape Fear region (the Castle Hayne and the Peedee) has DIC � 14 C values ranging from � 282 ‰ to � 829 ‰, {{significantly lower than the}} radiocarbon content of surficial (water table) groundwater, rivers and streams, and seawater in the area (� 14 C �� 38 ‰ to � 97 ‰).

However, none of these processes results in strongly depleted DIC � 14 C values. Because artesian springs are the only significant low- � 14 C DIC input to the Pages Creek estuary, flood-ebb 14 C budgets provide a direct measure of the fraction of the total freshwater inputs to the Pages Creek estuary that is derived from artesian discharge.

40|$|A process-based {{numerical}} modelling tool is developed, designed {{to support the}} charcterisation of karst aquifers using two complementary approaches: Firstly, the simulation of solutional conduit enlargement, which aims at predicting aquifer properties by forward modelling of karst genesis; secondly, the simulation of heat and solute transport, which aims at inferring aquifer properties from short-term karst spring responses. Karst genesis modelling is applied to a conceptual setting based on field observations from the Western Ukraine, where gypsum layers are typically supplied by <b>artesian</b> <b>flow</b> of aggressive water from insoluble aquifers underneath. Processes and parameters, controlling solutional enlargement of single conduits under artesian conditions, are identified in detailed sensitivity analyses. The development of conduit networks is examined in parameter studies, suggesting that the evolution of maze caves is predetermined by structural preferences such as laterally extended fissure networks beneath a horizon less prone to karstification. Short-term karst spring response after recharge events is firstly examined in parameter studies by forward modelling. The numerical simulations reveal that different controlling processes of heat and solute transport account for the different behaviour of water temperature and solute concentration frequently observed at karst springs.

The purpose of these studies is to understand the chemical phenomena occurring in the geothermal loop and to determine the treatment of the fluid and the exploitation procedures necessary for proper reinjection conditions to be achieved.

The removal from the waters of these elements is presumably due to such processes as physical retention (filtration) of metal-bearing atmospheric aerosols by organic and mineral soil components as well as adsorption and surface complexation of ionic species onto organic, metal oxyhydroxide and clay mineral surfaces. In the case of Pb, the removal processes are so effective that apparently ''natural'' ratios of Pb to Sc are found in the groundwaters. Tritium measurements show that the groundwater at one of the sites is modern (ie not more than 30 years old) meaning that the inputs of Pb and other trace elements to the groundwaters may originally have been much higher than they are today; the M/Sc ratios measured in the groundwaters today, therefore, represent a conservative estimate of the extent of metal removal along the flow path. Lithogenic elements significantly enriched in the groundwaters at both sites include Ba, Ca, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Rb, S, Si, Sr, and Ti. The abundance of these elements can largely be explained in terms of weathering of the dominant silicate (plagioclase, potassium feldspar, amphibole and biotite) and carbonate minerals (calcite, dolomite and ankerite) in the soils and sediments of the watershed. Arsenic, Mo, Te, and especially U are also highly enriched in the groundwaters, due to chemical weathering: these could easily be explained if there are small amounts of sulfides (As, Mo, Te) and apatite (U) in the soils of the source area.
