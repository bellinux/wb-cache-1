40|$|The {{competitive}} dialogue procedure {{is a new}} public procurement award procedure first introduced by the Directive 2004118 for the tender of particularly complex contracts, when contracting authorities consider {{that the use of}} the open or <b>restricted</b> <b>procedures</b> do not allow for the contract to be tendered. It is not intended to be adopted freely as the open or <b>restricted</b> <b>procedures,</b> but contracting authorities may use it only when the need arises and specific grounds for its use are fulfilled. The procedure was introduced with the stated objective of increasing the flexibility of procurement, which had been already identified as a shortcoming of previous existing EU procurement framework. This thesis studies how the {{competitive dialogue}} has been implemented in Portugal and Spain. It covers both the legal transposition and aspects of its practice in these countries., through the use of empirical research methods. Through his research, the author has found that the procedure was implemented very differently in Portugal and Spain with consequences on its use. This study has tried to highlight similarities and differences in the transposition, illustrate how the competitive dialogue is being used in Spain and explain why it is being used only sparingly in Portugal.

40|$|Abstract. We study a {{restriction}} of the classification procedure for EL ++ where the inference rule for complex role inclusion axioms (RIAs) is applied in a “left-linear ” way in analogy with the well-known procedure for computing the transitive closure of a binary relation. We introduce {{a notion of}} left-admissibility {{for a set of}} RIAs, which specifies when a subset of RIAs {{can be used in a}} left-linear way without loosing consequences, prove a criterion which can be used to effectively check this property, and describe some preliminary experimental results analyzing when the <b>restricted</b> <b>procedure</b> can give practical improvements. ...|$|R

In {{the first section of}} the thesis there is short excursion into history of public procurement. Second part is dealing with legislation regulating public procurement, namely European legislation, local laws and decrees. Third section is defining major terms relating to public procurement. In fourth section the discussed issues are being narrowed down to above-the-threshold public contracts, by which the usage of the <b>restricted</b> <b>procedure</b> is not limited by any conditions as other types of award procedures usually are. All other types of award procedures which can the contracting entity chose for above-the-threshold public contracts are shortly discussed in this section.
