5|$|Two {{additional}} realignments {{occurred at}} the north end of the Green Line, but with less acrimony. North of Fort Totten, the line was to have surfaced in the median of the planned North Central Freeway, I-95, and proceeded to a point just west of Prince George's Plaza, with an intermediate station at Chillum. I-95 and Metro would have run through the Northwest Branch Stream Valley Park; the cancellation of I-95 through the District <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Beltway in 1974 meant that it was no longer necessary or appropriate to condemn an I-95-sized swath of parkland just for Metro (as well as a Metro station and its parking lot). WMATA eventually selected a new route that skirted most of the park, and it was federally approved by the mid-1980s. The planned Chillum station was relocated and named West Hyattsville. The other alignment dispute occurred in the Petworth section of Washington, and involved whether the tunnel would go under or skirt Rock Creek Cemetery and how to go through this soft-soil burial ground (it was skirted using the New Austrian Tunnelling method), and the least disruptive way under New Hampshire Avenue from Georgia Avenue – Petworth to Columbia Heights (the tunnels were stacked).|$|E

25|$|The Saint Lawrence Seaway and Great Lakes Waterway {{make the}} Great Lakes {{accessible}} to ocean-going vessels. However, shifts in shipping to wider ocean-going container ships—which {{do not fit}} through the locks on these routes—have limited container shipping on the lakes.

Larger ships are confined to working in the lakes themselves. Only barges can access the Illinois Waterway system providing access to the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River. Despite their vast size, large sections of the Great Lakes freeze over in winter, interrupting most shipping from January to March. Some icebreakers ply the lakes, keeping the shipping lanes open through other periods of ice on the lakes.|$|E

25|$|In his Divina commedia ("Divine comedy"; set in {{the year}} 1300), Dante Alighieri {{employed}} the concept of taking Virgil as his guide through Inferno (and then, in the second canticle, up the mountain of Purgatorio). Virgil himself is not condemned to Hell proper in Dante's poem but is rather, as a virtuous pagan, confined to Limbo just {{at the edge of}} Hell. The geography of Hell is very elaborately laid out in this work, with nine concentric rings leading deeper into the Earth and deeper into the various punishments of Hell, until, {{at the center of the}} world, Dante finds Satan himself trapped in the frozen lake of Cocytus.

[...] Crew can also be moved onto the lee pod to provide additional heeling force in light winds, allowing the ama to lift under circumstances when it would not otherwise.

2500|$|In December 1770, a Doctor A. F. Shafonskiy, {{the chief}} {{physician}} at the Moscow General Hospital, identified {{a case of}} the bubonic plague and promptly reported it to German doctor A. Rinder, {{who was in charge of}} the public health of the city. [...] Unfortunately, Rinder did not trust the former’s judgment, and ignored the report. The next day, the Medical Council met and established the fact that the plague had entered the city, and informed the Senate in St. Petersburg. The response of the national government was to send military guards to the hospital in order to quarantine the cases. However, Shafonskiy and Rinder continued to stand on opposing sides, until Rinder denied Shafonskiy’s claim in January 1771. Shafonskiy submitted a report in February, arguing his case, but the officials chose to believe the German doctor instead. In March, there were definitive signs of the disease, and so Moscow’s government began implementing the established procedures, including setting up field hospitals. In June 1771, Rinder died after contracting the disease from a patient, and by September, the city was in the worst shape yet: the plague had peaked. 20,401 people died in that month alone, and roughly three quarters of Moscow’s population fled the city. [...] Authorities tried to stop the spread of the disease, but the poor were terrified of the destruction of their contaminated homes, and so hid dead bodies. This was likely one of the reasons that, in the aftermath, Catherine ordered the removal of all cemeteries from city centers <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> borders and suburbs.|$|E
