5|$|After her coronation, Anne {{settled into}} a quiet routine at the King's {{favourite}} residence, Greenwich Palace, {{to prepare for the}} birth of her baby. The child was born slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533. Between three and four in the afternoon, Anne gave birth to <b>a</b> <b>girl,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> christened Elizabeth, probably in honour of either or both Anne's mother Elizabeth Howard and Henry's mother, Elizabeth of York. But the birth of a girl was a heavy blow to her parents, since they had confidently expected a boy. All but one of the royal physicians and astrologers had predicted a son for them and the French king had already been asked to stand as his godfather. Now the prepared letters announcing the birth of a prince had an s hastily added to them to read princes and the traditional jousting tournament for the birth of an heir was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|At Massive Dynamic, Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes to {{the team}} that Observers are time travelers, {{as they have been}} {{documented}} during several major events in history. They write in an incomprehensible language, and the number of Observer sightings has increased over the past few months, leaving the team wondering why. Meanwhile, August visits the other Observers, who are not happy that he saved <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> supposed to die in the plane crash. To correct his mistake, they send Donald Long (Paul Rae), an assassin affiliated with the Observers to correct August's actions. In an attempt to save Christine, August sends a secret message to Walter. During the meeting, August reveals Christine will die because she is not important; Walter tells August that he has to make her important.|$|E

5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at the {{discourse}} level {{it tends to}} use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally {{has to be the}} grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> stung by a bee. Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{impact on}} men {{has also been}} {{especially}} credited.

[...] Driving home after rehearsal in April 1991, Kiedis thought of his heroin and cocaine addiction during his relationship with former girlfriend Ione Skye: [...] "the loneliness that I was feeling triggered memories of my time with Ione and how I'd had this beautiful angel of <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> willing to give me all of her love, and instead of embracing that, I was downtown with fucking gangsters shooting speedballs under a bridge." ...|$|E
500|$|Koda {{was born}} into a family of musicians.

Inspired by her mother, who performed in karaoke bars, Koda, from a young age, had aspirations of becoming a singer. Her school years were unhappy; she described her junior and high school years as [...] "obscure times", as she was ridiculed due to her [...] "fatness", [...] "shortness", [...] "ugliness", and other factors related to her appearance. During her second year of high school Koda auditioned in Avex’s [...] "Dream Audition", where she came in second out of 120,000participants. She was then signed onto the Avex sub-label Rhythm Zone.

500|$|On 11 June 1847, {{the young}} prince {{was playing in}} the library of the palace when he {{experienced}} a series of strong convulsions and died, not quite {{two and a half years}} old. His death revealed that Afonso suffered from epilepsy, as did his father. The grief of PedroII and his wife was enormous. It was feared that the shock might affect Teresa Cristina's health, as she was pregnant at the time with her third child. She later gave birth without complications on 13 July to <b>a</b> <b>girl,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> christened Leopoldina. The devastated emperor wrote a letter to his stepmother, the Empress Amélia, dated 11 July 1847, telling her of Afonso's death: [...] "With the most piercing grief I tell you that my little Afonso, your godson, unfortunately died of convulsions, which he suffered during five hours on the 4th of last month; and a few days ago little Isabel was put at risk by a strong attack of convulsions that greatly frightened me." ...|$|E
500|$|Besides {{acting in}} films, Khan {{is a social}} activist. He often speaks about issues related to Indian society and young people (including the {{elimination}} of violence against women, political awareness and sex education). In 2009, he participated in Eve Ensler's play The Vagina Monologues in celebration of completing 200 shows in India and V-Day. The event was a fundraiser whose beneficiaries included Haseena Hussein (<b>a</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> blinded and disfigured in an acid attack in Bangalore in 1999), and several other NGOs. Khan endorses People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), and has appeared {{in a number of}} advertisements in support of the organisation. In 2010 he appeared with his dog, Tony, urging viewers to adopt stray dogs instead of buying purebred animals. Khan filmed a second advertisement in 2011, titled [...] "Tony Changed My Life. You Can Change a Homeless Dog's Life. Please Adopt", after Tony's death in which he continued to advocate for the adoption of animals and not treating them as fashion statements.|$|E
500|$|When casting [...] "Tall Girl #1" [...] (the {{woman who}} would kiss with Dwight), the show {{was looking for a}} girl 6'1 or taller. Actress Cassie Fliegel, who is 5'11, auditioned for the part anyway. After getting a callback, Fliegel went to a gym to work out, {{attempting}} to gain muscle to look more like a basketball player. On the day of the callbacks, Fliegel remembers being next to <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> 6'8. Despite her size, Fliegel, a former basketball player herself, was cast for the part. Initially, she did not know that her character was going to make out with Dwight. Fliegel recalls that when she first heard about kissing Dwight she [...] "was like, I don't think so". However, after finding out that she had her own trailer, Fliegel warmed up to the idea. The music in the club was chosen by Novak, Kaling's then-boyfriend Benjamin Nugent, and Daniel Chun. When filming Ryan dancing in the club, the girl that Ryan hit was actually a stunt woman. Pads had been placed on the floor so Novak could fall down safely. The German lullaby that Dwight sang to Ryan was script supervisor Veda Semarne's idea. Semarne's Austrian grandmother sang the same song to her when she was a child.|$|E
