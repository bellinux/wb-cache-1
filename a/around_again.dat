5|$|Bob Holly and the 1–2–3 Kid faced Bam Bam Bigelow and Tatanka next in {{the final}} match of the WWF Tag Team Championship tournament. Tatanka began the match by using his {{strength}} against Holly, but Holly soon turned the match around by performing a hurricanrana throw. Bigelow used his strength against his opponents, but the 1–2–3 Kid performed a hurricanrana on him as well. Bigelow regained the advantage by kicking the Kid {{in the back of}} the head and controlled the match until the Kid threw him out of the ring. Bigelow and Tatanka turned the match <b>around</b> <b>again,</b> using power moves to wear down their opponents. At one point, Bigelow held the Kid for Tatanka to attack, but Tatanka accidentally hit Bigelow instead. The match ended in a similar manner, as Tatanka knocked Bigelow off the top rope when Bigelow attempted to perform a moonsault. The 1–2–3 Kid pinned Bigelow to win the match and the WWF Tag Team Championship. After the match, the crowd heckled Bigelow. He responded by pushing retired NFL player Lawrence Taylor, who was at ring side, laughing about Bigelow's loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{stranding}} of the Northern bottlenose whale mainly {{happens in}} two {{villages in the}} northern part of Suðuroy: Hvalba and Sandvík. It is believed that it happens because of a navigation problem of the whale, because there are isthmuses on these places, where the distance between the east and west coasts are short, around one kilometer or so. And for some reason it seems like the bottlenose whale want to take a short cut through what it thinks is a sound, and too late it discovers, that is on shallow ground and is unable to turn <b>around</b> <b>again.</b> It happened on 30 August 2012, when two Northern bottlenose whales swam ashore to the gorge Sigmundsgjógv in Sandvík. Two men who were working on the harbour noticed these whales, and some time later they had either died by themselves or were killed by the locals and then cut up for food for the people of Sandvík and Hvalba (Hvalba municipality).|$|E
25|$|Despite Maimon's order, the Wedgwood {{continued}} {{chasing the}} Egyptian corvette while coming {{under fire from}} the aircraft. At 12:25, its bow cannon was damaged, and it turned and fired from the stern, then <b>around</b> <b>again</b> when the bow cannon was repaired. The Haganah turned to assist the Wedgwood, but at 13:40 the Egyptian coastal battery came online and started firing at the Haganah. The Haganah turned <b>around</b> <b>again</b> toward the open sea. The Wedgwood was also hit by the shore cannons, suffering minor damage. At this point the corvette {{had gone out of}} range and the Wedgwood began to retreat north, but Egyptian Spitfires attacked it, dropping three bombs, one of which wounded a crew member.|$|E

25|$|Hungrybox matched {{off against}} {{returning}} champion Armada after beating Mango in the loser's bracket semifinals and Plup in the loser's finals. Armada played Fox {{in order to}} play against Hungrybox' Jigglypuff in his advantage, but lost {{the first two games}} due to accidentally losing lives. Armada made a comeback in the two games after that, but Hungrybox turned it <b>around</b> <b>again</b> and managed to beat Armada with a single stock left in the tenth game, winning the tournament.|$|E
25|$|The parkway {{begins at}} I-70, which is there {{concurrent}} with U.S. Highway 6 and U.S. Highway 40. At the interchange, CR 314 {{serves as a}} frontage road. Heading northward, the parkway abruptly turns left. After passing through several hills in a forested area, the road curves <b>around</b> <b>again</b> and heads northeastward, winding through hills. At the Clear Creek/Gilpin county line, the road turns northward, then northeastward, passing into a more heavily forested area. Through the drive, the road continues to wind between northward and westward before entering the vicinity of Central City, where it meets its terminus at Nevada Street. At the terminus, Nevada Street curves abruptly eastward, making both northward and eastward continuations at the intersection named as Nevada Street.|$|E

When this did not work out Niles shelved the idea until he showed it to IDW Publishing. IDW published the comic and Ben Templesmith provided the artwork. When Niles and his agent, Jon Levin, shopped the comic <b>around</b> <b>again</b> as a potential film adaptation, Niles found that the idea [...] "went shockingly well," [...] with Sam Raimi and Senator International picking up the property rights based on the original concept and Templesmith's unique mood and concepts for the vampires.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his next}} start on April 16, Holy Bull was the odds on {{favorite}} in the Blue Grass Stakes. He went to the early lead and set a moderate pace, then responded to a brief challenge by pulling away under a hand ride. The win earned Holy Bull a Beyer of 113. After the race, Smith was confident in the colt's ability to go an extra furlong in the upcoming Kentucky Derby. [...] "He would have gone <b>around</b> <b>again</b> today," [...] he said. [...] "I think he'll {{go as far as}} you want him. I'm not going to say no one can ever beat him, but when he runs his race, they've got to have their running shoes on.

2500|$|The ship's {{quarantine}} at Suva {{was apparently}} not mentioned on arrival in Apia (Cliff 137) and the acting Port Health officer at Apia {{was not aware}} of the epidemic in Auckland (Rice 200). After what {{seems to have been a}} somewhat cursory examination the ship was granted pratique and passengers allowed to disembark. [...] " [...] Talune's captain told the medical officer, Doctor Atkinson, that nothing was serious, but that [...] "'One old reverend told me he had been sick back in Auckland, but he seems fine now. Two Samoan kids, Tau and Faleolo, had headaches yesterday but are up and <b>around</b> <b>again</b> today.'" [...] The doctor [...] "questioned the pastor and two boys as they went by", but no one complained of being ill. Two hours later the yellow flag was lowered.

2500|$|The {{refloating}} {{of ships}} stranded or sunk in exposed waters is called offshore salvage. In {{this type of}} salvage, vessels are exposed to waves, currents and weather and are the most vulnerable and difficult to work on. They also tend to deteriorate more rapidly than such vessels in protected harbors. Offshore salvage may provide only a short window of opportunity for the salvage team due to unusually high tide or inclement weather for instance. The work window may not come <b>around</b> <b>again</b> {{for as long as}} weeks or months and in the interim, the vessel will continue to deteriorate. As a result, it is often imperative to work quickly. Typically, offshore salvage is conducted from pre-outfitted salvage tugs and other tugboats. In addition, portable diving facilities may be transported by helicopter or small boat to the work area. From a tactical point of view, working in unprotected waters is less hospitable for floating cranes, construction tenders, dredges and equipment barges. Plus, {{it is often difficult to}} depend upon a stable workforce (welders, carpenters, etc.) as all personnel must be present on site for the duration ...|$|E
