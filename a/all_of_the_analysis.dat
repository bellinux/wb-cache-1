The album holds {{a score of}} 89 out of 100 on the review aggregate site Metacritic, indicating [...] "universal acclaim." [...] Writing for Pitchfork Media, Scott Plagenhoef praised the album for its [...] "deceptively simple and very approachable tracks" [...] and remarked that songwriter Jeremy Greenspan was able [...] "to fold elements of nearly a quarter-century of forward-looking pop into a distinct sound without sounding either conceptual or trading on contradictions or the smoke-and-mirrors of attention-grabbing eclecticism." [...] The Guardians Dorian Lynskey stated that Junior Boys' [...] "spectral vision of electronic pop is an understated, unpredictable delight", while PopMatters Adrien Begrand called Last Exit [...] "a warm, friendly, entirely accessible pop album." [...] Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that the album's songs [...] "can be enjoyed with or without <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> and context" [...] and praised the duo's [...] "ability to be alluringly aloof". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called the album [...] "prettily nostalgic (think New Order, Erasure, Bronski Beat) and gloriously right now." ...|$|E

Interpreting response-generated stimuli {{as a form of}} positive reinforcement is contested, and an alternative interpretation is offered. A possibly simpler interpretation of the Sidman (1962) two-lever experiment is suggested. We question Dinsmoor's (2001) explanation for warning stimuli not being avoided, except for the reference to the weakness of third-order conditioning effects.

40|$|Despite the {{frequency}} of tax changes and their potential importance to investors, almost <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> of tax-based investment incentives assumes investors never anticipate any tax changes. We depart from this approach by analyzing the historical pattern of U.

Our analysis incorporates a predictive equation for future tax variables into a model of optimal investment subject to adjustment costs and uncertainty. We find that expectations of future tax changes significantly affect the incentive to invest only if adjustment costs are low. In this case, the incentive to invest in 1986 was strong, as investors are estimated to have anticipated the coming reduction in investment incentives. ...|$|E
