In the clock format, usage of lifelines temporarily paused the clock while the lifelines were played.|$|E

Until the mid-1960s the Irish stamp-issuing policy was very conservative, {{with only a few}} new ones each year; up to four or five commemoratives, usually of two values, plus the occasional updated, or new, definitives. During the 1970s and beyond, the quantity produced rose considerably.|$|E
5|$|Twelve Knights <b>are</b> <b>available</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> start (including Arthur King), {{each with}} his own weapon, {{personality}} and statistics for life force, defense, strength and speed.

5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, the nearly-40-year-old {{station and the}} older {{platforms}} were crumbling. Since the Newburyport/Rockport line {{was no longer a}} freight clearance route past the General Electric plant in West Lynn, a full-length high-level platform was built to replace the 1952 platforms. The wide platform occupies the width of one former island platform plus one track slot, with the line's two current tracks on each side. The 800-foot-long platform is located west of the older low platforms, which are still extant on the viaduct. A 930-space parking garage with a drop-off lane was built off Market Street; buses continued to use the former busway on Mount Vernon Street at Central Square. Entrances to the platform <b>are</b> <b>available</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> garage and from Central Square. The new facility opened on January 21, 1992.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{songs in}} the main setlist <b>are</b> <b>available</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> start.

Additionally, the encore song for a particular tier is only made available once its requirements are completed. On the Easy difficulty setting, there are no encores available, but the next tier will be unlocked immediately after completing the required {{songs in the}} previous tier.|$|E

5|$|The Zagros Mountains {{have been}} {{occupied}} {{since at least}} the Lower Palaeolithic, and Neanderthal occupation of the Great Zab basin has been testified at the archaeological site of Shanidar Cave. Historical records for the region <b>are</b> <b>available</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> end of the third millennium BCE onward. In the Neo-Assyrian period, the Great Zab provided water for irrigation for the lands around the capital city of Nimrud. The Battle of the Zab – which ended the Umayyad Caliphate – took place near a tributary of the Great Zab, and the valleys of the river provided shelter for refugees from the Mongol conquest of Iraq. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the Great Zab basin saw frequent uprisings of local Kurdish tribes striving for autonomy.|$|E
5|$|The emergentist {{coalition}} model {{suggests that}} children {{make use of}} multiple cues to successfully attach a novel label to a novel object. The word learning situation may offer an infant combinations of social, perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic cues. While a range of cues <b>are</b> <b>available</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> start of word learning, {{it may be the}} case that not all cues are utilized by the infant when they begin the word learning process. While younger children may only be able to detect a limited number of cues, older, more experienced word learners may be able to make use of a range of cues. For instance, young children seem to focus primarily on perceptual salience, but older children attend to the gaze of caregivers and use the focus of caregivers to direct their word mapping. Therefore, this model argues that principles or cues may be present from the onset of word learning, but the use {{of a wide range of}} cues develops over time.|$|E
5|$|The {{operating}} system is distributed as a Live CD and Live USB (full X11 flavour available) that boots into a complete DragonFly system. It includes the base {{system and a}} complete set of manual pages, and may include source code and useful packages in future versions. The advantage of this is that with a single CD you can install the software onto a computer, use a full set of tools to repair a damaged installation, or demonstrate the capabilities of the system without installing it. Daily snapshots <b>are</b> <b>available</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> master site {{for those who want to}} install the most recent versions of DragonFly without building from source.|$|E

5|$|Adding to the film's $225 {{million budget}} (almost $100 million {{of which were}} spent on the effects), Disney also spent $175 million on {{promoting}} the film. Play Along Toys created a playset of Miraz's castle, a series of 3¾-inch and 7-inch action figures, and roleplaying costumes. Weta Workshop's Collectibles unit also created statues, busts and helmets based on their props for the film, {{and there was also}} a Monopoly edition based on the film. In the UK, Damaris Trust was commissioned to produce resources relating to the film for churches and schools, which <b>are</b> <b>available</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> official UK Narnia website. In June 2008, the Journey into Narnia: Prince Caspian Attraction opened at Disney's Hollywood Studios, featuring a recreation of the Stone Table, behind-the-scenes footage, concept art, storyboards, props and costumes from the film. The tone of the film's marketing focused on the film's action, and unlike The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Disney and Walden did not screen the film for pastors or give Bible-based study guides in North America.|$|E
5|$|One notable {{omission}} was {{the removal}} of the cutscene prior to the Psycho Mantis battle in which he reads the player's memory card and activates the vibration function of the player's controller if a DualShock is being used, as this scene involved the use of PlayStation-specific peripherals. The method for defeating Mantis was also changed from using the second controller to simply using the keyboard (regardless of whether the player was using a game controller or not up to that point). Other omissions include {{the removal of}} the eighth Codec frequency (140.07), which featured written commentaries by the developers, Meryl's alternate sneaking suit outfit, and the mission logs when loading a save file. However, the PC version adds the option to toggle moving and shooting in first-person view mode at any time regardless of difficulty setting, and players can now save their progress at any point without contacting Mei-Ling through the use of quick saves. On the VR training portion, all 300 missions, as well as the photoshoot mode, <b>are</b> <b>available</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> start, although the three unlockable preview trailers from the PlayStation version have been removed.|$|E
