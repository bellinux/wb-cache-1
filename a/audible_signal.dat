25|$|Blind: The thrower or archer wears a blindfold. Generally the {{assistant}} first guides the blindfolded impalement artist into position facing towards the target board. The assistant then stands in place against {{the board and}} gives an <b>audible</b> <b>signal</b> to commence the stunt. The implication is that the impalement artist then has to aim {{on the basis of}} where they remember the target to be. There is a trick behind this stunt and budding impalement artists are warned not to attempt it unless coached by an experienced professional.|$|E
25|$|The ball, {{constructed}} {{of wood and}} covered in zinc, and weighing , is raised just before 1pm, and at precisely 1pm, is dropped from atop the mast. Later, in 1861, the One O'Clock Gun was established at Edinburgh Castle to provide an <b>audible</b> <b>signal</b> when fog obscured the time ball. The time ball was operated for over 150 years, until it was damaged by a storm in 2007. In 2009, {{as part of the}} restoration of the monument, the time ball was removed, and the mechanism repaired. The time ball was brought back into service on 24 September 2009. The mechanism is now operated manually, based on the firing of the One O'Clock Gun.|$|E

500|$|In 2011 the European Commission {{drafted a}} {{guideline}} for Acoustic Vehicle Alerting Systems (AVAS). The {{goal is to}} present recommendations to manufacturers for a system to be installed in vehicles to provide an <b>audible</b> <b>signal</b> to pedestrians and vulnerable road users. This interim guideline is intended to provide guidance until the completion of on-going research activities {{and the development of}} globally harmonized device performance specifications. The guidelines are intended for hybrid electric and pure electric highway-capable vehicles. The guideline recommends that the [...] AVAS shall automatically generate a continuous sound in the minimum range of vehicle speed from start up to approximately [...] and during reversing, if applicable for that vehicle category, and list the types of sounds that are not acceptable. It also states that the AVAS may have a pause switch to stop its operation temporarily.|$|E

2500|$|... "Superheterodyne" [...] is a {{contraction}} of [...] "supersonic heterodyne", where [...] "supersonic" [...] indicates frequencies above {{the range of}} human hearing. The word heterodyne {{is derived from the}} Greek roots hetero- [...] "different", and -dyne [...] "power". In radio applications the term derives from the [...] "heterodyne detector" [...] pioneered by Canadian inventor Reginald Fessenden in 1905, describing his proposed method of producing an <b>audible</b> <b>signal</b> from the Morse code transmissions of the new continuous wave transmitters. With the older spark gap transmitters then in use, the Morse code signal consisted of short bursts of a heavily modulated carrier wave, which could be clearly heard as a series of short chirps or buzzes in the receiver's headphones. However, the signal from a continuous wave transmitter did not have any such inherent modulation and Morse Code from one of those would only be heard as a series of clicks or thumps. Fessenden's idea was to run two Alexanderson alternators, one producing a carrier frequency 3kHz higher than the other. In the receiver's detector the two carriers would beat together to produce a 3kHz tone thus in the headphones the Morse signals would then be heard as a series of 3kHz beeps. For this he coined the term [...] "heterodyne" [...] meaning [...] "generated by a difference" [...] (in frequency).|$|E

5000|$|A train whistle or {{air whistle}} (originally {{referred}} to as a steam trumpet) is an <b>audible</b> <b>signaling</b> device on a steam locomotive used to warn that the train is approaching, and to communicate with rail workers. Modern locomotives primarily use a powerful air horn instead of a whistle as an audible warning device. However, whistle continues to be used by railroaders in the context of <b>audible</b> <b>signaling,</b> such as [...] "whistling off" [...] when a train gets underway.|$|R

2500|$|Morse code {{is a type}} of {{character}} encoding that transmits telegraphic information using rhythm. Morse code uses a standardized sequence of short and long elements to represent the letters, numerals, punctuation, and special characters of a given message. After many years of development, an electrical telegraph came to exclusively refer to a signaling telegram, as an operator makes and breaks an electrical contact with a telegraph key, resulting in an <b>audible</b> <b>signal</b> at the other end produced by a telegraph sounder which is interpreted and transcribed by an operator. The short and long elements are formed by sounds, marks, or pulses, in on off keying and are commonly known as [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] or [...] "dits" [...] and [...] "dahs". In 1832, Alfred Vail in collaboration with Samuel Morse, began the process of co-inventing the Morse code signalling alphabet. After a few minor changes, including the development of International Morse code which is distinct from the original encoding system, American Morse code, Morse code was standardized in 1865 by the International Telegraphy Congress in Paris, France and later made the norm by the International Telecommunication Union. After 160 years of continuous use, international regulations beginning on January 31, 1999, no longer required ships at sea to call for help in an emergency using Morse code or the famous SOS signal.|$|E

The strangeness of his destiny, and the mysteries which appeared to thicken around him, while he seemed alike to be persecuted and protected by secret enemies and friends, arising out of a class of people with whom he had no previous connexion, for some time occupied his thoughts.

And in this comfortable state of oblivion we must leave them until we acquaint the reader with some other circumstances which occurred about the same period.|$|E
