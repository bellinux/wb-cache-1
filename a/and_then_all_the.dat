25|$|Li Xueqin has {{suggested}} that the board was used for divination by matching the day to be divined to the corresponding sexagenary term on the Liubo diagram, and then reading off the corresponding prognostication according to the position of the sexagenary term on the Liubo diagram. However, Lillian Tseng points out that the divination could also be done the other way round, by looking for the desired prognostication (for example an auspicious marriage day), <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> days on the Liubo board that were written on the position corresponding to the term heading the prognostication would match the desired prognostication.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant General Erwin Rommel ordered German {{armoured}} divisions to the Axis fortress {{positions on}} the Egyptian border but failed to find {{the main body of}} the Allied infantry, which had bypassed the fortresses and headed for Tobruk. Rommel had to withdraw from the frontier to Tobruk and achieved some tactical success in costly fighting. The need to preserve his remaining forces from destruction prompted Rommel to withdraw his army to the defensive line at Gazala, west of Tobruk <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way back to El Agheila.

25|$|Operation Crusader (4th Indian, 7th Armoured, 1st South African, 2nd New Zealand and 70th British divisions) between 18 November–30 December 1941. The initial {{plan was}} to destroy the Axis {{armoured}} force before advancing its infantry. 7th Armoured were heavily defeated by the Afrika Korps at Sidi Rezegh. Rommel's subsequent advance of his armoured divisions to the Axis fortress positions on the Egyptian border failed to find {{the main body of}} the Allied infantry, which had bypassed the fortresses and headed for Tobruk, so Rommel had to withdraw his armoured units to support the fighting at Tobruk. Despite achieving some tactical successes at Tobruk, the need to preserve his remaining forces prompted Rommel to withdraw his army to the defensive line at Gazala, west of Tobruk, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way back to El Agheila.|$|E

500|$|While Windows RT {{functions}} {{similarly to}} Windows 8, {{there are still}} some notable differences, primarily involving software and hardware compatibility. Julie Larson-Green, then {{executive vice president of the}} Devices and Studios group at Microsoft, explained that Windows RT was ultimately designed to provide a [...] "closed, turnkey" [...] user experience, [...] "where it doesn't have all the flexibility of Windows, but it has the power of Office <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> new style applications. So you could give it to your kid and he's not going to load it up with a bunch of toolbars accidentally out of Internet Explorer and then come to you later and say, 'why am I getting all these pop-ups?'

500|$|A {{typical power}} divider {{is shown in}} figure 13. [...] Ideally, input power would be divided equally between the output ports. [...] Dividers are made up of {{multiple}} couplers and, like couplers, may be reversed and used as multiplexers. [...] The drawback is that for a four channel multiplexer, the output consists of only 1/4 the power from each, and is relatively inefficient. [...] The {{reason for this is that}} at each combiner half the input power goes to port 4 and is dissipated in the termination load. [...] If the two inputs were coherent the phases could be so arranged that cancellation occurred at port 4 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> power would go to port 1. [...] However, multiplexer inputs are usually from entirely independent sources and therefore not coherent. [...] Lossless multiplexing can only be done with filter networks.Naval Air Warfare Center, pp.6.4.4, 6.4.5 ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of Series 5, set {{three months after the}} birth, Rachel appears overprotective of Matthew; she refuses to let Adam hold him and never lets him out of her sight. After Adam abruptly leaves Matthew's naming ceremony, feeling unable to love his child because he is coming between him and his wife, Rachel reveals that the baby fell off the kitchen table when she left him unattended for a matter of seconds. Baxendale said of the story, [...] "Rachel's take on motherhood is quite real in my experience because she's had such trouble conceiving for a start <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> problems with the birth [...] She becomes obsessed with the baby and excludes Adam from everything. They have to work hard to resolve their differences and there is a big transition. I can see why she behaves the way she does—you do become over-protective with a baby. It's amazing what your body does to you and the instincts that suddenly take over. Being a mum myself, I have got real empathy with Rachel."
