5|$|Milk {{abruptly}} {{stopped working}} as an insurance <b>actuary</b> and became {{a researcher at the}} Wall Street firm Bache & Company. He was frequently promoted despite his tendency to offend the older members of the firm by ignoring their advice and flaunting his success. Although he was skilled at his job, co-workers sensed that Milk's heart was not in his work. He started a romantic relationship with Jack Galen McKinley, and recruited him to work on conservative Republican Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign. Their relationship was troubled. When McKinley first began his relationship with Milk in late 1964, he was 16 years old. He was prone to depression and sometimes threatened to commit suicide if Milk did not show him enough attention. To make a point to McKinley, Milk took him to the hospital where Milk's ex-lover, Joe Campbell, was himself recuperating from a suicide attempt, after his lover Billy Sipple left him. Milk had remained friendly with Campbell, who had entered the avant-garde art scene in Greenwich Village, but Milk did not understand why Campbell's despondency was sufficient cause to consider suicide as an option.|$|E

25|$|Six {{months before}} his murder, Bermúdez Zacarías issued a {{complaint}} to the CJF for several irregularities he found in his job when he joined as an appeals judge in 2016. According to Bermúdez Zacarías' findings, Mayumi Guadalupe Sánchez Torres, the wife of his predecessor Jorge Arturo Porras Gutiérrez, was visiting several inmates at Altiplano prison without justification. Her job was to legally notify inmates of their cases in person, but Bermúdez Zacarías also discovered that she was abusing this right and visiting other inmates who were not in their itinerary. Sánchez Torres was an <b>actuary</b> at the appeals court and was accompanied by another <b>actuary,</b> Ana Lilia Coyote Colín, during her prison visits. They were taken to prison by Alejandro Coyote Colín, {{who served as the}} driver. Bermúdez Zacarías discovered that the driver also spoke with the inmates and posed as an <b>actuary.</b> This complaint led the CJF to investigate and suspend Sánchez Torres, Ana Lilia, and two other people. Investigators are considering this line of investigation as a possible motive for his murder.|$|E
