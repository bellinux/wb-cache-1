5|$|Red maple is a {{good choice}} of a tree for urban areas when there is ample room for its root system. Forming an {{association}} with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi can help A. rubrum grow along city streets. It is more tolerant of pollution and road salt than Sugar Maples, although the tree's fall foliage is not as vibrant in this environment. Like several other maples, its low root system can be invasive <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> a poor choice for plantings near paving. It attracts squirrels, who eat its buds in the early spring, although squirrels prefer the larger buds of the silver maple.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{all signs}} have rounded corners. This is partly for {{aesthetic}} reasons. It is also safer for anyone coming {{into contact with}} a sign, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> the sign more durable, as rain {{is less likely to}} corrode the corners.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{being called}} the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the stadium has been and {{continues}} to be used much more often for Australian rules football. Spectator numbers for football are larger than for any other sport in Australia, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> more money for the MCG {{than any of the other}} sports played there.|$|E
60|$|Heat at {{the equator}} warms the sea-water, <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> light; cold at the poles chills <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> heavy. Hot water, being light, rises; cold water, being heavy, sinks.|$|R

25|$|Early {{resistors}} {{were made}} in more or less arbitrary round numbers; a series might have 100, 125, 150, 200, 300, etc. Resistors as manufactured are subject to a certain percentage tolerance, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> sense to manufacture values that correlate with the tolerance, so that the actual value of a resistor overlaps slightly with its neighbors. Wider spacing leaves gaps; narrower spacing increases manufacturing and inventory costs to provide resistors that {{are more or less}} interchangeable.|$|E
25|$|All plywoods bind resin {{and wood}} fibre sheets (cellulose cells are long, strong and thin) {{to form a}} {{composite}} material. This alternation of the grain is called cross-graining and has several important benefits: it reduces the tendency of wood to split when nailed in at the edges; it reduces expansion and shrinkage, providing improved dimensional stability; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> {{the strength of the}} panel consistent across all directions. There is usually an odd number of plies, so that the sheet is balanced—this reduces warping. Because plywood is bonded with grains running against one another and with an odd number of composite parts, {{it is very hard to}} bend it perpendicular to the grain direction of the surface ply.|$|E
25|$|The rest of {{the costs}} of these {{highways}} are borne by general fund receipts, bond issues, designated property taxes, and other taxes. The federal contribution comes overwhelmingly from motor vehicle and fuel taxes (93.5percent in 2007), <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> up about 60percent of the contributions by the states. However, any local government contributions are overwhelmingly from sources besides user fees. The portion of the user fees spent on highways themselves covers about 57percent of their costs, with about one-sixth of the user fees being sent to other programs, including the mass transit systems in large cities. Some large sections of Interstate Highways that were planned or constructed before 1956 are still operated as toll roads. Others have had their construction bonds paid off and they have become toll-free, such as in Connecticut (I‑95), Maryland (I‑95), Virginia (I‑95), and Kentucky (I‑65).|$|E

25|$|As a {{consequence}} of bipedalism, human females have narrower birth canals. The construction of the human pelvis differs from other primates, as do the toes. A trade-off for these advantages of the modern human pelvis is that childbirth is more difficult and dangerous than in most mammals, especially given the larger head size of human babies compared to other primates. This means that human babies must turn around as they pass through the birth canal, which other primates do not do, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> humans the only species where females usually require help from their conspecifics (other {{members of their own}} species) to reduce the risks of birthing. As a partial evolutionary solution, human fetuses are born less developed and more vulnerable. Chimpanzee babies are cognitively more developed than human babies until the age of six months, when the rapid development of human brains surpasses chimpanzees. Another difference between women and chimpanzee females is that women go through the menopause and become unfertile decades before the end of their lives. All species of non-human apes are capable of giving birth until death. Menopause probably developed as it has provided an evolutionary advantage (more caring time) to young relatives.|$|E
500|$|Nader {{lost the}} role again in February 2001 {{as a result}} of the actor getting arrested for {{allegedly}} selling cocaine to an undercover police officer. All My Children released an official statement saying, [...] "If Mr. Nader gets the help that he needs and addresses his problem, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> sense for the show, we would be prepared to speak with Michael in the future."

One of the designs was also projected onto the stage after the band's show {{on the same day}} at the Vogue Theatre in Vancouver, increasing the amount of speculation regarding that the band may be implying a planned breakup in the year 2018. Frontman Lacey confirmed of the speculation in between songs during a set in Salt Lake City, Utah in June. He stated [...] "We’re done. Oh yeah, we’re done, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> nights like this all the more special so thanks for being here." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Titanium" [...] {{was written}} by Sia, David Guetta, Giorgio Tuinfort and Afrojack. Production was also handled by Guetta, Tuinfort and Afrojack. After {{discovering}} Sia's music online, Guetta picked her to appear on his fifth studio album, Nothing but the Beat. Guetta told an insider from Los Angeles, [...] "I was totally amazed by Sia...This has made me more curious to study her music more because I was really impressed. I have the biggest people on the album {{and she has a}} different profile, more like an indie kind of artist <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> her song even more special, it makes it stand out I think." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{incorporates}} rocksteady music, as {{the lyrics}} tackle her {{dealing with the}} betrayal of her boyfriend, while enjoying his misery. Most contemporary critics complimented the song, noticing the confidence it hides and the carnival-esque, yet melancholy, theme. On the other hand, some considered it {{was not one of}} the album's best tracks <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> the singer a [...] "theoretical pop princess". The single peaked inside the top 40 of the charts of some European countries and Australia, while staying on the summit of the UK Singles Chart for two consecutive weeks and ended the year as the country's 11th most successful song. It is also charted on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, where it was certified gold.|$|E
500|$|According to Brandee J. Tecson of MTV News, [...] "Unfaithful" [...] is a [...] "bittersweet ballad" [...] {{that shows}} a new side to Rihanna.

He knows, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> him feel so bad." [...] She continued, [...] "We always put it out there that guys cheat, and finally someone put it in perspective: girls cheat too." [...] In another interview for Newsday, she said that [...] "Unfaithful" [...] was [...] "birthed out of a relationship she outgrew when she was fourteen".

500|$|Michael Jackson wrote [...] "Billie Jean" [...] {{with his}} female fans in mind, and later stated {{that when he}} wrote the song, {{he knew it would}} be a success: [...] "A {{musician}} knows hit material. Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> you feel good. That's how I felt about 'Billie Jean'. I {{knew it was going to}} be big when I was writing it." [...] The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: [...] "The kid probably saved our lives." ...|$|E

500|$|Later reviews {{were also}} complimentary. VanDerWerff gave the episode an [...] "A" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "a {{good example of the}} show heading in a {{different}} direction but still largely feeling like the same show." [...] He praised the episode for being [...] "fun [...] creepy". VanDerWerff also praised the final scene, noting that [...] "rare that Mulder and Scully completely get played, but they do here, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> the episode an even better sick joke." [...] Ultimately, he praised the [...] "sick sense of humor", the [...] "outright left turns into demented darkness", and [...] "the horrifying visuals".

500|$|Most of the melodies on Get to Heaven {{originated}} from Robertshaw's guitar, though he recalled to Rich Chamberlain of MusicRadar that Higgs would occasionally approach {{the rest of}} the group with [...] "an insane laptop creation" [...] which would have to be translated to work as a group. Several tracks feature complex guitar solos, as noted by Chamberlain; one such solo, featured on the title track [...] "Get to Heaven", was originally recorded in a hotel room. Another, on the single [...] "Spring / Sun / Winter / Dread", makes heavy use of an MWFX Judder pedal. Robertshaw told Chamberlain that [...] " [...] is a bit of a signature for the new record... You can do totally unrealistic things with it <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> you sound like Steve Vai on crack." ...|$|E
500|$|Abbey Road is a rock {{album that}} {{incorporates}} genres such as blues, pop, and progressive rock, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> prominent {{use of the}} Moog synthesizer and the Leslie speaker. Side two contains a medley of song fragments edited {{together to form a}} single piece. The album was recorded amid a more enjoyable atmosphere than the Get Back/Let It Be sessions earlier in the year, but there were still frequent disagreements within the band, particularly over Paul McCartney's song [...] "Maxwell's Silver Hammer". John Lennon had privately left the group by the time the album was released and McCartney publicly quit the following year. A 16-minute medley of several short songs comprise the majority of side two, closing with the lyric [...] "and in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make".|$|E
