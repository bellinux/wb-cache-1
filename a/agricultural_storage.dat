40|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} the {{basic understanding of}} desiccant air-conditioning (AC) system for <b>storage</b> of <b>agricultural</b> products of Pakistan. In this regard, the study provides the ideal growth zones for various agricultural products. The desiccant air-conditioning applicability has been determined for three different climatic conditions (A, B, C) {{in order to achieve}} the sensible and latent load of AC for the studied products. It is determined that desiccant wheel perform higher dehumidification under climatic condition ‘A’because of the maximum ambient air relative humidity. Consequently, higher heat energy is required in climatic condition ‘A’ to regenerate the desiccant wheel. It has been concluded that the desiccant AC system can be effectively used for <b>agricultural</b> product <b>storage</b> in many regions of Pakistan...|$|R
50|$|Located in a {{slightly}} elevated location, the 1st century Roma era rural village dominated the space, with a southern view of the landscape until Beja. It was likely the centre of a small community, with the property-owner's residence, spaces for <b>agricultural</b> <b>storage,</b> warehousing and equipment to work the land {{in the production of}} wine and olive oil. During this period, and in successive years (until the late 4th century) the main house was progressively expanded, during two great projects. The first, originating in the 2nd century, was initially a timid expansion of the residence (pars urbana). The second, {{in the middle of the}} 4th century, marked a complete schism with the older architectural style, with a principal façade oriented around several interior courtyards open to the exterior, along a linear line. It is these modifications that, today, remain conserved at the archaeological site. These latter changes also reflect a grandiose style and opulance from an epoch that came to an end.|$|E
