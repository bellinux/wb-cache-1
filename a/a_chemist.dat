5|$|There is no widely agreed criterion-based {{definition}} of a heavy metal. Different meanings may {{be attached to the}} term, depending on the context. In metallurgy, for example, a heavy metal may be defined on the basis of density, whereas in physics the distinguishing criterion might be atomic number, and <b>a</b> <b>chemist</b> would likely be more concerned with chemical behaviour.|$|E

He studied part-time for a bachelor's degree in civil engineering at the University of Melbourne, concurrently serving approximately two years in the militia with various units including the 39thBattalion, 3rdDivision Artillery Survey Unit, and Melbourne University Regiment. He also developed a love of fast cars, joining a racing team and placing third in the 1930 Australian Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, Piccadilly {{became known}} {{as a place to}} acquire heroin. Jazz trumpeter Dizzy Reece {{recalled}} people queuing outside Piccadilly's branch of Boots for heroin pills in the late 1940s. By the 1960s, the street and surrounding area were notorious as the centre of London's illegal drug trade, where heroin and cocaine could be purchased on the black market from unscrupulous chemists. By 1982, up to 20 people could be seen queueing at <b>a</b> <b>chemist</b> dealing in illegal drugs in nearby Shaftesbury Avenue.|$|E

5|$|Frank Spedding's Ames Project had {{developed}} the Ames process, {{a method of}} producing uranium metal on an industrial scale, but Cyril Stanley Smith, the CM Division's associate leader in charge of metallurgy, was concerned about using it with highly enriched uranium due to the danger of forming a critical mass. Highly enriched uranium was also far more valuable than natural uranium, {{and he wanted to}} avoid the loss of even a milligram. He recruited Richard D. Baker, <b>a</b> <b>chemist</b> who had worked with Spedding, and together they adapted the Ames Process for use at the Los Alamos laboratory. In February Baker and his group made twenty 360 gram reductions and twenty-seven 500 gram reductions with highly enriched uranium tetrafluoride.|$|E
5|$|Frank, {{the eldest}} of four children, was raised in an Italian-American {{household}} where Italian was often spoken by his grandparents. The family moved often because his father, <b>a</b> <b>chemist</b> and mathematician, worked in the defense industry. After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to Maryland, where Zappa's father worked at the Edgewood Arsenal chemical warfare facility of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored mustard gas, gas masks were kept in the home {{in case of an}} accident. This {{had a profound effect on}} Zappa, and references to germs, germ warfare and the defense industry occur throughout his work.|$|E
5|$|Gerty Theresa Radnitz {{was born}} into a Jewish family in Prague in 1896. Her father, Otto Radnitz, was <b>a</b> <b>chemist</b> who became manager of sugar {{refineries}} after inventing a successful method for refining sugar. Her mother, Martha, a friend of Franz Kafka, was a culturally sophisticated woman. Gerty was tutored at home before enrolling in a Lyceum for girls, and at the age of 16 she decided {{she wanted to be a}} medical doctor. Pursuing the study of science, Gerty learned that she lacked the prerequisites in Latin, physics, chemistry, and mathematics. Over the course of a year, she managed to study the equivalent of eight years of Latin, five years of science, and five years of math.|$|E

His brother Bill also played baseball for Virginia. During the off-season, umpire Cy Rigler worked as an assistant coach for the University. He recognized Rixey's talent and tried to sign him to the Philadelphia Phillies. Rixey originally declined, saying he wanted to be <b>a</b> <b>chemist,</b> but Rigler insisted, even offering a substantial portion of the bonus he received for signing a player. With his family in financial trouble, Rixey accepted the deal. The National League, upon hearing of the deal, created a rule that prohibits umpires from signing players. Neither Rixey nor Rigler received any signing bonus.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, Elizabeth Lummis {{published}} {{her first}} book, entitled Poems, Translated and Original, which included her tragedy, Teresa Contarini, {{based on the}} history of Venice, that was successfully performed in New York and other cities. Around this time she married William Henry Ellet (1806–1859), <b>a</b> <b>chemist</b> from New York City. He graduated from Columbia College in New York and earned a gold medal for a dissertation on the compounds of cyanogen. The couple moved to Columbia, South Carolina, when he was made professor of chemistry, mineralogy and geology at South Carolina College in 1836. He also discovered a new and inexpensive method of preparing guncotton, for which the state of South Carolina presented him a service of silver plate.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{initially}} {{assumed that}} the arsenic used to poison the victims had come from rat poison, but when common adulterants used in rat poison {{failed to show up}} in autopsies, they were forced {{to come up with a}} new theory. It was unlikely that the illiterate sisters would have been able to acquire arsenic through the usual method of visiting <b>a</b> <b>chemist,</b> a route more open to doctors than spinsters. Eventually it was discovered that common flypaper at the time contained arsenic, and that by soaking the flypaper in water, a solution substantially identical – including the same adulterants – to that found in a bottle at the Higgins residence could be obtained.|$|E

5|$|Jacob is {{approached}} by a distressed Michael Newman, the man who treated his wound in a medevac helicopter in Vietnam and who dragged him away from Paul’s burning car. Newman tells a story of having been <b>a</b> <b>chemist</b> with the Army’s chemical warfare division in Saigon. He designed “the Ladder”, a drug that massively increased aggression, taking people straight to their most primal urges. To test its effectiveness, a dose was secretly given to Jacob’s unit – causing them to turn on {{each other in a}} homicidal frenzy. The revelation causes Jacob to fully remember the moment he was attacked in Vietnam, where it is revealed that a fellow American soldier bayoneted him.|$|E

5|$|Lilly became {{interested}} in chemicals as a teen. In 1854, while {{on a trip to}} visit his aunt and uncle in Lafayette, Indiana, the sixteen-year-old Lilly visited Henry Lawrence's Good Samaritan Drug Store, a local apothecary shop, where he watched Lawrence prepare pharmaceutical drugs. Lilly completed a four-year apprenticeship with Lawrence to become <b>a</b> <b>chemist</b> and pharmacist. In addition to learning to mix chemicals, Lawrence taught Lilly how to manage funds and operate a business. In 1858, after earning a certificate of proficiency from his apprenticeship, Lilly left the Good Samaritan to work for Israel Spencer and Sons, a wholesale and retail druggist in Lafayette, before moving to Indianapolis to take a position at the Perkins and Coons Pharmacy.|$|E

5|$|Nadia Kaabi-Linke {{was born}} in Tunis in 1978. She is of Russian-Ukrainian and Tunisian heritage, her father a sports {{academic}} and her mother <b>a</b> <b>chemist.</b> Kaabi-Linke was raised between Kiev and Tunis. She moved to Dubai when she was 12 when her father took a job there. Kaabi-Linke recalled the move as difficult, particularly in losing the opportunity to study modern dance. With her mother's encouragement, Kaabi-Linke began to draw. Later she studied painting at the Tunis Institute of Fine Arts, graduated in 1999, and received her Ph.D. from the Sorbonne in 2008 in aesthetics and the philosophy of art. While in France, she met her German husband, Timo, who would later curate many of Kaabi-Linke's shows.|$|E
