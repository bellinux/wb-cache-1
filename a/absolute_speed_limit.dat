50|$|Outside of {{built up}} areas, a prima facie speed limit applied. In New South Wales and Victoria, the prima facie speed limit was 50 {{miles per hour}} (80 km/h in New South Wales after metrication). In the 1970s however, most state prima facie speed limits were {{gradually}} replaced by absolute limits. An <b>absolute</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> of 70 mph was introduced to Victoria in 1971, as a trial. This was subsequently reduced to 60 mph in late 1973. South Australia introduced an <b>absolute</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> of 60 mph in 1974.|$|E

5000|$|A common {{usage of}} the phrase {{is the concept of}} a [...] "prima facie speed limit", which has been used in Australia and the United States. A prima facie <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> is a default <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> that applies when no other {{specific}} <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> is posted, and which may be exceeded by a driver. However, if the driver is detected and cited by police for exceeding the limit, the onus of proof is on the driver to show that the speed at which the driver was travelling was safe under the circumstances. In most jurisdictions, this type of <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> has been replaced by <b>absolute</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|R

50|$|With the {{exception}} of wartime, New Mexico had no default numeric speed limit until the early 1950s. Prior to the national 55 mph limit in 1974, the speed limit on rural Interstates was 75 miles per hour {{during the day and}} 70 mph at night. Primary highways in open areas had daytime speed limits of 70 mph and nighttime ones of 60 mph. Secondary highways in open areas had daytime speed limits of 60 mph and nighttime ones of 50 mph. Before the end of federal speed controls, the maximum speed limit was 65 mph on Interstate routes and 55 mph elsewhere. In May 1996 legislation enacted by Governor Gary Johnson raised the <b>absolute</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> in New Mexico to 75 mph. Signs are posted on {{the vast majority of the}} mileage of Interstate routes to that effect. The default speed limit for any road where no speed limit is posted is 55 mph.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two other}} {{statutory}} <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> in New Mexico that are often altered, especially on urban arterials or even city or countywide: thirty miles per hour in a [...] "business or residence district" [...] and fifteen miles per hour near schools at certain times.

Although {{there are no signs}} to make drivers aware of the altered limit, the limit is signed on most roads where it applies. Los Alamos County alters the urban default and <b>absolute</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> to twenty five miles per hour and 50 mph respectively, but posts signs at county lines.|$|R
500|$|Enforcement and {{compliance}} with seat belt laws varies by state. (Massachusetts, {{which had the}} lowest death rate per 100 million miles traveled in 2015, was among the states with the lowest use of seat belts.) Some states require motorcycle helmets while others do not. <b>Speed</b> <b>limits,</b> traffic density, topography, climate and many other factors affect the divergent accident rates by state. <b>Speed</b> <b>limits</b> in Texas, Utah, and Rhode Island are prima facie rather than absolute. This allows motorists in those states to defend against a speeding charge {{if it can be}} proven that the speed was reasonable and prudent. In good driving conditions, many drivers in prima facie states presume (usually correctly) that police will allow some tolerance in enforcement. Even in states with <b>absolute</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limits,</b> enforcement and penalties vary from one state to another. For these and other reasons, state-to-state comparisons are difficult. There are many studies examining increases in Interstate <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> from 55mph to 65, 70 and 75mph.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the views on space and time of the Russian polymath Pavel Florensky (1882 - 1937). After a brief account of his life, I study Florensky’s conception of time in The Meaning of Idealism (1914), where he first confronts Einstein’s theory of special relativity, comparing it to Plato’s metaphor of the Cave and Goethe’s myth of the Mothers. Later, in his Analysis of spatiality and time, Florensky speaks of a person’s biography as a four-dimensional unity, in which the temporal coordinate is examined in sections. In On the Imaginaries in Geometry (1922), Florensky argues that {{the speed of light}} is not, as in Relativity, an <b>absolute</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> in the universe. When bodies approach and then surpass the speed of light, they are transformed into unextended, eternal Platonic forms. Beyond this point, time runs in reverse, effects precede their causes, and efficient causality is transformed into final or teleological causality, a concept on which Florensky elaborates in his Iconostasis. Florensky thus transformed the findings of Einsteinian relativity in order to make room for Plato’s intelligible Ideas, the Aristotelian distinction between a changing realm of earth and the immutable realm of the heavens, and the notion of teleology or final causation. His notion that man can approximate God’s vision of past, present and future all at once, as if from above, is reminiscent of Boethius’ ideas...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{a model of}} gravity where gravitational pull is created by accelerating flow of space which is absorbed by mass. Proposed model of gravity is used to define {{the size of a}} zone of gravitational influence of mass and to explain the value of the rest mass energy and the phenomenon of time dilation. This model suggests that the gravitational influence of mass squeezes space cells and accelerates them towards the mass until a certain critical speed is reached at which the space cells collapse. The critical speed of the space cells is the mass’s space absorption speed which sets an <b>absolute</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> for a movement in space which can’t be exceeded by any object. The total energy of mass is equal to the sum of its gravitational and kinetic energies. Stationary object with uniform space absorption from all directions has the highest gravitational energy for its mass but no kinetic energy. When an object is moving with the speed of light it completely loses its gravitational influence but gains the highest possible kinetic energy. The last case defines the value of the total energy of mass as equal to its highest kinetic energy. Time for the particle of matter is measured in the acts of space cells absorption. Duration of the quantum of time {{is a function of the}} size of the space cells when they reach a particle of matter. The gravitational influence of any mass is weakening when it’s moving in space. Lower gravity means an increasing size of the space cells on the surface of the matter and therefore slower time for the moving mass...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} formulas {{for determining}} the critical depths of cut and asymptotic spindle speed for stable micro milling processes with process damping. The asymptotic spindle speed of a theoretically infinite stable depth of cut is shown to be proportional to the modal natural frequency, radial ploughing constant and radial immersion angle, but inversely proportional to the shearing related cutting constants and tool diameter. These formulas enable identifying the asymptotic <b>speed,</b> <b>absolute</b> stability <b>limit,</b> and in-process radial ploughing constant from experimental stability limits without requiring modal parameters. The presented model is validated by comparison with prior works and verified by experiments...|$|R
40|$|Several {{scholars}} have defined {{the urgent need}} for more research to identify the precise relationship between speed and crash involvement more fully. In this paper, we present the first results of an exploratory study carried out in the Brabant Southeast police region in the Netherlands. Hourly speed measurement data over a period of two years were collected from loop detectors on the municipal and provincial road network and were related to crashes. Different aspects of traffic intensity, speed and their impact on crashes were studied, including <b>absolute</b> <b>speed,</b> speed variation and the proportion of excessive speeders, both for vehicles under and over 5. 2 meters long. The study also discusses a number of methodological aspects associated with this kind of analysis. The results show that although <b>absolute</b> <b>speed</b> plays a more important role on roads where <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> are low, it is the variation in speed that correlates more with crashes when <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> are higher. Given the limited study area, the results of this work cannot be generalized without risk. However, they offer interesting insights that deserve further investigation in a nationwide cross-sectional study. Brijs, Wets, Krimpenfort, Offermans 1 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{experimental}} testing of end point position controllers {{for a very}} flexible one link lightweight manipulator are summarized. The latest upgraded version of the experimental set up, and the basic differences between conventional joint angle feedback and end point position feedback are described. A general procedure for application of modern control methods to the problem is outlined. The relationship between weighting parameters and the bandwidth and control stiffness of the resulting end point position closed loop system is shown. It is found that joint rate angle feedback {{in addition to the}} primary end point position sensor is essential for adequate disturbance rejection capability of the closed loop system. The use of a low order multivariable compensator design computer code; called Sandy is documented. A {{solution to the problem of}} control mode switching between position sensor sets is outlined. The proof of concept for endpoint position feedback for a one link flexible manipulator was demonstrated. The bandwidth obtained with the experimental end point position controller is about twice as fast as the beam's first natural cantilevered frequency, and comes within a factor of four of the <b>absolute</b> physical <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> imposed by the wave propagation time of the beam...|$|R
