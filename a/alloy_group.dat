IM-NS was implanted into the right tibia (24 -week investigation period; nails/screws diameter: 9 mm/ 3. 5 mm, length: 130 mm/ 15 - 40 mm) of 10 adult sheep (LAE 442, stainless steel, n= 5 each group). Clinical and radiographic examinations, in vivo computed tomography (CT), ex vivo micro-computed tomography (muCT), mechanical and histological examinations and element analyses of alloying elements in inner organs were performed. The mechanical examinations (four-point bending) revealed a significant decrease of LAE 442 implant stiffness, force at 0. 2 % offset yield point and maximum force. Periosteal (new bone formation) and endosteal (bone decline) located bone alterations occurred in both groups (LAE 442 alloy more pronounced). Moderate gas formation was observed within the LAE 442 <b>alloy</b> <b>group.</b> The CT-measured implant volume decreased slightly (not significant). Histologically a predominantly direct bone-to-implant interface existed within the LAE 442 <b>alloy</b> <b>group.</b> Formation of a fibrous tissue capsule around the nail occurred in the steel group. Minor inflammatory infiltration was observed in the LAE 442 <b>alloy</b> <b>group.</b> Significantly increased quantities of rare earth elements were detected in the LAE 442 <b>alloy</b> <b>group.</b> muCT examination showed the beginning of corrosion in dependence of the surrounding tissue.

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Major {{connectors}} {{are used}} with removable partial dentures to connect all other parts to the denture. The use of titanium to fabricate removable partial dentures has recently increased. Objective: This study aimed {{to assess the}} effect of the titanium alloy and chrome cobalt to fabricate connectors of removable partial dentures on tooth mobility, bone loss and tissue reaction. Materials and methods: A non-randomized clinical-controlled trial was conducted at the Dental Clinic, Faculty of Dentistry at Al-Azhar University-Assiut Branch, from January 2013 to January 2015. Eighty patients were classified into two groups, which were provided with removable partial dentures comprising titanium alloy and chrome cobalt connectors respectively. Patients’ demographic and clinical data (tooth mobility, bone loss and tissue reaction) were evaluated via the questionnaires, and clinical observations by qualified medical dentists with panoramic X-rays. Both groups were examined at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Results: Tooth mobility, in all directions, ranged between 0 mm at enrollment and 0. 10 mm in the titanium <b>alloy</b> <b>group</b> and ranged from 0 mm to 0. 20 mm in the chrome cobalt group. The difference in tooth mobility between the two groups {{at the end of the}} study was statistically significant (p= 0. 04). The bone loss ranged from 0 mm at enrollment and 0. 05 mm in the titanium <b>alloy</b> <b>group</b> and ranged from 0. 04 mm to 0. 15 mm in the chrome cobalt group. The difference in bone loss between the two groups was statistically significant (p= 0. 01). The tissue reaction in the titanium <b>alloy</b> <b>group</b> ranged from 0 to 0. 02, and it ranged from 0 to 0. 16 in the chrome cobalt group. The difference in tissue reaction was statistically significant (p= 0. 02).

40|$|Objectives. This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the vertical discrepancy of implant-supported crown structures constructed with vacuum-casting and Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) technologies, and luted with different cement types. Study D esign. Crown copings were fabricated using: (1) direct metal laser sintered Co-Cr (LS); (2) vacuum-cast Co-Cr (CC); and (3) vacuum-cast Ti (CT). Frameworks were luted onto machined implant abutments under constant seating pressure. Each <b>alloy</b> <b>group</b> was randomly divided into 5 subgroups (n = 10 each) according to the cement system utilized: Subgroup 1 (KC) used resin-modified glass-ionomer Ketac Cem Plus; Subgroup 2 (PF) used Panavia F 2. 0 dual-cure resin cement; Subgroup 3 (RXU) used RelyX Unicem 2 Automix self-adhesive dual-cure resin cement; Subgroup 4 (PIC) used acrylic/urethane-based temporary Premier Implant Cement; and Subgroup 5 (DT) used acrylic/urethane-based temporary DentoTemp cement. Vertical misfit was measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Two-way ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls tests were run to investigate the effect of alloy/fabrication technique, and cement type on vertical misfit. The statistical significance was set at ? = 0. 05. Results. The alloy/manufacturing technique and the luting cement affected the vertical discrepancy (p < 0. 001). For each cement type, LS samples exhibited the best fit (p < 0. 01) whereas CC and CT frames were statistically similar. Within each <b>alloy</b> <b>group,</b> PF and RXU provided comparably greater discrepancies than KC, PIC, and DT, which showed no differences. Conclusions. Laser sintering may be an alternative to vacuum-casting of base metals to obtain passive-fitting implant-supported crown copings.

In this study, we developed a dynamic model of aluminum in the global vehicle stock (distinguishing 5 car segments, 14 components, and 7 <b>alloy</b> <b>groups).</b> The forecasts made up to the year 2050 for the demand for vehicle components and <b>alloy</b> <b>groups,</b> for the scrap supply from discarded vehicles, and for the effects of different ELV management options. Furthermore, we used a source-sink diagram to identify alloys that could potentially serve as alternative sinks for the growing scrap supply. Dismantling the relevant components could remove up to two-thirds of the aluminum from the ELV stream. However, the use of these components for alloy-specific recycling is currently limited because of the complex composition of components (mixed material design and applied joining techniques), as well as provisions that practically prevent the production of safety-relevant cast parts from scrap. In addition, dismantling is more difficult for components that are currently penetrating rapidly. Therefore, advanced alloy sorting seems to be a crucial step that needs to be developed over the coming years to avoid a future scrap surplus and prevent negative energy use and emission consequences.

Titanium alloy (Ti- 5 AL- 5 Mo- 5 V- 3 CR) is now used {{for the production of}} landing gear. There are many goals in this paper. First, the physical and mechanical properties of the material will be presented. Secondly, we show the relationship between material properties and machinability. Third, the Ti 5553 will be compared to Ti 64. The Ti 64 is a+b <b>alloy</b> <b>group</b> and Ti 5553 is a metastable beta but we have chosen to compare these two materials. Ti 64 is the most popular of titanium alloys and many of works were been made on its machining. After, we have cited the Ti 5553 properties and detailed the behaviour laws. They are used in different ways, with or without thermal softening effect or without dynamic terms. We have to define the best model to use in cutting force model. Differents models are compared for two materials (steel and titanium alloy). To define the model, two methods exist that we have compared. The first is based on machining test however the second on Hopkinson bar test. These methods allow us to obtain different ranges of strain rate, strain and temperature. This comparison will show the importance of a good range of strain rate, strain and temperature for behaviour law, especially in titanium machining...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Base metals {{are being}} {{increasingly}} used in casting procedures in dentistry. Since recasting these alloys in laboratory might have {{negative effects on}} marginal fitness, it seems necessary to study the effect of recasting procedures more carefully. The goal {{of this study was}} to study the effect of recasting base metals on vertical marginal fitness of crowns with different marginal configurations with different percentages of alloys. Material and Methods: In this study, two dies made up of brass with dimensions of prepared premolars and marginal configurations of shoulder bevel 450 and shoulder 1350 were prepared by CNC machine. Total of 30 copings were waxed and cast, 15 copings for each die. Copings were further subdivided in to three groups A, B and C. Group A consisted of 100 % new <b>alloy,</b> <b>group</b> B consisted of combination of 50 % new alloy and 50 % old <b>alloy,</b> <b>group</b> C consisted of 100 % recast alloy. After copings were seated, vertical distance from margin of the restoration to margin of the die was measured by metric microscope with Moticam camera at four points of buccal, lingual, mesial and distal. Data were analyzed by two- and one-way ANOVA and t- test. Results: Group A 1 (135 º shoulder finishing line cast with 100 % new alloy) : 156. 11 micron. Group A 2 (45 º shoulder bevel finishing line cast with 100 % new alloy) : 99. 74 micron. Group B 1 (135 º shoulder finishing line cast with 50 % new alloy and 50 % recast alloy) : 273. 38 micron. Group B 2 (45 º shoulder bevel finishing line cast with 50 % new alloy and 50 % recast alloy) : 123. 07 micron. Group C 1 (135 º shoulder finishing line cast with 100 % recast alloy) : 369. 40 micron. Group C 2 (45 º shoulder bevel finishing line cast with 100 % recast alloy) : 106. 97 micron. There were statistical differences between groups A, B and C in vertical gap when three different percentages of alloys (100 % new with average gap of 127. 93 micron, 50 % new+ 50 % recast with average gap of 198. 22 micron, 100 % recast with average gap of 238. 18 micron) were used (p value = 0. 036). There were statistical differences in mean vertical gap distance between different preparations (shoulder bevel 45 º, shoulder 135 º) within each group (100 % new, 50 % new + 50 % recast, 100 % recast). Discussion: When three different percentages of alloys were used (100 % new alloy, 50 % new + 50 % old, 100 % old), 100 % new alloy showed the least mean vertical gap compared to other two groups. In shoulder 135 º there were statically differences between group A and C only and in shoulder bevel preparation there were no statically differences between groups A, B and C. In group C (100 % recast) there were significant differences between two preparations (shoulder bevel 45 º and shoulder 135 º).

40|$|The {{impact of}} copper content on the Sn-Ag-y%Cu (Ag = {{constant}} = 3. 5; y = 0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0) interconnects {{was investigated in}} this study. The copper content and solid-liquid (S-L) reactions were used as inputs, and the outputs were the interfacial microstructure evolution and joint macro-performance. Surface microetching microscopy, cross-section microscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray analysis, shear test, and differential scan-ning calorimetry {{were used in the}} studies. It was discovered that as-soldered Sn-Ag-y%Cu interconnects could have different interfacial microstructures depending on copper content; no Ag 3 Sn plates were observed for any <b>alloy</b> <b>groups.</b> After the S-L reactions, Ag 3 Sn plates occurred for all groups. The magnitude of the Ag 3 Sn plate growth depended on copper content. This and other effects of copper content on Sn-Ag-Cu interconnects are discussed in this article...|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines has {{investigated}} fumes generated by selected welding electrodes used in mines {{in order to}} help determine their relative health hazard potential. Fumes were generated and collected in an enclosed chamber for subsequent generation rate and chemical constituent determination. Shielded metal arc electrodes from the following groups were tested: AWS types E 308 - 16 and E 310 - 16 stainless steel, ECoCr-A Co-Cr hardfacing alloy, ENiCr Ni, an Mn-Cr buildup alloy, E 7018 carbon steel, and EII 018 -M low-alloy steel. Flux-cored wire electrodes of this last group also were tested. Fume generation rates and the chemical composition of the fumes were measured. From these data, exposure in-dices were determined, which give a relative measure of the health hazard potential of using the electrodes. The effect of welding onto build-up alloy layers on the fume composition also was examined for five of the higher <b>alloy</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R
40|$|Semisolid {{metal forming}} {{has now been}} {{accepted}} as a viable technology for production of components with complex shape and high integrity. The advantages of semisolid metal forming can only be achieved when the feedstock material has a non-dendritic semisolid structure. A controlled nucleation method has been developed to produce such structures for semisolid forming. By controlling grain nucleation and growth, fine-grained and non-dendritic microstructures that are suitable for semisolid casting can be generated. The method was applied to hypoeutectic and hypereutectic Al-Si casting alloys, Al wrought alloys and a Mg alloy. Parameters such as pouring temperature, cooling rate and grain refiner addition were controlled to achieve copious nucleation, nuclei survival and dendritic growth suppression during solidification. The influences of the controlling parameters on the formation of semisolid structure were different {{for each of these}} <b>alloy</b> <b>groups.</b> The as-cast structures were then partially remelted and isothermally held. Semisolid structures were developed and followed by semisolid casting into a stepped die...|$|R
