5|$|Longstreet's {{attack was}} delayed, however, because he {{first had to}} wait for his final brigade (Evander M. Law's, Hood's division) to arrive, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> forced to march on a long, {{circuitous}} route that could not be seen by Union Army Signal Corps observers on Little Round Top. It was 4 p.m. by the time his two divisions reached their jumping off points, and then he and his generals were astonished to find the III Corps planted directly in front of them on the Emmitsburg Road. Hood argued with Longstreet that this new situation demanded a change in tactics; he wanted to swing around, below and behind, Round Top and hit the Union Army in the rear. Longstreet, however, refused to consider such a modification to Lee's order.|$|E
5|$|United dropped {{once again}} to the Second Division {{at the end of}} the 1977–78 season. Dinnis was {{replaced}} by Bill McGarry, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> replaced by Arthur Cox. Cox steered Newcastle back to the First Division {{at the end of the}} 1983–84 season, with players such as Peter Beardsley, Chris Waddle and ex-England captain Kevin Keegan the fulcrum of the team. However, with a lack of funds, Cox left for Derby County and Keegan retired. With managers such as Jack Charlton and then Willie McFaul, Newcastle remained in the top-flight, until key players such as Waddle, Beardsley and Paul Gascoigne were sold, and the team was relegated once more in 1989. McFaul left the managerial post, and was replaced by Jim Smith. Smith left at the start of the 1991–92 season and the board appointed Osvaldo Ardiles his replacement.|$|E

25|$|After {{serving in}} the triumvirate, Villavicencio became Governor of Honda, where on May 20, 1816 he was {{captured}} by the Royalist Army and transported to Santafé.

On June 6, he {{was taken out of}} his cell and his military insignia removed to degrade him, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> executed by a firing squad. Thus Villavicencio, whose visit to Santafé had aroused the anger of the royalists and led to the colony breaking away from Spain, became the first victim of the reign of terror begun with the pacificación (pacification) campaign of the Spanish general, Pablo Morillo, under which many other revolutionaries were sentenced to death, imprisoned or exiled.|$|E
25|$|The {{fifth day}} {{did not hold}} much enthusiasm as the {{scorecards}} might suggest, as India took off from where they started, from 362/6. India's tail wagged as they put on 47 runs {{for the loss of}} 4 wickets. Ajit Agarkar was the first man {{to be out in the}} morning to Andy Bichel, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> followed by Parthiv Patel, whose ill-fated, top-edged hook was caught by a diving Bichel off Gillespie. The two batsmen departed without India adding any run to their score. At 362/8, Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh had a fine outing with the bat. Zaheer swatted a six and three boundaries in his 27 and Harbhajan hit 19 in his own inimitable fashion, as India pushed along to 409. They had obtained a lead of 86– a rarity in Australia against Australia itself. Moreover, this achievement was significant because India were written off before the match even began.|$|E

Facing heavy pressure in the pocket, Brady eluded linebacker Michael Boley and then threw a bullet to Deion Branch. Branch caught the ball {{and ran out of}} bounds at the 33-yard line for a first down. An 11-yard completion from Brady to Hernandez advanced the ball to the Pats' 44, followed by a twelve-men on the field penalty against the Giants, which moved the ball to the Patriots' 49 with 9 seconds left. After an incomplete pass, Brady, on the game's final play, threw a Hail Mary pass intended for Hernandez in the end zone, but the ball was deflected by Giants defenders. Tight end Rob Gronkowski dove with outstretched arms toward the ball but was still a yard away when it hit the ground, ending Super Bowl XLVI and giving New York their fourth Super Bowl win in franchise history.|$|E

Once again the Lions got a big boost from their special teams unit, this time a 27-yard return by Eric Lynch that gave them a first down on the Packers 49. Detroit subsequently drove to the Green Bay 11, including a 3-yard sneak by Krieg on fourth down and 1. But {{over the next three}} plays, Sanders gained two yards, Krieg threw an incomplete pass, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> sacked by linebacker Bryce Paup for a 6-yard loss.

Afterwards, Green Bay ran out the rest of the clock, giving up an intentional safety when punter Craig Hentrich ran out of the end zone on the last play of the contest.|$|E
