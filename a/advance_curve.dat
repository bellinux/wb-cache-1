Simulations of each example using SIRMOD were compared to the measured data to identify the possible benefits of the procedure. The inclusion of runoff did not compromise the ability to reproduce the <b>advance</b> <b>curve</b> however the simulations are more capable of reproducing the measured runoff rates and volumes and therefore offer better estimations of the total volume applied to the soil (in one case a reduction in error of the total infiltration from 22 % to 1 %). This procedure will be of most benefit where the infiltration parameters are expected to represent soil hydraulic characteristics for times greater than the completion of the advance phase. Further analysis has shown that the infiltration parameters are more sensitive to runoff than the advance highlighting the requirement for accurate field measurement and a weighting factor between the advance and runoff errors...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} alcohol fuels in high performance pressure-charged engines such as are typical of the type being developed under the ‘downsizing’ banner. To illustrate this it reports modifications to a supercharged high-speed sports car engine to run on an ethanol-based fuel (ethanol containing 15 % gasoline by volume, or ‘E 85 ’). The ability for engines {{to be able to}} run on alcohol fuels may become very important in the future from both a global warming viewpoint and that of security of energy supply. Additionally, low-carbon-number alcohol fuels such as ethanol and methanol are attractive alternative fuels because, unlike gaseous fuels, they can be stored relatively easily and the amount of energy that can be contained in the vehicle fuel tank is relatively high (although still less than when using gasoline). These fuels also have a much higher octane rating than gasoline which makes them attractive as a fuel for pressure-charged engines, which are frequently knock-limited in their ignition advance curves. The modifications made to the engine include the reconfiguration of the fuel system to investigate making best use of the high latent heat of vaporisation of alcohol by injection of a proportion of the fuel mass before the supercharger - the so-called ‘wet compressor’ technique. With this configuration, engine performance data on E 85 with optimised engine management settings are presented and compared to the original gasolinefuelled performance. Discussion is made {{of the nature of the}} evaporative effect versus oxygen displacement, its effect on supercharger drive power and of the improvement of the spark <b>advance</b> <b>curve</b> as a result of the increase in octane rating of the fuel. To illustrate this response, curves when varying the percentage of fuel delivered upstream of the supercharger are presented. Some discussion of issues to be addressed on the fitment of such an engine to a vehicle is also made, together with how the wet compressor technique might be adopted with minimal impact on evaporative emissions. Conclusions as to the attractiveness of this approach in maximising ethanol-fuelled engine performance are drawn based on the results presented and the vehicle issues listed. There is also some discussion as to how to best configure an ‘omnivorous’ engine to make best use of a range of liquid fuels as they are introduced to the marketplace, with the best efficiency on each...|$|E

40|$|Pinch {{analysis}} {{is based on}} the hot, cold and grand composite curves and is the most commonly-used approach to identify strategies for reducing energy consumption by heat exchanger network retrofit. This method was originally developed for the synthesis of new networks, and there remain certain difficulties for its application to improve existing networks. The <b>advanced</b> composite <b>curves</b> have been developed for retrofit situations specifically, and use data about existing heat exchangers to provide more information about the modifications necessary to achieve heat savings. Bridge analysis, which {{is based on the}} energy transfer diagram, is a new method and enumerates the sets of heat transfer modifications necessary to save energy. In this paper, the grand composite <b>curve,</b> the <b>advanced</b> composite <b>curves</b> and the energy transfer diagram have been constructed for analysis of the heat exchanger network of a kraft pulp mill.

Fundamentally, reducing the energy consumption implies decreasing the flow rate of heat cascaded through the network from the hot utility until the environment.

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: We have {{recently}} introduced several important {{improvements in the}} measurement of distillation curves for complex fluids. The modifications include a composition-explicit data channel for each distillate fraction and temperature measurements that are true thermodynamic state points that can be modeled with an equation of state. The composition-explicit information is achieved with a sampling approach that allows precise qualitative as well as quantitative analyses of each fraction, on the fly. We have applied the method (called the <b>advanced</b> distillation <b>curve</b> technique) {{to a variety of}} fluids, including simple n - alkanes, rocket propellants, gasoline, jet fuels, diesel and biodiesel fuels and crude oils (both petroleum-and bio-derived crude oils). Approach: In this study, we present the application of the method to new, recycled and resourced heavy oils. The ultimate purpose of this work is waste reduction and energy utilization, by placing the reprocessing steps on a more fundamental footing. First, we present measurements on four unused automotive crankcase oils and then four samples of used oils: automotive oil, cutting oil, transformer oil and a commingled lubricant waste stream. Using the <b>advanced</b> distillation <b>curve</b> metrology, we can distinguish between the different weights (viscosity ranges) of crankcase oils and compare them to the sample of used crankcase oil. The distillation curves also provide valuable information regarding {{the presence or absence of}} low-boiling contaminants in the recycled automotive oil, such as water and gasoline. Results: Additionally, we demonstrate the evaluation of all four used lubricant oils. Then, we apply the <b>advanced</b> distillation <b>curve</b> method to a sample of crude oil prepared using a plastic waste stream from an automotive plant. Conclusion: Overall, we conclude that the composition-explicit <b>advanced</b> distillation <b>curve</b> metrology is important for understanding the boiling behavior of the various oils streams and is a valuable diagnostic for future re-refining of the used lubricant oils. This information will be essential in the development of models for the thermophysical properties of such fluids. </FONT...|$|R
