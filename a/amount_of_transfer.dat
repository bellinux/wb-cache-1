2500|$|Sometimes a {{loud noise}} or high pitched squeal {{occurs when the}} brakes are applied. Most brake squeal is {{produced}} by vibration (resonance instability) of the brake components, especially the pads and discs (known as force-coupled excitation). This type of squeal should not negatively affect brake stopping performance. Techniques include adding chamfer pads to the contact points between caliper pistons and the pads, the bonding insulators (damping material) to pad backplate, the brake shims between the brake pad and pistons, etc. All should be coated with an extremely high temperature, high solids lubricant to help reduce squeal. This allows the metal to metal parts to move independently {{of each other and}} thereby eliminate the buildup of energy that can create a frequency that is heard as brake squeal, groan, or growl. It is inherent that some pads are going to squeal more given the type of pad and its usage case. Pads typically rated to withstand very high temperatures for extended periods tend to produce high amounts of friction leading to more noise during brake application. [...] Cold weather combined with high early-morning humidity (dew) often worsens brake squeal, although the squeal generally stops when the lining reaches regular operating temperatures. This more strongly affects pads meant to be used at higher temperatures. Dust on the brakes may also cause squeal and commercial brake cleaning products are designed to remove dirt and other contaminants. Pads without a proper <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> material could also squeal, this can be remedied by bedding or re-bedding the brake pads to brake discs.|$|E

There is no apparatus for elaborating a concentrated and purified nutriment, and distributing it among the component units; but these component units directly imbibe the unprepared nutriment, either from the digestive cavity or from one another. May we not {{say that this is}} what takes place in an aboriginal tribe? All its members severally obtain for themselves the necessaries of life in their crude states; and severally prepare them for their own uses as well as they can. When there arises a decided differentiation between the governing and the governed, some <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> begins between those inferior individuals who, as workers, come directly in contact with the products of the earth, and those superior ones who exercise the higher functions--a transfer parallel to that which accompanies the differentiation of the ectoderm from the endoderm. In the one case, as in the other, however, it is a transfer of products that are little if at all prepared; and takes place directly from the unit which obtains to the unit which consumes, without entering into any general current.|$|E

This problem is also present in Web APIs, because we usually have to implement a specialised client, suited {{for the kind of}} data the Web service is providing. This problem is solved with Linked Data. The problem with Linked Data is the query performance and the availability of remote SPARQL endpoints. With Triple Pattern Fragments we can execute SPARQL queries by transferring some workload to the client, but in contrast we have to transfer more data. The existing AMF extension reduces the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> HTTP requests and consequently the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>transferred</b> data on some queries, while increasing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>transferred</b> data with others. In this thesis we present our extension, where we try to lower the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> HTTP requests and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>transferred</b> data by extending the metadata with a Bloom filter, containing data, linked with triples on the current page of the Triple Pattern Fragment.

50|$|The {{creation}} of the Ontario Council for Articulation and Transfer and the online Ontario College-University Transfer Guide was definitely {{a step in the}} right direction, however the existing agreements listed have a limited scope of program choice, and do not provide a list of guaranteed college credits that can be transferred. The province needs to move toward creating a universal transfer guide that allows students graduating from a diploma program the ability to transfer to any university with a similar degree program by meeting the same requirements for every institution, and receiving the same <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> credits at each institution. This transfer guide should also be easily accessible by students so that they can make informed choices in their course planning and be informed of the number of transfer credits they can receive before they actually apply to an institution. To initiate a move toward universal transfer, the province can first focus on establishing a few core arts and science courses at the college level that would result in direct transfer to university credit at every Ontario university. College faculty can work in conjunction with university faculty to create course curriculum that is comparable to first year general arts and science credits (such as psychology, English, math, history etc.) that the majority of incoming university students are required to take, thus easing the transition process greatly.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the largest}} impediments to {{creating}} comprehensive bridge programs {{is the fact that}} there is no standardized curriculum between similar diploma and degree programs in the province. Without a specified standard of practice outlined for certain fields of study, it becomes almost impossible to guarantee the same <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> credits at every Ontario institution, as it is likely that a student may not have completed a specific course that a student at another institution was required to take. University officials in Renaud’s study also stated that they did not feel comfortable accepting current college curriculum as an equivalent to the first two years of a bachelor’s degree program. They were concerned with the attained education level of the faculty at college campuses, as not all colleges require instructors to possess a Doctorate Degree, or conduct a minimum amount of research. Although this view can be attributed to the elitist attitudes already discussed above, it does call into question how ONCAT is prepared to roll out consistent transfer policies among institutions without attempting to define definitive credits and features in all fields of study. Colleges and universities may not be open to standardizing the curriculum in their programs, as it would mean that they would need to give up the autonomy they previously enjoyed, and possibly lose distinctive features in their curriculum that helped to recruit students to their specific program.|$|E
50|$|The College University Consortium Council (CUCC) {{was created}} in 1996 by the Ministry of Training, Colleges, and Universities as an {{advisory}} body to help devise direct transfer routes between post-secondary institutions for all Ontario students. Its mission statement specifies that the main objective of the council is to “facilitate, promote and coordinate joint education and training ventures that will: aid the transfer of students from sector to sector; facilitate the creation of joint programs between colleges and universities; and further {{the development of a}} more seamless continuum of post-secondary education in Ontario. Membership in the council is voluntary for all post-secondary institutions, but is highly encouraged. While the CUCC aims to help institutions create bridge programs, it still maintains that colleges and universities have full autonomy on the specifics of the agreements created. One of the first projects of the CUCC, was the development of a mutual agreement between Ontario colleges and universities. In 1999, Ontario colleges and universities signed the Ontario College-University Degree Completion Accord (Port Hope Accord), which solidified their commitment to create province-wide agreements to help college graduates enter university programs. This Accord was a monumental achievement, as it explicitly stated that a three year college diploma program should provide a student with a minimum of eleven transfer credits (equivalent to at least 2 years of study) toward a four year bachelor’s degree, and a two year diploma program should allow the student to earn six to eight university transfer credits toward a degree (equivalent to 1 or 1.5 years). These minimum requirements were chosen based on the average <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> credits awarded in the past by Registrars’ Offices across Ontario Universities. Within five years of attaining signatures, forty new college-university agreements were made, providing more opportunities for students to attain a comprehensive education.|$|E

Some lining wear indicators, located either as a semi-metallic layer within the brake pad material or with an external [...] "sensor", are also designed to squeal when the lining is due for replacement. The typical external sensor is fundamentally different from the noises described above (when the brakes are applied) because the wear sensor noise typically occurs when the brakes are not used. The wear sensor may only create squeal under braking when it first begins to indicate wear but is still a fundamentally different sound and pitch.|$|E
