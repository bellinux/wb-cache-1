2500|$|The single was {{released}} digitally exclusive to iTunes on July 7, {{followed by a}} wide and physical release on August 4. The single {{was released}} in two physical versions, CD only and CD/DVD. The DVD edition featured a recording of five songs taken from the band's performance at Shinkiba Studio Coast on May 15, 2010. Yamaguchi and the other band members wanted to add the DVD to the single, as they felt that [...] "Identity" [...] was single made primarily to introduce people to Sakanaction, so felt that a DVD showcase of their most recent concert was appropriate. The concert was later released in full as the Sakanaquarium 2010(C) DVD on February 2, 2011. The first press edition of the physical single came with additional photos of the band during recording sessions and concert performances, and a serial number to apply to attend the band's Sakanaquarium 21.1(B) concert at the Nippon Budokan, held on October 8, 2010. The single featured two additional tracks, the B-side [...] "Holy Dance" [...] and a remix of [...] "Yes No" [...] from Kikuuiki created by Aoki Takamasa.

2500|$|During Jigglypuff's first {{appearance}} ("The Song of Jigglypuff"), {{it was found}} standing on a stump. Misty tried to capture it {{with the help of}} her Staryu, but felt bad when the Jigglypuff started crying. They soon realised that Jigglypuff was upset because it could not sing, and after a series of failed vocal exercises, Brock gave it <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> which soothed its throat. Now capable of singing, it performed for them, putting everyone within hearing range to sleep. This upset Jigglypuff, which angrily dug into Ash's backpack and pulled out a marker which it used to draw on the faces of everyone who fell asleep. Only on two occasions has Jigglypuff believed that anyone had heard its song to the end: in the first, Jigglypuff realizes that Misty's Psyduck was sleeping with its eyes open, and in the second ("A Poké-Block Party"), a Whismur had heard the song the first time and stayed awake due to its Soundproof ability, but on the second time it was tired and fell asleep. In [...] "The Ancient Puzzle of Pokémopolis", Jigglypuff sang to two gigantic Pokémon battling each other, but these two Pokémon did not fall asleep, and instead Jigglypuff was knocked away by the energy of their battle. In the Pokémon short Pikachu's Exploration Club, Jigglypuff is parodied by a Marill, which, in the same fashion, puffs up angrily after putting its audience into sleep with its song. In Pokémon Chronicles, Marina has a Jigglypuff, but when the Jigglypuff uses Sing, people are not affected in part because of Beedrill, whose beating wings are too loud.|$|E

Standard show pens have open wire fronts, and are small for short-term exhibition only during the judging. Short hair hamsters may be shown on hamster bedding while long hair hamsters require something like wood-based cat litter which does not disturb fluffy fur. Water is usually not allowed assuming that the judging is well-managed and quickly done, and instead, the hamster may be given <b>a</b> juicy <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> or vegetable.
