It estimated {{the cost of the}} clean-up to the Galician coast alone at €2.5 billion. However, a court ruling in 2013 put the cost of the disaster at 368 million euros ($494 million) to the Spanish state, 145 million euros to the Spanish region of Galicia and 68 million euros to France. The clean-up of the Exxon Valdez cost US$3 billion (almost €2.2 billion).|$|E

Within the EU, it ranks next to last on knowledge creation and last for innovation and entrepreneurship. In the process of transition to a knowledge economy, it particularly lacks investment into education and a broader application of IT. The World Bank urges Slovakia to upgrade information infrastructure and reform the education system. The OECD states that a stronger product market competition would help.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>report</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Australian CSIRO {{found that}} {{forestry}} and forest-related options {{are the most}} significant and most easily achieved carbon sink making up 105 Mt per year CO2-e or about 75 per cent of the total figure attainable for the Australian state of Queensland from 2010-2050. Among the forestry options, the CSIRO report announced, forestry with the primary aim of carbon storage (called carbon forestry) clearly has the highest attainable carbon storage capacity (77 Mt CO2-e/yr) {{and is one of}} the easiest options to implement compared with biodiversity plantings, pre-1990 eucalypts, post 1990 plantations and managed regrowth. Legal strategies to encourage this form of biosequestration include permanent protection of forests in National Parks or on the World Heritage List, properly funded management and bans on use of rainforest timbers and inefficient uses such as woodchipping old growth forest.|$|E

25|$|The AMA {{has also}} {{supported}} changes in medical malpractice law to limit damage awards, which, it contends, {{makes it difficult}} for patients to find appropriate medical care. In many states, high risk specialists have moved to other states that have enacted reform. For example, in 2004, all neurosurgeons had relocated out of the entire southern half of Illinois. The main legislative emphasis in multiple states has been to effect caps on the amount that patients can receive for pain and suffering. These costs for pain and suffering are only those that exceed the actual costs of healthcare and lost income. At the same time however, states without caps also experienced similar results; suggesting that other market factors {{may have contributed to the}} decreases. Some economic studies have found that caps have historically had an uncertain effect on premium rates. Nevertheless, the AMA believes the caps may alleviate what is often perceived as an excessively litigious environment for many doctors. <b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>report</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> AMA found that in a 12-month period, five percent of physicians had claims filed against them.|$|E
