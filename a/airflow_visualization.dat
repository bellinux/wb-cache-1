An electrically conductive heating tube is used to resistively heat a vapor producing liquid. The heating and delivery systems are integrated to allow the device to present a small cross section to the air flow, thereby reducing disturbances due to the device. The simplicity of the design allows for inexpensive implementation and construction. The design is readily scaled for use in various wind tunnel applications. The device may also find uses in manufacturing, producing a vapor for deposition on a substrate...|$|E

This same result has been obtained by mounting a jet engine simulator at the wing tip and directing the high-energy jet blast downstream into the vortex. These configurations, among others, are now under intensive investigation in the new Langley Vortex Research Facility. In this facility a balance mounted vortex generating model is propelled along the 1800 -foot track while a second model trailed at 160 feet (scale distance of 1 mile) measures the far-field rolling moment induced by the vortex of the generating model...|$|E

The validation process according the accepted validation plan was performed by an outside contractor according to valid standards (methods, calibrations of the measurement equipment and documentation). The tests include measurements of HEPA filter integrity, air volume flow, room differential pressure, <b>airflow</b> <b>visualization,</b> air change rate, airborne particle levels and viable microbial particles. The microbiological testing and measurement of airborne particles were performed both at rest and in operation.

40|$|Airflow hazards such as {{vortices}} or {{low level}} wind shear {{have been identified}} as a primary contributing factor in many helicopter accidents. US Navy ships generate airwakes over their decks, creating potentially hazardous conditions for shipboard rotorcraft launch and recovery. Recent sensor developments may enable the delivery of airwake data to the cockpit, where visualizing the hazard data may improve safety and possibly extend ship/helicopter operational envelopes. A prototype flight-deck <b>airflow</b> hazard <b>visualization</b> system was implemented on a high-fidelity rotorcraft flight dynamics simulator. Experienced helicopter pilots, including pilots from all five branches of the military, participated in a usability study of the system. Data was collected both objectively from the simulator and subjectively from post-test questionnaires. Results of the data analysis are presented, demonstrating a reduction in crash rate and other trends that illustrate the potential of <b>airflow</b> hazard <b>visualization</b> to improve flight safety...|$|R
40|$|Airflow hazards such as turbulence, vortices, or {{low-level}} {{wind shear}} can {{pose a threat}} to landing aircraft and are especially dangerous to helicopters. Because pilots usually cannot see airflow, they may be unaware of the extent of the hazard.

The results of two usability studies of a prototype <b>airflow</b> hazard <b>visualization</b> cockpit decision support system are summarized.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to confront the design-ers {{practice}} knowledge on the behavior of natu-ral ventilation due to wind action in housing buildings with complex internal partitions against experimental analogical airflow visuali-zation. The methodology consisted of a survey with a group of architects, followed by experi-mental <b>airflow</b> <b>visualization</b> in physical scale models of a housing building, developed with a water table. The results from the survey showed that the architects were divided regarding the best and worst natural ventilation performance among the tested housing units. However, the experimental visualization showed that besides the orientation, other factors regarding the building geometry must also be taken into ac-count. The main conclusion is that the architects practice knowledge is not enough for compre-hensively describing the natural ventilation in this type of building, and that the equipment used was very effective and useful for doing it. 1...|$|E
40|$|How {{to model}} airflow {{discharged}} from diffuser {{is believed to}} be one of the key issues in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications to indoor air problem. Due to the complicated geometric feature and the vortex-type airflow induced by swirl diffuser, simulating such a kind of diffuser is claimed to be a challenge. A simplified method of defining the boundary conditions at round swirl inlets is developed and introduced in this paper. With this method a round diffuser was divided into 6 triangular sectors with equal air discharge rate, while various air throw orientation angle was assigned to each sector. CFD simulations were performed based on thermal and airflow boundary conditions recorded in a controlled environment chamber, which was equipped with both ceiling and floor mounted round diffusers. Comparisons between smoke <b>airflow</b> <b>visualization</b> and CFD predictions demonstrated the effectiveness of the current simplified modeling method of swirl diffuser. On top of this, profiles of temperature, air velocity, and CO 2 concentration from measurements were also presented to validate the CFD simulation results...|$|E
40|$|This work aims {{to assess}} human nasal {{blockage}} by investigating {{its influence on}} nasal airflow dynamics, both computationally and experimentally. An in-house CFD code (Lithium) computes the steady (mean) nasal airflow for a cavity constructed from CT images of a healthy adult, for the internal cavity {{and for the first}} time for the external flow. To account for turbulence occurrence, the low Reynolds number k- DJ Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) model is used. The flow field is calculated at different breathing rates by varying the influx rate. Blockages are introduced at various locations inside the cavity to investigate common nasal blockages. The computational results are assessed against published literature and the Particle Image Velocimetry experimental (PIV) results, carried out on a 2. 54 : 1 scale model of the computational nasal cavity. Schlieren optical technique is also used for external nasal <b>airflow</b> <b>visualizations</b> of a human subject, to comment on using an • optical system for clinical application. These computations reveal a significant dependency of both, the internal and external nasal airflow fields on the nasal cavity's geometry. Although for this model, the flow is found to be turbulent in the inspiratory phase of 200 m/Is and higher, it is suggested that the nature of flow can vary depending on the nasal cavity's structure which is influenced by genetics. Nevertheless, some common flow features were revealed such as higher flow rate in the olfactory region and main flow passage through lower airways during inspiration. More uniform flow passage was found in expiration. The results also suggest a possible correlation between the internal geometry of the cavity and the external nasal airflow angle and thickness. This correlation can allow an application of optical systems such as Schlieren which is shown to give accurate qualitative images of the external nasal airflow for assessment of the nasal blockage.

Recent advances in aviation sensor technology offer the potential for aircraft-based sensors that can gather large amounts of airflow velocity data in real-time.

In this paper, we present {{the results of a}} usability study of an <b>airflow</b> hazard <b>visualization</b> system that significantly reduced the crash rate among experienced helicopter pilots flying a high fidelity, aerodynamically realistic fixed-base rotorcraft flight simulator into hazardous conditions.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis has {{the purpose}} to visualize and document the air movements provided by different ventilation principles in an operating theatre. The visualization {{will be made}} {{as simple as possible}} in a physical model. The model and the documentation should be able to use in educational purposes. The study is based on the two most common systems for airflow, currently used in operating theatres. The first principle is displacement ventilation in which the air is supplied at low velocity along the floor. The second principle is vertical parallel laminar airflow in which the air is compressed like a piston from ceiling to the floor. A review of literature resulted in the choice of size, design, and scale factor for the model, as well as choices of ventilation principles and airflows. When the model was completely built and ready to use the air movement were made visible with smoke. The visualization of the air movements was documented with videos. The series of experiments with vertical parallel airflow give a result of air movements, which looks reasonably the same for the different tested velocities of the supply air. The air is forced down over the operating table, and forming a sterile zone, obtaining the form of a cylinder around and over the table. Between {{the outer edge of the}} sterile zone and the walls the smoke accumulates in air eddies. The experiments with displacement ventilation provides a visualization of the air movements that spreads from the diffusers in the corners to the operating table via the floor, and then rise in a more turbulent pattern of movement towards the exhaust diffuser in the ceiling. The visualization of the two air supply principles in the model leads to the following conclusions: The model is suitable to visualize the air movement arising from the principle of vertical parallel <b>airflow.</b> The <b>visualization</b> of air movements with displacement ventilation will be more realistic if the experiments were made with lowered velocity of the supply air, if the supply air is colder than the air in the operating theatre and if heat sources are placed in the room. The model can be easily understood and used to visualize air movements in an operating theatre. The model can be used to give hospital staff a better idea of the importance of the ventilation in operation theatres. Eddies in the air movements are a problem in all experiments. Less eddies are detected at higher air velocities and with partial exhaust at roof height. To sort out what impact eddies have on protection ventilation requires more studies focusing on this factor. A continued development of the model will make the visualizations of the air movements in the model more realistic...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of investigations whose aim was to describe the influence of the pressure difference level on the ability of contaminants migration between neighbouring rooms in dynamic conditions associated with door swing. The analysis was based on <b>airflow</b> <b>visualization</b> made with cold smoke, which simulated the heavy contaminants. The test room was pressurized to a specific level and then the door was opened to observe the trail of the smoke plume in the plane of the door. The door was opened in both directions: to the positively and negatively pressurized room. This study focuses on the visualization of smoke plume discharge and an uncertainty analysis is not applicable. Unlike other studies which focus on the analysis of pressure difference, the present study looks at the contaminants which are heavier than air and on "pumping out" the contaminants by means of door swing. Setting the proper level of pressure difference between the contaminated room and the neighbouring rooms can prove instrumental in ensuring protection against toxic contaminants migration. This study helped to establish the threshold of pressure difference necessary to reduce migration of heavy contaminants to neighbouring rooms...|$|E
40|$|Models {{can help}} us {{understand}} the climate conditions inside naturally ventilated buildings in order to improve the efficiency of the design. Naturally ventilated buildings use temperature gradients to create buoyancy forces in the space and drive the airflow pathways in the space. One architectural design feature that facilitates natural ventilation is the presence of stack ventilation in the roof of the building, which facilitates the expulsion of heated air from the space. An architectural feature that changes the airflow pathways is the presence of railing on the upper floors where there is a danger of falling into the atrium. Using the model of a naturally ventilated building located in the Building Technology Department at MIT <b>airflow</b> <b>visualization</b> studies were carried out using incense to view the airflow patterns in the model. The variables of temperature, size of stack ventilation opening, and whether there were railings in the building or not were varied to determine their effects on the airflow. Temperature had the effect of increasing the velocity of the airflow, but did not significantly change the overall airflow profile. The size of the stack vent opening changed the airflow pathways significantly as did adding railings into the model. Comparing the results with a computational fluid dynamics model shows that there are some discrepancies. by Melissa Cain. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|One {{cause for}} the {{substantial}} amount of energy used for data center cooling is poor airflow effects such as hot-aisle to cold-aisle air recirculation. To correct these and to investigate innovative designs that will notably increase efficiency requires a robust, well-verified computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Most above-plenum data center CFD models are only validated using temperature data. Although a temperature-only validation method can be useful, it does not confirm that the airflow patterns predicted by the CFD model are accurate. Since the airflow patterns above a raised-floor plenum should be confidently understood before they can be optimized, it is necessary to adopt a validation method that offers more than just a comparison of temperature data. This paper summarizes the unique validation process of a CFD model for a small data center test cell located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The validation method features point velocity and temperature measurements and the use of small neutrally-buoyant bubbles to visualize the airflow patterns above a raised-floor plenum. The data center test cell was designed to emulate a standard hot-aisle and cold-aisle airflow configuration. The <b>airflow</b> <b>visualization</b> revealed that each perforated tile had a substantial non-uniform air velocity distribution leading to an unexpected three-dimensional flow pattern above the racks. When this surprising reality was properly accounted for in the CFD boundary conditions, good agreement was found with the observed airflow patterns. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to show the difficulties and value of utilizing more robust validation techniques for data center CFD models...|$|E
40|$|The {{state of}} the art in {{aeronautical}} engineering has been continually accelerated by the development of advanced analysis and design tools. Used in the early design stages for aircraft and spacecraft, these methods have provided a fundamental understanding of physical phenomena and enabled designers to predict and analyze critical characteristics of new vehicles, including the capability to control or modify unsatisfactory behavior. For example, the relatively recent emergence and routine use of extremely powerful digital computer hardware and software has had a major impact on design capabilities and procedures. Sophisticated new <b>airflow</b> measurement and <b>visualization</b> systems permit the analyst to conduct micro- and macro-studies of properties within flow fields on and off the surfaces of models in advanced wind tunnels. Trade studies of the most efficient geometrical shapes for aircraft can be conducted with blazing speed within a broad scope of integrated technical disciplines, and the use of sophisticated piloted simulators in the vehicle development process permits the most important segment of operations the human pilot to make early assessments of the acceptability of the vehicle for its intended mission. Knowledgeable applications of these tools of the trade dramatically reduce risk and redesign, and increase the marketability and safety of new aerospace vehicles. Arguably, one of the more viable and valuable design tools since the advent of flight has been testing of subscale models. As used herein, the term "model" refers to a physical article used in experimental analyses of a larger full-scale vehicle. The reader is probably aware that many other forms of mathematical and computer-based models are also used in aerospace design; however, such topics are beyond the intended scope of this document. Model aircraft have always been a source of fascination, inspiration, and recreation for humans since the earliest days of flight. Within the scientific community, Leonardo da Vinci, George Cayley, and the Wright brothers are examples of early aviation pioneers who frequently used models during their scientific efforts to understand and develop flying machines. Progress in the technology associated with model testing in worldwide applications has firmly established model aircraft as a key element in new aerospace research and development programs. Models are now routinely used in many applications and roles, including aerodynamic data gathering in wind tunnel investigations for the analysis of full-scale aircraft designs, proof-of-concept demonstrators for radical aeronautical concepts, and problem-solving exercises for vehicles already in production. The most critical contributions of aerospace models are to provide confidence and risk reduction for new designs and to enhance the safety and efficiency of existing configurations...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringM. H. HosniB. W. JonesThis {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} airflow {{distribution in the}} longitudinal direction of a wide-body mockup aircraft cabin, turbulence energy and dissipation rates, {{and the effect of}} thermal plumes, generated by passengers, on airflow distribution within the cabin. The mockup cabin utilized for this study mimics a Boeing 767 passenger cabin and includes 11 rows in the longitudinal direction with each row consisting of seven seats. Each seat is occupied by an inflatable manikin which is instrumented with a 10 meters long wire heater generating approximately 100 Watts of distributed sensible heat, representing heat load from a sedentary human being. In order to investigate the fluid dynamics characteristics of the airflow within the cabin, different experimental techniques were implemented. Smoke visualization was used to qualitatively visualize the general airflow pattern inside the cabin. A tracer gas composed mainly of carbon dioxide was used to track the airflow distribution inside the cabin. The tracer gas was released in several locations and then sampled at various locations throughout the mockup cabin. The release and sampling of the tracer gas allowed tracing the airflow inside the cabin using non dispersive infrared sensors. Combining results from different release-sampling scenarios gave better understanding of the chaotic and three-dimensional nature of the airflow behavior inside the cabin. Air speed and turbulence parameters were evaluated using omni-directional probes. Finally, the effect of the heat generated by the thermal manikins on the airflow behavior was investigated. The results from the <b>airflow</b> <b>visualization</b> and the tracer gas were complementary and showed that there were multiple air circulations {{along the length of the}} cabin. The dimension of the circulations were controlled by the minimum physical distance inside the cabin. The identified-isotropic turbulence were spread over the full width of the cabin in the front and middle sections of the cabin, whereas, multiple-smaller circulations were identified in the rear section. Cabin sections identified with high speed fluctuations were associated with higher turbulence kinetic energy levels and lower local dissipation rates. These sections served as driving forces to create the circulations identified in the tracer gas experiments. Furthermore, the heat generated by the thermal manikins was shown to significantly impact the behavior of the gaseous flow inside the cabin, the turbulence parameters, and speed fluctuations. Detailed uncertainty analysis was conducted to estimate the uncertainty limits for the measurements taken. The uncertainty estimates obtained for the tracer gas results ranged from ± 14 % for the test cases with the heated manikins to ± 17 % with the corresponding unheated manikins cases. The data uncertainty limits for the turbulence parameters were of higher levels due to limitations associated with the omni-directional probes used to measure the speed. With flow repeatability phenomena in same locations inside the mockup cabin during different days reaching up to ± 10 %, the uncertainty estimates were considered acceptable for these chaotic and highly random airflow conditions within the cabin...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{document}} is to identify and describe strategies for the engineering control of worker exposure during the production or use of engineered nanomaterials. Engineered nanomaterials are materials that are intentionally produced and {{have at least one}} primary dimension less than 100 nanometers (nm). Nanomaterials may have properties different from those of larger particles of the same material, making them unique and desirable for specific product applications. The consumer products market currently has more than 1, 000 nanomaterial-containing products including makeup, sunscreen, food storage products, appliances, clothing, electronics, computers, sporting goods, and coatings. As more nanomaterials are introduced into the workplace and nano-enabled products enter the market, it is essential that producers and users of engineered nanomaterials ensure a safe and healthy work environment. The toxicity of nanoparticles may be affected by different physicochemical properties, including size, shape, chemistry, surface properties, agglomeration, biopersistence, solubility, and charge, as well as effects from attached functional groups and crystalline structure. The greater surface-area-to-mass ratio of nanoparticles makes them generally more reactive than their macro-sized counterparts. These properties are the same ones that make nanomaterials unique and valuable in manufacturing many products. Though human health effects from exposure have not been reported, a number of laboratory animal studies have been conducted. Pulmonary inflammation has been observed in animals exposed to nano-sized TiO 2 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Other studies have shown that nanoparticles can translocate to the circulatory system and to the brain causing oxidative stress. Of concern is the finding that certain types of CNTs have shown toxicological response similar to asbestos in mice. These animal study results are examples, and further toxicological studies need to be conducted to establish the potential health effects to humans from acute and chronic exposure to nanomaterials. Currently, there are no established regulatory occupational exposure limits (OELs) for nanomaterials in the United States; however, other countries have established standards for some nanomaterials, and some companies have supplied OELs for their products. In 2011, NIOSH issued a recommended exposure limit (REL) for ultrafine (nano) titanium dioxide and a draft REL for carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers. Because of the lack of regulatory standards and formal recommendations for many nanomaterials in the United States, {{it is difficult to determine}} or even estimate a safe exposure level. Many of the basic methods of producing nanomaterials occur in an enclosure or reactor, which may be operated under positive pressure. Exposure can occur due to leakage from the reactor or when a worker 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s activities involve direct manipulation of nanomaterials. Batchtype processes involved in the production of nanomaterials include operating reactors, mixing, drying, and thermal treatment. Exposure-causing activities at production plants and laboratories employing nanomaterials include harvesting (e. g., scraping materials out of reactors), bagging, packaging, and reactor cleaning. Downstream activities that may release nanomaterials include bag dumping, manual transfer between processes, mixing or compounding, powder sifting, and machining of parts that contain nanomaterials. Hazards involved in manufacturing and processing nanomaterials should be managed as part of a comprehensive occupational safety, health, and environmental management plan. Preliminary hazard assessments (PHAs) are frequently conducted as initial risk assessments to determine whether more sophisticated analytical methods are needed. PHAs are important so that the need for control measures is realized, and the means for risk mitigation can be designed to be part of the operation during the planning stage. Engineering controls protect workers by removing hazardous conditions or placing a barrier between the worker and the hazard, and, with good safe handling techniques, they are likely to be the most effective control strategy for nanomaterials. The identification and adoption of control technologies that have been shown effective in other industries are important first steps in reducing worker exposures to engineered nanoparticles. Properly designing, using, and evaluating the effectiveness of these controls is a key component in a comprehensive health and safety program. Potential exposure control approaches for commonly used processes include commercial technologies, such as a laboratory fume hood, or techniques adopted from the pharmaceutical industry, such as continuous liner product bagging systems. The assessment of control effectiveness is essential for verifying that the exposure goals of the facility have been successfully met. Essential control evaluation tools include time-tested techniques, such as <b>airflow</b> <b>visualization</b> and measurement, as well as quantitative containment test methods, including tracer gas testing. Further methods, such as video exposure monitoring, provide information on critical task-based exposures, which will help to identify high-exposure activities and help provide the basis for interventions.
