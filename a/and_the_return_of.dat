Through this study we would like to foster the possibility that the applicability of any social science may be strengthened by action research as a specific form <b>of</b> intervention <b>and</b> change. <b>The</b> <b>returning</b> <b>of</b> inquiry findings to the subjects may also be linked to action research as it focuses on involving the subjects of the research in the debate concerning the results.
