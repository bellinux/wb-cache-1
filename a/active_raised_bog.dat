40|$|Raised bogs {{started to}} form in Ireland at least 7000 years ago when peat started to {{accumulate}} in water-filled depressions left after the last glacial period. Due to centuries of damaging human activities, only 1 % of the living, growing <b>active</b> <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> habitat remains and this is rapidly being lost. Raised bogs are important reservoirs of biodiversity, hosting many uniquely adapted {{plant and animal species}} and are of high conservation concern internationally. The aims of this study were to objectively assess the potential of macro-moths as <b>active</b> <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> biodiversity indicators, to collate baseline information on the distribution of this fauna on threatened midland raised bog habitat and to identify species with restricted distributions which may be of conservation concern. Macro-moths were sampled using light-traps on twelve midland raised bogs from early July to the end of October in 2011. Six high conservation value bogs designated as Special Areas of Conservations (SACs) and six undesignated and degraded bogs were surveyed. A total of 1, 816 adult individuals of 93 moth species were recorded, representing 16 % of the Irish moth fauna. Four species new to County Offaly were recorded.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study aimed at improving the spatial representation of eco-hydrological communities on ombrotrophic (rain-fed) peatlands. Remote sensing techniques have shown potential for peatland monitoring but most previous work has focussed on spectral approaches. Such methods often result in poor discrimination of cover types and also neglect information on the presence of peatland microtopes (e. g. hummocks and hollows), which show strong links to hydrological condition, biodiversity and carbon sequestration. Spatial information on surface structure is therefore a useful proxy for peatland condition. The paper first demonstrates how airborne LiDAR data can provide such information. Secondly, we apply a combined multispectral-structural approach using IKONOS and airborne LiDAR data to the mapping of peatland condition classes (defined by the lowland raised bog inventory) at Wedholme Flow, Cumbria, UK. LiDAR data were pre-processed so that spatial estimates of minimum and maximum land surface height, variance and semi-variance (from semivariogram analysis) were extracted. These were assimilated into a spectral classification procedure with an IKONOS dataset where thematic outputs from per-pixel maximum likelihood classification were compared. Field ecological survey data were used to validate the results which showed considerable improvements in thematic separation of peatland eco-hydrological classes, when spatially-distributed measurements of LiDAR variance or semivariance at 5 m lag were included. Of key importance was the improved delineation of management classes (Eriophorum bog, <b>active</b> <b>raised</b> <b>bog,</b> Rhynchospora alba communities, and Calluna- and Erica-dominated degraded raised bog). The paper demonstrates how combined textural-optical approaches can offer improvements in land cover mapping products in areas where reliance on purely spectral discrimination approaches would otherwise result in considerable thematic uncertainty...|$|E

Peatlands contain structural “microtopes ” (e. g., hummocks and hollows) which are linked to hydrology, biodiversity and carbon sequestration, and information on surface structure is thus a useful proxy for peatland condition. Th e objective of this work was to develop and test a new eco-hydrological mapping technique for ombrotrophic (rain-fed) peatlands using a combined spectral-structural remote sensing approach. Th e study site was Wedholme Flow, Cumbria, UK. Airborne light dectection and ranging (LiDAR) data were used with IKONOS data in a combined multispectral-structural approach for mapping peatland condition classes. LiDAR data were preprocessed so that spatial estimates of minimum and maximum land surface height, variance and semi-variance (from semi-variogram analysis) were extracted. Th ese were assimilated alongside IKONOS data into a maximum likelihood classifi cation procedure, and thematic outputs were compared. Ecological survey data were used to validate the results. Considerable improvements in thematic separation of peatland classes were achieved when spatially-distributed measurements of LiDAR variance or semi-variance were included. Specifi cally, the classifi cation accuracy improved from 71. 8 % (IKONOS data only) to 88. 0 % when a LiDAR semi-variance product was used.

40|$|The {{member states}} of the European Community are obliged to monitor the {{development}} of conservation status of natural habitats protected by the Habitats Directive. In Denmark a comprehensive programme on nature monitoring, called NOVANA, was launched in 2004. The monitoring programme is developed by the Danish National Environmental Research Institute (NERI). <b>Raised</b> <b>bogs</b> {{are one of the}} natural habitats included in the programme. This master thesis investigates how the nature monitoring of <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> is organized in Denmark. Based on raised bogs’ unique ecology, it is assessed whether NERI’s approach to monitor <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> is adequate. The thesis focuses on application of methods to monitor vegetation ecology. As a part of this research project, two <b>raised</b> <b>bogs,</b> Skidendam and Holmegårds Mose, have been subjected to nature monitoring during autumn 2004. Similar nature monitoring was conducted in both bogs in 1987 and 1995. In order to examine the development of conservation status of the bogs over the time span, the results from the three sets of data are compared. The thesis takes in theories on ecology of <b>raised</b> <b>bogs,</b> theories on organization of nature monitoring and theories on aggregation of monitoring data. It is concluded that the conservation status of Skidendam is favourable; that the conservation status of Holmegårds Mose is unfavourable. Moreover, it is concluded that NERI’s approach to nature monitoring of <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> is inadequate. NERI’s approach to nature monitoring of <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> is based on an insufficient understanding of the special hydrological and morphological structure of <b>raised</b> <b>bogs.</b> This has resulted in the use of inappropriate criteria for favourable conservation status of <b>raised</b> <b>bogs.</b> NERI’s approach to nature monitoring is organized against these criteria. Furthermore, the placement of sample plots to monitor vegetation ecology do not consider the inhomogeneous structure of raised bogs’ vegetation.

The largest contiguous <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> in central Europe was the Bourtange Moor, which originally covered an area of about 2,300 km² including the Dutch portion, but only small sections remain.

50|$|Thus the <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> rises {{very slowly}} above {{the level of}} the {{groundwater}} level, hence its name.
