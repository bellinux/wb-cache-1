The power of the labor unions was significantly curtailed by the Taft–Hartley Act, which was enacted over Truman's veto. Truman twice vetoed bills to lower income tax rates in 1947. Although the initial vetoes were sustained, Congress overrode his veto of <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> bill in 1948. The parties did cooperate on some issues; Congress passed the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, making the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate rather than the Secretary of State next in line to the presidency after the Vice President.|$|E

[...] The bill also contained a further extension of unemployment benefits and the Medicare reimbursement rates. [...] The cost of the tax cut was not offset by spending cuts, but the other provisions were offset by cuts in federal healthcare and pension programs. [...] Republican support for the bill was motivated by a desire to not oppose <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> in an election year.

[...] His reaction to criticism was often severe, prompting his political enemies to derisively refer to him as [...] "Emperor Julian." [...] During the final year of Carroll's term, Lt. Gov.

500|$|The {{surplus in}} fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion—the third {{consecutive}} surplus and the largest surplus ever. In 2001, Bush's budget estimated {{that there would be}} a $5.6trillion surplus over the next ten years. Facing congressional opposition, Bush held townhall style meetings across the U.S. in order to increase public support for his plan for a $1.35trillion tax cut program—one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history. Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers, saying [...] "the surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money." [...] Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned of a recession and Bush stated that <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> would stimulate the economy and create jobs. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine Social Security. O'Neill disputes the claim, made in Bush's book Decision Points, that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts. By 2003, the economy showed signs of improvement, though job growth remained stagnant. Another tax cut program was passed that year.|$|E

Romney said at the time: [...] "I frankly wish that the last Congress would have dealt with the stimulus issue and that the president [...] could assign that before leaving office. I think there is need for economic stimulus. Americans have lost about $11 trillion in net worth. That translates into about $400 billion a year less spending that they'll be doing, and that's net of additional government programs like Medicaid and unemployment insurance. And government can help make that up in a very difficult time.... I'd move quickly. These are unusual times. But it has to be something which relieves pressure on middle-income families. I think <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> is necessary for them as well as for businesses that are growing. We'll be investing in infrastructure and in energy technologies." [...] However, as a candidate for president in May 2012, Romney said that the economic stimulus package that had been enacted in February 2009 (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) had been a waste of money that did little to jump-start the economy, and that the federal government had inflated the numbers of jobs that had been created or preserved by the various projects funded through the stimulus program.|$|E

Harper criticized the plan, saying would increase taxpayers' burden and that Dion should be [...] "honest with the people" [...] that some environmental measures will cost the economy and said the plan includes $40 billion in carbon taxes and $26 billion in tax cuts. Dion defended the Liberal's Green Shift, saying that [...] " [...] not true at all", and that [...] "for every dollar that we will raise, you will have <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut,</b> and these tax cuts will be on your income". Duceppe commented that he would like targets to be applied to individual provinces, thereby allowing Quebec to financially benefit due to already-implemented greenhouse gas reductions. Layton, who favours a cap-and-trade system, said that it is a [...] "figment of Mr. Harper's imagination" [...] that emissions will fall under his plan. When Harper sought to outline his government's record on other environmental fronts, giving examples of his minority government supported the preservation {{of hundreds of thousands of}} hectares of environmentally sensitive land through the Nature Conservancy of Canada, and that the government declared a protected marine area by Lake Superior and created a whale sanctuary by Baffin Island, May responded by saying [...] "The only word he said that's true is on national parks".|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> is a {{reduction}} in taxes. The immediate effects of <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> are {{a decrease in the}} real income of the government and an increase in the real income of those whose tax rate has been lowered. Due to the perceived benefit in growing real incomes among tax payers, politicians have sought to claim their proposed tax credits as tax cuts. In the longer term, however, the loss of government income may be mitigated, depending on the response of tax-payers. The longer-term macroeconomic effects of <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> are not predictable in general, because they depend on how the taxpayers use their additional income and how the government adjusts to its reduced income.|$|E
