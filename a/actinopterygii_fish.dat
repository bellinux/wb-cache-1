50|$|The Exocoetidae are {{a family}} of marine fish in the order Beloniformes class <b>Actinopterygii.</b> <b>Fish</b> of this family are known as flying fish. About 64 species are grouped in seven to nine genera. Flying fish can make powerful, {{self-propelled}} leaps out of water into air, where their long, wing-like fins enable gliding flight for considerable distances above the water's surface. This uncommon ability is a natural defence mechanism to evade predators.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{multiplicity}} {{or loss of}} the vitellogenin (vtg) {{gene family}} in vertebrates has been argued to have broad implications for the mode of reproduction (placental or non-placental), cleavage pattern (meroblastic or holoblastic) and character of the egg (pelagic or benthic). Earlier proposals {{for the existence of}} three forms of vertebrate vtgs present conflicting models for their origin and subsequent duplication. Results By integrating phylogenetics of novel vtg transcripts from old and modern teleosts with syntenic analyses of all available genomic variants of non-metatherian vertebrates we identify the gene orthologies between the Sarcopterygii (tetrapod branch) and <b>Actinopterygii</b> (<b>fish</b> branch). We argue that the vertebrate vtg gene cluster originated in proto-chromosome m, but that vtg genes have subsequently duplicated and rearranged following whole genome duplications. Sequencing of a novel fourth vtg transcript in labrid species, and the presence of duplicated paralogs in certain model organisms supports the notion that lineage-specific gene duplications frequently occur in teleosts. The data show that the vtg gene cluster is more conserved between acanthomorph teleosts and tetrapods, than in ostariophysan teleosts such as the zebrafish. The differential expression of the labrid vtg genes are further consistent with the notion that neofunctionalized Aa-type vtgs are important determinants of the pelagic or benthic character of the eggs in acanthomorph teleosts. Conclusion The vertebrate vtg gene cluster existed prior to the separation of Sarcopterygii from Actinopterygii > 450 million years ago, a period associated with the second round of whole genome duplication. The presence of higher copy numbers in a more highly expressed subcluster is particularly prevalent in teleosts. The differential expression and latent neofunctionalization of vtg genes in acanthomorph teleosts is an adaptive feature associated with oocyte hydration and spawning in the marine environment. </p...|$|E

5000|$|Osteichthyes, bony fish, are paraphyletic {{when they}} include only <b>Actinopterygii</b> (ray-finned <b>fish)</b> and Sarcopterygii (lungfish, etc.).

50|$|Guiyu was {{described}} by Chinese palaeontologist Min Zhu and others in 2009, based on a near-complete articulated specimen. It {{was described}} as a basal lobe-finned fish with anatomical features of both ray-finned and lobe-finned fishes, although, analysis of the totality of its features place it closer to the class Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes). Guiyu sheds light on the early diversification of bony fishes. This clade, the osteichthyans, splits in two clades: the lobe-finned and the ray-finned (<b>Actinopterygii)</b> <b>fishes.</b> According to new data from Guiyu, this split occurred no later than 419 million years ago, during the early Devonian period. Guiyu had spine-bearing pectoral girdle, a feature which can be found in primitive gnathostome vertebrates. Other early bony-fish with remarkable features include Andreolepis, Lophosteus, Psarolepis, Ligulalepis and Dialipina.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, Osteichthyes is {{considered}} a class, recognised on having a swim bladder, only three pairs of gill arches, hidden behind a bony operculum and a predominately bony skeleton. Under this classification systems, the Osteichthyes are paraphyletic with regard to land vertebrates as the common ancestor of all Osteichthyes includes tetrapods amongst its descendants.

5000|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1961 by Gerlof Fokko Mees. This author identified the species {{as belonging to}} the Galaxiidae, but the relationship to those species was in doubt. Lepidogalaxias salamandroides was eventually placed among the Osmeriformes as a monotypic arrangement, Lepidogalaxias (Lepidogalaxiidae), in 1991.

50|$|Osteichthyes , popularly {{referred}} to as the bony fish, is a diverse taxonomic group of fish that have skeletons primarily composed of bone tissue, as opposed to cartilage. The vast majority of fish are members of Osteichthyes, which is an extremely diverse and abundant group consisting of 45 orders, and over 435 families and 28,000 species. It is the largest class of vertebrates in existence today.The group Osteichthyes is divided into the ray-finned <b>fish</b> (<b>Actinopterygii)</b> and lobe-finned <b>fish</b> (Sarcopterygii). The oldest known fossils of bony fish are from about 420 million years ago and are also transitional fossils, showing a tooth pattern that is in between the tooth rows of sharks and bony fishes.|$|R
50|$|This {{has led to}} an {{alternative}} classification, splitting the Osteichthyes into two full classes. Paradoxically, Sarcopterygii is under this scheme monophyletic, as it includes the tetrapods, making it a synonym of the clade Euteleostomi.

50|$|Synanceiidae is {{a family}} of <b>Actinopterygii,</b> ray-finned <b>fish,</b> found in the Indo-Pacific oceans.

Its species {{are known to have}} the most potent neurotoxins of all the fish venoms, secreted from glands at the base of their needle-like dorsal fin spines.

25|$|Bony fishes, class Osteichthyes, are characterised by bony {{skeleton}} {{rather than}} cartilage. They {{appeared in the}} late Silurian, about 419 million years ago.

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{position of}} bichirs is disputed, {{and they have}} been variously aligned with ray-finned <b>fish</b> (<b>Actinopterygii)</b> or lobe-finned <b>fish</b> (Sarcopterygii), which also include tetrapods. Alternatively, they have been placed into their own group, the Brachiopterygii. The phylogenetic position of bichirs as possibly the most primitive living bony fish (Osteichthyes) made knowledge about their mitochondrial genome of considerable evolutionary interest. We determined the complete nucleotide sequence (16, 624 bp) of the mitochondrial genome of a bichir, Polypterus ornatipinnis. Its genome contains 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNAs, two rRNAs and one major noncoding region. The genome's structure and organization show that this is the most basal vertebrate that conforms to the consensus vertebrate mtDNA gene order. Bichir mitochondrial protein-coding and ribosomal RNA genes have greater sequence similarity to ray-finned fish than to either lamprey or lungfish. Phylogenetic analyses suggest the bichir's placement as the most basal living member of the ray-finned fish and rule out its classification as a lobe-finned fish. Hence, its lobe-fins are probably not a shared-derived trait with those of lobe-finned fish (Sarcopterygii) ...|$|R

We conducted the analyses both without and with correction (by independent contrasts) for phylogenetic effects. Across the full suite of 461 surveyed genera, relatively small but significant positive correlations were present between species richness and evolutionary increases in C-value.

25|$|The first jawed {{vertebrates}} probably {{developed during}} the late Ordovician period. They are first represented in the fossil record from the Silurian by two groups of fish: the armoured fish known as placoderms, which evolved from the ostracoderms; and the Acanthodii (or spiny sharks). The jawed fish that are still extant in modern days also appeared in late Silurian: the Chondrichthyes (or cartilaginous fish) and the Osteichthyes (or bony fish). The bony fish evolved into two separate groups: the <b>Actinopterygii</b> (or ray-finned <b>fish)</b> and Sarcopterygii (which includes the lobe-finned fish).|$|R
40|$|The family Polypteridae, {{commonly}} known as "bichirs", is a lineage that diverged early in the evolutionary history of <b>Actinopterygii</b> (ray-finned <b>fish),</b> but {{has been the subject}} of far less evolutionary study than other members of that clade. Uncovering patterns of morphological change within Polypteridae provides an important opportunity to evaluate if the mechanisms underlying morphological evolution are shared among actinoptyerygians, and in fact, perhaps the entire osteichthyan (bony fish and tetrapods) tree of life. However, the greatest impediment to elucidating these patterns is the lack of a well-resolved, highly-supported phylogenetic tree of Polypteridae. In fact, the interrelationships of polypterid species have never been subject to molecular phylogenetic analysis. Here, we infer the first molecular phylogeny of bichirs, including all 12 recognized species and multiple subspecies using Bayesian analyses of 16 S and cyt-b mtDNA. We use this mitochondrial phylogeny, ancestral state reconstruction, and geometric morphometrics to test whether patterns of morphological evolution, including the evolution of body elongation, pelvic fin reduction, and craniofacial morphology, are shared throughout the osteichthyan tree of life...|$|R

We propose a new method, based on Bayesian hierarchical clustering and poste-rior probability, to measure congruence between genes and to identify sets of congruent loci within which the genes or proteins share identical evolutionary history.

25|$|The Devonian Period {{is broken}} into the Early, Middle and Late Devonian. By {{the start of}} the Early Devonian 419 mya, jawed fishes had divided into four {{distinct}} clades: the placoderms and spiny sharks, both of which are now extinct, and the cartilaginous and bony fishes, both of which are still extant. The modern bony fishes, class Osteichthyes, appeared in the late Silurian or early Devonian, about 416 million years ago. Both the cartilaginous and bony fishes may have arisen from either the placoderms or the spiny sharks. A subclass of bony fishes, the ray-finned <b>fishes</b> (<b>Actinopterygii),</b> have become the dominant group in the post-Paleozoic and modern world, with some 30,000 living species.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Actinopterygii</b> (ray-finned <b>fishes)</b> is {{the largest}} and most diverse {{vertebrate}} group, but little is agreed about the timing of its early evolution. Estimates using mitochondrial genomic data suggest that the major actinopterygian clades are much older than divergence dates implied by fossils. Here, the timing of the evolutionary origins of these clades is reinvestigated using morphological, and nuclear and mitochondrial genetic data. Results indicate that existing fossil-based estimates of the age of the crown-group Neopterygii, including the teleosts, Lepisosteus (gar) and Amia (bowfin), are at least 40  Myr too young. We present new palaeontological evidence that the neopterygian crown radiation is a Palaeozoic event, and demonstrate that conflicts between molecular and morphological data for the age of the Neopterygii result, in part, from missing fossil data. Although our molecular data also provide an older age estimate for the teleost crown, this range extension remains unsupported by the fossil evidence. Nuclear data from all relevant clades are used to demonstrate that the actinopterygian whole-genome duplication event is teleost-specific. While the date estimate of this event overlaps the probable range of the teleost stem group, a correlation between the genome duplication and the large-scale pattern of actinopterygian phylogeny remains elusive...|$|R
