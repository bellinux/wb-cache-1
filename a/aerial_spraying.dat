5|$|Between 1950 and 1952, {{trials were}} {{conducted}} in Tanganyika, at Kikore and Stunyansa, to test arboricides and defoliants under tropical conditions. The chemicals involved were 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, and endothall (3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid). During 1952–53, the unit supervised the <b>aerial</b> <b>spraying</b> of 2,4,5-T over the Waturi peninsula in Kenya to assess the value of defoliants in the eradication of tsetse fly.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. <b>Aerial</b> <b>spraying</b> of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed {{as studies have shown}} that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of phosphite into the stem of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is costly to administer and restricted to known plants.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the mid-1940s, Carson {{had become}} {{concerned}} {{about the use of}} synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the military funding of science since World War II. It was the US federal government's 1957 gypsy moth eradication program, however, that prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons. The gypsy moth program involved <b>aerial</b> <b>spraying</b> of DDT and other pesticides (mixed with fuel oil), including the spraying of private land. Landowners on Long Island filed a suit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely. Though the suit was lost, the Supreme Court granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.|$|E

5|$|Banksia verticillata {{has been}} {{declared}} vulnerable under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and Rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. A 1995 census yielded an estimated total population size of 4500 plants. Apart from dieback and aerial canker, frequency of bushfires and illegal picking have been cited as threats. Ongoing management includes monitoring of current populations, gathering more data on best response to fire, and restricting access to populations. Seed has been collected from many populations, but germination rates after ten years of storage are much lower than in Banksia brownii. Translocation is considered an option in the future, as is spraying with phosphite, particularly {{in the vicinity of}} Walpole. Used successfully on B.brownii but as yet untrialled with B.verticillata, phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. <b>Aerial</b> <b>spraying</b> of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed as studies have shown that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} of Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has resisted criticism of <b>aerial</b> <b>spraying</b> of coca and poppy and has seen major reductions in both crops {{according to the}} United Nations Office of Crime and Drugs (See also Plan Colombia). In 2003, over 1,300 square kilometers of mature coca were sprayed and eradicated in Colombia, where {{at the start of}} the year, approximately 1,450 square kilometers had been planted. This strategic accomplishment prevented the production over 500 tonnes of cocaine, sufficient to supply all the cocaine users in both US and Europe for one year. Further, it eliminated upward of $100 million of illicit income in Colombia. No effect on prices or availability in the marketplace has been noted, and the actual number of acres of coca planted seems to have actually increased, largely shifting to more remote areas or into neighboring countries. <b>Aerial</b> <b>spraying</b> also has the unintended consequence of destroying legitimate crop fields in the process.|$|E

40|$|AGDISP (<b>Aerial</b> <b>Spray</b> Simulation Model) is used {{to predict}} the {{deposition}} of spray material released from an aircraft. Determining the optimal input values to AGDISP {{in order to produce}} a desired spray material deposition is extremely difficult (NP hard). SAGA, an intelligent optimization method based on the simple genetic algorithm, was developed to solve this problem. In this paper, we apply several nature inspired heuristics to this problem. The first method still uses the genetic algorithm, but changes its type, selection method, crossover and mutation operator. The second method applies a neural network to improve the initial population, crossover and mutation. The third method uses GADO, a general-purpose approach to solving the parametric design problem.
