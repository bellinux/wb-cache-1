5|$|A breed society, the Jacob Sheep Society, {{was formed}} in July 1969. Mary Cavendish, dowager Duchess of Devonshire, who had <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> Jacob sheep at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, was the first {{president}} of the society. From 1972 onwards, the society published a flock book.|$|E
5|$|Anonymous is {{the first}} internet-based super-consciousness. Anonymous is a group, {{in the sense that}} <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> birds is a group. How do you know they’re a group? Because they’re {{travelling}} in the same direction. At any given moment, more birds could join, leave, peel off in another direction entirely.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{possible}} to teach a migration route to <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> birds, for example in re-introduction schemes. After a trial with Canada geese Branta canadensis, microlight aircraft {{were used in the}} US to teach safe migration routes to reintroduced whooping cranes Grus americana.|$|E

5|$|A leucistic Coragyps atratus brasiliensis was {{observed}} in Piñas, Ecuador in 2005. It had white plumage overall, with only the tarsus and tail {{as well as some}} undertail feathers being black. It was not an albino as its skin seemed to have had the normal, dark color and it was part of <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> some twenty normally plumaged individuals.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} mammals, {{domestic}} sheep reproduction occurs sexually. Their reproductive strategy {{is very similar}} to other domestic herd animals. <b>A</b> <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> sheep is generally mated by a single ram, which has either been chosen by a farmer or has established dominance through physical contest with other rams (in feral populations). Most sheep have a breeding season (tupping) in the autumn, though some are able to breed year-round.|$|E
5|$|Causes {{of death}} of adult ibis {{are not well}} known. Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises {{but there has been}} little {{research}} in the area. <b>A</b> <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (Typha angustifolia), which suggested they had taken shelter there. It is unclear why they {{had not been able to}} fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E

5|$|In {{the later}} and better-known version of Compert Con Culainn, Deichtine is Conchobar's sister, and disappears from Emain Macha, the Ulster capital. As in the {{previous}} version, the Ulstermen go hunting <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> magical birds, are overtaken by a snowstorm and seek shelter in a nearby house. Their host is Lug, but this time his wife, who gives birth to a son that night, is Deichtine herself. The child is named Sétanta.|$|E
5|$|The mallard usually feeds by dabbling {{for plant}} food or grazing; {{there are reports}} of it eating frogs. However, in 2017 <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> mallards in Romania were {{observed}} hunting small migratory birds, including grey wagtail and black redstart, the first documented occasion they had been seen attacking and consuming large vertebrates. It usually nests on a river bank, but not always near water. It is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and forms large flocks, which are known as sords.|$|E
5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} {{is found in}} North Africa and the Middle East. In Africa its range extends through Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Sudan, Egypt, Eritrea, Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Mali, Mauritania, Chad and Niger. In the Middle East it is native to Oman, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan, Syria, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan and its range extends as far as Pakistan and north west India. In 2016, <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> around a hundred birds arrived at Kutch after a gap of 19 years.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a focus light on Madonna's hand which {{gradually}} reveals a circular red stage surrounded by red curtains. Madonna, wearing the red velvet jacket moves around the stage throwing off a cape and does choreographed dance moves. Interspersed are visuals of a male dancer as a Minotaur wearing the horned mask, dancing {{on the ground and}} Madonna in the matador dress. She entices the male dancer with the cape as the chorus ends. <b>A</b> <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> male dancers wearing similar horned mask appear and surround Madonna around the stage.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{are visible}} in stalls. Behind {{them is a}} {{crumbling}} wall with three low Romanesque windows. Four shepherds in contemporary 15th-century clothing are chatting amiably, leaning against the wall, looking into the shed. Two are positioned {{to the left and}} two to the right; in each pair one is dressed in red and an other in blue. Behind the shed is a small hill where two shepherds herd sheep along a pathway, and beyond is a Netherlandish town with two domed structures in its center, symbolizing Jerusalem and Christ's Passion. The large domed building is based on the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, a replica of which the Adornes family built in Bruges in 1427, called the Jerusalem chapel. <b>A</b> <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> geese is visible high in the sky through the roof's trusses.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos are diurnal {{and require}} {{daylight}} {{to find their}} food. They are not early risers, instead waiting until the sun has warmed their roosting sites before feeding. All species are generally highly social and roost, forage and travel in colourful and noisy flocks. These vary in size depending on availability of food; in times of plenty, flocks are small and number a hundred birds or less, while in droughts or other times of adversity, they may swell up to contain thousands or even {{tens of thousands of}} birds; one record from the Kimberley noted <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> 32,000 little corellas. Species that inhabit open country form larger flocks than those of forested areas.|$|E

5|$|Longleat Estate has fenced off a {{large part}} of its land and has {{introduced}} goats, as part of a programme to encourage the biodiversity of the area; the goats were intended to replace the sheep that grazed in the gorge until the 1970s. The National Trust announced in March 2007 that it plans to release <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> sheep on its side of the gorge for the same purpose, but will first consult local residents and interested parties on whether to fence off the gorge or introduce cattle grids to prevent the sheep from straying. There is already a small flock of feral Soay sheep in the gorge.|$|E
5|$|New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. Unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have {{a good sense of}} smell with which they locate carcasses. The turkey vulture has a red head. The black vulture has a grey head. Although not a water bird, <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> black vultures at the Myakka River State Park, southeast of Sarasota, has been seen bathing {{at the edge of the}} lake and then drying out their wings in the same way as cormorants like the Florida anhinga. This habit may help free them of parasites.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} sermons I have ever been privileged to hear was by the late Bishop of Winchester. Social exclusion? He said {{virtually}} that if one sheep from <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> 100 goes missing, the good shepherd worries frantically about that single sheep until it is safely found. There are too many sheep, men, women and children, being marginalised. John the Baptist had the answer: why do we not? I remain concerned in these turbulent times, but {{thank you for your}} patience. It has been my privilege to be able to speak in your Lordships' House.|$|E

50|$|Pigeon Mountain {{may have}} been named because the peak's outline resembles a pigeon, or because {{settlers}} saw <b>a</b> large <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> pigeons there.|$|R
5|$|Singing also occurs {{outside the}} {{breeding}} season, taking place {{throughout the year}} apart from the moulting period. The songsters are more commonly male although females also sing on occasion. The function of such out-of-season song is poorly understood. Eleven other types of call have been described including a flock call, threat call, attack call, snarl call and copulation call. The alarm call is a harsh scream, and while foraging together common starlings squabble incessantly. They chatter while roosting and bathing, making {{a great deal of}} noise that can cause irritation to people living nearby. When <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> common starlings is flying together, the synchronised movements of the birds' wings make a distinctive whooshing sound that can be heard hundreds of metres (yards) away.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> birds {{encountered}} the hurricane over eastern Virginia; hundreds of birds {{were killed and}} fell to the ground near Old Point Comfort, many stripped of their feathers. The outer rainbands of the storm produced heavy amounts of precipitation near Washington, D.C., canceling a baseball game between the Detroit Tigers and the Washington Senators after the field was flooded. In Ocean City, Maryland, the hurricane was considered the worst in 40years. The hurricane produced 80mph (130km/h) winds and rough waves along the Delaware Capes, indicating hurricane-force winds affected the state. It was one of only two storms on record to produce such winds in the state. Three barges and a steamer capsized in the Delaware Bay, while onshore, the winds of the hurricane destroyed the roofs of four houses in Laurel. The winds downed many trees and destroyed several chimneys near Lewes. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, winds reached , which damaged telegraph and phone lines, knocked down several trees, and damaged the roof of Pennsylvania Railroad's Broad Street Station.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham had one serious {{accident}} whilst flying. On 20 November 1975 at Dunsfold Aerodrome, Surrey, <b>a</b> <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> Snowy plover birds {{collided with the}} British Aerospace BAe 125 aircraft just after takeoff and were ingested by the engines. Cunningham was forced to make an emergency landing. He put the aircraft down at , onto the runway, but it careered through {{the perimeter of the}} airfield and across a public road where it collided with a car carrying four passengers who were killed; no-one died on board the HS-125. Cunningham suffered two crushed vertebra but he remained chief test pilot at Hawker Siddeley after the accident until 1978 when British Aerospace was formed. He was awarded the Segrave Trophy for his services in 1978. In recognition of his wartime exploits and his contribution to civil aviation, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire and retired from British aerospace in 1980.|$|E
