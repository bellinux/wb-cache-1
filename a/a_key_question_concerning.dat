40|$|The {{theory of}} {{corporate}} governance underwent {{a revolution in}} the 19702 ̆ 7 s. Theorists finally abandoned the myth that a public corporation 2 ̆ 7 is managed by its board of directors, and constructed a new model under which the corporation is managed by its executive officers, and the board, dominated by outside directors, monitors management 2 ̆ 7 s performance. This new 2 ̆ 2 monitoring model 2 ̆ 2 has gained wide acceptance among commentators, and several of its elements have been adopted by many public corporations. Even those commentators who do not enthusiastically embrace the entire monitoring model tend to agree that monitoring management is a significant board function. But expositions of the monitoring model to date have been rudimentary. Its proponents have not suggested what forces will prompt corporations to adopt the model and thereby move it from theory to widely accepted reality. Nor have they described in detail what the board 2 ̆ 7 s duties would be under the model, much less how these duties would be discharged. Until these problems are satisfactorily resolved, the potential of the monitoring model for improving corporate governance must be considered an open question. This Article grapples with these problems. In exploring the possible mechanisms for enforcing adoption of and performance under the monitoring model, the Article concludes that market forces alone will not suffice and that legislative solutions face insuperable political and theoretical obstacles. 6 Accordingly, special attention is given to the duty of care of directors and officers as a possible enforcement mechanism. The duty of care has been a problem child of corporate law. Its command that directors and officers perform their duties with reasonable prudence appears on its face to provide a significant constraint on directors and officers, especially in an age when control has become divorced from ownership in public corporations. 7 In practice, however, the duty of care has proved almost totally ineffectual. 8 <b>A</b> <b>key</b> <b>question</b> <b>concerning</b> the monitoring model, then, is what will be the content of the duty of care given the new role of the director that the model envisions and, more particularly, whether the duty of care can be revived and used as a tool for enforcing the monitoring model...|$|E

Sox 17 expression enabled transiently reconstituting adult progenitors to give long-term multilineage reconstitution that resembled fetal hematopoiesis, including increased erythropoiesis, increased myelopoiesis, and decreased lymphopoiesis.

When controlling for ability measures of EI, the Big Five personality measures, general self-efficacy, cognitive intelligence, and self-rated performance, both self-report measures of EI and mixed competency measures of EI show incremental validity and relative importance in predicting OCB and CWB. An analysis of self-report EI found that the effects of EI on OCB and CWB are stronger in health care and service industries than in industries where emotional labor demands are lower.

In determining the dynamics and energetics of the radio sources over cosmic time, <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>question</b> <b>concerns</b> what happens when their jets switch off. The resulting `remnant' radio-loud AGN have been surprisingly evasive in past radio surveys, and therefore statistical information on the population of radio-loud AGN in their dying phase is limited. In this paper, with the recent developments of LOFAR and the VLA, we are able to provide a systematically selected sample of remnant radio-loud AGN in the Herschel-ATLAS field. Using a simple core-detection method, we constrain the upper limit on the fraction of remnants in our radio-loud AGN sample to 9 per cent, implying that the extended lobe emission fades rapidly once the core/jets turn off. We also find that our remnant sample has a wide range of spectral indices (- 1. 5 ≤α^ 1400 _ 150 ≤ - 0. 5), confirming that the lobes of some remnants may possess flat spectra at low frequencies just as active sources do. We suggest that, even with the unprecedented sensitivity of LOFAR, our sample may still only contain the youngest of the remnant population. Comment: 23 pages, 5 tables, 5 Figure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is {{substantial}} variation in herd risk for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Ireland, with most herds playing {{little to no}} role in the ongoing endemic. In infected areas, bTB persistence (affecting one or a group of herds) is <b>a</b> <b>key</b> feature of the infection. In this paper, we present our current understanding and management of bTB risk in Ireland, based on a detailed review of research and policy. There is close interaction between science and policy in Ireland, seeking both to understand and effectively manage bTB risk. Detailed research on bTB persistence is presented, including current understanding of the relative importance of different infection sources, which can include residual infection in cattle and/or re-infection, either from local sources or following cattle introduction. In recent years, there have been three primary drivers for policy change, including scientific advances, ongoing improvements to programme supports, and ongoing programme review. In this review, three key future programme challenges are identified. Although good progress is being made, eradication has not yet been achieved. Firstly, <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>question</b> <b>concerns</b> the additional effort that will be required, to move towards final eradication.

Here, using an in vitro system of conditionally immortalized differentiated human podocytes (CIDHPs), we document a pivotal role for the p 66 ShcA protein in HIV- 1 -induced reactive oxygen species generation and CIDHP apoptosis. CIDHP transfected with truncated HIV- 1 construct (NL 4 - 3) exhibit increased reactive oxygen species metabolism, DNA strand breaks, and a 5 -fold increase in apoptosis, whereas the opposite was true for NL 4 - 3 /CIDHP co-transfected with mu- 36 p 66 ShcA (mu- 36) dominant negative expression vector or isoform-specific p 66 -small interfering RNA. Phosphorylation at Ser- 36 of the wild type p 66 ShcA protein, required for p 66 ShcA redox function and inhibition of the potent stress response regulator Foxo 3 a, was unchanged in mu- 36 /NL 4 - 3 /CIDHP but increased in NL 4 - 3 /CIDHP. Acute knockdown of Foxo 3 a by small interfering RNA induced a 50 % increase in mu- 36 /NL 4 - 3 /CIDHP apoptosis, indicating that Foxo 3 a-dependent responses promote the survival phenotype in mu- 36 cells.

One potential downstream target is phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase). In this study, we demonstrate that anti-CD 3 and anti-Fyn immunoprecipitates possess PI 3 -kinase activity as assessed by TLC and HPLC. Both free and receptor-bound p 59 fyn(T) were found to bind to the lipid kinase. Further, our results indicate that Src-related kinases have developed a novel mechanism to interact with PI 3 -kinase. Precipitation using GST fusion proteins containing Fyn SH 2, SH 3, and SH 2 /SH 3 domains revealed that PI 3 -kinase bound principally to the SH 3 domain of Fyn. Fyn SH 3 bound directly to the p 85 subunit of PI 3 -kinase as expressed in a baculoviral system. Anti-CD 3 crosslinking induced an increase in the detection of Fyn SH 3 -associated PI 3 -kinase activity. Thus PI 3 -kinase is a target of SH 3 domains and is likely to play a major role in the signals derived from the TCR zeta/CD 3 -p 59 fyn complex...|$|R

40|$|Humans have an {{impressive}} ability to augment their creative state (i. e., to consciously try and succeed at thinking more creatively). Though this "thinking cap" phenomenon is commonly experienced, {{the range of}} its potential has not been fully explored by creativity research, which has often focused instead on creativity as <b>a</b> trait. <b>A</b> <b>key</b> <b>question</b> <b>concerns</b> {{the extent to which}} conscious augmentation of state creativity can improve creative reasoning. Although artistic creativity is also of great interest, it is creative reasoning that frequently leads to innovative advances in science and industry. Here, we studied state creativity in analogical reasoning, a form of relational reasoning that spans the conceptual divide between intelligence and creativity and is a core mechanism for creative innovation. Participants performed a novel Analogy Finding Task paradigm in which they sought valid analogical connections in a matrix of word-pairs. An explicit creativity cue elicited formation of substantially more creative analogical connections (measured via latent semantic analysis). Critically, the increase in creative analogy formation was not due to a generally more liberal criterion for analogy formation (that is, it appeared to reflect "real" creativity rather than divergence at the expense of appropriateness). The use of an online sample provided evidence that state creativity augmentation can be successfully elicited by remote cuing in an online environment. Analysis of an intelligence measure provided preliminary indication that the influential "threshold hypothesis," which has been proposed to characterize the relationship between intelligence and trait creativity, may be extensible to the new domain of state creativity...|$|R
