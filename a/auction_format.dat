25|$|The NYSE {{trades in}} a {{continuous}} <b>auction</b> <b>format,</b> where traders can execute stock transactions on behalf of investors. They will gather around the appropriate post where a specialist broker, who is employed by a NYSE member firm (that is, he/she is not {{an employee of the}} New York Stock Exchange), acts as an auctioneer in an open outcry auction market environment to bring buyers and sellers together and to manage the actual auction. They do on occasion (approximately 10% of the time) facilitate the trades by committing their own capital {{and as a matter of}} course disseminate information to the crowd that helps to bring buyers and sellers together. The auction process moved toward automation in 1995 through the use of wireless hand held computers (HHC). The system enabled traders to receive and execute orders electronically via wireless transmission. On September 25, 1995, NYSE member Michael Einersen, who designed and developed this system, executed 1000 shares of IBM through this HHC ending a 203-year process of paper transactions and ushering in an era of automated trading.|$|E

Several promising ascending combinatorial <b>auction</b> <b>formats</b> have been developed throughout {{the past few years}} based on primal-dual algorithms and linear programming theory. The Ascending Proxy Auction (Ausubel and Milgrom 2006 a) and iBundle (Parkes and Ungar 2000) result in Vickrey payoffs when the coalitional value function satisfies buyer submodularity conditions and bidders bid best-response.

40|$|Abstract. We study two {{standard}} multi-unit <b>auction</b> <b>formats</b> for allo-cating {{multiple units}} {{of a single}} good to multi-demand bidders. The first one is the Discriminatory Auction, which charges every winner his win-ning bids. The second is the Uniform Price Auction, which determines a uniform {{price to be paid}} per unit. Variants of both formats find appli-cations ranging from the allocation of state bonds to investors, to online sales over the internet. For these formats, we consider two bidding inter-faces: (i) standard bidding, which is most prevalent in the scientific liter-ature, and (ii) uniform bidding, which is more popular in practice. In this work, we evaluate the economic inefficiency of both multi-unit <b>auction</b> <b>formats</b> for both bidding interfaces, by means of upper and lower bounds on the Price of Anarchy for pure Nash equilibria and mixed Bayes-Nash equilibria. Our developments improve significantly upon bounds that have been obtained recently for submodular valuation functions. Also, for the first time, we consider bidders with subadditive valuation functions under these <b>auction</b> <b>formats.</b> Our results signify near-efficiency of these auctions, which provides further justification for their use in practice. ...|$|R
40|$|Even though auctions are {{capturing}} {{an increasing}} share of commerce, they are typically {{treated in the}} theoretical economics literature as isolated. That is, an auction is typically treated as a single seller facing multiple buyers or as a single buyer facing multiple sellers. In this paper, we review {{the state of the}} art of competition between auctions. We consider three different types of competition: competition between <b>auctions,</b> competition between <b>formats,</b> and competition between auctioneers vying for auction traffic. We highlight the newest experimental, statistical and analytical methods in the analysis of competition between auctions. auctions, bidding, competition, <b>auction</b> <b>formats,</b> <b>auction</b> houses...|$|R

40|$|The {{direct sale}} of {{emission}} allowances by auction is an emerging characteristic of cap-and-trade programs. This study {{is motivated by}} the observation {{that all of the}} major implementations of cap-and-trade regulations for the control of air pollution have started with a generous allocation of allowances relative to recent emissions history, a situation we refer to as a â€œloose cap. â€ Typically more stringent reductions are achieved in subsequent years of a program. We use an experimental setting to investigate the effects of a loose cap environment on a variety of auction types. We find that all <b>auction</b> <b>formats</b> studied are efficient in allocating emission allowances, but auction revenues tend to be lower relative to competitive benchmarks when the cap is loose. Regardless of whether the cap is tight or loose, the different <b>auction</b> <b>formats</b> tend to yield comparable revenues toward the end of a series of auctions. However, aggressive bidding behavior in initial discriminatory auctions yields higher revenues than in the other <b>auction</b> <b>formats,</b> a difference that disappears as bidders learn to adjust their bids closer to the cut-off that separates winning and losing bids. auction, carbon dioxide, greenhouse gases, allowance trading, Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, RGGI, cap and trade, Environmental Economics and Policy, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|Multi-unit auctions are {{promising}} mechanisms for the reallocation of water. The main advantage of such auctions {{is to avoid}} the lumpy bid issue. However, there is great uncertainty about the best <b>auction</b> <b>formats</b> when multi-unit <b>auctions</b> are used. The theory can only supply the structural properties of equilibrium strategies and the multiplicity of equilibria makes comparisons across <b>auction</b> <b>formats</b> difficult. Empirical studies and experiments have improved our knowledge of multi- unit auctions but they remain scarce and most experiments are restricted to two bidders and two units. Moreover, they demonstrate that bidders have limited rationality and learn through experience. This paper constructs an agent-based model of bidders to compare the performance of alternative <b>auction</b> <b>formats</b> under circumstances where bidders submit continuous bid supply functions and learn over time to adjust their bids to improve their net incomes. We demonstrate that under the generalized Vickrey, simulated bids converge towards truthful bids as predicted by the theory and that bid shading is the rule for the uniform and discriminatory auctions. Our study allows us to assess the potential gains from agent-based modelling approaches {{in the assessment of}} the dynamic performance of multi-unit procurement auctions.

40|$|The paper empirically studies why {{the sellers}} of {{identical}} commodities adopt dier- ent <b>auction</b> <b>formats</b> {{in the online}} auction, and the consequences thereof.

We rst use these two characteristics to endogeneize the seller's choice between three auction formats: xed-price, buy-it-now (BIN), and pure auctions. We then estimate the dierences in sales rate, transaction price, and sale duration between the three formats. We nd that the xed-price auc- tion results in the highest transaction price and the lowest sale rate, while the pure auction is just the opposite, with the BIN auction falling in between. These results strongly suggest that there is a tradeo between price and sale probability in adopting dierent <b>formats</b> of <b>auctions.</b> We...|$|R

By taking realistic parameters fitting the data, and compare the theoretical predictions of the revenues from the two <b>auction</b> <b>formats,</b> we show that the revenue difference is minimal with a fixed number of participants. When the difference in participation is taken into account, the revenue difference predicted by the linear model is quite similar to the empirical results of Athey, Levin and Seira (2004). ...|$|R
