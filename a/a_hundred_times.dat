There were a few guest conductors for the Sunday concerts, but most were conducted by Beecham. In the Courtauld-Sargent series the LPO played not only under Sargent but under many guests including Bruno Walter, George Szell, Fritz Busch and Igor Stravinsky.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film, was {{released}} in theaters worldwide on July 26 and July 27, 2007. Previous attempts to create a film version of The Simpsons failed {{due to the lack}} of a script of appropriate length and production crew members. Eventually, producers Brooks, Groening, Al Jean, Mike Scully, and Richard Sakai began development of the film in 2001. They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one developed into a film. The script was re-written over <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>times,</b> and this creativity continued after animation had begun in 2006. The film was a box office success, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews.|$|E

Seventeen of those foreign players come from one of the other Home Nations of the UK, seven players come from elsewhere in Europe, two from South America, two from Africa, five from the Caribbean islands, and two from North America. There are no players in the list from either Asia or Australasia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{previous}} {{attempts to}} create a Simpsons film had been made, they failed {{due to the lack}} of a script of appropriate length and production crew members. Eventually in 2001, producers James L. Brooks, Matt Groening, Al Jean, Richard Sakai and Mike Scully began development of the film, and a writing team consisting of Brooks, Groening, Jean, Scully, Ian Maxtone-Graham, George Meyer, David Mirkin, Mike Reiss, Matt Selman, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti was assembled. They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one developed into a film. The script was re-written over <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>times,</b> and this rewriting continued after the animation had begun in 2006. Consequently, hours of finished material was cut from the final release, including cameo roles from Erin Brockovich, Minnie Driver, Isla Fisher, Kelsey Grammer and Edward Norton. Hanks and Green Day appeared in the final cut as themselves.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the future, IK Pegasi A will consume the {{hydrogen}} fuel at its core and start to evolve away from the main sequence to form a red giant. The envelope of a red giant can grow to significant dimensions, extending up to <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>times</b> its previous radius (or larger). Once IK Pegasi A expands to the point where its outer envelope overflows the Roche lobe of its companion, a gaseous accretion disk will form around the white dwarf. This gas, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, will then accrete onto the surface of the companion. This mass transfer between the stars will also cause their mutual orbit to shrink.|$|E

5|$|Music {{journalist}} Charles Thomson noted {{a continued}} media bias against Jackson after the Chandler suicide. Thomson {{said he was}} contacted by a British tabloid to supply information about the 1993 allegations, only to have them replace his carefully researched information with the common myths he advised them to avoid and that the same misinformation was in every article he read about the suicide. He noted when Jackson's FBI file was released the following month, the contents were portrayed by the media as giving an impression of guilt even though the file strongly supported his innocence. He noted how Gene Simmons' allegations in 2010 about Jackson molesting children received over <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>times</b> more coverage than his interview with Jackson's long-time guitarist, Jennifer Batten, who rebutted Simmons' claims.|$|E
5|$|The Via Panisperna boys {{also noticed}} some unexplained effects. The {{experiment}} {{seemed to work}} better on a wooden table than a marble table top. Fermi remembered that Joliot-Curie and Chadwick had noted that paraffin wax was effective at slowing neutrons, {{so he decided to}} try that. When neutrons were passed through paraffin wax, they induced <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>times</b> as much radioactivity in silver compared with when it was bombarded without the paraffin. Fermi guessed that this was due to the hydrogen atoms in the paraffin. Those in wood similarly explained the difference between the wooden and the marble table tops. This was confirmed by repeating the effect with water. He concluded that collisions with hydrogen atoms slowed the neutrons. The lower the atomic number of the nucleus it collides with, the more energy a neutron loses per collision, and therefore the less collisions that are required to slow a neutron down by a given amount. Fermi realised that this induced more radioactivity because slow neutrons were more easily captured than fast ones. He developed a diffusion equation to describe this, which became known as the Fermi age equation.|$|E
