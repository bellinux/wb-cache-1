Grant first refused a request of truce, thinking it a show of weakness. Finally he relented, and the Confederates held their fire while the Union recovered the wounded and dead, soldiers from both sides mingling and trading <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>no</b> hostilities existed for the moment.|$|E

Admiral William Sims charged after the war that in April, 1917, only ten percent of the Navy's warships were fully manned; the rest lacked 43% of their seamen.

No man can observe you as I have observed you and not know that it was a matter of conscience with you, but I am afraid, my friend, that it is one of the blunders of virtue." [...] Ultimately Trescott decides to move Henry, who has sustained disfiguring injuries to his face and psyche, to a local negro household, but Henry's presence proves troubling for the family's well-being, and he is moved to another. [...] One night Henry absconds, visiting various people around town and leaving terrified neighbors in his wake, including Bella Farragut, who he attempts to court <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>no</b> time has passed since they last met. [...] Not welcome anywhere else, Henry is eventually moved to the carriage-house in the newly built Trescott home. [...] Despite Dr. Trescott's protection, Henry is branded a monster by the townspeople, who avoid the Trescotts as a result. [...] Although previously Henry's friend, Jimmie now mocks him, daring his friends to approach the disfigured man.

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{dominant}} theme {{in the book is}} that of solitude. [...] Macondo was founded in the remote jungles of the Colombian rainforest. [...] The solitude of the town is representative of the colonial period in Latin American history, where outposts and colonies were, for all intents and purposes, not interconnected. Isolated {{from the rest of the}} world, the Buendías grow to be increasingly solitary and selfish. [...] With every member of the family living only for him or her self, the Buendías become representative of the aristocratic, land-owning elite who came to dominate Latin America in keeping with the sense of Latin American history symbolized in the novel. [...] This egocentricity is embodied, especially, in the characters of Aureliano, who lives in a private world of his own, and Remedios the Beauty, who innocently destroys the lives of four men enamored by her unbelievable beauty, because she is living in a different reality due to her autism. [...] Throughout the novel it seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>no</b> character can find true love or escape the destructiveness of their own egocentricity.|$|E
2500|$|A {{new theory}} called the phi complex has been {{developed}} by J. A.

[...] After a short period, {{the movements of the}} two subjects sometimes became coordinated and synchronized (but other times continued to be asynchronous). [...] The link between EEG and conscious social interaction is described as Phi, one of several brain rhythms operating in the 10Hz range. [...] Phi consists of two components: one to favor solitary behavior and another to favor interactive (interpersonal) behavior. [...] Further analysis of Phi may reveal the social and interpersonal implications of degenerative diseases such as schizophrenia—or may provide insight into common social relationships such as the dynamics of alpha and omega-males or the popular bystander effect describing how people diffuse personal responsibility in emergency situations depending on the number of other individuals present.|$|E

[...] Mark Thomas of Mania also gave it an overall score of A, stating: [...] "It has plenty of good action and thought provoking plot points." [...] Andy Patricio of IGN rated the first DVD volume 9/10 praised the animation, stating: [...] "Artwork is richer; this is easily the best-looking anime Production I.G. has ever produced. CG is richer and more widely-used. Animation is more complex and fluid, although it's still a little jerky, which is common in TV shows." [...] Joe Luscik of Animefringe ranked the series 4.5 out of 5 praising the animation stating it [...] "is just awesome".

Applicants should not express opinions too strongly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>no</b> possible counterviews were possible. The topic should be something the applicant cares about, and should show leadership {{in the sense of}} [...] "asserting yourself to help others have more success." [...] According to Dunbar, leadership is not necessarily about being in charge such as being the team captain or school president. Applicants should present a broad perspective and avoid simplistic words such as never, always, only, or nobody, which suggest narrow thinking.
