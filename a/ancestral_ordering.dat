Bayes-N is an {{algorithm}} for Bayesian network {{learning from}} data based on local measures of information gain, applied to problems {{in which there}} is a given dependent or class variable and a set of independent or explanatory variables from which we want to predict the class variable on new cases.

40|$|Gene order evolves through gross {{chromosomal}} rearrangements, {{small scale}} inversions and transpositions, gene duplication, and gene loss. Much {{research has been}} done on the calculation of edit distance and on sorting algorithms under a variety of rearrangement models in which the genome may be represented as conserved segments with permuted order and orientation. However, gene loss within otherwise conserved segments, as typically occurs following large scale genome duplication, has not been well studied algorithmically. This has been a major impediment to comparative genomics in certain taxa, such as plants and fish. When large scale genome duplication and gene loss are occurring, how well can we infer both the true gene order within ancestral chromosomal segments and the <b>ancestral</b> <b>ordering</b> of those segments? We propose a heuristic algorithm for the inference of ancestral gene order in a set of genomes for which at least some genomic segments are partially related by common ancestry to two or more different segments. It does not require gene content and order to be perfectly conserved among segments. First, conserved chromosomal regions are identified using existing pairwise genomic alignment algorithms. Second, segments are iteratively clustered under the control of two parameters, (1) the minimal required number of shared genes between two segments or clusters and (2) the maximal allowed number of rearrangement breakpoints along the lineage leading to each descendant segment. Finally, we compute the estimated ancestral gene order for each cluster. We evaluate the performance of this algorithm on simulated data that models a genome evolving by large-scale duplication, duplicate gene loss, transposition, translocation, and inversion. The results suggest that ancestral gene orders may be estimated with sufficient accuracy to substantially improve the detection sensitivity of pairwise genomic alignment algorithms...|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{the context}} of <b>ancestral</b> gene <b>order</b> {{reconstruction}} from extant genomes, there exist two main computational approaches: rearrangement-based, and homology-based methods. The rearrangement-based methods consist in minimizing a total rearrangement distance on {{the branches of a}} species tree. The homology-based methods consist in the detection of a set of potential ancestral contiguity features, followed by the assembling of these features into Contiguous Ancestral Regions (CARs). Results: In this paper, we present a new homology-based method that uses a progressive approach for both the detection and the assembling of ancestral contiguity features into CARs. The method is based on detecting a set of potential ancestral adjacencies iteratively using the current set of CARs at each step, and constructing CARs progressively using a 2 -phase assembling method. Conclusion: We show the usefulness of the method through a reconstruction of the boreoeutherian <b>ancestral</b> gene <b>order,</b> and a comparison with three other homology-based methods: AnGeS, InferCARs and GapAdj.

We identify 3171 intervals, covering ∼ 92 % of the human genome, within which we find no rearrangements larger than 50 kilobases (kb) in the lineages leading to human, mouse, rat, and dog from their most recent common ancestor. Combining intervals that are adjacent in all contemporary species produces 1338 segments that may contain large insertions or deletions but that are free of chromosome fissions or fusions as well as inversions or translocations > 50 kb in length. We describe a new method for predicting the <b>ancestral</b> <b>order</b> and orientation of those intervals from their observed adjacencies in modern species.

40|$|Reconstructing <b>ancestral</b> gene <b>orders</b> {{in a given}} {{phylogeny}} is {{a classical}} problem in comparative genomics. Most existing methods compare conserved features in extant genomes in the phylogeny to define potential ancestral gene adjacencies, and either try to reconstruct all ancestral genomes under a global evolutionary parsimony criterion, or, focusing on a single ancestral genome, use a scaffolding approach to select a subset of ancestral gene adjacencies, generally aiming at reducing the fragmentation of the reconstructed ancestral genome. In this paper, we describe an exact algorithm for the Small Parsimony Problem that combines both approaches. We consider that gene adjacencies at internal nodes of the species phylogeny are weighted, and we introduce an objective function defined as a convex combination of these weights and the evolutionary cost under the Single-Cut-or-Join (SCJ) model. The weights of ancestral gene adjacencies can e. g. be obtained through the recent availability of ancient DNA sequencing data, which provide a direct hint at the genome structure of the considered ancestor, or through probabilistic analysis of gene adjacencies evolution. We show the NP-hardness of our problem variant and propose a Fixed-Parameter Tractable algorithm based on the Sankoff-Rousseau dynamic programming algorithm that also allows to sample co-optimal solutions.

40|$|Abstract Background Lepidoptera {{encompasses}} {{more than}} 160, 000 described species {{that have been}} classified into 45 – 48 superfamilies. The previously determined Lepidoptera mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) are limited to six superfamilies of the lineage Ditrysia. Compared with the <b>ancestral</b> insect gene <b>order,</b> these mitogenomes all contain a tRNA rearrangement. To gain new insights into Lepidoptera mitogenome evolution, we sequenced the mitogenomes of two ghost moths that belong to the non-ditrysian lineage Hepialoidea and conducted a comparative mitogenomic analysis across Lepidoptera. Results The mitogenomes of Thitarodes renzhiensis and T. yunnanensis are 16, 173 [*]bp and 15, 816 [*]bp long with an A[*]+[*]T content of 81. 28 [*]% and 82. 34 [*]%, respectively. Both mitogenomes include 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and the A[*]+[*]T-rich region. Different tandem repeats in the A[*]+[*]T-rich region mainly account for the size {{difference between the two}} mitogenomes. All the protein-coding genes start with typical mitochondrial initiation codons, except for cox 1 (CGA) and nad 1 (TTG) in both mitogenomes. The anticodon of trnS(AGN) in T. renzhiensis and T. yunnanensis is UCU instead of the mostly used GCU in other sequenced Lepidoptera mitogenomes. The 1, 584 -bp sequence from rrnS to nad 2 was also determined for an unspecified ghost moth (Thitarodes sp.), which has no repetitive sequence in the A[*]+[*]T-rich region. All three Thitarodes species possess the <b>ancestral</b> gene <b>order</b> with trnI - trnQ - trnM located between the A[*]+[*]T-rich region and nad 2, which is different from the gene order trnM - trnI - trnQ in all previously sequenced Lepidoptera species. The formerly identified conserved elements of Lepidoptera mitogenomes (i. e. the motif ‘ATAGA’ and poly-T stretch in the A[*]+[*]T-rich region and the long intergenic spacer upstream of nad 2) are absent in the Thitarodes mitogenomes. Conclusion The mitogenomes of T. renzhiensis and T. yunnanensis exhibit unusual features compared with the previously determined Lepidoptera mitogenomes. Their <b>ancestral</b> gene <b>order</b> indicates that the tRNA rearrangement event(s) likely occurred after Hepialoidea diverged from other lepidopteran lineages.

However, to date, limited data are available as taxon sampling is narrow.

Based on these sequences, we investigated the gene rearrangement in these two species and the relationships {{with respect to the}} <b>ancestral</b> gene <b>order</b> and assessed their phylogenetic relationships. Methods The complete mt genomes of R. swinhoei and P. corneus were sequenced using Illumina-based paired-end sequencing and annotated by comparing the sequence information with that of related gastropod species. Putative models of mitochondrial gene rearrangements were predicted for both R. swinhoei and P. corneus, using Reishia clavigera mtDNA structure as the <b>ancestral</b> gene <b>order.</b> The phylogenetic relationships were inferred using thirteen protein sequences based on Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses. Results The complete circular mt genome sequences of R. swinhoei and P. corneus were 14, 2410 bp and 13, 6870 bp in length, respectively. Comparison of the gene order demonstrated complex rearrangement events in Gastropoda, both for tRNA genes and protein-coding genes. The phylogenetic analyses showed that the family Lymnaeidae was more closely related to the family Planorbidae, consistent with previous classification. Nevertheless, due to the position recovered for R. swinhoei, the family Lymnaeidae was not monophyletic.

The sizes of the seven genomes vary from 116, 459 to 129, 498 bp, and their genomes are compact and lack introns. The larger size of the plastid genomes of Thalassiosirales compared to other diatoms is due primarily to expansion of the inverted repeat. Gene content within Thalassiosirales is more conserved compared to other diatom lineages. Gene order within Thalassiosirales is highly conserved except for the extensive genome rearrangement in Thalassiosira oceanica. Cyclotella nana, Thalassiosira weissflogii and Roundia cardiophora share an identical gene order, which is inferred to be the <b>ancestral</b> <b>order</b> for the Thalassiosirales, differing from that of the other two Cyclotella species by a single inversion.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{recent study}} by Tadepally et al. {{describes}} the clustering of zinc finger (ZF) genes in the human genome and traces their evolutionary history among several placental mammals with complete or draft genome sequences. One of the main conclusions from the paper {{is that there is}} a dramatic rate of gene duplication and gene loss, including the surprising result that 118 human ZF genes are absent in chimpanzee. The authors also present evidence concerning the <b>ancestral</b> <b>order</b> in which the ZF-associated KRAB and SCAN domains were recruited to ZF proteins. Results Based on our analysis of two of the largest human ZF gene clusters, we find that nearly all of the human genes have plausible orthologs in chimpanzee. The one exception may be a result of the incomplete sequence coverage in the draft chimpanzee genome. The discrepancy in gene content analysis may result from the authors' dependence on the preliminary NCBI gene prediction set for chimpanzee, which appears to either fail to predict or to mispredict many chimpanzee ZF genes. Similar problems may affect the authors' interpretation of the more divergent dog, mouse, and rat ZF gene complements. In addition, we present evidence that the KRAB domain was recruited to ZF genes before the SCAN domain, rather than the reverse as the authors suggest. This discrepancy appears to result from the fact that the SCAN domain did indeed arise before the KRAB domain but is present only in non-ZF genes until a much later date. Conclusion When comparing gene content among species, especially when using draft genome assemblies, dependence on preliminary gene prediction sets can be seriously misleading. In such studies, genic sequences must be identified in a manner that is as independent as possible of prediction sets. In addition, we present evidence that provides a more parsimonious explanation for the large proportion of mammalian KRAB-ZF genes without a SCAN domain. </p...|$|R
