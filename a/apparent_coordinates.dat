The system uses video cameras to obtain {{views of the}} linear accelerator, and the live images are displayed on a monitor in the treatment room.

The augmented monitor can then be viewed, and alignment performed against the virtual contour. The system provides an intuitive method for set-up guidance, and allows non-rigid de-formations to patient pose to be visualised.

40|$|It is well known, {{that the}} {{analysis}} of variation of radio-sources coordinates in time is overwhelmingly important, since they can affect seriously the precision and accuracy of the CRF {{as well as the}} precision and accuracy of the nutation and Universal Time estimations obtained from the processing of VLBI observations. Up to now, four commonly used stability criteria based on different schemes have been used for the reference radiosources selection. Four lists of reference radio sources based on these schemes have been compiled. But significant inconsistencies between these lists were found. In this paper we tried to analyze an impact of these different selection schemes on the CRF solution as well as on radio source coordinate time-series.

40|$|Our {{previous}} {{studies have indicated that}} TGF-β 1 and VEGF expression are increased in the smooth muscle cell (SMC) layer of the pulmonary vessels of lambs with pulmonary hypertension secondary to increased pulmonary blood flow. Further we found that TGFβ 1 expression increased prior to VEGF. Due to the increased blood flow in the shunt lambs the SMC in the pulmonary vessels are exposed to increased levels of the mechanical force, cyclic stretch. Thus, in this study, using primary cultures of pulmonary arterial SMCs (PASMCs) isolated from pulmonary arteries of 4 week-old lambs, we investigated the role of cyclic stretch in the <b>apparent</b> <b>coordinated</b> regulation of TGF-β 1 and VEGF. Our results demonstrated that cyclic stretch induced a significant increase in VEGF expression both at the mRNA and protein levels (P< 0. 05). The increased VEGF mRNA was preceded by both an increased expression and secretion of TGF-β 1 and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In addition, a neutralizing antibody against TGF-β 1 abolished the cyclic stretch-dependent increases in both superoxide generation and VEGF expression. Our data also demonstrated that cycli...|$|R
40|$|Gfi- 1 B, {{expressed}} predominantly in hematopoietic tissues, encodes a novel {{zinc finger}} protein that binds DNA {{in a sequence}} specific manner and represses transcription. During the search for its role in hematopoietic cell differentiation, we found that IL- 6 induced G 1 arrest and differentiation of the myelomonocytic cell line M 1 {{was linked to the}} downregulation of Gfi- 1 B and the parallel induction of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p 21 WAF 1. Experiments addressing the potential mechanism of the <b>apparent</b> <b>coordinate</b> regulation of these genes revealed that Gfi- 1 B repressed p 21 WAF 1 directly by binding to a high affinity site at - 1518 to - 1530 in the p 21 WAF 1 promoter. Forced expression of Gfi- 1 B blocked the IL- 6 -mediated induction of p 21 WAF 1 and inhibited G 1 arrest and differentiation. We therefore conclude that Gfi- 1 B is a direct repressor of the p 21 WAF 1 promoter, the first such repressor identified to date, and that abrogation of the Gfi- 1 B-mediated repression of the p 21 WAF 1 promoter is required for IL- 6 induced differentiation of M 1 cells. ...|$|R

40|$|Gfi- 1 is a {{cellular}} proto-oncogene that {{was identified as}} a target of provirus integration in T-cell lymphoma lines selected for interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) independence in culture and in primary retrovirus-induced lymphomas. Gfi- 1 encodes a zinc finger protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor. Here we show that Gfi- 1 B, a Gfi- 1 related gene expressed in bone marrow and spleen, also encodes a transcriptional repressor. IL- 6 -induced G 1 arrest and differentiation of the myelomonocytic cell line M 1 were linked to the downregulation of Gfi- 1 B and the parallel induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p 21 WAF 1. Experiments addressing the potential mechanism of the <b>apparent</b> <b>coordinate</b> regulation of these genes revealed that Gfi- 1 B represses p 21 WAF 1 directly by binding to a high-affinity site at − 1518 to − 1530 in the p 21 WAF 1 promoter. Forced expression of Gfi- 1 B, but not of Gfi- 1 B deletion mutants lacking the repressor domain, blocked the IL- 6 -mediated induction of p 21 WAF 1 and inhibited G 1 arrest and differentiation. We conclude that Gfi- 1 B is a direct repressor of the p 21 WAF 1 promoter, the first such repressor identified to date, and that sustained expression of Gfi- 1 B blocks IL- 6 -induced G 1 arrest and differentiation of M 1 cells perhaps because it prevents p 21 WAF 1 induction by IL- 6...|$|R
40|$|Leptin is {{a hormone}} that regulates body weight by {{decreasing}} food intake and increasing energy expenditure. ob/ob mice carry leptin mutations and are obese and hyperphagic. Leptin administration to lean and ob/ob mice activates a novel metabolic program that depletes adipose tissue. Although this response is physiologically distinct from that evident after food restriction, the molecular {{nature of these}} differences is as yet unknown. Expression monitoring of 6500 genes using oligonucleotide microarrays in wild-type, ob/ob, and transgenic mice expressing low levels of leptin revealed that differences in ambient leptin levels have dramatic effects on the phenotype of white adipose tissue. These data identified {{a large number of}} genes that are differentially expressed in ob/ob mice. To delineate the components of the transcriptional program specifically affected by leptin, the level of the same 6500 genes was monitored in wild-type and ob/ob mice at various times after leptin treatment or food restriction. A novel application of k-means clustering identified 8 clusters of adipose tissue genes whose expression was different between leptin treatment and food restriction in ob/ob mice and 10 such clusters in wild-type experiments. One of the clusters was repressed specifically by leptin in both wild-type and ob/ob mice and included several genes known to be regulated by SREBP– 1 /ADD 1. Further studies confirmed that leptin decreases the levels of SREBP– 1 /ADD 1 RNA and transcriptionally active SREBP– 1 /ADD 1 protein in white adipose tissue. Future studies of the molecular basis for the <b>apparent</b> <b>coordinate</b> regulation of the other clusters of leptin-regulated genes may reveal additional mechanisms by which leptin exerts its weight-reducing effects...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the expression of key regulatory molecules of bone remodeling in the trabecular bone microenvironment in osteoporosis. Bone samples were taken from the intertrochanteric region of the proximal femur of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty for a subcapital fragility fracture of the femoral neck (#NOF). For comparison, samples were taken from age-matched control individuals at routine autopsy. Expression of RANKL, RANK, osteoprotegerin (OPG), IL- 6, IL- 11, osteocalcin (OCN), and calcitonin receptor (CTR) messenger RNA (mRNA) species were analyzed and the data were nonparametrically distributed. The median expression of the proresorptive genes, RANK and IL- 6, were significantly elevated in the fracture group compared to an age-matched control group (2. 2 [1. 9 – 2. 9; 25 th– 75 th percentiles] > 1. 0 [0. 4 – 2. 1], P 0. 8 [0. 7 – 1. 5], P 3. 2 [2. 1 – 4. 0], P < 0. 05). IL- 6 mRNA levels associated strongly with RANKL mRNA levels in the #NOF group (r = 0. 77, P < 0. 001), but not in the control group. A strong positive association was found between IL- 11 mRNA levels and RANKL mRNA levels in the #NOF group (r = 0. 81, P < 0. 001), consistent with the <b>apparent</b> <b>coordinated</b> regulation of IL- 6 and IL- 11 in bone samples from the #NOF group (r = 0. 93, P < 0. 0001).

40|$|The {{coordination}} of the syntheses {{of the several}} cellular lipid classes {{with one another and}} with cell cycle control were investigated in proliferating L 6 myoblasts and fibroblasts (WI- 38 and CEF). Cells cultured in lipid-depleted medium containing one of two inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, 25 -hydroxycholesterol or compactin, display a rapid, dose-dependent inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. Inhibition of the syntheses of each of the other lipid classes is first apparent after the rate of sterol synthesis is depressed severalfold. 24 h after the addition of the inhibitor, the syntheses of DNA, RNA, and protein also decline. The inhibition of sterol synthesis leads to a threefold reduction in the sterol:phospholipid ratio that parallels the development of proliferative and G 1 cell cycle arrests and alterations in cellular morphology. All of these responses are reversed upon reinitiation of cholesterol synthesis or addition of exogenous cholesterol. A comparison of the timing of these responses with respect {{to the development of the}} G 1 arrest indicates that the primary factor limiting cell cycling is the availability of cholesterol provided either from an exogenous source or by de novo synthesis. The G 1 arrest appears to be responsible for the general inhibition of macromolecular synthesis in proliferating cells treated with 25 -hydroxycholesterol. In contrast, the <b>apparent</b> <b>coordinated</b> inhibition of lipid synthesis is not a consequence of the G 1 arrest but may in fact give rise to it. Sequential inhibition of lipid syntheses is also observed in cycling cells when the synthesis of choline-containing lipids is blocked by choline deprivation and is observed in association with G 1 arrests caused by confluence or differentiation. In the nonproliferating cells, the syntheses of lipid and protein do not appear coupled...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the characterisation {{of a set}} of six genes of the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that are induced when a molasses-grown culture reaches the end of rapid fermentative growth. The rationale for the isolation of such genes was that their promoters may be useful in a biotechnological application, where the regulated expression of heterologous proteins is required. Additionally, their analysis should provide information about how yeast cells adapt to changing environmental situations. Therefore the aims of this project were to identify the unknown members of this set of genes and to determine the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms acting on all six. Six cDNA clones, which showed differential hybridisation to mRNAs of exponential and stationary phase cells, were used as probes to recover the cognate genes from a library of yeast genomic DNA fragments carried in the bacteriophage vector, EMBL 3. Two had been identified as the previously described genes, HSP 26 and HXKl encoding the 26 kDa heat shock protein and the glucose-repressible hexokinase, respectively. A further two, previously undescribed genes, encode a second small, 12 kDa, stress-induced protein (HSP 12) and a thiamine biosynthetic enzyme (THI 4). DNA sequence analysis carried out in this study has characterised the two remaining genes as HXT 4 =LGT 1, a low affinity hexose transporter and a new thiamine regulated gene, THI 5. Transcription of these six genes has been examined under a variety of growth conditions and in various mutant backgrounds. The two heat-shock genes, HSP 12 and HSP 26, are subject to glucose control via a cAMP-dependent protein kinase and become induced when the cells experience stress or starvation; presumably they have a role in maintaining the integrity of the cell under these conditions. The genes involved in hexose metabolism, HXKl and HXT 4, are regulated by glucose repression through the TUP 1 /CYC 8 /SNF 1 pathway and are derepressed by exhaustion of glucose from the growth medium; their products enable the cell to utilise alternative hexoses as growth substrates. Both of the thiamine genes, THI 4 and THI 5, are subject to repression by exogenous thiamine and become derepressed on depletion of the vitamin from the growth medium. Thus, although these genes show <b>apparent</b> <b>coordinate</b> induction they are regulated via different transcriptional control mechanisms. DNA sequence analysis revealed the THI 5 gene to encode a second thiamine biosynthetic enzyme homologous to the product of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene nmtl. THI 5 is present within the yeast genome in multiple copies located on chromosomes VI (THI 5), X (THI 11) and XIV (THI 12).

Evidence indicates that: (1) The orientation resulting from the migration of the lysosome-like vesicles is transient and may not determine any lasting polarity of the epithelial cell. The sequential migration of the lysosome-like vesicles first to the epithelial cell to cell interface, then to the basal margin and finally to the apical margin of the epithelial cell was coincident with and apparently in response to the presence of cell debris often trapped at these sites. The Lysosome-like vesicles formed tight clusters along the epithelial cellular margins where phagocytosis of cell debris and resorption of specialized structures occurred. In contrast, the mesenchyme cell had smaller numbers of phagosomes and lysosome-like vesicles and was observed to participate to a more limited degree in phagocytosis and resorption. (2) The orientation resulting from the formation of a leading edge during the migration of the epithelial cell is transient. The sequence of cytological events associated with epithelial cell migration included the formation of: (a) hyaloplasmic blebs along the cell free margin; (b) filopodia and microvilli; and (c) lamellae with a number of lamellipodia at the leading edge. In contrast, the mesenchyme cell formed filopodia on a smaller scale and was observed to participate in migration only to a limited degree. Coincident with the cessation of epithelial cell migration was the enlargement of the lamella between the epithelial cells into a hyaloplasmic sheet which forms the blastocoel wall. Embryonic cells from reassembling aggregates were cultured as monolayers on glass treated with an adhesion enhancing factor derived from the incubation medium. Cords of cells, composed of both epithelial and mesenchyme cells migrate away from the aggregate and leave in their wake clusters of cells. Epithelial cells were found at the leading margins of these cell cords and were observed forming cytoplasmic blebs, filopodia and hyaloplasmic leading edges during the migration of the cell cord. No <b>apparent</b> <b>coordinate</b> orientation was detectable within the epithelial cells of the migrating cell cord or stationary cell cluster. A hypothesis is presented suggesting a role for resorption during epithelial cell migration. (3) Cell contacts formed during reaggregation become more adhesive as development proceeds. The sequence of fine structural events associated with cell contact formation include the formation of (a) a non [...] junctional cell apposition, which was characterized by parallel apposed membranes; (b) an incipient continuous junction, which was characterized by parallel apposed membranes; and (c) a continuous junction, which was characterized by the presence of an electron dense region both superjacent and subjacent to the plasma membrane {{at the site of the}} junction. The cell appositions between premigratory cells were easier to disrupt mechanically than the later forming continuous junctions. The forming continuous junction was first focal in extent and later zonal in girth around the apical margin of the epithelial cell. Concurrent with the formation of the strongly adhesive continuous junction by the lamella was a cessation of epithelial cell migration, followed by an expression of an apical-basal polarity within the epithelial cell. A hypothesis is presented suggesting a role for cell contacts during the coordinated orientation of the epithelia during the formation of the blastocoel wall...|$|R
40|$|AbstractÐThe postsynaptic {{effects of}} {{acetylcholine}} in the striatum are largely mediated by muscarinic receptors. Two of the ®ve cloned muscarinic receptors (M 1 and M 4) are expressed {{at high levels}} by the medium spiny neuronsÐthe principal projection neurons of the striatum. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} M 4 muscarinic receptors are found primarily in medium spiny neurons that express substance P and participate in the ªdirectº striatonigral pathway. This view is dif®cult to reconcile with electrophysiological studies suggesting that nearly all medium spiny neurons exhibit responses characteristic of M 4 receptors. To explore this <b>apparent</b> discrepancy, the <b>coordinated</b> expression of M 1 ±M 5 receptor messenger RNAs in identi®ed medium spiny neurons was assayed using single-cell reverse transcription±polymerase chain reaction techniques. Nearly all medium spiny neurons had detectable levels of M 1 receptor messenger RNA. Although M 4 receptor messenger RNA was detected more frequently in substance P-expressing neurons (70 %), it was readily seen in a substantial population of enkephalin-expressing neurons (50 %). To provide a quantitative estimate of transcript abundance, quantitative reverse transcription±polymerase chain reaction experiments were performed. These studies revealed that M 4 messenger RNA was expressed by both substance P and enkephalin neurons, but was roughly ®ve-fold higher in abundance in substanc...|$|R
40|$|Cataclysmic Binaries are semi-detached {{binaries}} {{consisting of}} a white dwarf or a white dwarf precursor primary and a low-mass secondary which is filling its critical Roche lobe. The secondary is not necessarily unevolved, {{it may even be}} a highly evolved star as for example {{in the case of the}} AM CVn-type stars. Low-Mass X-Ray Binaries are semi-detached binaries consisting of either a neutron star or a black hole primary, and a low-mass secondary which is filling its critical Roche lobe. Related Objects are detached binaries consisting of either a white dwarf or a white dwarf precursor primary and of a low-mass secondary. The secondary may also be a highly evolved star. The catalogue lists <b>coordinates,</b> <b>apparent</b> magnitudes, orbital parameters, stellar parameters of the components and other characteristic properties of 522 cataclysmic binaries, 75 low-mass X-ray binaries and 117 related objects with known or suspected orbital periods together with a comprehensive selection of the relevant recent literature. In addition the catalogue contains a list of references to published finding charts for 695 of the 714 objects. A cross-reference list of alias object designations concludes the catalogue. Literature published before 31 December 2003 has, as far as possible, been taken into account.

40|$|We {{examined}} the connections of posterior parietal cortex (PPC) with motor/premotor cortex (M 1 /PM) and other cortical areas. Electrical stimulation (500 ms trains) delivered to microelectrode sites evoked movements of reach, defense, and grasp, from distinct zones in M 1 /PM and PPC, in squirrel and owl monkeys. Tracer injections into M 1 /PM reach, defense, and grasp zones showed dense connections with M 1 /PM hand/forelimb representations. The densest inputs outside of frontal cortex were from PPC zones. M 1 zones were additionally connected with somatosensory hand/forelimb representations in areas 3 a, 3 b, and 1 and the somatosensory {{areas of the}} upper bank of the lateral sulcus (S 2 / PV). Injections into PPC zones showed primarily local connections and the densest inputs outside of PPC originated from M 1 /PM zones. The PPC reach zone also received dense inputs from cortex caudal to PPC, which likely relayed visual information. In contrast, the PPC grasp zone was densely connected with the hand/forelimb representations of areas 3 a, 3 b, 1, and S 2 /PV. Thus, the dorsal parietal [...] frontal network involved in reaching was preferentially connected to visual cortex, whereas the more ventral network involved in grasping received somatosensory inputs. Additional weak interlinks between dissimilar zones (e. g., PPC reach and PPC grasp) were <b>apparent</b> and may <b>coordinate</b> actions...|$|R
40|$|Aims: We {{develop a}} method for {{deriving}} distances from spectroscopic data and obtaining full 6 D phase-space coordinates for the RAVE survey's second data release. Methods: We used stellar models combined with atmospheric properties from RAVE (effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity) and (J - Ks) photometry from archival sources to derive absolute magnitudes. In combination with <b>apparent</b> magnitudes, sky <b>coordinates,</b> proper motions {{from a variety of}} sources and radial velocities from RAVE, we are able to derive the full 6 D phasespace coordinates for a large sample of RAVE stars. This method is tested with artificial data, Hipparcos trigonometric parallaxes and observations of the open cluster M 67. Results: When we applied our method to a set of 16 146 stars, we found that 25 % (4037) of the stars have relative (statistical) distance errors of 4), 25 % (1744) have relative distance errors < 31 %, while 50 % (3488) and 75 % (5231) have relative errors smaller than 36 % and 42 %, respectively. Our full dataset shows the expected decrease in the metallicity of stars as a function of distance from the Galactic plane. The known kinematic substructures in the U and V velocity components of nearby dwarf stars are apparent in our dataset, confirming the accuracy of our data and the reliability of our technique. We provide independent measurements of the orientation of the UV velocity ellipsoid and of the solar motion, and they are in very good agreement with previous work. Conclusions: The distance catalogue for the RAVE second data release is available at [URL] and will be updated in the future to include new data releases. © 2010 ESO. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Reproductive {{inefficiency}} in cattle has major {{impacts on}} overall productivity of cattle operations, increasing cost of production, and impacting {{the sustainability of}} the cattle enterprise. Decreased reproductive success and associated disease states have been correlated {{with the presence of}} specific microbes and microbial community profiles, yet details of the relationship between microbial communities and host physiology are not well known. The present study profiles and compares the microbial communities in the bovine uterus and vagina using 16 S rRNA sequencing of the V 1 –V 3 hypervariable region at the time of artificial insemination. Significant differences (p < 0. 05) between the vaginal and uterine communities were observed at the level of α-diversity metrics, including Chao 1, Shannon’s Diversity Index, and observed OTU. Greater clustering of vaginal OTU was <b>apparent</b> in principal <b>coordinate</b> analysis compared to uterine OTU, despite greater diversity in the vaginal community in both weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance matrices (p < 0. 05). There was a significantly greater relative abundance of unassigned taxa in the uterus (p = 0. 008), otherwise there were few differences between the overall community profiles. Both vaginal and uterine communities were dominated by Firmicutes, although the relative abundance of rRNA sequences corresponding to species in this phylum was significantly (p = 0. 007) lower in the uterine community. Additional differences were observed at the genus level, specifically in abundances within Clostridium (p = 0. 009), Anaerofustis (p = 0. 018), Atopobium (p = 0. 035), Oscillospira (p = 0. 035), 5 - 7 N 15 (p = 0. 035), Mycoplasma (p = 0. 035), Odoribacter (p = 0. 042), and within the families Clostridiaceae (p = 0. 006), Alcaligenaceae (p = 0. 021), and Ruminococcaceae (p = 0. 021). Overall, the comparison revealed differences and commonalities among bovine reproductive organs, which may be influenced by host physiology. The increased abundance of unassigned taxa found in the uterus may play a significant biological role in the reproductive status of the animal. The study represents an initial dataset for comparing bacterial communities prior to establishment of pregnancy...|$|R
