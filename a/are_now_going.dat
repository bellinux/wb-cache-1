2500|$|International {{changes have}} {{affected}} shipping through the Seaway. Europe {{is no longer}} a major grain importer; big US export shipments <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>going</b> to South America, Asia and Africa. These destinations make Gulf and West Coast ports more critical to 21st-century grain exports. Referring to the Seaway project, a retired Iowa State University economics professor who specialized in transportation issues said, [...] "It probably did make sense, at about the time it (the Seaway) was constructed and conceived, but since then everything has changed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Independent {{analyses}} of the documents {{by a number of}} U.S. academics and journalists have challenged the Colombian interpretation of the documents, accusing the Colombian government of exaggerating their contents. According to Greg Palast, the claim about Chavez's $300 million is based on the following (translated) sentence: [...] "With relation to the 300, which from now on we will call 'dossier', efforts <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>going</b> forward at the instructions of the cojo , which I will explain in a separate note." [...] The separate note is allegedly speaking of a hostage exchange with the FARC that Chavez was supposedly helping to negotiate at that time. Palast suggests that the [...] "300" [...] is supposedly a reference to [...] "300 prisoners" [...] (the number involved in a FARC prisoner exchange) and not [...] "300 million".|$|E
