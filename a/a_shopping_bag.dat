The Chicago press stated that this solidified the case against Heirens. Subgrunski's testimony helped to return an indictment. Before the trial, inconsistencies in his original statement had led many to dismiss his evidence. Later, Subgrunski's in court testimony was discredited when it was pointed out that in contrast to his original statement that he could not see the man's features because there was no light, at trial he testified that he was certain because Heirens had walked in front of the car [...] "in the full glare of his headlights." ...|$|E
