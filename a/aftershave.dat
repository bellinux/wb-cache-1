2500|$|Limonene {{is common}} in {{cosmetic}} products. As the main odor constituent of citrus (plant family Rutaceae), d-limonene is used in food manufacturing and some medicines, e.g. as a flavoring to mask the bitter taste of alkaloids, and as a fragrance in perfumery, <b>aftershave</b> lotions, bath products, and other such products that include fragrance. d-Limonene is also used as botanical insecticide. d-Limonene {{is used in the}} organic herbicide [...] "Avenger." [...] It is added to cleaning products, such as hand cleansers to give a lemon-orange fragrance (see orange oil) and for its ability to dissolve oils. In contrast, l-limonene has a piney, turpentine-like odor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Abstract — Aim: To {{identify}} {{the composition of}} illegal and surrogate alcohol products consumed in Estonia. Methods: The initial source of information {{was a series of}} visits made in August 2005 to a soup kitchen in central Tartu, Estonia. Individuals were asked for brief details of their personal circumstances, what they normally drank, and in addition they were asked to bring samples of the substances they usually consumed. In other cases, the substances identified were purchased by the investigators or from informal con-tacts in north-eastern part of Estonia, an area that is well known for illegal alcohol consumption. Samples were tested for chemical con-tents. Results: We identified a range of alcohol-containing substances that are consumed, although, not intended for consumption. These comprised medicinal products, <b>aftershaves,</b> illegally produced spirits, and fire-lighting fuel. The medicinal compounds contained, on average, 67 % ethanol by volume; the <b>aftershaves</b> contained slightly less. Both were typically pure, with a few containing detectable quantities of isoamyl alcohol. The illegally produced alcohol contained, on average, 43 % ethanol by volume, ranging from 32 to 53 %. However, many also contained detectable quantities of long chain alcohols. These substances are half the price or less of commercial vodka, with fire lighting fuels especially inexpensive. Conclusions: There is in Estonia a range of alcohol-containing substances easily available at low cost. Some contain substantially higher concentrations of ethanol than commercial spirits and others also contain toxic long chain alcohols...|$|R

2500|$|The two Osella cars, who had {{not taken}} part in any running on Friday did compete on Saturday, {{following}} a decision by team owner Enzo Osella to loan the cars and drivers to his sponsors, Denim <b>Aftershave.</b> The cars were entered by a team named after the sponsor, which Osella believed would avoid any sanctions against the Osella teams' licence, and {{in a bid to}} keep up the pretense, Osella was also not present in the pitlane. The Saturday qualifying session took place in hotter temperatures, which meant that cars were approximately half-a-second slower per lap than they had been on Friday. [...] In this second session, Williams driver Alan Jones switched to his spare car and improved on his Friday time, which secured him second position on the grid and displaced Pironi to third and Reutemann to fourth. The guaranteed qualification meant that this was the only race in the 1980 season where both cars entered by the Shadow team would start a race.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aftershave</b> is {{sometimes}} mistakenly {{referred to as}} eau de cologne due to the very similar nature of the two products. Some <b>aftershave</b> manufacturers encourage using their fragranced <b>aftershave</b> {{as if it were}} cologne, in order to increase sales by encouraging consumers to use it in a more versatile manner, rather than just after a shaving session. Some aftershaves were inspired by a cologne.|$|E
50|$|Appointed to {{a senior}} {{lecturer}} post in 1989 with responsibility for developing a program of research in Europe, he was immediately confronted with two major changes: {{the collapse of the}} communist regimes in central and eastern Europe and, later, in the USSR, and the removal of borders within the expanding European Union. He has led major programs on both issues. With his colleagues Professor David Leon and Vladimir Shkolnikov, he has contributed important new insights into the adverse health consequences of rapid social and political transition, the entry of the international tobacco corporations into these new markets, and the role of alcohol, and especially substances such as <b>aftershaves</b> (odekolon) in the high levels of premature mortality seen in this region. More recently, his work on social change has extended into a large body of research on the health effects of the post-2007 financial crisis, jointly with Dr David Stuckler. His research on the European Union has been equally broad, including books and articles on the impact of European law on health and health policy, European research policy, and cross-border mobility of patients. In 2013 he led a Lancet series on health in Europe.|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{is important}} in mate choice in many species and can be appraised via multiple traits in any one individual. Thus, one {{question that arises is}} whether sexual dimorphism in different traits influences preferences consistently. Here, we examined human preferences for masculinity/femininity in different types of stimuli. For face and body stimuli, images were manipulated to be more or less masculine using computer graphic techniques. Voice stimuli were made more or less masculine by manipulating pitch. For smell, we used variation among male <b>aftershaves</b> as a proxy for manipulating masculinity of real male smell and used relatively masculine/feminine odors. For women, we found that preferences for more masculine stimuli were greater for short-term than for long-term relationships across all stimuli types. Further analyses revealed consistency in preferences for masculinity across stimuli types, at least for short-term judgments, whereby women with preferences for masculinity in one domain also had preferences for masculinity in the other domains. For men, we found that preferences for more feminine stimuli were greater for short-term than for long-term judgments across face and voice stimuli, whereas the reverse was true for body stimuli. Further analyses revealed consistency in preferences for masculinity across stimuli types for long-term judgments, whereby men with preferences for femininity in one domain also had preferences for femininity in the other domains. These data suggest that masculinity/femininity as a trait may be assessed via different modalities and that masculinity/femininity in the different modalities might be representing a single underlying quality in individuals. © 2011 The Author...|$|R

While in Paris, after beating France in the Five Nations, England {{teammate}} Maurice Colclough emptied {{a bottle of}} free <b>aftershave</b> from the after-match meal, filled it with wine, and drank from it. Thinking that Colclough had drunk the <b>aftershave</b> {{and not wanting to}} appear upstaged by his teammate, Smart drank his bottle of <b>aftershave.</b> This made him very ill. After England medical officer Leo Walkden failed to get a response from Smart, he was required to go to hospital to have his stomach pumped. The incident was alluded to a month later, after England had beaten Wales, by Steve Smith who quipped: [...] "The <b>aftershave</b> will sure taste good tonight!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Both men {{and women}} use perfume to boost their sexual {{attractiveness}} {{to members of the}} opposite, or same sex. Indeed, when we find that one perfume or <b>aftershave</b> that works for us, we're hard-pressed to change it - perfume can be as much of our personality as our personal style or likes and dislikes. Olfactory communication is completely natural in humans: we don't always realise we've detected people's particular scents when we have. Without perfume or <b>aftershave,</b> we unconsciously detect people's natural scents: in the form of pheromones. Pheromones are usually detected unconsciously, and it is believed that they have an important influence on our social and sexual behaviour [...] Logically then, it follows on that our choice of perfume or <b>aftershave</b> influences how sexually attractive we are. Do we choose perfume regardless of our natural scent (as dictated mainly by pheromones) or do we choose to douse ourselves in scents we prefer, regardless of our natural odour? There are a number of hypotheses concerning why we wear perfume or <b>aftershave,</b> and whether it amplifies or reduces our natural scents.|$|E
