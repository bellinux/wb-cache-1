Behind her a number is painted on the wall; when the feed's web counter reaches the painted number, a masked man appears and cuts the girl's throat.

5|$|Although {{opinions}} {{differ on}} whether the Bala Kanda narrative of Ahalya refers to the divinity of Rama, later sources assert Rama's divine status, portraying Ahalya as a condemned woman rescued by God. The Bhakti-era poets use the episode as an archetypal example to demonstrate God's saving grace. The main theme of such narratives is her deliverance by Rama, which is seen <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> his compassion.|$|E
5|$|The state seal is {{maintained}} by the Governor of Indiana. It is used to certify the authenticity of official state documents. The seal is placed on departmental reports, bills the Governor signs into law, and official communications from the Governor to other high-ranking office holders.

5|$|Written by Roger Dixon, {{this story}} was {{submitted}} in early 1967. A race of people were wiped out by powerful robots that they created. The robots having become so advanced that they are then {{able to create a}} new race of people. The robots then fear that these new humans will dominate them, and when the Doctor arrives on their planet, they take this <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> their fears.|$|E
5|$|After a {{preliminary}} investigation, Geetha calls Georgekutty and family for questioning. Georgekutty, who had predicted {{that this would}} happen, had already taught his family how to change their alibi {{at the time of}} murder. When questioned individually, they give the same replies. Georgekutty also presents the bill of the restaurant, the movie ticket and the bus tickets <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> their alibi. Geetha questions the owners of the establishments they have been to and their statements prove Georgekutty's alibi. However, Geetha realizes later that Georgekutty had faked the evidence and established his alibi on the owners by going on a trip with his family to the same establishments later.|$|E
5|$|Burr {{was quickly}} called to Canada's Naval Services Headquarters {{to discuss how}} to apply {{diffused}} lighting camouflage. Simple tests in the laboratory served <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> concept. In January 1941, sea trials began on the new corvette HMCS Cobalt. She was fitted with ordinary light projectors—neither designed for robustness, nor waterproofed—on temporary supports {{on one side of}} the hull; brightness was controlled manually. The trial was sufficiently promising for a better prototype to be developed.|$|E

5|$|First World {{commentators}} {{had already}} speculated that Brezhnev had {{died when he}} failed to sign a message of congratulations to José Eduardo dos Santos, the President of Angola, for the Angolan Independence Day. This was a breach of protocol, and, as Brezhnev had earlier signed messages to all Soviet-aligned heads of state, the absence of his signature was seen as suspicious. The delay in declaring the death of Brezhnev was seen by some First World commentators <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> the ongoing power struggle in the Soviet leadership over who would succeed him. Konstantin Chernenko {{was seen as the}} most likely candidate to succeed Brezhnev.|$|E
5|$|Later discoveries {{turned up}} {{a large number of}} excised clips, held by {{interested}} parties <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> the edits. In October 1996, Australian Doctor Who fans Damian Shanahan and Ellen Parry discovered a collection in the records of the National Archives of Australia, provided as evidence by the Commonwealth Film Censorship Board (now the Classification Board). These clips include The Smugglers, episodes 1, 3-4; The Highlanders, episode 1; The Underwater Menace, episodes 2, 4; The Macra Terror, episode 3; Fury From The Deep, episodes 2, 4-5; and The Wheel In Space, episode 4.|$|E
5|$|Mathematically, the {{smallest}} possible object that could possess an absolute magnitude of +1 (a perfectly reflective {{one with an}} albedo of 1) would be 838km in diameter.

5|$|More recent performances, led by {{conductors}} Pierre Boulez, Edo de Waart and Sixten Ehrling, {{have been}} acknowledged {{to show the}} music in a more positive light. Nevertheless, the overall reputation of the music remains mixed. Some critics, including composer John Adams, have remained critical {{of the work and}} considered Copland's use of serial techniques detrimental to his later music. Others, which include critics Michael Andrews and Peter Davis, have seen Connotations <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> Copland's continued growth and inventiveness as a composer while not downplaying the work's melodic and harmonic harshness and potential difficulty overall for listeners.|$|E
5|$|The dozen {{fans who}} worked on the project had been vetted by Mandelin and had prior {{localization}} experience. Thousands of hours were put into the project between hacking the game data and translating the 1,000 pages of scripted dialogue. They built their own tools for the work. The final version was released in October 2008 and issued as a patch. The patch was downloaded over 100,000 times in its first week. A fan-made, full-color, 200-page, professional-quality player's guide was released alongside the translation. The Verge cited the effort <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> the fan base's dedication.|$|E
5|$|To {{put an end}} to the deadlock, Gaddafi {{proposed}} on 30 April {{a mutual}} withdrawal of both the French and Libyan forces in Chad. French President François Mitterrand showed himself receptive to the offer, and on 17 September the two leaders publicly announced that the mutual withdrawal would start on 25 September, and be completed by 10 November. The accord was at first hailed by the media <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> Mitterrand's diplomatic skill and a decisive progress towards the solution of the Chadian crisis; it also demonstrated Mitterrand's intent of following a foreign policy independent from both the US and the Chadian government regarding Libya and Chad.|$|E

5|$|A {{design team}} {{was formed in}} 1946 under the {{leadership}} of chief designer Ronald Bishop, who had been responsible for the Mosquito fighter-bomber. A number of unorthodox configurations were considered, ranging from canard to tailless designs; all were subsequently rejected. The Ministry of Supply was, however, interested in the most radical of the proposed designs and ordered two experimental tailless DH 108s to serve <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> concept aircraft for testing swept-wing configurations in both low-speed and high-speed flight. During flight tests, the DH 108 gained a reputation for being accident-prone and unstable, leading de Havilland and BOAC to gravitate to conventional configurations and, necessarily, designs with less technical risk. The DH 108s were later modified to test the DH 106's power controls.|$|E
5|$|Ahalya's {{seduction}} by Indra and its repercussions {{form the}} central narrative {{of her story}} in all scriptural sources for her life. Although the Brahmanas (9th to 6th centuries BCE) are the earliest scriptures to hint at her relationship with Indra, the 5th- to 4th-century BCE Hindu epic Ramayana– whose hero is Rama– {{is the first to}} explicitly mention her extra-marital affair in detail. Medieval story-tellers often focus on Ahalya's deliverance by Rama, which is seen <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> the saving grace of God. Her story has been retold numerous times in the scriptures and lives on in modern-age poetry and short stories, as well as in dance and drama. While ancient narratives are Rama-centric, contemporary ones focus on Ahalya, telling the story from her perspective. Other traditions deal with her children.|$|E

Bond and Jones enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb, and Jones discovers that half of the plutonium is missing. They both jump clear of the rig, a large section of pipeline is destroyed, and they are presumed killed. Back at the command centre, Elektra reveals she and Renard are conspirators and that she killed her father as revenge for using her as bait for Renard. She abducts M, whom she resents for advising her father not to pay the ransom money, and imprisons her in the Maiden's Tower.|$|E
5|$|Born in Oslo in 1864 to a Norwegian {{father and}} an English mother, Carsten Borchgrevink emigrated to Australia in 1888, {{where he worked}} on survey teams in the {{interior}} before accepting a provincial schoolteaching appointment in New South Wales. In 1894 he joined a commercial expedition, led by Henryk Bull in the whaler Antarctic, which penetrated Antarctic waters and reached Cape Adare, the western portal to the Ross Sea. A party including Bull and Borchgrevink briefly landed there and {{claimed to be the}} first men to set foot on the Antarctic continent—although the American sealer John Davis believed he had landed on the Antarctic Peninsula in 1821. They also visited Possession Island in the Ross Sea, leaving a message in a tin box <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> their journey. Borchgrevink was convinced that the Cape Adare location, with its huge penguin rookery providing a ready supply of fresh food and blubber, could serve as a base at which a future expedition could overwinter and subsequently explore the Antarctic interior.|$|E
5|$|By law, a valid unexpired Lebanese {{passport}} or Identity card (Arabic: بطاقة الهوية (transl.

The Lebanese law does not prohibit Lebanese citizens from holding passports of other countries, though {{they are required to}} use their Lebanese passport to enter and leave the country. An expired Lebanese passport can still be used to return to the Republic of Lebanon at any port and port personnel are obliged by law to allow the passage of the bearer without any delay or hindrance.
