50|$|The {{gasoline}} (petrol) engine pioneer Gottlieb Daimler and Maybach built a four-cycle boat {{engine and}} tested it in 1887 on the Neckar River. Sintz in America built several commercially available engines from 1893. About 1895 the inboard oil engine emerged for small boats. From this, {{hundreds of small}} boat engine manufactures set up shop: Bolinder, Gray Marine Engine, Kermath, Union Iron Works, Caille, Palmer, Red Wing, St. Lawrence, and Buda; Sulzer, B and W, Gardner, and Ailsa Craig to mention a few. Two-stroke engines were popular for many years, however, the parallel development of the <b>auto</b> <b>engine,</b> with their many cylinders, became a natural transposition.

5000|$|A tornado which slashed {{through a}} three-block {{downtown}} {{area of the}} city killed three people. At least 55 others were injured, including 15 who were hospitalized. The twister's winds were so forceful that a 15-foot wooden plank was driven through an <b>auto</b> <b>engine</b> block, splitting {{the front of the}} car in two. The twister hit this central Illinois community of 15,000 during the early evening and decimated the business district, severed electrical power and gas lines, and sheared off roofs and uprooted scores of trees. It also overturned numerous automobiles and blew out hundreds of windows. Initial reports from the Illinois State Police placed the number of dead at four, but a spokesman said, [...] "Early confusion probably accounted for duplicated reports." [...] The area hit by the tornado included city square and another block farther south, and also caused extensive damage elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|In 1923, at age 21, Sunnen {{applied for}} his first of nearly 100 patents, a valve lifter tool, marking the {{beginnings}} of Sunnen Company. However that same year he was nearly killed in a work explosion which burnt most of his body, and spent a year recovering. He returned to his brother's garage for employment and while in Mexico, Missouri, met and married Miss Cornelia Miller.https://web.archive.org/web/20110718203122/http://www.ja.org/nested/stlouis/Sunnen.pdf They moved to St. Louis to pursue Sunnen's manufacturing ambitions in 1924. There Sunnen converted a 1916 Hupmobile into a camper and {{set out on the}} road to sell 500 of his new valve lifter tools. They sold two or three tools a day until they reached Mankato, Minnesota where a large distributor of shop tools bought his remaining stock and placed an order for 1,000 additional tools.

5000|$|The 431-cubic-inch {{displacement}} 1938-40 Cadillac V16 {{was one of}} {{the last}} new American <b>auto</b> <b>engine</b> designs prior to World War Two. As such, it incorporated some of the latest thinking. Nine main bearings provided a crankshaft main bearing support between each 135 degree opposing pair of cylinders. The square bore and stroke lowered piston speed and promoted crankshaft rigidity, no small matter for an engine with eight cylinders in line per cylinder bank. The side valve engine design was no handicap for the time because the era's typical top engine speed of 3400-3700 rpm provided little opportunity to exploit the high speed breathing efficiency of overhead valves. Luxury car drivers presumably valued smoothness and silence more than high speed power. Hydraulic valve lifters promoted silent running and an absence of periodic adjustment. Unlike most cars of the era, an external oil filter safeguarded the precision valve lifters. Despite the use of side valves, the engine produced as much power as the prior 45 degree V16, and with much less complexity. The earliest engines produced featured an innovative friction wheel drive to the generator. This was soon replaced by a conventional V belt drive. Cadillac claimed that the 1938, 1939, and 1940 Series 90 Sixteen had the best performance of any production car in the world at the time and would accelerate 10-60 in high gear only in 16 seconds. The definitive engineering report on the 135 degree Cadillac V16 engine is [...] "The Evolution of the Cadillac Sixteen engine," [...] by E.W. Seaholm, in charge of Cadillac engine design. It was published by the industry journal [...] "Automotive Industries," [...] November 27, 1937.|$|E
