A music video for [...] "Running to the Edge of the World" [...] was also released, which was {{condemned}} as a perceived glorification {{of violence against}} women. The band, which featured former Wired <b>All</b> <b>Wrong</b> member Andy Gerold on bass, toured {{in support of the}} record. While promoting the release, Manson made a series of disparaging comments about Interscope, its artistic censorship, as well as its-then CEO Jimmy Iovine. It was the band's final album released by the label.|$|E

'I only lasted five to 10 seconds, {{and the sound}} of my voice crying out to stop isn't me acting.' Pal, that's nice that you're not showing off but this is <b>all</b> <b>wrong</b> and despicable: it's like locking yourself and 10 friends into a loo on a commuter train, to see {{what it would be like}} on the train to Auschwitz.

500|$|... "It wasn't a {{question}} of doing everything differently, although they changed the ending; it was mostly a matter of doing everything wrong. They said the lines...mostly...but they said them <b>all</b> <b>wrong.</b> And they cast it wrong. And they designed it wrong. And they scored it wrong. They did everything wrong that they could possibly do. There's actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking, because everything that they did reflects back to the script or looks like something from the script, and people assume that, if I hated it, then they’d changed the script...but it wasn’t so much that they’d changed the script; it’s that they just executed {{it in such a}} ghastly fashion as to render it almost unwatchable." ...|$|E

500|$|The High End of Low {{was made}} {{available}} for streaming on the band's Myspace profile four days before its US release. The album was supported by [...] "The High End of Low Tour". Rob Holliday did not rejoin the band, with Twiggy taking over on lead guitar and former Wired <b>All</b> <b>Wrong</b> member Andy Gerold performing bass. The tour was visually inspired by the art of cinematography production, and featured cinema-derived stage lighting. Manson removed the distinction between on- and off-stage, with stagehands reapplying the band members' make-up and assisting with wardrobe changes in full-view of the audience. Prior to the commencement of each song, a stagehand would re-appear and signify that a new act had begun by using a clapperboard in front of Manson.|$|E
500|$|Syro is an {{electronic}} music album. All 12songs {{on the album}} were written by James in-studio. According to James, the songs were written over an extended period; Syro features both archived and more recent compositions, with the album's oldest track around [...] "six or seven years old". The album was recorded in six different studios, including James' own studio in Scotland, which he spent three years building and which was completed in 2006. One audio engineer spent three months with James, helping him wire together patch panels and [...] "then [...] realized {{he was doing it}} <b>all</b> <b>wrong</b> and had to start again". Describing the overall process as [...] "brutal", James referred to the in-studio technical issues as the catalyst for writing new music that would be featured on Syro.|$|E
500|$|Much of Connor's {{development}} in season {{three and four}} is his continuous shifting alliances between protagonists and antagonists; {{he is unable to}} find his place or his purpose for being. Jeffrey Bell says that all the confusing and conflicting circumstances never allow Connor a break, which he thinks [...] "makes him empathetic in midst of making <b>all</b> <b>wrong</b> choices". Steven S. DeKnight says: [...] We really wanted to highlight [...] that he is a tragic victim of circumstance. He never had a childhood, he's been lied to and manipulated and in this episode we find out his whole reason for being was to bring this other thing into this world, so he's been played his entire life. You really root for him to make the right decision in this one, but you know tragic figure he doesn't.|$|E

500|$|Guilty Men was not {{the only}} Second World War tract that damaged Chamberlain's reputation. We Were Not <b>All</b> <b>Wrong,</b> {{published}} in 1941, took a similar tack to Guilty Men, arguing that Liberal and Labour MPs, and a small number of Conservatives, had fought against Chamberlain's appeasement policies. The author, Liberal MP Geoffrey Mander, had voted against conscription in 1939. Another polemic against Conservative policies was Why Not Trust the Tories (1944, written by [...] "Gracchus", who later proved to be future Labour minister Aneurin Bevan), which castigated the Conservatives for the foreign policy decisions of Baldwin and Chamberlain. Though a few Conservatives offered their own versions of events, most notably MP Quintin Hogg in his 1945 The Left was Never Right, {{by the end of the}} war, there was a very strong public belief that Chamberlain was culpable for serious diplomatic and military misjudgments that had nearly caused Britain's defeat.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the eighth}} series, Last Broadcast held a poll for the top five most {{shocking}} death scenes in Spooks. Two of them were deaths from the seventh series. Adam Carter's death was voted the fourth most shocking, while Ben Kaplan's death was voted third. Connie's death however, was not listed. The featuring of an actual waterboarding scene drew criticism from Guardian columnist Zoe Williams, who wrote [...] "it's really unpleasant, [...] concurred. 'I only lasted five to 10 seconds, and the sound of my voice crying out to stop isn't me acting.' Pal, that's nice that you're not showing off but this is <b>all</b> <b>wrong</b> and despicable: it's like locking yourself and 10 friends into a loo on a commuter train, to see {{what it would be like}} on the train to Auschwitz.

500|$|Her family made a {{down payment}} on their own home in Humboldt Park, a {{predominantly}} Puerto Rican neighborhood on Chicago's West Side when she was eleven years old. This neighborhood and its characters would later become the inspiration for Cisneros's novel The House on Mango Street. For high school, Cisneros attended Josephinum Academy, a small Catholic all-girls school. Here she found an ally in a high-school teacher who helped her to write poems about the Vietnam War. Although Cisneros had written her first poem around the age of ten, with her teacher's encouragement she became known for her writing throughout her high-school years. In high school she wrote poetry and was the literary magazine editor, but, according to herself, she did not really start writing until her first creative writing class in college in 1974. After that it took a while to find her own voice. She explains, [...] "I rejected what was at hand and emulated the voices of the poets I admired in books: big male voices like James Wright and Richard Hugo and Theodore Roethke, <b>all</b> <b>wrong</b> for me." ...|$|E

500|$|On March 13, 2006, Hayes {{announced}} that he was quitting the show because of the series' treatment of religion, saying, [...] "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins. Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices." [...] The Guardian observed that Hayes did not specifically mention Scientology in his statement. Later in an interview on CNN's Showbiz Tonight, Hayes added he did not see the episode itself, but was told about it. In a separate interview, he reportedly said regarding Parker and Stone, [...] "Guys, you have it <b>all</b> <b>wrong.</b> We're not like that. I know that's your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know? But I understand what they're doing.

500|$|In {{spite of}} playing the second half against Wimbledon with ten men after the {{dismissal}} of Luzhny, Arsenal defeated their London rivals by three goals to one. Before the game away to Leeds United on 16 April 2000, both clubs observed a minute's silence to honour the two Leeds fans who were murdered in Istanbul. Wenger and his players then presented bouquets of flowers to their counterparts. Arsenal went ahead in the 21st minute – Henry beat defender Jonathan Woodgate for pace and scored his 20th goal of the season. Further goals by Keown, Kanu and Overmars resulted in a 4–0 win and lifted Arsenal above Leeds into third, with a better goal difference. Arsenal beat Watford and continued their strong finish to {{the season with a}} 1–0 win at Everton to move into second place. Wenger believed Manchester United, who retained their status as champions in April, had benefited from the league being [...] "organised" [...] in their favour: [...] "They had a winter break. They didn't play in the FA Cup. It was <b>all</b> <b>wrong</b> from the start. The break was good for them because {{at the same time we}} dropped points and so did the other teams. So when they came back they had the psychological advantage." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{dismissal}} of Daryll Cullinan in 1999 {{was the second}} instance in ODIs: facing the West Indian spinner Keith Arthurton, Cullinan fended the ball off into the ground. It bounced high in the air, and Cullinan removed his right hand from his bat to catch it as it fell again. Despite {{the fact that it}} was unlikely that the ball would land near the stumps, the West Indies captain, Brian Lara, appealed, and Cullinan was dismissed. The next occurrence was two years later, in a Test match between Australia and India. In the first innings of the match, Steve Waugh was struck on the pads by a delivery from Harbhajan Singh. The umpire turned down the appeal, but as he did so, the ball bounced and spun towards the stumps. Waugh was alerted by a shout from the non-striking batsman, and instinctively swept the ball away with his free hand. The most recent instance came during the same year as Waugh's dismissal, in another Test match involving India. England's Michael Vaughan missed an attempted sweep against Sarandeep Singh, and the ball trickled along the ground after striking his pads. Vaughan brushed the ball away with his hand, despite {{the fact that it was}} not travelling towards the stumps. Initially, he claimed that he was attempting the give the ball back to the fielder at short leg, but he later admitted that he [...] "should have just held up [...] hands and said 'I got it <b>all</b> <b>wrong,</b> I'm an idiot.'" ...|$|E
