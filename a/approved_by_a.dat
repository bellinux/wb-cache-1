5|$|Assemblies and councils {{operated}} {{according to}} established procedures {{overseen by the}} augurs. They could only be convened by magistrates, and citizens only voted on matters proposed by the presiding magistrate. Over the years, laws were passed which mandated a written ballot, attempted to reduce voter intimidation, and established procedures to watch over voting and prevent voter fraud. For elections, {{it was not a}} matter of who received the most votes, but rather who could first be <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> majority of the voting blocs. All votes had to be completed within a single day and had to be done again if interrupted or abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Membership in B'nai Israel was {{restricted}} to men, and attendance at the (at least) quarterly meetings was mandatory. Men who missed a meeting without a reasonable excuse were fined. The members also instituted rules intended to guard {{the image of the}} small Jewish congregation {{in the eyes of the}} much larger Christian community. New members had to be <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> secret ballot, and existing members could blackball candidates. A member could also be suspended or expelled if he acted in a disreputable manner.|$|E
5|$|The Commission {{is divided}} into {{departments}} known as Directorates-General (DGs) that can be likened to departments or ministries. Each covers a specific policy area such as Agriculture or Justice and citizens' rights or internal services such as Human Resources and Translation and is headed by Director-General who is responsible to a Commissioner. A Commissioner's portfolio can be supported by numerous DGs, they prepare proposals for them and if <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> majority of Commissioners it goes forward to Parliament and Council for consideration. The Commission's civil service is headed by a Secretary General, currently Alexander Italianer. The rules of procedure of the European Commission set out the Commission's operation and organisation.|$|E

Any amendment to the Constitution must first be passed by a majority {{in each of the}} two legislative houses.

5|$|Although the {{compromise}} passed the Senate in March 1970, it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who {{was determined to}} end silver in the coinage. The Senate passed the bill again in September, this time attaching it as a rider to a bank holding company bill sought by Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half dollar and to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> conference committee and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that as Congress had adjourned, not signing the bill would pocket veto it, Nixon hastily signed it just before midnight on December 31, 1970, only minutes before the deadline.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{aggressive}} tactics of Haywood and the IWW, {{along with their}} call for abolition of the wage system and the overthrow of capitalism created tension with moderate electorally-oriented leaders of the Socialist Party. Haywood and the IWW focused on direct action and strikes, which often led to violence, and were less concerned with political tactics. When Haywood was quoted speaking at public meetings in New York City {{to the effect that}} he had never advocated the use of the ballot by the workers but had instead favored the tactics of direct action, an initiative recalling Haywood from the NEC was launched by the State Executive Committee of the Socialist Party of New York. In February 1913 the recall of Haywood was <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> margin of more than 2-to-1. Following his defeat, Haywood left the ranks of the Socialist Party, joined by thousands of other IWW members and their sympathizers.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, Meir Abergil {{was freed}} and {{returned}} to Israel after having served about {{three years in prison}} first in Israel and then in the United States. Charged with blackmailing U.S. businessmen to whom the brothers had lent money, he allegedly had played a relatively minor role in the crimes and is thought to have been involved mainly in the extortion of Asi Vaknin, who was arrested in Mexico and brought to the United States in April 2011, but refuses to testify against the Abergils. As a result, U.S. authorities reportedly were not able to build a case against Meir Abergil, leading to a plea agreement <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> California court in which Abergil confessed to extortion of over a million dollars from another mob figure. In Israel, he faces criminal charges pending against him in the district court in Petah Tikva over allegations regarding his involvement in an Internet gambling business set up about 10 years ago which operated in many locations in Israel, including Internet cafes, convenience stores, soccer lottery outlets and nightclubs functioning as casinos. According to his lawyer, Abergil′s involvement in the alleged activities was marginal.|$|E
5|$|The {{referendum}} {{that was}} held to adopt the state symbols took place on May 14, 1995. With a voter turnout of 64.7%, the new flag was <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> majority in the ratio of three to one (75.1% to 24.9%). The other three questions were also passed by the voters. The way of carrying out the referendum {{as well as the}} legality of questioning the national symbols on a referendum was heavily criticized by the opposition. Opposition parties claimed that only 48.7% of the entire voting population (75.1% of the 64.7% who showed at the polling stations) supported the adoption of the new flag, but Belarusian law (as in many other countries) states that only a majority of voters is needed to decide on a referendum issue. Upon the results going in favor of President Lukashenko, he proclaimed that the return of the Soviet-style flag brought a sense of youth and pleasant memories to the nation.|$|E

5|$|The tercentenary of {{the capture}} of Gibraltar was celebrated in the {{territory}} in August 2004 but attracted criticism from some in Spain. In September 2006, tripartite talks between Spain, Gibraltar and the UK resulted in a deal (known as the Cordoba Agreement) {{to make it easier}} to cross the border and to improve transport and communications links between Spain and Gibraltar. Among the changes was an agreement to lift restrictions on Gibraltar's airport to enable airlines operating from Spain to land there and to facilitate use of the airport by Spanish residents. It did not address the vexed issue of sovereignty, but this time the government of Gibraltar supported it. A new Constitution Order was promulgated in the same year, which was <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> majority of 60.24% in a referendum held in November 2006.|$|E
