At age 3 months, children display joint attention skills by calling to a caregiver when they are not perceivable.

500|$|By early 2009, {{business}} analysts Lonsec Agribusiness Research considered Great Southern to {{be financially}} stressed, {{and that it}} was [...] "hard to envisage a rapid turnaround in the outlook" [...] for the company. They gave Great Southern as managers the second-lowest rating on their <b>assessment</b> <b>scale,</b> just short of stating that the investment would be [...] "detrimental to an investor's...portfolio". Great Southern's banks refused a request in 2009 for a further $35million loan. Great Southern's attempts to extract itself from financial trouble were unsuccessful and by May 2009, when a trading halt was called, the company's shares were worth just 12 cents. On 16 May 2009 administrators were appointed under the Corporations Act 2001, with the companies' assets passing into control of receivers McGrathNicol on 18 May 2009. The assets of the group were primarily its land holdings. By the time it went into administration, they were valued at A$1.8 billion, however, despite company expansion plans, its net assets had not grown for four years.|$|E
40|$|Risk <b>assessment</b> <b>scales</b> {{are widely}} {{used to measure the}} risk of {{pressure}} ulcers in the clinical area. They have been subject to many validation studies; however these have focused on the predictive ability of the scales. We have conducted several studies that consider the validity of pressure ulcer risk <b>assessment</b> <b>scales.</b> We have reviewed these and revisited the data in some cases to conduct additional tests of validity presented {{for the first time in}} this paper. Based on these results, and a review of the literature, we have come to the conclusion that while the scales are probably reliable, and do assess risk: 1. Many of the components of risk <b>assessment</b> <b>scales</b> are not predictive of pressure ulcers 2. There are other variables that are routinely available to clinicians that give additional predictive power 3. The importance of components is not accurately reflected by their range of values 4. Components are correlated and some components may be removed with no loss of predictive power 5. There is no evidence the use of risk <b>assessment</b> <b>scales</b> reduces pressure ulcer incidence The complexity of risk <b>assessment</b> <b>scales</b> does not appear to be warranted. There is evidence that clinical judgment is as effective in assessing risk as risk <b>assessment</b> <b>scales.</b> Reduction in pressure ulcer incidence after implementation of risk assessment tools is likely to be an example of the Hawthorn effect. We believe risk <b>assessment</b> <b>scales</b> are useful research tools, but may not be useful in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|Aim: A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} feasibility of functional <b>assessment</b> <b>scales</b> regarding completion rate and ability to document functional changes in geriatric rehabilitation patients. Methods: Five functional <b>assessment</b> <b>scales</b> were implemented, and used on admission and discharge as part of standard care. Results: Of 2, 812 patients, 90 patients (3. 2 %) had no scales administered, 2, 330 patients (82. 9 %) had between one and six scales administered and 392 (13. 9 %) had a complete data set (seven scales). The percentage of inpatients who were independent or almost independent in basic ADL functions improved from 30 % to 60 % during hospitalization; 53 % had cognitive impairment, while 19 % expressed depressive thoughts or depression on admission. Conclusion: Functional <b>assessment</b> <b>scales</b> were feasible in the clinical routine, gave important information on patients' functional status at baseline, and showed that patients improved their physical function considerably during hospitalization.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} was to describe symptom <b>assessment</b> <b>scales</b> {{that have been used}} in children with cancer. Methods We conducted electronic searches of OVID Medline and EMBASE in order to identify all symptom <b>assessment</b> <b>scales</b> that have been used in pediatric cancer. Two reviewers abstracted information from each identified study. Data collected included study demographics and information related to the instrument and children enrolled. We also collected information about the purpose of instrument administration and whether treatment was altered {{as a result of this}} information. Results Fourteen studies were identified which evaluated eight different symptom <b>assessment</b> <b>scales.</b> Eight studies used child self-report and all studies included children on active treatment for cancer although 4 studies also included children following completion of treatment. The most common purpose of instrument administration was to measure the prevalence of symptom burden (n[*]=[*] 8). None of the 14 studies used the scale to screen for symptoms and none changed patient management on the basis of identified symptoms. Conclusions We failed to identify any symptom <b>assessment</b> <b>scales</b> that were used as a symptom screening tool. There is a need to develop such a tool for use in children with cancer. </p...|$|R

40|$|Aims and objectives. To {{consider}} {{the validity and}} reliability of risk <b>assessment</b> <b>scales</b> for pressure ulcers. Background. Pressure ulcers are a major problem worldwide. They cause morbidity and lead to mortality. Risk <b>assessment</b> <b>scales</b> have been available for nearly 50 years, but there is insufficient evidence to state with any certainty that they are useful. Design. A literature review and commentary. Methods. Bibliographic databases were searched for relevant papers, a critical review was completed on relevant papers. Results. There is contradictory evidence concerning the validity of risk assesment scales. The interaction of education, clinical judgement and use of risk assessment sakes has not been fully explored. It is not known which of these is most important, nor whether combining them results in better patient care. Conclusions. There {{is a need for}} further work. A study exploring the complex interaction of risk <b>assessment</b> <b>scales,</b> clinical judgement and education and training is introduced. Relevance to clinical practice. Nurses may be wasting their time conducting risk assessment scoring if clinical judgement and/or education are sufficient to assess pressure ulcers risk...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{translate}} and test the psychometric properties of the Norwegian-language version of the Risk <b>Assessment</b> Pressure Sore <b>scale.</b> Background. Risk <b>assessment</b> <b>scales</b> for pressure ulcer prevention have become an aspect of quality improvement in healthcare, but their effectiveness depends on the reliability and validity of the scale. Methods. A convenience sample of 481 residents in 15 nursing homes in rural Norway was included between January and June 2007. The English-language version of the Risk <b>Assessment</b> Pressure Sore <b>scale</b> was translated into Norwegian, and this scale was used to collect the data, including a skin examination. The number of pressure ulcers and grades were documented. Reliability was assessed in a small group of 26 residents and construct validity in the total study group. Results. Equivalence between two assessments regarding total scores of the Risk <b>Assessment</b> Pressure Sore <b>scale</b> was reflected in an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0. 95. Construct validity was supported, and the Risk <b>Assessment</b> Pressure Sore <b>scale</b> could define groups with expected low and high scores.
