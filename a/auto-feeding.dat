5000|$|The Dragonfly {{building}} is 575 m high, shaped as firefly wings. It {{is composed of}} two towers related by a 'bio-climatic' glasshouse. It deploys itself between two crystalline wings made out of glass and steel. The structure in honeycomb stitch allows the sunlight {{to pass through the}} building. This concept is seen as a feeder farm and reconnects the consumers with producers. This prototype of urban farm would have superimposed 132 floors and estending 600 m vertically with garden vegetables, fields, production of meat, milk, poultry and eggs where people could grow their own food. The Dragonfly can accommodate 28 different agricultural fields for the production. It is self-sufficient in energy, water and bio-fertilizing, powered by sunshield and eolian systems. These combine solar and wind power, which would make the Dragonfly self-sufficient.Everything is recyclable in a continuous <b>auto-feeding</b> so that nothing is lost. The spaces between the wings are designed to take advantage of solar energy by accumulating warm air in the structure during winter. During the summer it is cooling which is facilitated through natural ventilation and [...] "evapo-perspiration" [...] from the plants.|$|E

IEEE Consumer Electronics SocietyThe {{design of}} yoke feeding {{system is a}} great {{challenge}} in {{the progress of the}} T 90 core riveting machine design because of the specific structure of T 90 relay' yoke. We designed a feeding system for the T 90 core riveting machine in this article, including the program design of the feeding system and the design of the <b>auto-feeding</b> vibration plate, the yoke pushing component and the finger cylinder component. Finally we successfully solved the difficulty of the yoke feeding system for the T 90 core riveting machine. ? 2011 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades the {{development}} of new satellite platforms from a smaller to a bigger size goes in parallel with the development of the microelectronics equipment boarded on. Avionics, control systems and payloads equipment exploit the microelectronics {{in order to reduce the}} overall dimensions and masses and to increase the performances of each unit for the improvement of goals in each mission. A larger use of electronic elements with the relevant components increases the importance of a carefully equipment designed under different points of view. One of them is the thermal management. It is well known that the Joule Effect causes the heat overstocking which in turn reduces the efficiency of the electronic devices and increases the difficulties to manage the thermal power budget on board. A new design philosophy sees a possibility for a simpler and a more efficient thermal control on the use of the pyroelectric materials. Pyroelectrics are a "special" class of materials that demonstrates a spontaneous capacity to convert thermal fluxes in electrical charge and if applied on a "passive" structure they can "actively" reduce the heat overstocking. The electrical charge could be eventually stored for different purposes such as for instance the <b>auto-feeding,</b> or better the energy harvesting. With the reduction of the temperature of each component, and consequently with the reduction of the heat flux that flows through microelectronics, better efficiency and better performances are ensured. In this way the reliability is increased and the goals of the mission could be achieved easier and easier. In this paper the design of a thermal rig made up of pyroelectric devices and dummy electronics components in order to verify the thermo-electric conversion is presented. Furthermore an experimental campaign has been performed to validate the technology here introduced and the relevant results presented. In particular the characterisation of a typical aerospace pyroelectric material via scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a semi-quantitative analysis will be discussed. In order to verify the trustworthiness of the experimental campaign the results will be compared with the ones coming from an in-house-developed numerical code. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|As {{the robot}} is {{designed}} to be controlled and operated by the primary surgeon, this experiment is conducted in a manual-control mode. The objective of this experiment is similar to the <b>auto-feed</b> one, i.e., to verify the performance of the robot in responding to the userâ€™s input commands.|$|R

The reversible feed system allows the newer style drum chippers to handle larger diameter materials. Modern drum-style chippers usually have a material capacity of 6 to 20 inches (15-50 cm).|$|R
50|$|There are {{two general}} {{thermoforming}} process categories. Sheet thickness less than 1.5 mm (0.060 inches) is usually {{delivered to the}} thermoforming machine from rolls or from a sheet extruder. Thin-gauge roll-fed or inline extruded thermoforming applications are dominated by rigid or semi-rigid disposable packaging. Sheet thicknesses greater than 3 mm (0.120 inches) are usually delivered to the forming machine by hand or an <b>auto-feed</b> method already cut to final dimensions. Heavy, or thick-gauge, cut sheet thermoforming applications are primarily used as permanent structural components. There is {{a small but growing}} medium-gauge market that forms sheet 1.5 mm to 3 mm in thickness.|$|R
