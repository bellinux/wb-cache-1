5|$|Declared {{the winner}} by Sakamochi, Shogo is escorted to his {{transport}} off the island, surrounded by soldiers. Sakamochi, however, reveals {{that he knows}} Nanahara and Nakagawa are alive and that his supposed execution of Noriko and Shuya was a ruse after he {{found a way to}} disable their collars, and attempts to kill Shogo. Shogo kills him as a hidden Nanahara and Nakagawa hijack the ship and kill the soldiers on board. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> sails towards the mainland, Shogo succumbs to his wounds sustained during the hijacking, and dies, but not before thanking Shuya and Noriko for being his friends.|$|E
5|$|A major {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} bridge in August 1931. The paddle steamer E.R.O. struck the lift span of the bridge. The span had not been raised to a high enough level, causing it to clip {{the top of the}} steamer's funnel and rip apart the upper deck. High pressure steam was released during the accident causing some onlookers to believe the boat was on fire. It was at first thought the captain would be found amongst the wreckage of the upper deck, but he had been navigating the boat from the lower deck at that time. The captain displayed considerable skill; he immediately realised that further raising of the span despite being given the all clear meant it was not quite high enough. And through his actions <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> progressed downstream caught in the current, he prevented the boat becoming stuck at the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Following his birth, Nemo {{develops}} a smaller right fin due to {{damage to his}} egg, which limits his swimming ability. Worried about Nemo's safety, Marlin embarrasses Nemo during a school field trip. Nemo disobeys his father and sneaks away from the reef towards a boat, and is captured by scuba divers. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> departs, a diver accidentally knocks his diving mask overboard. While attempting to save Nemo, Marlin meets Dory, a good-hearted and optimistic regal blue tang with short-term memory loss. Marlin and Dory meet three Australian sharks– Bruce, Anchor and Chum– who claim to be vegetarians. Marlin discovers the diver's mask and notices an address written on it. When he argues with Dory and accidentally gives her a nosebleed, the blood causes Bruce to lose control of himself and enter a violent feeding frenzy. The pair escape from Bruce, but the mask falls into a trench in the deep sea.|$|E
60|$|They re-embarked without opposition, first {{releasing}} a few prisoners, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> could not carry them.|$|R

50|$|Many {{adjustments}} {{can be made}} to {{the equipment}} to accommodate the physiques of the crew. Collectively these adjustments are known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat's</b> rigging.|$|R
5|$|The British arrival was {{reportedly}} greeted with derision by the French sailors, until a boarding party clambered onto the frigate from Bedfords deck, {{to be met}} by resistance from the French crew. Mann then ordered his ship's Royal Marines to fire into the French sailors, killing several and driving many more over the side into the harbour. This attack broke their resolve and the French surrendered, several leaping into the sea to escape capture, only to be collected by the boats of Captain. As Modeste was subdued, the boats of Speedy approached the tartanes. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> parties boarded the small French warships, the crew of one surrendered while the other resisted the British boarders. A short melee broke out {{on the deck of}} the tartane, resulting in the captain and one other French sailor wounded and the tartane firmly in British hands. The raid completed, the British squadron withdrew from Genoa with their prizes. British sources reported that one French sailor had been killed in the operation and ten wounded, while the British boarding parties had survived unscathed, while French sources claimed five killed and 30 wounded or in the most extreme accounts, as many as 50 killed.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in the UK, Gjems-Onstad joined the Norwegian Independent Company 1 (Kompani Linge) and took British military education. The British decided in 1943 to deploy him to Trøndelag in Norway together with Odd Sørli, Johnny Pevik and Nils Uhlin Hansen. The deployment was necessary as Evald Hansen and Herluf Nygaard had been captured and tortured in December 1942 (Nygaard later escaped, Hansen died at Falstad). Sørli and Gjems-Onstad were set to maintain Lark, establish radio connection with London and get intelligence about the German battleship Tirpitz, at the time located in the Trondheimsfjord. When he was training at Glen More Lodge near Aviemore, Gjems-Onstad was ordered to go to London, where he was supplied with a 20kg radio transmitter and other equipment. Together with Sørli he travelled to Inverness by train, and to Shetland by plane, under stormy weather conditions. They initially set out with the fishing boat Harald II from Scalloway in late February, but due to unusually stormy weather they were driven back to Shetland three times after three unsuccessful attempts to reach Ålesund; the last attempt destroyed their equipment <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> was bursted open. They had their equipment replaced, and set out for Kristiansund in March instead on a bigger boat. With easier, yet still poor weather, the voyage took two days. When they reached land they noticed that they had reached Kya Lighthouse, much farther {{to the north of}} their original destination, but they decided to make landfall anyway. From there they travelled with fake identification via Namsos to Trondheim, where they reunited with fellow Lark members Johnny Pevik and Nils Uhlin Hansen, the other group sent from London. Gjems-Onstad thereafter assisted Pevik and Hansen with transporting five tons of weapons from an uninhabited island near Lyngvær to Trondheim.|$|E
25|$|The first 12 Metres {{were built}} in 1907. The 12 Metre class {{was used in the}} Olympic Games of 1908, 1912 and 1920 but few boats participated in these events. The 12 Metre class boats are best known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> design used in the America's Cup from 1958 to 1987.|$|E

5000|$|Boating {{activities}} are <b>as</b> varied <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> and boaters who participate, and {{new ways of}} enjoying the water are constantly being discovered. Broad categories include the following: ...|$|R
2500|$|Seventy-three persons {{submitted}} names, {{including three}} people who suggested [...] "Winema" [...] which a committee picked <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat's</b> name. Mrs. Jennings was selected to christen <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> by drawing her name from a hat containing {{the names of the}} three.|$|R
25|$|By 1874 the {{guano mining}} {{on the island}} has ceased, and a second cottage was built soon after. The residences were to be rebuilt twice more. The first time was {{sometime}} in the 1900s. A second time was in 1925 where three new cottages were built as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> shed and two more sheds for maintenance and storage.|$|E
25|$|Crewmen {{on board}} steamboats in the 1890s did not wear life-preservers. Drownings often {{occurred}} if they {{fell into the}} river. In late May, 1890, while Harvest Queen was coming upriver from Astoria to Portland, George P. Ward, of Portland, a watchman, was drowned when he was struck with a gang plank <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> was preparing for a landing and knocked into the river.|$|E
25|$|On {{reaching}} the water, lifeboat number 11 was nearly swamped by a {{jet of water}} being pumped out from the ship to stem the flooding. Tempers flared among the crowded passengers, {{some of whom had}} to stand, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> was rowed away from the ship. Rosenbaum offered some levity by using her musical pig to entertain the children underfoot. The lifeboat was met by Carpathia at about 7:00a.m.|$|E
50|$|The {{others in}} the study group are on <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> located in <b>the</b> Greendale parking lot and are greeted by Admiral Slaughter (Lee Majors). After {{discussing}} the rules, Admiral Slaughter appoints Shirley <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat's</b> Captain, much to Pierce's dismay.|$|R
5000|$|Seventy-three persons {{submitted}} names, {{including three}} people who suggested [...] "Winema" [...] which a committee picked <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat's</b> name.

60|$|He sprang nimbly ashore <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat’s</b> head touched <b>the</b> stairs, {{and after}} {{extending}} {{a hand to}} Mr. Chalk, which was coldly ignored, led {{the way up the}} steps to the quay.|$|R
25|$|On horse-drawn and mule-drawn canals, {{snubbing}} posts {{were used}} to slow or stop a boat in the lock. A 200-ton boat moving at a few miles an hour could destroy the lock gate. To prevent this, a rope was wound around the snubbing post <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> entered the lock. Pulling on the rope slowed the boat, due to the friction of the rope against the post. A rope 2½ inches (6.3cm) in diameter and about 60 feet (18 meters) long was typically used on the Erie Canal to snub a boat in a lock.|$|E
25|$|In operation, a boat is navigated {{into the}} {{carrying}} frame, {{which has been}} lowered into the water. The boat is secured to the cradle, possibly by raising slings under the hull using hydraulics, and the cradle is hauled {{out of the water}} and up the hill with a cable. At the top of the slope, the cradle is lowered into the upper waterway, and the boat released. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> is not floating, Archimedes' principle does not apply, so the weight lifted or lowered by the device varies – making counterbalancing (by dead weights or a second boat carriage) more difficult.|$|E
25|$|Laurentius {{was born}} Lars Persson in Örebro, Närke. Laurentius studied in Germany in 1520, {{possibly}} {{together with his}} brother. Here they took influence from Lutheranism, among other things they met with Martin Luther himself. On returning home to Stockholm, they got stranded and nearly lost their lives <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> went ashore {{on the island of}} Gotland. They both survived however, and settled on the island, and Laurentius became headmaster at a school while Olaus became assistant to a priest. Not long after, Olaus travelled with the priest to Stockholm and the crowning of King Gustav Vasa. Subsequently, he managed to get on friendly terms with the King, and soon moved to Stockholm where he worked {{in the vicinity of the}} King.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{need not}} {{ask if you}} have succeeded, Mr. Lyons," [...] <b>the</b> captain said, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> came up, [...] "for we have seen that. You have not had many casualties, I hope?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As soon <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> reached <b>the</b> {{water they}} were all {{pulled up to the}} {{starboard}} side, and then the helm was put down, and the barque came round till she was broadside on to us.|$|R
25|$|The {{mainstay}} of Ertebølle economy was fish. Three main methods of fishing {{are supported by}} <b>the</b> evidence, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> and other equipment found in fragmentary form at Tybrind Vig and elsewhere: trapping, angling and spearing.|$|R
25|$|On March 17, 1865, {{less than}} one month {{before the end of}} the war, he participated in a mission to attack Confederate forces in Mattox Creek, a {{tributary}} of the Potomac in Virginia. A boat equipped with a howitzer was launched from another ship of the Potomac Flotilla, the , and a group of seventy men was sent to follow along the river bank on foot. Anderson and a number of other black landsmen worked the oars on the boat, while Boatswain's Mate Patrick Mullen manned the howitzer and Ensign Summers acted as commander. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> and the accompanying foot soldiers made their way up the creek's right fork, the foot soldiers came under sporadic fire from snipers. Upon finding four small boats which had been abandoned by the Confederates, the soldiers on the river bank set about destroying them.|$|E
25|$|Those aboard Collapsible B {{suffered}} greatly {{during the}} night. The boat gradually sank lower {{into the water}} as the air pocket underneath it leaked away. The sea began to get up towards dawn, causing the boat to rock in the swell and lose more of its precious air. Lightoller organised {{the men on the}} hull to stand in two parallel rows {{on either side of the}} centreline, facing the bow, and got them to sway in unison to counteract the rocking motion caused by the swell. They were directly exposed to the freezing seawater, first up to their feet, then to their ankles and finally to their knees <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> subsided in the water. For some, the ordeal proved too much and one by one they collapsed, fell into the water and died. The victims possibly included John George Phillips, the first radio officer, and the third class passenger David Livshin, whose body was taken to the Carpathia on the following morning. About 30 people were left alive by the morning and were transferred into other lifeboats before being rescued by Carpathia.|$|E
25|$|On 7 September Brandenburg {{launched}} a Sea Lynx helicopter {{to perform a}} reconnaissance mission on a suspected skiff just south of Mukalla, Yemen. The Sea Lynx closed on and filmed five suspects on board the vessel throwing ladders and weapons overboard. The skiff was ordered to stop, but apparently refused to do so. An interpreter tried to convince the crew to stop, but to no avail. Then Brandenburg fired warning shots across her bow. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> continue undeterred, it was later known that the headquarters of Operation Atalanta authorized the German frigate to disable the skiff by gunfire. After the vessel was neutralized, a German Navy team from a Rigid-hulled inflatable boat {{took control of the}} crew and seized a number of weapons. One of the suspects was injured by gunfire during the incident, and later died of his wounds onboard Brandenburg while receiving medical treatment. This was the first fatality caused by the Bundeswehr in the course of Operation Atalanta. The weaponry found on board the skiff was later destroyed.|$|E
60|$|The {{order was}} given, {{and soon the}} ship was under a cloud of canvas, {{advancing}} slowly <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> towed her between two large icebergs, which had been gradually drawing near to each other the whole afternoon.|$|R
50|$|Drums and {{chanting}} are heard <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> come to headhunter territory. The vehicles pass a native village before sailing into an ambush by natives wielding spears, the sound effects for {{which are usually}} provided by the skipper.|$|R
60|$|Silently {{the party}} embarked, and <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> pushed {{off and the}} sailors from Sir Percy's yacht bent to their oars, the old Abbe Foucquet began gently droning a Pater and Ave {{to the accompaniment of}} his beads.|$|R
25|$|In a cafe, Ferrando and Guglielmo (two officers) express {{certainty}} that their fiancées (Dorabella and Fiordiligi, respectively) will be eternally faithful. Don Alfonso expresses skepticism and claims {{that there is}} no such thing as a faithful woman. He lays a wager with the two officers, claiming he can prove in a day's time that those two, like all women, are fickle. The wager is accepted: the two officers will pretend to have been called off to war; soon thereafter they will return in disguise and each attempt to seduce the other's lover. The scene shifts to the two women, who are praising their men (duet: Ah guarda sorella—"Ah look sister"). Alfonso arrives to announce the bad news: the officers have been called off to war. Ferrando and Guglielmo arrive, brokenhearted, and bid farewell (quintet: Sento, o Dio, che questo piede è restio—"I feel, oh God, that my foot is reluctant"). <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> with the men sails off to sea, Alfonso and the sisters wish them safe travel (trio: Soave sia il vento—"May the wind be gentle"). Alfonso, left alone, gloatingly predicts that the women (like all women) will prove unfaithful (arioso: Oh, poverini, per femmina giocare cento zecchini?—"Oh, poor little ones, to wager 100 sequins on a woman").|$|E
500|$|The event, {{subsequently}} {{referred to}} <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Boat</b> Race, or the University Boat Race, {{was held for}} a second time seven years later, in 1836 on the River Thames. [...] It was then held intermittently until the 1856 race after which it became an annual event, interrupted only by the First and Second World Wars. [...] As of 2017, 163 Boat Races have been contested; [...] Cambridge lead overall with 82 victories to Oxford's 80, excluding the one [...] "dead heat" [...] recorded in the 1877 race.|$|E
500|$|Mona briefly {{returned}} in [...] "How I Wet Your Mother", where she rescues {{the family in}} a dream of Homer's, saying that she lives on in his dreams. It is revealed in this episode {{that a couple of}} weeks before she left Homer as a child, Homer and Grampa went on a fishing trip that was unsuccessful <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> capsized. Homer would later feel guilt, believing that the incident prompted Mona to leave him and his father. Mona solves Homer's problem by telling him that the fishing trip never played a role in her leaving.|$|E
60|$|The wind helping them, {{they flew}} forward. The wave rose {{higher and higher}} behind them—it looked almost as steep as a wall—and an {{involuntary}} cry broke from several of <b>the</b> men <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat’s</b> stern rose up it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right, young lady," [...] called out <b>the</b> fisherman, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> {{separated}} still farther; [...] "there never was any fairy known in Otsego; {{but the time}} has been when we could boast of a Natty Bumppo." ...|$|R
