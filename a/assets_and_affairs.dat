They are {{much larger than}} the overseas assets of banks in other developed countries. This paper adopts an institutional, theoretical and empirical approach to explain the large size of these overseas assets. We find that over 80 % of these <b>assets</b> <b>and</b> liabilities are accounted for by foreign-owned UK banks and their large size may be traced {{to the development of the}} Euro-currency markets in London in the late 1950 s and 1960 s. Although net overseas bank assets can, in principle, be explained, the gross assets are more problematic. The theoretical literature is quite limited and the most appropriate macroeconomic framework would be complex and difficult to apply. We therefore examine some simpler empirical hypotheses about the size of these <b>assets</b> <b>and</b> liabilities but find that they are rejected by the data. We conclude that while an institutional and theoretical approach reveals the nature of UK banks' overseas <b>assets</b> <b>and</b> liabilities and suggests some of their determinants, developing a satisfactory empirical model is quite difficult.
