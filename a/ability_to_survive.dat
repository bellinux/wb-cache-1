5|$|The extremophile Deinococcus radiodurans has a {{remarkable}} <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> DNA damage from ionizing radiation and other sources. At least {{two copies of}} the genome, with random DNA breaks, can form DNA fragments through annealing. Partially overlapping fragments are then used for synthesis of homologous regions through a moving D-loop that can continue extension until they find complementary partner strands. In the final step there is crossover by means of RecA-dependent homologous recombination.|$|E
5|$|The hatchling's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> {{winter in}} the nest has allowed the painted turtle to extend its range further north than any other American turtle. The painted turtle is genetically adapted to survive {{extended}} periods of subfreezing temperatures with blood that can remain supercooled and skin that resists penetration from ice crystals in the surrounding ground. The hardest freezes nevertheless kill many hatchlings.|$|E
40|$|Electrophoretic and {{immunological}} {{properties of}} the soluble root protein complement of 6 Medicago sativa L. genotypes in the cold hardened and non-hardened physiological condition were compared. These 6 genotypes were chosen to represent a range of <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> exposure <b>to</b> subfreezing temperatures when in the cold hardened condition...|$|R
50|$|The Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game {{is renowned}} for its lethality. Players who charge into combat unaware will often find their {{characters}} killed in the first session. Proper role-playing is encouraged to avoid combat when unnecessary, but the characters do have requisite <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> if combat is forced in the early stages.|$|R
50|$|Voodoo now {{has limited}} mind-reading capabilities; however she {{is unable to}} control her own mind when she uses these abilities, thus leaving herself {{vulnerable}} to counter telepathy. Also she has the <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> in harsh environment, as seen when she functions in the environment of Europa (the moon of Jupiter), without any form of protection.|$|R
5|$|Today, shetland sheep {{are mainly}} {{kept in the}} Shetland isles {{and a handful of}} other locales. This is because of their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> on {{infertile}} land that would otherwise be agriculturally useless. Their good-natured temperament is also a major attraction in keeping Shetland sheep. They are most commonly farmed for their prized wool, but they also may be kept for their meat.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, {{critics were}} {{impressed}} by the improved sound quality and the group's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> the loss of Gabriel without sacrificing {{the quality of the}} music. The group went out on tour with Collins as frontman and Bill Bruford as an additional drummer, and the resulting performances in the US raised Genesis' profile there. The album has been reissued on CD several times, including a deluxe package with bonus tracks in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Draught camel {{are used}} for several {{purposes}} including ploughing, processing in oil mills and pulling carts. There is no clear description for the ideal draught camel, though its strength, its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> without water and the flatness of its feet could be indicators. It {{may be used for}} ploughing in pairs or in groups with buffaloes or bullocks. The draught camel can plough at around , and should not be used for more than six hours a day four hours in the morning and two in the afternoon. The camel is not easily exhausted unless diseased or undernourished, and has remarkable endurance and hardiness.|$|E
50|$|The Thermoanaero{{bacteria}}les are a polyphyletic {{order of}} bacteria placed within the polyphyletic class Clostridia, and encompassing three families: the Thermoanaerobacteraceae, the Thermodesulfobiaceae, and the Thermoanaerobacterales family III incertae sedis, and various unplaced genera. This order is noted for the species' <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> in environments of extremely elevated temperature. An example organism in this order is Thermoanaerobacterium autearoensis.|$|R

50|$|The aristocrats' <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> are {{far worse}} than those of Crichton, and a role {{reversal}} ensues, with the butler becoming a king among the stranded group. Crichton and Mary are about to wed on the island when the group is rescued. Upon returning to Britain, Crichton chooses not to marry Mary; instead, he asks a maid, Tweeny (who was attracted to Crichton throughout the film), to marry him, and the two move to the United States.|$|R
5|$|The Kerry Bog Pony is a {{mountain}} and moorland breed of pony that originated in Ireland. Possibly {{descended from the}} Irish Hobby horse, it originally lived a mainly feral existence in the peat bogs {{of what is now}} County Kerry in southwestern Ireland. Local inhabitants used the ponies as pack and cart horses for transporting peat and kelp to the villages. The breed developed physical characteristics including a low weight-to-height ratio and an unusual footfall pattern, which helped it move on soft ground such as peat bogs. The ponies were known for hardiness and an <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> in harsh conditions.|$|E
5|$|The central {{concept of}} natural {{selection}} is the evolutionary fitness of an organism. Fitness is measured by an organism's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> and reproduce, which determines {{the size of its}} genetic contribution to the next generation. However, fitness {{is not the same as}} the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes. For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of genetic drift can be illustrated with a simplified example. Consider {{a very large}} colony of bacteria isolated in a drop of solution. The bacteria are genetically identical except for a single gene with two alleles labeled A and B. A and B are neutral alleles meaning {{that they do not}} affect the bacteria's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> and reproduce; all bacteria in this colony are equally likely to survive and reproduce. Suppose that half the bacteria have allele A and the other half have allele B. Thus A and B each have allele frequency 1/2.|$|E

5000|$|In {{times of}} crisis such as {{depletion}} of resources, animals will gain from having foraging innovation <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b> Since there is between foraging behavior and fitness, these behaviors that benefit the organism and help them <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> and reproduce will be selected for and passed on. For some organisms, {{this might be the}} <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> use tools. Without tools the individual {{might not be able to}} find the most profitable prey (e.g. New Caledonian crows). [...] For others it might be the size of the pollen load an individual collects (honeybees). [...] For others it might be creating a way to cooperatively hunt schools of fish in the dark ocean (spinner dolphins).|$|R
5|$|At the FBI, Krycek confesses that Billy Miles {{is one of}} a {{new type}} of aliens that are trying to wipe out humanity's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> the invasionâ€”including Scully's baby, which Krycek states is a special child that the aliens fear. Mulder tells Doggett to send for help. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) arrives as Miles shows up at the J. Edgar Hoover Building. Scully is able to sneak out of the {{building}} with the help of Krycek, Doggett and Reyes. Mulder and Skinner, meanwhile, lead Miles to the roof, where Mulder pushes him off into a waiting garbage truck, which then compacts him. Scully and Reyes pull away. The episode ends with Agent Crane pointing them to safety, then turning around, revealing to the camera that he is a Super Soldier.|$|E
5|$|New {{polls in}} January {{indicated}} voter support was growing for Toomey, who now held a projected nine percentage point lead over Specter and an eight-point lead over Sestak. Specter continued to lead against Sestak in the Democratic primary poll, {{this time by}} a 21-point margin. Some political scientists believed Toomey's gain over Specter {{could be attributed to}} voter distrust of establishment candidates and growing dissatisfaction with the health care proposal pending in Congress. However, some Democratic leaders felt Sestak's challenge to Specter was having a detrimental effect not only to Specter, but to the Democratic party in general and their prospects for ultimately winning the general election. This feeling was enhanced by the growing national support for the Republican party, and especially by the unexpected victory of the Tea Party-backed Republican Scott Brown in a special election for a traditionally Democratic Massachusetts Senate seat. Specter acknowledged to The New York Times that the national political mood might work against him in the primary, but insisted he was not discouraged and expressed confidence in his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{bog turtle}} is {{primarily}} diurnal, active {{during the day}} and sleeping at night. It wakes in the early morning, basks until fully warm, then begins its search for food. It is a seclusive species, making it challenging to observe in its natural habitat. During colder days, the bog turtle will spend much of its time in dense underbrush, underwater, or buried in mud. Such behavior is indicative of the bog turtle's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> without oxygen. On warmer days, the bog turtle's activities include scavenging, mating (during early spring), and basking in sunlight, the last of which it spends {{a great deal of the}} day doing. However, the bog turtle usually takes shelter from the sun during the hottest part of the day. Occasionally, during times of extreme heat, the turtle will either estivate, or become subterranean, sometimes occupying networks of tunnels filled with water. At night, the bog turtle buries itself in soft tunnels.|$|E
50|$|Maria has {{recently}} divorced Batista after realizing they want different things. She is promoted to Captain {{in the first}} episode after blackmailing Matthews over a Madam's contact list which includes his name. Matthews assigns Debra Morgan as the new Lieutenant; this angers LaGuerta, who had promised the position to Batista. Debra is unsure of herself at first and goes to LaGuerta for advice. LaGuerta gives Debra unsound advice in order to undermine her, but Debra soon grows confident enough in her own <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> on her own.|$|R
50|$|Work {{concerning}} female behaviour in {{many species}} of animals has sought to confirm Darwin's basic idea of female preference for males with certain characteristics as {{a major force in}} the evolution of species. Females have often been shown to distinguish small differences among potential mates, and to prefer mating with individuals bearing the most exaggerated characters. In some cases, those males {{have been shown to be}} more healthy and vigorous, suggesting that the ornaments serve as markers indicating the males' <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> and, thus, their genetic qualities.|$|R
50|$|Kamui is a ninja {{from the}} Edo period who {{has decided to}} leave his clan. After doing so he is pursued relentlessly {{by the members of}} his former clan; who {{consider}} him to be a traitor and therefore wish to kill him. Kamui then wanders around Japan to escape from them by using his intelligence and great <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b> In the course of the series Kamui begins to suffer from paranoia because of his status as a persecuted man. Kamui then started to believe that everybody wished to murder him and became distrusting of everyone he came across.|$|R
5|$|Malcolm {{demonstrated}} a rare <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> among early Scottish kings by reigning for twenty-nine years. He was a clever and ambitious man. Brehon tradition {{provided that the}} successor to Malcolm was to be selected by him from among the descendants of King Aedh, {{with the consent of}} Malcolm's ministers and of the church. Ostensibly in an attempt to end the devastating feuds in the north of Scotland, but obviously influenced by the Norman feudal model, Malcolm ignored tradition and determined to retain the succession within his own line. But since Malcolm had no son of his own, he undertook to negotiate a series of dynastic marriages of his three daughters to men who might otherwise be his rivals, while securing the loyalty of the principal chiefs, their relatives. First he married his daughter Bethoc to Crinan, Thane of The Isles, head of the house of Atholl and secular Abbot of Dunkeld; then his youngest daughter, Olith, to Sigurd, Earl of Orkney. His middle daughter, Donada, was married to Finlay, Earl of Moray, Thane of Ross and Cromarty and a descendant of Loarn of Dalriada. This was risky business under the rules of succession of the Gael, but he thereby secured his rear and, taking advantage of the renewal of Viking attacks on England, marched south to fight the English. He defeated the Angles at Carham in 1018 and installed his grandson, Duncan, son of the Abbot of Dunkeld and his choice as Tanist, in Carlisle as King of Cumbria that same year.|$|E
5|$|While on Second Miltia, MOMO, Ziggy, {{chaos and}} Jr. are {{attacked}} by U-TIC agents in powerful mechs, only being saved by Canaan's intervention. Shion meanwhile has an uncomfortable reunion with Jin, as she blames his absence {{for the deaths}} of their parents during the Miltian Conflict. In the hours leading up to MOMO's scan, both Jr. and his brother Gaignun are telepathically tormented by Albedo, who still cannot decode the data he stole from MOMO. During the procedure, a virus implanted in MOMO by Albedo activates, and MOMO fragments her own personality to keep Mizrahi's data secure. Shion, Jr. {{and the rest of the}} group enter MOMO's subconscious to save her. During this period, Jr. reveals himself to have been part of an experiment by Dmitri Yuriev: Yuriev's wish was to create an existence which would neutralize U-DO. The three were close, but Albedo became disturbed when he discovered his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> any injury was unique to him, meaning he could outlive his brothers. During an experiment, Jr. broke the circuit containing a portion of U-DO, resulting in everyone except himself, Albedo and Gaignun being killed. Albedo was touched by U-DO and went insane, while Gaignun remained unaffected. As they save MOMO, Albedo hacks in and tricks MOMO into releasing the decoded data to him. Using the data, Albedo opens the way to Miltia.|$|E

40|$|Acinetobacter spp. have justifiably {{received}} significant {{attention from}} the public, scientific, and medical communities. Over recent years, Acinetobacter, particularly Acinetobacter baumannii, has become a "red-alert" human pathogen, primarily because of its exceptional <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> develop resistance to all currently available antibiotics. This characteristic is compounded by its unique <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> in a diverse range of environments, including those within healthcare institutions, leading to problematic outbreaks. Historically, the virulence of the organism has been questioned, but recent clinical reports suggest that Acinetobacter can cause serious, life-threatening infections. Furthermore, its metabolic adaptability gives it a selective advantage in harsh hospital environments. This review focuses on current understanding of A. baumannii pathogenesis and the model systems used to study this interesting organism...|$|R

25|$|When the T. sessile, a {{subordinate}} species, {{was in the}} presence of dominant ant species such as C. ferrugineus, P. imparis, Lasius alienus, and F. subsericea, they reduced {{the amount of time that}} was spent foraging. This was tested with the use of bait, and when the subordinate species, such as T. sessile, encountered a dominant species they would leave the bait. It would then make sense that the subordinate species would forage at a different time than dominant species, so that they could avoid confrontation, but there is sizable overlap in foraging period on a daily and seasonal basis. Because the T. sissile forages at the same time as dominant species, but does not want to interfere, they must have excellent exploitative <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b>|$|R
