50|$|In each e-caliper a {{controller}} {{uses the}} brake command (received from ECU) {{as a reference}} input. The controller provides drive control commands for <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>control</b> <b>module.</b> This module controls three phase drive currents for the brake actuator which is a permanent magnet DC motor, energised by 42 V sources. In addition to tracking its reference brake command, the caliper controller also controls the position and speed of the brake actuator. Thus, two sensors are vitally required to measure the position and speed of the actuator in each e-caliper. Because of the safety critical nature of the application, even missing {{a limited number of}} samples of these sensory data should be compensated for.|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} a wireless laser displacement sensor node that measures displacement {{as a representative}} damage index for structural health monitoring (SHM). The proposed measurement system consists of a laser displacement sensor (LDS) and a customized wireless sensor node. Wireless communication is enabled by a sensor node that consists of a sensor module, a {{code division multiple access}} (CDMA) communication module, a processor, and a power module. An LDS with a long measurement distance is chosen to increase field applicability. For a wireless sensor node driven by a battery, we use <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>control</b> <b>module</b> with a low-power processor, which facilitates switching between the sleep and active modes, thus maximizing the power consumption efficiency during non-measurement and non-transfer periods. The CDMA mode is also used to overcome the limitation of communication distance, which is a challenge for wireless sensor networks and wireless communication. To evaluate the reliability and field applicability of the proposed wireless displacement measurement system, the system is tested onsite to obtain the required vertical displacement measurements during the construction of mega-trusses and an edge truss, which are the primary structural members in a large-scale irregular building currently under construction. The measurement values confirm the validity of the proposed wireless displacement measurement system and its potential for use in safety evaluations of structural elements...|$|E

40|$|An {{on-board}} diagnostic II (OBD-II) is {{a standard}} diagnostic software management that is installed in <b>a</b> <b>power</b> train <b>control</b> <b>module</b> (PCM). It provides some useful data to the driver. There are four different devices using the OBD-II protocol exists in the market. These devices are used as a driver information system. They are personal digital assistant (PDA) Dyno/OBD-II scan tool, CarChip Fleet, DriveRight 600, and ScanGauge. Each of these four devices has some limitation in term of supporting all features for live data monitoring, trip information, diagnostic trouble code (DTC) scanning system, and data logging system.

40|$|The recent {{modernization}} of the livestock industry lags behind {{the scale of}} the livestock industry, particularly in indoor environmental monitoring. In particular, the H 2 S gas concentration in chicken coops affects the growth and reproductive capacity of the chickens and threatens their health. Therefore, the research and development of a low-cost, environmentally friendly sensor that can achieve on-line monitoring of H 2 S gas has a notably important practical significance. This paper reports the design of an H 2 S gas sensor, with selection of an electrochemical probe with high accuracy and wide measurement range using the relatively mature technology of electrochemical sensors. Although the probe of the sensor is the main factor that affects the sensor accuracy, the probe must be combined with a specifically designed signal condition circuit that can overcome the lack of an electrode to satisfy the requirements for the interconnection and matching between the output signal and the test instrument. Because the output current of the electrochemical electrode is small and likely to be disturbed by noise, we designed signal-conditioning modules. Through the signal-conditioning circuit, the output signal of the current electrode can be converted into a voltage and amplified. In addition, we designed <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>control</b> <b>module</b> because a bias voltage is necessary for the electrode. Finally, after the calibration experiment, the accurate concentration of H 2 S gas can be measured. Based on the experimental analysis, the sensor shows good linearity and selectivity, comparatively high sensitivity, perfect stability and an extremely long operating life of up to two years...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Every {{year about}} 400 people die in submersed {{vehicles}} in North America and this number increases to 2, 000 – 5, 000 in all industrialized nations. The {{best way to}} survive is to quickly exit through the windows. An Automatic Window Opening System (AWOS; patent protected) was designed to sense when a vehicle is in water and to open the electric windows, but only when the vehicle is upright. Methods: The AWOS consists of a Detection Module (DM), in the engine compartment, and <b>a</b> <b>Power</b> Window <b>Control</b> <b>Module</b> (PWCM) inside the driver’s door. The DM contains a Water Sensor, a Level Sensor and a Microcontroller Unit (MCU). The Level Sensor provides the angular orientation of the car using a 3 -axis acceleration sensor and prevents automatic window opening if the car is outside the orientation range (± 20 ° in the roll axis, ± 30 ° in the pitch axis, with a 2 s delay). Systems were installed on two cars and one SUV. A crane lowered vehicles in water either straight down (static tests) or by swinging the vehicles to produce forward movement (dynamic tests). Results: In all tests, when the vehicles landed upright, windows opened immediately and effectively. When vehicles landed inverted, or at a very steep angle, the system did not engage until an upright and level position was attained. Conclusions: This system may help decrease drowning deaths in sinking vehicles. If occupants do not know, or forget, what to do, the open window could hopefully prompt them to exit safely through that window...|$|R
40|$|Power transfer, size, {{and form}} factor are three {{critical}} design factors for next- generation implantable biomedical microdevices. Traditional powering {{methods such as}} batteries and inductive power transfer cannot satisfy conflicting requirements of large penetration depth, omni-directionality, and small size for many emerging applications. For example batteries are still large and have limited lifetime; whereas, inductive powering does not scale well into the mm and sub-mm scale, has limited range, and suffers from severe alignment sensitivity (slight misalignment between the transmitter and receiver coils results in asignificant drop in the received power). The goal of this research has been to develop and characterize several implantable biomedical microdevices that utilize acoustic/ultrasonic wave as <b>a</b> <b>power</b> source or <b>a</b> <b>control</b> signal. Acoustic/ultrasonic wave offers deeper penetration depths, omni-directionality, better scaling at mm and sub-mm dimensions, and easier fabrication process.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{investigates the}} joint design and {{optimization}} of the <b>power</b> <b>control</b> and beamforming codebooks for the single-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless systems with a rate-limited feedback link. The problem is {{cast in the}} form of minimizing the outage probability subject to the transmit power constraint and cardinality constraints on the beamforming and power codebooks. We show that by appropriately choosing and fixing the beamforming codebook and optimizing the power codebook for that beamforming codebook, it is possible to achieve a performance very close to the optimal joint optimization. Further, this paper investigates the optimal tradeoffs between beamforming and power codebook sizes for different number of feedback bits and transmit antennas. Given a target outage probability, our results provide the optimal codebook sizes independent of the target rate. As the outage probability decreases, we show that the optimal joint design should use fewer feedback bits for beamforming and more feedback bits for <b>power</b> <b>control.</b> The jointly optimized beamforming and <b>power</b> <b>control</b> <b>modules</b> combine the <b>power</b> gain of beamforming and diversity gain of <b>power</b> <b>control,</b> which enable it to approach the performance of the system with perfect channel state information as the feedback link capacity increases to infinity — something that is not possible with beamforming or <b>power</b> <b>control</b> alone.
