5000|$|Two {{cars were}} contracted, {{one for the}} {{television}} program and the other as a promotional car, for touring car shows around the United States. Both cars would be built {{in the span of}} four weeks. The first version originally featured a 6-71 supercharged engine, a solid mounted rear <b>axle</b> (<b>no</b> springs) and extra rear end weight. This was to enable the car to [...] "pop wheelies." [...] Because the car had too much power and was difficult to drive, the original blower set up was removed and a dummy blower was fitted. The second car was used as a touring car for auto shows and promotional events. Before its transformation into the Monkeemobile, the second car was first seen on TV as Major Nelson's GTO in [...] "I Dream of Jeannie". Both were used on The Monkees TV series, one during the first season and both throughout the second season.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} was a pusher biplane with a square section nacelle mounted between {{the upper and}} lower wings, which were of two-spar construction, the spars being ash I-sections. To maintain the leading edge section there were half-ribs between each rib, these extending from the leading edge to the main spar. A single horizontal tailplane with a split elevator and a rudder divided into two part, half above and half below the tailplane, were carried on ash booms behind the wing, the booms being connected by hollow wooden vertical struts and tubular steel horizontal members. The booms were spindled to an I-section except at the points of attachment of the cross-members. [...] The upper wing was double the span of the lower and had wide-span ailerons occupying the whole trailing edge outboard of the tail booms. The wings were connected by a single pair of struts on either side, the outer section of the upper wing being braced by wires leading to inverted-V kingposts. The wide-track undercarriage consisted of a pair of long laminated wood skids each bearing pair of wheels on a short <b>axle.</b> <b>No</b> tailskid was fitted.|$|E

40|$|The {{steering}} {{arrangement of}} a 6 x 6 off-road military vehicle was investigated, {{with the aim}} {{to determine if a}} variable steering ratio {{between the first and second}} steering axle of the vehicle will make an improvement in the steady and transient state handling of the vehicle. Low speed manoeuvring was evaluated, comparing the vehicle steering geometry with Ackerman geometry. For steady state handling, a bicycle model was developed, and constant radius simulations at various track radii, vehicle speeds and steering ratios (ratio between the first and second steering axle) was performed. For transient dynamic simulations, a mathematical model was developed that included a simple driver model to steer the vehicle through a single lane change, again at various speeds and steering ratios. The vehicle was instrumented, and actual constant radii tests, as well as single lane change tests were performed. The measurements enabled the comparison of simulated and measured results. Although basic mathematical models were used, acceptable correlation was obtained for both steady state and transient dynamic behaviour. The results indicated that for this specific vehicle geometry, where the centre of mass is above the second <b>axle,</b> <b>no</b> marked improvement would be obtained by implementing a variable ratio steering system. The mathematical model was changed to simulate a vehicle with longer wheelbase and different centre of mass. With the new geometry, theoretical slip angles (and therefore tire wear) reductions were more noticeable It was concluded that a variable ratio system between the front and second axle would not be an economically viable improvement for this vehicle, since the improvement achieved will not warrant the additional cost and complexity added to the vehicle.
