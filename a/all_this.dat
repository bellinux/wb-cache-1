5|$|All {{specimens}} discovered until 1967 were in coarse-grained sandstone {{that prevented}} preservation of fine details, making interpretation difficult. S.B. Misra's discovery of fossiliferous ash-beds at the Mistaken Point assemblage in Newfoundland changed <b>all</b> <b>this</b> as the delicate detail preserved by the fine ash allowed {{the description of}} features that were previously undiscernible.|$|E
5|$|<b>All</b> <b>this</b> {{changed with}} the Libyan coup d'état of 1 September 1969 that deposed Idris and brought Muammar Gaddafi to power. Gaddafi claimed the Aouzou Strip in {{northern}} Chad, referring to an unratified treaty signed in 1935 by Italy and France (then the colonial powers of Libya and Chad, respectively). Such claims had been previously made when in 1954 Idris had tried to occupy Aouzou, but his troops were repelled by the French Colonial Forces.|$|E

5|$|<b>All</b> <b>this</b> time, Bradbury {{remained}} nominally {{a professor}} in absentia at Stanford. The Los Alamos Laboratory was nominally run under a wartime contract with the University of California, but a clause in the contract allowed the University to terminate the contract {{three months after the}} end of the war. The university duly served notice, but Bradbury managed to get it rescinded, and in 1948 the contract was renewed. In 1951, he became a professor at the University of California.|$|E
5|$|Cott's {{account of}} <b>all</b> <b>this</b> (illustrated {{by his own}} pen and ink drawings) is the 550-page book Adaptive Coloration in Animals (1940).

5|$|Critics {{have complained}} that, by museum {{display of the}} remains, the body of Lindow Man has been {{objectified}} rather than treated with the respect due the dead.

5|$|On 15 October, Stalin {{ordered the}} {{evacuation}} of the Communist Party, the General Staff and various civil government offices from Moscow to Kuibyshev (now Samara), leaving {{only a limited number}} of officials behind. The evacuation caused panic among Muscovites. On 16–17 October, much of the civilian population tried to flee, mobbing the available trains and jamming the roads from the city. Despite <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> Stalin publicly remained in the Soviet capital, somewhat calming the fear and pandemonium.|$|E

5|$|The {{reign of}} the Chalukyas saw the arrival of Kannada as the {{predominant}} language of inscriptions along with Sanskrit, {{in areas of the}} Indian peninsula outside what is known as Tamilaham (Tamil country).

5|$|The various {{formations}} of Siletzia {{are characterized}} as marine tholeiitic pillow basalts and volcanic breccia, often interbedded with sedimentary layers of continental origin, lying on oceanic crust.
