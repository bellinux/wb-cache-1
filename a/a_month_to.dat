Bradman's share of the stand was 244 from 271balls, and the Australian total of 701 set up victory by 562runs. For {{the fourth time in}} five series, the Ashes changed hands. England would not recover them again until after Bradman's retirement.|$|E
5|$|Inaction chafed Ball, and {{he began}} {{agitating}} {{for a return to}} combat duty. He finally managed to obtain a posting as a flight commander with No.56 Squadron RFC, considered to be as close to an elite unit as any established by the RFC. Ball was still first among Britain's aces, and some documents hint that his attachment to No.56 Squadron was planned to be temporary.

5|$|Columbia University {{is home to}} many fraternities, sororities, and co-educational Greek organizations. Approximately 10–15% of {{undergraduate}} students are associated with Greek life. There has been a Greek presence on campus since the establishment in 1836 of the Delta Chapter of Alpha Delta Phi. The InterGreek Council is the self-governing student organization that provides guidelines and support to its member organizations {{within each of the}} three councils at Columbia, the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council, and Multicultural Greek Council.

5|$|Further {{activities}} of Operation Labrador were abandoned in September, after Croatian authorities captured the Yugoslav Air Force regional headquarters in Zagreb, and confiscated {{documents related to}} the operation. The authorities took nearly <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>to</b> analyze the captured documents, allowing time for the principal agents involved in the bombings to flee. Fifteen others were arrested {{in connection with the}} attack, but they were subsequently released in a prisoner exchange. Five KOS agents involved in Operation Labrador were tried in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on terrorism charges and acquitted. Croatian authorities captured two KOS agents who were part of the operation and tried them along with seven other agents who were tried in absentia. Those in custody were acquitted, while those tried in absentia were convicted.|$|E
5|$|Humans must consume {{vitamins}} periodically {{but with}} differing schedules, to avoid deficiency. The body's stores for different vitamins vary widely; vitamins A, D, and B12 {{are stored in}} significant amounts, mainly in the liver, and an adult's diet may be deficient in vitamins A and D for many months and B12 in some cases for years, before developing a deficiency condition. However, vitamin B3 (niacin and niacinamide) is not stored in significant amounts, so stores may last {{only a couple of}} weeks. For vitamin C, the first symptoms of scurvy in experimental studies of complete vitamin C deprivation in humans have varied widely, from <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>to</b> more than six months, depending on previous dietary history that determined body stores.|$|E

In the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the Giant Dipper was almost completely untouched. The ride was closed for about <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>to</b> be inspected. The park held a benefit for victims of the earthquake. In 2002, the ride celebrated its 50 millionth rider. Ten years after the 50 millionth rider, the park celebrated the Giant Dipper's 60 millionth rider on July 27, 2012. The park gave out trivia coasters {{leading up to the}} event. The 24 riders that were on the train when it hit 60 million riders received a hoodie among other prizes.|$|E
5|$|In 1978 Robert Randall {{sued the}} federal {{government}} for arresting him for using cannabis to treat his glaucoma. The judge ruled Randall needed cannabis for medical purposes and required the Food and Drug Administration set up a program to grow cannabis on a farm at the University of Mississippi and to distribute 300 cannabis cigarettes <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>to</b> Randall. In 1992 George H. W. Bush discontinued the program after Randall tried to make HIV/AIDS patients eligible for the program. Thirteen people were already enrolled and were allowed to continue receiving cannabis cigarettes; today the government still ships cannabis cigarettes to four people. Irvin Rosenfeld, who became eligible to receive cannabis from the program in 1982 to treat rare bone tumors, urged the George W. Bush administration to reopen the program; however, he was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the bombings in Zagreb, Josip Manolić, who had just been appointed head of the Croatian intelligence service, claimed Croatian right-wing extremists were responsible. Operation Labrador was abandoned after the ZNG and the Croatian police captured the Yugoslav Air Force headquarters in Zagreb on 15 September 1991, during the Battle of the Barracks. The materials captured inside the facility included codes and computer disks related to Operation Labrador, as well as Sabolović's notes. Sabolović turned the materials over to his immediate superior at headquarters, Mirko Martić, but Martić failed to destroy them. In response, Sabolović fled Zagreb. Croatian police took almost <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>to</b> analyze the captured materials properly and uncover Operation Labrador. Sabolović later claimed that only a part of the Operation Labrador network was dismantled, but he was contradicted by KOS Major Mustafa Čandić who was posted at the Zemun headquarters of KOS.|$|E

ABC created a study guide for the show, mailing out some 39,000 copies <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>to</b> educators and fans.|$|E
5|$|Rossia {{was built}} by the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg. Construction began in October 1893 {{although}} she was not formally laid down until 20 May 1895 and launched on 30 April 1896.

Rossia entered service in late 1896 and participated in Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Fleet Review in June 1897 at Spithead.
