40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} a complex problem {{because there are a}} number of {{different}} histological cell types. Those commonly grouped as bronchogenic carcinoma (epidermoid carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large cell undifferentiated carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and adenosquamos carcinoma) account for more than 90 % ofthe new cases and the deaths each year.

40|$|Hypercoagulability with {{resultant}} thrombosis as {{a leading}} cause of death remains unproven {{due to the lack of}} a global screening coagulation test documenting antecedent hypercoagulability. To fill this need a modified recalcification time (MRT) test that incorporates the contribution of all the circulating cellular and chemical mediators, including the important but neglected tissue factor, to coagulation is described. Aliquots of blood are incubated with saline and with endotoxin, and the MRT is instrumentally determined. Values outside the normal ranges of 5. 3 to 8. 5 minutes (saline) and 4. 5 to 7. 5 minutes (endotoxin) in the coagulation spectrum of 0 to 10 minutes to infinity are abnormal. Shorter values are inversely related to the degree of hypercoagulability. To assess MRT in detecting hypercoagulability, MRT values in conditions with known thrombotic risk that were reported individually are presented by indicating the percentages of each in the abnormal ranges. The conditions, all with statistically significant hypercoagulability, included early breast cancer, diabetes, head, neck, and colon cancer, peripheral vascular disease, and pregnancy. Modified recalcification time meets the criteria of a global coagulation screening test because of: 1) age-related prevalence of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>cancer</b> and thrombotic cardiovascular disease, 2) specificity and sensitivity, and 3) expected lower morbidity and mortality with early intervention...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Routine {{follow-up}} {{offered to}} patients with laryngeal carcinoma in The Netherlands consisted of 22 routine visits over a time period of 10 years after treatment. The primary aims of the follow-up were to detect cancer recurrence in asymptomatic patients and to achieve better survival outcome by reducing cancer-specific mortality rates. METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study was performed to evaluate {{the effect of this}} follow-up schedule. Between January 1990 and January 1995, the authors studied all patients with primary laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma who were treated with intention to cure. For patients who developed cancer recurrence, all routine and extra visits were documented. Reported symptoms and physical evidence of tumor were mapped. RESULTS: The patients complied with the follow-up protocol closely. In only 2 % of all routine visits an <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>cancer</b> recurrence was found. There was no difference in survival and tumor mortality rates for patients with and without symptoms, despite the difference in whether the therapy applied had the intention to cure. It seemed that patients who developed tumor recurrence after therapy for laryngeal carcinoma received no benefit from screening for cancer recurrence detection. The lack of benefit for cancer detection screening among asymptomatic patients might be explained by unfavorable tumor biology parameters.

These starting points, however, are not based on solid scientific evidence. Our aim {{was to assess the}} time interval between onset of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal carcinoma (CRC), and subsequently evaluate how many patients developed cancer before their surveillance was recommended to commence. METHODS: A nationwide automated pathology database (PALGA) was consulted to identify patients with IBD-associated colorectal carcinoma in seven university medical centres in The Netherlands between January 1990 and June 2006. Data were collected retrospectively from patient charts. Time intervals between onset of disease and cancer diagnosis were calculated in months. RESULTS: 149 patients were identified with confirmed diagnoses of IBD and CRC (ulcerative colitis n = 89 /Crohn's disease n = 59 /indeterminate colitis n = 1). Taking date of diagnosis as the entry point, 22 % of patients developed cancer before the 8 or 15 year starting points of surveillance, and 28 % if surveillance was commenced 10 or 20 years after diagnosis for extensive or left-sided disease, respectively. Using onset of symptoms to calculate the time interval, 17 - 22 % of patients would present with cancer prior to the surveillance starting points.

This program has been recognized as an option for opportunistic screening, particularly in Japan. However, reports on diagnostic accuracy have been limited. We aimed to evaluate the detectability and related properties of this screening program among asymptomatic individuals in a community setting. [Methods]The study participants were 1, 762 residents of Osaka Prefecture, Japan, who underwent opportunistic {{cancer screening}} at Higashitemma Clinic for the first time between November 2004 and December 2005. FDG-PET cancer screening was performed with several imaging modalities (e. g., FDG-PET, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography) and fecal occult blood test. Screening records were linked to the Osaka cancer registry within 1 year after the screening to determine sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values. [Results]After excluding 12 participants with cancer detected before the screening, 33 were identified by the cancer registry to have primary cancers. Of these, the present screening program found that 28 were positive (6 prostate, 5 lung, 5 colorectal, 5 thyroid, 3 liver and 4 others). Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values were 84. 8 % (28 / 33, 95 % confidence interval 69. 1 – 93. 3), 86. 8 % (1, 491 / 1, 718, 85. 1 – 88. 3) and 10. 1 % (28 / 277, 6. 4 – 12. 9), respectively.

The CECT results were classified into normal, true-positive (metastases) or false-positive findings. Abnormal CECT findings, including true- and false-positive results, were detected in 65 patients (13. 5 %). Of these, 26 patients (5. 4 %) showed confirmed true metastatic disease, including 18 lung metastases, 11 liver metastases and 13 bone metastases. Upstaging to stage IV due to the results of the CECT scan occurred in 0 of 155 patients at stage I, 5 of 261 patients (1. 9 %) at stage II and 21 of 67 patients (31. 3 %) at stage III. The false-positive rates were 7. 7, 9. 0 and 8. 7 % in stages I, II and III, respectively. The size of the lung or liver metastasis was significantly larger than the false-positive lesion.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Approximately 10 - 15 % of all {{pancreatic}} cancers (PCs) may be hereditary in origin. We {{investigated the}} use of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) for the screening of individuals {{at high risk for}} developing PC. In this paper the results of first-time screening with EUS are presented. METHODS: Those eligible for screening in this study were first-degree family members of affected individuals from familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) families, mutation carriers of PC-prone hereditary syndromes, individuals with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and mutation carriers of other PC-prone hereditary syndromes with clustering (>= 2 cases per family) of PC. All individuals were asymptomatic and had not undergone EUS before. RESULTS: Forty-four individuals (M/F 18 / 26), aged 32 - 75 years underwent screening with EUS. Thirteen were from families with familial atypical multiple-mole melanoma (FAMMM), 21 with FPC, 3 individuals were diagnosed with hereditary pancreatitis, 2 were Peutz-Jeghers patients, 3 were BRCA 1 and 2 were BRCA 2 mutation carriers with familial clustering of PC, and 1 individual had a p 53 mutation. Three (6. 8 %) patients had an asymptomatic mass lesion (12, 27, and 50 mm) in the body (n = 2) or tail of the pancreas. All lesions were completely resected. Pathology showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas with N 1 disease in the two patients with the largest lesions. EUS showed branch-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN) in seven individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Screening of individuals at a high risk for PC with EUS is feasible and safe.

METHODS: Four hundred sixteen patients with chronic hepatitis of more than 5 years' duration were evaluated (340 HCV, 69 HBV, 7 both). All underwent hepatic ultrasound and measurement of serum alpha-fetoprotein every 3 months. Liver biopsy was performed on entry into the study to determine the severity of hepatitis-related liver injury. RESULTS: Initial screening identified <b>asymptomatic</b> hepatocellular <b>cancer</b> in 33 patients (7. 9 %). Three additional liver cancers were detected during the 1 st year of follow-up, bringing the overall incidence to 8. 6 %. Treatment with curative intent was possible in 22 of these patients (61. 1 %), whereas 14 (38. 9 %) had advanced disease. Thirty-five of these hepatocellular cancers occurred in a subset of 140 patients (25 % incidence) with liver biopsies showing severe chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or both, and one hepatocellular cancer occurred among the 276 patients (0. 4 %) with histologically less severe liver injury (p < 0. 0001, chi square test). CONCLUSIONS: This screening study in patients with chronic HBV or HCV infection demonstrates (1) that the yield of <b>asymptomatic</b> hepatocellular <b>cancer</b> on initial screening is 7. 9 % and (2) that patients with severe chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or both are at extremely high risk to develop hepatocellular cancer (25 %).

The widespread use of the recently introduced multi-detector CT scanners has resulted in {{an increasing number of}} incidentally diagnosed pulmonary embolism (PE) in <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>cancer</b> patients. The significance and clinical outcome of such incidental PE is described. Methods: Both radiology department and hospital databases were searched for all cancer patients with a diagnosis of incidental PE. CT scans were performed using a 64 -slice scanner with a 5. 0 mm slice thickness. Results: During the study period, 34 patients with incidental PE were identified. The mean age (&plusmn;SD) was 57. 7 (&plusmn; 12. 4) years. All patients had active cancer, gastric, lung, colorectal, and lymphomas being the most frequent. Most patients had advanced-stage disease at the time of PE diagnosis; 26 (77 %) patients had stage IV, whereas only 3 patients had stages I or II disease. Twenty-seven (79 %) patients had their PE while undergoing active treatment with chemotherapy (68 %) or radiotherapy (12 %); none, however, were on hormonal therapy. Most (74 %) patients had their PE diagnosed without history of recent hospital admission. Except for 5 (15 %), all other patients were anticoagulated.

40|$|Background: DNA {{methylation}} is {{a well-known}} epigenetic mechanism involved in epigenetic gene regulation. Several genes were reported hypermethylated in CRC, althought no gene marker was proven to be individually of sufficient sensitivity or specificity in routine clinical practice. Here, we identified novel epigenetic markers and assessed their combined use for diagnostic accuracy. Methods: We used methylation arrays on samples from several effluents to characterize methylation profiles in CRC samples and controls, as established by colonoscopy and pathology findings, and selected two differentially methylated candidate epigenetic genes (NPY, PENK). To this gene panel we added WIF, {{on the basis of}} being reported in literature as silenced by promoter hypermethylation in several cancers, including CRC. We measured their methylation degrees by quantitative multiplex-methylation specific PCR (QM-MSP) on 15 paired carcinomas and adjacent non-cancerous colorectal tissues and we subsequently performed a clinical validation on two different series of 266 serums, subdivided in 32 CRC, 26 polyps, 47 other cancers and 161 with normal colonoscopy. We assessed the results by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), using cumulative methylation index (CMI) as variable threshold. Results: We obtained CRC detection on tissues with both sensitivity and specificity of 100 %. On serum CRC samples, we obtained sensitivity/specificity values of, e. g., 87 %/ 80 %, 78 %/ 90 % and 59 %/ 95 %, and negative predictive value/positive predictive value figures of 97 %/ 47 %, 95 %/ 61 % and 92 %/ 70 %. On serum samples from other cancers we obtained sensitivity/specificity of, e. g, 89 %/ 25 %, 43 %/ 80 % and 28 %/ 91 %. Conclusions: We showed the potential of NPY, PENK, and WIF 1 as combined epigenetic markers for CRC diagnosis, both in tissue and serum and tested their use as serum biomarkers in other cancers. We optimized a QM-MSP for simultaneously quantifying their methylation levels. Our assay can be an effective blood test for patients where CRC risk is present but difficult to assess (e. g. mild symptoms with no CRC family history) and who would therefore not necessarily choose to go for further examination. This panel of markers, if validated, can also be a cost effective screening tool for the detection of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>cancer</b> patients for colonoscopy...|$|E
40|$|Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), {{including}} {{ulcerative colitis}} and Crohn’s disease, {{is a group}} of chronic disorders with varying phenotypes and disease severity. The worldwide incidence and prevalence rates are rising. It has been estimated that around 90, 000 Dutch inhabitants had IBD by the end of 2003, which makes IBD, in order of magnitude, comparable to diseases such as breast cancer, sporadic colorectal cancer and dementia. One of the most feared long-term complications of IBD is colorectal cancer. It is considered best medical practice to prevent colorectal cancer in IBD by colonoscopic surveillance to detect <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>cancer</b> or precancerous dysplastic lesions. The aim of this thesis is to provide better evidence for colonoscopic surveillance in IBD in order to improve guidelines. In the period 2008 - 2013, we published or submitted for publication 6 studies that all focused on colonoscopic surveillance in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We showed that a large proportion of patients (10 - 20 %) do not benefit from surveillance because they already had developed colorectal cancer before the recommended starting date of surveillance as they were published in 2002 - 2003. Despite this shortcoming, we found that patients who underwent colonoscopic surveillance had improved colorectal cancer-related survival and overall survival compared to patients in whom no surveillance was performed. In our meta-analysis we found that both Crohn’s colitis and ulcerative colitis are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer with a relative risk of 1. 7. We confirmed that extensive disease is a risk factor. Using the Leuven University IBD-database for validation, we showed {{that it is possible to}} predict colorectal cancer risk in IBD patients by scoring 4 characteristics: IBD-type, primary sclerosing cholangitis, post-inflammatory polyps, and extensive disease. In 2009 and 2010 the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) and the American Gastroenterological Association updated their surveillance guidelines. The BSG guideline recommends a risk stratification approach that we have adopted for clinical practice as well. Employing Markov modeling, we showed that the BSG surveillance strategy with different colonoscopy intervals of 5 years, 3 years and 1 year is more cost-effective as compared to conventional annual surveillance for IBD with primary sclerosing cholangitis and bi-annual surveillance for all other IBD patients as proposed by the AGA. In order to further improve surveillance guidelines, we propose that future studies need to focus on the following items: 1) Validation of the risk profiling approach in prospectively followed cohorts of IBD patients; 2) Validation of the proposed surveillance intervals of 1, 3 and 5 years for the corresponding low, intermediate and high risk groups; 3) Addition of molecular biomarkers for neoplastic progression to the current risk profiling. This will undoubtedly aid in further tailoring surveillance guidelines to the individual patient and in achieving the most cost-efficient way of preventing colorectal cancer in IBD...|$|E
40|$|In the United Kingdom {{there are}} almost 31, 000 new cases of {{colorectal}} cancer each year and nearly 20, 000 deaths. It {{is the second most}} common cause of all deaths from cancer in the United Kingdom. The efficacy of screening with faecal occult blood tests to detect and treat tumours at an early stage, and thereby to reduce mortality, is currently being assessed in several randomised controlled trials. In general, faecal occult blood tests have a low sensitivity and only moderate levels of uptake among the population invited for screening. Until the studies in Denmark, Sweden, and Nottingham report their findings, there is no case for providing such screening routinely to an asymptomatic population. Detecting and removing premalignant adenomas by flexible sigmoidoscopy could be more effective than detecting early localised, <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>cancers</b> in reducing deaths from colorectal cancer. It is estimated that screening people at about the age of 60 by a single flexible sigmoidoscopy examination with appropriate colonoscopic surveillance could prevent 5500 cases of colorectal cancer and 3500 deaths in the United Kingdom each year. A randomised controlled trial to confirm these observations should be seen as a priority...|$|R
40|$|It is {{currently}} undisputed that cystoscopy is required after each hysterectomy {{to confirm the}} integrity of the urinary tract before leaving the operating room. Sometimes, secondary findings are detected on cystoscopy like interstitial cystitis and exophytic tumors. We are reporting a case of <b>asymptomatic</b> bladder <b>cancer</b> discovered incidentally during a posthysterectomy cystoscopy. The chance of a woman having this cancer is about 1 in 85. This demonstrates the additional merit of performing cystoscopy after hysterectomy as a screening test for bladder cancer...|$|R
