5|$|The {{canonical}} five murders were perpetrated at night, on {{or close}} to a weekend, either {{at the end of}} a month or a week (or so) after. The mutilations became increasingly severe as the series of murders proceeded, except for that of Stride, whose attacker may have been interrupted. Nichols was not missing any organs; Chapman's uterus was taken; Eddowes had her uterus and a kidney removed <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> mutilated; and Kelly's body was eviscerated <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> hacked away, though only her heart was missing from the crime scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} Machiko Kyō's second {{collaboration}} with Mizoguchi, {{as she had}} a small role in his 1944 film The Three Danjuros. She had collaborated much more frequently with Masayuki Mori. As Lady Wakasa, Kyō's costume was modeled after fashion before the Edo period <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was designed to appear similar to a mask common in Noh theatre.|$|E
25|$|On July 5, 1997, two {{fishermen}} found Rachel's body in Oxford Lake {{chained to}} cinder blocks <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> wrapped copiously with duct tape. According to the coroner, {{she was alive}} when she entered the lake and died from drowning.|$|E

25|$|Often {{as part of}} cheerleading at William and Mary, {{including}} {{for games}} and parades, a man and/or woman wore Native American inspired costume. This was common from the 1950s through the early 1990s. The 1992 Colonial Echo yearbook includes mention of student Shawn Wilkins who dressed as the mascot. She wore a white dress with fringe, a headband with feathers, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was painted (p.309).|$|E
25|$|Li Tobler (1948 – 19 May 1975) was a Swiss stage actress. She {{is perhaps}} best for {{her work as a}} model for the artist H. R. Giger, with whom she also had a romantic relationship. Two of Giger's major {{paintings}} were portraits of Li, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> can also be recognised in some of his semi-abstract subjects where man and machine are fused into one.|$|E
25|$|Marie Louise was not {{considered}} attractive, as her features were heavy <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was dominated by a large nose. She was however very charming, and greeted those of all ranks with natural friendliness and sincere concern for their well being. They had two children before his untimely death by drowning on 14 July 1711, the youngest of whom was born after his death. William Charles Henry Friso's birth was met with great relief by the Frisians, and he automatically inherited the title Prince of Orange.|$|E

25|$|In a late-1990s interview, Page stated {{she would}} not allow any current {{pictures}} of her to be shown {{because of concerns about}} her weight. However, in 1997, Page changed her mind and agreed to a rare television interview for the aforementioned E! True Hollywood Story/Page special on the condition that the location of the interview <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> not be revealed (she was shown with her face and dress electronically blacked out). Page allowed a publicity picture to be taken of her for the August 2003 edition of Playboy. In 2006, the Los Angeles Times ran an article headlined A Golden Age for a Pinup, covering an autographing session at her current publicity company, CMG Worldwide. Once again, Page declined to be photographed, saying she would rather be remembered as she was.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} Myshkin's trip {{is to make}} the {{acquaintance}} of his distant relative Lizaveta Prokofyevna Yepanchina, and to make inquiries about a matter of business. Madame Yepanchina is the wife of General Yepanchin, a wealthy and respected man in his mid-fifties. When the Prince calls on them, he is instructed to wait by a servant. He strikes up a conversation with the servant, treating him as an equal and expatiating, to the lackey's surprise, {{on the subject of the}} horror of capital punishment. General Yepanchin has an ambitious and vain assistant, Gavril Ardalionovich Ivolgin (Ganya), who the Prince also meets while waiting. The General and his business partner, the aristocrat Totsky, are seeking to arrange a marriage between Ganya and Nastassya Filippovna. Though herself of noble descent, Nastassya Filippovna became a ward of Totsky at the age of 7, following a family tragedy. When she was 16, Totsky had settled her in a comfortable little house in the country, provided her with tutors, a library and other cultural refinements, and for the next four years treated her as his concubine. Now a grown woman, she has made it frighteningly clear to him that she does not intend to let him off lightly. Totsky, thinking the marriage might settle her and free him to pursue his desire for marriage with General Yepanchin's eldest daughter, has promised 75,000 rubles. Nastassya Filippovna, unsure of Ganya's motives and aware that his family does not approve of her, has reserved her decision but has promised to announce it that evening at her birthday soirée. Ganya and the General openly discuss the subject in front of Myshkin. Ganya shows him a photograph of her, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> particularly strikes him. The Prince tells them of Rogozhin's interest in Nastassya Filippovna, and Ganya asks the Prince whether Rogozhin would marry her. The Prince replies that he might well marry her and then murder her a week later.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{performed}} the song at the 2013 YouTube Music Awards on November 3, 2013. She {{arrived on the}} red carpet of the event wearing the same pair of rotten, yellow teeth she wore on the cover art. John Walker from MTV News analyzed Gaga's look to be a combination of the snake from Tim Burton's 1988 fantasy film, Beetlejuice, the Scarecrow character from DC Comics and the rocker Marilyn Manson. During the performance, the singer wore a flannel shirt, her natural hair and a snapback with the NASA symbol altered to read DOPE <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was devoid of any make-up. She performed a piano only version of [...] "Dope", without any other instrumentation and with tears falling down her face. Gaga exited the stage while shaking hands and hugging the members of the audience.|$|E

500|$|Virginia was {{described}} as having dark hair and violet eyes, with skin so pale it was called [...] "pure white", causing a [...] "bad complexion that spoiled her looks". One visitor to the Poe family noted that [...] "the rose-tint upon her cheek was too bright", possibly a symptom of her illness. Another visitor in Fordham wrote, [...] "Mrs. Poe looked very young; she had large black eyes, and a pearly whiteness of complexion, which was a perfect pallor. Her pale face, her brilliant eyes, and her raven hair gave her an unearthly look." [...] That unearthly look was mentioned by others who suggested it made her look not quite human. William Gowans, who once lodged with the family, described Virginia as a woman of [...] "matchless beauty and loveliness, her eye could match that of any houri, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> defy the genius of a Canova to imitate". She {{might have been a}} little plump. Many contemporary accounts as well as modern biographers remark on her childlike appearance even {{in the last years of}} her life.|$|E
500|$|On 27 October 1659 three QuakersMarmaduke Stevenson, William Robinson and Mary Dyerwere {{led to the}} Boston gallows {{from the}} prison {{where they had been}} {{recently}} held for their Quaker evangelism, against which Massachusetts had enacted very strict laws. [...] Wilson, now nearly 70, as pastor of the Boston church was on hand as the supervising minister. As the two Quaker men first approached the gallows, wearing hats, Wilson said to Robinson, [...] "Shall such jacks as you come in before authority with your hats on?" [...] Ignoring the barb, Robinson then let forth a barrage of words, to which Wilson angrily responded, [...] "Hold thy tongue, be silent; thou art going to die with a lie in your mouth." [...] The two Quaker men were then hanged, after which it was Dyer's turn to ascend the ladder. [...] As the noose was fastened about her neck, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> covered, a young man came running and shouting, wielding a document which he waved before the authorities. Governor Endecott had stayed her execution. [...] After the two executions had taken place, Wilson was said to have written a ballad about the event, which was sung by young men around Boston.|$|E
500|$|The gallows {{consisted}} of {{nothing more than}} a large elm tree. [...] Here the prisoners would step up a ladder with one end of a rope about their neck and the other end secured to the tree, and the ladder would then be pulled away. [...] William Robinson {{was the first of the}} three to mount the ladder, and when he was positioned he made a statement to the crowd, then died when the ladder was removed. [...] Marmaduke Stephenson was the next to hang, and then it was Dyer's turn, after she witnessed the execution of her two friends. [...] Dyer's arms and legs were bound <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was covered with a handkerchief provided by Reverend John Wilson who had been one of her pastors in the Boston church many years earlier. [...] She stood calmly on the ladder, prepared for her death, but as she waited, an order of a reprieve was announced. [...] A petition from her son, William, had given the authorities an excuse to avoid her execution. [...] It had been a pre-arranged scheme, in an attempt to unnerve and dissuade Dyer from her mission. [...] This was made clear from the wording of the reprieve, though Dyer's only expectation was to die as a martyr.|$|E

500|$|Several {{witnesses}} later {{reported that}} they heard a loud gunshot at approximately 15:30. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, opened the study door with Bormann at his side. Linge later stated that he immediately noted a scent of burnt almonds, which is a common observation {{in the presence of}} prussic acid (the aqueous form of hydrogen cyanide). Hitler's adjutant, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Günsche, entered the study and found the two lifeless bodies on the sofa. Eva, with her legs drawn up, was to Hitler's left and slumped away from him. Günsche stated that Hitler [...] "... sat... sunken over, with blood dripping out of his right temple. He had shot himself with his own pistol, a Walther PPK 7.65". The gun lay at his feet and according to SS-Oberscharführer Rochus Misch, Hitler's head was lying {{on the table in front}} of him. Blood dripping from Hitler's right temple and chin had made a large stain on the right arm of the sofa and was pooling on the carpet. According to Linge, Eva's body had no visible physical wounds, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> showed how she had died—by cyanide poisoning. Günsche and SS-Brigadeführer Wilhelm Mohnke stated [...] "unequivocally" [...] that all outsiders and those performing duties and work in the bunker [...] "did not have any access" [...] to Hitler's private living quarters during the time of death (between 15:00 and 16:00).|$|E
2500|$|Karolína Kurková ( [...] ; born 28 February 1984), also Karolina Kurkova, is a Czech model, {{best known}} as a former Victoria's Secret Angel, and actress. Mario Testino praised the [...] "proportions of her body <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> as well as her energy level", which he said [...] "ma her a model who could fit almost into any moment". Vogue editor Anna Wintour called her the [...] "next supermodel".|$|E
2500|$|The Silvertown Explosion is dramatised in the LWT series Upstairs, Downstairs (Series4, Episode9, [...] "Another Year"). [...] Scullery maid Ruby Finch {{had left}} her employer, the Bellamy family at 165Eaton Place, {{to work in a}} munitions factory for the war-effort. The {{explosion}} is not only heard at the home of her former employer in Belgravia, but it literally rocks the house. The residents can see a great fire in the distance, [...] "down the river somewhere." [...] Ruby makes her way back to the house and relates her account of being in the factory when the explosion occurred. She is in deep shock, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> is covered in a sulphurous yellow residue.|$|E

2500|$|John Farrar was {{the captain}} of the Edgartown Fire Rescue unit and diver who {{recovered}} Kopechne's body. He alleged that Kopechne died from suffocation rather than from drowning or from the impact of the overturned vehicle. This hypothesis was based upon the posture in which he found the body and the body's relative position to the area of an ultimate air pocket in the overturned vehicle. Farrar also asserted that Kopechne would have likely survived if a more timely rescue attempt had been conducted. Farrar located Kopechne's body in the well of the backseat of the overturned submerged car. Rigor mortis was apparent, her hands were clasping the backseat, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was turned upward. Farrar testified at the Inquest: ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{helped the}} girls change into long white nightgowns. She then softly combed their hair. Misch tried to {{concentrate}} on his work but {{he knew what was}} going to happen. Magda then went back up to the Vorbunker with the children. Shortly thereafter, Werner Naumann came down to the Führerbunker and told Misch that he had seen Hitler's personal physician, Dr Stumpfegger give the children something [...] "sweetened" [...] to drink. About two hours later, Magda came back down to the Führerbunker, alone. She looked very pale, her eyes very red <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was [...] "frozen". She sat down at a table and began playing patience. Goebbels then came over to her, but did not say a word at that time.|$|E
2500|$|In Philadelphia Museum of Art's Portrait of Madame Augustine Roulin and Baby Marcelle Augustine holds baby Marcelle who {{was born}} in July, 1888. [...] The mother, relaxed <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> in a shadow, is passive. [...] We can see by the size of Augustine's sloping shoulders, arm, and hands that she worked hard {{to take care of her}} family. For instance, there were no modern conveniences like washing machines. [...] In a {{traditional}} pose of mothers and new babies, Augustine is holding her baby upright, supporting the baby's back by her right arm and steadying the baby's midsection with her left hand. Marcelle, whose face is directed outward, is more active and engages the audience. [...] Van Gogh used heavy outlines in blue around the images of mother and baby.|$|E
