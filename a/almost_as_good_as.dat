5|$|There {{was much}} {{speculation}} {{going into the}} Stakes over Secretariat's bid for the Triple Crown. Since 1948, when Citation achieved the feat, there had been six horses that had won both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes before failing in the Belmont Stakes. When comparing Secretariat to those six horses' health and fitness before the Belmont Stakes, writer Bonifice felt Secretariat {{was in the best}} shape, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> when he entered the Kentucky Derby weeks prior. Just days before the Belmont, Secretariat ran five furlongs in just under a minute in a morning workout. Following that, Secretariat's jockey Ron Turcotte told reporters that Secretariat was ready for a top charge on Saturday.|$|E
25|$|The 1904 {{club was}} <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> the {{previous}} year's team, {{but due to}} the emergence of the New York Highlanders as a strong contender, the Americans found themselves in a tight pennant race through the last games of the season. Foreshadowing what would eventually become a storied rivalry, the 1904 race featured such controversial moves as the trade of Patsy Dougherty to the Highlanders for Bob Unglaub.|$|E
25|$|A {{symmetric}} operator A {{is always}} closable; that is, {{the closure of}} the graph of A is the graph of an operator. A symmetric operator is said to be essentially self-adjoint if the closure of A is self-adjoint. Equivalently, A is essentially self-adjoint if it has a unique self-adjoint extension. In practical terms, having an essentially self-adjoint operator is <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> having a self-adjoint operator, since we merely need to take the closure to obtain self-adjoint operator.|$|E

25|$|This was an {{incredible}} feat, considering that Australia's bowling attack was <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> its batting. Their bowling-lineup boasted of some stellar names: Keith Miller, who was a genuine allrounder capable of giving very good performances with both bat and the ball, Ray Lindwall, who was said to possess absolute mastery of bowling in any condition, an who was bowling accurately, with penetrative and attacking bowling, and Ian Johnson and Bill Johnston, who were both equally vital cogs in the team. This particular innings of Hazare's {{was said to have}} enhanced India's reputation as well as his. In the process, Hazare emulated Bradman, who did the same in the previous test.|$|E
500|$|LeMond did not apologize. The U.S. {{team was}} {{not set up}} as the European teams, {{and did not have}} an {{independent}} race to determine the national champion. Instead the highest finisher at the World's was considered the national champion. LeMond had argued for the team to compete as the European teams did, but team management and Boyer voted against him. Thus unlike the other teams at the world championship, the US riders were competing against each other. Aged 21, LeMond was the first American pro to win a medal at the World's since Frank Kramer took silver in 1912. Said LeMond: [...] "I'm racing for Renault and I'm racing for myself. It's a business and it's my living. To me, that second place was <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> winning, especially at my age." ...|$|E
500|$|Metroid II was {{developed}} by Nintendo Research & Development 1 (Nintendo R), and produced by Gunpei Yokoi; they both also worked on the previous Metroid game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was directed by Hiroji Kiyotake and Hiroyuki Kimura, and designed by Makoto Kano, while Takahiro Harada serving as the main programmer. Metroid II marked a [...] "new high point" [...] for handheld game consoles, with graphics that were <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> the 8-bit graphics in games for the NES. The game features enhancements from its predecessor that include easier controls which allow Samus to crouch while firing at the same time, and jump while shooting straight down to attack anything below her. The game also utilizes the cartridge's battery-backed memory for saving the player's progress. In the 2004 interview for the Nintendo Dream magazine, Kiyotake revealed that the planet SR388 was named after the Yamaha SR400 motorcycle.|$|E

[...] He was also very fond of morphine and oxycodone (Eukodal), beginning with therapeutic use of morphine after being wounded in the groin during the November 1923 Beer Hall Putsch in Munich and then specifically starting dihydrocodeine therapy in the early 1930s for a toothache.|$|E

He started favourite for the Grand National Trial Chase at Punchestown Racecourse in February 1997 but was pulled up three fences from the finish. Despite his lack of recent success, he was again allotted top weight of 164 pounds for the 1997 Grand National. He ran well for much of the way before finishing fifth of the thirty-six runners behind Lord Gyllene. According to Williamson, [...] "Only sheer courage got him home.

2500|$|The {{heavy duty}} [...] narrow-gauge {{railways}} in Australia (e.g. Queensland), South Africa, and New Zealand show {{that if the}} track is built to a heavy-duty standard, performance <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> a standard gauge line is possible.

[...] gauge, it has over-100-pound rail (...) and a loading gauge almost as large as US nonexcess-height lines. It has multiple [...] locomotives and 200+ car trains. In South Africa and New Zealand, the loading gauge {{is similar to the}} restricted British loading gauge, and in New Zealand some British Rail Mark 2 carriages have been rebuilt with new bogies for use by Tranz Scenic (Wellington-Palmerston North service), Tranz Metro (Wellington-Masterton service), and Transdev Auckland (Auckland suburban services).|$|E
2500|$|... "Sequential" [...] spectrometers have {{a single}} variable-geometry {{monochromator}} (but usually with an arrangement for selecting from a choice of crystals), a single detector assembly (but usually {{with more than one}} detector arranged in tandem), and a single electronic pack. The instrument is programmed to move through a sequence of wavelengths, in each case selecting the appropriate X-ray tube power, the appropriate crystal, and the appropriate detector arrangement. The length of the measurement program is essentially unlimited, so this arrangement is very flexible. Because there is only one monochromator, the tube-sample-crystal distances can be kept very short, resulting in minimal loss of detected intensity. The obvious disadvantage is relatively long analysis time, particularly when many elements are being analysed, not only because the elements are measured in sequence, but also because {{a certain amount of time}} is taken in readjusting the monochromator geometry between measurements. Furthermore, the frenzied activity of the monochromator during an analysis program is a challenge for mechanical reliability. However, modern sequential instruments can achieve reliability <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> that of simultaneous instruments, even in continuous-usage applications.|$|E
2500|$|In came Gilchrist, and {{he began}} playing with his usual aggression, hitting Tendulkar for four in just his third ball. He carried on his aggression, {{treating}} Anil Kumble with disdain, smashing him for six, and then he hit a Tendulkar delivery for six as well. He was ably assisted by Simon Katich, who played sedately, and yet tackled the spinners comfortably. Gilchrist's aggression proved a perfect foil for Katich's calm strokeplay, as they mounted a stand of 71 runs from 15 overs. However, Gilchrist, {{in a moment of}} overconfidence, moved in front of the stumps to Kumble, exposing his leg-stump, which promptly got knocked over. Australia could still have hit back from 183/6, but then their tail succumbed to Ajit Agarkar, whose only claim to fame in his 18 test matches till then was the sobriquet of 'Bombay Duck', which was bestowed upon him for scoring seven ducks on the trot against Australia. Agarkar, came back for a new spell of 4 overs, in which he picked up a wicket off every over. He used the short ball judiciously and sparingly, and this tactic nailed the well-set Simon Katich, who had played a patient and a disciplined innings. For the tailenders, Agarkar bowled good-length deliveries on a consistent basis, which lured them to play aggressively, and as a result, Australia suffered. His spell with the old ball, was <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> the new ball, with which he [...] "confounded" [...] Matthew Hayden with the swing, and dismissed the two first innings accumulators, Ponting and Langer. Those four overs yielded only 13 runs, and Australia were bowled out for 196, while Agarkar picked up 6/41 from 16.2 overs.|$|E
