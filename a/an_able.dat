5|$|Despite these {{frightening}} character traits, however, Edward's contemporaries {{considered him}} <b>an</b> <b>able,</b> even an ideal, king. Though not loved by his subjects, he was feared and respected. He met contemporary expectations of kingship {{in his role}} as <b>an</b> <b>able,</b> determined soldier and in his embodiment of shared chivalric ideals. In religious observance he also fulfilled the expectations of his age: he attended chapel regularly and gave alms generously.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. VIII Corps {{had arrived}} in the United Kingdom in December 1943, and was {{commanded}} by Major General Emil F. Reinhardt, who Middleton had known for many years. While he was <b>an</b> <b>able</b> commander, his lack of combat experience resulted in his being replaced by Middleton (though Reinhardt would later command a division in the European fighting). Middleton's first stop in Europe before assuming command of VIII Corps was to confer with his friend and commander, Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower had asked Middleton about his views on making Patton the commander of an army. Middleton {{thought it was a good}} idea since Patton was such <b>an</b> <b>able</b> fighter. Eisenhower agreed, but was concerned about Patton's propensity to embarrass the Army by things he said to the press. Following this Patton was given command of the Third Army, which was headquartered north of London during the preparation for the invasion of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|After a {{prolonged}} struggle, by 1891 the Kalifa Abdallahi ibn Muhammad emerged as sole leader {{due to his}} support from the warlike nomadic Baggara Arabs of the west. He proved to be <b>an</b> <b>able</b> and ruthless ruler of the Mahdiyah, the Mahdist state. At first the state was run on military lines as a Jihadist state. Later, a more conventional form of administration was introduced. The Kalifa consolidated his rule in Sudan, then invaded Ethiopia, killing Emperor Yohannes IV in March 1889 and penetrating as far as Gondar. The same year, the Kalifa attacked Egypt at Tushki, but was defeated.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{reputation}} as <b>an</b> <b>able</b> politician and a likable man, during his presidency Pierce served only as a moderator among the increasingly bitter factions that were driving the nation towards civil war. To Pierce, who saw slavery as a question of property rather than morality, the Union was sacred; because of this, he saw the actions of abolitionists, and the more moderate Free Soilers, as divisive and {{as a threat to}} the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of southerners. Although he criticized those who sought to limit or end slavery, he rarely rebuked southern politicians who took extreme position or opposed northern interests.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} stages, the Anuradhapura Kingdom {{did not have}} a strong regular army except for a small body of soldiers. These were {{assigned}} for guarding the capital and the royal palace. The King had the right to demand <b>an</b> <b>able</b> bodied son for military service from every family in his kingdom. In times of war, a larger army was formed using this method. An army consisted of four main divisions; an elephant corps, cavalry, chariots and infantry. This combination was called Chaturangani Sena (fourfold army). However, the majority of the army was infantry composed of swordsmen, spearmen and archers.|$|E
5|$|His public enemies, {{even the}} men who {{directed}} the fatal shot, ne'er spoke or wrote of him without expressions of marked respect; those whom he commanded loved him even to idolatry; and I, his associate and commander, fail in words adequate to express my opinion of his great worth. I feel assured that every patriot in America, on hearing this sad news, will {{feel a sense of}} personal loss, and the country generally will realize that we have lost, not only <b>an</b> <b>able</b> military leader, but a man who, had he survived, was qualified to heal the national strife which has been raised by designing and ambitious men.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{reassessment}} of James {{in the past}} two decades, as <b>an</b> <b>able</b> ruler who extended royal power in Scotland and preserved his kingdoms from war throughout his reign, has been accompanied by a re-evaluation of Anne as an influential political figure and assertive mother, at least {{for as long as the}} royal marriage remained a reality. John Leeds Barroll argues in his cultural biography of Anne that her political interventions in Scotland were more significant, and certainly more troublesome, than previously noticed; and Clare McManus, among other cultural historians, has highlighted Anne's influential role in the Jacobean cultural flowering, not only as a patron of writers and artists but as a performer herself.|$|E

5|$|In Aden in May 1964, Hunter FGA.9s and FR.10s of No. 43 Squadron RAF and No. 8 Squadron RAF {{were used}} {{extensively}} during the Radfan campaign against insurgents attempting {{to overthrow the}} Federation of South Arabia. SAS forces would routinely call in air strikes that required considerable precision, and, predominantly using 3-inch high explosive rockets and 30mm ADEN cannon, the Hunter proved <b>an</b> <b>able</b> ground-attack platform. Both squadrons continued operations with their Hunters until the UK withdrew from Aden in November 1967.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{some circles}} within the US State Department viewed Arafat as <b>an</b> <b>able</b> diplomat and {{negotiator}} {{who could get}} support from many Arab governments at once.

Other pilots indicated they wanted him to stay in Korea, considering him to be <b>an</b> <b>able</b> and effective leader. However, the Air Force determined it had no capable replacement who could command Davis' squadron.|$|E

5|$|Joyce {{came from}} a humble {{seafaring}} background and began his naval career as a boy seaman in 1891. His Antarctic experiences began 10 years later, when he joined Scott's Discovery Expedition as <b>an</b> <b>Able</b> Seaman. In 1907 Shackleton recruited Joyce {{to take charge of}} dogs and sledges on the Nimrod Expedition. Subsequently Joyce was engaged in a similar capacity for Douglas Mawson's Australasian Antarctic Expedition in 1911, but left the expedition before it departed for the Antarctic. In 1914 Shackleton recruited Joyce for the Ross Sea party; despite his heroics this expedition marked the end of Joyce's association with the Antarctic, and of his exploring career, although he made repeated attempts to join other expeditions.|$|E
5|$|Like the board, {{which might}} be an ad hoc affair, the actual exam {{questions}} were not standardized and their content depended mostly on individual captains. In seamanship, the candidate {{was expected to be}} able to splice ropes, reef a sail, work a ship in sailing and shift his tides. In navigation, he was expected {{to be able to keep}} a reckoning of the ship's way by plane sailing, to use Mercator projection maps and observation of the sun and stars to determine the course and position of the ship, and to understand the variation of the compass. He was also expected to be qualified to do the duty of <b>an</b> <b>able</b> seaman and midshipman.|$|E
5|$|On the Endurance, {{the second}} in command was the {{experienced}} explorer Frank Wild. The meteorologist was Captain L. Hussey (also <b>an</b> <b>able</b> banjo player). Dr. McIlroy {{was head of the}} scientific staff, which included Wordie. Alexander Macklin was one of two surgeons and also in charge of keeping the 70 dogs healthy. Tom Crean was in more immediate charge as head dog-handler. Other crew included James, Hussey, Greenstreet, a carpenter Henry McNeish, and Clark (the biologist). Of later independent fame was the photographer Frank Hurley.|$|E

5|$|Performances for St Helens gained Trautmann a {{reputation}} as <b>an</b> <b>able</b> goalkeeper, resulting in interest from Football League clubs. As the following season commenced, a number of League clubs showed interest in signing him. The first to offer him a contract was Manchester City, a club playing in {{the highest level of}} football in the country, the First Division. On 7 October 1949 Trautmann signed for the club as an amateur and turned professional shortly after. Trautmann became the first sportsman in Britain to wear Adidas, thanks to his friendship with Adolf Dassler.|$|E
5|$|Robert rewarded Ranulf for {{his advice}} during the {{invasion}} by entrusting {{him with the}} administration of the see of Lisieux. After Robert's defeat by Henry at Tinchebray in 1106, the bishop {{was among the first to}} make his peace with Henry, and returned to Durham. He retired from political life. Henry had already replaced him with Roger of Salisbury <b>an</b> <b>able</b> financier who was infinitely more acceptable to the nation. Although some historians have theorised that Ranulf's time in Normandy was as an agent of Henry, it appears that Ranulf was mainly looking out for his own interests and those of his family.|$|E
5|$|Secretary of War Edwin Stanton was <b>an</b> <b>able</b> and {{hard-working}} man, but {{difficult to}} deal with. Johnson both admired and was exasperated by his War Secretary, who, in combination with General of the Army Grant, worked to undermine the president's Southern policy from within his own administration. Johnson considered firing Stanton, but respected him for his wartime service as secretary. Stanton, for his part, feared allowing Johnson to appoint his successor and refused to resign, despite his public disagreements with his president.|$|E
