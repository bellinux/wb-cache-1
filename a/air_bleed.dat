Mass transport in the gas flow channels, electrode backing and catalyst layers is accounted for, along with the adsorption, desorption and electro-oxidation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

Use of this material results in a simplified laminating process because removal by bleeding or prebleeding is no longer required.

The C-130E attempted to airdrop ammunition to surrounded South Vietnamese forces at An Loc, Vietnam. Approaching the drop zone, Spare 617 received heavy enemy ground fire that damaged two engines, ruptured a bleed air duct in the cargo compartment, and set the ammunition on fire. Flight engineer TSgt Sanders was killed, and navigator 1st Lt Lenz and co-pilot 1st Lt Hering were both wounded. Despite receiving severe burns from hot air escaping from the damaged <b>air</b> <b>bleed</b> duct, loadmaster TSgt Shaub extinguished a fire in the cargo compartment, and successfully jettisoned the cargo pallets, which exploded in mid-air. Despite losing a third engine on final approach, pilot Capt Caldwell landed Spare 617 safely.

50|$|Nitros engines {{typically}} use a carburetor to mix {{the fuel}} and air together, although for some applications where throttling is not required they have a simple venturi with a spraybar and needle valve. The carburetor can either be sliding or rotary. On a rotary carburetor, the slide is opened as the arm is turned by the servo. On a slide carburetor the slide is opened by sliding the arm out by the servo. Both are held open slightly by an idle screw which allows the engine to receive a very small amount of fuel to keep the engine running when the vehicle is at a stop. The carburetors usually feature 2 needles used to tune the mixture. A high speed needle tunes how much fuel is allowed into the carburetor at mid to high RPM, and a low speed needle determines how much fuel is allowed into the carburetor at low to mid range RPM. Turning either needle in a clockwise motion will thin the fuel mixture. Lean describes the amount of fuel in the fuel / air mixture. To a point this will make the engine run faster with better performance, but once too lean the engine will overheat, and wear out prematurely due to not receiving enough lubrication. Turning either needle counterclockwise will enrich the fuel mixture (unless the low speed needle is an <b>air</b> <b>bleed</b> {{in which case the}} opposite is true). Rich is the opposite of lean, it means more oil (fuel mixture) is entering the engine. If the engine is too rich, it will run poorly, and fuel that has not yet been burnt may start to spit out of the exhaust. The engine will run very slowly and seem to have no power and possibly cut out from being flooded with fuel. Although, being too rich is better than being too lean, because being too rich just means the engine is getting too much oil which is perfectly fine, although performance may not be as good as if the engine were lean. An excessively lean mixture can damage an engine in a short time, as it will run above its design temperature. A properly tuned engine will last a long time with good performance throughout its life.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the six-decade use of unfiltered aircraft <b>bleed</b> <b>air,</b> taken from jet engines to supply breathing {{air in the}} flight decks and passenger cabins of commercial and military transport aircraft. During this time, numerous flight safety issues and adverse effects from exposure to contaminated <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> have been reported. The research undertaken in this thesis examined previous investigations into these matters {{and the consequences of}} using <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> on flight safety and crew and passenger health. This research examined: (a) health issues reported by aircrew as a consequence of exposure to contaminated <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> whilst flying by way of several descriptive surveys; (b) various aviation air monitoring studies previously undertaken were reviewed to assess the knowledge base of the chemicals present during contaminated air events; (c) air sampling data were evaluated for their usefulness in determining any potential adverse health effects; (d) a review was undertaken of the frequency of contaminated <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> events; (e) a review was undertaken of some of the information known by the aviation industry and others about contaminated <b>bleed</b> <b>air.</b> Analysis of the evidence that <b>bleed</b> <b>air,</b> contaminated by synthetic jet engine oils and hydraulic fluids, is a regular and normal occurrence and far more common than previously accepted and is a consequence of the current <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> system design. There are significant short and longterm health effects being reported {{as a direct result of}} documented exposure events that validate claims of adverse health effects in exposed individuals. The thesis argues that the precautionary principle, occupational health and safety guidelines and aviation regulations are being ignored by the aviation industry, who continue to claim that cabin air is safe. The systemic misuse of available data is widespread, secondary to commercial objectives, and places passenger and crew health and flight safety at serious risk. The thesis concludes that the use of <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> on commercial aircraft with no form of contaminated air detection or filtration system present should be discontinued. The risk to health and flight safety is no longer acceptable...|$|R

40|$|Enhancement of polymer {{electrolyte}} {{fuel cell}} tolerance to CO impurities {{would allow the}} use of lower quality hydrogen, thus reducing the costs without compromising fuel cell performance. In this work, the effect of carbon monoxide is mitigated by combining different methods, including <b>air</b> <b>bleed,</b> varying the anode flow rate and using a state-of-the-art Pt-Ru catalyst at two operating temperatures. The tolerance was investigated by feeding a novel arrangement of segmented cells with hydrogen containing carbon monoxide less than 20 ppm.

It was discovered that increasing the volumetric flow rate of hydrogen and especially utilising ruthenium in the catalyst enhance the carbon monoxide tolerance.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} biogas-operated fuel cells. Fuel cell {{technology may}} contribute to more efficient energy use, reduce emissions and also perhaps revolutionize current energy systems. The technology is, however, still immature and {{has not yet been}} implemented as dominant in any application or niche market. Research and development is currently being carried out to investigate whether fuel cells can live up to their full potential and to further advance the technology. The research of thesis contributes by exploring the potential of using fuel cells as energy converters of biogas to electricity. The work includes results from four different experimental test facilities and concerns experiments performed at cell, stack and fuel cell system levels. The studies on cell and stack level have focused on the influence of CO, CO 2 and <b>air</b> <b>bleed</b> on the current distribution during transient operation. The dynamic response has been evaluated on a single cell, a segmented cell and at stack level. Two fuel cell systems, a 4 kW PEFC system and a 5 kW SOFC system have been operated on upgraded biogas. A significant outcome is that the possibility of operating both PEFCs and SOFCs on biogas has been established. No interruptions or rapid performance loss could be associated with the upgraded biogas during operation. From the studies at cell and stack level, it is clear that CO causes significant changes in the current distribution in a PEFC; <b>air</b> <b>bleed</b> may recover the uneven current distribution and also the drop in cell voltage due to CO and CO 2 poisoning. The recovery of cell performance during <b>air</b> <b>bleed</b> occurs evenly over the electrode surface even when the O 2 partial pressure is far too low to fully recover the CO poisoning. The O 2 supplied to the anode reacts on the anode catalyst and no O 2 was measured at the cell outlet for <b>air</b> <b>bleed</b> levels up to 5 %. Reformed biogas and other gases with high CO 2 content are thus, from dilution and CO-poisoning perspectives, suitable for PEFC systems. The present work has enhanced our understanding of biogas-operated fuel cells and will serve as basis for future studies. QC 2010070...|$|E
