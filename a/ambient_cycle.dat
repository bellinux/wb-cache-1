40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five chapters: Chapter 1 contains {{the basics of}} the theory and {{is essential for the}} rest of the thesis. Chapters 2 - 5 are to a large extent independent of each other and can be read separately. - Chapter 1 : Foundations of tropical intersection theory In this first chapter we set up the foundations of a tropical intersection theory covering many concepts and tools of its counterpart in algebraic geometry such as affine tropical cycles, Cartier divisors, morphisms of tropical cycles, pull-backs of Cartier divisors, push-forwards of cycles and an intersection product of Cartier divisors and cycles. Afterwards, we generalize these concepts to abstract tropical cycles and introduce a concept of rational equivalence. Finally, we set up an intersection product of cycles and prove that every cycle is rationally equivalent to some affine cycle in the special case that our <b>ambient</b> <b>cycle</b> is R^n. We use this result to show that rational and numerical equivalence agree in this case and prove a tropical Bézout's theorem. - Chapter 2 : Tropical cycles with real slopes and numerical equivalence In this chapter we generalize our definitions of tropical cycles to polyhedral complexes with non-rational slopes. We use this new definition to show that if our <b>ambient</b> <b>cycle</b> is a fan then every subcycle is numerically equivalent to some affine cycle. Finally, we restrict ourselves to cycles in R^n that are "generic" in some sense and study the concept of numerical equivalence in more detail. - Chapter 3 : Tropical intersection products on smooth varieties We define an intersection product of tropical cycles on tropical linear spaces L^n_k and on other, related fans. Then, we use this result to obtain an intersection product of cycles on any "smooth" tropical variety. Finally, we use the intersection product to introduce a concept of pull-backs of cycles along morphisms of smooth tropical varieties and prove that this pull-back has all expected properties. - Chapter 4 : Weil and Cartier divisors under tropical modifications First, we introduce "modifications" and "contractions" and study their basic properties. After that, we prove that under some further assumptions a one-to-one correspondence of Weil and Cartier divisors is preserved by modifications. In particular we can prove that on any smooth tropical variety we have a one-to-one correspondence of Weil and Cartier divisors. - Chapter 5 : Chern classes of tropical vector bundles We give definitions of tropical vector bundles and rational sections of tropical vector bundles. We use these rational sections to define the Chern classes of such a tropical vector bundle. Moreover, we prove that these Chern classes have all expected properties. Finally, we classify all tropical vector bundles on an elliptic curve up to isomorphisms. Tropische Schnitttheori...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{continuation}} of part I in the series (in progress) of the papers on Lagrangian Floer theory on toric manifolds. Using the deformations of Floer cohomology by the <b>ambient</b> <b>cycles,</b> which we call bulk deformations, we find a continuum of non-displaceable Lagrangian fibers on some compact toric manifolds. We also provide a method of finding all those fibers in arbitrary compact toric manifolds, which we call bulk-balanced Lagrangian fibers...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study Lagrangian Floer theory on toric {{manifolds}} {{from the point}} of view of mirror symmetry. We construct a natural isomorphism between the Frobenius manifold structures of the (big) quantum cohomology of the toric manifold and of Saito's theory of singularities of the potential function constructed in fooo 09 via the Floer cohomology deformed by <b>ambient</b> <b>cycles.</b> Our proof of the isomorphism involves the open-closed Gromov-Witten theory of one-loop.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we first develop various {{enhancements}} {{of the theory}} of spectral invariants of Hamiltonian Floer homology and of Entovi-Polterovich theory of spectral symplectic quasi-states and quasimorphisms by incorporating bulk deformations, i. e., deformations by <b>ambient</b> <b>cycles</b> of symplectic manifolds, of the Floer homology and quantum cohomology. Essentially the same kind of construction is independently carried out by Usher [Us 4] in a slightly less general context. Then we explore various applications of these enhancements to the symplectic topology, especially new construction of symplectic quasi-states, quasimorphisms and new Lagrangian intersection results on toric manifolds. The most novel part {{of this paper is to}} use open-closed Gromov-Witten theory (operator q in [FOOO 1] and its variant involving closed orbits of periodic Hamiltonian system) to connect spectral invariants (with bulk deformation), symplectic quasi-states, quasimorphism to the Lagrangian Floer theory (with bulk deformation). We use this open-closed Gromov-Witten theory to produce new examples. Especially using the calculation of Lagrangian Floer homology with bulk deformation in [FOOO 3,FOOO 4], we produce examples of compact toric manifolds (M,ω) which admits uncountably many independent quasimorphisms Ham(M,ω) → R. We also obtain a new intersection result of Lagrangian submanifolds on S^ 2 × S^ 2 discovered in [FOOO 6]. Many of these applications were announced in [FOOO 3,FOOO 4,FOOO 6].

40|$|AbstractWhile piezoresistive sensing {{has been}} {{increasingly}} recognized as affording substantially higher electromechanical conversion over capacitive sensing, hot carriers {{injected into the}} device could potentially introduce noise and instabilities in frequency. In this paper, {{it is found that}} the frequency drifts tracked over time in a dog-bone resonator employing piezoresistive sensing are most likely due to <b>ambient</b> temperature <b>cycles.</b> Drifts due to carrier injection were unobservable in comparison at least at moderate current level (0. 82 mA, corresponding to 97. 5 μW of power). These observations were obtained by tracking both the resonant frequency and ambient temperature simultaneously and correlating these trends to the measured temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of the device (- 13 ppm/K) ...|$|R
30|$|Inter-seasonal {{heat storage}} {{can be an}} {{effective}} tool to reduce heating peaks in dwellings in winter period [28 – 34]. Indeed, solar heating potential is high in summer and low in winter, what is just opposite to heat demand (see e.g. Fig.  1 in ref. [35]), therefore a long-term (several months) storage of the excess heat in simmer is needed. The inter-seasonal AHS can operate as closed (evacuated) [36] and open (coupled to the <b>ambient)</b> [37] <b>cycles.</b> Useful comparison of these two AHS variations was performed in [38] by using energy and exergy balance analysis. The authors clearly demonstrated that the adsorptive systems may be as efficient as, and more compact than other types of the thermal energy storage systems, however, there is a much room for efficiency improvement for both closed and open AHS systems.|$|R
5000|$|Rodent {{studies have}} shown that the master brain clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is {{functional}} in the fetus before the fetal brain is capable of registering the presence of light. Reppert and colleagues reported that the fetal SCN is entrained to the light-dark cycle before the retinohypothalamic pathway innervates the SCN from the eye. [...] This finding indicates that the mother, and her entrainment to <b>ambient</b> light-dark <b>cycles,</b> provides the necessary information to the fetus for synchronization. As Reppert states, “Mom is functioning as the transducer for the fetal circadian system. She takes in light information to her circadian system, and then that is communicated to the fetal circadian system.” This fetal entrainment persists into the postnatal period and ensures that neonatal behavioral patterns are properly tuned with the environment. Dopamine and melatonin can both act as perinatal maternal entraining signals.|$|R

The {{differences in the}} performance are considered together {{with the type of}} application for which the gas turbine is built and operated. Comparisons with some commercial gas turbines are also presented. Performance variations produced by changes in ambient conditions are addressed, because most of the performance curves, provided by gas turbine manufacturers, present data as a function of ambient temperature. Control techniques that minimize the effect of <b>ambient</b> conditions on <b>cycle</b> performance of single- and dual-shaft gas turbines are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Water {{temperature}} was elevated and maintained {{in two of}} three fish production systems which incorporated biofiltration and hydroponics. Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) were stocked in indoor fish tanks and fed to satiation once daily. Tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum) were planted in outdoor hydroponic tanks. The study was conducted during the 1979 growing season. Afternoon water temperature averaged 25 °C in the control system and 28 °C in both experimental systems. The temperature in the control unit varied with the <b>ambient</b> diel <b>cycle,</b> whereas {{the temperature in the}} two experimental units remained constant. The mechanics of the system were satisfactory and the plants showed no adverse effects associated with the heated water. The total fruit yield (in kilograms per plant) was similar in all systems: control, 8. 9; experimental A, 9. 1; and experimental B, 9. 1. Growth of the yearling fish was enhanced by the constant elevated temperature. The respective average rates of growth from 15 May to 22 June in the control system and experimental systems A and B were 0. 96, 1. 47, and 1. 06 g/day per fish...|$|R

PMMA samples are submitted to successive heat–cooling cycles (Tmin= 20  ∘C and Tmax= 90  ∘C) in the <b>ambient</b> air, each <b>cycle</b> lasts 12 h. Different techniques are thus employed to investigate structural modifications, dielectric relaxations and conduction processes. These are the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermal step method (TSM), thermally stimulated depolarization currents (TSDC), dielectric spectroscopy (DS) and current–voltage technique. Results are discussed and a relationship between structural modifications and charge relaxations was emphasized. We demonstrated that thermal aging favors oxidation phenomenon.

40|$|In a {{laboratory}} environment, it is cost prohibitive to run automotive battery aging experiments {{across a wide}} range of possible <b>ambient</b> environment, drive <b>cycle</b> and charging scenarios. Since worst-case scenarios drive the conservative sizing of electric-drive vehicle batteries, it is useful to understand how and why those scenarios arise and what design or control actions might be taken to mitigate them. In an effort to explore this problem, this paper applies a semi-empirical life model of the graphite/nickel-cobalt-aluminum lithium-ion chemistry to investigate impacts of geographic environments under storage and simplified cycling conditions. The model is then applied to analyze complex cycling conditions, using battery charge/discharge profiles generated from simulations of PHEV 10 and PHEV 40 vehicles across 782 single-day driving cycles taken from Texas travel survey data...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a numerical implementation {{of star formation}} in disc galaxies, in which the conversion of cooling gas to stars in the multiphase interstellar medium is governed by {{the rate at which}} molecular clouds are formed and destroyed. In the model, clouds form from thermally unstable ambient gas and get destroyed by feedback from massive stars and thermal conduction. Feedback in the <b>ambient</b> phase <b>cycles</b> gas into a hot galactic fountain or wind. We model the ambient gas hydrodynamically using smoothed particle hydrodynamics. However, we cannot resolve the Jeans mass in the cold and dense molecular gas and, therefore, represent the cloud phase with ballistic particles that coagulate when colliding. We show that this naturally produces a multiphase medium with cold clouds, a warm disc, hot supernova bubbles and a hot, tenuous halo. Our implementation of this model is based on the gadget N-body code. We illustrate the model by evolving an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy and study the properties of a disc formed in a rotating spherical collapse. Many observed properties of disc galaxies are reproduced well, including the molecular cloud mass spectrum, the molecular fraction as a function of radius, the Schmidt law, the stellar density profile and the appearance of a galactic fountain...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanisms}} {{and consequences of}} synchrony among heterogeneous oscillators are poorly understood in biological systems. We present a multicellular, molecular model of the mammalian circadian clock that incorporates recent data implicating the neurotransmitter vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) as the key synchronizing agent. The model postulates that synchrony arises among circadian neurons because they release VIP rhythmically {{on a daily basis}} and in response to ambient light. Two basic cell types, intrinsically rhythmic pacemakers and damped oscillators, are assumed to arise from a distribution of Period gene transcription rates. Postsynaptic neurons show time-of-day dependent responses to VIP binding through a signaling cascade that activates Period mRNA transcription. The heterogeneous cell ensemble model self-synchronizes, entrains to <b>ambient</b> light-dark <b>cycles,</b> and desynchronizes in constant bright light or upon removal of VIP signaling. The degree of synchronicity observed depends on cell-specific features (e. g., mean and variability of parameters within the rhythm-generating loop), in addition to the more commonly studied effect of intercellular coupling strength. These simulations closely replicate experimental data and predict that heterogeneous oscillations (e. g., sustained, damped, and arrhythmic) arise from small differences in the molecular parameters between cells, that damped oscillators participate in entrainment and synchrony of the ensemble of cells, and that constant light desynchronizes oscillators by maximizing VIP release...|$|R
40|$|The {{significance}} of temperature on aquatic species ecology and physiology is well recognized yet {{its effects on}} chemical bioaccumulation kinetics are less well understood under natural conditions. In this study, yellow perch were dosed with a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture and allowed to depurate the chemicals over 1 year under an <b>ambient</b> temperature <b>cycle</b> characteristic of northern temperate latitudes. PCB elimination kinetics {{during the summer months}} at optimal water temperature for perch (23 °C) were similar to those observed in lab studies with other species reared at their optimal temperature. During the fall and winter seasons, however, elimination of only 11 PCB congeners of log Kow ≤ 5. 7 was observed and half-lives averaged 3 ̆e 1000 d for these PCBs. PCB elimination was again observed with the onset of spring temperatures but elimination rates averaged 2. 6 times slower for readily metabolized congeners and 7. 5 times slower for more persistent PCBs than observed during the summer. Bioenergetics modeling efforts predicted maximum values for respiration, fecal egestion, and growth rates during summer months but also predicted rapid declines in these chemical dilution processes during the fall and winter concurrent with changes in temperature. As temperature increased into the spring, bioenergetic rates were predicted to increase but only achieved ∼ 85...|$|R

5000|$|It is {{very rare}} that a coil would just stop working in an {{electromagnetic}} coupling [...] Typically, if a coil fails it is usually due to heat which has caused the insulation of the coil wire to break down. The heat {{can be caused by}} high <b>ambient</b> temperature, high <b>cycle</b> rates, slipping or applying too high of a voltage. Bushings can be used in some clutches that have low speed, low side loads or low operating hours. At higher loads and speeds, bearing mounted field/rotors and hubs are a better option. Most brakes are flanged mounted and have bearings but some brakes are bearing mounted. Like the coils, unless bearings are stressed beyond their physical limitations or become contaminated, they tend to have a long life and they are usually the second item to wear out.|$|R
40|$|Timing is essential, but {{circadian}} clocks, which play {{a crucial}} role in timekeeping, are almost unaddressed in evolutionary ecology. A key property of circadian clocks is their free-running period length (τ), i. e. the time taken for a full cycle under constant conditions. Under laboratory conditions, concordance of τ with the <b>ambient</b> light–dark <b>cycle</b> confers major fitness benefits, but little is known about period length and its implications in natural populations. We therefore studied natural variation of circadian traits in a songbird, the great tit (Parus major), by recording locomotor activity of 98 hand-raised, wild-derived individuals. We found, unexpectedly, that the free-running period of this diurnal species was significantly shorter than 24 h in constant dim light. We furthermore demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time in a wild vertebrate, ample genetic variation and high heritability (h 2 = 0. 86 ± 0. 24), implying that period length is potentially malleable by micro-evolutionary change. The observed, short period length may be a consequence of sexual selection, as offspring from extra-pair matings had significantly shorter free-running periods than their half-siblings from within-pair matings. These findings position circadian clocks in the ‘real world’ and underscore the value of using chronobiological approaches in evolutionary ecology. Evolutionary ecologists study variation and its fitness consequences, but often have difficulties relating behavioural variation to physiological mechanisms. The findings presented here open the possibility that properties of internal, circadian clocks affect performance in traits that are relevant to fitness and sexual selection. ...|$|R
40|$|Avian {{behavior}} and physiology {{are embedded in}} time at many levels of biological organization. Biological clock function in birds is critical for sleep/wake cycles, but may also regulate the acquisition of place memory, learning of song from tutors, social integration and time-compensated navigation. This relationship has two major implications. First, mechanisms of the circadian clock should be linked {{in some way to}} the mechanisms of all these behaviors. How is not yet clear, and evidence that the central clock has effects is piecemeal. Second, selection acting on characters that are linked to the circadian clock should influence aspects of the clock mechanism itself. Little evidence exists for this in birds, but there have been few attempts to assess this idea. At its core, the avian circadian clock is a multi-oscillator system comprising the pineal gland, the retinae and the avian homologues of the suprachiasmatic nuclei, whose mutual interactions ensure coordinated physiological functions, which are in turn synchronized to <b>ambient</b> light <b>cycles</b> via encephalic, pineal and retinal photoreceptors. At the molecular level, avian biological clocks comprise a genetic network of positive elements clock and bmal 1 whose interactions with the negative elements period 2, period 3 and the cryptochromes form an oscillatory feedback loop that circumnavigates the 24 hrs of the day. We assess the possibilities for dual integration of the clock with time-dependent cognitive processes. Closer examination of the molecular, physiological, and behavioral elements of the circadian system would place birds at a very interesting fulcrum in the neurobiology of time in learning, memory and navigation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{circadian}} {{clock in}} the mammalian hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is entrained by the <b>ambient</b> light/dark <b>cycle,</b> which differentially acts to cause the clock to advance or delay. Light-induced changes in the rhythmic expression of SCN clock genes {{are believed to be}} a critical step in this process, but how the two entrainment modalities [...] advances vs. delays [...] engage the molecular clockwork remains incompletely understood. We investigated molecular substrates of photic entrainment of the {{clock in the}} SCN by stably entraining hamsters to T cycles (non- 24 -h light/dark cycles) consisting of a single 1 -h light pulse repeated as either a short (23. 33 -h) or a long (24. 67 -h) cycle; under these conditions, the light pulse of the short cycle acts as 2 ̆ 2 dawn, 2 ̆ 2 whereas that of the long cycle acts as 2 ̆ 2 dusk. 2 ̆ 2 Analyses of the expression of the photoinducible and rhythmic clock genes Period 1 and 2 (Per 1 and Per 2) in the SCN revealed fundamental differences under these two entrainment modes. Light at dawn advanced the clock, advancing the onset of the Per 1 mRNA rhythm and acutely increasing mRNA transcription, whereas light at dusk delayed the clock, delaying the offset of the Per 2 mRNA rhythm and tonically increasing mRNA stability. The results suggest that the underlying molecular mechanisms of circadian entrainment differ with morning (advancing) or evening (delaying) light exposure, and such differences may reflect how entrainment takes place in nocturnal animals under natural conditions...|$|R
40|$|Temperatures in {{the forest}} litter of Noway spruce Picea abies were {{recorded}} throughout the day to obtain environmental parameters {{that could be used}} to design realistic flight-activity experiments in the laboratory. Flight activity and survival were monitored electronically in plastic chambers where the conditions were controlled by an environmental chamber. Flight attempts of the bark beetle Ips typographus were initially lower in chambers with forest duff but were prolonged compared with those of beetles in chambers with a metal screen substrate. Small bark slabs and spruce twigs in the duff were utilized as food and extended the period of flight and survival. A thermal gradient in duff from 25 " at the surface down to 13. 8 "C at a depth of 4 cm also slightly increased the survival of beetles compared with a constant 25 ". A daily <b>ambient</b> temperature <b>cycle</b> as well as the duff thermal gradient increased the survival from about 3 d to more than 8 d. The latter length in the laboratory agreed with survival rates of caged beetles in a clearcut forest area, while beetles caged {{in the forest}} survival for more than 14 d. Temperatures were monitored at the duff surface of the caged beetles and compared with the catches of beetles that were attracted to a pheromone trap and collected with an electronic fraction collector.

40|$|Over {{the past}} fifty years, most poultry in the UK have been managed in {{specialist}} indoor systems and excluded {{as a significant}} enterprise from most other farm types. This meant {{that there was little}} information on how to integrate poultry into land-based systems such as organic production. This Defra project OF 0163 aimed to assess methods of integrating organic poultry into crop rotations, taking into account the need to meet the birds’ nutritional and physiological requirements for health and performance, the recycling of nutrients between soil, plants and birds and practical limitations of the system. Objectives 1. 	To review the scientific literature available on home grown protein sources so as to identify their maximum inclusion rates in organic poultry rations (laying hens and table chickens). 2. 	To measure nitrogen retention and to determine the nutrient content of manure from slow growing meat birds fed non limiting rations versus Label Rouge rations. 3. 	To measure nitrogen retention and to determine the nutrient content of manure in slow growing meat birds housed at a stable thermoneutral temperature versus a daily <b>ambient</b> temperature <b>cycle</b> during late autumn/winter months. 4. 	To review the scientific information available so as to determine the optimum position for poultry in whole farm rotations. 5. 	To provide examples of enterprise costings, including gross margins over variable costs, for mixed farms on a “with poultry” (laying hens and table chickens, separately) and “without poultry” basis. 6. 	To disseminate information on poultry management techniques as they apply to an organic system of egg production and table chicken production.

40|$|Melatonin, the pineal gland hormone, {{provides}} entrainment of many circadian rhythms to the <b>ambient</b> light/dark <b>cycle.</b> Recently, cardiovascular {{studies have}} demostrated melatonin interactions with many physiological processes and diseases, such as hypertension and cardiopathologies. Although membrane melatonin receptors (MT 1, MT 2) and the transcriptional factor ROR alpha {{have been reported}} to be expressed in the heart, {{there is no evidence of}} the cell-type expressing receptors as well as the possible role of melatonin on the expression of the circadian clock of cardiomyocytes, which play an important role in cardiac metabolism and function. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the mRNA and protein expressions of MT 1, MT 2, and ROR alpha and to determine whether melatonin directly influences expression of circadian clocks within cultured rat cardiomyocytes. Adult rat cardiomyocyte cultures were created, and the cells were stimulated with 1 nM melatonin or vehicle. Gene expressions were assayed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The mRNA and protein expressions of membrane melatonin receptors and RORa were established within adult rat cardiomyocytes. Two hours of melatonin stimulation did not alter the expression pattern of the analyzed genes. However, given at the proper time, melatonin kept Rev-erb alpha expression chronically high, specifically 12 h after melatonin treatment, avoiding the rhythmic decline of Rev-erb alpha mRNA. The blockage of MT 1 and MT 2 by luzindole did not alter the observed melatonin-induced expression of Rev-erb alpha mRNA, suggesting the nonparticipation of MT 1 and MT 2 on the melatonin effect within cardiomyocytes. It is possible to speculate that melatonin, in adult rat cardiomyocytes, may play an important role in the light signal transduction to peripheral organs, such as the heart, modulating its intrinsic rhythmicity.

40|$|Amphibian populations {{worldwide}} {{are currently}} experiencing unprecedented declines {{due to the}} combined effects of emerging infectious disease and climate change. The skin is {{the first line of}} defence in preventing establishment of pathogens and associated infections. Although amphibians undergo regular sloughing of the outer layer of the skin, the potential for regular sloughing {{to play a role in}} influencing cutaneous microbial populations and pathogens has been largely overlooked. In the present study, we assessed the effect of skin sloughing on cultivable cutaneous bacterial abundance in the green tree frog (Litoria caerulea). We also examined the effects of temperature and hydric environment on sloughing frequency and microbial re-establishment rates. Our data showed that cultivable cutaneous bacterial abundance was significantly reduced by sloughing events, and frogs kept at 2 ̆ 7 summer 2 ̆ 7 temperatures (23 - 33 degrees C) sloughed almost twice as frequently as those maintained at 2 ̆ 7 winter 2 ̆ 7 temperatures (13 - 23 degrees C). No effect of hydric environment on sloughing frequency was observed, but we did find that sloughing in L. caerulea appeared to be linked to <b>ambient</b> light <b>cycles.</b> Examination of the effect of sloughing on microbial recolonization indicated that at cool temperatures, an extended intermoult interval allowed microbial abundance to reach higher levels than at warmer ` summer 2 ̆ 7 temperatures (when the intermoult interval was significantly reduced). Our data suggest that sloughing may significantly influence the establishment and/or maintenance of cutaneous bacterial populations (pathogenic, mutualistic and/or commensal) and this, in turn, may be affected by environmental factors, such as ambient light and temperature. These findings are likely to be important for our understanding of the ecology of skin-based pathogens, such as the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis...|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} of microelectronic circuits, their scale of integration, and clock speed re quirements have been increasing steadily. All {{of these changes}} {{have the effect of}} increasing the power density of the micro-circuits. IC's with a power of several watts and area of over a square centimeter are quite common. Thus, there is more heat generated per device at die, component, and substrate-attach levels of electronic packaging. In order to maintain reliability of finished products, the junction temperature of the con stituent devices must be kept low. It has been demonstrated that thermal management can be one key to lowering the cost and increasing the performance life of microelectronic products. The cost effectiveness of lowering device temperature has been demonstrated to be dramatic in comparison to the cost of thermal management materials(l, 2). Proper thermal management of advanced microelectronic devices has to be addressed at all levels. One should address the problem from the basic level of die-attach, through com ponent attach, and eventually substrate-attach to thermal drains. Thermal management is almost invariably coupled with a thermally induced stress problem. The increase in temperature at the device level also means a larger fluctuation of tempera ture from the <b>ambient.</b> Each <b>cycle</b> of on-off for the device represents one thermal cycle. Stress induced failures due to coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch is much more acute for higher power devices. In this paper, we will also address the thermally induced stress on the microelectronic product at all levels of packaging with major emphasis on component and substrate levels. We will demonstrate various ways and examples of reducing or eliminating this stress, which is a major cause of device failures. One of the proven methods is through the use of low Tg epoxies with high thermal stability...|$|R

Exergy analysis based on second law {{was applied to}} the gas cycle and individual components through a modeling approach. The analysis shows that the highest exergy destruction occurs in the combustion chamber (CC). In addition, the effects of the gas turbine load and performance variations with ambient temperature, compression ratio and turbine inlet temperature (TIT) are investigated to analyse the change in system behavior. The analysis shows that the gas turbine is significantly affected by the ambient temperature and with increase there is decrease in GT power output. The results of the load variation of the gas turbine show that a reduction in gas turbine load results in a decrease in the exergy efficiency of the cycle as well as all the components. The compressor has the largest exergy efficiency of 92. 84 % compared to the other component of the GT and combustion chamber is the highest source of exergy destruction of 109. 89 MW at 100 % load condition.

The MEDAD cycle results in a quantum increase of distillate production at the same top-brine condition. Being lower than the ambient temperature for the bottom stages of hybrid <b>cycle,</b> <b>ambient</b> energy can now be scavenged by the MED processes whilst the AD cycle is powered by low temperature waste heat from exhaust or renewable sources.

All system states are monitored including the distillate production and power consumption and the measured results are expressed in terms of performance ratio (PR). It is observed that the synergetic matching of MEDAD cycle led to a quantum increase in distillate production, up to 2. 5 to 3 folds vis-a-vis to a conventional MED of the same rating. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Re-entry {{vehicles}} generally require {{control surfaces}} (e. g., rudders, body flaps) to steer them during flight. Control surface seals are installed along hinge lines and where control surface edges move {{close to the}} vehicle body. These seals must operate at high temperatures and limit heat transfer to underlying structures {{to prevent them from}} overheating and causing possible loss of vehicle structural integrity. This paper presents results for thermal analyses and mechanical testing conducted on the baseline rudder/fin seal design for the X- 38 re-entry vehicle. Exposure of the seals in a compressed state at the predicted peak seal temperature of 1900 F resulted in loss of seal resiliency. The vertical Inconel rudder/fin rub surface was re-designed to account for this loss of resiliency. Room temperature compression tests revealed that seal unit loads and contact pressures were below limits set to protect Shuttle thermal tiles on the horizontal sealing surface. The seals survived an <b>ambient</b> temperature 1000 <b>cycle</b> scrub test over sanded Shuttle tiles and were able to disengage and re-engage the tile edges during testing. Arc jet tests confirmed the need for seals in the rudder/fin gap location because a single seal caused a large temperature drop (delta T = 1710 F) in the gap...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the notion of {{creating}} personally evocative collections of content from publicly available material. Compared to the personal media that we look at, reminisce over, or personalise our offices with, public media offers {{the potential for a}} different type of nostalgia, signifiers of an era such as entertainment, products, or fashions. We focus on an office environment, where the use of filtered public media may mitigate concerns over protecting privacy and disclosing too much of one's identity, while keeping the existing benefits of office personalisation in terms of reminiscence, improving mood, and developing identity. After preliminary explorations of content and form, we developed a two-screen <b>ambient</b> display that <b>cycled</b> through 500 images automatically retrieved based on four simple user questions. We ran a two-week trial of the display with six users. We present qualitative results of the trial from which we see {{that it is possible to}} bring the delight associated with personal content into the workplace, while being mindful of issues of appropriateness and privacy. Images of locations from childhood were particularly evocative for all participants, while simple objects such as stickers, music, or boardgames were more varied across participants. We discuss a number of avenues for future work in the workplace and beyond: improving the chance of an evocative moment, capturing the mundane, and the crowdsourcing of nostalgia.

40|$|Single stage {{air source}} heat pump {{has been widely}} used around the world. However, it has some drawback, for example, {{deteriorated}} heating capacity and COP in cold ambient temperature. To overcome these disadvantages, cascade cycle has been suggested and shows better performance at low <b>ambient</b> temperature. Cascade <b>cycle</b> has smaller compression ratio at each cycle and shows higher compression efficiency compared to that of single stage cycle. Intermediate pressure is most critical parameter which decides the system performance. There have been many research studies about cascade heat pump system using NH 3 /CO 2 and C 3 H 8 /CO 2 as refrigerants at high and low stage, respectively. Most studies conducted on system optimization, finding the optimal intermediate pressure. However, little information has given about the experimental optimization results. In this study, AWHP (air to water heat pump), which is composed by two single stage cycle, was studied experimentally. AWHP high and low cycle adopts R 134 a and R 410 A as refrigerants, respectively, because critical temperature of R 134 a is higher than R 410 A. Since there are two single stage cycles, each cycle has a different compression ratio. In this research, by introducing numerical analysis, system optimization was studied. Characteristics of cascade cycle with respect to each compressor have been also studied. Experiment was conducted with various operating conditions; ambient temperature, water inlet temperature...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of direct and indirect cooling in conjunction with natural draft dry cooling towers (NDDCT) for the heat rejection of a supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO) recompression Brayton cycle. One dimensional models were developed for direct and indirect cooling NDDCTs. The inlet conditions to the heat rejection system that correspond to the peak cycle efficiency for the scenario considered were identified and {{used to determine the}} minimum NDDCT size for direct and indirect cooling. The direct cooling configuration requires a smaller tower than indirect cooling, due to the much higher temperature difference between the two fluid streams. When analysed in isolation the direct cooling NDDCT is found to over cool at both high and low inlet temperatures. The direct and indirect dry cooled recompression cycles were analysed at a range of ambient temperatures, using a coupled NDDCT and cycle model approach, in order to represent daily and annual variances. In both direct and indirect configurations, the cycle is overcooled at low <b>ambient</b> temperature, reducing <b>cycle</b> efficiency. A novel bypass arrangement was proposed that allows control of the compressor inlet temperature by reducing heat rejection from the tower, and allows both cycles to maintain peak efficiency at low ambient temperatures. At the design point ambient temperature of 20 °C the cycle efficiency is 49. 6 %. This is maintained down to 0 °C for both configurations, and drops to 44. 7 % and 43. 8 % at 50 °C ambient for direct and indirect respectively...|$|R
40|$|A multi-variable {{optimization}} {{program has}} been developed to investigate the performance of Organic Rankine Cycles (ORCs) for low temperature heat recovery applications using both turbine and twin-screw expanders when account is taken of performance variation due to changes in <b>ambient</b> conditions. The <b>cycle</b> simulation contains thermodynamic models of both types of expander. In {{the case of the}} twin-screw machine, the methods used to match the operation of the expander to the requirements of the cycle are described. The performance of turbine expanders in a superheated ORC has been modelled using correlations derived from operational data for single stage reaction turbines to predict the turbine efficiency at "off-design" conditions. Several turbine configurations have been considered including variable nozzle area and variable speed. The capability of the cycle model has been demonstrated for the case of heat recovery from a steady source of pressurized hot water at 120 °C. The system parameters are optimised for a typical operating condition, which determines the required size of heat exchangers and the expander characteristics. Performance at off-design conditions can then be optimized within these constraints. This allows a rigorous investigation of the effect of air temperature variation on the system performance, and the seasonal variation in net power output for the turbine and twin-screw ORC systems. A case study is presented for a low temperature heat recovery application with system electrical power output of around 100 kWe at design conditions. The results indicate that similar overall performance can be achieved for ORC systems using either type of expander...|$|R
40|$|Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate-Diaphorase (NADPH-d) expressing neurons in {{the retina}} of golden hamsters have been {{identified}} to be a subset of amacrine cells that provide {{a major source of}} Nitric Oxide (NO) in retina. This subset of amacrine cells in mouse retina was recently proved to contain the circadian clock gene Per 1 (D. Q. Zhang, T. Zhou, G. X. Ruan, D. G. McMahon, Circadian rhythm of Period 1 clock gene expression in NOS amacrine cells of the mouse retina, Brain Res., 1050 (2005) 101 - 109). However, it remains unknown whether these clock-related NADPH-d amacrine cells can be regulated by light stimulation and thus synchronized to <b>ambient</b> day/night <b>cycle.</b> A previous study has reported that NADPH-d expressing amacrine cells in postnatal hamsters exhibited a surge after eye-opening (D. Tay, Y. C. Diao, Y. M. Xiao, K. F. So, Postnatal development of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase-positive neurons in the retina of the golden hamster, J. Comp. Neurol., 446 (2002) 342 - 348) suggesting a possible effect of light on the NADPH-d amacrine cells. In order to further reveal the relationship between NADPH-d amacrine cells and light stimulation, the present study focuses on the changes of the expression of NADPH-d in the retina of postnatal hamsters reared in completely deprived light conditions. Prior to eye opening, P 12 hamster pups were subjected to either bilateral eyelid suturing or dark rearing. On P 28 a subgroup of light deprived hamsters was returned to lighting conditions and the expression of NADPH-d activities in the retina was assessed. In hamsters reared in the 12 : 12 light-dark cycle, the number of NADPH-d amacrine cells in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) increased right after eye-opening and reached the adult level gradually. However, hamsters subjected to both bilateral eyelid suturing and dark rearing, the number of NADPH-d amacrine cells in GCL was maintained at a low level but increased again upon returning to the 12 : 12 light-dark condition. In contrast, the number of NADPH-d expressing amacrine cells in the inner nuclear layer (INL) remained low and unaltered regardless of the lighting environment. This study demonstrates that there are two subpopulations of NADPH-d expressing amacrine cells with respect to different locations in the retina of hamsters. Different from those in INL, the NADPH-d amacrine cells in GCL of postnatal hamsters are dependent on the lighting environment implicating that these clock-related amacrine cells and the production of NO might be under a modulation of light stimulation. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Biological rhythms are {{a result}} of interplay between {{endogenous}} clocks and the <b>ambient</b> light-dark (LD) <b>cycle.</b> Biological timing in resident polar organisms presents a conundrum because these experience distinct daily LD cycles for only a few weeks each year. We measured locomotor activity in reindeer, Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus (SR, n = 5 and 6) and R. tarandus tarandus (NR, n = 6), ranging freely at 78 and 70 degrees N, respectively, continuously throughout 1 year using data loggers. NR, but not SR, are gregarious which enabled us to examine the integrated effects of differences in social organisation and the photic environment at two different latitudes on the organisation of activity. In both sub-species, ultradian bouts of activity and inactivity alternated across the 24 -h day throughout the year. This pattern was modified by the LD cycle in NR but barely at all in SR. Periodogram analysis revealed significant ultradian rhythmicity in both sub-species; the frequency of daily cycles of activity increased from three per day in winter to nearly five in summer. We conclude that this increase, and a concomitant increase in the level of daily activity, reflected the seasonal increase in the animals' appetite and the quality of their forage. Secondly, the combination, most evident in SR, of a weak photic response, weak circadian mechanisms and a weak social synchronization reduces the constraints of biological timing in an environment which is effectively non-rhythmic most of the year and permits expression of the basic ultradian pattern of ruminant activity. Third, the weaker 24 -h rhythmicity in SR compared to NR indicates a latitudinal decrease in circadian organization and photic responsiveness in Rangifer...|$|R
