5000|$|While {{there has}} been a clear {{consensus}} on the book's significant scholarly contributions, some of the book's theses have also been criticized by Rayyan Al-Shawaf, <b>a</b> <b>freelance</b> <b>writer</b> and reviewer <b>living</b> in Beirut, who concedes that Massad makes a few good points, but observes that [...] "Massad’s relativism - stemming from his accurate observation that ‘homosexuality’ is alien to Arab same-gender sexual traditions - is so extreme that he refuses to support a call for universal freedom of sexual identity." [...] Al-Shawaf argues that, [...] "In postulating the inevitability of (heterosexual) Arab violence wherever there is gay and lesbian assertiveness, Massad pre-emptively exonerates the perpetrators - whether individuals or the state - of any wrongdoing. However regrettable their behaviour, those Arabs who react violently to the gay rights campaign are not perceived by Massad as responsible for their actions, but as caught up in a broader struggle against ‘imperialism’, to which the gay rights movement is wedded." ...|$|R
