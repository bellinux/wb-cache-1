500|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, Wackett {{contributed to}} [...] "PlanD", the {{blueprint}} for restructuring the RAAF sponsored by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones. A major facet of PlanD, adopted in June 1947, was its encouragement of local industry to design and build military trainers and produce more sophisticated combat aircraft under licence from overseas manufacturers. This policy eventually led to the CAC Winjeel basic trainer and Australian co-partnership in production of the CAC Sabre jet fighter and GAF Canberra jet bomber. Wackett also supported Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt, the Air Member for Personnel, in fostering apprenticeships as part of the [...] "education revolution" [...] {{that took place in the}} RAAF during the late 1940s and early 1950s. The <b>Apprentice</b> <b>Training</b> Scheme, designed to raise the standard of technical roles in the Air Force, opened early in 1948 at the Ground Training School in RAAF Station Wagga, New South Wales, to provide education and technical training for youths aged fifteen to seventeen. By 1952, it had been renamed the RAAF School of Technical Training.|$|E

40|$|A study {{examined}} {{whether there were}} any differences {{in the performance of}} <b>apprentices</b> <b>trained</b> in off-the-job, on-the-job, or in-plant training programs. A 1984 apprentice intake sample of over 500 apprentices and information supplied by 16 in-plant training centers and 9 colleges were used to collect data on the job performance of apprentices in the following trades: fitting and machining, electrical, sheet metal, and motor mechanics. Because of problems with program variations and training pattern inconsistencies, no effective measure could be devised to compare the performance of electrical occupations and motor mechanics apprentices placed in different types of training programs.

30|$|In consequence, we {{confirm the}} {{relationships}} among the variables as formulated in our four hypotheses: First, the lower a firm’s overage costs, the higher is c.p. its investment in an inventory of skilled workers, i.e., the more <b>apprentices</b> it <b>trains.</b> Second, the lower a firm’s underage costs, the lower is c.p. its investment in an inventory of skilled workers, i.e., the less <b>apprentices</b> it <b>trains.</b> Third, given an identical cost structure, the higher a firm’s expected future demand for skilled workers, the higher is its investment in an inventory of skilled workers, i.e., the more <b>apprentices</b> it <b>trains.</b> And fourth, the relation between a high expected demand and the investment in an inventory of skilled workers is even larger for a high critical ratio, i.e., for high underage costs compared to overage costs.|$|R

50|$|Independent {{teachers}} {{could also be}} hired by the commune, but for lower wages. Most times, free-lance masters were contracted {{by a group of}} parents in a similar fashion to that of communal agreements, thus establishing their own school if the number of students being tutored was significant in size. Abbaco <b>apprentices</b> <b>training</b> to become masters could also tutor household children and pay for their studies simultaneously. Upon graduation, however, apprentices were required to teach elsewhere for fear of stealing the master’s students and income.|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{the labor}} market {{environment}} shows a strong association with a firm’s willingness to <b>train</b> <b>apprentices.</b> The probability to <b>train</b> <b>apprentices</b> is almost twice as high for small firms (both internationalized and domestic) that have difficulties to find suitable skilled workers on the external labor market.|$|R

30|$|Schweri et al. (2003) {{conducted}} the first detailed and representative Swiss survey (comparable to the German survey) in 2000. Contrary {{to the situation}} in Germany at the time, Swiss firms on average generated a net benefit (negative net costs) from <b>training</b> <b>apprentices.</b> This finding was confirmed by two subsequent surveys in 2004 and 2009 (Muehlemann et al. 2007 a; Strupler and Wolter 2012, respectively). 6 More than 60 % of all firms find offering apprenticeships profitable, meaning that the average firm does not need to recoup training expenses after the end of an apprenticeship. The relatively high mobility of Swiss <b>apprentices</b> after <b>training</b> is consistent with this observation: the surveys reveal that more than 60 % of all <b>apprentices</b> leave the <b>training</b> firm within the first year.|$|R
