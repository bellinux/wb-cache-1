5|$|By 1907 President Theodore Roosevelt {{more than}} doubled the forest reserve acreage, and Congress responded by {{limiting}} the President’s ability to proclaim new reserves. The National Forest System underwent a major reorganization in 1908, and in 1911 Congress authorized new <b>additions</b> <b>to</b> the system {{under the authority of}} the Weeks Act.

40|$|The barriers, enthalpies, {{and rate}} {{constants}} for {{the addition of}} methyl radical to the double bonds of a selection of alkene, carbonyl, and thiocarbonyl species (CH 2 =Z, CH 3 CH=Z, and (CH 3) 2 C=Z, where Z = CH 2, O, or S) and for the reverse β-scission reactions have been investigated using high-level ab inito calculations. The results are rationalized {{with the aid of}} the curve-crossing model. The addition reactions proceed via early transition structures in all cases. The barriers for addition of methyl radical to C=C bonds are largely determined by the reaction exothermicities. <b>Addition</b> <b>to</b> the unsubstituted carbon center of C=C double bonds is favored over <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> the substituted carbon center, both kinetically (lower barriers) and thermodynamically (greater exothermicities). The barriers for <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> C=O bonds are influenced by both the reaction exothermicity and the singlet-triplet gap of the substrate. <b>Addition</b> <b>to</b> the carbon center is favored over <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> the oxygen, also both thermodynamically and kinetically. For the thiocarbonyl systems, <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> the carbon center is thermodynamically favored over <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> sulfur. However, in this case, the reaction is contrathermodynamic, <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> the sulfur center having a lower barrier due to spin density considerations. Entropic differences among corresponding addition and β-scission reactions are relatively minor, and the differences in reaction rates are thus dominated by differences in the respective reaction barriers...|$|R
