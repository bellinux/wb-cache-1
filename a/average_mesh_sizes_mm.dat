40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on the {{physicochemical}} characterization of hydrogels recently obtained by crosslinking poly (vinylalcohol), PVA, with telechelic PVA (telPVA, bearing terminal aldehydic groups) via acetalization in aqueous solution. These gels were studied by equilibrium swelling, compression modulus measurements, and proton relaxometry experiments. Swelling and compression modulus data allow to estimate the average molecular weight of PVA chain between crosslinks, the <b>average</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> of the networks, and the polymer–solvent interaction parameter χ 1. The <b>average</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> of PVA-telPVA compares well with domain dimensions of diffusionally confined water as detected by NMR relaxometry. Proton relaxometry also showed different network domains in which water is compartmentalized, indicating a complex heterogeneity.

40|$|The {{structure}} of calcium-saturated alginate hydrogels {{has been studied}} by combining rheological determinations and relaxometry measurements. The mechanical spectroscopy analyses performed on alginate gel cylinders at different polysaccharide concentration allowed estimating their main structural features such as the <b>average</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>size.</b> The calculation {{was based on the}} introduction of a front factor in the classical rubber elasticity approach which was correlated to the average length of the Guluronic acid blocks along the polysaccharide chain. Transverse relaxation time (T 2) determinations performed on the cylinders revealed the presence of two relaxation rates of the water entrapped within the hydrogel network. The cross-correlation of the latter data with the rheological measurements allowed estimating the <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> distribution of the hydrogel network. The results obtained for the hydrogel cylinders were found to be consistent with the relaxometric analysis performed on the alginate microbeads where, however, only one type of water bound into the network structure was detected.

30|$|It is {{well known}} that {{permeability}} as well as mechanical properties of radically cross-linked PEG hydrogels depend not only on the size of PEG-DA polymers, but also on the polymer concentration in the reaction mixture [26, 27]. Well defined fluorescent molecules employed in partition ratio analysis are ideally suited to determine the long time permeability properties of hydrogels. Including FRAP measurements enables an estimation of the amount of immobile fractions and short time scale behavior of the solutes. Where the <b>average</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> estimated from the swelling ratio and elastic moduli of the hydrogel correspond very well to values reported in the literature for PEG membranes [15] and our values estimated by partition ratio analysis. These <b>average</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> define the overall structure of the hydrogel. On the other hand, the distribution of <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> and especially the maximal <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> within the gel caused for example by network defects [27] enhances the ability of large molecules and proteins to diffuse through the hydrogel, another important feature for biological applications. Here, our partition ratio analysis indicates a broad <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> distribution with maximal values up to four times the average. Independet of the distribution of <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes,</b> the large enhancement factor indicates an increased and unexpected capacity for the reversible uptake of hydrophilic molecules by PEG hydrogels. In combination with their high biocompatibility this explains the good suitability of PEG hydrogels in drug delivery applications. This work also nicely demonstrates the impact of slight changes in the fabrication protocol and the necessity to determine the diffusion characteristics of each set of hydrogels individually.|$|R

40|$|Colloidal gel {{networks}} are disordered elastic solids that can form even in extremely dilute particle suspensions. With interaction strengths {{comparable to the}} thermal energy, their stress-bearing network can locally restructure via breaking and reforming interparticle bonds. This allows for yielding, self-healing, and adaptive mechanics under deformation. Designing such features requires controlling stress transmission through the complex structure of the gel and this is challenging because the link between local restructuring and overall response of the network is still missing. Here, we use a space resolved analysis of dynamical processes and numerical simulations of a model gel to gain insight into this link. We show that consequences of local bond breaking propagate along the gel network over distances larger than the <b>average</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>size.</b> This provides the missing microscopic explanation for why nonlocal constitutive relations are necessary to rationalize the nontrivial mechanical response of colloidal gels.

Using live endothelial cells, we visualized cortical actin dynamics simultaneously by AFM and confocal fluorescence microscopy. We present a method that quantifies dynamic changes in the mechanical ultrastructure of the cortical actin web. We argue that the commonly used, so-called error signal imaging in AFM allows a qualitative, but not quantitative, analysis of cortical actin dynamics. The approach we used comprises fast force-curve-based topography imaging and subsequent image processing that enhances local height differences. Dynamic changes in the organization of the cytoskeleton network can be observed and quantified by surface roughness calculations and automated morphometrics. Upon treatment with low concentrations of the actin-destabilizing agent cytochalasin D, the cortical cytoskeleton network is thinned out and the <b>average</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> increases.

40|$|We report {{here the}} {{synthesis}} of {{a new class of}} hydrogels with an extremely wide range of mechanical properties suitable for cell studies. Mechanobiology has emerged as an important field in bioengineering, in part due to the development of synthetic polymer gels and fibrous protein biomaterials to control and quantify how cells sense and respond to mechanical forces in their microenvironment. To address the problem of limited availability of biomaterials, in terms of both mechanical range and optical clarity, we have prepared hydrogels that combine poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and phosphorylcholine (PC) zwitterions. Our goal was to create a hydrogel platform that exceeds the range of Young’s moduli reported for similar hydrogels, while being simple to synthesize and manipulate. The Young’s modulus of these “PEG-PC” hydrogels can be tuned over 4 orders of magnitude, much greater than commonly used hydrogels such as PEG-diacrylate, PEG-dimethacrylate, and polyacrylamide, with smaller <b>average</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> and optical clarity. We prepared PEG-PC hydrogels to study how substrate mechanical properties influence cell morphology, focal adhesion structure, and proliferation across multiple mammalian cell lines, as a proof of concept. These novel PEG-PC biomaterials represent a new and useful class of mechanically tunable hydrogels for mechanobiology...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{structure}} of the membrane skeleton on the cytoplasmic surface of the erythrocyte plasma membrane was observed in dried human erythrocyte ghosts by atomic force microscopy (AFM), taking advantage of its high sensitivity to small height variations in surfaces. The majority of the membrane skeleton can be imaged, even on the extracellular surface of the membrane. Various fixation and drying methods were examined for preparation of ghost membrane samples for AFM observation, and {{it was found that}} freeze-drying (freezing by rapid immersion in a cryogen) of unfixed specimens was a fast and simple way to obtain consistently good results for observation without removing the membrane or extending the membrane skeleton. Observation of the membrane skeleton at the external surface of the cell was possible mainly because the bilayer portion of the membrane sank into the cell during the drying process. The <b>average</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> of the spectrin network observed at the extracellular and cytoplasmic surfaces of the plasma membrane was 4800 and 3000 nm 2, respectively, which indicates that spectrin forms a three-dimensionally folded meshwork, and that 80 % of spectrin can be observed at the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane...|$|R
