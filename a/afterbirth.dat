5|$|The gestational period {{lasts for}} about {{eight and a}} half months, after which a single calf is born. Females in labour do not move away from the female herd and {{repeatedly}} lie down and get up again. Births normally take place in areas with short grass when the cow is in the lying position. She stands up immediately afterwards which causes the umbilical cord to break, vigorously licks the calf and chews on the <b>afterbirth.</b> In spite of regional variations, around 80% of the females give birth to their calves within a period of two to three weeks after the onset of the rainy season - from mid-November to the end of December. Seasonal breeding has also been reported among wildebeest in captivity in European zoos. Twin births have not been reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} open woodland and transitional zones. It has adapted well to urban environments {{and is a}} common city bird in Sydney, Canberra and Perth. An omnivorous and opportunistic feeder, it eats {{a wide variety of}} plant and animal material, as well as food waste from urban areas. In eastern Australia its range is strongly correlated with the presence of sheep, and it has been blamed for killing lambs. However, this is very rare, and the raven most often scavenges for <b>afterbirth</b> and stillborn animals as well as newborn lamb faeces. The Australian raven is territorial, with pairs generally bonding for life. Breeding takes place between July and September, with almost no variation across its range. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure of sticks sited high in a tree, or occasionally in a man-made structure such as a windmill or other building.|$|E
5|$|Australian ravens die {{most often}} by being shot or poisoned—generally by farmers. Despite their fondness for roadkill, fewer ravens are hit by {{vehicles}} than Australian magpies. Research in the 1950s and 60s showed that 64% of Australian ravens perished {{in their first}} year of life. Immature birds are most at risk of dying as {{they are more likely to}} come into conflict with farmers. The Australian Raven is a peaceful bird, showing no aggression toward humans or other birds without reason. However, the Australian raven is frequently blamed for the loss of young lambs. Scientific observation in the country's southeast showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked. Australian ravens mostly eat faeces (often from the lamb's anus), <b>afterbirth</b> or stillborn lambs. Newborn lamb faeces is nutritious, containing around 21–44% protein, 9–37% fat and 10–30% carbohydrate. It has the consistency of treacle and often sticks to the lamb's hindquarters or tail. The raven bites a sleeping lamb's tail, holding on and walking behind it when it wakes up. A healthy lamb would respond by running away or butting the bird, but a sick one might not respond and be attacked further as it alerts the bird that it is vulnerable. Wounded lambs can also succumb to Clostridium infection as these bacteria are present on raven bills. Ravens bring some benefits to agricultural areas as they clean away carrion and eat insects that are potentially damaging to crops. In areas of Western Australia, the species is classified as a Declared Pest of Agriculture under the provisions of the Agriculture and Related Resources Protection Act 1976, meaning that shooting on private land in rural areas is legal, although should be considered only after other options have been exhausted.|$|E

Association analyses {{in the present study were}} carried out using multiple logistic regression models. Herds where cattle were purchased or introduced had a greater likelihood of being positive to leptospira interrogans serovar hardjo (P< 0. 01) and Salmonella (P< 0. 01).

Herds that practiced year round calving were more likely to be positive to Neospora caninum (P< 0. 05) compared to herds with a spring-calving season, with no difference in risk between herds that practiced split calving compared to herds that practiced spring calving. No association was found between presence of dogs on farms and prevalence of Neospora caninum possibly due to limited access of dogs to infected materials including <b>afterbirths.</b> The information from this study will assist in the design of suitable control programmes for the diseases under investigation in pasture-based livestock systems. peer-reviewe...|$|R
5|$|Mammalian prey {{includes}} rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, raccoons (Procyon lotor), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), beavers (Castor canadensis), {{and deer}} fawns. Newborn, dead, sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted. However, more formidable prey such as adult raccoons and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked. In the Chesapeake Bay area, bald eagles are reportedly the main natural predators of raccoons. Where available, seal colonies can provide much food. On Protection Island, Washington, they commonly feed on harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) <b>afterbirths,</b> still-borns and sickly seal pups. On San Juan Island in Washington, introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), mainly those killed by auto accidents, comprise nearly 60% of the dietary intake of eagles.

25|$|In West Africa, the African wolf mostly {{confines}} {{itself to}} small prey, such as hares, rats, ground squirrels and cane rats. Other prey items include lizards, snakes, and ground-nesting birds, such as francolins and bustards. It also consumes {{a large amount}} of insects, including dung beetles, larvae, termites and grasshoppers. It will also kill young gazelles, duikers and warthogs. In East Africa, it consumes invertebrates and fruit, though 60% of its diet consists of rodents, lizards, snakes, birds, hares and Thomson's gazelles. During the wildebeest calving season, African wolves will feed almost exclusively on their <b>afterbirth.</b> In the Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater, less than 20% of its diet comes from scavenging. In Senegal, where both C. a. anthus and C. a. lupaster coexist, some degree of niche segregation is apparent in their choice of prey; the former is reputed to feed primarily on lambs, whereas the latter attacks larger prey, such as sheep, goats and cattle.|$|E
25|$|Grant’s gazelles {{sexually mature}} at 18 months. Territory-holding bucks mate more than ones in {{bachelor}} groups. The courting ritual {{begins with a}} buck following a doe, {{waiting for her to}} urinate. When she does, the male does the Flehmen response to determine if she is in estrus. If she is, he will continue to follow her. The female will lift her tail, signaling she is ready to mate, and the male will mount her. The gestation period for the gazelle lasts for 198 days. Births peak in January and February. A doe will leave her herd and find a well-hidden place to give birth. Afterwards, the female eats the <b>afterbirth</b> and other fluids to keep the fawn clean and scentless. Females that have recently given birth will stay together for protection. The does nurse their fawns four times a day. Fawns are immobile for the first few days, so the mother stays close by. When the fawn can walk, it leaves with its mother to find a herd. Around this time, fawns will associate with one another in peer groups. A gazelle is weaned at six months, but will continue to associate with its mother until adolescence.|$|E
40|$|Scrapie is a fatal, {{neurological}} disease of {{sheep and goats}} and belongs to the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. In 1998, {{a new type of}} scrapie, designated scrapie Nor 98, was detected in Norway. Scrapie Nor 98 differs from classical scrapie in the distribution of pathological changes and of the scrapie prion protein, the Western blot profile of the prion protein, and with isolated cases usually being observed in the case flocks. In 2004, a case–control study was conducted on scrapie Nor 98 with 28 cases and 102 randomly selected controls. The questionnaire included questions on demographic data, animal contact between sheep flocks, indirect contact with equipment, use of concentrate feed and supplemental feeds, and use of medicines and vaccines. The data were analysed by using logistic regression with the sheep flock as the statistical unit. In the final model, the detection of scrapie Nor 98 was related to the practice of not removing all <b>afterbirths,</b> the use of vitamin and mineral feed supplements, the absence of concentrate feed of swine or poultry on the farm and the presence of dogs on the farm. The results show that the epidemiology of scrapie Nor 98 differs from that of classical scrapie in that no risk factors that indicate transmission of scrapie Nor 98 between flocks by movement or direct contact between animals were found. Furthermore, the association between scrapie Nor 98 and mineral intake shown herein should be explored further. Although the possibility that scrapie Nor 98 has a low transmissibility between animals under natural conditions cannot be ruled out, the results would also be in accordance with a spontaneous aetiology...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} sanitary-hygienic {{characteristics}} of working conditions, charts with results of sanitary-epidemiologic examination {{performed in a}} zoogenous nidus, outpatient clinic cards and questionnaires filled in by 202 patients living in Omsk region and suffering from occupational brucellosis. The disease usually prevails among stock-breeders, veterinaries and workers employed at meat-processing enterprises. Our goal was to detect risks of occupational, production-induced and general pathology evolvement. Working conditions which all the examined people had to work in corresponded to hazardous (3. 3) or even dangerous (4) category as per occurrence of contacts with infectious agents and parasites (biological risk). Apart from biological factor, a number of workers were under complex exposure to ammonia concentrations (higher than MPC), noise higher than MPL, vibration, cooling microclimate, uncomfortable lighting environment, labor process hardness and intensity. There were several factors causing epidemiologic risks as well. Disinfectants were absent or their quantity was not sufficient; industrial and amenity rooms were not well-organized; there was no central hot water supply or shower rooms, separate rooms for meals, specialized implements for removing abortus and stillborn fetuses and <b>afterbirths,</b> correctly organized burial grounds, or first aid kits. Hygienic health risks were caused by insufficient cleaning agents supply, absence of centralized protecting clothing laundering, and insufficient provision with personal protection means. Occupational health risks resulted from absence of preliminary medical examinations in standard recruitment procedures, irregularity and low quality of periodical medical examinations.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{exposes the}} zoonotic Coxiella burnetii and its distribution in sheep and cattle herds in Germany. The {{importance of this}} zoonosis {{in terms of the}} potential hazard to public health, the need for preventive measures and control strategies and the problem of diagnosis of an intracellular bacterium of risk group 3 "Z" will be discussed. In this study investigations were carried out in clinically healthy non-vaccinated cattle herds and sheep flocks and in herds with increased abortion rate or clinical symptoms. Furthermore, retrospectively conducted epidemiological surveys are discussed by two Q fever outbreaks. In clinically healthy cattle herds, seroprevalence up to 9 %, and monthly average up to 24. 7 % were detected. 1640 sera were examined for this purpose. The results of investigations in 40 clinically healthy unvaccinated sheep flocks led to a prevalence at herd level of 5 % and a seroprevalence of 25 %. In the <b>afterbirths</b> tested in 2009 C. burnetii DNA was detected in 75 %. Nine isolates of the same phylogenetic group could be isolated. In this case the evaluations were based on a sample size of 1158 serum samples, 440 vaginal swabs, 440 rectal swabs, 71 <b>afterbirths</b> and 6 fetuses. The detection of C. burnetii and antibodies in clinically healthy cattle herds was performed using milk samples. This medium has the advantage of being able to carry out direct and indirect diagnostic methods from the same sample. The results of bulk milk samples showed evidence of C. burnetii genome up to 62. 5 % and antibody detection up to 68. 3 %. In the individual milk samples, we found the highest DNA evidence at 60. 0 % and the highest antibody detection at 62. 2 %. A total of 2980 tank and individual milk samples were examined. In the context of the epidemiological surveys of the described Q fever outbreaks, a prevalence of 16. 7 % and a seroprevalence 76. 2 % were determined. A constant course of C. burnetii and evidence of antibody detection cannot be determined in both species. It presents a continuous dynamic in the course of infection which varies from year to year and sometimes even month to month. It is clear that one-time studies represent only snapshots. The inconsistency of excretion and seroconversion are a constant challenge in the interpretation of the infection with C. burnetii. Long-term studies are required for the quality of the diagnostic statements and the assessment of the current risk potential of Q fever and coxiellosis. In addition to the difficulty of interpretation of diagnostic data, it is difficult to compare records of different studies. The described deviations of results in standardized, commercially available test systems illustrate this problem. In the international published literature on Q fever, there is wide variation in study design and implementation of the study conduct. Direct comparisons are therefore partly impossible. For the treatment and prophylaxis of coxiellosis, the importance of vaccination of cattle and sheep flocks increases. Through the demonstrated reduction of excretion and the abortion rate, it represents a good way to control C. burnetii infections and to prevent human disease. Still unclear is the large discrepancy between reporting higher numbers of cattle and much more frequent outbreaks in sheep. In addition to the genetic variability of C. burnetii genome, which can only be assessed by genome sequencing, the type of livestock of both species is important. The Q fever outbreak in the Netherlands shows that not only the species goat, but also the extensive farming is relevant. The transmission of airborne transmissible agents is increased by high animal stocking densities in herds and areas. There is a high number of unreported cases of human Q fever infections due to unspecific clinical symptoms. The same applies to cattle and sheep stocks. In the stocks, an infection may remain unnoticed for a long time, so the initial entry of the pathogen often can only be traced back by analysing human disease cases. C. burnetii is not a bacterium that causes large epidemics and high mortality in Germany. Therefore, the relevance of the pathogen and priority of epidemiological surveys and diagnostic measures often lead to discussions. Most Q fever outbreaks are limited in the number of patients. This is partially caused by underestimation of the hazard of this pathogen. Only by performing long-term studies of herds and flocks, specific risks can be assessed and when necessary appropriate control measures can be applied...|$|R

5000|$|Along some {{portions}} of the North Pacific coastline, bald eagles which had historically preyed mainly kelp-dwelling fish and supplementally sea otter (Enhydra lutris) pups are now preying mainly on seabird colonies since both the fish (possibly due to overfishing) and otters (cause unknown) have had precipitous population declines, causing concern for seabird conservation. Because of this more extensive predation, some biologist have expressed concern that murres are heading for a [...] "conservation collision" [...] due to heavy eagle predation. Eagles have been confirmed to attack nocturnally active, burrow-nesting seabird species such as storm petrels and shearwaters by digging out their burrows and feeding on all animals they find inside. If a bald eagle flies close by, waterbirds will often fly away en masse, though in other cases they may seemingly ignore a perched eagle. If the said birds are on a colony, this exposed their unprotected eggs and nestlings to scavengers such as gulls. Bird prey may occasionally be attacked in flight, with prey up {{to the size of}} Canada geese attacked and killed in mid-air. Unprecedented photographs of a bald eagle unsuccessfully attempting to prey on a much larger adult trumpeter swan (Cygnus buccinator) in mid-flight were taken recently. While adults often actively prey on waterbirds, congregated wintering waterfowl are frequently exploited for carcasses to scavenge by immature eagles in harsh winter weather. Bald eagles have been recorded as killing other raptors on occasion. In some cases, these may be attacks of competition or kleptoparasitism on rival species but ended with the consumption of the victim. Raptorial birds reported to be hunted by these eagles have included large adults of species such as red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) and black (Coragyps atratus) and turkey vultures (Cathartes aura).Mammalian prey includes rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, raccoons (Procyon lotor), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), beavers (Castor canadensis), and deer fawns. Newborn, dead, sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted. However, more formidable prey such as adult raccoons and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked.

60|$|As I remarked in {{a former}} Lecture on a {{different}} subject (for subjects the most diverse in literature have still their tangents), the Gothic character, and its good and evil fruits, appeared less in Italy {{than in any other}} part of European Christendom. There was accordingly much less romance, as that word is commonly understood; or, perhaps, more truly stated, there was romance instead of chivalry. In Italy, an earlier imitation of, and a more evident and intentional blending with, the Latin literature took place than elsewhere. The operation of the feudal system, too, was incalculably weaker, of that singular chain of independent interdependents, the principle of which was a confederacy for the preservation of individual, consistently with general, freedom. In short, Italy, in the time of Dante, was an <b>afterbirth</b> of eldest Greece, a renewal or a reflex of the old Italy under its kings and first Roman consuls, a net-work of free little republics, with the same domestic feuds, civil wars, and party spirit,--the same vices and virtues produced on a similarly narrow theatre,--the existing state of things being, as in all small democracies, under the working and direction of certain individuals, to whose will even the laws were swayed;--whilst {{at the same time the}} singular spectacle was exhibited amidst all this confusion of the flourishing of commerce, and the protection and encouragement of letters and arts. Never was the commercial spirit so well reconciled to the nobler principles of social polity as in Florence. It tended there to union and permanence and elevation,--not as the overbalance of it in England is now doing, to dislocation, change and moral degradation. The intensest patriotism reigned in these communities, but confined and attached exclusively to the small locality of the patriot's birth and residence; whereas in the true Gothic feudalism, country was nothing but the preservation of personal independence. But then, on the other hand, as a counterbalance to these disuniting elements, there was in Dante's Italy, as in Greece, a much greater uniformity of religion common to all than amongst the northern nations.|$|E
60|$|The {{news was}} {{imparted}} with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial {{usage of the}} Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born, When he had betaken himself to the women's apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the <b>afterbirth</b> {{in the presence of}} the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain. The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king's bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac foetus in foetu and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers Sturzgeburt, the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents--in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations. The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation. The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro's inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a prima facie and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human. An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses. The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man. Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.|$|E

It was released on October 30, 2015 for Windows, OS X, and Linux computers. The expansion was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions on May 10, 2016. The expansion {{is unlikely to be}} released on any other platforms due to limitations of these platforms' hardware capabilities and the more complex mechanics required by <b>Afterbirth.</b>|$|E
