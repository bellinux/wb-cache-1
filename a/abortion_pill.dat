Previously, {{the penalty for}} receiving an abortion was up to seven years in prison, with 10-15 years for the person performing the abortion. In 2014, Brunei's government implemented Sharia criminal law {{in a series of}} phases which was set to increase the punishment for abortion to execution by stoning. This part of the law was to come into effect in 2016, although it's now expected to come into effect in 2018.

2500|$|... adj. Capable of {{preventing}} gestation, either by preventing implantation or by causing the uterine lining to shed after implantation. —n. A contragestive drug or agent.Also contragestant, <b>abortion</b> <b>pill.</b> A substance called mifepristone, or RU-486, which {{was developed by}} Dr. Etienne Baulieu and the Roussel-Uclaf company. The contragestive blocks progesterone receptors in the endometrium (uterine lining), preventing its buildup by progesterone; hence the uterus cannot sustain a pregnancy. It does not prevent fertilization or implantation, so technically it is an ABORTIFACIENT rather than a contraceptive. Baulieu's definition of a 'contragestive' included any birth control method that could possibly act after fertilization and before nine-weeks gestational age.|$|E

A prospective market survey study involving retailers, wholesalers and doctors (M. D. -Gynec) were selected in Rajkot city located in different areas. They were explained about the objective of the study and given a validated questionnaire. The questionnaire included the questions regarding most commonly used allopathic and ayurvedic abortifacients (<b>abortion</b> <b>pills),</b> % sale of allopathic verses ayurvedic drugs, % sale of drugs on prescription, degree of doctors prescribe the abortion medicines, age factor of patients, sale data in respect of month, most commonly side effects seen in patients due to usage of self medicated <b>abortion</b> <b>pills,</b> number of self medicated patients comes for treatment per month etc. This study highlights commonly used self medicated abortifacient drugs in the patient with marital status and age which gives many types of serious side effects. As per doctors opinion that ayurvedic <b>abortion</b> <b>pills</b> are not effective in the process of abortion. While in market survey ayurvedic <b>abortion</b> <b>pills</b> are more used than the allopathic <b>abortion</b> <b>pills</b> by patients. Hence detailed and scientifically designed research on ayurvedic abortifacients for its effectiveness in the abortion process and to discover the seriousness of side effects occurred on the usage of self medicated abortifacients by general public to save the public health is highly required...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEvidence {{suggests}} that there is widespread home use of <b>abortion</b> <b>pills</b> in Ireland and that ending a pregnancy in this way is potentially safer than the alternatives available to many women. This paper argues that there is a strong case for women with unwanted pregnancies to be offered truthful and objective information regarding the use of <b>abortion</b> <b>pills</b> by trusted local professionals and, further, that this is possible within existing law. A move in this direction would not, however, negate the need for legal reform to address the fundamental moral incoherence of a law that treats women who terminate pregnancies within Ireland as criminals but those who travel to access services overseas as victims in need of support. In support of these arguments, the paper draws on both library research and a small number of interviews with government officials, service providers and activists...|$|R

40|$|The uneasy {{legal and}} {{political}} settlement regarding abortion in Northern Ireland has long relied on the outsourcing of aspects of reproductive health care. While local health services offer only highly restricted access to termination procedures, women travel to access abortion services elsewhere. However, technological changes, in particular the development of abortifacient medicines, are revolutionising this aspect of reproductive healthcare. Rather than women having to travel to a service, today that service can travel to women through the postal supply of <b>abortion</b> <b>pills,</b> sourced via the internet. While online supply of pharmaceuticals can pose potential public health risks, at least two groups offer safe and effective telemedical services to women in Northern Ireland. Women on Web and Women Help Women each supply <b>abortion</b> <b>pills,</b> under prescription from a doctor based in another country, to women who wish to end a pregnancy of nine weeks or less. Here, we consider {{the extent to which}} the telemedical abortion services that they offer are protected by transnational law, in particular, EU provisions on cross-border services. This offers new and hitherto unexplored lines of legal argument (including defences against criminal prosecution and challenges to a state’s attempts to restrict the flow of services). Through claiming the autonomy-based legal relationships implicit in transnational law and the power that flows therefrom, we suggest, women may challenge regulatory arrangements which seek to limit their reproductive rights...|$|R
