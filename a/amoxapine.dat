25|$|There are {{two major}} groups of TCAs in terms of {{chemical}} structure, which most, but not all, TCAs fall into. The groupings {{are based on the}} tricyclic ring system. They are the dibenzazepines (imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, lofepramine) and the dibenzocycloheptadienes (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, butriptyline). Minor TCA groups based on ring system include the dibenzoxepins (doxepin), the dibenzothiepines (dosulepin), and the dibenzoxazepines (<b>amoxapine).</b> In addition to classification based on the ring system, TCAs can also be usefully grouped {{based on the number of}} substitutions of the side chain amine. These groups include the tertiary amines (imipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, amitriptyline, butriptyline, doxepin, dosulepin) and the secondary amines (desipramine, nortriptyline, protriptyline). Lofepramine is technically a tertiary amine, but acts largely as a prodrug of desipramine, a secondary amine, and hence is more similar in profile to the secondary amines than to the tertiary amines. <b>Amoxapine</b> does not have the TCA side chain and hence is neither a tertiary nor secondary amine, although it is often grouped with the secondary amines due to sharing more in common with them.|$|E

Also, desipramine, dothiepin, phenelzine, tetrabenazine, and reserpine have been known to trigger NMS.

50|$|<b>Amoxapine</b> {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of major depressive disorder. Compared to other antidepressants it is believed to have a faster onset of action, with therapeutic effects seen within four to seven days. In excess of 80% of patients that do respond to <b>amoxapine</b> are reported to respond within a fortnight of the beginning of treatment. It also has properties {{similar to those of the}} atypical antipsychotics, and may behave as one and may be used in {{the treatment}} of schizophrenia off-label.

50|$|<b>Amoxapine</b> {{possesses}} {{a wide array}} of pharmacological effects. It is a moderate and strong reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, respectively, and binds to the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, 5-HT7, D2, α1-adrenergic, D3, D4, and H1 receptors with varying but significant affinity, where it acts as an antagonist (or inverse agonist depending on the receptor in question) at all sites. It has weak but negligible affinity for the dopamine transporter and the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, D1, α2-adrenergic, H4, mACh, and GABAA receptors, and no affinity for the β-adrenergic receptors or the allosteric benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor. <b>Amoxapine</b> is also a weak GlyT2 blocker, as well as a weak (Ki = 2.5 μM, EC50 = 0.98 μM) δ-opioid receptor partial agonist.|$|E

50|$|Maprotiline was {{developed}} by Ciba (now operated by Novartis). It was patented in 1966 and was first described in the literature in 1969. The drug was introduced for medical use in 1974.

It was introduced after {{most of the other}} TCAs but was the first TeCA to be developed and marketed, with the TeCAs mianserin and <b>amoxapine</b> following shortly thereafter and mirtazapine being introduced later on.|$|E

50|$|Fluotracen (SKF-28,175) is a {{tricyclic}} drug which possesses dual antidepressant and antipsychotic activity. This {{profile of}} effects {{is similar to}} that of related agents like <b>amoxapine,</b> loxapine, and trimipramine which may also be used in the treatment of both depression and psychosis. It was believed that such duality would be advantageous in the treatment of schizophrenia, as depression is often comorbid with the disorder and usual antipsychotics often worsen such symptoms. In any case, however, fluotracen was never marketed.|$|E
5000|$|Butriptyline, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Evadyne among others, is a {{tricyclic}} antidepressant (TCA) {{that has been used}} in the United Kingdom and several other European countries for the treatment of depression but appears to no longer be marketed. Along with trimipramine, iprindole, and <b>amoxapine,</b> it has been described as an [...] "atypical" [...] or [...] "second-generation" [...] TCA due to its relatively late introduction and atypical pharmacology. It was very little-used compared to other TCAs, with the number of prescriptions dispensed only in the thousands.|$|E
50|$|TeCAs have diverse {{pharmacology}} and {{differ from}} TCAs {{in a number}} of ways. With the exception of <b>amoxapine,</b> TeCAs do not inhibit the reuptake of serotonin. However, aside from mirtazapine, they do inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine. TeCAs block the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors similarly to TCAs. Besides mirtazapine, they also block the α1-adrenergic receptor. Conversely, whereas TCAs have relatively low affinity for the α2-adrenergic receptor, mianserin and mirtazapine potently antagonize this receptor, and this action is thought to be involved in their antidepressant effects. TeCAs block the histamine H1 receptor similarly to the TCAs, but tend to be even stronger antihistamines than TCAs. On the other hand, in contrast to almost all TCAs, TeCAs have only low affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and for this reason, are associated with few or no anticholinergic side effects. Mianserin and mirtazapine are far less toxic than TCAs in overdose.|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{antidepressant}} medications act {{to raise}} noradrenaline, such as serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs or NERIs) and the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). The {{mechanism by which}} these medications work is that the reuptake inhibitors prevent the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine by the presynaptic neuron, paralyzing the normal function of the NET. At the same time, higher levels of 5-HT are maintained in the synapse increasing the concentrations of the latter neurotransmitters. Since the noradrenaline transporter is {{responsible for most of}} the dopamine clearance in the prefrontal cortex, SNRIs block reuptake of dopamine too, accumulating the dopamine in the synapse. However, DAT, the primary way dopamine is transported out of the cell, can work to decrease dopamine concentration in the synapse when the NET is blocked. For many years, the number one choice in treating mood disorders like depression was through administration of TCAs, such as desipramine (Norpramin), nortriptyline (Arentyl, Pamelor), protriptyline (Vivactil) and <b>amoxapine</b> (Asendin). [...] SSRIs, which mainly regulate serotonin, subsequently replaced tricyclics as the primary treatment option for depression because of their better tolerability and lower incidence of adverse effects.|$|E
40|$|Ion {{channels}} {{are known to}} be modulated by antidepressant drugs, but the molecular mechanisms are not known. We have shown that the antidepressant drug <b>amoxapine</b> suppresses rectifier outward K (IK) currents in mouse cortical neurons.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>amoxapine</b> (10 (- 7) - 10 (- 4) M) {{have been studied}} in rat atrial fibres {{obtained}} from untreated animals and animals pretreated for 28 days with <b>amoxapine</b> (10 mg kg- 1, i. p.). In untreated atria <b>amoxapine</b> reduced atrial rate, contractile force and df/dtmax, prolonged the sinus node recovery time and decreased atrial excitability. <b>Amoxapine</b> also decreased amplitude and Vmax of the upstroke, prolonged {{the duration of the}} action potential (APD) and effective refractory period (ERP) and reduced the resting membrane potential. During the treatment with <b>amoxapine</b> behavioural and cardiovascular adverse effects, including hypotension, tachycardia and prolongation of the Q-Tc, were observed. However, {{with the exception of the}} ERP which was significantly prolonged in pretreated atria, pretreatment with <b>amoxapine</b> did not modify the control values of the measured parameters compared to those obtained in untreated atria. Further addition of <b>amoxapine</b> produced similar changes in both pretreated and untreated atria. However, in contrast to untreated atria, in pretreated atria the prolongation of the ERP produced by <b>amoxapine</b> exceeded the prolongation of the APD and thus, the ERP/APD ratio increased. The decrease in atrial excitability was also more marked in pretreated than in untreated atria. <b>Amoxapine</b> inhibited the slow action potentials and contractions induced by isoprenaline in K-depolarized atria. It is concluded that the electrophysiological effects of <b>amoxapine</b> on rat atrial fibres are similar to those described for other tricyclic antidepressants.

40|$|Abstract] The {{identification}} of a novel by-product in the tissue and fluid extracts of a victim of fatal overdoses of the tricyclic antidepressant <b>amoxapine</b> and aspirin is presented. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry suggested that <b>amoxapine</b> was transacetylated by aspirin to form N-acetylated <b>amoxapine.</b> When standard N-acetylated <b>amoxapine</b> was prepared and subjected to the same analytical testing as extracted tissues and fluids, the metabolite was identified as N-acetylamoxapine. Quantitation of N-acetylamoxapine was obtained by gas chromatography. Concentrations of N-acetylamoxapine compared to those of <b>amoxapine</b> and salicylates in blood, liver, stomach, and small bowel are given. Introduct ion Deaths resulting from drug overdose often involve the intake of multiple drugs. <b>Amoxapine</b> (Figure l B), a dibenzoxazepine antidepressant, has been implicated in overdose (l) and in deaths stemming from Overdose (2) since its introduction in 1980.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} <b>amoxapine</b> on {{membrane}} potentials and membrane currents of rabbit sinoatrial node were studied using the double microelectrode voltage clamp method. <b>Amoxapine</b> (> 1 pmol*litre-') decreased {{the heart rate}} and the maximum rate of rise {{and the rate of}} diastolic depolarisation in a dose dependent manner. Above 3 pmol-litre-', <b>amoxapine</b> also decreased the action potential amplitude and prolonged the action potential duration at half amplitude. These electrophysiological changes induced by arnoxapine were relatively reduced in a high calcium medium (extracellular calcium concentration 4. 0 mmol. litre-'). In voltage clamp experiments <b>amoxapine</b> depressed the slow inward current, the time dependent potassium current, and the hyperpolarisation activated inward current. The major effect, however, was considered to be a reduction of the slow inward current. It is concluded that <b>amoxapine</b> produced an inhibitory action on the electrical activity of sinoatrial node, and this action is mainly explained by an inhibition of calcium influx through the cell membrane.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} <b>amoxapine</b> and vitamin B 12 for treating retrograde ejaculation (RE). Materials and Methods Between May 2009 and November 2012, this open-label, randomized, crossover study enrolled 26 men suffering with RE at Department of Reproductive Medicine, Omori Hospital. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups (n= 13 each). The amoxapine-B 12 group received <b>amoxapine</b> (50 mg daily for 4 weeks, orally) followed (after a 1 -week washout period) by vitamin B 12 (500 μg three-times daily for 4 weeks). The B 12 -amoxapine group received the opposite regimen. All patients masturbated to ejaculation at least twice during each treatment period. The primary outcome was antegrade ejaculation of semen, {{as reported by the}} patient, {{on more than one occasion}} during either treatment period (defined as treatment success). Any adverse events were noted. Success rates were compared between treatments using Fisher’s exact test. Results One patient (B 12 -amoxapine group) withdrew for personal reasons (breakdown of marital relations); all other patients completed the study. Overall success rate was 88 % (22 / 25). Success rate was higher for <b>amoxapine</b> than for vitamin B 12 (80 %, 20 / 25 vs 16 %, 4 / 25; P< 0. 0001). 18 patients were responsive to <b>amoxapine</b> but not to vitamin B 12, 2 patients were responsive to vitamin B 12 but not <b>amoxapine,</b> 2 patients were responsive to both drugs, and 3 patients had no response to either drug.

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of nine different tricyclic antidepressant drugs on the glycine uptake mediated by the glycine transporter 1 b (GLYT 1 b) and glycine transporter 2 a (GLYT 2 a) stably expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Desipramine, imipramine, clomipramine, nomifensine and mianserin had no effect on the activity of the glycine transporters. Doxepin, amitriptyline and nortriptyline inhibited the two transporter subtypes to a similar extent. <b>Amoxapine</b> displayed a selective inhibition of GLYT 2 a behaving as a 10 fold more efficient inhibitor of this isoform than of GLYT 1 b. Kinetic analysis of the initial rates of glycine uptake by GLYT 2 a as a function of either glycine, chloride or sodium concentration, in the absence and presence of <b>amoxapine</b> indicated that <b>amoxapine</b> behaved as a competitive inhibitor of both glycine and chloride and a mixed-type inhibitor with respect to sodium. A kinetic model was developed which explains adequately these data, and gives information about the order of binding of sodium and chloride ions to GLYT 2 a. Our results may {{contribute to the development of}} the glycine transporter pharmacology.

40|$|Tricyclic {{antidepressants}} (TCAs) {{have been}} reported to interact with the opioid system, but their pharmacological activity at opioid receptors has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the actions of <b>amoxapine,</b> amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine, and imipramine at distinct cloned and native opioid receptors. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing delta-opioid receptors (CHO/DOR), TCAs displaced [3 H]naltrindole binding and stimulated guanosine 5 '-O-(3 -[(35) S]thio) triphosphate ([(35) S]GTPgammaS) binding at micromolar concentrations with <b>amoxapine</b> displaying the highest potency and efficacy. <b>Amoxapine</b> and amitriptyline inhibited cyclic AMP formation and induced the phosphorylation of signaling molecules along the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2) and phosphatidylinositol- 3 kinase pathways. <b>Amoxapine</b> also activated delta-opioid receptors in rat dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens and human frontal cortex. In CHO cells expressing kappa-opioid receptors (CHO/KOR), TCAs, but not <b>amoxapine,</b> exhibited higher receptor affinity and more potent stimulation of [(35) S]GTPgammaS binding than in CHO/DOR and effectively inhibited cyclic AMP accumulation. Amitriptyline regulated ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation and activity in CHO/KOR and C 6 glioma cells endogenously expressing kappa-opioid receptors, and this effect was attenuated by the kappa-opioid antagonist nor-binaltorphimine. In rat nucleus accumbens, amitriptyline slightly inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity and counteracted the inhibitory effect of the full kappa agonist trans-(-) - 3, 4 dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2 -(1 -pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide (U 50, 488). At the cloned mu-opioid receptor, TCAs showed low affinity and no significant agonist activity. These results show that TCAs differentially regulate opioid receptors with a preferential agonist activity on either delta or kappa subtypes and suggest that this property may contribute to their therapeutic and/or side effects...|$|E
40|$|Antidepressants {{are known}} to possess {{analgesic}} properties and {{have been shown to}} interact with the opioid system by either enhancing endogenous opioid levels or displacing opioid ligands from binding sites. However, little is known on the activity of these drugs at the distinct opioid receptor subtypes. In the present study we investigated the interaction of the tricyclic antidepressants <b>amoxapine,</b> nortriptyline, amitriptyline, desipramine and imipramine and the SSRI antidepressant fluoxetine with each of the cloned human opioid receptors individually expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. We found that <b>amoxapine</b> behaved as a full δ receptor agonist in stimulating [35 S]GTPγS binding with a potency in the low micromolar range. Moreover in cells expressing the δ receptor, <b>amoxapine</b> induced a rapid phosphorylation of Thr 308 -Akt- 1, Ser 9 -glycogen synthase kinase 3 β and ERK 1 / 2. <b>Amoxapine</b> was a much weaker agonist at the κ receptor and had no activity at µ and NOP receptors. Instead, the other tricyclic antidepressants were more potent and effective agonists at κ than δ receptors, and were inactive at µ and NOP receptors. On the other hand, fluoxetine displayed agonist activity at κ but not at µ and δ receptors. Moreover, it antagonized the action of the δ agonist DPDPE. These data indicate that antidepressants can act as agonists at opioid receptors and display differential activity toward the distinct subtypes.
