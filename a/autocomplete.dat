25|$|Through {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, there was {{considerable}} experimentation with {{ways to improve the}} BBS experience from its command-line interface roots. Almost every popular system improved matters somewhat by adding ANSI-based color menus to make reading easier, and most also allowed cursor commands to offer command-line recall and similar features. Another common feature was the use of <b>autocomplete</b> to make menu navigation simpler, a feature that would not re-appear on the web until decades later.|$|E

40|$|The APIS project intents to semantically {{annotate}} the Austrian Bibliography Lexicon (ÖBL). To {{achieve this}} goal we develop(ed) this web-app. It {{is based on a}} 5 entities (person, place, institution, event, work) data model. All 5 entities are connected to each other. Entities, as well as relations between them, can be typed with vocabularies similar to the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS). APIS comes with a built in system of <b>autocompletes</b> that allows researchers to import meta-data of entities with just a single click. Out of the box APIS supports Stanbol as a backend for the <b>autocompletes,</b> but the system is rather easy to adapt to any Restfull API. APIS also supports the parsing of RDFs describing entities into an entity. The parsing is configured in a settings file. APIS comes also with a built in highlighter. The highlighter is configured via the built in admin backend and allows to annotate texts with entities and/or relations between entities...|$|R
25|$|Many {{forms of}} {{shorthand}} exist. A typical shorthand system provides symbols or abbreviations for words and common phrases, which can allow someone well-trained {{in the system}} to write as quickly as people speak. Abbreviation methods are alphabet-based and use different abbreviating approaches. Several <b>autocomplete</b> programs, standalone or integrated in text editors, based on word lists, also include a shorthand function for frequently-used phrases. Many journalists use shorthand writing to quickly take notes at press conferences or other similar scenarios.|$|E
25|$|The {{address bar}} {{features}} domain highlighting for added security {{so that the}} top-level domain is shown in black whereas {{the other parts of}} the URL are grayed out. Domain highlighting cannot be turned off by users or web sites. Other features of the address bar include support for pasting multi-line URLs and an improved model for inserting the selection caret, and selecting words, or entire URLs in the Address bar. The inline <b>autocomplete</b> feature has been dropped from Internet Explorer 8, leading to criticism by beta users.|$|E
25|$|A common {{application}} of a trie is storing a predictive text or <b>autocomplete</b> dictionary, such as found on a mobile telephone. Such applications {{take advantage of a}} trie's ability to quickly search for, insert, and delete entries; however, if storing dictionary words is all that is required (i.e., storage of information auxiliary to each word is not required), a minimal deterministic acyclic finite state automaton (DAFSA) would use less space than a trie. This is because a DAFSA can compress identical branches from the trie which correspond to the same suffixes (or parts) of different words being stored.|$|E

40|$|SQL Injections {{are still}} a {{prominent}} threat on the web. Using a custom built tool, BlindCanSeeQL (BCSQL), we will explore how to automate Blind SQL attacks to discover database schema using fewer requests than the standard methods, thus helping avoid detection from overloading a server with hits. This tool uses a web crawler to discover keywords that assist with <b>autocompleting</b> schema object names, along with improvements in ASCII bisection to lower the number of requests sent to the server. Along with this tool, we will discuss ways to prevent and protect against such attacks...|$|R
40|$|We are {{designing}} {{and developing a}} web user interface for digital mathematics libraries called WebMIaS. It allows queries to be expressed by mathematicians through a faceted search interface. Users can combine standard textual <b>autocompleted</b> keywords with keywords {{in the form of}} mathematical formulae in LaTeX or MathML formats. Formulae are shown rendered by the web browser on-the-fly for users' feedback. We describe WebMIaS design principles and our experiences deploying in the European Digital Mathematics Library (EuDML). We further describe the issues addressed by formulae canonicalization and by extending the MIaS indexing engine with Content MathML support. Comment: Preprint of CICM 2014 ([URL] paper: S. M.

25|$|Like {{any other}} IDE, it {{includes}} a code editor that supports syntax highlighting and code completion using IntelliSense for variables, functions, methods, loops and LINQ queries. IntelliSense is supported for the included languages, {{as well as for}} XML and for Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript when developing web sites and web applications. <b>Autocomplete</b> suggestions appear in a modeless list box over the code editor window, in proximity of the editing cursor. In Visual Studio 2008 onwards, it can be made temporarily semi-transparent to see the code obstructed by it. The code editor is used for all supported languages.|$|E
25|$|The Omnibox is a URL {{box that}} {{combines}} {{the functions of}} both the address bar and search box. If a user enters the URL of a site previously searched from, Chrome allows pressing Tab to search the site again directly from the Omnibox. When a user starts typing in the Omnibox, Chrome provides suggestions for previously visited sites (based on the URL or in-page text), popular websites (not necessarily visited before powered by Google Instant), and popular searches. Although Instant can be turned off, suggestions based on previously visited sites cannot be turned off. Chrome will also <b>autocomplete</b> the URLs of sites visited often. If a user types keywords into the Omnibox that don't match any previously visited websites and presses enter, Chrome will conduct the search using the default search engine.|$|E

However, {{he felt that the}} transition between the desktop and apps [...] "still tends to feel a bit disjointed and disconnected" [...] (even though the option to use the desktop wallpaper on the Start screen made it feel more integrated with the desktop interface rather than dissimilar), and that the restoration of the Start button made the two interfaces feel even more inconsistent because of how different it operates between the desktop and apps.|$|E
40|$|Google Suggest is {{a service}} {{incorporated}} within Google Web Search {{which was created}} to help user find the right search phrase by proposing the <b>autocompleting</b> popular phrases while typing. The paper presents a new network steganography method called StegSuggest which utilizes suggestions generated by Google Suggest as a hidden data carrier. The {{detailed description of the}} method's idea is backed up with the analysis of the network traffic generated by the Google Suggest to prove its feasibility. The traffic analysis was also performed to discover the occurrence of two TCP options: Window Scale and Timestamp which StegSuggest uses to operate.

500|$|The Start screen {{received}} several enhancements on Windows 8.1, including an extended [...] "All Apps" [...] view with sort modes (accessed by clicking a new down arrow button or swiping upward), small and extra-large sizes for tiles, and colored tiles for desktop program shortcuts. Additional customization options were also added, such as expanded color options, new backgrounds (some of which incorporate animated elements), {{and the ability}} for the Start screen to use the desktop background instead. Applications are no longer added to the Start screen automatically when installed, and all applications now have colored tiles (desktop programs were previously shown in a single color). The app snapping system has also been extended; up to four apps can be snapped onto a single display depending on screen size, apps can be snapped to fill half the screen, and {{can also be used}} on any display in a multi-monitor configuration. Apps can also launch other apps in a snapped view to display content; for example, the Mail app can open a photo attachment in a picture viewer snapped to another half of the screen. Improved support is also provided by apps for using devices in a portrait (vertical) orientation. The lock screen offers the ability to use a photo slideshow as its backdrop, and a shortcut to the Camera app by swiping up. The on-screen keyboard has an improved <b>autocomplete</b> mechanism which displays multiple word suggestions, and allows users to select from them by sliding on the spacebar. The <b>autocomplete</b> dictionary is also automatically updated using data from Bing, allowing it to recognize and suggest words relating to current trends and events. Similarly to Windows Phone, certain apps now display a narrow bar with three dots on it to indicate the presence of a pop-up menu accessible by swiping, clicking on the dots, or right-clicking.|$|E

The rear of the device is coated in a [...] "glass weave" [...] material. The screen can be slid up to reveal a hardware keyboard; similarly to the BlackBerry Passport, the keyboard is touch-sensitive and can register sliding gestures across its keys for scrolling, text selection, and <b>autocomplete</b> suggestions. The device's bezel also features dedicated camera and Convenience buttons. The Priv utilizes a hexa-core Snapdragon 808 system-on-chip with 3GB of RAM, consisting of four low-power Cortex-A53 cores and two Cortex-A57 cores, and includes a non-removable 3420mAh battery which BlackBerry claims can last for 22-and-a-half hours of [...] "mixed use". The Priv includes 32GB of internal storage, with the option to expand the amount of available storage using a microSD card up to 2TB in size. The device {{features a}}n 18-megapixel rear-facing camera with phase detection autofocus and optical image stabilization, and a 2-megapixel front camera.|$|E

Like web addresses, e-mail addresses are often long, hence typing them completely is inconvenient.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Autocomplete</b> of {{source code}} {{is also known}} as code completion. In a source code editor <b>autocomplete</b> is greatly {{simplified}} by the regular structure of the programming languages. There are usually {{only a limited number of}} words meaningful in the current context or namespace, such as names of variables and functions. An example of code completion is Microsoft's IntelliSense design. It involves showing a pop-up list of possible completions for the current input prefix to allow the user to choose the right one. This is particularly useful in object-oriented programming because often the programmer will not know exactly what members a particular class has. Therefore, <b>autocomplete</b> then serves as a form of convenient documentation as well as an input method. Another beneficial feature of <b>autocomplete</b> for source code is that it encourages the programmers to use longer, more descriptive variable names incorporating both lower and upper case letters (CamelCase), hence making the source code more readable. Typing large words with many mixed cases like [...] "numberOfWordsPerParagraph" [...] can be difficult, but <b>Autocomplete</b> allows one to complete typing the word using a fraction of the keystrokes.|$|E
