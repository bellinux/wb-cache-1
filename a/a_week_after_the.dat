5|$|The {{governments of}} Oaxaca and Guerrero asked UNICEF for assistance, {{specifically}} water tanks, water pumps, and construction material. International aid initially focused almost {{solely on the}} damage in Acapulco. By <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> hurricane, 500communities in Oaxaca remained isolated and without assistance, with several large communities in Guerrero not receiving any material aid by <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> hurricane. The Adventist Development and Relief Agency organized about 7tons of food and clothing, and sent a bus of 40people to help isolated villages in southern Mexico. Around ten days after the hurricane struck, 20,000people were still isolated from emergency crews and relief works, causing the president to suspect people could begin starving to death. Helicopters were initially sent to the remote areas, though severe fog and heavy rainfall after the hurricane grounded the operations. The government worked to bring food to remote mountain communities, though officials noted the serious risk in doing so.|$|E

Protesters sat down on University Avenue, occupying {{a large portion of the}} street. On the third day of the non-stop protest (29 April), fifteen arrests were made while one woman was injured after a brief scuffle with police. This incident was the first one to happen among these protests in Canada. The protests later shifted to Queen's Park with a diminished number of protesters.|$|E

A total of 1,157 homes were destroyed and another 24,638 sustained damage, leaving approximately 200,000 people homeless. Damage from the storm was placed at $4.3million. In light of the severity of damage caused by Sarah, a state of calamity was declared for northern provinces.

He flew his first mission in July 1966, joining a F-100 Super Sabre flight group for a bombing run that damaged several buildings held by the Viet Cong in South Vietnam. He returned on leave to Homestead about <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> mission.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the riot, federal troops were deployed in Rock Springs. They escorted the surviving Chinese miners, most of whom had fled to Evanston, Wyoming, back to Rock Springs <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> riot. Reaction came swiftly from the era's publications. In Rock Springs, the local newspaper endorsed the outcome of the riot, while in other Wyoming newspapers, support for the riot was limited to sympathy for the causes of the white miners. The massacre in Rock Springs touched off a wave of anti-Chinese violence, especially in the Puget Sound area of Washington Territory.|$|E

5|$|Most of Acapulco {{remained}} {{closed for}} at least <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> hurricane.

Tourism greatly decreased following the hurricane, causing some hotels to charge 40percent less than normal in an attempt to bring people back. One airline offered two plane tickets for the price of one from Mexico City to Acapulco. Most hotels were almost completely back to normal around a month after the hurricane.|$|E
