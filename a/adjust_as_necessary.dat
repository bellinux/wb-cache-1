Within the SARGEN_IV project under the Euratom Framework Programme FP 7, an extensive {{work has been done}} to review the critical safety features of the reactor concepts developed under ESNII. This review has also been used as a reference to provide guidelines on the structure and content of the Safety Analysis Report (SAR) for the innovative ESNII reactors. Structure and content of a SAR generally differ among countries. The approach followed to give recommendations and guidance was to adopt as far as possible the format of the current practices for LWR based on the US NRC Reg Guide 1. 70 together with IAEA publication GS-G- 4. 1 and to identify those chapters whose subjects need to be adapted to the specific design. Due to the innovative nature of the design, the licensing process for new ESNII concepts may take longer. The early involvement of regulators in defining safety objectives and criteria and acceptable solutions to meet these criteria may be beneficial to shorten this process. Therefore, it is recommended that parts of the SAR should be submitted to the regulatory body at an early stage and in accordance with an agreed timetable; this approach will permit a smoother review process and help preventing unnecessary delays...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{complexity}} of mass storage systems at major data centers is causing stress on system administrators to keep performance at optimal levels. As storage requirements grow, {{so does the}} number of routine tasks that the administrator must perform, {{as well as the}} time it takes for these to be executed. The solution being proposed to ease this burden is the Mass Storage System Administrator Autonomic Assistant (MSSAAA). The MSSAAA is a collection of agents that perform some of the more common tasks while the administrators handle higher-level issues. Using the principles of autonomic computing, the MSSAAA is governed by a centralized set of policies that the administrator will review on a regular basis and can <b>adjust</b> <b>as</b> <b>necessary.</b> The goal is to develop an autonomic assistant to substantially reduce the amount of time it takes to address specific problems in the system. Using tools such as IBM’s Generic Log Adapter, Resource Model Builder, and Autonomic Management Engine, the MSSAAA has been able to (i) quickly determine when tape errors occur and correct them, (ii) monitor the network file system mounts for poor performance and report those, and (iii) correct network file system handle problems through continuous monitoring. The preliminary savings analyses show that the assistant saves the system administrator at least 185 hours per year, and over six thousand dollars in related costs. The results show how efficiently and effectively the MSSAAA handled its assigned tasks, and how it has eased the daily burden of storage system administrators...|$|E

30|$|In this article, {{we review}} {{the essence of}} the {{micromechanics}} based analytic tool set, emphasizing its use in controlling the composite matrix, fiber, and fiber/matrix interface ingredients for achieving targeted properties and special attributes. For illustration of this approach, we shall discuss three example ECC materials with the attributes/functions of light-weightedness, high early strength, and self-healing, respectively. These example materials were chosen to highlight the effects of controlling the matrix fracture toughness, the fiber/matrix interface, and the matrix flaw size on the composite behavior. In each case, ECC M 45 was used as a template, with ingredient modifications made to attain the special attributes, and then <b>adjusted</b> <b>as</b> <b>necessary</b> to maintain the unique tensile ductility of ECCs. It is emphasized that the availability of the micromechanics based analytic tool set removes a lot of guesswork, which allows systematic and effective tailoring of material ingredients to efficiently attain the desired material behavior.|$|R

DESIGN: Controlled clinical trial. ANIMALS: 15 dogs undergoing surgery because of acute thoracolumbar disk disease. PROCEDURES: Dogs were alternately assigned to treatment (conventional analgesics and adjunct EAP) and control (conventional analgesics alone) groups. Analgesic treatment was <b>adjusted</b> <b>as</b> <b>necessary</b> by the attending clinician, who was not aware of group assignment. Pain scores were assigned 1, 3, and 12 hours after surgery and every 12 hours thereafter for 72 hours by the same individual who performed acupuncture treatments. RESULTS: Total dose of fentanyl administered during the first 12 hours after surgery was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group, but dosages of analgesics administered from 12 through 72 hours after surgery did not differ between groups. Pain score was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group 36 hours after surgery, but did not differ significantly between groups at any other time.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{deployment of}} {{variable renewable energy}} sources (VRES) is changing the source regime in the electrical energy sector. However, VRES feed-in from wind turbines and photovoltaic systems {{is dependent on the}} weather and only partially predictable. As a result, existing energy sector models must be re-evaluated and <b>adjusted</b> <b>as</b> <b>necessary.</b> In long-term forecast models, the expansion of VRES {{must be taken into account}} so that future local overloads can be identified and measures taken. This paper focuses on one input factor for electrical energy models: the electrical load. We compare two different types to describe this, namely vertical grid load and total load. For the total load, an approach for a spatially-resolved electrical load model is developed and applied at the municipal level in Germany. This model provides detailed information about the load at a quarterly-hour resolution across 11, 268 German municipalities. In municipalities with concentrations of energy-intensive industry, high loads are expected, which our simulation reproduces with a good degree of accuracy. Our results also show that municipalities with energy-intensive industry have a higher simulated electric load than neighboring municipalities that do not host energy-intensive industries.
