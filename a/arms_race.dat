5|$|A {{study in}} 2014 shows that Dimetrodon {{was in an}} <b>arms</b> <b>race</b> against its prey. The smaller species, D.milleri had no {{serrations}} since it ate small prey. As the prey grew larger, Dimetrodon started developing serrations and increasing in size. D.limbatus had enamel serrations that help it cut through flesh, and the same serrations {{can be found on}} Secodontosaurus. The second largest dimetrodon species, D.grandis, has denticle serrations similar to sharks and theropod dinosaurs, making its teeth even more specialized to slice through flesh. This study not only shows the evolution of Dimetrodon over millions of years, but also shows that Dimetrodon was in an <b>arms</b> <b>race</b> against its prey. As prey grew larger, Dimetrodon countered it by growing larger and having sharper teeth.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we look at}} the {{relationship}} of <b>arms</b> <b>races</b> to war, with appropriate consideration of rivalries. Are <b>arms</b> <b>races</b> more common in rivalries than in lesser competitions? Are they merely a consequence of rivalry competitions? How do the patterns of <b>arms</b> <b>races</b> map with those of war in rivalries? We explore these concerns with an empirical examination of rivalry and non-rivalry populations in the 1816 - 2000 period. In brief, we find that: <b>arms</b> <b>races</b> occur most frequently in the context of enduring rivalries; <b>arms</b> <b>races</b> are more likely in the middle and later stages of rivalry; the frequency of <b>arms</b> <b>races</b> is higher in rivalries with war than rivalries that do not experience war; and only when <b>arms</b> <b>races</b> occur in the later phases of rivalries is there an increased chance of war. Our study narrows the scope of the arms race-war relationship relative to past studies, demonstrating that the arms race-war relationship is conditional on rivalry processes. arms races; conflict; Heckman selection model; rivalry...|$|R
40|$|This volume {{provides}} {{the first comprehensive}} history of the <b>arms</b> <b>racing</b> phenomenon in modern international politics, drawing both on theoretical approaches and on the latest historical research. Written by an international team of specialists, it is divided into four sections: before 1914; the inter-war years; the Cold War; and extra-European and post-Cold War <b>arms</b> <b>races.</b> Twelve case studies examine land and naval armaments before the First World War; air, land, and naval competition during the 1920 s and 1930 s; and nuclear as well as conventional weapons since 1945. Armaments policies are placed {{within the context of}} technological development, international politics and diplomacy, and social politics and economics. An extended general introduction and conclusion and introductions to each section provide coherence between the specialized chapters and draw out wider implications for policymakers and for political scientists. <b>Arms</b> <b>Races</b> in International Politics addresses two key questions: what causes <b>arms</b> <b>races,</b> and what is the connection between <b>arms</b> <b>races</b> and the outbreak of wars...|$|R

5|$|Negotiations {{initially}} {{focused on}} a comprehensive ban, but this was abandoned due to technical questions surrounding the detection of underground tests and Soviet concerns over the intrusiveness of proposed verification methods. The impetus for the test ban was provided by rising public anxiety over the magnitude of nuclear tests, particularly tests of new thermonuclear weapons (hydrogen bombs), and the resulting nuclear fallout. A test ban was also seen {{as a means of}} slowing nuclear proliferation and the nuclear <b>arms</b> <b>race.</b> Though the PTBT did not halt proliferation or the <b>arms</b> <b>race,</b> its enactment did coincide with a substantial decline in the concentration of radioactive particles in the atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|The Argentine–Chilean naval <b>arms</b> <b>race</b> was {{extremely}} expensive for both countries. The Argentine government {{was able to}} purchase £4,534,800 worth of ships between 1890 and 1898 with large foreign loans, which were given to them despite the country's role in the Baring crisis of 1890. The government's total foreign debt reached 421million gold pesos by 1896. As for Chile, it was forced {{to take out a}} £2million pound loan in order to purchase Krupp weaponry, and this combined with its other loans led the banking industry to suspend loans to Chile until the diplomatic crisis with Argentina was solved. Both the Argentine President Julio Argentino Roca and American ambassador to Argentina William Paine Lord ascribed the ending of the <b>arms</b> <b>race</b> to the diminished credit of Argentina and Chile.|$|E

Provisions in the dispute-ending treaty imposed restrictions on both countries' navies.
