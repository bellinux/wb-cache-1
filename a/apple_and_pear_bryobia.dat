Product origin, e. g. state and national, influenced consumers' expenditures for Red Delicious <b>apples</b> <b>and</b> pears; it was insignificant in other share equations. Product information, e. g. tart or sweet, only influenced expenditures on apple varieties that are less familiar to the consumer. The size of point-of-purchase material had a significant effect on expenditures as did display sizes to a lesser extent.
