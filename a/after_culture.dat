500|$|A {{shortlist}} of finalists {{is drawn}} up and usually published {{about six months}} before the prize is awarded in November or December each year, although shortlists were not made public in 1988 and 1990; in 1989, a list of seven [...] "commended" [...] artists was published. [...] Controversy surrounded the presentation of the inaugural prize to Malcolm Morley as some critics [...] "questioned his relevance" [...] to art in Britain; he had lived and worked in the United States for the previous 20 years. [...] Since its inception, the prize itself has received considerable criticism. In 2002, <b>after</b> <b>Culture</b> Minister Kim Howells described the Turner Prize as [...] "conceptual bullshit", Prince Charles wrote a letter of support to him, stating [...] "It has contaminated the art establishment for so long". Since 2000, the Stuckists art group have protested against the prize; in 2008, they gave out leaflets with the message [...] "The Turner Prize is Crap", to protest at the lack of figurative paintings amongst the nominees' exhibitions.|$|E

40|$|The {{ratio of}} free to thylakoid-bound {{chloroplast}} ribosomes in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii undergoes periodic changes during the synchronous light-dark cycle. In the light, {{when there is}} an increase in the chlorophyll content and synthesis of thylakoid membrane proteins, about 20 - 30 % of the chloroplast ribosomes are bound to the thylakoid membranes. On the other hand, only a few or no bound ribosomes are present in the dark when there is no increase in the chlorophyll content. The ribosome-membrane interaction depends not only on the developmental stage of the cell but also on light.

40|$|High {{concentrations}} of glucose have a protective {{effect on the}} glucoreceptor mechanism for insulin secretion during culture of pancreatic islets in chemically defined media. To study at what level glucose exerts this effect, insulin secretion from β-cell-rich mouse pancreatic islets was measured before and <b>after</b> <b>culture</b> for 1 week {{in the presence of}} different substances. Before culture, glucose and inosine were potent stimulators, mannose and fructose were less potent and xylitol had no effect on secretion. Culture in 3 mm-glucose resulted in a 10 -fold decrease in the insulin response to glucose stimulation. A less marked decrease was noted <b>after</b> <b>culture</b> in 20 mm- or 30 mm-glucose. Inosine-stimulated secretion was much decreased <b>after</b> <b>culture</b> in high {{concentrations of}} glucose, whereas the responses to mannose or fructose were unchanged. <b>After</b> <b>culture</b> in 30 mm-mannose, glucose-stimulated secretion was similar to that observed <b>after</b> <b>culture</b> in high concentrations of glucose, whereas the response to mannose had much decreased. There were no secretory responses to glucose or fructose <b>after</b> <b>culture</b> in 30 mm-fructose, or to glucose or xylitol <b>after</b> <b>culture</b> in 30 mm-xylitol. Culture in 10 mm-inosine did not preserve any significant response to glucose or inosine. The insulin contents of islets and culture media were higher <b>after</b> <b>culture</b> in high concentrations of glucose, mannose or inosine than <b>after</b> <b>culture</b> in fructose, xylitol or low concentrations of glucose.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The debate {{concerning}} the potential remodelling and/or reversibility of cirrhotic lesions and biliary fibrosis is still open. AIMS/METHODS: In this work, {{we have used}} the precision-cut liver slice (PCLS) model, which maintains cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions to study, by immunohistochemistry, the behaviour of the different fibrogenic cells, i. e. hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and portal fibroblasts, in cultured (for 1 week) PCLS derived from normal and fibrotic human livers. RESULTS: In normal liver, before and <b>after</b> <b>culture,</b> α-smooth muscle (SM) actin was present only in the vessel walls. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor-β was expressed before and <b>after</b> <b>culture</b> by portal fibroblasts, and appeared <b>after</b> <b>culture</b> in HSC. Before culture, CD 34 was not expressed in parenchyma, but appeared <b>after</b> <b>culture</b> in sinusoidal endothelial cells. In cirrhotic lesions, before culture, α-SM actin, PDGF receptor-β and Thy- 1 were expressed in septa; <b>after</b> <b>culture,</b> α-SM actin expression disappeared but {{the expression of the}} PDGF receptor-β and Thy- 1 was maintained. In cholestatic liver specimens, α-SM actin, PDGF receptor-β and Thy- 1 expression, which was present before culture in enlarged portal areas, disappeared <b>after</b> <b>culture,</b> and apoptosis was detected. In the parenchyma of both cirrhotic and cholestatic livers, the expression of the PDGF receptor-β and of CD 34, which was not observed before culture, was present in HSC and sinusoidal endothelial cells, respectively, <b>after</b> <b>culture.</b> CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that during remodelling of pathological tissues in cultured liver slices, the myofibroblastic cells derived from HSC or from portal fibroblasts show different behaviours, suggesting different mechanisms of activation/deactivation...|$|E
