Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), which announced celestial observations through his telescope, does not explicitly mention Copernican heliocentrism, a theory that placed the Sun at the center of the universe.

5|$|Humans {{entered the}} Americas through Beringia, and {{evidence}} documents {{their interactions with}} Columbian mammoths. Tools made from Columbian mammoth remains have been discovered in several North American sites. At Tocuila, Mexico, mammoth bones were quarried 13,000 years ago to produce lithic flakes and cores. At the Lange-Ferguson Site in South Dakota, the remains of two mammoths were found with two 12,800-year-old cleaver choppers made from a mammoth shoulder blade; the choppers {{had been used to}} butcher the mammoths. At the same site, a flake knife made from a long mammoth bone was also found wedged against mammoth vertebrae. At Murray Springs, archaeologists discovered a 13,100-year-old object made from a mammoth femur; the object is thought to be a shaft wrench, <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> straightening wood and bone to make spear-shafts (the Inuit use similar tools).|$|E

5|$|Often {{categorized}} as a rationalist philosopher, Wollstonecraft demonstrates {{her commitment to}} and appreciation of feeling in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. She argues that subjective experiences, such as the transcendent emotions prompted by the sublime and the beautiful, possess a value equal to the objective truths discovered through reason. In Wollstonecraft's earlier works, reason was paramount, because it allowed access to universal truths. In Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, however, reason serves as <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> reflection, mediating between the sensual experiences {{of the world and}} an abstract notion of truth (not necessarily universal truth). Maturation is not only the acquisition of reason—the view Wollstonecraft had adopted in Original Stories from Real Life (1788)—but also an understanding of when and how to trust one's emotions.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} {{example of}} a matrix model is the BFSS matrix model proposed by Tom Banks, Willy Fischler, Stephen Shenker, and Leonard Susskind in 1997. This theory describes {{the behavior of a}} set of nine large matrices. In their original paper, these authors showed, among other things, that the low energy limit of this matrix model is described by eleven-dimensional supergravity. These calculations led them to propose that the BFSS matrix model is exactly equivalent to M-theory. The BFSS matrix model can therefore be used as a prototype for a correct formulation of M-theory and <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> investigating the properties of M-theory in a relatively simple setting.|$|E

5|$|Richard Nixon: The Shaping of His Character was {{published}} in late 1981 and received reviews less enthusiastic than any of her earlier books. Writing in The New Republic, Godfrey Hodgson questioned both her psychoanalytic approach and her motives: “e {{are in danger of}} having the insights of psychotherapy used as <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> character destruction, certainly for libel, potentially for revenge.” Sales of the book were disappointing, {{in part because of the}} reviews, in part because memoirs by Nixon associates such as Henry Kissinger, John Ehrlichman, and John Dean had recently flooded the market. Perhaps Brodie’s book was most influential in stimulating Oliver Stone to create his controversial 1995 movie Nixon.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 novel , {{published}} by HarperEntertainment as a tie-innovelization, expanded on the backstories of Passions prominent characters, {{such as the}} romantic relationship between Eve Russell and Julian Crane {{and the fate of}} their child.

According to the novel, Vincent was born on Christmas day. Alistair Crane arranges for Vincent to be killed, but the hitman places the baby into social services without his knowledge. In the series, Alistair does not order for Vincent's death, and instead kidnaps him as an infant to abuse him and turn him into <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> his schemes to maintain control over the fictional town of Harmony.|$|E
