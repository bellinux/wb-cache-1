2500|$|According to {{traditional}} Judaism, people's actions {{do not have}} the ability to affect God positively or negatively.

If you sinned, how do you harm God, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> transgressions are many, {{what do you do to}} God? If you are righteous, what do you give God? Or what does God take from your hand? Your wickedness [...] a person like yourself, and your righteousness a child of humanity." ...|$|E
2500|$|After graduating IU's law in 1926, Carmichael {{moved to}} Florida, {{where he worked}} as a law clerk in a West Palm Beach legal firm, but he {{returned}} to Indiana in 1927 after failing the Florida bar exam. He joined an Indianapolis law firm (Bingham, Mendenhall and Bingham) and passed the Indiana bar, but devoted most of his energies to music, arranging gigs, and [...] "writing tunes." [...] Carmichael had discovered his method of songwriting, which he described later: [...] "You don't write melodies, you find them…If you find the beginning of a good song, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> fingers do not stray, the melody should come out of hiding in a short time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Like Wooden, Scates {{established}} himself as an innovator, changing a deliberate game to the fast paced sport it is today. [...] "Until the late ’60s, the game was a very slow game,” Scates said. [...] "You didn’t try to deceive anybody. You just tried to set a high ball to the outside <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> hitter {{was better than the}} blockers you scored a point. By the late 1960s we started setting very quick here at UCLA. We started running an offense that is still being run today.” Said USC coach Bill Ferguson “He is responsible for so much of our sport’s development that we {{will never be able to}} fathom what he did to promote our game. He is the best in-game tactician there ever was.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Even modern grandmasters {{study the}} book. Frank Brady {{wrote in his}} {{biography}} of World Champion Bobby Fischer that Chess Openings Ancient and Modern {{was one of the}} most heavily annotated books in Fischer's personal library. Fischer had pencilled in his own analyses of the Scotch Game, Giuoco Piano, Evans Gambit, Bishop's Gambit, Danish Gambit, and other openings. Specifically referring to the analysis in Chess Openings Ancient and Modern, Grandmaster Robert Byrne wrote in a 1991 New York Times chess column, [...] "Ingenious strategies and tactics were tried out in the old days, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> opponent knows them and you don't, you are in for a pounding." [...] Likewise Fischer, in his famous book My 60 Memorable Games, annotating an Evans Gambit that he had won against Reuben Fine, cited analysis from the 1893 edition of Chess Openings Ancient and Modern as an improvement on Fine's ninth move.|$|E
2500|$|Smaller tanks, such as {{the plastic}} 208-litre (55-gallon barrel) are also used in some cases. Modern modular systems which are scalable, like the 193 litre (51 gal) Rainwater HOG module and the 500 litre (133 gallon) Stratco Aquabarrel {{can be used to}} decentralize the {{rainwater}} catchment by storing smaller volumes at each downspout. [...] Larger tanks are commonly used where there is no access to a centralised water supply. Companies such as Solar Survival Architecture recommend [...] a 300-gallon (1135 litre) tank for a house supporting 2 people (if compost toilets are placed) <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> region receives 762mm of precipitation a year. If it receives less (between 254mm and 762mm), 2 or 3 of these 300 gallon tanks can be placed (so that more rain can be gathered at times when it does rain). Also affecting tank size is predicted rainfall and rainfall variability; the higher prices for larger tanks; intended use of rainwater and typical consumption for these uses; the area of roof draining into the tank; security of supply desired.|$|E

2500|$|On 29 May 1942 it was {{announced}} that all Jews living in the occupied zone had to wear a yellow star of David with the words Juif or Juive written on it at all times by 7 June 1942. Ousby described the purpose of the yellow star [...] "not just to identify but [...] to humiliate, and it worked".On 14 June 1942, a 12-year-old Jewish boy committed suicide in Paris as his classmates were now shunning the boy with the yellow star. As a form of quiet protest, many Jewish veterans started to wear their medals alongside the yellow star, which led the Germans to ban all Jewish veterans from wearing their medals alongside the yellow stars of David due to being [...] "inappropriate", as it increased popular sympathy for men who fought and suffered for France. At times, ordinary people would show sympathy for Jews; as a Scot married to a Frenchman, Janet Teissier du Cros wrote in her diary about a Jewish woman wearing her yellow star of David going shopping: [...] "She came humbly up and stood hesitating {{on the edge of the}} pavement. Jews were not allowed to stand in queues. What they were supposed to do I never discovered. But the moment the people in the queue saw her they signed to her to join us. Secretly and rapidly, as in the game of hunt-the-slipper, she was passed up till she stood at the head of the queue. I am glad to say that not one voice was raised in protest, the policeman standing near turned his head away, and that she got her cabbage before any of us".By 1942, the Paris Kommandantur was receiving an average of 1,500 corbeaux (poison pen letters) a day. One corbeaux written by a Frenchwoman read:"Since you are taking care of the Jews, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> campaign is not just a vain word, then have a look at the kind of life led by the girl M.A, formerly a dancer, now living at 41 Boulevard de Strasbourg, not wearing a star. This creature, for whom being Jewish is not enough, debauches the husbands of proper Frenchwomen, and you may well have an idea what she is living off. Defend women against Jewishness-that will be your best publicity, and you will return a French husband to his wife". In the summer of 1942, a committee consisting of SS Hauptsturmführer Theodor Dannecker, the Commissioner for Jewish Affairs Louis Darquier de Pellepoix, and general secretary of the police René Bousquet had been planning a grand rafle (great round-up) of Jews to deport to the death camps. On the morning of 16 July 1942, the grand rafle was launched with 9,000 French policemen rounding up the Jews of Paris, leading to some 12,762 Jewish men, women and children being arrested and brought to the Val d'Hiv sports stadium, from where they were sent to the Drancy camp and finally Auschwitz. The grand rafle was a joint operation; the overwhelming majority of those who arrested the Jews were French policemen. During the grand rafle, some 100 Jews warned by friends in the police killed themselves, while 24 Jews were killed resisting arrest. One Jewish Frenchwoman, Madame Rado, who was arrested during the grand rafle with her four children, noted about the watching bystanders: [...] "Their expressions were empty, apparently indifferent". When taken with the other Jews to the Place Voltaire, one woman was heard to shout [...] "Well done! Well done!" [...] while the man standing to her warned her [...] "After them, it'll be us. Poor people!". Rado herself survived Auschwitz, but her four children were killed in the gas chambers.|$|E
