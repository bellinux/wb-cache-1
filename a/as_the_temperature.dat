5|$|From {{approximately}} 10−6 {{seconds after}} the Big Bang, during a period {{is known as the}} hadron epoch, the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow quarks to bind together into hadrons, and the mass of the Universe was dominated by hadrons. Initially the temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs, which kept matter and antimatter in thermal equilibrium. However, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> of the Universe continued to fall, hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced. Most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in particle-antiparticle annihilation reactions, leaving a small residual of hadrons by the time the Universe was about one second old.|$|E
5|$|Most ionic {{compounds}} {{are very}} brittle.

5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} bromide is a colourless gas, {{like all the}} hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen bromide}} at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> is raised. Aqueous hydrogen bromide is known as hydrobromic acid, which is a strong acid (pKa = −9) because the hydrogen bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/H2O system also involves many hydrates HBr·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine anions and hydronium cations. Hydrobromic acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 124.3°C at 47.63g HBr per 100g solution; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E

5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} chloride is a colourless gas, {{like all the}} hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the larger electronegative chlorine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen chloride}} at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> is raised. Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid (pKa = −7) because the hydrogen bonds to chlorine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HCl/H2O system has many hydrates HCl·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Beyond a 1:1 mixture of HCl and H2O, the system separates completely into two separate liquid phases. Hydrochloric acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 108.58°C at 20.22g HCl per 100g solution; thus hydrochloric acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E
5|$|Each engine main {{combustion}} chamber (MCC) receives fuel-rich hot gas from a hot-gas manifold cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants. A small augmented-spark igniter-chamber {{is located in}} the center of the injector, and this dual-redundant igniter is used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The igniters are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly are welded to the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also bolted to the hot-gas manifold. The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> in the {{combustion chamber}} reaches 3300°C (6000°F) during flight – higher than the boiling point of iron.|$|E
5|$|Nanostructures of ZnO can be {{synthesized}} into {{a variety}} of morphologies including nanowires, nanorods, tetrapods, nanobelts, nanoflowers, nanoparticles etc. Nanostructures can be obtained with most above-mentioned techniques, at certain conditions, and also with the vapor-liquid-solid method. The synthesis is typically carried out at temperatures of about 90°C, in an equimolar aqueous solution of zinc nitrate and hexamine, the latter providing the basic environment. Certain additives, such as polyethylene glycol or polyethylenimine, can improve the aspect ratio of the ZnO nanowires. Doping of the ZnO nanowires has been achieved by adding other metal nitrates to the growth solution. The morphology of the resulting nanostructures can be tuned by changing the parameters relating to the precursor composition (such as the zinc concentration and pH) or to the thermal treatment (such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> and heating rate).|$|E

5|$|Neptunium is a hard, silvery, ductile, {{radioactive}} actinide metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide uranium, to the left of the actinide plutonium and below the lanthanide promethium. Neptunium is a hard metal, having a bulk modulus of 118GPa, comparable to that of manganese. Neptunium metal is similar to uranium in terms of physical workability. When exposed to air at normal temperatures, it forms a thin oxide layer. This reaction proceeds more rapidly <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> increases. Neptunium has been determined to melt at 639±3°C: this low melting point, a property the metal shares with the neighboring element plutonium (which has melting point 639.4°C), is due to the hybridization of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in the metal. The boiling point of neptunium is not empirically known and the usually given value of 4174°C is extrapolated from the vapor pressure of the element. If accurate, this would give neptunium the largest liquid range of any element (3535K passes between its melting and boiling points).|$|E
5|$|The {{ranges of}} the American and Chinese {{alligator}} extend into regions that sometimes experience periods of frost in winter. Being ectothermic, the internal body temperature of crocodilians falls <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> drops, {{and they become}} sluggish. They may become more active on warm days, but do not usually feed at all during the winter. In cold weather, they remain submerged with their tails in deeper, less cold water and their nostrils just projecting through the surface. If ice forms on the water, they maintain ice-free breathing holes, {{and there have been}} occasions when their snouts have become frozen into the ice. Temperature sensing probes implanted in wild American alligators have found that their core body temperatures can descend to around , but as long as they remain able to breathe they show no ill effects when the weather warms up.|$|E
5|$|Most procellariids' nests are in burrows or on {{the surface}} on open ground, with a smaller number nesting {{under the cover of}} {{vegetation}} (such as in a forest). All the fulmarine petrels bar the snow petrel nest in the open, the snow petrel instead nesting inside natural crevices. Of the rest of the procellariids the majority nest in burrows or crevices, with a few tropical species nesting in the open. There are several reasons for these differences. The fulmarine petrels are probably precluded from burrowing by their large size (the crevice-nesting snow petrel is the smallest fulmarine petrel) and the high latitudes they breed in, where frozen ground is difficult to burrow into. The smaller size of the other species, and their lack of agility on land, mean that even on islands free from mammal predators they are still vulnerable to skuas, gulls and other avian predators, something the aggressive oil-spitting fulmars are not. The chicks of all species are vulnerable to predation, but the chicks of fulmarine petrels can defend themselves in a similar fashion to their parents. In the higher latitudes there are thermal advantages to burrow nesting, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> is more stable than on the surface, and there is no wind-chill to contend with. The absence of skuas, gulls and other predatory birds on tropical islands is why some shearwaters and two species of gadfly petrel can nest in the open. This has the advantages of reducing competition with burrow nesters from other species and allowing open-ground nesters to nest on coralline islets without soil for burrowing. Procellariids that burrow in order to avoid predation almost always attend their colonies nocturnally in order to reduce predation as well. Of the ground-nesting species the majority attend their colonies during the day, the exception being the herald petrel, which is thought to be vulnerable to the diurnal white-bellied sea eagle.|$|E
