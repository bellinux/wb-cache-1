5|$|Although the {{territorial}} gains produced by his {{defeat of the}} Persians were lost to the advance of the Muslims, Heraclius still ranks among the great Roman Emperors. His reforms of the government reduced the corruption which had taken hold in Phocas's reign, and he reorganized the military with great success. Ultimately, the reformed Imperial army halted the Muslims in Asia Minor <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>on</b> to Carthage for another 60 years, saving a core from which the empire's strength could be rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, the 1995 season started on April 25, and was shortened to 144 games instead of the normal 162. California took an early lead in the AL West standings and traded first place with Texas through May and June. They took the lead on July 2, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>on</b> to that lead throughout the rest of July and all of August. Seattle, meanwhile, spent most of June through August in third or fourth place. They would bottom out on August 2, 13 games out of first place.|$|E

Nearly three quarters of the votes were cast against the law. After both election and referendum results were announced, the Prime Minister Janez Janša announced that he might resign, following what he perceived to be a heavy defeat for the Government. The Government later won a vote of confidence in the National Assembly.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, Madlax and Margaret {{meet and}} {{embark on a}} search for Quanzitta Marison, a Gazth-Sonikan mystic who {{supposedly}} knows about Margaret's book, Enfant's involvement with it, and Enfant itself. Lady Quanzitta does indeed tell them about Enfant and its plans to plunge the entire world into a total war, starting with Gazth-Sonika. She reveals that Enfant's leader Friday Monday possesses supernatural powers connected to the three ancient books, one of which belongs to Margaret. Margaret uses her own supernatural abilities and that of her book to return her lost memories. Carrossea, who has been aiding Margaret, requests that his memories be restored as well despite warnings not to do so; he discovers that he, in fact, died 12 years ago <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>on</b> to life only by sheer force of will to protect Margaret. Carrossea disappears, and Margaret is captured by Monday who intends to use her abilities to advance his own plans.|$|E
5|$|He signed wing-back Paul Edwards <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>on</b> {{to most of}} his {{key players}} for the 2002–03 season. Wrexham had a good start to the season and Smith won the Manager of the Month award for September 2002 after a {{sequence}} of four wins and two draws. A slump followed but Wrexham recovered from a poor October 2002 after coming from behind to beat Bournemouth on 9 November, as strikers Andy Morrell and Lee Trundle formed a good partnership, with Jones an impact substitute. Wrexham {{dropped out of the}} play-off places following a sequence of draws in March 2003, but new signing Scott Green scored both goals in a 2–0 win over Hartlepool United on 18 March, the first of a sequence of eight victories that took Wrexham into the third automatic promotion place with four matches to go. They held on to the position to secure promotion from the Third Division at the first attempt. Wrexham also beat Newport County 6–1 in the final of the FAW Premier Cup to secure an important £100,000 in prize money. Smith was named as the Manager of the Month for April and 2003, before winning the League Managers Association's Third Division Manager of the Season award.|$|E
5|$|In early 1999, Yoshiki Okamoto, {{then head}} of Capcom's screenwriter {{subsidiary}} Flagship, proposed his idea of remaking the original The Legend of Zelda for the Game Boy Color to Shigeru Miyamoto, the game designer at Nintendo who created the series. Okamoto was eventually asked to develop six Zelda games for the Game Boy Color: two based on earlier installments and four original entries into the series. Okamoto wanted to release them in quick succession of four to five months, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>on</b> to his concept of bringing the first game to the handheld console to make young children experience {{the merits of the}} original Zelda, but also as a test for the development team to move on to a more ambitious sequel if {{it turned out to be}} successful.|$|E

5|$|In {{its native}} United States, the American Cocker Spaniel was ranked the 23rd most popular breed {{according}} to registration statistics of the AKC in 2009, {{a decrease in}} popularity since 1999 when it was ranked 13th. For twenty five years the American Cocker Spaniel {{was the most popular}} dog in America. It was ranked number one first in 1936 prior to the English Cocker Spaniel being recognized as a separate breed, and held onto the spot until 1952 when Beagles became the most popular dog. It regained the spot in 1983 <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>on</b> at number one until 1990.

5|$|Late in 1991, Paul E. Dangerously {{formed the}} faction The Dangerous Alliance. Eaton {{joined the group}} when he {{assisted}} Rick Rude, whom Dangerously had (kayfabe) brought into WCW, in defeating Sting for the United States Championship. In joining the group, Eaton became allies with Rude, Larry Zbyszko, and his two former rivals for the World Television Championship in Arn Anderson and Steve Austin. Shortly after the group was formed, Anderson and Eaton became its tag team specialists. This seemed to make sense, as both men had been successful tag team wrestlers in their careers; Anderson himself had been a two-time world champion teaming with Tully Blanchard in the Four Horsemen and had also won the belts with Zbyszko earlier in the year. Eaton and Anderson quickly won the WCW World Tag Team Championship by defeating Ricky Steamboat and Dustin Rhodes, the team to whom Anderson and Zbyszko lost the belts, for the championship <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>on</b> to the belts for five months before they lost them to the Steiner Brothers.|$|E
5|$|When the 2016–17 season started, Harden {{was off to}} a great {{start and}} was widely {{considered}} a top MVP runner along with Kawhi Leonard plus former teammate Russell Westbrook. When the season ended, the Rockets were third in both the Western Conference and overall rankings, a major improvement from the season before. D'Antoni was named the NBA Coach of the Year, Eric Gordon the Sixth Man of the Year, and Harden finished second in MVP voting to Russell Westbrook. In the playoffs, the Rockets faced the sixth seeded Oklahoma City Thunder in a battle of the MVP frontrunners, as the winner was not announced until after the finals. The Rockets won the series 4–1 including Nene Hilario's perfect 12–12 in field goals in Game 4. But {{they went on to}} lose to the San Antonio Spurs in a six-game series, despite blowing out the Spurs in game 1 by 27 points. The Spurs tied the series 2-2 <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>on</b> to win game 5 as Manu Ginobili blocked James Harden's game tying three point attempt as time ran out, and won game 6 by 39 points, as with Nene's injury, the Rockets could not guard Lamarcus Aldridge, who scored 34 points and grabbed 12 rebounds.|$|E

5|$|With these resources, Henry {{erected a}} number of siege engines around the castle; one {{probable}} trebuchet and two mangonels were set up {{to the east of}} the castle; two mangonels were placed on the west side, to attack the keep, and one mangonel on both the north and south sides. Two siege-castles were established to observe the occupants of the castle. William was confident, however, that either his brother would return and relieve the siege, or that the pope would intervene, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>on</b> despite the artillery attacks. The losses in the royal army began to mount; chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall suggests that seven knights, and over 200 soldiers and labourers were killed as the siege dragged on.|$|E
5|$|A {{victory over}} San Francisco gave the Browns 10 wins {{in a row}} to start the regular season. The game was eagerly {{anticipated}} by both sides: San Francisco had started the season with 10 victories, while the Browns had won their first nine games. The 49ers relied heavily on their offense, which featured quarterback Frankie Albert and end Alyn Beals. The team came into the matchup with the Browns averaging 35.9 points per game. The Browns, meanwhile, were more proficient than the 49ers on defense and in placekicking: the team ranked first in the AAFC in fewest points allowed, and Groza held the league record for the longest field goal. The game began with a San Francisco fumble of Cleveland's opening kickoff that was recovered by Lou Saban. Several plays later, Graham ran 14 yards for a touchdown, giving the Browns their first points. San Francisco responded later in the period with a rushing touchdown by Joe Perry to tie the score. Cleveland struck back with an Edgar Jones touchdown in the third quarter, however, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>on</b> {{to win the game}} 14–7. Ara Parseghian was a standout on both offense and defense, batting down several of Albert's passes. The crowd of 82,769 set a professional football record. While Cleveland won, several key players suffered injuries. Speedie had a separated shoulder, while linebacker Bill Willis was kicked in the face and Tommy James hurt his ankle. Graham had his hand stepped on, and guard Weldon Humble suffered a chin injury.|$|E
5|$|At the Tour de Corse, Audi debuted the Quattro A2, {{which was}} 70kg (155lb) lighter {{and had an}} engine {{producing}} 30 more horsepower. Mouton's rally ended when her engine caught on fire. On the first stage in Greece, she rolled her car on a hairpin turn 18km (11mi) from the start. Rally New Zealand was for Mouton a repetition of the previous year; she took the lead on the seventh stage <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>on</b> to it until her A2's engine failed, with only six of the 33 stages to go. The three retirements in a row dropped Mouton to fifth place in the championship. She then finished third behind Mikkola and Blomqvist at the Rally Argentina, but this would remain her last podium finish of the season. At the 1000 Lakes in Finland, Mouton finished the first day in seventh place after setting two top-five stage times. Her car later caught on fire, but {{she was able to}} continue in the event by following Mikkola's advice and driving into a lake. With a string of top-ten times, she eventually finished 16th. In the Rallye Sanremo, the tarmac stages were dominated by the Lancia 037 and Mouton finished seventh after suffering from fuel injection problems. In the season-ending RAC Rally, she started well and held second place after the first twelve stages. An Audi mechanic later accidentally refilled Mouton's fuel tank with pure water which resulted in time-consuming repairs. She eventually retired after crashing out, and placed fifth overall in the drivers' championship. Although Mikkola beat Lancia's Röhrl and Alén to the drivers' title, Audi had lost the manufacturers' title to Lancia after the latter's triple win in Sanremo.|$|E
