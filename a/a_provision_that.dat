5|$|There was no {{official}} outcome from these hearings, but Congress subsequently passed a Consular Reform Bill which included <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> specifically {{would not allow}} a diplomat, such as Magoon, to hold a separate administrative position. Rather than remove Magoon {{from one of his}} positions, he was named to become vice governor-general of the Philippines. Ultimately, this offer was rescinded before it could take effect, and he was instead appointed governor of Cuba.|$|E
5|$|During {{the debate}} on health care reform, Franken {{was one of the}} strongest {{supporters}} of a single-payer system. He authored an amendment, called the Medical Loss Ratio, to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that required insurance companies spend at least 80% of premiums on actual health care costs, rising to 85% for large group plans. On September 30, 2013, Franken voted to remove <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> would repeal the medical device tax in Obamacare from a government funding bill. Although Franken says he is in favor of the provision, he disagreed with it being used as a condition in preventing the 2013 federal government shutdown.|$|E

5|$|Joseph G. Wilson {{started in}} 1853 as the clerk {{for the court}} and was {{responsible}} for the Oregon Reports until 1870, though he also served as a justice on the court from 1862 to 1870. Later federal judge Charles B. Bellinger then took over editing the reports, and served as clerk until 1880. He was followed by T. B. Odeneal, J. A. Stratton, and W. H. Holmes, until 1889 when a law was passed that included <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> the Chief Justice take over this responsibility. This arrangement only lasted a few years, as in 1891 a new law allowed the court to hire an official reporter, with later Chief Justice George H. Burnett serving as the first official reporter.|$|E
5|$|The 1891 {{constitution}} added <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> {{the governor}} must specify {{the reason for}} any specially-called legislative session, and that no other business could be considered during the session. There is, however, no constitutional requirement that the legislature conduct any business during the called session. In 2007, Republican governor Ernie Fletcher called the Assembly into session to consider {{a long list of}} items. The Democratically-controlled House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough that they could not wait until the regular session convened; they claimed that Fletcher was calling the session only to boost his sagging poll numbers before the upcoming election in which he faced a challenge from Democrat Steve Beshear. The House convened on the day appointed and adjourned an hour later without transacting any business.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the {{original}} release, a patch was available for the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 versions of the game, which contained over 200 quest and scripting-related fixes. The update released on December 14, 2010, has fixed further glitches and save game problems, including companion-related bugs. Subsequent updates were released in February and April that corrected numerous bugs and gameplay issues. A patch was released on July 5, 2011, that included <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> automatically creates a save prior to the endgame sequence.

5|$|Before {{the final}} {{convention}} in 1792, a committee composed of Garrard, Ambrose Dudley, and Augustine Eastin {{reported to the}} Elkhorn Baptist Association in favor of forbidding slavery in the constitution then being drafted for the new state. Slavery was {{a major issue in}} the 1792 convention that finalized the document. Delegate David Rice, a Presbyterian minister, was the leading voice against the inclusion of slavery protections in the new constitution, while George Nicholas argued most strenuously in favor of them. Garrard encouraged his fellow ministers and Baptists to vote against its inclusion. The motion to delete Article 9 of the proposed document, which protected the rights of slave owners, failed by a vote of 1626. Each of the seven Christian ministers who served as delegates to the convention (including Garrard) voted in favor of deleting the article. Five Baptist laymen defied Garrard's instructions and voted to retain Article 9; their votes provided the necessary margin for its inclusion. Historian Lowell H. Harrison wrote that the anti-slavery votes of the ministers may have accounted for the adoption of <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> forbade ministers from serving in the Kentucky General Assembly. Garrard and the other ministers apparently expressed no dissent against this provision.|$|E
5|$|For some time, {{there had}} been concern {{about the power of}} the railroads and the way they charged {{different}} rates for different customers. In 1885, a bill to regulate the practice, authored by John Henninger Reagan, of Texas passed the House. The Reagan bill forbade discrimination in railroad or pipeline freight rates, required that rates be reasonable, and fixed maximum charges allowed. Sherman agreed with the general idea of the law, but objected to certain portions, especially <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> gave state courts jurisdiction over enforcement disputes. Sherman believed the law should allow for more nuance as well, insisting that competition against other forms of transit be considered. These changes were adopted in the conference committee and the result, the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, owed much to Sherman's influence. Cleveland signed it into law on February 4, 1887, and appointed members to the new Interstate Commerce Commission. The act displeased the railroad industry, but was a boon to farmers and the oil industry.|$|E
5|$|The Great Powers occupying Paris {{demanded that}} Louis XVIII {{implement}} a constitution. Louis responded with the Charter of 1814, which included many progressive provisions: freedom of religion, a legislature {{composed of the}} Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Peers, a press that would enjoy a degree of freedom, and <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> the Biens nationaux would remain {{in the hands of}} their current owners. The constitution had 76 articles. Taxation was to be voted on by the chambers. Catholicism was to be the official religion of France. To be eligible for membership in the Chamber of Deputies, one had to pay over 1,000 francs per year in tax, and be over the age of forty. The king would appoint peers to the Chamber of Peers on a hereditary basis, or for life at his discretion. Deputies would be elected every five years, with one fifth of them up for election each year. There were 90,000 citizens eligible to vote.|$|E

5|$|The {{events of}} the Darien Scheme, and the passing by the English Parliament of the Act of Settlement 1701 asserting {{the right to choose}} the order of {{succession}} for English, Scottish and Irish thrones, escalated political hostilities between England and Scotland, and neutralised calls for a united British people. The Parliament of Scotland responded by passing the Act of Security 1704, allowing it to appoint a different monarch to succeed to the Scottish crown from that of England, if it so wished. The English political perspective was that the appointment of a Jacobite monarchy in Scotland opened up the possibility of a Franco-Scottish military conquest of England during the Second Hundred Years' War and War of the Spanish Succession. The Parliament of England passed the Alien Act 1705, which provided that Scottish nationals in England were to be treated as aliens and estates held by Scots would be treated as alien property, whilst also restricting the import of Scottish products into England and its colonies (about half of Scotland's trade). However, the Act contained <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> it would be suspended if the Parliament of Scotland entered into negotiations regarding the creation of a unified Parliament of Great Britain, which in turn would refund Scottish financial losses on the Darien Scheme.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} of the broadcast, the Royal Rumble match, came next. For the first time, a {{stipulation}} was added that {{the winner of the}} match would receive a match for the WWF Championship at that year's WrestleMania (<b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> has remained since). The match began with two former WWF Champions, as Ric Flair and Bob Backlund entered the ring first. Every two minutes, one of the remaining twenty-eight contestants entered the match according to the number they drew prior to the event. Papa Shango was the third wrestler to enter but was thrown over the top rope and onto the arena floor by Ric Flair, causing Shango to be eliminated. Virgil entered sixth and immediately attacked Ted DiBiase because of their long-standing grudge. When Mr. Perfect entered in the number ten spot, he and Flair fought each other until Perfect eliminated Flair by performing a clothesline to knock Flair onto the floor. Virgil was eliminated by The Berzerker, while Perfect was thrown out of the ring by Jerry Lawler, Koko B. Ware, and Ted DiBiase.|$|E
5|$|The {{terms of}} the February 1922 Washington Naval Treaty forced the class' cancellation, but the two closest to {{completion}} (Amagi and Akagi) were saved from the scrappers by <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> allowed two capital ships to be converted to aircraft carriers. However, the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake caused significant stress damage to the hull of Amagi. The structure was too heavily damaged to be usable, and conversion work was abandoned. Amagi was struck from the navy list and sold for scrapping, which began on 14 April 1924. The other two ships, Atago and Takao, were officially cancelled two years later (31 July 1924) and were broken up for scrap in their slipways. Akagi went on as an aircraft carrier {{to fight in the}} Second World War, where it was sunk after air attack during the Battle of Midway.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{negotiating}} with the Tripolitanian envoy, Sivori {{was able to get}} an agreement restoring the diplomatic situation to as it had been prior to the events that had sparked the hostilities. In order to ensure that Karamanli would abide by the terms of the treaty, the Sardinians included <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> if the treaty were not ratified within four hours of its signing, Sardinian hostilities against Tripoli would recommence. Karamanli promptly acceded to the treaty upon receiving it and had the Sardinian consulate's national colors raised and saluted by his forces. The next day Sivori upon invitation arrived at Karamanli's palace, where he and his force were greeted with great respect and honor by the monarch. Though a stipulation was included in the peace treaty that required Sardinia to pay Tripoli 7,000 gold francs, it was canceled and as a result the long practice of Sardinian tributary payments to the Tripolitanians finally ended.|$|E
5|$|The {{first draft}} of the Z-4 Plan was {{prepared}} in September 1994, and further developed and amended on several occasions during the following four months. Over this period, International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia (ICFY) co-chairs David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg requested amendments to the plan and opposed its presentation to Croatian or RSK authorities. The first set of changes requested was to include <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> Croatia cede territory around the city of Županja (on the north bank of the Sava River) to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, allowing better communication between Belgrade and the Bosnian Serb territory around Banja Luka. The request, submitted on 8 September, was turned down by the plan authors. That day, Owen requested that the plan allow Krajina to form a confederation with either Serbia or FR Yugoslavia. Owen and Stoltenberg sought to create a network of confederations between the former Yugoslav republics, but {{the authors of the}} Z-4 Plan deemed that impossible. German foreign minister Klaus Kinkel, on behalf of the German EU presidency, cautioned Owen that Krajina Serbs formed only 5 percent of Croatia's population and a confederation between Kosovo and Albania would be more natural. On 6 October Russia declared its opposition to the confederation, but Owen regained the country's support for the idea four days later (shortly before it was abandoned).|$|E
