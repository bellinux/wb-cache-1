A phonological priming task was presented visually and auditorily, and speech onset latency (SOL) values were obtained for both participant groups. The results showed the following: (1) the ST group and the NST group {{did not differ in}} the number of incorrect responses to the visual and auditory stimuli, (2) the ST participants had significantly longer visual SOL values than the NST participants, but their auditory SOL values were comparable to those produced by the NST group, (3) both groups had significantly longer auditory than visual SOL values, (4) the ST group produced significantly longer visual SOL values than the NST group in all three priming conditions, and they produced significantly longer auditory SOL values in the C- and CV-homogenous, but not heterogeneous condition, (5) the priming effect was more pronounced in the NST group than for the ST group in both modalities, and (6) there were no significant correlations between stuttering severity and speech onset latency.

Limbic and auditory brain areas are thought to interact at the thalamic level. While a tinnitus signal originates from lesion-induced plasticity of the auditory pathways, it can be tuned out by feedback connections from limbic regions, which block the tinnitus signal from reaching auditory cortex.

40|$|Since its {{original}} description {{the diagnosis of}} word deafness has been greatly expanded. Confusion has arisen {{with regard to the}} usage of the related terms pure word deafness, auditory agnosia, and cortical deafness. Three new cases of word deafness are presented including one case with CT and necropsy correlation. These cases are compared with 34 previously reported cases of various cortical auditory disorders. Our review establishes that patients with word deafness who have had formal testing of linguistic and non-linguistic sound comprehension and musical abilities always demonstrated a more pervasive auditory agnosia. Despite the spectrum of auditory deficits and associated language abnormalities, patients with word deafness share common features including aetiology, pathology, clinical presentation and course. These common features justify inclusion of heterogeneous cortical auditory disorders under the rubric of word deafness. Despite some limitations the term "word deafness" should be retained for this syndrome, since inability to comprehend spoken words is the most distinctive clinical deficit. Word deafness is most frequently caused by cerebrovascular accidents of presumed cardiac embolisation, with bitemporal cortico-subcortical lesions. The sequence of cerebral injury is not predictive of resulting auditory deficits. Impairment of musical abilities parallels the severity of the <b>auditory</b> <b>disorder...</b>|$|E

Method: Thirty participants with SLI aged 6 years were selected, along with 30 age- and gender-matched participants with typical language development. The Adaptive Test of Temporal Resolution (ATTR) was used to evaluate temporal resolution ability (an aspect of temporal processing), and the digit span subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children was used to evaluate auditory short-term memory and working memory. Results: The analysis of covariance showed that children with SLI performed significantly worse than children with typical language development on the temporal resolution task (ATTR), even when controlling for short-term memory and working memory. Statistically significant correlations between ATTR and digit span were found for the group of children with SLI but not for the children with typical language development.

40|$|Tinnitus is an <b>auditory</b> <b>disorder,</b> {{which affects}} {{millions}} of Americans, including active duty service members and veterans. It is manifested by a phantom sound that is commonly restricted {{to a specific}} frequency range. Because tinnitus is associated with hearing deficits, understanding how tinnitus affects hearing perception is important for guiding therapies {{to improve the quality}} of life in this vast group of patients. In a rodent model of tinnitus, prolonged exposure to a tone leads to a selective decrease in gap detection in specific frequency bands. However, whether and how hearing acuity is affected for sounds within and outside those frequency bands is not well understood. We induced tinnitus in mice by prolonged exposure to a loud mid-range tone, and behaviorally assayed whether mice exhibited a change in frequency discrimination acuity for tones embedded within the mid-frequency range and high-frequency range at 1, 4, and 8 weeks post-exposure. A subset of tone-exposed mice exhibited tinnitus-like symptoms, as demonstrated by selective deficits in gap detection, which were restricted to the high frequency range. These mice exhibited impaired frequency discrimination both for tones in the mid-frequency range and high-frequency range. The remaining tone exposed mice, which did not demonstrate behavioral evidence of tinnitus, showed temporary deficits in frequency discrimination for tones in the mid-frequency range, while control mice remained unimpaired. Our findings reveal that the high frequency-specific deficits in gap detection, indicative of tinnitus, are associated with impairments in frequency discrimination at the frequency of the presumed tinnitus...|$|E

40|$|Hyperacusis is a {{frequent}} <b>auditory</b> <b>disorder</b> that is characterized by abnormal loudness perception where sounds of relatively normal volume are perceived as too loud or even painfully loud. As Hyperacusis patients show decreased loudness discomfort levels (LDLs) and steeper loudness growth functions, it has been hypothesized that hyperacusis might be caused {{by an increase in}} neuronal response gain in the auditory system. Moreover, since about 85 % of hyperacusis patients also experience tinnitus, the conditions might be caused by a common mechanism. However, the mechanisms that give rise to hyperacusis have remained unclear. Here we have used a computational model of the auditory system to investigate candidate mechanisms for hyperacusis. Assuming that perceived loudness is proportional to the summed activity of all auditory nerve fibers, the model was tuned to reproduce normal loudness perception. We then evaluated a variety of potential hyperacusis gain mechanisms by determining their effects on model equal-loudness contours and comparing the results to the LDLs of hyperacusis patients with normal hearing thresholds. Hyperacusis was best accounted for by an increase in nonlinear gain in the central auditory system. Good fits to the average patient LDLs were obtained for a general increase in gain that affected all frequency channels to the same degree, and also for a frequency-specific gain increase in the high-frequency range. Moreover, the gain needed to be applied after subtraction of spontaneous activity of the auditory nerve, which is in contrast to current theories of tinnitus generation based on amplification of spontaneous activity. Hyperacusis and tinnitus might therefore be caused by different changes in neuronal processing in the central auditory system...|$|E

The present study investigated the relation between these two factors. Three models of caffeine action were postulated, implicating cyclic 3 ' 5 '-AMP, adenosine, glucose, adenine and hypoxia. It was predicted that the stimulatory action of caffeine would increase or vary the sensation of tinnitus resulting from excitation anywhere within the auditory system. Sixteen subjects with unilateral versus bilateral or head tinnitus were randomly administered a placebo, 100 mg or 300 mg of caffeine using a double-blind procedure. Pitch matches to a tone, thresholds of sensitivity, loudness matches to a tone at the matched tinnitus frequency and to broadband noise, and the subjective ratings of tinnitus frequency and loudness were recorded prior to, and 30 or 60 minutes after oral ingestion of caffeine. Caffeine did not affect the pitch of tinnitus or tone threshold but noise thresholds were elevated after 100 mg but not 300 mg of caffeine and loudness matches to noise increased after both 100 mg and 300 mg of caffeine. Changes in loudness matches to a tone and subjective ratings of loudness were dose- and time-dependent. The results were discussed in relation to the proposed models and mechanisms of action. Results suggest that for certain tinnitus sufferers caffeine has a stimulatory effect and that the cessation of caffeine-containing beverages would eliminate gross increases or variations in tinnitus. For others, however, the results suggest a depressant action, raising the possibility of using caffeine as a therapeutic, management technique...|$|E

As a result, protection against auditory disorders seems to be necessary. Method: In accordance with the importance of this idea, a number of researches in the field of nutrition which resulted in finding the relation between NIHL and vitamins have been carried out. Through the assessment the fact that vitamins can have both preventative and curing influence on NIHL has been evident. Furthermore, it has been discovered that the deficiency of above-mentioned instances can in a way increase the sensitivity of auditory system to noise. Result: There are various mechanisms for NIHL, and each vitamin in a way can go against the destructive affection of it (NIHL). For instance, vitamins A,C and E along with Magnesium can wipe out the free radicals produced by noise exposure. Making use of Antioxidants combinations like vitamin E can prevent auditory cells from death and Noise Induced Hearing Loss from coming about.

40|$|Tinnitus is {{a common}} <b>auditory</b> <b>disorder</b> {{characterized}} by a chronic ringing or buzzing “in the ear. ”Despite the auditory-perceptual nature of this disorder, {{a growing number of}} studies have reported neuroanatomical differences in tinnitus patients outside the auditory-perceptual system. Some have used this evidence to characterize chronic tinnitus as dysregulation of the auditory system, either resulting from inefficient inhibitory control or through the formation of aversive associations with tinnitus. It remains unclear, however, whether these “non-auditory” anatomical markers of tinnitus are related to the tinnitus signal itself, or merely to negative emotional reactions to tinnitus (i. e., tinnitus distress). In the current study, we used anatomical MRI to identify neural markers of tinnitus, and measured their relationship to a variety of tinnitus characteristics and other factors often linked to tinnitus, such as hearing loss, depression, anxiety, and noise sensitivity. In a new cohort of participants, we confirmed that people with chronic tinnitus exhibit reduced gray matter in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) compared to controls matched for age and hearing loss. This effect was driven by reduced cortical surface area, and was not related to tinnitus distress, symptoms of depression or anxiety, noise sensitivity, or other factors. Instead, tinnitus distress was positively correlated with cortical thickness in the anterior insula in tinnitus patients, while symptoms of anxiety and depression were negatively correlated with cortical thickness in subcallosal anterior cingulate cortex (scACC) across all groups. Tinnitus patients also exhibited increased gyrification of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), which was more severe in those patients with constant (vs. intermittent) tinnitus awareness.

There is {{a high degree of}} co-morbidity between hyperacusis and tinnitus, most hyperacusis patients also have tinnitus, but only about 30 - 40 % of tinnitus patients also show symptoms of hyperacusis. In order to elucidate the mechanisms of hyperacusis, detailed measurements of loudness discomfort levels (LDLs) across the hearing range would be desirable. However, previous studies have only reported LDLs for a restricted frequency range, e. g. from 0. 5 to 4 kHz, or from 1 to 8 kHz. We have measured audiograms and LDLs in 381 patients with a primary complaint of hyperacusis for the full standard audiometric frequency range from 0. 125 to 8 kHz. On average, patients had mild high-frequency hearing loss, but {{more than a third of}} the tested ears had normal hearing thresholds, i. e. ≤ 20 dB HL. LDLs were found to be significantly decreased compared to a normal-hearing reference group, with average values around 85 dB HL across the frequency range. However, receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that LDL measurements are neither sensitive nor specific enough to serve as a single test for hyperacusis. There was a moderate positive correlation between hearing thresholds and LDLs (r = 0. 36), i. e. LDLs tended to be higher at frequencies where hearing loss was present, suggesting that hyperacusis is unlikely to be caused by hearing threshold increase, in contrast to tinnitus for which hearing loss is a main trigger. Moreover, our finding that LDLs are decreased across the full range of audiometric frequencies, regardless of the pattern or degree of hearing loss, indicates that hyperacusis might be due to a generalized increase in auditory gain. Tinnitus on the other hand is thought to be caused by neuroplastic changes in a restricted frequency range, suggesting that tinnitus and hyperacusis might not share a common mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Topography of {{auditory}} evoked cortical potentials {{in children}} with severelanguage impairmentIngerTonnquist-UhlenDepartment of Audiology, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, SwedenDevelopment of normal speech and language functions {{is closely related to}} normal hearing. However, most children with delayed or disturbed speech development show normal tone thresh-olds and here the investigation has to include higher levels in the auditory system. There isevidence for a connection between language impairment and a central auditory processingdisorder, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. There is also a need forobjective diagnostic methods of central auditory function. In the present study, a computerised method of mapping the scalp topography of long-latency (cortical) auditory evoked potentials (LAEP) was used for assessment of the functionin central auditory pathways. Topographic mapping of the LAEP component N I, in adultsand normal children, showed reproducible and valid results. In adults, a focal negativity,focus of NI (FNI), with a frontocentral position and contralateral to the stimulated earwas observed. The N I maps in normal children showed a pattern similar to that in adults,but with some age-related changes. The Nl latencies declined significantly with age innormal children and reached adult values at the ages of 14 - 16 years. The topography of the LAEP components N I, P 2, N 2 and the T complex was investi-gated in 20 children with severe language impairment (LI). The study also included audi-tory brainstem responses (ABR), electroencephalography (EEG), quantitative EEG (qEEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Twenty normal children served as controls (C). A similar topographic pattern was found in the LI and the C children, but with a higherproportion of deviating and non-focal maps in the LI group. The latencies of all componentswere significantly longer in the LI than in the C children. The diagnostic value of LAEP topog-raphy, latency and amplitude was estimated with a scoring system, whereby significantlyhigher scores were found in the LI group than in the C group. With all three parameterstogether the sensitivity was 65 %, with a specificity of 90 %. There was a high degree of pathological EEGs in the LI group. ABR abnormalities were seenin some LI subjects. MRI was normal in all but two LI children. There was no significantcorrelation between the results of EEG,ABR, MRI and the total score of LAEP, but someLI children showed a wide pathological pattern. In 17 of the 20 LI subjects a pathologi-cal result was obtained in {{one or more of the}} investigations. In conclusion, our results may indicate that language impairment has a dualpathophysiology, a specific <b>auditory</b> <b>disorder</b> (LAEP, ABR) and a non-specific generalcerebral disturbance (EEG, MRI). The highly varying results among the present LI chil-dren, with specific and/or non-specific deviations, may be due to heterogeneity of thegroup with different aetiologies of their language impairment, or to a general develop-mental disturbance with a varying distribution and penetrance. The scoring systern ofLAEP proved to be the most sensitive method in separating the LI children from thecontrols. This may be a promising model for individual diagnostic criteria and for clas-sification of language impairment.
