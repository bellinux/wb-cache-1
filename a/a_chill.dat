5|$|The scenes {{featuring}} Berry in {{a bikini}} were shot in Cádiz. The location was reportedly cold and windy, and footage {{has been released}} of Berry wrapped in thick towels between takes to avoid catching <b>a</b> <b>chill.</b> Berry was injured during filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye. The debris was removed in a 30-minute operation.|$|E
5|$|Contrasting against Caravaggio's sensual {{baskets of}} fruit, Chardin's plush peaches, or Cézanne's vibrant {{arrangements}} of apples, the mundane Campbell's Soup Cans gave {{the art world}} <b>a</b> <b>chill.</b> Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous enough to the art world that both the merits and ethics of the work were perfectly reasonable debate topics {{for those who had}} not even seen the piece. Warhol's pop art {{can be seen as a}} relation to Minimal art in the sense that it attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.|$|E
5|$|Hornung {{finished}} {{his work with}} the YMCA and returned to England probably in early 1919, according to Rowland. He worked on a new novel but was hampered by poor health. His wife's health was of even greater concern, so in February 1921 they took a holiday {{in the south of}} France to recuperate. He fell ill on the train with <b>a</b> <b>chill</b> that turned into influenza and pneumonia from which he died on 22 March 1921, aged 54. He was buried in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, in the south of France, in a grave adjacent to that of George Gissing. Doyle, returning from a spiritualist lecture tour of Australia, received the news in Paris and travelled south in time for the funeral.|$|E

5000|$|In a legal context, <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> {{effect is}} the {{inhibition}} or discouragement of the legitimate exercise {{of natural and}} legal rights {{by the threat of}} legal sanction. The right that is most often described as being suppressed by <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> effect is the US constitutional right to free speech. <b>A</b> <b>chilling</b> effect may be caused by legal actions such as the passing of a law, the decision of a court, or the threat of a lawsuit; any legal action that would cause people to hesitate to exercise a legitimate right (freedom of speech or otherwise) for fear of legal repercussions. When that fear is brought about by the threat of a libel lawsuit, it is called libel <b>chill.</b> <b>A</b> lawsuit initiated specifically for the purpose of creating <b>a</b> <b>chilling</b> effect may be called a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation, or more commonly, a [...] "SLAPP suit".|$|R

40|$|In cities {{located in}} the {{subtropical}} regions, air-cooled chillers are commonly used to cool commercial buildings almost year-round, which accounts for considerable electricity consumption in the long term. This paper explains how <b>a</b> <b>chiller</b> plant should be designed to enable the chillers to operate frequently with maximum performance. Four design options {{with respect to the}} number and size of chillers were studied for <b>a</b> <b>chiller</b> plant satisfying the year-round cooling demand of a hotel. For each design option, the annual electricity consumption of chillers and pumps was assessed using <b>a</b> sophisticated <b>chiller</b> model. The assessment showed that an electricity saving of 10. 1 % can be achieved by installing <b>a</b> <b>chiller</b> plant with six chillers of three different sizes instead of four equally sized chillers. The results of this paper will give engineers and researchers a better idea about how to select chillers of different sizes and how chiller part load performance curves can be used to evaluate improvements in the energy performance of <b>a</b> <b>chiller</b> plant with alternative designs.

25|$|In mid-1933 Blair left Hawthorns {{to become}} a teacher at Frays College, in Uxbridge, Middlesex. This was a much larger {{establishment}} with 200 pupils and {{a full complement of}} staff. He acquired a motorcycle and took trips through the surrounding countryside. On one of these expeditions he became soaked and caught <b>a</b> <b>chill</b> that developed into pneumonia. He was taken to Uxbridge Cottage Hospital, where for a time his life was believed to be in danger. When he was discharged in January 1934, he returned to Southwold to convalesce and, supported by his parents, never returned to teaching.|$|E

The batsman Eric Russell and fast bowler Dave Brown were suffering from injuries and Ken Higgs had <b>a</b> <b>chill.</b> The Welsh left-arm fast bowler Jeff Jones was called up, as was the Essex all rounder Barry Knight flown out as a replacement just before the First Test. Simpson won the toss and batted on a good wicket.|$|E

Reluctantly, Ahab orders the harpooneers {{to inspect the}} casks. Queequeg, sweating all day below decks, develops <b>a</b> <b>chill</b> and soon is almost mortally feverish. The carpenter makes a coffin for Queequeg, who fears an ordinary burial at sea. Queequeg tries it for size, with Pip sobbing and beating his tambourine, standing by and calling himself a coward while he praises Queequeg for his gameness. Yet Queequeg suddenly rallies, briefly convalesces, and leaps up, back in good health. Henceforth, he uses his coffin for a spare seachest, which is later caulked and pitched to replace the Pequods life buoy.|$|E

25|$|US and Soviet {{experiments}} {{had also}} given off similar neutron bursts at temperatures {{that were not}} high enough for fusion. This led Lyman Spitzer to express his scepticism of the results, but his comments were dismissed by UK observers as jingoism. Further experiments on ZETA showed that the original temperature measurements were misleading; the bulk temperature was too low for fusion reactions to create the number of neutrons being seen. The claim that ZETA had produced fusion had to be publicly withdrawn, an embarrassing event that cast <b>a</b> <b>chill</b> over the entire fusion establishment. The neutrons were later explained as being the product of instabilities in the fuel. These instabilities appeared inherent to any similar design, {{and work on the}} basic pinch concept as a road to fusion power ended by 1961.|$|E
25|$|Thereafter, {{the couple}} spent half {{their time in}} New Mills, {{and the other half}} in Calder Grove. Mackie paid for a new school at nearby Painthorpe, {{completed}} in 1875. In Derbyshire in the same year he became chairman of the New Mill School Board, and later on was a council representative for New Mills and an alderman on Derbyshire County Council. Back in Crigglestone in 1885, Mackie became chairman of the Liberal Association. While at Calder Grove, he served as a Sunday school teacher, was at one time a delegate to the Diocesan conference, and in 1899 was elected Wakefield YMCA's president. He died unexpectedly at the age of 54 after catching <b>a</b> <b>chill</b> at his and Mary's 25th wedding anniversary celebrations at Crigglestone. He was given a big funeral and buried in Derbyshire. A granite drinking fountain was erected at New Mills in his memory.|$|E
25|$|The young polemicist persevered in {{supporting}} this anti-establishment cause, moving on from L'Indépendance Roumaine {{to the newly}} established publication România Jună, interrupting himself for trips to Italy, the Netherlands and Galicia-Lodomeria. In 1900, he collected the scattered polemical articles into the French-language books Opinions sincères. La vie intellectuelle des roumains en 1899 ("Honest Opinions. The Romanians' Intellectual Life in 1899") and Opinions pérnicieuses d'un mauvais patriote ("The Pernicious Opinions of a Bad Patriot"). His scholarly activities resulted in a second trip into Transylvania, a second portion of his Bistrița archives collection, the 11th Hurmuzachi volume, and two works on early modern Romanian history: Acte din secolul al XVI-lea relative la Petru Șchiopul ("16th Century Acts Relating to Peter the Lame") and Scurtă istorie a lui Mihai Viteazul ("A Short History of Michael the Brave"). His controversial public attitude had nevertheless attracted an official ban on his Academy reports, and also meant that he was ruled out from the national Academy prize (for which distinction he had submitted Documente românești din arhivele Bistriței). The period also witnessed <b>a</b> <b>chill</b> in the Iorga's relationship with Xenopol.|$|E
