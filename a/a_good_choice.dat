5|$|As Shadow Chancellor, Brown as Chancellor-in-waiting {{was seen}} as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>choice</b> by {{business}} and the middle class. While he was Chancellor inflation sometimes exceeded the 2% target causing the Governor of the Bank of England to write several letters to the Chancellor, each time inflation exceeded three per cent.|$|E
5|$|Seidler thought Paul Bettany {{would be}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>choice</b> to play King GeorgeVI, Tom Hooper {{preferred}} Hugh Grant, though both actors refused the offer. Once {{they met with}} Firth and heard him read for the part, Seidler and Hooper were convinced of his suitability for the role.|$|E
5|$|Because of its durability, {{titanium}} {{has become}} more popular for designer jewelry (particularly, titanium rings). Its inertness makes it <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>choice</b> for those with allergies or those who will be wearing the jewelry in environments such as swimming pools. Titanium is also alloyed with gold to produce an alloy that can be marketed as 24-carat gold because the 1% of alloyed Ti is insufficient to require a lesser mark. The resulting alloy is roughly the hardness of 14-carat gold and is more durable than pure 24-carat gold.|$|E

5|$|Common {{onions are}} {{normally}} available in three colour varieties. Yellow or brown onions (called red in some European countries), are full-flavoured {{and are the}} onions of choice for everyday use. Yellow onions turn a rich, dark brown when caramelised and give French onion soup its sweet flavour. The red onion (called purple in some European countries) is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>choice</b> for fresh use when its colour livens up the dish; it is also used in grilling. White onions are the traditional onions used in classic Mexican cuisine; they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sautéed.|$|E
5|$|Red maple is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>choice</b> of a {{tree for}} urban areas when there is ample room for its root system. Forming an {{association}} with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi can help A. rubrum grow along city streets. It is more tolerant of pollution and road salt than Sugar Maples, although the tree's fall foliage is not as vibrant in this environment. Like several other maples, its low root system can be invasive {{and it makes a}} poor choice for plantings near paving. It attracts squirrels, who eat its buds in the early spring, although squirrels prefer the larger buds of the silver maple.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu {{praised the}} idea of making a game based around trials, which they found to be innovative, and found it exhilarating and fun to uncover witnesses' lies. Thomas Bowskill at Nintendo Life said that the game had changed his idea of what can make for a great game, and called it a masterpiece. Carrie Gouskos at GameSpot said that the game revitalized the {{adventure}} game genre. Michael Cole at Nintendo World Report said that the game's design and interface would make it <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>choice</b> for non-gamers as well. Bowskill called the investigation sections tedious and boring at times, but said that they were outweighed by the feeling of accomplishment from solving the cases. Craig Harris at IGN felt that the main issues with the game were its linearity, and how the puzzles are simple because of how the player can stop a witness testimony at any time. Cole, too, felt that the game was very linear, and that it was unclear how to proceed at certain points. He said that, because of how story-driven it is, the game has low replay value; he still felt that players might want to replay it after a few years.|$|E

Moreover, perceived opportunities in the country for the entrepreneur, entrepreneurship as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> career <b>choice</b> is the most affecting variables to measure the quality of the EC environment as opposed to fear of failure rate in the entrepreneurs’ mindset.|$|R

5|$|With the war underway, Hancock {{made his}} way to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia with the other Massachusetts delegates. On May 24, 1775, he was {{unanimously}} elected President of the Continental Congress, succeeding Peyton Randolph after Henry Middleton declined the nomination. Hancock was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>choice</b> for president for several reasons. He was experienced, having often presided over legislative bodies and town meetings in Massachusetts. His wealth and social standing inspired the confidence of moderate delegates, while his association with Boston radicals made him acceptable to other radicals. His position was somewhat ambiguous, because the role of the president was not fully defined, and it was not clear if Randolph had resigned or was on a leave of absence. Like other presidents of Congress, Hancock's authority was mostly limited to that of a presiding officer. He also had to handle a great deal of official correspondence, and he found it necessary to hire clerks at his own expense to help with the paperwork.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Eragon {{continues}} his training, but is discouraged when the {{scar on his}} back causes him to have agonizing seizures multiple times per day. He has been swooning over Arya {{for most of the}} book. Saphira also has a similar problem with Glaedr, as she believes him to be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>choice</b> for a mate and tries to win his affections. Eragon tells her it would not be proper, and she in turn replies that Arya is not as important as his education. Both efforts fail miserably, but bring Eragon and Saphira closer together. Later, at the ancient elven ceremony, the Agaetí Blödhren (Blood-Oath Celebration), Eragon is altered by a spectral dragon. The changes alter his senses, and enhance his abilities, effectively turning him into an elf-human hybrid, as well as healing all of his wounds, scars, and back injury. Reinvigorated, Eragon continues training until he learns that the Empire will soon attack the Varden in Surda. Afterward he confesses his feelings for Arya who rejects him harshly. Dismayed, he leaves without completing his training, to aid the Varden in battle. Upon leaving he is given a bow with magical arrows, a belt with twelve priceless diamonds, an enchanted flask of elvish concoction, a copy of a poem he wrote and presented for the Agaetí Blödhren, and the blessing of Oromis and Glaedr.|$|E
5|$|The {{activation}} of the French First Army left Seventh Army with only one corps. Devers asked for IV Corps to be transferred from Italy, but Wilson argued that this would adversely affect operations in Italy against the Gothic Line, and the Combined Chiefs agreed. Instead, Devers proposed on 26 September that Major General Wade H. Haislip's XV Corps to be transferred from Patton's Third Army, which had severe logistical difficulties, to the Seventh Army. Devers argued that they could better be supported over the 6th Army Group's line of communications from the Mediterranean. Eisenhower agreed, and further ordered that three more divisions scheduled to join Bradley's 12th Army Group in northern France, but unlikely to do so until the supply and transport situation improved, be diverted to Marseilles, and join the 6th Army Group. Haislip was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>choice</b> for the 6th Army Group. He spoke French fluently, having fought in France during World War I and attended the Ecole Superieure de Guerre from 1925 to 1927, and was attuned to French sensibilities. Above all, Haislip got along well with Major General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, the mercurial commander of the French 2nd Armored Division. Devers was shocked when Leclerc informed him {{that he and his}} men wanted to serve with the American Army, not the French First Army, which he considered dominated by Vichy French traitors.|$|E

25|$|While {{the above}} {{approach}} is technically correct, Devroye notes {{that it is}} linear {{in the value of}} k and in general is not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>choice.</b> Instead he recommends using either rejection-based or table-based methods, depending on context.|$|E
25|$|The needle gun has {{advantages}} over other scaling tools. Its main {{advantage is that}} the needles automatically adjust themselves to contours, making the tool <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>choice</b> for cleaning irregular surfaces.

25|$|Today {{there are}} only a few Rottalers left, but about 20 breeders in Bavaria are {{actively}} preserving the breed and the breed receives federal support. Rottalers are similar to the other heavy warmbloods in type, though due to consistent use of Arab blood, they have more refined heads. They are excellent all-purpose ride-and-drive horses, with sufficient talent in dressage and jumping. They are promoted as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>choice</b> for vaulting horses.|$|E
25|$|Leaking gutters and downspouts {{can cause}} serious {{damage to a}} building's {{interior}} and exterior.

Gutters and downspouts made with copper are expected to outlast other metal materials and plastics. Even in corrosion-prone seacoast environments or in areas with acid rain or smog, copper gutters and downspouts can provide 50 years or more of service.|$|E

25|$|The {{seeds of}} other poppy types are not eaten, {{but they are}} {{cultivated}} for the flowers they produce. Annual and biennial poppies are considered <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>choice</b> to cultivate from seed as they are not difficult to propagate by this method, and can be put directly in the ground during January. The California poppy (Eschscholzia californica), for example, is a striking orange wildflower that grows in the Western and Northwestern United States.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance is extremely useful for analyzing samples non-destructively. Radio waves and static magnetic fields easily penetrate {{many types of}} matter and anything that is not inherently ferromagnetic. For example, various expensive biological samples, such as nucleic acids, including RNA and DNA, or proteins, can be studied using nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} for weeks or months before using destructive biochemical experiments. This also makes nuclear magnetic resonance <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>choice</b> for analyzing dangerous samples.|$|E
25|$|Due to his {{advanced}} age, Augustus {{was unable}} {{to travel to the}} east himself. There were few the Emperor trusted to settle matters in the east, but he was confident Gaius could. Gaius made <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>choice,</b> because his presence represented that of the imperial family - all orders, promises, or threats coming from him were as valid as if they came from the Emperor himself. Nonetheless, he was only eighteen, and therefore too young for the conduct of important business.|$|E
