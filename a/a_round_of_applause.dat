5|$|A {{local radio}} show {{schedules}} {{an interview with}} Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to discuss Dunder Mifflin, but, unbeknown to Dwight, the interview is later canceled. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) suggests they all use this to their advantage, and stage an interview for Dwight's benefit. Dwight believes he is talking to the interviewer through {{the phone in the}} break room, but is actually talking to Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) who is using an American accent. They convince him that the information he is giving leads to a hostage situation with CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) cornered in his house. Dwight calls David and tries to talk him into surrendering to the police. David is confused but nonetheless responds in a way that leads Dwight to believe he was successful. He emerges from the break room and is greeted by <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> from his coworkers.|$|E
5|$|In 2013–14, Lin was {{replaced}} in the Rockets' starting lineup by Patrick Beverley, and Lin became the second unit's primary ball handler and scoring option as the team's sixth man. Houston liked beginning games with Beverley's defensive pressure, but also preferred increasing Lin's playing time without Harden {{also on the}} court. Lin and Harden were both attacking players offensively, but each struggled defensively. In November, Lin established the highest two-game scoring total of his career, 65 points, including season-highs of 34 points and 11 assists along with a Rockets record-tying nine three-pointers in a start in place of an injured Harden. It {{was followed by a}} 21-point performance in a win at New York. He received <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> upon entering the game, though it was more subdued than in his first return against the Knicks. On November 27, Lin sprained his right knee against the Atlanta Hawks, causing him to miss six games. He missed four additional games in December due to back spasms; he started in his return on December 23 with both Harden and Beverley injured—Beverley was estimated to be out four to six weeks due to a fractured right hand. On February 1, 2014, Lin recorded 15 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists—his first career triple-double—in 29 minutes off the bench in a 106–92 home victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. He was the first Rocket to notch a triple-double off the bench since Cedric Maxwell in 1988. However, he went into a shooting slump after the All-Star break, and again experienced problems with his back.|$|E
25|$|On March 17, 2014, Canaan {{delivered}} her speech, “Islamophobia and Art”, {{about the}} need to combat anti-muslim prejudice artistically, at the 25th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council at the Palais des Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, gaining <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> and kudos.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} days, tributes {{were made for}} him at professional races, first at the Tour of Croatia {{the next day with}} a minute's silence, and then the Liège–Bastogne–Liège the day after with <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause.</b> In both races riders wore black armbands. Alejandro Valverde won Liège–Bastogne–Liège and gave his prize money to Scarponi's family. Former teammate and close friend Vincenzo Nibali dedicated his overall victory of the Tour of Croatia to Scarponi. A minute's silence was also observed before the Juventus–Genoa Serie A football match in Turin. His funeral took place on 25 April at Filottrano's football stadium, attended by an estimated 5,000 mourners. The service was officiated by cardinal Edoardo Menichelli.|$|E
25|$|The Top 3, Sophie, Bill and Fenton {{had just}} two final {{challenges}} to complete. The {{first was the}} last chance {{to work on their}} presenting skills with Mark and Julia. Mark held a Cue card which they were required to read while looking down the camera and deliver it with as much personality as possible. Mark was looking for someone with the ability to engage the audience. Bill and Sophie struggled with their delivery while big Fenton nailed it in one take, getting <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> from both judges. Then it was off to one of Sydney's best fine dining experiences, Mint bar and dining. Once there they had one last attempt to impress 5 VIP's with a signature dish under the keen eye of Ben O'Donoghue. This showed another side of Ben that the contestants had yet to see, a no nonsense head chef barking orders at them in the kitchen and putting the pressure on to get the meals out as efficiently as possible. Sophie served up a very fresh and light Mexican chicken with a tasty salad including heart of palm and pistachio. The food critiques were very impressed. Next up Bill aimed to impress with his dish, crayfish cooked in herb butter and served with a salad. The reaction was the same all round from the judges, not good. The presentation was lacking and the salad didn't suit the dish. Owner of Mint remarked 'It's like two different dishes on one plate.' Finally Fenton from Queensland served up an eye fillet with hollandaise and potato rösti (a favourite at his restaurant.) While one judge thought the beef was the best stating 'he (Fenton) put his whole life on the BBQ and served it up for us.' it was Sophie's chicken that got the majority of the VIP judges vote and won her ticket through to the grand finale. That left Fenton and Bill. Ben then announced that Bill would be going home and Fenton was going through. But then in a final twist, Chef Ben O'Donoghue decided to bring Bill back because he felt that he had let him down with his direction in the kitchen. So the Top 2 was again the Top 3 with all contestants going into the final with the winner announced on Australia Day.|$|E
500|$|The {{next morning}} {{is the first}} with Frank Burns in charge, and he {{immediately}} starts using his [...] "gung-ho", militarily strict, and whistle-happy attitude to assemble the company. A lack of respect from his subordinates is already evident, as an out of uniform and unshaven Hawkeye and Trapper and an outrageously dressed (even for him) Corporal Klinger (Jamie Farr) {{show up for the}} assembly. As Blake leaves his tent for the last time, dressed in his new suit, he is greeted with <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> from the unit. Frank and Margaret give Blake a formal [...] "ten-hut" [...] salute. Henry, in his typical laid-back fashion, tells Frank to [...] "take it easy" [...] and to [...] "stuff that whistle someplace".|$|E
6000|$|... "He-ar, he-ar!" [...] {{burst from}} the toady {{in spite of his}} recent rebuke; but as it was drowned in <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> hearty <b>applause</b> no one was the wiser or the worse of his note of approval.|$|R
5000|$|... "First-time caller (Bob!)": When callers {{identify}} themselves as first-time callers, Bob and Sheri give them <b>a</b> small <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause.</b> Bob sometimes acts irritated at having to do this every time...he once complained about it and his protest only encouraged listeners to say it more.|$|R
50|$|The third {{subsection}} was {{the collection}} of various instruments into a musical ensemble, despite the unclear sound of the liras and the somewhat unblended voices.

500|$|Inherit the Wind {{began an}} {{enduring}} collaboration between Stanley Kramer and Tracy—Kramer directed Tracy's three final films. Judgment at Nuremberg, released {{at the end}} of 1961, was their second feature together. [...] The film depicts the [...] "Judges' Trial", the trial of Nazi judges for their role in the Holocaust. Abby Mann wrote the role of Judge Haywood with Tracy in mind; Tracy called it the best script he had ever read. At the end of the film, Tracy delivered a 13-minute speech. He recorded it in one take, and received <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> from the cast and crew. Upon seeing the film, Mann wrote to Tracy: [...] "Every writer ought to have the experience of having Spencer Tracy do his lines. There is nothing in the world quite like it." [...] The film met with positive reviews and a large audience; Tracy received an eighth Oscar nomination for his performance.|$|E
500|$|Chris Carter, {{when talking}} about [...] "Redux" [...] and [...] "Redux II", noted that he [...] "wanted to tie {{up a lot of}} loose ends from the past season, and play the idea that the {{conspiracy}} is a hoax and that it had been done to hide various terrestrial and temporal misdeeds". Despite being the season premiere, [...] "Redux" [...] was the second episode produced of the season due to David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson being needed for filming on The X-Files movie. In [...] "Redux II", the role of [...] "Quiet Willy" [...] was originally intended for the character the [...] "Gray-Haired Man", but was re-written for a new character when actor Morris Panych was unavailable. The role went to Willy Ross, whose real name is Steve Allen. The tagline for [...] "Redux" [...] is changed to [...] "All Lies Lead to the Truth". Director R. W. Goodwin has said that the crew filming [...] "Redux" [...] were so impressed by actor John Finn's monologue detailing the supposed military hoax that he received <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> after finishing his takes. The script for this speech was particularly long, with Goodwin comparing it to [...] "the Yellow Pages".|$|E
500|$|A {{reporter}} for the Daily Mail wrote that Rihanna displayed her competitive side during her performance on American Idol, after [...] "Lady Gaga set such high standards". Writing for About.com, Bill Lamb was critical of Rihanna's decision to perform [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] on American Idol. He commented that previous media reports had indicated that the singer would be debuting a different album track, [...] "Te Amo", which was later released as the sixth and final single from Rated R. Lamb thought that [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] {{was one of the}} [...] "weaker" [...] songs on the album, and predicted that it would be [...] "destined to end the streak of three consecutive top 10 pop hits from the album". While he wrote that the [...] "intensely chilly, distant feel of the song works" [...] within the context of Rated R, Lamb was unsure of whether or not it would appeal to the masses on radio. The song was included on the set list of the Last Girl on Earth Tour (2010–11). Clay Cane for BET wrote that Rihanna [...] "deserves <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> for doing something different, straying away from being a standard pop tart". [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] is also included on Rihanna's Diamonds World Tour (2013).|$|E

Ahead of their league game against Eibar at the Camp Nou (25 October 2015), Barcelona players showed their support for Cruyff by wearing orange T-shirts bearing the words 'Ànims Johan' (Catalan for 'Get well soon Johan'). Writing in his weekly De Telegraaf column, Cruyff admitted, “Often the media are an additional tax, but the last week that has been different. The way in which a reply is posted via a variety of media in my situation, was emotional and heartwarming. I am extremely proud of the appreciation shown by all responses.” On his condition, Cruyff added, “Meanwhile, we have to wait. It’s really annoying that it has been leaked so quickly, because the only thing I know now is that I have lung cancer. No more. Because the investigation is ongoing.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The evening {{following}} the traffic accident, Ol' Dirty Bastard rushed on-stage unexpectedly as Shawn Colvin {{took the stage}} to give her acceptance speech for Song of the Year at the 1998 Grammy Awards, and he announced he had recently purchased expensive clothes in anticipation of winning the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album that he lost to Puff Daddy. As Ol' Dirty Bastard took the stage to <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause,</b> he asked the audience, [...] "Please calm down, the music and everything. It's nice that I went and bought me an outfit today that costed {{a lot of money}} today, you know what I mean? 'Cause I figured that Wu-Tang was gonna win.
