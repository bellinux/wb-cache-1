50|$|Structures are {{typically}} {{based on a}} rectangular floor plan, and feature massive, symmetrical primary façades. Stuccoed walls, red tiled roofs, windows {{in the shape of}} arches or circles, one or two stories, wood or wrought iron balconies with window grilles, and <b>articulated</b> <b>door</b> surrounds are characteristic. Keystones were occasionally employed. Ornamentation may be simple or dramatic. Lush gardens often appear.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{features of the}} Devon GTX included an aircraft-quality carbon fiber body, “up and forward” <b>articulating</b> <b>doors,</b> two-tone wheel surrounds, minimal front/rear overhangs, dual center exhaust ports and carbon fiber racing seats.|$|R
5000|$|Doors: 1 door, 2 door or 3 doors (normal) or 2 doors, 3 doors or 4 <b>doors</b> (<b>articulated)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Transit buses can be single-decker, double-decker, rigid or articulated. Selection of type has {{traditionally}} been made on a regional as well as operational basis; however, {{with the advent of}} global manufacturing, all of these types {{can be seen in the}} same location or country. Depending on local policies, transit buses will also usually have two, three or (for <b>articulated)</b> four <b>doors</b> to facilitate rapid boarding and alighting.|$|R
50|$|Not {{only the}} {{community}} members were expert and specialized in stone cutting {{and construction of}} forts, palaces, temples and buildings {{but they were also}} skilled architects and artisans who could do <b>articulate</b> carvings of <b>doors,</b> windows, pillars, and statues of gods and goddesses and ceilings.|$|R
5000|$|For 2003, {{a number}} of changes and {{improvements}} {{were made to the}} Navigator thanks to a thorough redesign. The Navigator continued to share a platform with the Ford Expedition, which was also redesigned for 2003, but continued to differ from it in terms of styling and various upscale features. The 2003 redesign featured a thoroughly revised exterior, the first since the Navigator's launch, with only the front doors and roof panel unchanged from the previous generation. The new exterior came with things such as a larger chrome waterfall grille, brighter quad-beam headlights with larger housings, revised chrome door handles set in color-keyed bezels, and slightly wider running boards. Inside the Navigator was an all-new instrument panel and dashboard area which, significantly, was not shared with the Expedition. Inspired by the symmetrical, [...] "dual-cockpit" [...] layout of the 1961 Lincoln Continental, the instrument panel and dashboard area was adorned with real walnut burl wood inserts and panels and switches painted with a low-luster satin nickel color. Adding to the upscale interior design further were white LEDs, 120 in all, which provided backlighting for controls and switches. Additionally, to direct attention to the high-quality satin nickel-faced analog clock mounted in the dashboard, an <b>articulating</b> <b>door</b> is present to conceal the radio head unit and optional satellite navigation system when they are not in use.|$|R
50|$|The {{product range}} of Centroliner included: midibus, full-size/articulated single-decker, and three-axle double-decker, in {{different}} body lengths. The rigids had 1 door, 2 door or 3 <b>doors</b> whereas the <b>articulated</b> have 2 <b>doors,</b> 3 doors or 4 doors. After {{the acquisition of}} Neoplan by MAN AG subsidy MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG, {{a new version of}} Centroliner full-size/articulated single-decker was launched, it was also known as Neoplan Centroliner Evolution.|$|R
25|$|Due to its dual {{commercial}} and residential purpose, the building's facade design received a different treatment than those of most other homes of the time. Thus, in the first level, the neoclassical elements are austere; the exterior is <b>articulated</b> by the <b>doors</b> and windows openings. These openings are framed by moldings and pilasters resembling Tuscan columns. The pilasters are crowned by an unadorned, flat architrave that runs along the entire facade, clearly dividing the commercial first floor from the residential upper level. The second level received a more complex treatment, to emphasize its residential and, thus, social significance. The upper level facade is completely articulated around its many openings. There are 13 sets of wooden double doors with adjustable louvers, nine facing Calle Castillo and four overlooking Paseo Atocha. Each doorway is accentuated {{by a combination of}} balconies, plaster moldings and pediments, all framed by a rhythmic articulation of Corinthian pilasters. The balconies have the original 19th century wrought iron grilles. The facade is crowned with a sober, but strong entablature. The Tuscan and Corinthian pilaster accent the building verticality, against its massive and dominating horizontality.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Motion {{planning}} in high dimensional state spaces, such as for mobile manipulation, is a challenging problem. Constrained manipulation, e. g opening <b>articulated</b> objects like <b>doors</b> or drawers, is also hard since sampling {{states on the}} constrained manifold is expensive. Further, planning for such tasks requires a combination of {{planning in}} free space for reaching a desired grasp or contact location followed by planning for the constrained manipulation motion, often necessitating a slow two step process in traditional approaches. In this work, we show that combined planning for such tasks can be dramatically accelerated by providing user demonstrations of the constrained manipulation motions. In particular, we show how such demonstrations {{can be incorporated into}} a recently developed framework of planning with experience graphs which encode and reuse previous experiences. We focus on tasks involving articulation constraints, e. g. door opening or drawer opening, where the motion of the object itself involves only a single degree of freedom. We provide experimental results with the PR 2 robot opening a variety of such articulated objects using our approach, using full-body manipulation (after receiving kinesthetic demonstrations). We also provide simulated results highlighting the benefits of our approach for constrained manipulation tasks. I...|$|R
