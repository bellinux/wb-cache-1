Various instrumental methods (gas chromatography, high pressure liquid chromatography) and sensory analysis, in conjunction with statistical analysis, were developed and applied in an attempt to provide reliable answers to this issue. This research aimed at classifying 33 greek wines from various regions by employing both instrumental and sensory analysis. Application of principal component analysis (PCA) to our experimental data resulted in satisfactory classifications of only Greek red <b>wines</b> in terms <b>of</b> their geographical origin. creek wines were effectively distinguished in two or three groups (depending on PCA figure); wines from Aegean/Ionean islands.

40|$|M. Sc. The South African wine {{industry}} is well respected internationally for producing high quality <b>wines.</b> The possible <b>adulteration</b> <b>of</b> these <b>wines</b> {{can lead to}} loss of reputation {{and a loss of}} sales and could also be dangerous to consumer’s health. Multi-element analysis <b>of</b> <b>wines</b> is one way of implementing quality control and the same multi-element data {{can also be used to}} prove the point of origin. The metal content of the fruit (grapes) should represent the metal content of the soil in which the plants (vineyards) were grown. An Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) was used with correct internal standard and interference correction to obtain reliable concentrations for 27 elements (Li, B, Al, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Se, Rb, Sr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Cd, Sn, Sb, Ba, Ce, Nd, W, Tl, Pb and U) of 1 : 1 diluted wines and microwave digested vineyard soil from four South-African wine-producing regions: Stellenbosch, Swartland, Robertson and Walker Bay. This multi-element data was then interpreted using multivariate statistical analysis in order to determine which elements have the ability to discriminate between the four regions. Li, B, Sc, Ni, Mn, Co, Cu, and Rb were the elements that were identified to have discrimination ability. 96 % <b>of</b> <b>wines</b> and 100 % of vineyard soils were correctly classified.

40|$|SUMMARY: We {{present the}} CT andMR imaging {{findings}} in acute methanol intoxication in a 35 -year-old {{man who was}} admitted to the emergency department with weakness, blurred vision, mild bilateral areactive mydriasis, and a progressive decrease in the level of consciousness. CT and MR imaging showed bilateral putaminal hemorrhagic necrosis and subcortical white matter lesions with peripheral contrast enhancement. There was only partial improvement in patient’s Glasgow Coma Scale score during follow-up. Methanol is a clear, colorless, highly toxic liquid with asmell and taste similar to ethanol. It is used as a constit-uent {{of a large number of}} commercially available solvents. Methanol intoxication appears after accidental or suicidal oral ingestion of industrial solvents or cleaning and antifreeze liquids or occasionally is due to fraudulent <b>adulteration</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> or other alcoholic beverages.

40|$|Modeling {{the complex}} human taste is an {{important}} focus in wine industries. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to predict wine quality based on physicochemical data. This study was also conducted to identify outlier or anomaly in sample wine set in order to detect <b>adulteration</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine.</b> In this project, two large separate datasets are used, which contains 1, 599 instances for red wine and 4, 989 instances for white wine with 11 attributes of physicochemical data such as alcohol, PH and sulfates. Two classification algorithms, Decision tree and Naïve Bayes are applied on the dataset and the performance of these two algorithms is compared. Results showed that Decision tree (ID 3) outperformed Naïve Bayesian techniques particularly in red wine, which is the most common type. The study also showed that two attributes, alcohol and volatile-acidity contribute highly to wine quality. White wine is also more sensitive to changes in physicochemistry as opposed to red wine, hence higher level of handling care is necessary. This research concludes that classification approach will give rooms for corrective measure to be taken in effort to increase the quality of wine during production...|$|E
40|$|Consumers, regulators, and {{the food}} {{industry}} increasingly require that foods comply {{not only with the}} label descriptions of food content, but also with information regarding the food origin. For example, the wine industry {{has a long history of}} labelling wines based on varietal, regional, or age (vintage) - related properties. However, regulatory agencies are now beginning to require methods to confirm this label information. Wine retailers are also facing voluntary or mandatory labelling requirements that will indicate regional or country-of-origin, species and/or varietal information. As a result, development of reliable analytical methods to confirm the authenticity of the label information is needed. The <b>adulteration</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> is usually accomplished by addition of alcohol, water, dyes and aromas to wine of minor commercial value. As these wines are usually produced with inadequate conditions of hygiene, they become of high risk for the human health. Another risk for the consumer of adulterated wines is the ingestion of products elaborated of raw materials not under control evidence. The aim of this study was to identify the adulterated wines obtained in vineyards of Vrancea County by the private and local producers during the time period of 2006 - 2008. From the 913 wine samples analysed it was noticed that the cheap wines are frequently adulterated. The trend of wine adulterations from Vrancea County had a decreasing value from 2006 (70. 3 %) to 2008 (35. 1 %). The decreasing of the adulterated wines from 2006 to 2008 is probably due to the application of Romanian legislative regulations on wine quality level...|$|E
50|$|The grape is {{believed}} to have originated in Greece and made its way to the Friuli-Venezia Giulia by way of Slovenia. The first written documentation of the grape was in a 1289 notarial contract on vineyard land in the Friuli region. During the 14th century, the Italian poet Giovanni Boccaccio listed indulgence <b>of</b> Ribolla <b>wines</b> as one <b>of</b> the sins of gluttony in his diatribe on the subject. When the Duke of Austria, Leopold III, established reign over Trieste one of his stipulations was that the city supply him each year with 100 urns of the region's best Ribolla wine. By 1402, the reputation <b>of</b> the <b>wine</b> made from the grape was high enough for the city of Udine to feel compelled to enact a law which prohibited the <b>adulteration</b> <b>of</b> any <b>wine</b> made from Ribolla. In the 18th century, the Italian writer Antonio Musnig rated Ribolla wine as the finest white wine in the Friuli. The phylloxera epidemic of the 19th century took a hard toll on Ribolla plantings with many Friuli vineyards owners choosing to replant their land with imported French wine grapes like Merlot and Sauvignon blanc rather than the local grape varieties. By the 1990s less than 1% of all white Friuli wines created under a Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) designation contained Ribolla. By the turn of the 21st century, international interest in the <b>wines</b> <b>of</b> the Friuli-Venezia Giulia had led to an increase in plantings of the grape. Today it has a more prominent roles in the white DOC <b>wines</b> <b>of</b> Colli Orientali del Friuli and Collio Goriziano.|$|R
