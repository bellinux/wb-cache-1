5|$|Bremner's last cap came against Denmark on 3 September 1975. An {{incident}} in Copenhagen {{after the game}} where several players were ejected from a nightclub for an alleged fight led to a lifetime ban from international football by the Scottish Football Association; four other players, Willie Young, Joe Harper, Pat McCluskey and Arthur Graham <b>also</b> <b>were</b> banned for life (Graham and Harper later had their bans overturned). Bremner maintained his innocence, stating that the incident had been {{blown out of proportion}} by the SFA.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, the Lascaris War Rooms {{were built}} in Valletta {{to serve as the}} war {{headquarters}} for the defence of Malta. They were later used in the headquarters of the Allied invasion of Sicily. Throughout the war, many air-raid shelters <b>also</b> <b>were</b> dug in the limestone rock of the islands, either by the government or by individuals or families, to protect the civilian population of Malta from Italian or German aerial bombardment. Many of the shelters still exist, and a few are open to the public.|$|E

5|$|Greinke {{agreed to}} a six-year free agent {{contract}} with the Los Angeles Dodgers worth $147 million, on December 8, 2012. The deal, which was finalized on December 10, was the largest ever for a right-handed pitcher {{at the time it}} was signed. It was surpassed a year later by Félix Hernández's seven-year $175 million contract extension with the Seattle Mariners. Greinke later claimed that he chose the Dodgers over the Texas Rangers, who <b>also</b> <b>were</b> pursuing him, primarily because they offered more money.|$|E

5|$|The car {{appeared}} in the early 20th century to be pulled by horse again in the dirty thirties. In 1906, cars could be registered, and plates were issued as early as 1912. In the late 1920s the roads were gravelled near the larger centers such as Yorkton, Saskatoon, the Battlefords, and Lloydminster. All-weather roads were developed in the 1930s, which began to depart from the surveyed township roads connecting centres directly. Roads <b>also</b> <b>were</b> constructed to allow for rain run-off, with a rounded top surface.|$|E
5|$|The decisive {{confrontation}} between the Libyan-FAP forces and the Chadian regular forces took place at Faya-Largeau, {{the capital of the}} BET. The city, defended by 5,000 Chadian soldiers, fell on 18 February after sharp fighting to a force of 2,500 rebels, supported by possibly as many as 4,000 Libyan troops. The Libyans do not seem to have directly participated in the fighting; in a pattern that was to repeat itself in the future, the Libyans provided armor, artillery and air support. The rebels <b>also</b> <b>were</b> much better armed than before, displaying Strela-2 surface-to-air missiles.|$|E
