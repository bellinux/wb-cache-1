5|$|Whereas the {{dynamics}} of Jovian magnetosphere mainly depend on internal sources of energy, the solar wind probably has a role as well, particularly {{as a source of}} high-energy protons. The structure of the outer magnetosphere shows some features of a solar wind-driven magnetosphere, including a significant dawn–dusk asymmetry. In particular, magnetic field lines in the dusk sector <b>are</b> <b>bent</b> in the opposite direction to those in the dawn sector. In addition, the dawn magnetosphere contains open field lines connecting to the magnetotail, whereas in the dusk magnetosphere, the field lines are closed. All these observations indicate that a solar wind driven reconnection process, known on Earth as the Dungey cycle, may also be taking place in the Jovian magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is white, and the oval to oblong spores are 7.5–9.5μm long by 5.0–7.0μm wide. Spores are smooth, hyaline (translucent), nonamyloid, {{and have a}} {{prominent}} hilum. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to club shaped, four spored, and measure 39–50 by 8.0–9.6μm. The cystidia present on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are thin walled, hyaline, have a short stalk and a spherical apical portion, and measure 29–41 by 12–21μm; cystidia are absent from the gill face. The cap cuticle ranges in cellular form from a cutis (in which the hyphae <b>are</b> <b>bent</b> over, running parallel to the cap surface) to a trichoderm (with hyphae emerging roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface); the hyphae comprising the cuticle are cylindrical, and measure 2.0–9.0μm wide with a club-shaped tip up to 11μm wide.|$|E

The diffraction mode requires increased signal strength, so higher power or better antennas will be needed than for an equivalent line-of-sight path.|$|E

25|$|Wired gloves. These {{can provide}} input to the {{computer}} about the position and rotation of the hands using magnetic or inertial tracking devices. Furthermore, some gloves can detect finger bending {{with a high degree}} of accuracy (5-10 degrees), or even provide haptic feedback to the user, which is a simulation of the sense of touch. The first commercially available hand-tracking glove-type device was the DataGlove, a glove-type device which could detect hand position, movement and finger bending. This uses fiber optic cables running down the back of the hand. Light pulses are created and when the fingers <b>are</b> <b>bent,</b> light leaks through small cracks and the loss is registered, giving an approximation of the hand pose.|$|E
50|$|First, candy sticks cut to {{the desired}} length enter the machine. Each stick <b>is</b> <b>bent</b> individually, but the machine has a system of {{multiple}} grippers and rollers to continually bend the sticks, one after the other. As each stick enters the machine, it is positioned in a gripper which holds the straight portion of the cane with the part to <b>be</b> <b>bent</b> protruding out. Each gripper has on one side a curved die which the protruding end will <b>be</b> <b>bent</b> over. The candy stick <b>is</b> first <b>bent</b> to a right angle as it is moved past and put into contact with an inclined face.

25|$|Stance width helps {{determine}} the rider's {{balance on the}} board. The size of the rider {{is an important factor}} as well as the style of their riding when determining a proper stance width. A common measurement used for new riders is to position the bindings so that the feet are placed a little wider than shoulder width apart. Another, less orthodox form of measurement may be taken by putting your feet together and place your hands, palm down, on the ground in a straight line with your body by squatting down. This generally gives a good natural measurement for how wide of a base your body uses to properly balance itself when knees <b>are</b> <b>bent.</b> However, personal preference and comfort are important and most experienced riders will adjust the stance width to personal preference. Skateboarders should find that their snowboarding and skateboarding stance widths are relatively similar.|$|E
25|$|Triangles are sturdy; while a {{rectangle}} can collapse into a parallelogram from pressure {{to one of}} its points, triangles have a natural strength which supports structures against lateral pressures. A triangle will not change shape unless its sides <b>are</b> <b>bent</b> or extended or broken or if its joints break; in essence, {{each of the three}} sides supports the other two. A rectangle, in contrast, is more dependent on the strength of its joints in a structural sense. Some innovative designers have proposed making bricks not out of rectangles, but with triangular shapes which can be combined in three dimensions. It is likely that triangles will be used increasingly in new ways as architecture increases in complexity. It {{is important to remember that}} triangles are strong in terms of rigidity, but while packed in a tessellating arrangement triangles are not as strong as hexagons under compression (hence the prevalence of hexagonal forms in nature). Tessellated triangles still maintain superior strength for cantilevering however, and this is the basis for one of the strongest man made structures, the tetrahedral truss.|$|E
25|$|The end of wet season farming {{ends with}} Xantolo. It {{is similar to}} Day of the Dead and celebrated at the same time, but it has {{important}} differences. Xantolo brings people to cemeteries as well but it is to celebrate {{the living and the}} dead, as it marks the harvest of this growing season. Preparations for Xantolo last a week with altars remaining through November. Gifts of food are prepared to exchange with god parents, friends, family and neighbors. Altars consist of arches over a rectangular table. Each corner of the table has a pole to represent the four stages of human life (childhood, adolescence, adult and old age). The poles <b>are</b> <b>bent</b> towards the center above the table to form arches, and covered with branches of local flora. It shares certain elements with Day of the Dead such as cempasúchil flowers, papel picado and the creation of altars to the dead adorned with local fruit, candles and copal incense. It lasts from 29 October with the slaughter of pigs and turkeys. October 30 and 31 are for the remembrance of children and adults respectively and November 1 is not only for saints but also to honor godparents. A traditional dance for the event has groups of dancers who ridicule the powerful of the local society then are chained by a devil. These dancers perform with cloth masks, with the aim that Death does not recognize them and take them away.|$|E

25|$|The {{harmonic}} {{movements of}} the dolphin kick and flutter kick are {{in contrast to the}} breaststroke whip kick, which really deserves the name kick. Scissor kick and frog kick are intermediate. Humans have strong muscles in the legs and would need swim fins (like a frog) to bring all their power into the water and stand with the sole of the feet on the water. Rather the leg grabs almost as much water as the foot and a small amount of water is accelerated to high kinetic energy, but not much impulse is transferred. The toes <b>are</b> <b>bent,</b> the feet point 45° outwards, the sole points backwards, to mimic a hydrofoil. While closing in a V shape to the rear a small “lifting” force can be felt. Unlike in the other kicks, the joints are moved into extrema. Before the kick the knee is maximally bent and the upper leg is rotating along its axis to its extreme outer position and the lower leg is twisted to extreme, {{at the end of the}} kick the ankles are maximally turned to the inside so that the soles clap together to achieve a nozzle effect like in a jelly fish. Therefore, training involves getting flexible in addition to fitness and precision. The sudden sideways stress on knee at the kick can lead to uncomfortable noise and feeling for the beginner and to wear for the senior.|$|E

500|$|The Oliver’s typebars <b>are</b> <b>bent</b> in a bow (forming an {{inverted}} [...] "U" [...] shape) and rest in [...] "towers" [...] {{on the sides}} of the typewriter. This design limited the machine to a three-row QWERTY keyboard as the typebars were stacked such that they grew progressively larger as more were added. The size and usability implications of adding additional keys and thus, more typebars, precluded the addition of a fourth keyboard row dedicated to numbers. Although a four-row prototype was designed in 1922, it was shelved due to the company’s financial troubles at that time. The No. 20, No. 21 and portable models produced by the British Oliver Typewriter Company had four-row keyboards.|$|E
