5|$|Early COBOL compilers were {{primitive}} <b>and</b> <b>slow.</b> A 1962 US Navy evaluation found compilation {{speeds of}} 3–11 statements per minute. By mid-1964, they had increased to 11–1000 statements per minute. It was observed that increasing memory would drastically increase speed and that compilation costs varied wildly: costs per statement were between $0.23 and $18.91.|$|E

Since one cannot often afford to run AWE [12], constant time solutions are required. This work presents the first complete solution to closed form formulae for both delay <b>and</b> <b>slew.</b> Our metrics {{are derived from}} matching circuit moments to the lognormal distribution. From a single table, one can easily implement the metrics for delay <b>and</b> <b>slew</b> for both step and ramp inputs.

5|$|HMS Unrivalled (P45) was a U-class {{submarine}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy during World War II. The boat {{has been the only}} ship of the Royal Navy to ever bear the name Unrivalled.
