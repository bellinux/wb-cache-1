50|$|Safety is {{the biggest}} {{consideration}} for tree stands. A body harness {{is the most important}} part of tree stand safety. Many different styles of harness can keep hunters safe. One harness compiled of a belt around the waist of the person and one around tree with a strap between the two can keep the hunter safe. Another harness is a full body harness, which has shoulder straps and straps around the legs. The full body harness attaches to the tree the same way the <b>belt</b> <b>harness</b> does. Attaching the harness as soon as the hunter is in the tree keeps the hunter safe while setting up for the hunt. The strap between the harness and strap around the tree should be long enough to allow the hunter to move a little and short enough so if the hunter falls they do not fall too far.|$|R

50|$|Compared to scuba, snuba divers wear minimal gear. Each diver is {{equipped}} with a mask, fins, weight <b>belt,</b> <b>harness</b> and regulator. The harness holds the regulator and air line in place, allowing the diver to swim unencumbered beneath the surface. This may be compared to full scuba gear, which includes a buoyancy compensator, weights, cylinder and often more, and can weigh in excess of 27 kg. Although scuba equipment is nearly weightless underwater, out of the water the weight becomes a significant factor for weaker individuals. Unlike scuba divers, the snuba diver is not provided with an emergency buoyancy system, meaning that in case of emergency the snuba diver must reach the surface himself or await the arrival of assistance. On the other hand, a correctly weighted snuba diver will be neutrally buoyant at all depths (no compressible dive suit), has a hose and harness to prevent sinking, can pull on the hose to surface, which is less effort than swimming, and has a raft with a grab-rope to hold on to at the surface.|$|R
