40|$|AbstractAimThe {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effectiveness of scaling and root planing (SRP) and adjunctive chemotherapy (doxycycline hyclate, 20 mg) on gingival health, specific cytokines and glycemic control in diabetic subjects. MethodsThree hundred and forty-six type 1 and 2 diabetic subjects were randomized into four test groups: (1) one session of SRP <b>at</b> the <b>baseline</b> visit and placebo tablets twice/day, started <b>at</b> the <b>baseline</b> visit, for 3 months, (2) one session of SRP <b>at</b> the <b>baseline</b> visit, and doxycycline hyclate (20 mg, twice/day) started <b>at</b> the <b>baseline</b> visit for 3 months, (3) two sessions of SRP, first <b>at</b> the <b>baseline</b> visit and second at the 6 months, with placebo tablets twice/day started <b>at</b> the <b>baseline</b> visit and 6 -month visit, for 3 months at each visit, and (4) two sessions of SRP, first <b>at</b> the <b>baseline</b> visit and the second at the 6 -month visit, and doxycycline hyclate 20 mg twice/day, started <b>at</b> the <b>baseline</b> visit and the 6 -month visit, for 3 months at each visit. Venous blood samples were obtained to evaluate TNF-α, IL- 1 α and glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c); dental measurements were also included. ResultsHbA 1 c showed significant improvement (P< 0. 05) only for subjects with glycated hemoglobin ⩽ 8. 8 % within each group, as well as when subjects were combined together. All groups achieved statistically significant improvements for most of the dental parameters at follow-up visits (P< 0. 05) compared to the baseline. ConclusionsEliminating periodontal inflammation may significantly reduce glycated hemoglobin levels for subjects with HbA 1 c ⩽ 8. 8 %; furthermore, SRP and adjunctive therapy improved periodontal inflammation in diabetics...|$|R

25|$|In mice, mERG and KCNQ1, another Kv α subunit {{regulated}} by KCNE2, are neither influential nor highly expressed in adult ventricles. However, Kcne2-/- mice exhibit QT prolongation <b>at</b> <b>baseline</b> at 7 months of age, or earlier if provoked with a QT-prolonging agent such as sevoflurane. This is because KCNE2 is a promiscuous regulatory subunit that forms complexes with Kv1.5 and with Kv4.2 in adult mouse ventricular myocytes. KCNE2 increases currents though Kv4.2 channels and slows their inactivation. KCNE2 {{is required for}} Kv1.5 to localize to the intercalated discs of mouse ventricular myocytes. Kcne2 deletion in mice reduces the native currents generated in ventricular myocytes by Kv4.2 and Kv1.5, namely Ito and IKslow, respectively.|$|E
