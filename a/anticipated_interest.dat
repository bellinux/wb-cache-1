40|$|The {{first part}} of this paper is devoted to present some {{empirical}} evidence on the empirical IS curve that relates the aggregate demand to the real <b>anticipated</b> <b>interest</b> rate and the ratio of the public debt to GDP. The result of the empirical analysis is in favor of the presence of an empirical IS curve in which the aggregate demand is significantly affected by both the real <b>anticipated</b> <b>interest</b> rate and the public debt-to-GDP. In particular, the empirical finding on negative debt-elasticities of the aggregate demand in the empirical IS curve suggests the modification of the criteria used for the conventional distinction between non-Ricardian and Ricardian regimes. While the conventional distinction tells that the Taylor principle delivers an explosive dynamics of equilibrium path in a non-Ricardian regime with an exogenous primary surplus process, the estimated empirical IS curve indicates that a unique local equilibrium path requires the Taylor principle even with non-Ricardian regime in the presence of negative debt-elasticities of the aggregate demand. Furthermore, since the main modelling point of this paper is that the IS curve is the key equation for the transmission of the public debt, a goal {{of this paper is to}} see a variety of alternative theoretic mechanisms that might help include the public debt into the IS curve. As a result, a set of different models are discussed in this paper: Sovereign-risk based channel or Risk-premium (financial friction) based channel, Modified liquidity-effect channel, and Market-segmentation (in market for government securities) channel...|$|E

In response to these problems, the 2001 and 2004 German pension reforms reduced the statuory level of benefits from the pay-as-you system.

This paper examines the extent to which households are in a position today to close this gap with their personal assets, assuming that they stick to their current saving and asset accumulation behaviour. Four critical factors are relevant to this issue: 1. the anticipated life expectancy, 2. the level of personal assets on retirement, 3. the expected age of retirement and 4. the <b>anticipated</b> <b>interest</b> rate. Our results indicate that about a third of German households {{will not be able to}} fill the pension gap unless they were to change their current savings behaviour...|$|E

An efficient market would, at least partially, <b>anticipate</b> <b>interest</b> rate cuts and rapidly adjust. While the domestic stock and foreign exchange markets generally do not react on the Czech National Bank?s interest rate changes, changes to the central bank?s key repo rate do affect Czech interest rates. In line with model expectations, the response of the shorter rates is relatively stronger. The reaction of Czech interest rates, however, appear to be grossly inefficient. Rate movements in anticipation of official rate changes are virtually absent. Moreover, adjustments to rate changes take several days?even in the case of shorter rates, which are influenced more directly by the central bank?s repurchase rate it takes up to five working days to fully adjust to a rate change. market efficiency; interest rates...|$|R
40|$|On a Friday {{that the}} Fed announces a money supply greater {{than had been}} <b>anticipated,</b> <b>interest</b> rates move up in response. Why? One {{explanation}} is that the market perceives the fluctuation in the moneystock as an unintended deviation from the Fed's target growth rate that will be reversed in subsequent periods. The anticipation of this future tightening drives up interest rates today. A second {{explanation is that the}} market perceives the increase in the money supply as signalling a higher target growth rate. The expected future inflation rate rises,which is reflected in a higher nominal Interest rate. This paper offers grounds for choosing between the two possible explanations: evidence from the exchange market. Under the first explanation, anticipated future tightening, one would expect the dollar to appreciate against foreign currencies. Under the second explanation,expected inflation, one would expect it to depreciate. We render these claims more concrete by a formal model, a generalization of the Dornbusch overshooting model. Then we use the mark/dollar rate toanswer the question. We find a statistically significant tendency for the dollar to appreciate following positive money supply surprises. This supports the first explanation. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{model the}} impact credit {{constraints}} and market risk {{have on the}} vertical relationships between firms in the supply chain. We study the effects on short-run retail prices; long-run investment levels; and incentives to outsource. The analysis begins by showing that credit constrained risk neutral firms become endogenously risk averse. They therefore wish to push some risk onto suppliers. The optimal risk-sharing contract proposed by the credit constrained party involves a slotting fee (prevalent in groceries) or risk sharing. This generates double marginalization: credit constraints push up short run retail prices. We demonstrate that this effect may be exacerbated {{by an increase in}} the <b>anticipated</b> <b>interest</b> rate the firm can borrow at (“tight money”). This provides a new explanation for the price puzzle in macroeconomics. Further, the possibility of supplier-insurance implies that out-sourcing to a credit-unconstrained supplier dominates in-house provision. We show that there is an intrinsic complementarity between supplier insurance and lending so that a supplier might be {{in a better position to}} provide a loan than the bank-ing sector. This is consistent with the practice of finance arms of major suppliers linking lending to supply deals. We consider the impact on consumers of supply contract changes arising from: a deterioration of corporate governance; shocks to demand; shocks to market risk; changes in investment opportunities; and mergers and acquisitions.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{measurement}} of <b>anticipated</b> <b>interest</b> rate policy {{and the effects of}} these expectations on the term structure of nominal interest rates. It is shown that, under the expectations hypothesis, the level of long-term interest rates depends on three factors: the level of the monetary policy interest rate, ie the steering rate; the spread between the market interest rate and the steering rate; and market expectations of the next steering rate change. The theoretical model builds on the assumption that market participants have only imperfect knowledge of the mechanism whereby changes in the steering rate are determined. As a consequence, expectations formation, although realistic, need not be entirely rational. Steering rate changes take the form of discrete jumps and occur infrequently on a daily scale. Given these assumptions, discussion of the determination of the term structure is related to the literature on uncertainty about monetary policy regimes and small samples, ie "peso" problems. Empirical analysis based on Nelson–Siegel estimates of the daily yield curves in Finland in the period 1 January 1993 to 31 October 1997 complements the theoretical discussion. The observed differences between estimated market expectations and actual tender rate changes are quite large in the sample, particularly for the longer maturities. The approach applied in this study is promising, not only in the sense of potentially providing estimates of market expectations concerning future discrete changes in monetary policy interest rates but also in the sense of its apparent potential in accounting for the often reported poor empirical performance of the expectations hypothesis. term structure of interest rates; expectations; target changes; peso problems...|$|E

40|$|There {{is ample}} {{evidence}} of a self-sustaining U. S. economic recovery fueled by improved consumer spending, business investment and housing activity. These conditions have led to rapid {{economic growth in the}} last three quarters of 2014. In recent months, the national economy also has benefited from a steep decline in gasoline prices. These fundamental macroeconomic conditions are expected to persist over the next three years. However, the pace of growth will likely vary. In particular, economic growth may be challenged in early 2015 due to shocks in the international economy. China is facing a period of reckoning after propping up economic growth for decades with unnecessary government “investment” in highways, railways and buildings. At the same time, rapid economic decline in a mismanaged Russia is limiting growth in Europe. An already weak European economy is struggling to adjust to this shock but should be able to recover again during 2015. The sharp drop in oil prices also will depress growth in oil-producing regions within the United States. Another factor is an <b>anticipated</b> <b>interest</b> rate increase by the Federal Reserve Bank. These rate increases have been long anticipated and the Fed has strongly signaled that the first rate increase remains on schedule for mid- 2015. However, there is uncertainty about the timing of the rate increase and concerns about the pace of the increase. This uncertainty may postpone some business decisions but should be resolved by mid- 2015 as the Federal Reserve Bank begins a regime of slow, steady rate increases. This is when economic growth should begin to re-accelerate. Overall growth in 2015 will be solid and there will be stronger growth in 2016 and 2017. Real GDP growth is expected to reach 2. 4 % in 2015. Growth will accelerate to 2. 6 % in 2016 and 2017. Solid growth in real GDP will support continued improvement in the labor market. The rate of job growth, however, will decline as the economy edges towards full employment. Job growth will reach 1. 8 % in 2015, 1. 6 % in 2016 and 1. 5 % in 2017. With the decline in oil prices, inflation will be 1. 7 % in 2015 before ticking up to its long-term rate of 2. 0 % in 2016 and 2017. As has been true in recent years, several factors will limit annual economic growth to around 2. 5 %. The steady retirement of baby-boom generation workers will limit growth in the labor force. Economic growth also will be limited by several unmet policy needs. For example, there is an unmet need to pass immigration reform to meet workforce skills gaps and grow the working age population. There is also a need for tax reform to encourage business confidence and investment. Entitlement reform also would help build the confidence of both businesses and households. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that these key reforms will be addressed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Content Centric Networking (CCN) is a {{recently}} proposed information-centric Internet architecture {{in which the}} main network abstraction is represented by location-agnostic content identifiers instead of node identifiers. In CCN each content object is divided into packet-size chunks. When a content object is transferred, routers on the path can cache single chunks which they can use to serve subsequent requests from other users. Since content chunks in CCN may be retrieved {{from a number of}} different nodes/caches, implicit-feedback transport protocols {{will not be able to}} work efficiently, because it is not possible to set an appropriate timeout value based on RTT estimations given that the data source may change frequently during a flow. In order to address this problem, we propose in this paper a scalable, implicit-feedback congestion control protocol, capable of coping with RTT unpredictability using a novel <b>anticipated</b> <b>interests</b> mechanism to predict the location of chunks before they are actually served. Our evaluation shows that our protocol outperforms similar receiver-driven protocols, in particular when content chunks are scattered across network paths due to reduced cache sizes, long-tail content popularity distribution or the adoption of specific caching policies.
