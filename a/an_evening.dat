Usually, in <b>an</b> <b>Evening</b> Gown match, {{the woman}} who {{forcibly}} removes her opponent's dress wins. Because Sable removed Debra's dress, she therefore {{should have been the}} winner. Commissioner Shawn Michaels, however, ruled that he considered {{the woman who}} had lost her dress the winner, crowning Debra the new Women's Champion. Debra lost the Women's Title to Ivory on June 14, due to interference from Nicole Bass.|$|E
