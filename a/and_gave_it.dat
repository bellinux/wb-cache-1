5|$|Another {{earthquake}} {{struck in}} 1202, {{and it may}} have been after this event that the castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle's inner court or ward. If there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current outer walls, no trace of it has been discovered.|$|E

5|$|British {{ichthyologist}} Charles Tate Regan described Spheroides liosomus in 1909 from specimens {{collected in}} Melbourne, Hobart, Flinders Island and Port Phillip.

Australian biologist Gilbert Whitley equated Regan's description with Fréminville's original naming <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> the combination Spheroides glaber in 1955, and later Gastrophysus glaber in 1964.|$|E

5|$|Further {{proposals}} {{based on}} the delta wing resulted in {{two versions of the}} design known as C104: the single engine C104/4 and twin-engined C104/2. The designs were otherwise similar, using a low-mounted delta-wing; the primary advantages of the C104/2 were a larger overall size which offered a much larger internal weapons bay, at the time a cutting-edge feature in a fighter, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> twin-engine reliability. The proposals were submitted to the RCAF in June 1952.|$|E

5|$|The creek whaler was {{described}} by Australian ichthyologist Gilbert Percy Whitley in a 1943 volume of Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. He assigned the new species to the subgenus Uranganops of the genus Galeolamna, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> the specific epithet fitzroyensis because the type specimen, a 1.2-m-long female, was collected from Connor's Creek in the Fitzroy River estuary.

5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the Portuguese dogfish was published by Portuguese zoologists José Vicente Barbosa du Bocage and Félix António de Brito Capello, in an 1864 issue of Proceedings of the General Meetings for Scientific Business of the Zoological Society of London. They created the new genus Centroscymnus for this shark, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> the specific epithet coelolepis, derived from the Greek koilos ("hollow") and lepis ("fish scale") and referring {{to the structure of}} the dermal denticles. The type specimen, caught off Portugal, has since been destroyed in a fire.|$|E

5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the night shark was published by Cuban zoologist Felipe Poey in 1868, {{as part of a}} series of papers entitled Repertorio fisico-natural de la isla de Cuba. He based his description on a single set of jaws <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> the name Hypoprion signatus. In 1973, Leonard Compagno synonymized the genus Hypoprion with Carcharhinus. No type specimen has been designated for this species. Its common name {{comes from the fact that}} it is mostly captured at night.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Faxai {{began as}} an area of {{convection}} that persisted about 805kilometers (500mi) west of Guam on October24. Satellite imagery indicated broad cyclonic turning in {{the lower levels of}} the atmosphere, and a trough was located near the surface. Convection consolidated around the center of the low-level circulation, and the upper-level environmentlow wind shear and good divergencefavored development. The following day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression. Shortly after, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as convection deepened around a partially exposed low. The storm traveled northwest under the influences of a subtropical ridge to the north. At 0000UTC on October26, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) designated the system as a tropical depression <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> the local name Juaning. Around the same time, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> the name Faxai.|$|E

5|$|British {{ichthyologist}} Charles Tate Regan {{described the}} tiger catshark in a 1904 {{issue of the}} scientific journal Annals and Magazine of Natural History, based on two specimens presented to the British Museum by J. F. Queckett. He placed the species in the genus Scyllium (a synonym of Scyliorhinus) <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> the specific epithet , because the type specimens were reportedly collected off the Natal coast of South Africa (though there is suspicion that they were mislabelled and actually came from Algoa Bay). Later authors reassigned this species to the genus Halaelurus. The lined catshark (Halaelurus lineatus) was once treated as conspecific to the tiger catshark, until it {{was described as a}} separate species in 1975.|$|E
5|$|By August 15, {{convection}} {{began to}} consolidate around {{the center of}} the system as it passed over the Florida Keys. Early on August16, the system rapidly organized, with a low-level circulation developing roughly 80mi (130km) southwest of Tampa, Florida. Favorable environmental conditions led to the NHC anticipating the system to develop into a tropical depression later that day. Several hours later, the first advisory was issued on Tropical Depression Four. Low wind shear provided an environment that promoted quick development of the cyclone and the storm was forecast to attain tropical storm status within 12 hours. The depression tracked northwest around the periphery of a subtropical ridge to the east. Around 11:00am EDT, the NHC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> the name Claudette in light of information from the NEXRAD Doppler weather radar in Tallahassee, Florida that found winds of 40mph (65km/h) around the center of circulation.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1700s, John Tynte owned {{what is now}} the Tyntesfield estate; at that time the house was {{approached}} by an avenue of elm trees, planted after they were bequeathed in the 1678 will of Sir Charles Harbord to the people of Wraxall in memory of two boys he had apprenticed from the village. The Tynte's had originally lived on the estate, but by the early 1800s, John had made Chelvey Court in Brockley his principal residence. Tynte's Place was downgraded to a farmhouse and leased to John Vowles. In 1813, George Penrose Seymour of the adjoining Belmont estate purchased the property <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> to his son, the Rev. George Turner Seymour. He in turn built a new Georgian mansion {{on the site of the}} former Saddler's Tenement, and demolished the old farmhouse. Further remodelling was undertaken by Robert Newton of Nailsea.|$|E
