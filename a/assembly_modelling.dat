40|$|In the {{distributed}} and horizontally {{integrated manufacturing}} environment in Agile Manufacturing, {{there is a}} great demand for new product development methods that are capable of generating new cus-tomized assembly designs based on mature component designs that might be dispersed at geographically distributed partner sites. To cater for this demand, this paper addresses the methodology for complex as-sembly variant design in agile manufacturing. It consists of fundamental research in two parts: <b>assembly</b> <b>modeling</b> and <b>assembly</b> variant design methodology. This paper, the first of a two-part series, presents the assembly variant design system architecture and the <b>assembly</b> <b>modeling</b> methodology. First, comple-mentary <b>assembly</b> <b>modeling</b> concept is proposed with two kinds of <b>assembly</b> <b>models,</b> the Hierarchical <b>Assembly</b> <b>Model</b> and the Relational <b>Assembly</b> <b>Model.</b> The first explicitly captures the hierarchical and functional relationships between constituent components while the second explicitly captures the mat-ing relationships at the form feature level. These models are complementary in the sense that each of them models only a specific aspect of assembly related information while together they include required assembly related information. They are further specialized to accommodate the features of assembly variant design. As a result, two kinds of <b>assembly</b> <b>models,</b> the <b>Assembly</b> Variants <b>Model</b> (AVM) and the Assembly Mating Graph (AMG), are generated. These <b>assembly</b> <b>models</b> {{serve as the basis for}} assembly variant design which is discussed in the second part...|$|R

40|$|Dimensional {{quality control}} remains a {{challenge}} in assembly of complex products. Currently dimensional variation control research efforts include tolerance analysis and allocation, fixture layout design, assembly sequence planning, and others, without systematically viewing assembly {{as a proxy for}} a wide range of design decisions to produce final products with least cost, most productivity and best quality. A literature review in current <b>assembly</b> <b>modelling</b> methods shows that a unified data structure has yet to be developed at a preliminary design phase in order to design product and plan assembly process automatically. This paper serves to develop such a data structure, which captures heterogeneous product and assembly process information available at a preliminary design phase and unifies them in a data structure represented as a hierarchical graph. The graph-based data structure, on one side, facilitates automatic product design and assembly process planning at the preliminary design phase by utilising research results developed in graph theory, and on the other side, allows easier embedding the assembly model into computer aided design (CAD) software since they share the similar data structure.

The theoretical concepts for subsequent tolerance analysis are also provided. The computer aided tolerancing tool {{is part of}} a feature based object oriented (re) -design support system, called FROOM. FROOM's <b>assembly</b> <b>modelling</b> capabilities provide basic information for functional tolerance specification. Assembly constraints are satisfied by means of degrees of freedom (DOF) analysis. This method is based on the use of kinematic analogies. The rotations and translations (macro [...] DOF's) that components are allowed to have, are inferred using this technique. The tolerance representation in FROOM is based on the TTRS method, by Clment et al., which is also based on kinematic analogies. In this method, the small displacements that are allowed in the tolerance zone can be described by a tolerance torsor or transformation matrix. Using the tolerance torsor or transformation matrix, tolerances are described as constraints. The small displacements that are still allowed by means of the torsor are referred to as micro-DOF's. For tolerance analysis, the torsor approach offers a mathematically correct description of tolerance zones, although a lot of equations are generated.

40|$|Many {{geometrical}} quality {{problems that}} arise during production and assembly {{can be traced}} back to the way parts are designed and located to each other; that is, how the interface geometry and locating schemes are designed and selected. Today, locating schemes are often generated after the geometry has been set, or as a consequence of the part geometries being designed. In many situations, locating schemes are not deliberately designed or defined at all. This often results in assembly and positioning situations that are not clearly defined, analysed or understood by the designer. Since the way parts are located to each other is critical for how geometrical variation will propagate and cause variation in critical product dimensions, more emphasis should be put on this activity in early design phases in order to avoid assembly and production problems later on. This work proposes a structured top-down procedure for selecting locating systems for parts and subassemblies, and presents design guidelines to assist <b>assembly</b> <b>modelling.</b> The procedure can be seen as a first step in robust design and tolerance analysis in the area of geometry design and assurance.
