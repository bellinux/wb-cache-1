5|$|Shielded metal {{arc welding}} {{is one of the}} world's most popular welding processes, {{accounting}} for over half of all welding in some countries. Because of its versatility and simplicity, it is particularly dominant in the maintenance and repair industry, and is heavily used in the construction of steel structures and in industrial fabrication. In recent years its use has declined as flux-cored arc welding has expanded in the construction industry and gas {{metal arc welding}} has become more popular in industrial environments. However, because of the low equipment cost and wide applicability, the process will likely remain popular, especially among amateurs <b>and</b> <b>small</b> <b>businesses</b> where specialized welding processes are uneconomical and unnecessary.|$|E

40|$|A {{dominant}} trope {{of media}} commentary after the 2004 federal election was {{the rise of}} blue-collar self-employment <b>and</b> <b>small</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> its negative impact on Labor electoral support. In this paper I examine the evidence on the growth of self-employment <b>and</b> <b>small</b> <b>business</b> in Australia since the 1980 s and the political consequences of this growth. I consider why the growth of self-employment <b>and</b> <b>small</b> <b>business</b> has been overstated by many observers, {{and the emergence of}} a right-wing anti-capitalism in the critique of the dependence of wage-labour. Although the growth of self-employment <b>and</b> <b>small</b> <b>business</b> has been overstated it is a real phenomenon. I extract the rational kernel from the largely ill-informed commentary on this issue and place contemporary debates about self-employment in a historical and global context. I consider why the self-employed <b>and</b> <b>small</b> <b>business</b> were once seen as natural allies of the working-class in a populist coalition but why they are now identified by commentators as hostile to class politics. <br /...|$|R

5|$|However, the United Kingdom courts {{gradually}} {{adopted a}} single sufficient interest test for all prerogative orders. In R. v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise, ex parte Cook (1969), for example, the High Court used a sufficient interest test {{to determine whether}} an applicant had standing {{to apply for a}} mandatory order. Singapore followed the UK's move towards a uniform test for all prerogative orders. In Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1986), the Court of Appeal endorsed the sufficient interest test for mandatory orders. In that case, the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a mandamus (now known as a mandatory order) to ensure that the Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor. The Court, applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed <b>and</b> <b>Small</b> <b>Businesses</b> Ltd. (1981), held that the test for standing was whether the applicant had a sufficient interest in the subject matter, and not whether he or she had a specific legal right.|$|E
