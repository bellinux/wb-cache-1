2500|$|One of Crosby's songwriting {{contributions}} to the album, [...] "What's Happening?!?!", began his penchant for writing abstract songs asking irresoluble questions, a trend that has continued throughout his career with Crosby, Stills & Nash and as a solo artist. During a 1966 interview, Crosby admitted {{that it was a}} strange song, noting [...] "It asks questions of what's going on here and who does it all belong to <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> all going on. I just ask the questions because I really don't know the answers." [...] Like [...] "Eight Miles High", the song exhibits the strong influence of Indian classical music with its droning guitar and melody. [...] "What's Happening?!?!" [...] is also notable for being the first song written solely by Crosby to appear on a Byrds' record.|$|E

In his view, the Iron Dome allows the various Israeli governments to undertake a [...] "limited (military) operation" [...] and therefore shift discussion away from other topics such as the economic recession and corruption concerns. According to Misgav, the Iron Dome does not only shoot down missiles, it also [...] "shoots {{down some of the}} capacity of Israelis for free thought, [...] it reduces their motivation to ask themselves how and why the present 'round of escalation' has started, who escalated it? Who does it serve? <b>And</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> that suddenly rockets are falling from the sky?" [...] Misgav further writes that the Iron Dome will not return peace to the residents of southern Israel nor the residents of the Gaza Strip who he claims live [...] "under siege".|$|E
