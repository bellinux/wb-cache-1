5|$|Common motifs of the Parthian period include {{scenes of}} royal hunting expeditions and the {{investiture}} of Arsacid kings. Use of these motifs extended to include portrayals of local rulers. Common art mediums were rock-reliefs, frescos, and even graffiti. Geometric and stylized plant patterns {{were also used}} on stucco <b>and</b> <b>plaster</b> walls. The common motif of the Sassanid period showing two horsemen engaged in combat with lances {{first appeared in the}} Parthian reliefs at Mount Behistun.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, Stokesay Castle {{continued}} to be leased by the Baldwyn family, although they sublet the property {{to a range of}} tenants; after this point it ceased {{to be used as a}} domestic dwelling. Two wood <b>and</b> <b>plaster</b> buildings, built against the side of the hall, were demolished around 1800, and by the early 19th century the castle was being used for storing grain and manufacturing, including barrel-making, coining and a smithy.|$|E

5|$|Inside, the {{building}} held a two-story balconied main sanctuary and dining room, {{in addition to}} the basement kitchen and bathrooms. The heating system was in a sub-basement. The front ark and wood bimah in the sanctuary were ornate; the red velvet draped ark was elaborately decorated, and the bimah was also decorated, and supported a large bronze candelabra. The sanctuary floor was wood, with wood wainscoting <b>and</b> <b>plaster</b> walls.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{has been changed}} and expanded over the centuries. It now consists of a main 3 storey block with two wings. The interior includes fine wooden panelling <b>and</b> <b>plaster</b> ceilings. Some of the original fireplaces survive {{and many of the}} rooms include decorative stained glass. It is surrounded by landscaped grounds including a sunken garden and a knot garden. There is a 17th century barn adjacent to the house.|$|E
5|$|The house {{also has}} {{significant}} interior features, including marble fireplaces, wood paneling, coffered ceilings, window and door architraves, parquet floors, and extensive carved wood <b>and</b> <b>plaster</b> detail, {{primarily in the}} Adamesque mold. The original furnishings together were reported in 1895 to have cost {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars, and to have included rare tapestries, carved woods, paintings, and Italian marble.|$|E

5|$|The {{house is}} built with stone foundations, {{and the main}} {{structure}} is made of oak timbers, joined together using mortice and tenon joints, and held in place with oak pegs. Wattle and daub or lath <b>and</b> <b>plaster</b> are used to fill the spaces between the timbers. The black and white appearance from the timber framing construction dates from the Tudor period, though some parts have been repaired in later years.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, an {{exhibition}} in the Grand Palais of Paris {{was devoted to}} his work, during the annual salon of the Société des Beaux-Arts (Fine Arts Society) of France. Gaudí participated on the invitation of count Güell, displaying a series of pictures, plans <b>and</b> <b>plaster</b> scale models of several of his works. Although he participated hors concours, he received good reviews from the French press. A large part of this exposition could be seen the following year at the I Salón Nacional de Arquitectura {{that took place in}} the municipal exhibition hall of El Buen Retiro in Madrid.|$|E

Filming also took place in Shanghai.

5|$|Substantial {{alterations}} {{appear to}} have taken place {{during the early years of}} Samuel Egerton's ownership in the mid-18th century. The canopy at the dais end of the Great Hall was destroyed– although part of it can still be seen in the north wall– when a floor was inserted and new rooms were formed with lath <b>and</b> <b>plaster</b> partitions. The east wing of the hall was probably demolished at about the same time, but certainly before 1812, the date of the earliest estate map.|$|E
5|$|Thatched or tiled roofs were {{supported}} by wooden pillars, since the addition of brick, rammed earth, or mud walls of these halls did not actually support the roof. Stone <b>and</b> <b>plaster</b> were also used for domestic architecture. Tiled eaves projecting outward were built to distance falling rainwater from the walls; they {{were supported}} by dougong brackets that were sometimes elaborately decorated. Molded designs usually decorated the ends of roof tiles, as seen in artistic models of buildings and in surviving tile pieces.|$|E
5|$|The English and Danish editions {{differed}} in several significant ways. The English edition was somewhat shorter and more concise, and included newer information that Heilmann had acquired {{by studying the}} actual fossils of Archaeopteryx in Berlin, {{as well as from}} foreign scientists who sent him photographs <b>and</b> <b>plaster</b> casts. It also contained considerably less harsh language towards Boas and others with whom he disagreed. Curiously, the English edition did not contain the transformational sequences inspired by D'Arcy Thompson, though Heilmann still briefly acknowledged the use of his methods in reconstructing his Proavis.|$|E

5|$|The barracks {{was less}} than 10yards wide and 33yards long (9mx30m) and was divided into eight houses, each with three floors, {{containing}} 56 rooms in all. Each floor had seven rooms facing the front and seven in the back. There were no internal hallways. The rooms were accessed directly from the outside via eight narrow wooden staircases, a fire hazard given that the stairs provided the sole exit and the houses were separated only by thin lathe <b>and</b> <b>plaster</b> partitions.|$|E
5|$|The {{reconstruction}} of Castell Coch was delayed until 1875, {{because of the}} demands of work at Cardiff Castle and an unfounded concern by the Marquess's trustees that he was facing bankruptcy. On commencement, the Kitchen Tower, Hall Block and shell wall were rebuilt first, followed by the Well Tower and the Gatehouse, and the Keep Tower last. Burges's drawings for the proposed rebuilding survive at the Bute seat of Mount Stuart. The drawings were supplemented by {{a large number of}} wooden <b>and</b> <b>plaster</b> models, from smaller pieces to full-size models of furniture.|$|E
5|$|There {{was limited}} {{interference}} from Orion Pictures. Two suggestions Orion put forward included {{the addition of}} a canine android for Reese, which Cameron refused, and to strengthen the love interest between Sarah and Reese, which Cameron accepted. To create the Terminator's look, Winston and Cameron passed sketches back and forth, eventually deciding on a design nearly identical to Cameron's original drawing in Rome. Winston had a team of seven artists work for six months to create a Terminator puppet; it was first molded in clay, then plaster reinforced with steel ribbing. These pieces were then sanded, painted and then chrome-plated. Winston sculpted a reproduction of Schwarzenegger's face in several poses out of silicone, clay <b>and</b> <b>plaster.</b>|$|E

5|$|Egyptian {{literature}} was produced {{on a variety}} of media. Along with the chisel, necessary for making inscriptions on stone, the chief writing tool of ancient Egypt was the reed pen, a reed fashioned into a stem with a bruised, brush-like end. With pigments of carbon black and red ochre, the reed pen was used to write on scrolls of papyrus—a thin material made from beating together strips of pith from the Cyperus papyrus plant—as well as on small ceramic or limestone ostraca known as potsherds. It is thought that papyrus rolls were moderately expensive commercial items, since many are palimpsests, manuscripts that have their original contents erased to make room for new written works. This, alongside tearing off pieces of papyrus documents to make smaller letters, suggests that there were seasonal shortages caused by the limited growing season of Cyperus papyrus. It also explains the frequent use of ostraca and limestone flakes as writing media for shorter written works. In addition to stone, ceramic ostraca, and papyrus, writing media also included wood, ivory, <b>and</b> <b>plaster.</b>|$|E
5|$|Explorer and {{archaeologist}} Alfred Maudslay visited Quiriguá {{for three}} days in 1881; {{they were the first}} pre-Columbian ruins that he saw and they were sufficiently impressive to inspire him to take up a permanent interest in Central American archaeology. He was able to return on three further occasions, the last being in 1894, and he made the first efforts to clear the monuments before recording them. He carried out a very thorough examination and made a photographic record of all visible monuments, carried out some minor excavations, made paper <b>and</b> <b>plaster</b> molds of the hieroglyphic inscriptions and surveyed the principal sculptures; these molds were then shipped to the Victoria and Albert Museum, with casts being transferred to the British Museum.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{from the}} south of the undercroft is the abbot's passage which dates from around 1150 and {{consists}} of two bays with rib-vaulting. Above the abbot's passage, approached by a stairway from the west cloister, is StAnselm's Chapel which also dates from the 12thcentury. It is in three bays and has a 19thcentury Gothic-style plaster vault. The chancel is in one bay and was remodelled in the early 17thcentury. The screen, altar rails, holy table <b>and</b> <b>plaster</b> ceiling of the chancel date from the 17thcentury. The north range of the cloister gives access to a refectory, built by Simon deWhitchurch in the 13thcentury. It contains an Early English pulpit, approached by a staircase with an ascending arcade. The only other similar pulpit in England is in Beaulieu Abbey.|$|E
