5|$|Specific <b>adverse</b> {{events are}} related to the {{antiretroviral}} agent taken. Some relatively common <b>adverse</b> events include: lipodystrophy syndrome, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, especially with protease inhibitors. Other common symptoms include diarrhea, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Newer recommended treatments are associated with fewer <b>adverse</b> effects. Certain medications may be associated with birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping to have children.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 {{systematic}} review examined antioxidant medications, such as allopurinol and acetylcysteine, as add on treatment for schizophrenia. Evidence was insufficient to determine benefits {{and there was}} potential for <b>adverse</b> effects.|$|E
5|$|<b>Adverse</b> {{effects from}} {{medications}} {{are reported in}} 10 to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most <b>adverse</b> effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that {{are not related to}} dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to <b>adverse</b> effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the first trimester. Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications. Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.|$|E
5|$|Because of the <b>adverse</b> {{effects of}} cadmium on the {{environment}} and human health, the supply and use of cadmium is restricted in Europe under the REACH Regulation.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. Long-term use is controversial {{because of concerns about}} <b>adverse</b> psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of <b>adverse</b> effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term <b>adverse</b> effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults.|$|E
5|$|Calcium carbimide {{works in}} the same way as disulfiram; it has an {{advantage}} in that the occasional <b>adverse</b> effects of disulfiram, hepatotoxicity and drowsiness, do not occur with calcium carbimide.|$|E
5|$|Charret also {{admitted}} the series received <b>adverse</b> criticism {{for being too}} violent.|$|E
5|$|Chelating agents {{can have}} <b>adverse</b> effects; for example, {{chelation}} therapy can lower the body's levels of necessary nutrients like zinc. Chelating agents taken orally {{can increase the}} body's absorption of lead through the intestine.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin and {{adapalene}} {{in combination}} {{are also more}} effective than either drug alone, although <b>adverse</b> effects are more frequent.|$|E
5|$|Drug eruptions are <b>adverse</b> drug {{reactions}} that present with cutaneous manifestations.|$|E
5|$|If the PCMR submits an <b>adverse</b> report, Parliament {{can either}} make {{amendments}} to the bill and resubmit it to the Council for approval, or decide to present the bill for the President's assent nonetheless provided that a Parliamentary motion for such action has been passed by at least two-thirds of all MPs. The PCMR has not rendered any <b>adverse</b> reports since it {{was set up in}} 1970.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 {{the base}} {{had to be}} {{temporarily}} evacuated due to <b>adverse</b> weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, Brulé {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} that an <b>adverse</b> relationship with his father may have been at least partly to blame for his floundering NHL career.|$|E
5|$|In November 1988, B-1B (s/n 85-0076) {{from the}} 28th Bomb Wing, 37th Bomb Squadron, Ellsworth AFB crashed {{short of the}} runway at Ellsworth AFB during <b>adverse</b> weather. All four crew members ejected successfully.|$|E
5|$|In {{his reading}} of the {{unanimous}} decision, Justice Warren noted the <b>adverse</b> psychological effects that segregated schools had on African American children.|$|E
5|$|PEP {{treatment}} is recommended after {{a sexual assault}} when the perpetrator {{is known to be}} HIV positive, but is controversial when their HIV status is unknown. The duration of {{treatment is}} usually four weeks and is frequently associated with <b>adverse</b> effects—where zidovudine is used, about 70% of cases result in <b>adverse</b> effects such as nausea (24%), fatigue (22%), emotional distress (13%) and headaches (9%).|$|E
5|$|The entire {{route of}} the canal is {{protected}} from any <b>adverse</b> development that would prevent its restoration, having {{been included in the}} unitary development plans of Salford City Council, Bolton Council and Bury Council.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} <b>adverse</b> effect to {{acetylcysteine}} treatment is an anaphylactoid reaction, usually manifested by rash, wheeze, or mild hypotension. <b>Adverse</b> reactions {{are more common}} in people treated with IV acetylcysteine, occurring in up to 20% of patients. Alaphylactoid reactions {{are more likely to}} occur with the first infusion (the loading dose). Rarely, severe life-threatening reactions may occur in predisposed individuals, such as patients with asthma or atopic dermatitis, and may be characterized by respiratory distress, facial swelling, and even death.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} gradient can be positive (<b>adverse</b> {{pressure gradient}}) or negative (favorable pressure gradient).|$|E
5|$|The species migrates seasonally, at night, and can {{be carried}} {{downwind}} up to 400km. Pupae can make use of diapause to wait out <b>adverse</b> environmental conditions, especially at high latitudes and in drought.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that low doses of benzodiazepines reduce <b>adverse</b> effects of electroconvulsive therapy.|$|E
5|$|Under <b>adverse</b> conditions, {{relatively}} {{high concentrations of}} radioactive xenon isotopes may emanate from cracked fuel rods, or fissioning of uranium in cooling water.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{caution is}} {{required}} in the elderly, as they are {{more sensitive to the}} pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines, metabolise them more slowly, and are more prone to <b>adverse</b> effects, including drowsiness, amnesia (especially anterograde amnesia), ataxia, hangover effects, confusion, and falls.|$|E
5|$|All new {{subsidiary}} legislation must {{be sent to}} the Council for scrutiny within 14 days of their publication in the Government Gazette. The Council is then required to make its report to the Speaker and the appropriate Minister within 30 days. However, unlike with bills, there is no provision to extend the original deadline. As with bills, tardiness in sending an <b>adverse</b> report results in a conclusive presumption that the Council finds no differentiating measures in the {{subsidiary legislation}}. Where the Council issues an <b>adverse</b> report, the Minister must revoke or amend the offending provision within six months of the report, unless Parliament passes a resolution confirming that provision.|$|E
5|$|An {{unexpected}} <b>adverse</b> {{effect of}} {{daylight saving time}} {{may lie in the}} fact that an extra part of morning rush hour traffic occurs before dawn and traffic emissions then cause higher air pollution than during daylight hours.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the {{collision}} of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies should be underway. Although this {{could result in the}} Solar System being ejected from the newly combined galaxy, it is considered unlikely to have any <b>adverse</b> effect on the Sun or planets.|$|E
5|$|Cysts of {{the genus}} Azotobacter are more {{resistant}} to <b>adverse</b> environmental factors than the vegetative cells; in particular, they are twice as resistant to UV light. They are also resistant to drying, ultrasound and gamma and solar irradiation, but not to heating.|$|E
5|$|Each engine {{had its own}} {{intake and}} the engine {{nacelles}} were paired with a splitter plate between them to minimise <b>adverse</b> behaviour of one powerplant influencing the other. Only above Mach 1.6 was an engine surge likely to affect the adjacent engine.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{incidence}} of the <b>adverse</b> effects of dexamethasone are not available, hence estimates {{have been made}} as to the {{incidence of}} the <b>adverse</b> effects below based on the <b>adverse</b> effects of related corticosteroids and on available documentation on dexamethasone.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{elements}} of an <b>adverse</b> possession action are different in every jurisdiction, a person claiming <b>adverse</b> possession is usually required to prove non-permissive use of the property that is actual, open and notorious, exclusive, <b>adverse,</b> and continuous for the statutory period.|$|E
25|$|When {{used during}} pregnancy, the {{majority}} of <b>adverse</b> events caused by acupuncture were mild and transient, with few serious <b>adverse</b> events. The most frequent mild <b>adverse</b> event was needling or unspecified pain, followed by bleeding. Although two deaths (one stillbirth and one neonatal death) were reported, {{there was a lack}} of acupuncture-associated maternal mortality. Limiting the evidence as certain, probable or possible in the causality evaluation, the estimated incidence of <b>adverse</b> events following acupuncture in pregnant women was 131 per 10,000.|$|E
25|$|When used on children, {{acupuncture}} {{is considered}} safe when administered by well-trained, licensed practitioners using sterile needles; however, a 2011 review found there was limited research to draw definite {{conclusions about the}} overall safety of pediatric acupuncture. The same review found 279 <b>adverse</b> events, 25 of them serious. The <b>adverse</b> events were mostly mild in nature (e.g. bruising or bleeding). The prevalence of mild <b>adverse</b> events ranged from 10.1% to 13.5%, an estimated 168 incidences among 1,422 patients. On rare occasions <b>adverse</b> events were serious (e.g. cardiac rupture or hemoptysis); many {{might have been a}} result of substandard practice. The incidence of serious <b>adverse</b> events was 5 per one million, which included children and adults.|$|E
25|$|The main <b>adverse</b> {{effects of}} ACE {{inhibition}} {{can be understood}} from their pharmacological action. The other reported <b>adverse</b> effects are hepatotoxicity and effect on the fetus.|$|E
25|$|Introduced to the US {{market in}} September 2013 and hence data on its <b>adverse</b> effects may be lagging behind. Serotonin {{syndrome}} {{is a possible}} (rare) <b>adverse</b> effect.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{systematic}} {{review of the}} English-language case reports found that serious <b>adverse</b> events associated with acupuncture are rare, but that acupuncture is not without risk. Between 2000 and 2011 the English-language literature from 25 countries and regions reported 294 <b>adverse</b> events. The majority of the reported <b>adverse</b> events were relatively minor, and the incidences were low. For example, a prospective survey of 34,000 acupuncture treatments found no serious <b>adverse</b> events and 43 minor ones, a rate of 1.3 per 1000 interventions. Another survey found there were 7.1% minor <b>adverse</b> events, of which 5 were serious, amid 97,733 acupuncture patients. The most common <b>adverse</b> effect observed was infection (e.g. mycobacterium), {{and the majority of}} infections were bacterial in nature, caused by skin contact at the needling site. Infection has also resulted from skin contact with unsterilized equipment or with dirty towels in an unhygienic clinical setting. Other <b>adverse</b> complications included five reported cases of spinal cord injuries (e.g. migrating broken needles or needling too deeply), four brain injuries, four peripheral nerve injuries, five heart injuries, seven other organ and tissue injuries, bilateral hand edema, epithelioid granuloma, pseudolymphoma, argyria, pustules, pancytopenia, and scarring due to hot-needle technique. <b>Adverse</b> reactions from acupuncture, which are unusual and uncommon in typical acupuncture practice, included syncope, galactorrhoea, bilateral nystagmus, pyoderma gangrenosum, hepatotoxicity, eruptive lichen planus, and spontaneous needle migration.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adverse</b> {{effects can}} appear mechanically. The design of some {{surgical}} instruments may be decades old, hence certain <b>adverse</b> effects (such as tissue trauma) may {{have never been}} properly cauterized.|$|E
