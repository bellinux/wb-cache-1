50|$|<b>Angle</b> <b>parking,</b> {{known as}} echelon parking in Britain, {{is similar to}} {{perpendicular}} parking for these vehicles, except that cars are arranged {{at an angle to}} the aisle (an acute angle with the direction of approach).

While in theory the aisles are one-way, in practice they are typically wide enough to allow two cars to pass slowly when drivers go down the aisles the wrong way.|$|E

Further heavily criticised was the concurrent proposal by the Citizens & Ratepayers-dominated Council to remove the bus lanes and replace them with transit lanes allowing cars.|$|E
