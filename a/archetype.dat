5|$|Once Sarah Jane has {{analysed}} {{that the}} Bane ingredient was sentient, she activates her computer, Mr Smith - after some shouting by Kelsey - and contacts Wormwood and politely requests that she leaves Earth. Wormwood refuses, and in retaliation takes {{control of the}} majority of the human race. Sarah Jane races to the factory, but cannot enter until she drives the bus into a wall. Wormwood reveals the Bane Mother, and explains the <b>Archetype</b> is a conglomerate of human DNA designed to be investigated so that Bubble Shock could be improved. The <b>Archetype</b> uses an alien communicator Sarah Jane had been given, realising that the signal would be strong enough to kill the Bane Mother, and Sarah Jane, Maria, and the <b>Archetype</b> escape as the factory explodes.|$|E

This paper presents a set of <b>archetypes</b> to represent the main data from the Brazilian Public Hospital Information System and the High Complexity Procedures Module of the Brazilian public Outpatient Health Information System. The <b>archetypes</b> from the public openEHR Clinical Knowledge Manager (CKM), were examined in order to select <b>archetypes</b> {{that could be used}} to represent the data of the above mentioned systems. For several concepts, it was necessary to specialize the CKM <b>archetypes,</b> or design new ones. A total of 22 <b>archetypes</b> were used: 8 new, 5 specialized and 9 reused from CKM. This set of <b>archetypes</b> can be used not only for information exchange, but also for generating a big anonymized dataset for testing openEHR-based systems...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the {{feasibility}} and usefulness of expressing clinical data sets (CDSs) as openEHR <b>archetypes.</b> For this, we present an approach to transform CDS into <b>archetypes,</b> and outline typical problems with CDS and analyse whether some of these problems can be overcome by the use of <b>archetypes.</b> Methods: Literature review and analysis of a selection of existing Australian, German, other European and international CDSs; transfer of a CDS for Paediatric Oncology into openEHR archetypes; implementation of CDSs in application systems. Results: To explore the feasibility of expressing CDS as <b>archetypes</b> an approach to transform existing CDSs into <b>archetypes</b> is presented in this paper. In case of the Paediatric Oncology CDS (which consists of 260 data items) this lead to the definition of 48 openEHR <b>archetypes.</b> To analyse the usefulness of expressing CDS as <b>archetypes,</b> we identified nine problems with CDS that currently remain unsolved without a common model underpinning the CDS. Typical problems include incompatible basic data types and overlapping and incompatible definitions of clinical content. A solution to most of these problems based on openEHR <b>archetypes</b> is motivated. With regard to integrity constraints, further research is required. Conclusions: While openEHR cannot overcome all barriers to Ubiquitous Computing, it can provide the common basis for ubiquitous presence of meaningful and computer-processable knowledge and information, which we believe is a basic requirement for Ubiquitous Computing. Expressing CDSs as openEHR <b>archetypes</b> is feasible and advantageous as it fosters semantic interoperability, supports ubiquitous computing, and helps to develop <b>archetypes</b> that are arguably of better quality than the original CDS...|$|R

5|$|The {{literary}} critic G. Koster writes that, when writing Siti Akbari, Lie Kim Hok was {{limited by the}} formulaic Pandji romances and syair poems common in Malay literature at the time. Koster notes basic structural similarities between Siti Akbari and the existing poetic forms. The work followed the <b>archetype</b> of a hero or heroine going from a lawful kingdom into exile then into a chaotic kingdom, one which Koster suggests {{is representative of the}} cycle of oral law. Such an <b>archetype</b> and formulas were used in contemporary works such as Syair Siti Zubaidah Perang Cina (Poem on Siti Zubaidah and the War against China). The plot device of a woman passing herself as a man to do war was likewise common in Malay and Javanese literature. Lie deviated greatly from the established traditions, mixing European and native literary influences.|$|E

Variations from the standard dwarf <b>archetype</b> of a short and stout demihuman are commonly called subraces, of which {{there are more than a}} dozen across many different rule sets and campaign settings.|$|E

5|$|As a character, Spencer {{has been}} seen as an everyman figure, his blank {{expression}} and plain dress keeping him a simple <b>archetype.</b> Spencer displays a pacifistic and fatalistic inactivity throughout the film, simply allowing events to unfold around him without taking control. This passive behavior culminates in his sole act of instigation at the film's climax; his apparent act of infanticide is driven by his life of being domineered and controlled. Spencer's inactivity has also been seen by film critics Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc as a precursor to Lynch's 1983–92 comic strip The Angriest Dog in the World.|$|E

However, aspects of the character such as her smoking and her religious beliefs have been criticised, with religious groups suggesting Dot's faith is used in a pejorative manner.

The present study attempts to evaluate the representativeness of BRDF <b>archetypes</b> for surface reflectance anisotropy. Five-year forward-modeled MODIS multi-angular reflectance (MCD-ref) and aditional actual MODIS multi-angular observations (MCD-obs) in four growing periods in 2008 over three tiles were taken as validation data. First, BRDF <b>archetypes</b> in the principal plane were qualitatively compared with the time-series MODIS BRDF product of randomly sampled pixels. Secondly, BRDF <b>archetypes</b> were used to fit MCD-ref, and the average root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) over each tile were examined for these five years. Finally, both BRDF <b>archetypes</b> and the MODIS BRDF were used to fit MCD-obs, and the histograms of the fit-RMSEs were compared. The consistency of the directional reflectance between the BRDF <b>archetypes</b> and MODIS BRDFs in nadir-view, hotspot and entire viewing hemisphere at 30 ° and 50 ° solar geometries were also examined. The results confirm that BRDF <b>archetypes</b> are representative of surface reflectance anisotropy for available snow-free MODIS data...|$|R
