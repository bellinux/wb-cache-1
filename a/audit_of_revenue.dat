After the Proclamation of the Republic was announced in 1889, the government started to expand its administrative bodies, necessitating the introduction of a bureaucracy able to perform new functions. In the same period, Brazil experienced a strong economic development with the development of its coffee industry. In 1905, under the leadership of Carlos de Carvalho, São Paulo State Treasury bookkeeping tasks were introduced under a double-entry bookkeeping system and through accrual and financial accounting. Double-entry bookkeeping practices in the federal public accounting system, although enshrined in law since 1808, were only fully realized after the creation of the Double-entry Bookkeeping Committee in 1914. In that same year, due to the negotiation of a second funding loan, English creditor bank auditors requested a balance of the National Treasury from the Minister of Finance Rivadávia Corrêa. Because the balance had not been prepared in eight years, the Double-entry Bookkeeping Committee was established in June of 1914, and this body completed a technical <b>audit</b> <b>of</b> <b>Revenues</b> and Expenditures. The committee also conducted the state administration's first Asset and Liability audit since the colonial era. The Double-entry Bookkeeping Committee of 1914 spearheaded changes to the Brazilian public accounting system, including the creation of the Public Accounting Code in 1922 and the approval of Central Accounting Office of the Republic regulation in 1924, strengthening and ascribing perpetuity to practices adopted after 1914...|$|R

As {{a result of the}} increased percentage of taxpayers filing returns electronically, IRS designed a detailed business plan {{to reduce the number of}} service center campuses that process paper returns. In fiscal year 2004, Brookhaven became the first service center campus to downsize its submission processing function, leading to changes in its operations and a significant reduction in the volume of taxpayer receipts and information processed. Congress requested this review in light of these significant changes in operations and IRS's desire to benefit from the Brookhaven experience in planning for future submission processing rampdowns. Specifically, we were asked to (1) review the policies and procedures IRS developed to safeguard and process taxpayer receipts and information at the modified Brookhaven operation and (2) offer recommendations, if any, for improving internal controls at Brookhaven and at other submission processing centers that will undergo future rampdowns. To accommodate the request, we agreed to add a review of the mail control function at the Brookhaven service center campus to our tests of internal controls conducted as part <b>of</b> our <b>audit</b> <b>of</b> IRS's fiscal year 2004 financial statements. We have performed extensive work in reviewing internal controls designed to safeguard taxpayer receipts and information as part of our annual financial <b>audits</b> <b>of</b> IRS.
