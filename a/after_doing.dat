40|$|Two {{groups of}} 70 cows, {{including}} 51 identical twin sets, were grazed at either an unrestricted (14 kg dry matter intake/day; DMI/d) or restricted (6 kg DMI/d) daily pasture allowance {{for two weeks}} <b>after</b> drying off (<b>DO).</b> Incidence of new intramammary infection (IMI) and teat open/closed status was assessed at 7, 14 and 21 days <b>after</b> <b>DO.</b> Keratin plug formation was determined on a subset of 40 cows at 7 and 14 days <b>after</b> <b>DO.</b> Number of clinical mastitis (CM) cases and total new IMI did not differ between cows maintained on unrestricted or restricted DMI. However Streptococcus uberis was isolated from more new IMI in unrestricted animals than restricted animals (11. 7 % vs. 4. 6 % of quarters respectively; P < 0. 01). At 7 and 14 days <b>after</b> <b>DO,</b> more teats were classified as open in the unrestricted group compared to the restricted animals (57 % vs. 43 % of quarters respectively; P < 0. 01). However weight of keratin collected from teat canals did not differ between nutritional treatments. Results suggest that unrestricted nutrition <b>after</b> <b>DO</b> did not increase risk of CM but does increase risk of S. uberis infection...|$|R

It was while working at the base that she underwent a spiritual experience and subsequently further immersed herself in theosophical literature. <b>After</b> <b>doing</b> so, she became preoccupied by the idea of the 'Ascended Masters' or 'Secret Chiefs', claiming to have had visions of two such entities, the Master Jesus and the Master Rakoczi.|$|E
5|$|During the Apollo 11 launch, Armstrong's heart {{reached a}} top rate of 110 beats per minute. He {{found the first}} stage to be the loudest—much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch—and the Apollo CSM was {{relatively}} roomy compared to the Gemini capsule. This ability to move around was suspected to be the reason why none of the Apollo 11 crew suffered from space sickness, while members of previous crews did. Armstrong was especially happy, {{as he had been}} prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea <b>after</b> <b>doing</b> long periods of aerobatics.|$|E

At the start, Newman was the leader going through the first corner, but on the same lap Menard, with pushing assistance from Martin, passed him. On the second lap, the first caution was given because Newman spun sideways in the second turn but avoided impacting the wall. During the caution, he drove to pit road for a pit stop.|$|E

After the contract signing, EMI forwarded her a sizeable advance which she used to enroll in interpretive dance classes taught by Lindsay Kemp, a former teacher of David Bowie, and mime training with Adam Darius.|$|E

5|$|Intense Tropical Cyclone Kalunde was {{the strongest}} storm of the 2002–03 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. The {{eleventh}} named storm and sixth cyclone of the season, Kalunde formed on March4 from an area of disturbed weather east-southeast of Diego Garcia. The storm steadily strengthened and attained severe tropical storm intensity on March6. After starting a phase of rapid deepening, Kalunde attained cyclone intensity the next day. Kalunde attained its peak intensity on March 8, as an intense tropical cyclone. It maintained its peak strength for a day; shortly thereafter, the system began to weaken. After undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, the storm brushed Rodrigues. Shortly <b>after</b> <b>doing</b> so, Kalunde weakened into a tropical cyclone and later a severe tropical storm. Two days later, on March16, the cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated the next day.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} tumultuous primary {{election}} seasons ever began as the Tet Offensive was launched, followed by the withdrawal of President Johnson as a candidate <b>after</b> <b>doing</b> unexpectedly poorly in the New Hampshire primary; it concluded with the assassination {{of one of the}} Democratic candidates, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, just moments after his victory in the California primary. On the Republican side, Nixon's main opposition was Michigan Governor George Romney, though New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and California Governor Ronald Reagan each hoped to be nominated in a brokered convention. Nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot. He selected Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew as his running mate, a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party, appealing to both Northern moderates and Southerners disaffected with the Democrats.|$|E
5|$|The {{eighteenth century}} book {{consists}} {{of a collection of}} letters and essays written by Franklin. Most of the 25 letters in the collection were to Collinson. Some had personal content, but most were about his experiments with electricity and what he had observed from them. These talked about the conclusions he came to <b>after</b> <b>doing</b> scientific experimentation on Leyden jars and lightning storm clouds. He many times related the similarities of how each of these acted and that the principles they followed were identical. This connection ultimately led Franklin to the lightning rod and that the electricity could be diverted harmlessly away from houses and wooden buildings - making it a protection device.|$|E

5|$|The player gains {{points by}} {{defeating}} multiple enemies consecutively and {{can participate in}} a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass <b>after</b> <b>doing</b> this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has {{a certain number of}} enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing to maximum speed. Hitting a flipped enemy from underneath causes it to right itself and start moving again, but it does not change speed or color.|$|E
