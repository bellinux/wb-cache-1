5|$|Some Tremella species produce polysaccharides {{that are}} of {{interest}} to the medical field, because of their biological activity; several patents have been filed in China pertaining to the use of these compounds for cancer prevention or immune system enhancement. In 1966, Slodki reported discovering an acidic polysaccharide from haploid cells of T.mesenterica that closely resembled those produced by the species Cryptococcus laurentii. The structural similarity of the polysaccharides from the two species suggested a phylogenetic relationship between them. Subsequently, researchers chemically synthesized the polysaccharide, and determined the chemical identities of the component sugar units. The polysaccharide, known as glucuronoxylomannan—produced by fruit bodies and in pure culture conditions—has been shown to consist of a mannan backbone that is glycosylated with xylan chains in a regular repeating structure. Laboratory tests have associated a number of biological activities with T.mesenterica glucuronoxylomannan, including immunostimulatory, protecting against radiation, <b>antidiabetic,</b> anti-inflammatory, hypocholesterolemic, hepatoprotective, and antiallergic effects.|$|E

Data on patients with at least one prescription of oral <b>antidiabetics</b> in the period 2004 - 2006 were retrieved from the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD). Information on dispensation of statins in the same calendar year was also obtained. Long-term users of oral <b>antidiabetics</b> were defined as patients filling a prescription of these drugs the year prior to the year of observation. Results: In 2006, a total of 76 288 users of oral blood glucose-lowering drugs were registered as long-term users. 57. 0 % men and 49. 7 % women of long-term users received a statin. 15 646 patients were new users of oral <b>antidiabetics</b> in 2006. 45. 5 % men and 34. 9 % women of new users received a statin. The proportion of statin users increased with age and was higher in men than in women in all age groups. An absolute increase of 3 % from 2005 to 2006 was observed in the proportion of use of statins in both long-term users and new users of oral <b>antidiabetics.</b> Conclusions: In 2006, 54 % of long-term users and 40 % of new users of oral blood glucose-lowering drugs also received statins; these proportions were an increase from 2005.

We evaluated the extent of switching among equivalents in chronic cardiovascular therapies, {{the influence of the}} 2012 regulatory intervention and of patient-related or drug-related factors. Prescription of off-patent antiarrhythmics, oral <b>antidiabetics,</b> and ACE-inhibitors dispensed from August 2011 to August 2013 within the Bologna Local Health Authority (870, 000 inhabitants) were collected. The rate of actual switching among equivalents was evaluated monthly. The effect of the regulatory intervention was estimated by interrupted time series analysis. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of switching were calculated for: age, gender, number of different equivalents available for each drug, change in dispensing pharmacy between subsequent refills. The average monthly rates of switches were 9. 6 %, 16. 3 %, and 16. 3 % for antiarrhythmics, <b>antidiabetics,</b> and ACE-inhibitors, respectively. Values significantly increased soon after the regulatory intervention for ACE-inhibitors (+ 1. 81 %, p= 0. 00), antiarrhythmics (+ 1. 46 %, p= 0. 01) and <b>antidiabetics</b> (+ 1. 09 %, p= 0. 01), and no significant decreasing trends were observed in the following 12 months. For all drug classes, odd of switching was higher in case of change in dispensing pharmacy (up to aOR= 4. 31, 95 CI= 4. 26 - 4. 35 for ACE-inhibitors) and availability of ≥ 5 different equivalents (up to aOR= 7. 82, 95 CI= 7. 39 - 8. 28 for <b>antidiabetics).</b> Switching was lower for age ≥ 65 for <b>antidiabetics</b> and ACE-inhibitors (aOR= 0. 92, 95 CI= 0. 90 - 0. 93; 0. 87, 0. 86 - 0. 88, respectively).

5|$|<b>Antidiabetic</b> {{therapy has}} been {{proposed}} {{as a treatment for}} polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition frequently associated with insulin resistance, since the late 1980s. The use of metformin in PCOS was first reported in 1994, in a small study conducted at the University of the Andes, Venezuela. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for anovulation and infertility when other therapies fail to produce results. However, two clinical studies completed in 2006–2007 returned mostly negative results, with metformin performing no better than placebo, and a metformin-clomifene combination no better than clomifene alone. Reflecting this, subsequent reviews large randomized controlled trials in general have not shown the promise suggested by the early studies. UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend metformin as a first-line treatment or do not recommend it at all, except for women with glucose intolerance. The guidelines suggest clomiphene as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from the drug treatment.|$|E

40|$|Background: Non-adherence is a {{major public}} health problem. Despite {{the large amount of}} {{research}} in this area there is still need for research on determinants of non-adherente. For example, the influence of prescribers on adherence in their patient population is not clear. Objectives: 1) To identify risk profiles for non-adherence to oral <b>antidiabetics,</b> antihypertensives and antidepressants from patients' socio-demographic characteristics, frequency of GP consultation, and use of comedication 2) To explore variation in adherence rates between general practices. Methods: Data were obtained by linkage of a general practice to a dispensing database in 2001. We identified 3548 users for oral <b>antidiabetics,</b> 20004 for antihypertensives,and 7365 for antidepressants listed in 79 general practices. Adherence was defined as nuinber of days for which the drug was dispensed divided by number of days between start and theoretical end date in users with 3 + prescriptions. Compliance < 80 % was defined as non-adherence. Data were analyzed using multilevel models. Results: 7. 2 % af users of oral <b>antidiabetics</b> with 3 + prescriptions was non-adherent. For antihypertensives and antidepressant percentages were 11. 9 % and 25. 4 %. No correlates were found for adherence to <b>antidiabetics.</b> Native Dutch patients were more often adherent to antihypei-tensives (OR = 1. 6) and antidepressants (OR= 2. 1) than nonwestern immigrants. Type of inedication and complexity of medication regime were also correlated with adherence to these two drug groups. The proposition of adherent patients varied across genera 1 practices: for <b>antidiabetics</b> the range was 42 %, for antihypertensives 31 %, for antidepressants 32 %. This variation cannot be explained by differences in patient population. Moreover, general practices with a high proportion of adherent patients for one drug had higher proportions of adherent patients for the other drugs. Conclusions: We did not find clear risk profiles for nonadherence at the patient level. Our results show that risk profiles should include information on the patient's care provider. Future research should provide more insight into GP characteristics (f. e. cornmunication style) associated with their patients' adherence. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{possibility}} that variation in packaging and pill appearance may reduce adherence {{is a reason}} for concern, especially for chronic diseases. The objectives {{of the study were}} to quantify the extent of switches between generic <b>antidiabetics</b> and to verify whether switching between different products of the same substance affects adherence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All elderly residents of the Umbria Region who received at least 2 prescriptions of <b>antidiabetics</b> in 2010 and 2011 were included in the study. Switching was defined as the dispensing of two different products of the same substance in a series of two prescriptions. Single and multiple switchers were identified according to the number of switches during 2011. Switching relevant to the three off-patent substances with generic use ≥ 5 % (metformin, gliclazide and repaglinide) was quantified. The effect of switching on adherence, defined as the proportion of days in 2011 covered by prescriptions (Medication Possession Ratio, MPR), was estimated. RESULTS: Among the 15 964 patients receiving <b>antidiabetics</b> (14. 4 % of the elderly population) 9211 were prescribed {{at least one of the}} generic substances. Of these patients, 23. 3 % experienced a single switch and 15. 7 % were multiple switchers (61. 0 % never switched). The proportion of multiple switchers increased with the number of prescriptions, reaching 26 % among patients with ≥ 11 prescriptions. MPR was 62 %, 62 % and 72 %, respectively among non-switchers, single and multiple switchers. CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients treated with <b>antidiabetics,</b> the substitution between branded and unbranded products (as well as between generics) of the same substance, did not negatively affect adherence...|$|R
40|$|Background: Poor {{adherence}} to oral <b>antidiabetics</b> {{has a negative}} influence on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes patients. Real Time Medication Monitoring (RTMM) combines real time monitoring of patients’ medication use with SMS reminders sent only if patients forget their medication, aiming to improve adherence. This study aimed to investigate {{the effect of these}} SMS reminders on {{adherence to}} oral <b>antidiabetics</b> in patients using RTMM and investigate patients’ experiences with RTMM. Methods: Data were collected in a RCT involving 104 type 2 diabetes patients with suboptimal adherence to oral <b>antidiabetics.</b> Fifty-six patients were randomised to receive SMS reminders if they forgot their medication, 48 patients received no reminders. Primary outcome measure was adherence to oral <b>antidiabetics</b> registered with RTMM, measured as: (1) days without dosing; (2) missed doses; (3) doses taken within predefined standardized time windows. Patients’ experiences were assessed with written questionnaires. Results: Over the six-month study period, patients receiving SMS reminders took significantly more doses within predefined time windows than patients receiving no reminders: 50 % vs. 39 % within a 1 -h window p = 0. 003) up to 81 % vs. 70 % within a 4 -h window (p = 0. 007). Reminded patients tended to miss doses less frequently than patients not reminded (15 % vs. 19 %, p = 0. 065). Days without dosing were not significantly different between the groups. The majority of patients reported positive experiences with RTMM and SMS reminders. Conclusion: RTMM with SMS reminders improves adherence of type 2 diabetes patients, especially the precision with which patients follow their prescribed regimen, and is well accepted by patients.
