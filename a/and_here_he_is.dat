2500|$|Kokiden {{flew into}} a rage. [...] "A {{man out of}} favor with His Majesty is {{expected}} to have trouble feeding himself. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> living in a fine stylish house and saying awful things about all of us. No doubt the grovelers around him are assuring him that a deer is a horse.|$|E
2500|$|A.C. Grayling, {{writing in}} The Spectator, traces Superman's stances through the decades, from his 1930s {{campaign}} against crime being {{relevant to a}} nation {{under the influence of}} Al Capone, through the 1940s and World War II, a period in which Superman helped sell war bonds, and into the 1950s, where Superman explored the new technological threats. Grayling notes the period after the Cold War as being one where [...] "matters become merely personal: the task of pitting his brawn against the brains of Lex Luthor and Brainiac appeared to be independent of bigger questions", and discusses events post 9/11, stating that as a nation [...] "caught between the terrifying George W. Bush and the terrorist Osama bin Laden, America is in earnest need of a Saviour for everything from the minor inconveniences to the major horrors of world catastrophe. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> the down-home clean-cut boy in the blue tights and red cape".|$|E
6000|$|... "No surprise, dear," [...] {{he assured}} her, shaking his head. [...] "I knew the very hour that Richard left Wittenberg. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> by Jove!" ...|$|E
60|$|That threat {{had been}} uttered only yesterday, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in all {{probability}} late once more.|$|R
60|$|And he {{had come}} abroad {{to be rid of}} his repudiated {{daughter}} {{for the rest of his}} life. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fortinbras {{also appears}} in the 1964 BBC {{television}} Hamlet, starring Christopher Plummer, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> played by Donald Sutherland, in what was his first important role.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's that naughty boy. I {{told him}} to go to sleep alone, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> downstairs, getting his death a-cold pattering over that canvas," [...] said Meg, {{answering}} the call.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{saw him at}} the concert--I {{was sure}} it could be no other. I came in on purpose to find him, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> waiting for me. Is not it a happy chance?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That feller {{has a job}} in {{a machine}} shop over in Barrington, I seen him there when I was in the mills. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> tryin' to put us out--ain't that the limit?" ...|$|E
25|$|Escape always {{appealed to}} Dodge's mind, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> with good company. In {{addition}} to Day, {{also at the}} camp were the escape-obsessed Jimmy Buckley and Roger Bushell.|$|R
60|$|Oh yes, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> up. In fact, <b>he</b> had not <b>been</b> to bed. <b>He</b> {{had just}} come home. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> close {{following}} {{on the heels of}} the message.|$|R
60|$|This remark nearly {{took away}} my breath. I {{thought he would}} deny all {{knowledge}} of having ever known the merchant, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> mentioning {{the man at the}} very start.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look," [...] he said, {{twisting}} {{the head of}} his captive so that the glow fell on it. [...] "Look; I have the snake. Ah! Wife, you saw nothing, but I saw him, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> at last--at last!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hear that!' he cried. 'And I {{have seen}} a marquis here, a marquis, a marquis'--he {{repeated}} the holy word three times over--'and other persons high in society; and generals. And here, at your side, is this gentleman, who has been so many years in armies--decorated, an old warrior. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> ready to dedicate himself to God.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Velvet collar. Funny the {{old woman}} should have noticed the velvet collar. Dark blue {{overcoat}} with a velvet collar, she has told us. He was the chap she saw, and no mistake. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> all complete, velvet collar and all. I don’t think I missed a single piece {{as big as a}} postage stamp.” ...|$|E
60|$|But he went resolutely {{out to work}} again, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{chopping}} wood in old man Bacon's yard, thinking busily on the talk which had just passed between Marietta and himself.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the captain}} was taken {{to another part of}} the glade, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> made a close {{prisoner}} by being bound, hands and feet, to the trunk of a blasted tree.|$|R
5000|$|Life in the {{political}} fast lane did not resume, however: Merker was sent {{to live in a}} small town called Luckenwalde, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> given an [...] "HO" [...] restaurant to run.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hear that!" [...] he cried. [...] "And I {{have seen}} a marquis here, a marquis, a marquis"--he {{repeated}} the holy word three times over--"and other persons high in society; and generals. And here, at your side, is this gentleman, who has been so many years in armies--decorated, an old warrior. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> ready to dedicate himself to God." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is of no}} use," [...] Ben Soloman said in his own language. [...] "The fellow {{is still}} insensible. The clumsy fool who hit him would fare badly, if I knew who he was. I {{said that he was}} to be knocked down, silenced, and brought here; <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> of no more use than if he were dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] he said, {{advancing}} {{to the foot of}} the bed; [...] "I call on you all to observe the nature of this whole transaction. My poor, beloved, but misled uncle, no longer ago than last night, was struck with a fit of apoplexy, or something so very near it as to disqualify him to judge in these matters; <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> urged to make a will--" ...|$|E
6000|$|But the squire had not died, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{again at}} Tretton as the squire's guest. [...] "I think," [...] said Mr. Grey, [...] "that the less said about {{a good deal}} of it the better." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1983 {{he became}} Italian Formula Three champion, after {{dominating}} the series with nine victories. After that {{he moved with}} the Coloni team to the European Formula Three Championship, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the champion again in 1984.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> {{educated at}} Harrow and later won an {{exhibition}} to Christ Church, Oxford <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> amused that his tutor put {{down on his}} list as required reading Burke's Peerage. His grandfather, Herbert Jackson-Stops, founded the eponymous and up-market estate agency.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are incorrigible, Bathurst. Miss Hannay, I {{warn you}} that {{this man is a}} monomaniac. I drag him away from his work, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> discoursing with you on reform just as a race is going to start. You may imagine, my dear, what a thorn he is {{in the side of the}} bigwigs. You have heard of Talleyrand's advice to a young official, 'Above all things, no zeal.' Go away, Bathurst; Miss Hannay wants to see the race, and even if she doesn't she is {{powerless}} to assist you in your crusade." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not she, sir. She {{came out}} from behind Blok, and a craft of her size that {{wanted to go to}} the westward, and which found itself so close in, would have taken the first of the flood and gone through the Race like a shot. No, no, Captain Gar'ner; this fellow is bound south as well as ourselves, and it is quite onaccountable how he should be just where he is--so far to windward, or so far to leeward, as a body might say. A {{south-south-east}} course, from any place behind Point Judith, would have taken him off near No Man's Land, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> almost in a line with Blok Island!" ...|$|E
60|$|Jordan, in {{the course}} of his Tour, came to {{composure}} on several points. He found that, by frugality, by wise management of some peculium already his, his little Daughter and he might have quietness at Berlin, and the necessary food and raiment;--and, on the whole, that he would altogether cease preaching, and settle down there, among his Books, in a frugal manner. Which he did;--and was living so, when the Prince, searching for that kind of person, got tidings of him. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> at Reinsberg; bustling about, in a brisk, modestly frank and cheerful manner: well liked by everybody; by his Master very well and ever better, who grew into real regard, esteem and even friendship for him, and has much Correspondence, of a freer kind than is common to him, with little Jordan, so long as they lived together. Jordan's death, ten years hence, was probably the one considerable pain he had ever given his neighbors, in this the ultimate section of his life.|$|E
60|$|Miss Sampson {{had heard}} {{of him and his}} record, and she could not help a paleness, a shrinking, which, however, he did not appear to notice. Sally had been dying to meet a real rustler, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> a very prince of rascals.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Dolly, he's a found child, {{and never}} had no father or mother that ever was heard of. We had him from the work'us when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> seven, to chop mangel wurzel, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he's</b> <b>been</b> ever since, nigh twelve year. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> Bill there, and he's Bill here." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{an instant}} they paused, paralyzed by {{the wonder of}} the thing. It was Manu, the monkey, Manu, the little coward, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> daring the ferocity of the great Mangani, hopping about upon the carcass of Numa, the lion, and crying out that they must not strike it again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, let me see," [...] began Mr. Joe, whose {{narrative}} {{powers were}} not great. [...] "He is a bookkeeper in my Uncle Josh Loring's importing concern, {{and a powerful}} smart man, they say. There's some kind of clever story about his father's leaving a load of debts, and Frank's working a deused number of years till they were paid. Good of him, wasn't it? Then, {{just as he was}} going to take things easier and enjoy life a bit, his mother died, and that rather knocked him up, you see. He fell sick, and came to grief generally, Uncle Josh said; so he was ordered off to get righted, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> looking like a tombstone. I've a regard for Frank, for he took care of me through the smallpox a year ago, and I don't forget things of that sort; so, if you wish to be introduced, Mrs. Carroll, I'll trot him out with pleasure, and make a proud man of him." ...|$|E
60|$|There is one consolatory reflection. Every abuse {{carries with}} it its own remedy or palliation. Thus the excess of crude and hasty criticism, which has of late prevailed {{throughout}} the literary world, and threatened to overrun our country, begins to produce its own antidote. Where there is a multiplicity of contradictory paths, a man must make his choice; in so doing, he has to exercise his judgment, {{and that is one}} great step to mental independence. He begins to doubt all, where all differ, and but one can be in the right. He is driven to trust to his own discernment, and his natural feelings; <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> most likely to be safe. The author, too, finding that what is condemned at one tribunal, is applauded at another, though perplexed for a time, gives way at length to the spontaneous impulse of his genius, and the dictates of his taste, and writes in the way most natural to himself. It is thus that criticism, which by its severity may have held the little world of writers in check, may, by its very excess, disarm itself of its terrors, and the hardihood of talent become restored.|$|E
60|$|Things, you see, have jarred a little, {{and they}} ride {{on their way}} {{together}} with a certain aloofness of manner that promises ill for the orthodox development of the Adventure. He perceives he was too precipitate. But he feels his honour is involved, and meditates {{the development of a}} new attack. And the girl? She is unawakened. Her motives are bookish, written by a haphazard syndicate of authors, novelists, and biographers, on her white inexperience. An artificial oversoul she is, that may presently break down and reveal a human being beneath it. She is still in that schoolgirl phase when a talkative old man is more interesting than a tongue-tied young one, and when to be an eminent mathematician, say, or to edit a daily paper, seems as fine an ambition as any girl need aspire to. Bechaniel was to have helped her to attain that in the most expeditious manner, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> beside her, talking enigmatical phrases about passion, looking at her with the oddest expression, and once, and that was his gravest offence, offering to kiss her. At any rate he has apologised. She still scarcely realises, you see, the scrape she has got into.|$|E
60|$|But her {{goodness}} and her courage had saved him, for <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a christened knight, {{and not a}} man of the fairy world. And he had taken his own form again beneath her hand, when she signed him with the Cross, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> safe <b>and</b> happy, at home at Fairnilee.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, this is {{a pretty}} warm {{reception}} for a poor lone wolf from the Arctic," [...] the master said, while White Fang calmed down under his caressing hand. [...] "In all his life <b>he's</b> only <b>been</b> known once to go off his feet, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he's</b> <b>been</b> rolled twice in thirty seconds." ...|$|R
50|$|Gijsbrechts came to Denmark at {{the latest}} in 1668, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> hired as court artist by the autocratic Danish king Frederik III from 1668-70, and {{hereafter}} by Christian V from 1670-72. He had his studio in The Royal Garden by Rosenborg Castle and from 1670 he called himself Court painter.|$|R
