5|$|The film's {{animation}} {{was created}} by then-unknown animator John Muto. Because of the film's low budget, Muto created all of the film's animation sequences himself. Muto made frequent use of <b>airbrush</b> techniques to establish for himself a distinctive style. For sequences in which live-action and animation were combined, the actors were photographed in tight head-on and profile shots, and the photos were cut out and pasted into the animation in a style recalling Terry Gilliam's work on Monty Python's Flying Circus. Muto also credits The Fleischer Brothers as another inspiration.|$|E
5|$|When {{drawing the}} characters, Kishimoto {{consistently}} follows a five-step process: concept and rough sketch, drafting, inking, shading, and coloring. These steps are followed {{when he is}} drawing the manga and making the color illustrations that commonly adorn the cover of tankōbon, {{the cover of the}} Weekly Shōnen Jump, or other media, but the toolkit he uses occasionally changes. For instance, he used an <b>airbrush</b> for one illustration for a Weekly Shōnen Jump cover, but decided not to use it for future drawings largely due to the cleanup required.|$|E
25|$|<b>Airbrush</b> {{technique}} is the freehand {{manipulation of the}} <b>airbrush,</b> medium, air pressure and distance from the surface being sprayed {{in order to produce}} a certain predictable result on a consistent basis with or without shields or stencils. <b>Airbrush</b> technique will differ with the type of <b>airbrush</b> being used (single-action or dual/double-action).|$|E

50|$|In <b>airbrushing,</b> a frisket is {{a plastic}} sheet with an {{adhesive}} backing used {{to mask off}} specific areas of an image so that only the exposed area is covered with paint. The frisket is vital to <b>airbrushing,</b> because it allows the artist to control excess paint spray, create special effects, achieve extreme precision, control edge attributes and to expedite the <b>airbrushing</b> process.|$|R
30|$|We {{present a}} facile and {{scalable}} coating method based on controlled <b>airbrushing,</b> which {{is suitable for}} conformal resin coating in continuous roll-to-roll (R 2 R) nanoimprint lithography (NIL) process. By controlling the concentration of UV-curable polymeric resin with mixing the volatile solvent and its <b>airbrushing</b> time, the coated resin film thickness can be readily tuned. After R 2 R NIL using a flexible nanoscale line pattern (nanograting) mold is conducted upon the <b>airbrushed</b> resin film, a large-area uniform nanograting pattern is fabricated with controlled residual layer thickness (RLT) based on the initial film thickness. We investigate the faithful <b>airbrushing</b> condition that can reliably create the uniform thin films as well as various nanopatterns with controlled morphologies. Using more diluted resin and shorter <b>airbrushing</b> time can reduce the RLTs favourably for many applications, yet is apt to induce the nanoscale pores and discontinued lines. We also discuss how to further improve the quality and scalability of resin <b>airbrushing</b> and its potential applications particularly requiring high-speed and conformal coating on highly topographic and flexible surfaces.|$|R
25|$|An <b>airbrush</b> is a small, {{air-operated}} {{tool that}} sprays various media including ink and dye, but most often paint {{by a process}} of nebulization. Spray guns developed from the <b>airbrush</b> and are still considered a type of <b>airbrush.</b> The first <b>airbrush</b> was invented in 1876 by Francis Edgar Stanley of Newton, Massachusetts.|$|E

30|$|Not {{only to the}} RLT-controllable resin coating for R 2 R NIL {{and simple}} planar thin film fabrication, can the <b>airbrushing</b> method also be {{applicable}} to more specific uses and broader materials. As the microscale droplets out of an <b>airbrusher</b> nozzle can smoothly reflow along the surface topography [12], <b>airbrushing</b> further enables the conformal coating over the surfaces especially with large surface roughness, which otherwise demands special treatments in ordinary spin coating or drop casting. By <b>airbrushing,</b> many functional materials can be conformally coated on highly topographic and flexible surfaces, including photoresists [21], anti-sticking agents [22], and active layers in flexible photovoltaic cells [23 – 25].|$|R
30|$|To this end, {{we present}} a facile, rapid, and {{scalable}} resin coating protocol by utilizing a controlled <b>airbrushing</b> technique. A UV-curable polymeric resin is diluted in a volatile solvent for smooth flowing, which is <b>airbrushed</b> over the substrate to leave a uniform thin resin film behind. This quick process is well-suited to the continuous and high-speed R 2 R NIL; we first review that a uniform nanoscale line (nanograting) pattern can be faithfully fabricated by conducting R 2 R NIL with a flexible nanograting mold onto the <b>airbrushed</b> resin films based on our previous work [12]. By modulating the resin concentration and <b>airbrushing</b> time, the initial thin film thickness {{as well as the}} residual layer thickness (RLT) of the nanopatterns created by R 2 R NIL can be readily controlled. We systematically investigate the parametric effects of the <b>airbrushing</b> process on the resulting nanopattern quality in our experimental space; reducing resin concentration and <b>airbrushing</b> time can lead to thinner RLTs usually favorable in most applications, yet is prone to cause the nanoscale pores and discontinued lines due to solvent evaporation and/or insufficient resin. We also discuss how to further improve the quality and scalability along with the potential applications that can benefit from the <b>airbrushing</b> and other extended large-area coating methodology such as the doctor blade coating.|$|R

30|$|In summary, we {{introduce}} the <b>airbrushing</b> method for conformal and high-speed coating of functional polymers and demonstrate its application in continuous and scalable R 2 R NIL with controlled RLTs and further potential uses. The polymer film thickness {{as well as}} the surface morphology and profile can be modulated by regulating the concentration of UV-curable polymeric resin with mixing the volatile solvent and its <b>airbrushing</b> time. Using more diluted resin and shorter <b>airbrushing</b> time can reduce the RLTs favourably for many applications, while generating the surficial nanopores and/or dewetting-driven fragments upon UV curing. <b>Airbrushing</b> can be practically applied to many unique applications by enabling the conformal coating over the highly topographic and flexible surfaces at high speed, including but not limited to various functional coatings, electronics, and energy conversion devices.|$|R
