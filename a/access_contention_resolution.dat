In particular, we assume that SUs exploit spectrum holes {{on a set of}} channels where each SU can use at most one available channel for communication. We present the optimal brute-force search algorithm to solve the corresponding nonlinear integer optimization problem and analyze its complexity. Because the optimal solution has exponential complexity with the numbers of channels and SUs, we develop two low-complexity channel assignment algorithms that can efficiently utilize the spectrum holes. In the first algorithm, SUs are assigned distinct sets of channels. We show that this algorithm achieves the maximum throughput limit if the number of channels is sufficiently large. In addition, we propose an overlapping channel assignment algorithm that can improve the throughput performance compared with its nonoverlapping channel assignment counterpart. Moreover, we design a distributed medium access control (MAC) protocol for <b>access</b> <b>contention</b> <b>resolution</b> and integrate it into the overlapping channel assignment algorithm. We then analyze the saturation throughput and the complexity of the proposed channel assignment algorithms. We also present several potential extensions, including the development of greedy channel assignment algorithms under the max-min fairness criterion and throughput analysis, considering sensing errors.

For the optical-core network, we present {{the architecture of}} an optical router to achieve <b>contention</b> <b>resolution</b> in wavelength, time, and space domains. Complementing the solution involving only the core router intelligences, we propose performance enhancement schemes at the network edge, including a traffic-shaping function at the ingress edge and a proper dimensioning of the drop port number at the egress edge. Both schemes prove effective in reducing networkwide packet-loss rates. In particular, scalability performance simulations demonstrate that a considerably low packet-loss rate (0. 0001 % at load 0. 6) is achieved in a 16 -wavelength network by incorporating the performance enhancement schemes at the edge with the <b>contention</b> <b>resolution</b> schemes in the core.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{the number of}} {{wireless}} communications users is increasing at an unprecedented rate. However, limited radio resources must accommodate {{the increasing number of}} users. Hence, the efficient use of radio spectrum is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. In order to improve the spectral efficiency for the wireless communication networks, we investigate two promising technologies, the relaying and the multiple access schemes. In the physical (PHY) layer of the open systems interconnect (OSI) model, the relaying schemes are capable to improve the transmission reliability and expand transmission coverage via cooperative communications by using relay nodes. Hence, the two-way relay network (TWRN), a cooperative communications network, is investigated {{in the first part of}} the thesis. In the media access control (MAC) layer of the OSI model, the multiple access schemes are able to schedule multiple transmissions by efficiently allocating limited radio resources. As a result, the contention-based multiple <b>access</b> schemes for <b>contention</b> <b>resolution</b> are explored in the second part of the thesis. In the first part of the thesis, the channel estimation for the two-way relay networks (TWRNs) is investigated. Firstly, the channel estimation issue is considered under the assumption of the perfect synchronisation. Then, the channel estimation is conducted, by relaxing the assumption of perfect synchronisation. Another challenge facing the wireless communication systems is the contention and interference due to multiple transmissions from multiple nodes, sharing the common communication medium. To improve the spectral efficiency in the media access control layer, a self-adaptive backoff (SAB) algorithm is proposed to resolve contention in the contention-based multiple access networks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper revisits burst <b>contention</b> <b>resolution</b> {{problems}} in optical burst switching (OBS) networks {{from the viewpoint}} of network utility maximization. Burst collision occurs when two or more bursts access the same wavelength simultaneously, and the occurrence becomes more frequent as the offered load increases. In particular, when the network is overloaded, no <b>contention</b> <b>resolution</b> scheme would effectively avoid the collision without the help of congestion control. We formulate a joint optimization problem where two variables, the length and the time at which each burst is injected into the network, are jointly optimized in order to maximize aggregate utility while minimizing burst loss. A distributed algorithm is also developed, which explicitly reveals how burst <b>contention</b> <b>resolution</b> and congestion control must interact. The simulation results show that the joint control decouples throughput performance from burst loss performance so that burst loss ratio does not increase as network throughput increases. This is not the case in conventional <b>contention</b> <b>resolution</b> schemes where burst loss ratio increases as network throughput increases so that achievable network throughput is limited. Our work is the first attempt to the joint design of congestion and contention control and might lead to an interesting development in OBS research.
