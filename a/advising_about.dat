6000|$|When {{the lords}} and princes {{of the pit}} saw the flaming desire that was in Diabolus to devour the miserable town of Mansoul, they left off to raise any more objections, but consented to lend him what {{strength}} they could, though had Apollyon's advice been taken, they had far more fearfully distressed the town of Mansoul. But, I say, {{they were willing to}} lend him what strength they could, not knowing what need they might have of him, when they should engage for themselves, as he. Wherefore they fell to <b>advising</b> <b>about</b> the next thing propounded, namely, what soldiers they were, and also how many, with whom Diabolus should go against the town of Mansoul to take it; and after some debate, it was concluded, according as in the letter the Diabolonians had suggested, that none were more fit for that expedition than an army of terrible doubters. They therefore concluded to send against Mansoul an army of sturdy doubters. The number thought fit to be employed in that service was between twenty and thirty thousand. So then the result of that great council of those high and mighty lords was--That Diabolus should even now, out of hand, beat up his drum for men in the land of Doubting, which land lieth upon the confines of the place called Hell-Gate Hill, for men that might be employed by him against the miserable town of Mansoul. It was also concluded, that these lords themselves should help him in the war, and that they would to that end head and manage his men. So they drew up a letter, and sent back to the Diabolonians that lurked in Mansoul, and that waited for the back-coming of Mr. Profane, to signify to them into what method and forwardness they at present had put their design.

40|$|Approximately 38 {{percent of}} American adults used {{complementary}} and alternative medicine (CAM) in 2007. Despite {{the popularity of}} CAM therapies and inquiries to pharmacists regarding these therapies, pharmacists do not feel they are well-equipped to handle patient 2 ̆ 7 s questions regarding CAM. Although some studies have assessed pharmacists 2 ̆ 7 attitudes and professional behaviors towards CAM, fewer studies have examined pharmacy students 2 ̆ 7 attitudes towards CAM. This study had two main research questions: 1) what are U. S. pharmacy students 2 ̆ 7 attitudes towards CAM and 2) how may these attitudes impact their intention to advise patients about various CAM therapies as future pharmacists? The objectives were to: 1) explore pharmacy students 2 ̆ 7 attitudes towards CAM, the factors that may be influencing these attitudes, as well as pharmacy students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions towards <b>advising</b> <b>about</b> CAM {{in the context of}} the theory of planned behavior (TPB), 2) assess differences in pharmacy students 2 ̆ 7 attitudes towards CAM by demographic characteristics, 3) examine the relationship between attitudes towards CAM and attitudes towards <b>advising</b> <b>about</b> CAM and 4) examine the components of the TPB (attitudes towards <b>advising</b> <b>about</b> CAM, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control) in predicting pharmacy students 2 ̆ 7 intentions to advise about CAM as future pharmacists. ^ To address these objectives, a 73 -item questionnaire was developed and distributed using Qualtrics Survey Software to first, second, and third professional year pharmacy students in seven colleges/schools of pharmacy across the United States. Statistical analyses to assess the data included means, frequencies, One-Way ANOVA, Bonferroni corrections, two sample t-tests, Pearson correlations, and multiple regression.

40|$|The data {{collected}} in the Australian Register of antiepileptic drugs in pregnancy have been studied {{in the hope of}} defining simple items of information that could be recorded at initial interview of pregnant women with epilepsy, and which might allow estimation of the risk of the pregnancy resulting in a malformed foetus. Analysis of the data showed that dose of valproate, but not intake of other commonly used antiepileptic drugs, in the current pregnancy, and a past history of a pregnancy involving a malformed foetus, statistically significantly increased the malformation hazard in the current pregnancy, and that continuing alcohol intake might decrease it. Plotting the hazard against valproate dose in monotherapy, with or without histories of (i) previous pregnancies with foetal malformations (FMs), and (ii) continuing alcohol intake, provided quantitative information concerning the degree of increased risk. It is hoped that this information may help in <b>advising</b> <b>about</b> the risk of foetal malformation (FM) in individual pregnancies...|$|E
