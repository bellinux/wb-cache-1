50|$|Verification of {{machinery}} and equipment usually consists of design qualification (DQ), installation qualification (IQ), operational qualification (OQ), and performance qualification (PQ). DQ may be performed by a vendor or by the user, by confirming through review and testing that the equipment meets the written acquisition specification. If the relevant document or manuals {{of machinery}}/equipment are provided by vendors, the later 3Q needs to be thoroughly performed by the users who work in an industrial regulatory environment. Otherwise, the process of IQ, OQ and PQ is the task of validation. The typical {{example of such a}} case could be the loss or absence of vendor's documentation for legacy equipment or do-it-yourself (DIY) assemblies (e.g., cars, computers etc.) and, therefore, users should endeavour to acquire DQ document beforehand. Each template of DQ, IQ, OQ and PQ usually {{can be found on the}} internet respectively, whereas the DIY qualifications of machinery/equipment can be assisted either by the vendor's training course materials and tutorials, or by the published guidance books, such as step-by-step series if the acquisition of machinery/equipment is not bundled with on- site qualification services. This kind of the DIY approach is also applicable to the qualifications of software, computer operating systems and a manufacturing process. The most important and critical task as the last step of the activity is to generating and archiving machinery/equipment qualification reports for <b>auditing</b> <b>purposes,</b> if regulatory compliances are mandatory.|$|E

The method uses an indicator approach within a protocol loosely inspired by International Standards Organization procedures.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesPolysemy is a {{frequent}} issue in biomedical terminologies. In the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), polysemous terms are either represented as several independent concepts, or clustered into a single, multiply-categorized concept. The objective {{of this study is}} to analyze polysemous concepts in the UMLS through their categorization and hierarchical relations for <b>auditing</b> <b>purposes.</b> MethodsWe used the association of a concept with multiple Semantic Groups (SGs) as a surrogate for polysemy. We first extracted multi-SG (MSG) concepts from the UMLS Metathesaurus and characterized them in terms of the combinations of SGs with which they are associated. We then clustered MSG concepts in order to identify major types of polysemy. We also analyzed the inheritance of SGs in MSG concepts. Finally, we manually reviewed the categorization of the MSG concepts for <b>auditing</b> <b>purposes.</b> ResultsThe 1208 MSG concepts in the Metathesaurus are associated with 30 distinct pairs of SGs. We created 75 semantically homogeneous clusters of MSG concepts, and 276 MSG concepts could not be clustered for lack of hierarchical relations. The clusters were characterized by the most frequent pairs of semantic types of their constituent MSG concepts. MSG concepts exhibit limited semantic compatibility with their parent and child concepts. A large majority of MSG concepts (92 %) are adequately categorized. Examples of miscategorized concepts are presented. ConclusionThis work is a systematic analysis and manual review of all concepts categorized by multiple SGs in the UMLS. The correctly-categorized MSG concepts do reflect polysemy in the UMLS Metathesaurus. The analysis of inheritance of SGs proved useful for auditing concept categorization in the UMLS...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{has been}} {{considerable}} investment by health {{authorities in the}} funding of support staff {{whose job is to}} collect data for <b>audit</b> <b>purposes.</b> It is important to understand what costs are involved in such a data collection exercise. The cost advantages of using existing practice staff or externally funded staff are not known. AIM: To assess the cost of transposing data on workload to computer software for <b>audit</b> <b>purposes</b> and retrieving data on five chronic diseases from case records. METHOD: Four audit support staff monitored the time taken to collect specific data as part of a broad audit programme in 12 training practices within one health board area in the West of Scotland in 1997. The time taken was used to estimate comparative costs for using a receptionist or practice nurse for carrying out a similar exercise. RESULTS: Average costs for collecting data per 1000 patients for waiting time, appointments, recall, and telephone audits were 5. 24 Pounds for reception staff, 5. 64 Pounds for audit support staff, and 9. 68 Pounds for a practice nurse. The average cost for collecting data per patient with diabetes, asthma, epilepsy, hypertension, or rheumatoid arthritis was 1. 48 Pounds for reception staff, 1. 60 Pounds for audit support staff, and 2. 74 Pounds for a practice nurse. CONCLUSIONS: The cost of collecting data varies considerably depending on which staff are chosen for the purpose. Practices should consider carefully how best to collect data for audit in terms of cost...|$|R
