5|$|He was a {{relative}} late-comer to competitive running: {{in his late}} teens, scouts from a local athletics club suggested that his cycling stamina might translate to running and invited him to compete. He won the race and was spurred on by the victory to start taking the sport seriously and focus on running. Zersenay was <b>adamant</b> <b>that</b> his early years in cycling {{had given him a}} firm foundation for endurance running.|$|E
5|$|Asa Gray (November 18, 1810 – January 30, 1888) is {{considered}} the most important American botanist of the 19thcentury. His Darwiniana was considered an important explanation of how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive. Gray was <b>adamant</b> <b>that</b> a genetic connection must exist between all members of a species. He was also strongly opposed to the ideas of hybridization within one generation and special creation {{in the sense of}} its not allowing for evolution, as he felt evolution was guided by a Creator.|$|E
5|$|Despite these setbacks, Simonds was <b>adamant</b> <b>that</b> Verrières Ridge {{should be}} taken and sent in the Black Watch and the Calgary Highlanders to {{stabilise}} the precarious Allied position. Minor counterattacks by both battalions on 21 July managed to contain Dietrich's armoured formations {{and by the time}} the operation was called off, Canadian forces held several footholds on the ridge, including a now secure position on Point67. Four German divisions still held the ridge. In all, the actions around Verrières Ridge during Operation Atlantic accounted for over 1,300 Allied casualties.|$|E

50|$|Despite his jealousy of Ritsuka's close {{friendship}} with Yuiko, he is encouraged by Ritsuka's <b>adamant</b> claims <b>that</b> their relationship is purely platonic. He makes a firm statement {{he will not}} give up on Yuiko, and spends {{more time with her}} than ever.|$|R
5|$|In the end, Jon and Sansa {{are only}} able to recruit {{a small number of}} minor houses, only adding a few hundred extra {{soldiers}} to their army. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Jon is <b>adamant</b> <b>that</b> they attack Winterfell as soon as possible before the Boltons rally more forces and before the weather turns on them. Sansa disagrees, insisting that they try and recruit more houses. When Jon refuses to change his mind, Sansa begins writing a letter to be sent by raven.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{explained}} that he instantly liked the song, but listened to it twice before making his final decision. Although the song was written by Kelly, Jackson was <b>adamant</b> <b>that</b> the production should be a collaborative effort amongst the two musicians. The tape sent to him had no harmony or modulations, so Jackson added a choir in the final portion and added a sense of climax and structure to the final piece. The song has a tempo of 60 beats per minute, {{making it one of}} Jackson's slowest songs.|$|E
5|$|Their debut studio album, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., was {{recorded}} over three daytime sessions in March 1964 and released in October. The album contains four original Simon compositions, {{with the remainder}} consisting of three traditional folk songs and five folk-influenced singer-songwriter numbers. Simon was <b>adamant</b> <b>that</b> they would no longer use stage names, and they adopted the name Simon & Garfunkel. Columbia set up a promotional showcase at Folk City on March 31, 1964, the duo's first public concert as Simon & Garfunkel. The showcase, {{as well as other}} scheduled performances, did not go well.|$|E
50|$|Despite his known republicanism, in an {{interview}} with Prachatai, he toned down his stance, expressing his admiration for the monarchy as a historical institution and a medium for national unity.

5|$|As {{they travel}} together, Natalie {{questions}} Ryan's philosophies on life, particularly on relationships and love, but Ryan is <b>adamant</b> <b>that</b> {{he is more}} than happy with his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie is shattered when her boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by text message, and Ryan and Alex try to comfort her. Natalie later lectures Ryan about his refusal to consider a commitment to Alex {{in spite of their}} obvious compatibility, and becomes infuriated; she apologizes later, but soon afterward they are both ordered back to Omaha to implement Natalie's program. On the test run, the earlier concerns Ryan raised prove valid; one laid-off person breaks down in tears before the camera, and Natalie is unable to comfort him.|$|E
5|$|Before the Beatles {{achieved}} nationwide {{success in}} Britain, Epstein had permitted {{a small company}} (run by his cousins, and which initially catered only to fan club members) to produce Beatles' sweaters for 30 shillings and badges for six pence, eventually selling 15,000 sweaters and 50,000 badges as the Beatles' popularity grew. When Beatlemania stormed the UK in 1963, Epstein was besieged by novelty goods companies wanting to use The Beatles' name and images on plastic guitars, drums, disc racks, badges, belts and a huge variety of assorted merchandise. Epstein was <b>adamant</b> <b>that</b> the Beatles would not directly endorse any product, but through NEMS Enterprises he would grant discretionary licences to companies {{who were able to}} produce a quality product at a fair price, although many companies were already selling products without a licence.|$|E
5|$|Charles VI's uncle, Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, {{thought the}} {{proposed}} marriage ideal {{to build an}} alliance with the Holy Roman Empire and against the English. Isabeau's father agreed reluctantly and sent her to France with his brother, her uncle, on the pretext of taking a pilgrimage to Amiens. He was <b>adamant</b> <b>that</b> she was not to know she was being sent to France to be examined as a prospective bride for Charles, and refused permission {{for her to be}} examined in the nude, customary at the time. According to the contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart, Isabeau was 13 or 14 when the match was proposed and about 16 {{at the time of the}} marriage in 1385, suggesting a birth date of around 1370.|$|E
50|$|In 1941 the US Navy {{requested}} a better-performing carrier-based fighter plane, {{to be powered}} by the proposed high performance 24-cylinder liquid cooled Lycoming XH-2470 Hyper engine.

5000|$|Lionel Robbins {{reported}} that [...] "it {{would be difficult}} to exaggerate the electrifying effect on thought throughout the whole relevant apparatus of government ... nothing so imaginative and so ambitious had ever been discussed". However, Harry Dexter White, representing the United States, which was the world's biggest creditor, said [...] "We have been perfectly <b>adamant</b> on <b>that</b> point. We have taken the position of absolutely no." ...|$|R
5|$|Critics commented {{upon the}} character's {{resemblance}} both to horror film killers such as Freddy Krueger and Hannibal Lecter, {{as well as}} to American Evangelists and to the biblical Jesus Christ. The series also follows Danes' rise and fall in the public eye and the precariousness of fame. Though critics questioned the wisdom of having a pedophile as a character, the show's creative team was <b>adamant</b> <b>that</b> they had deliberately made him unlikable. In killing the character off, the creative team did not wish to suggest that the character had been redeemed for his earlier crimes, and made sure that this was emphasised even in his final act of self-sacrifice. Pullman has expressed interest in reprising the role in a future Torchwood series.|$|E
5|$|For La belle Hélène, Offenbach secured Hortense Schneider to {{play the}} title role. Since her early success in his short operas, {{she had become a}} leading star of the French musical stage. She now {{commanded}} large fees and was notoriously temperamental, but Offenbach was <b>adamant</b> <b>that</b> no other singer could match her as Hélène. Rehearsals for the premiere at the Théâtre des Variétés were tempestuous, with Schneider and the principal mezzo-soprano feuding, the censor fretting about the satire of the imperial court, and the manager of the theatre attempting to rein in Offenbach's extravagance with production expenses. Once again the success of the piece was inadvertently assured by the critic Janin; his scandalised notice was strongly countered by liberal critics and the ensuing publicity again brought the public flocking.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, a young Native American man {{is forced}} by several others to ingest snake venom. The venom causes him to hallucinate, {{and one of}} the men, Joe Reynard (Michael Greyeyes) asks him to {{describe}} his visions. However, the poisoned man screams in agony and dies. His body is later found when a construction site is being excavated by archaeologists.

As the hour strikes, she tears herself away from him.|$|R
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to The Man from London {{was generally}} positive, though less <b>adamant</b> than <b>that</b> of the director's previous two works; while reviewers spoke in glowing {{terms of the}} formidable cinematography and meticulous composition, they felt the film lacked compelling characters. Variety reviewer Derek Elley commented that the film was unlikely to reconcile the division between viewers of Tarr's films who find the director to be [...] "either a visionary genius or a crashing bore".|$|R
5000|$|After the {{announcement}} of the discontinuation of Toobs in 2015, there was public outcry. Sports celebrity Shane Warne attempted to start a campaign on Twitter to bring back Toobs using hashtags #BringBackToobs and #savetoobs. However, the company was <b>adamant,</b> noting <b>that</b> despite the sentiment, actual sales were the issue: Smith's Consumer Information Centre stated that [...] "Consumer demand for the tangy, tomatoey treat has declined and it is no longer possible to justify on-going production." ...|$|R
5|$|In a troop {{movement}} that took all {{night on a}} makeshift raft, the Texian army crossed Buffalo Bayou at Lynchburg April 19 with 930 soldiers, leaving behind 255 others as guards or for reasons of illness. The idea had been floated of leaving the Twin Sisters behind as protection, but Neill was <b>adamant</b> <b>that</b> the cannons be taken into the battle. In an April 20 skirmish {{the day before the}} main battle Neill was severely wounded, and George Hockley took command of the heavy artillery. Estimates of the Mexican army troop strength {{on the day of the}} main battle range from 1,250 to 1,500.|$|E
5|$|Judah fought WBA (Super) {{champion}} Amir Khan in a unification bout on July 23, 2011 at Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino, Las Vegas. Judah {{was knocked}} out by Khan in the 5th round after Khan landed an uppercut body shot. Judah was unable to answer the referee's 10 count, thus recording his 7th career loss. Khan was ahead 40-36 on all three judges score cards {{at the time of}} the knock out. Judah was <b>adamant</b> <b>that</b> the body shot should have been called low and claimed that he had been expecting a mandatory five-minute recovery period.|$|E
5|$|Mulder confronts Skinner and The Smoking Man, {{believing that}} he and Scully were deceived into taking the case without knowing about the contagion. Mulder is <b>adamant</b> <b>that</b> the public should know the truth about Pinck's actions. The Smoking Man {{counters}} that public knowledge of the truth would create mass panic and {{do more harm than}} good. Mulder tries to take his case to Scully, but she agrees that exposing Pinck may result in a deadly hysteria. Paul becomes the only remaining proof of the company's crimes, but he takes a hostage and is killed by the Marshals before Mulder can convince him to divulge the contents of Torrance's package. The episode ends with Skinner warning Mulder to be more wary of the situations he will find himself in.|$|E

50|$|They beg Leslie to {{call off}} his killing spree, but Leslie is <b>adamant,</b> believing <b>that</b> his {{survivor}} girl will define herself by facing him.

The group looks to Kelly for leadership, but she unexpectedly dies.|$|R
5000|$|Se7en's vocal range can be {{classified}} in the tenor range. His voice {{can be described as}} smooth, mellow, and sometimes mildly abrasive (see vocal belting) when songs, such as [...] "Crazy," [...] "La La La," [...] "Hikari" [...] and [...] "I Know," [...] call for it. He often sings with a vibrato in his voice that American R&B singers are known for, and also incorporates beatboxing into many of his songs such as [...] "Passion." [...] Se7en maintains an <b>adamant</b> belief <b>that</b> he should not lipsync during his live performances.|$|R
5|$|Polls {{consistently}} {{indicated a}} tight {{race for the}} November general election. Negative ads from both sides dominated the campaign, with Obama's proclaiming that Romney shipped jobs overseas while at Bain Capital and kept money in offshore tax havens and Swiss bank accounts. A related issue dealt with Romney's purported responsibility for actions at Bain Capital after taking the Olympics post. Romney faced demands from Democrats to release additional years of his tax returns, an action a number of Republicans also felt would be wise; after being <b>adamant</b> <b>that</b> he would not do that, he released summaries of them in late September. During May and June, the Obama campaign spent heavily {{and was able to}} paint a negative image of Romney in voters' minds before the Romney campaign could construct a positive one.|$|E
5|$|Under the new constitution, Zimbabwe's Presidency was a {{ceremonial}} role with no governmental power; the first President was Canaan Banana. Mugabe had previously offered {{the position to}} Nkomo, who had turned it down in favour of becoming Minister of Home Affairs. Although working together, there remained an aura of resentment and suspicion between Mugabe and Nkomo. Mugabe gave ZAPU four cabinet seats, but Nkomo demanded more. In contrast, some ZANU-PF figures argued that ZAPU should not have any seats in government, suggesting that Zimbabwe be converted into a one-party state. Tekere and Enos Nkala were particularly <b>adamant</b> <b>that</b> {{there should be a}} crackdown on ZAPU. After Nkala called for ZAPU to be violently crushed during a rally in Entumbane, street clashes between the two parties broke out in the city.|$|E

While Jack believes that Bernard is dead, Rose is <b>adamant</b> <b>that</b> he is still alive. After Claire (Emilie de Ravin) is kidnapped by the Island's inhabitants (known to the survivors as the Others), Rose comforts Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), who believes it is not his fault and encourages him not to lose hope and prays for him.|$|E
