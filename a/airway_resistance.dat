25|$|A {{link between}} {{what we now know}} as the {{sympathetic}} system and the lung was shown in 1887 when Grossman showed that stimulation of cardiac accelerator nerves reversed muscarine induced airway constriction. In elegant experiments in the dog, where the sympathetic chain was cut {{at the level of the}} diaphragm, Jackson showed that there was no direct sympathetic innervation to the lung, but that bronchoconstriction was reversed by release of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla. An increased incidence of asthma has not been reported for adrenalectomized patients; those with a predisposition to asthma will have some protection from airway hyper-reactivity from their corticosteroid replacement therapy. Exercise induces progressive airway dilation in normal subjects that correlates with work load and is not prevented by beta blockade. The progressive dilation of the airway with increasing exercise is mediated by a progressive reduction in resting vagal tone. Beta blockade with propranolol causes a rebound in <b>airway</b> <b>resistance</b> after exercise in normal subjects over the same time course as the bronchoconstriction seen with exercise induced asthma. The reduction in <b>airway</b> <b>resistance</b> during exercise reduces the work of breathing.|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} the Preakness, {{a new round of}} minor press excitement, dubbed [...] "nasalgate", erupted when Sherman commented that Martin might not let California Chrome run in the Belmont Stakes if the New York Racing Association (NYRA) did not allow the horse to wear a nasal strip as he had in his {{previous}} six races. [...] Nasal strips are not considered performance-enhancing, but may reduce <b>airway</b> <b>resistance,</b> lower the risk of exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH), and aid post-race recovery. Sherman submitted a formal request for permission to use them, and the following day, the NYRA approved their use for all horses on New York tracks, thus resolving the matter.|$|E

Davies ABSTRACT: We measured upper <b>airways</b> <b>resistance</b> from the trachea and from the pharynx to the atmosphere, EMG of the genioglossus muscle {{and the sound of}} snoring, In anaesthetized greyhounds, breathing spontane· ously through the upper airways. Using extra-corporeally produced con-tinuous flow we determined flow/pressure curves for the upper <b>airways</b> and <b>resistances</b> from the trachea and from the pharynx. We tested the effects of 0. 9 % saUne and of Sonarex (a proprietary mixture containing sodium chloride, glycerol, polysorbate 80 and benzalkonium chloride). Both saline and Sonarex decreased upper <b>airways</b> <b>resistance,</b> but the latter did so more consistently. With Sonarex, genioglossus activity Increased and the sound of snoring decreased. Flow/pressure curves 5 - 20 min after Sonarex showed a decrease in upper <b>airways</b> <b>resistance</b> and a smoother curve, whereas those with saline showed an increase in resistance. The sound produced by continuous flow through the upper airways was decreased by Sonarex but Increased by saline. Thus, both Sonarex and saline decrease upper <b>airways</b> <b>resistance,</b> but Sonarex also reduces the sound of snoring and the resistance and sound of continuous airflow through the upper airways...|$|R

Several illustrative numerical examples for a two-compartment lung model are presented and the response of the multicompartment lung model with nonlinear resistances and nonlinear compliances is compared to that of a multicompartment lung model with linear resistances and nonlinear compliances.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} reliability of a digital tracheal sound analyser (ELENS-DSA) in predicting nocturnal changes in <b>airways</b> <b>resistance</b> in asthmatic patients. This device allows continuous measurement of {{the proportion of the}} time occupied by wheezing (Wh%). METHODS: Nocturnal polygraphic studies with simultaneous continuous monitoring of tracheal sounds and <b>airways</b> <b>resistance</b> were performed in seven patients with nocturnal asthma. In order to evaluate the possible bias in wheezing estimation, each tracheal sound recording was passed through the automatic analyser and simultaneously monitored with earphones by an experienced observer. RESULTS: The device detected audible wheezing with an optimal sensitivity and specificity of 70 %. Snoring was a minor cause of the relatively poor characteristics of the system. A close correlation (p < 0. 001) between Wh% and <b>airways</b> <b>resistance</b> was observed only in those patients with the highest increase in resistance; when the results of all the subjects were pooled the correlation observed was poor. The predictive value of Wh% in detecting changes in <b>airways</b> <b>resistance</b> during 10 minute intervals was lower than 70 %. The positive and negative predictive values of Wh% were raised to 79 % and 83 %, respectively, for 30 minute intervals. CONCLUSIONS: The ELENS-DSA system is a relatively crude means of detecting wheezing and assessing bronchoconstriction quantitatively. However, it is able to detect accurately nocturnal bronchoconstriction for 30 minute intervals. This finding, along {{with the fact that the}} monitoring is non-invasive, suggests that it may be a promising tool, especially for patients during sleep...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{demonstrated}} that by combining data from several recent controlled human exposure studies it is possible systematically to relate increases in <b>airways</b> <b>resistance</b> to the rate of SO 2 exposure (D.,,in) in the exercising asthmatic. It was determined that the mode of SO 2 exposure (oral vs. oronasal) greatly influences the degree of response in the asthmatic. Forced oral breathing consistently produces larger percentage increases in SRaw per unit increase in SO 2 exposure rate. We have demonstrated further that while the dose/effect relationship which describes the increases in specific <b>airways</b> <b>resistance</b> (SRaw) versus exposure rate (D.,n) of S 02 is most consistently exponential in character, a linear (more conservative) model {{also can be used}} to fit the data. Using both the linear and exponential model, we have constructed a matrix which allows direct estimation of the combined minute ventilation (VE) and SO 2 concentration (as ppm or jig/L) required to achieve various levels of specific <b>airways</b> <b>resistance</b> increase.

40|$|AIMS: The {{effects of}} a single dose of {{oxymetazoline}} nasal spray on nasal patency have been compared with placebo using three separate measuring systems in normal subjects. METHODS: The study was a placebo-controlled, randomised double-blind crossover trial. Subjects without ear, nose or throat disease and with resting nasal <b>airways</b> <b>resistance</b> > 0. 15 Pa s cm- 3 were selected so that a fall in <b>airways</b> <b>resistance</b> could be detected. Nasal <b>airways</b> <b>resistance</b> (NAR) was measured by NR 6 - 2 rhinomanometer. Acoustic rhinometry (SR- 2000 rhinometer) provided {{the sum of the}} minimum cross-sectional areas (tMCA) and volume (tVOL) of the left and right nasal cavities. Symptoms of congestion were assessed on a visual analogue scale (CON, range 0 - 100). Measurements were made for 60 min before and for 120 min after bilateral administration of oxymetazoline nasal spray (0. 9 mg) or placebo (0. 9 % saline). Crossover occurred 7 - 21 days later. Results for all measures were analysed as change from average baseline value by trapezoidal AUC, and statistical significance was tested by 2 -way anova. RESULTS: NAR, tMCA, tVOL and CON did not change after placebo, but NAR and CON fell and tMCA and tVOL increased significantly at all timepoints after oxymetazoline. NAR_AUC, tVOL_AUC, tMCA_AUC were significantly different between placebo and oxymetazoline (P< 0. 001) as was CON_AUC (P= 0. 012). The day-to-day intraindividual repeatability of baseline NAR tMCA and tVOL was < 10 %.
