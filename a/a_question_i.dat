25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>I</b> asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> <b>I</b> {{stated that the}} Bush Administration exploited post-9/11 fears to advance a policy agenda that has undermined our civil liberties. I stand by this statement. ...I want to be clear that the murderous Nazi regime is historically distinct and {{the horror of the}} Holocaust must be acknowledged as a unique event in human history. I did not intend any direct comparison between the totalitarian state of Nazi Germany and the current administration. I have taken consistent and strong stands against Holocaust denial throughout my life in public service." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I wasn't a rabble rouser. [...] I wasn't a big {{noisemaker}} in the infield, {{which a lot}} {{of managers}} think you've got to be or you're not showing. [...] But I don't think it contributes much." [...] Gehringer also had a sense of humor about his reputation. [...] At a civic banquet in his honor, Gehringer's entire speech consisted of the following: [...] "I'm known around baseball as saying very little, and I'm not going to spoil my reputation." [...] When asked why he signed his name [...] "Chas. Gehringer", he responded: [...] "Why use seven letters when four will do?" [...] On another occasion, when asked about his closed-lip reputation, he responded: [...] "Not true; if somebody asked me <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> <b>I</b> would answer them. If they said, 'Pass the salt,' I would pass the salt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Without admitting anything," [...] {{answered}} Edward Cossey, [...] "I wish {{to ask you}} <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> <b>Is</b> {{there no}} way out of this? Supposing that I have done you a wrong, wrong admits of compensation." ...|$|R
6000|$|True, gallant Raleigh [...] But oh, thou {{champion}} of thy country's fame, [...] There is <b>a</b> <b>question</b> which <b>I</b> yet must ask [...] <b>A</b> <b>question</b> which <b>I</b> never ask'd before-- [...] What mean these mighty armaments? [...] This general muster? and this throng of chiefs?" ...|$|R
60|$|It was <b>a</b> {{singular}} <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> {{looked at}} him quickly. His face was sphinxlike.|$|R
2500|$|All of {{a sudden}} we had two Australian teams on one tour... I {{certainly}} felt excluded... At one stage in England I was waiting in a bar for my teammates to come downstairs, but because everyone was up the street with Packer, they never came... I was certainly disappointed to be left out. At that stage I think I had played nine Tests and was averaging 40 and you had other people who were barely Shield cricketers being called up by Packer. I didn't know the reasons why those guys were in it and I wasn't. That is always <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>I</b> will wonder about. I certainly kept being mates with Hookesy... It was a strange feeling. There were times when we were there to play for Australia and some blokes were off at a meeting about something else. There were times when there were arguments in the bar that got a lot louder than what they should have been.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it's not <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> <b>I</b> think, {{on which}} they quite feel together. SHE thinks, dear Fanny, {{that we ought to}} be greater." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I simply {{mean that}} even {{you could hardly}} have asked Miss Effingham such <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> have asked her, and she has refused me." ...|$|E
60|$|This was <b>a</b> home <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> plunged in like {{a swimmer}} into a deep stream.|$|R
60|$|It was a direct, almost <b>a</b> blunt <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> {{was taken}} by surprise, but I {{answered}} her without hesitation.|$|R
6000|$|GEORGE. Then what do {{you talk}} about--your minds? [CLARE looks at him] Will you answer <b>a</b> {{straight}} <b>question?</b> <b>Is</b> he {{falling in love with}} you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{where is}} that money to come from, dame?" [...] said Jenkin; [...] "there is <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>I</b> would fain have {{answered}} before I touch it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>I</b> {{must decide}} at my leisure,' said Mr. Mohun, mounting. 'Stand {{out of the}} way, Phyl, or you will feel how horses dance.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anne Shirley, when I ask you <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>I</b> {{want to be}} answered. Sit {{right up}} this very minute {{and tell me what}} you are crying about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is beyond}} all measure charming of you," [...] Guillot declared, [...] "but {{let me ask}} you <b>a</b> little <b>question.</b> <b>Is</b> it peace or war?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] Captain Griffiths {{replied in}} {{somewhat}} stilted fashion, [...] "is not <b>a</b> <b>question</b> which <b>I</b> {{should be prepared}} to answer off-hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|I told Lorenzo {{all that}} had happened, while he listened intently, {{occasionally}} interrupting me to ask <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> When <b>I</b> had finished, he said-- ...|$|R

6000|$|... "'Well, we won't go into that,' {{said his}} earlship, 'an' I {{want to ask}} you <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> suppose you {{represent}} the middle class in your country?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{reminds me}} of <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>I</b> {{was going to ask}} you," [...] Jacob went on. [...] "What price are we going to charge for the {{electric}} light?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle is very wise," [...] he answered. [...] "Indeed, it {{is better}} not. There remains now <b>a</b> <b>question</b> which <b>I</b> have come to ask." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May <b>I</b> ask <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> doctor? <b>Is</b> she pining in {{this close}} place, too? When her sister comes, will her sister take her away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{would think}} the fellow lived next door," [...] Ricardo growled impatiently. [...] "Hang it all, can't you {{understand}} <b>a</b> plain <b>question?</b> <b>I</b> have asked you the way." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nothing, just at present, Mr. Billow. I {{want to ask}} you <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> know that, in {{your way}} of business, you become {{connected}} with all sorts of strange characters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{that same}} r'ason, and one betther still, {{as we had}} nothin' to dhrink. Well, says Nick--'Mike,' says he--'you like cap'in, and Missus, and Miss Beuly, and Miss Maud, and the babby?' Divil burn ye, Nick,' says I, 'why do ye ask so foolish <b>a</b> <b>question?</b> <b>Is</b> it likes ye would know? Well--then just ask yerself if you likes yer own kith and kin, and ye've got yer answer.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want to know, my love, {{if there}} is any other man in the world who is as fond of his darling as I am of you? If such a person exists, and if adverse {{circumstances}} compel him to travel, I should like to ask <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> <b>Is</b> he perpetually calling to mind forgotten things, which he ought to have said to his sweetheart before he left her? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Miss Schuyler drily, [...] "it depends a {{good deal}} on how you're made; but it's {{generally}} risky for one or the other. Still, perhaps you might, for I have a fancy there's something short in you. Now, I'm {{going to ask you}} <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> <b>Is</b> it thinking of the other man that has made you restless? I mean the one we saw at the depot?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Where, indeed?" [...] said Hohora {{with open}} eyes, [...] "though I {{never heard it}} before, that's <b>a</b> {{staggering}} <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> beseech you, who was the sage that asked it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> {{and there}} must be <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> papa. <b>I</b> will not have it. If my being here would be an expense too great for you, I will go away." ...|$|R
