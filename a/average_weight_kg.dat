40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of age on slaughterhouse by-products and their chemical composition of indigenous cattle of Bangladesh. Live weight, warm carcass weight and dressing percentage of different age group (T 1 = 0 Tooth, T 2 = 2 Teeths, T 3 = 4 Teeths, T 4 = 6 Teeths and T 5 = 8 Teeths) of indigenous cattle were estimated. Average live weight and warm carcass weight of indigenous cattle was 167. 64 ± 79. 93 kg and 84. 83 ± 47. 88 kg, respectively on which age has significant effect. The average dressing percentage of indigenous cattle was 48. 99 ± 4. 84.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the reproductive and growth performances of pig breeds in Douala, Cameroon. The reproductive performance of gilts and multiparous sows (38 per group) from 8 selected farms were monitored and controlled. Thereafter, piglets were controlled from birth to weaning age. The age at first service (AFS), fertility index (FI), fecundity, age at first farrowing (AFF), weight at first farrowing (WtFF) and litter size (LS) of gilts were 179. 97 ± 25. 40 days; 1. 76 ± 0. 77; 100 ± 0. 00; 350. 47 ± 40. 58 days; 107. 26 ± 31. 85 kg and 7. 18 ± 1. 93 piglets, respectively. In sows, the FI, fecundity, LS and farrowing interval (FarI) were 1. 13 ± 0. 34; 100 ± 0. 00; 9. 03 ± 2. 14 piglets and 179. 63 ± 25. 14 days, respectively.

40|$|Intensive feeding {{trials of}} Fulani and Djallonke rams with grains (Millet, Maize) and cotton seed, in Northern Benin. This note {{presents}} the results of a preliminary trial including entire rams five Fulani and five Djallonke fed with grain (millet and maize), cotions seed and green fodder. A daily weightgain on animals 14 to 20 months old was 105, 7 ± 157 g for Djallonke (<b>average</b> <b>weight</b> 23, 0 <b>kg</b> {{at the beginning of the}} trial) and 117, 6 ± 167 g for Fulani (<b>average</b> <b>weight</b> 35, 2 <b>kg</b> at the beginning of the trial), 9, 5 g/metabolic kg for Djallonke and 7, 8 g/metabolic kg for Fulani. No significative differences in performance were observed between the two races. In spite of the high level of energy and protein in the feeding, results of growth and indices were disappointing. A better management of the operation (especially purchase) would permit higher profits than those obtained : 570 FCFA by Fulani and 910 FCFA by Djallonke. With our results and in the local conditions, intensive feeding of Djallonke seems more indicated...|$|R
