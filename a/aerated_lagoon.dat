40|$|<b>Aerated</b> <b>lagoons</b> are {{distinguished}} in two types: completely mixed, {{where the}} power input {{is sufficient to}} keep solids in suspension and to maintain a completely mixed flow pattern {{as well as an}} aerobic environment throughout the lagoon; and incompletely mixed, where the power input is not enough to keep solids in suspension (solids settle {{to the bottom of the}} tank) but sufficient to satisfy the oxygen demand.

40|$|Introduction: Using <b>aerated</b> <b>lagoons</b> for the {{treatment}} of municipal wastewater in the areas with warm and cold climate is convenient if the enough and cheap land is existed. Because of the strict environmental regulations, water resources shortage and the necessity of effluent reuse, treatment of municipal wastewater by <b>aerated</b> <b>lagoons</b> is easily feasible. This study was investigated to evaluate the performance of <b>aerated</b> <b>lagoons</b> of Ilam city from September 2012 to May 2013. Materials & Methods: The sampling (eighteen samples) from inlet and outlet of {{the treatment}} plant was conducted during nine continuously months. The performance of the waste water treatment plant was carried out using indices such as BOD 5, COD, TSS, TN, total coliform and fecal coliform in the influent and effluent. All the experiments were conducted according to the standard method for the examination of water and wastewater reference and the results were analyzed by Excel and SPSS (Pearson's correlation and T-test) softwares.

40|$|Intensive {{depuration}} {{plants have}} often shown low reliability and economic sustainability, when utilised for agro-industrial wastewater treatment, {{due to the}} particular wastewater properties: high organic load and essential oil concentrations, acidity, nutrient scarcity and qualitative-quantitative variability of effluents. <b>Aerated</b> <b>lagooning</b> systems represent a suitable alternative, because {{they are able to}} assure good reliability and low energy requirements, avoiding the drawbacks shown by the intensive depuration plants. In order to optimize performance of the lagooning systems, particularly in terms of energy requirements, depuration processes of aerobic-anaerobic <b>aerated</b> <b>lagoons</b> were investigated, both at full- and laboratory-scale. Citrus processing wastewater were subject to bubble aeration with low flow rates and limited time; the removal rate of organic load was evaluated and energy requirements of different depuration schemes were compared. The experimental investigations in full-scale <b>aerated</b> <b>lagoons</b> showed a low energy supply (0. 21 - 0. 59 kWh per kg of COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) removed with an average value of 0. 45 kWh kgCOD – 1), an adequate equalisation capability and constantly good depurative performance also with high concentrations of essential oil (500 - 1000 ppm). The experimental investigations in lab-scale aerated tanks under controlled conditions indicated the possibility of decreasing energy requirements (down to 0. 16 kWh kgCOD – 1) by reducing aeration power (down to 0. 6 W m– 3) and limiting aeration time to night 12 hours only, when energy price is lower. In spite of the low aeration, the COD removal rates were on the average six-fold higher compared to the anaerobic tank.

The hydraulic behaviour of ALs and especially the Facultative <b>aerated</b> <b>lagoons</b> (FALs) is very complex since the aeration in these systems is designed for oxygen transfer but not necessarily to create complete mixing. In this work, the energy expenditure of the aerators was studied {{by means of a}} scenario analysis. 3 D CFD models (one phase and multiphase) of a 3 ha FAL in a waste stabilization pond system in Cuenca (Ecuador) were built for different configurations of aerators.

The predictions of a single phase model were in satisfactory agreement with experimental results. Subsequently, a scenario analysis assessing several aeration schemes with different numbers of aerators in operation were tested with respect to velocity profiles and residence time distribution (RTD) curves. This analysis showed that the aeration scheme with all 10 aerators switched on produces a similar hydraulic behaviour compared to using only 6 or 8 aerators. The current operational schemes comprise of switching off some aerators during the peak hours of the day and operating all 10 aerators during night. This current practice could be economically replaced by continuously operating 4 or 6 aerators without significantly affecting the overall mixing.
