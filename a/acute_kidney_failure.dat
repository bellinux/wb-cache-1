5|$|The {{second phase}} occurs between 24h and 72h {{following}} overdose {{and consists of}} signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in liver cells as they metabolize the paracetamol. The individual may experience right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; International normalized ratio (INR) and the liver transaminases ALT and AST rise to abnormal levels. <b>Acute</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>failure</b> may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either hepatorenal syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. In some cases, <b>acute</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>failure</b> may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, {{it has been suggested}} that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.|$|E
5|$|Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) {{kidney failure}} {{is the result}} of {{ethylene}} glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after getting into antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after getting into antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetance may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and <b>acute</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>failure.</b> If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.|$|E
5|$|The kidney {{toxicity}} of ethylene glycol occurs 24 to 72 hours post ingestion and {{is caused by}} a direct cytotoxic effect of glycolic acid. The glycolic acid is then metabolized to glyoxylic acid and finally to oxalic acid. Oxalic acid binds with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals which may deposit and cause damage to many areas of the body including the brain, heart, kidneys, and lungs. The most significant effect is accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys which causes kidney damage leading to oliguric or anuric <b>acute</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>failure.</b> The rate-limiting step in this cascade is the conversion of glycolic to glyoxylic acid. Accumulation of glycolic acid in the body is mainly responsible for toxicity.|$|E

5|$|The main {{manifestations of}} carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning develop in the organ systems most dependent on oxygen use, {{the central nervous system}} and the heart. The initial symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, nausea, malaise, and fatigue. These symptoms are often mistaken for a virus such as influenza or other illnesses such as food poisoning or gastroenteritis. Headache is the most common symptom of acute carbon monoxide poisoning; it is often described as dull, frontal, and continuous. Increasing exposure produces cardiac abnormalities including fast heart rate, low blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmia; central nervous system symptoms include delirium, hallucinations, dizziness, unsteady gait, confusion, seizures, central nervous system depression, unconsciousness, respiratory arrest, and death. Less common symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include myocardial ischemia, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, high blood sugar, lactic acidosis, muscle necrosis, <b>acute</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>failure,</b> skin lesions, and visual and auditory problems.|$|E
5|$|Death caps {{have been}} {{reported}} to taste pleasant. This, coupled with the delay in the appearance of symptoms—during which time internal organs are being severely, sometimes irreparably, damaged—makes it particularly dangerous. Initially, symptoms are gastrointestinal in nature and include colicky abdominal pain, with watery diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, which may lead to dehydration if left untreated, and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid–base disturbances. These first symptoms resolve two to three days after the ingestion. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substance in the blood. Kidney failure (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic kidney damage) and coagulopathy may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure, intracranial bleeding, pancreatic inflammation, <b>acute</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>failure,</b> and cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, early {{reports from}} the 1908 Messina {{earthquake}} and World War I on kidney failure after injury were followed by studies by London physicians Eric Bywaters and Desmond Beall, working at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School and the National Institute for Medical Research, on four victims of The Blitz in 1941. Myoglobin was demonstrated in the urine of victims by spectroscopy, and {{it was noted that}} the kidneys of victims resembled those of patients who had hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin rather than myoglobin being the cause of the kidney damage). In 1944 Bywaters demonstrated experimentally that the kidney failure was mainly caused by myoglobin. Already during the war, teams of doctors traveled to bombed areas to provide medical support, chiefly with intravenous fluids, as dialysis was not yet available. The prognosis of <b>acute</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>failure</b> improved markedly when dialysis was added to supportive treatment, which first happened during the 1950–1953 Korean War.|$|E

25|$|Harlow's {{kidney failure}} {{could not have}} been cured in the 1930s. The death rate from <b>acute</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>failure</b> has {{decreased}} to 25% only after the advent of antibiotics, dialysis, and kidney transplantation. Harlow's grey complexion, recurring illnesses, and severe sunburn were signs of the disease, as her kidneys had been slowly failing and toxins accumulated in her body, exposing her to other illnesses and causing symptoms including swelling, fatigue, and lack of appetite. Toxins also adversely affected her brain and central nervous system. Speculation has suggested that Harlow suffered a poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, following scarlet fever when she was young, which may have caused high blood pressure and ultimately kidney failure.|$|E
25|$|The classic {{presentation}} (in 40–50% of the cases) is episodic hematuria, {{which usually}} starts {{within a day}} or two of a non-specific upper respiratory tract infection (hence synpharyngitic), as opposed to post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which occurs some time (weeks) after initial infection. Less commonly gastrointestinal or urinary infection can be the inciting agent. All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production. Groin pain can also occur. The gross hematuria resolves after a few days, though microscopic hematuria may persist. These episodes occur on an irregular basis every few months and in most patients eventually subsides, although it can take many years. Renal function usually remains normal, though rarely, <b>acute</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>failure</b> may occur (see below). This presentation is more common in younger adults.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene glycol is {{poisonous}} {{to humans}} and other animals, {{and should be}} handled carefully and disposed of properly. Its sweet taste can lead to accidental ingestion or allow its deliberate use as a murder weapon. Ethylene glycol is difficult to detect in the body, and causes symptoms—including intoxication, severe diarrhea, and vomiting—that can be confused with other illnesses or diseases. Its metabolism produces calcium oxalate, which crystallizes in the brain, heart, lungs, and kidneys, damaging them; depending {{on the level of}} exposure, accumulation of the poison in the body can last weeks or months before causing death, but death by <b>acute</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>failure</b> can result within 72 hours if the individual does not receive appropriate medical treatment for the poisoning.
