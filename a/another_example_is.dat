5|$|The Hassi R'Mel {{power station}} in Algeria, {{is an example}} of {{combining}} CSP with a gas turbine, where a 25-megawatt CSP-parabolic trough array supplements a much larger 130MW combined cycle gas turbine plant. <b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the Yazd power station in Iran.|$|E
5|$|The {{classic example}} of a Type IIb {{supernova}} is Supernova 1993J, while <b>another</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> Cassiopeia A. The IIb class was first introduced (as a theoretical concept) by Woosley et al. in 1987, and the class was soon applied to SN 1987K and SN 1993J.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the Asociación Acueducto de Río Negro de Popayán, {{which was}} formed 10years ago {{integrating}} 10 supply systems, supplying 7,000 residential connections. The association is preparing its own {{water treatment plant}} and preparing to install meters {{with the aid of}} the Colombian organization Asociados en Desarrollo Rural (ADR) or Associates in Rural Development and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).|$|E

5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> {{the city}} of Berkeley, California. The tree {{protection}} ordinance prohibits the removal of coast live oak trees and any excessive pruning that can cause harm to the tree is also prohibited. The only exception is if the tree is poses a danger to life or limb and danger to the property.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulties}} of definition are considerable in some cases. For example, Haswell-Smith (2004) treats Lunga {{as a single}} island, although during high tides it becomes one inhabited island and numerous uninhabited tidal islets. <b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the smaller island of Eilean Mòr in Loch Dunvegan, which joins with nearby Eilean Dubh and Garay Island at low tides.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the Great Vowel Shift in English, {{which is}} the reason that the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>was</b> the Met Office who, in 1962, started {{publishing}} temperatures in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, dropping {{the use of}} Fahrenheit from their official reports in 1970.|$|R

5|$|Because {{of their}} size, shape, and {{well-defined}} chemical structures, viruses {{have been used}} as templates for organising materials on the nanoscale. Recent examples include work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., using Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) particles to amplify signals in DNA microarray based sensors. In this application, the virus particles separate the fluorescent dyes used for signalling to prevent the formation of non-fluorescent dimers that act as quenchers. <b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the use of CPMV as a nanoscale breadboard for molecular electronics.|$|E
5|$|Exponentiation {{occurs in}} many areas of {{mathematics}} and its inverse function {{is often referred to as}} the logarithm. For example, the logarithm of a matrix is the (multi-valued) inverse function of the matrix exponential. <b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the p-adic logarithm, the inverse function of the p-adic exponential. Both are defined via Taylor series analogous to the real case. In the context of differential geometry, the exponential map maps the tangent space at a point of a manifold to a neighborhood of that point. Its inverse is also called the logarithmic (or log) map.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tales}} of heroic Greece, royal {{succession}} often passed from father-in-law to son-in-law, and some historians have seen in this an early example of the epikleros pattern. Some examples include Pelops, Bellerophon, Melampus, Peleus, Telamon, and Diomedes. Not all such heroic era royal successions followed the epikleros pattern however, {{as in the case}} of Menelaus, who married Helen of Troy and succeeded Helen's father Tyndareus, even though Tyndareus had living sons, Kastor and Polydeukes. <b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> Arete of Phaeacia in the Odyssey, who was an heiress married to her father's brother Alcinous.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>was</b> {{the system}} {{developed}} by the Canadian Armament Research and Development Establishment (CARDE) in the early 1950s to conduct supersonic flight tests on models of the Velvet Glove air-to-air missile.|$|R
50|$|In 1943 the Germans {{conducted}} the Gran Sasso raid which implemented {{many aspects of}} the air assault concept. <b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>was</b> the German Brandenburgers' glider borne operation at Ypenburg during World War Two.|$|R

5|$|Other {{antioxidants}} are not {{obtained from}} the diet, but instead {{are made in the}} body. For example, ubiquinol (coenzyme Q) is poorly absorbed from the gut and is made through the mevalonate pathway. <b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> glutathione, which is made from amino acids. As any glutathione in the gut is broken down to free cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid before being absorbed, even large oral intake has little effect on the concentration of glutathione in the body. Although large amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids such as acetylcysteine can increase glutathione, no evidence exists that eating high levels of these glutathione precursors is beneficial for healthy adults.|$|E
5|$|Some affiliative {{behaviors}} are seasonal or gender-specific, {{such as the}} male squeal approach and anogenital inspections performed during the mating season. <b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the female greeting behavior, where two females will use their anogenital scent glands to mark each other's backs, jump over one another, writhe together, and emit squealing vocalizations. This behavior is not seen during {{the end of the}} cool, dry season or around gestation. The frequency of other affiliative behaviors can be affected by age. All ruffed lemurs over five months of age allogroom, and, in captivity, subadults participate in play more frequently than adults.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System is chaotic over million- and billion-year timescales, {{with the}} orbits of the planets open to {{long-term}} variations. One notable example of this chaos is the Neptune–Pluto system, which lies in a 3:2 orbital resonance. Although the resonance itself will remain stable, it becomes impossible to predict the position of Pluto {{with any degree of}} accuracy more than 10–20million years (the Lyapunov time) into the future. <b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> Earth's axial tilt, which, due to friction raised within Earth's mantle by tidal interactions with the Moon (see below), will be incomputable at some point between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>were</b> public owned bus {{companies}} in the U.K. Those companies were reorganized in 1985 into private companies (with the exception of London). Cost savings mainly resulted from reduced employment costs and increased productivity.|$|R
50|$|The {{sculpture}} {{was awarded}} the 1926 Fairmount Park Association Prize from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. <b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>was</b> acquired by Brookgreen Gardens in 1940, from Charles Louis Borie, friend of the sculptor.|$|R
25|$|As a result, a whole {{genre of}} luk thung musicals, rhapsodizing Thailand's rural life in Isan <b>was</b> created. <b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>was</b> Dokdin Kanyamarn's 1971 musical comedy, Ai Tui (Mr. Tui), which starred Sombat Metanee and Petchara.|$|R
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example,</b> <b>is</b> the Junta Administradora del Acueducto La Sirena en el Valle del Cauca (Water Board La Sirena) in {{the southwestern}} {{outskirts}} of Cali, which manages 778 residential connections, offering continuous service to some 4,200 users. It operates a sewerage system and a wastewater treatment plant. Water consumption is metered. The average monthly tariff is US$3.5 for 28m3. There is no social stratification, but special tariffs are applied to those users who consume more than 28m3. The annual cash surplus is about US$10,000 which is reinvested in preventive maintenance {{and in some cases}} in construction works. In this way, in the last 3years a water capture facility was constructed in Quebrada Epaminondas, another one at Melendez River was improved, and a water tank with a capacity of 220m3 was constructed.|$|E
5|$|However, many {{traits that}} appear to be simple adaptations are in fact exaptations: {{structures}} originally adapted for one function, but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process. One example is the African lizard Holaspis guentheri, which developed an extremely flat head for hiding in crevices, as can be seen by looking at its near relatives. However, in this species, the head has become so flattened that it assists in gliding from tree to tree—an exaptation. Within cells, molecular machines such as the bacterial flagella and protein sorting machinery evolved by the recruitment of several pre-existing proteins that previously had different functions. <b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the recruitment of enzymes from glycolysis and xenobiotic metabolism to serve as structural proteins called crystallins within the lenses of organisms' eyes.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} {{threat to}} mass-producing plants for harvest is their susceptibility to diseases. Wild species have {{a range of}} genetic variability that allows some individuals to survive should a disturbance occur. In agriculture, resistance through variability is compromised, since genetically uniform seeds are planted under uniform conditions. Monocultural agriculture thus causes low crop diversity, especially when the seeds are mass-produced or when plants (such as grafted fruit trees and banana plants) are cloned. A single pest or disease could threaten a whole crop due to this uniformity. A well-known historic case was the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-1847, where a vital crop with low diversity was destroyed by a single fungus. <b>Another</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> when a disease caused by a fungus affected the monocultured 1970 US corn crop, causing a loss of over one billion dollars in production.|$|E
