40|$|David Armstrong has {{developed}} and refined {{his theory of}} laws of nature as relations between universals in many writings {{in the course of}} nearly thirty years 1. The basic idea of the theory seems initially to be a very natural and plausible way of explaining the causal regularities <b>of</b> nature. <b>It</b> is however- I shall argue- ultimately unsatisfactory because it fails to give an adequate account of causation; and a better account of causation opens the way to two very different explanations of the regularities of nature- a possible one of a familiar scientific kind, and/or a more probable one involving divine agency. I The world is a regular place; states of affairs follow each other almost all the time in regular ways- both at the observable level, and at the fundamental level (the latter regularities explaining the former ones).
