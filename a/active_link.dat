It is assumed that each source-destination pair communicates through a fading channel; consequently, destinations receive interference from all other active source-destination pairs. Under the assumption of independent Rayleigh fading channels for different sourcedestination pairs, it is shown that the optimal number of <b>active</b> <b>links</b> is of the order log N with probability approaching one as the total number of nodes, N, tends to infinity. The achievable total throughput is also scales logarithmically with the total number of links/nodes in the network. I...|$|R

In traditional Ibeji photography, photographs are doubled in order to fulfill the need for ritual figures used in the cult.

The use of the photograph as an <b>active</b> <b>link</b> with the spirit world is unprecedented in the history of photography as far as I know." [...] Shitou's photographs utilize the traditional photographic overlay and portraiture techniques developed by the Yoruba. Shitou said to his son: [...] "You must keep symmetry in mind. Use props along the axis, arrange the sitters, think of triangular or rectangular compositions." [...] In addition to using portrait techniques, Shitou chose subjects who would initially be seen as doubles or twins through their dress, poses, and attitudes, but upon closer inspection, would be revealed as separate people. Shitou worked with 6x6 cameras (Yashika) and a DSRL for color.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a new type}} of haptic interface, named <b>active</b> <b>link</b> mechanism. This device realizes {{physical}} man-machine interaction (PMI) between machines and persons. Two prototypes were developed to demonstrate the potential of the <b>active</b> <b>link</b> mechanisms. Developed interface devices are an active tetrahedron and an active icosahedron. Nine-DOF micro spherical joints and pressure control pneumatic cylinders were developed to realize the active tetrahedron, while fifteen-DOF micro spherical joints and intelligent pneumatic cylinders were developed for the active icosahedron. The tetrahedron successfully realizes &# 34;virtual touch&# 34;; the operators feel actions, forces, and shapes of the virtual objects in PC and also move and deform them. Real time PMI is realized by building the developed devices into MSC. Visual-Nastran 4 D. MSC. VisuaI-Nastran 4 D is a mechanism analysis software, which can make motion analysis in real time.

40|$|In {{the seminal}} paper by Foschini and Miljanic in 1993, a {{distributed}} power control algorithm {{was developed to}} meet SIR targets with minimal powers in cellular network uplinks. Since the SIR on an <b>active</b> <b>link</b> may dip below the SIR target during the transient after a new user enters the cell, Bambos et al. proposed an <b>active</b> <b>link</b> protection algorithm to provide robustness, at the expense of higher energy consumption. This paper examines the tradeoff between energy and robustness. An optimization problem is formulated where robustness is captured in the constraint and the price of robustness penalized in the objective function. A distributed algorithm is developed to solve this problem. Local convergence and optimality of equilibrium are proved for the algorithm. The objective function modulates the tradeoff between energy and robustness, and between energy and speed of admission, as illustrated through a series of numerical experiments. A parameterized family of objective functions is constructed to control the transient and equilibrium properties of robust distributed power control...|$|E
