5|$|Strupper {{scored the}} second {{touchdown}} on <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>drive</b> {{set up by}} his 40-yard punt return. Early in the second quarter, Strupper shot through the line for 70 yards and the third touchdown. Tech's fourth touchdown required considerable effort and a methodical drive, ending in a 15-yard dive for a touchdown by Strupper. End runs by Guyon and Simpson's line plunging set up the fifth (and final) touchdown with Guyon's 6-yard run. Strupper ran for 198 {{yards and three touchdowns}} on nine carries. Tech's starting lineup was Bell (left end), Fincher (left tackle), Thweatt (left guard), Phillips (center), Dowling (right guard), Rogers (right tackle), Carpenter (right end), Hill (quarterback), Strupper (left halfback), Guyon (right halfback), and Armsley (fullback).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe article {{presents}} the results of research on mathematical models of bearing capacity of <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>driven</b> pile with the pyramidal broadening in the upper part. The research was carried out using the piles of the same length and various sizes of broadening. In order to evaluate the increase of the bearing capacity of a pyramidal-prismatic pile compared with the same prismatic pile the calculations were performed in the software package Plaxis 3 D. The basis of the calculation was based on the well-known in soil mechanics the elastic-plastic model of Mohr-Coulomb. According to the data obtained the analysis was made concerning the increase of bearing capacity of <b>short</b> <b>driven</b> piles using <b>a</b> constructive solution - the broadening device at the top proposed by the authors...|$|R
5|$|Favre led the Packers {{to their}} best season in 30 {{years in the}} 1996 season, winning his second {{consecutive}} MVP award in the process. The Packers led the NFL in points scored (456) as well as fewest points allowed (210), joining only the 1972 Dolphins as the only two teams to ever accomplish this. The defense also set a then NFL record for least amount of touchdowns allowed in a 16-game season with 19. Favre threw for 3,899 yards, a career-high 39 touchdown passes (third highest ever at the time), only 13 interceptions, and passer rating of 95.8 (the third highest of his career). Green Bay tied the Denver Broncos for the NFL's best regular season record, 13–3, defeated the San Francisco 49ers (35–14) and Carolina Panthers (30–13) at Lambeau Field in the playoffs. The Packers advanced to Super Bowl XXXI at the Louisiana Superdome, <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>drive</b> from Favre's hometown.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{went on to}} {{play the}} Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXI in front of 101,063 fans at the Rose Bowl. After falling behind 10–9 at halftime, the Giants {{defeated}} the Broncos 39–20. A turning point of the game came on the first possession of the second half. The Giants received the second half kickoff, and led <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>drive</b> that stalled at their own 47-yard line. On fourth and one, the Giants lined up in a punt formation before shifting to a traditional set. Second string quarterback Jeff Rutledge then ran a quarterback sneak for a first down. The Giants scored on the drive, and built a 39–13 lead before a late touchdown by the Broncos made the final score 39–20. Quarterback Phil Simms was named MVP after completing 22 of 25 (88%) of his passes—a Super Bowl record.|$|E
5|$|A {{turning point}} of the game came on the first {{possession}} of the second half. The Giants received the second half kickoff, and led <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>drive</b> that stalled at their own 47-yard line. On fourth and 1, the Giants lined up in a punt formation before shifting to a traditional set. Second string quarterback Jeff Rutledge then looked over to Parcells for a signal {{as to whether he}} should try to draw the defense offside or run a play. After a nod of approval from Parcells, he ran a quarterback sneak for a first down. The Giants scored on the drive, and built a 39–13 lead before a late touchdown by the Broncos made the final score 39–20. Simms threw touchdown passes to Mark Bavaro and Phil McConkey to give him three on the game, and Joe Morris and Ottis Anderson each rushed for one touchdown. The Giants' defense limited the Broncos to only two net yards and 10 offensive plays in the third quarter. The 30 second half points set a Super Bowl-record for points in a half, and Simms was named MVP after completing 22 of 25 (88%) of his passes—a Super Bowl record which still stands.|$|E

25|$|Although Gardermoen {{is located}} further away than Hurum, the large degree of new, {{high-speed}} track {{allowed for a}} travel time of twenty minutes. The longer distance also gives longer driving time for cars, which resulted in estimated higher market share for the train. The Gardermoen alternative also allowed for the Intercity and long-haul trains on the Dovre Line {{to stop at the}} airport. While Hurum would give a larger portion of the population <b>a</b> <b>shorter</b> <b>drive</b> to the airport, the construction of the Gardermoen Line would conversely give a 15-minute-faster travel time than a train to Hurum from downtown Oslo.|$|R
