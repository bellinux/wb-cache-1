5|$|Corman later said, I’m {{weary of}} {{prepackaged}} formulas, {{and when you}} try out a new idea, you necessarily think about shooting a hackneyed scene {{in a funny way}} without resorting to parody. This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can I find a different sort of gunslinger?” Right <b>away,</b> <b>I</b> thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me all of a sudden. It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, but that was enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E

25|$|Stout self-{{published}} a small booklet (15 pp.) of poems, circa 1936. Two of {{the poems}} were {{in the form of}} letters: On Receiving Word that Stan Knauss Was Joining the Air Corps (September 18, 1918) and On Stan Becoming a Father (December 4, 1930). His autobiography, So <b>Away</b> <b>I</b> Went!, was published in 1951.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right <b>away.</b> <b>I</b> put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E
25|$|The two, at {{the extreme}} of their rivalry, {{climbing}} the road wrapped like a ribbon round the majestic volcano, terribly steep, in parallel action... I've always been convinced that in these moments that supreme player of poker, the Norman , used his craftiness and his fearless bluffing to win his fifth Tour. Because, to me, {{it was clear that}} Anquetil was at the very limit of his strength and that had Poulidor attacked him repeatedly and suddenly then he would have cracked... Although his advisers claim that his error in maintaining steady pressure rather than attacking was the result of using slightly too big a gear, which stopped his jumping <b>away,</b> <b>I</b> still think that it was in his head that Pou-Pou should have changed gears.|$|E

500|$|After leaving school, Oliver {{studied and}} worked in Sydney. She had {{intended}} to enrol in painting classes, but a computer error placed her in the sculpture course: she later said [...] "I knew straight <b>away</b> <b>I</b> {{was in the right}} place".|$|E
500|$|Whereas {{the first}} song {{was a little bit}} more artistic and a little bit more soulful, and it has done everything, it {{probably}} exceeded my expectations, I mean, from the moment I was able to give it <b>away.</b> <b>I</b> was able to kind of be reintroduced in a way musically, and thank you to [...] Diplo, but 'Scream' is really like the next step.

500|$|Arthur J. Burks, the President of the American Fiction Guild, {{wrote that}} an excited Hubbard {{called him and}} said: [...] "I {{want to see you}} right <b>away.</b> <b>I</b> have written THE book." [...] Hubbard {{believed}} that Excalibur would [...] "revolutionize everything" [...] and that [...] "it was somewhat more important, and would have a greater impact upon people, than the Bible." [...] It proposed that all human behavior could be explained in terms of survival and that to understand survival was to understand life. As Hubbard biographer Jon Atack notes, [...] "the notion that everything that exists is trying to survive became the basis of Dianetics and Scientology." ...|$|E

500|$|There were initial {{fears that}} Richard's glamorous image {{would not work}} for the {{character}} and Smith also feared that Richard would be apprehensive about playing Pauline, who would be anything but glamorous, but these fears were swept aside when Richard announced that she was sick of glamour and wanted to play her own age. Richard has commented, [...] "although it would be such a huge transformation of my screen image, it was after all my twenty-fifth year in showbusiness, and I'd realised that I couldn't go on playing dolly birds forever... I knew right <b>away</b> <b>I</b> would be mad {{to turn down the}} part of Pauline." ...|$|E
500|$|On 21 May 1942, The Shooting Star {{concluded}} serialisation. Less {{than a week}} later, {{the occupied}} government proclaimed that all Jews in Belgium would {{have to wear a}} yellow badge on their clothing, and in July the Gestapo began raids on Jewish premises, followed by deportations of Jews to Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps, resulting in around 32,000 Belgian Jews being killed. Hergé later recalled: [...] "I saw very few Jews wearing the yellow star, but finally I did see some. They told me that some Jews were gone; that people had come for them and sent them <b>away.</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to believe it." ...|$|E
500|$|While on tour, the xx acclimated {{themselves}} to the increased attention and became considerably more sociable and confident. As Sim recounted, [...] "If you'd have put me onstage at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire a few years ago, I'd have run <b>away.</b> <b>I</b> couldn't have done it. We used to be terrified." [...] In June, the band played the Glastonbury Festival in Somerset and, according to journalist Jude Rogers, displayed a newfound confidence {{through the rest of}} their summer and [...] "post-Mercury [...] autumn" [...] concerts: [...] "Croft would sing more boldly, Sim developed an onstage swagger and Smith began experimenting with different rhythms and textures." ...|$|E
6000|$|I meditated swiftly. I made an {{estimate}} of the little man's appearance as he drew nearer. [...] "By Jove!" [...] he said, [...] "you've had a time of it! I thought you-- Well-- Where were you cast <b>away?</b> <b>Is</b> that thing a sort of floating thing for saving life?" ...|$|R

500|$|Sparks {{produced}} the album, their first in this genre, {{after it was}} commissioned as a radio musical by Sweden's national broadcasting service, Sveriges Radio. The project was proposed to Sparks by Marie Wennersten of SR Radioteatern, the station's radio drama department. Wennersten had become a Sparks fan after watching the duo perform in Sweden in 2004: [...] "I {{had never seen such}} energy and love from the audience. I thought the Södra Theatre was going to take off and fly <b>away.</b> <b>I</b> wrote to the Sparks fansite and thanked them for the experience." [...] Wennersten subsequently travelled to Los Angeles as a journalist, to attend and report on another Sparks concert. By that time, the idea of a collaboration had formed in her mind: [...] "I always dreamed of dragging them into the radio world." ...|$|E
500|$|Sayers' {{ability as}} a runner in the open field was {{considered}} unmatched, both during his playing career and since his retirement. Although he possessed modest raw speed—he completed a 100-yard dash in 9.7 seconds—he was highly elusive and had terrific vision, a combination which made him very difficult to tackle. Actor Billy Dee Williams, who portrayed Sayers in the 1971 film Brian's Song, likened his running to [...] "ballet" [...] and [...] "poetry". Mike Ditka, a teammate of Sayers' for two seasons, called him [...] "the greatest player I've ever seen. That's right—the greatest." [...] Another former teammate, linebacker Dick Butkus, famous for his tackling ability, said of Sayers: He had this ability to go full speed, cut and then go full speed again right <b>away.</b> <b>I</b> saw it every day in practice. We played live, and you could never get a clean shot on Gale. Never.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, one of Sesame Street's {{international}} co-productions, Takalani Sesame, {{caused some}} {{controversy in the}} US when the first HIV-positive Muppet, Kami, was created in response to South Africa's AIDS epidemic. It {{marked the first time}} AIDS and the goal of confronting the disease's stigma was included in a preschool curriculum. According to the documentary, The World According to Sesame Street, the reaction of many in the US surprised Sesame Workshop. Some members of Congress attacked Sesame Street, Sesame Workshop, and PBS. According to co-producer Naila Farouky, [...] "The reaction we got in the US blew me <b>away.</b> <b>I</b> didn't expect people to be so horrible... and hateful and mean". The controversy in the US was short-lived, and died down when the public discovered the facts about the South African co-production, and when United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and prominent minister and conservative political commentator Jerry Falwell praised the Workshop's efforts. Kami went on to be named UNICEF's Champion for Children in November 2003.|$|E

500|$|As many expected, {{the highly}} {{anticipated}} domestic clash was a savage brawl from round one. Gomez won the opening rounds {{and threatened to}} overpower Johanneson from the opening seconds. The Leeds fighter then gained the upper hand as the fight went on, flooring Gomez in the sixth round only for the [...] "Irish Mexican" [...] {{to rise from the}} canvas. Soon after, with Gomez appearing unsteady on his feet, referee Mickey Vann stopped the fight. Gomez said that Vann had stopped the fight early, adding, [...] "When the stoppage came, I wasn't wobbling or staggering, and I only dropped my hands in the fight to show Johanneson that he couldn't hurt me. But the referee simply got the wrong message. It was bad refereeing. I told him straight <b>away</b> <b>I</b> was fine, but he insisted on showing me to my corner." [...] The former champion was clear that he wanted another opportunity to fight for the British title.|$|E
500|$|The novel Miracle at St. Anna {{was written}} by James McBride [...] {{originating}} from his late uncle's experiences as a World War II soldier. [...] Upon writing the novel, McBride conducted his own research and learned of the 92nd Infantry Division, which consisted of 15,000 African-American soldiers, who served in Italy during World War II from August 1944 to November 1945. McBride interviewed several remaining members of the 92nd Division. [...] "I studied Italian at The New School in New York City," [...] he explained. [...] "I moved to Italy with my family for six months. I interviewed dozens of Italians—Partisans and Fascists. I interviewed dozens of African-American soldiers who fought in the war, most who have since passed <b>away.</b> <b>I</b> must have read at least 20 books. I went to the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. I studied the whole business of what the 92nd did in Italy during the war, {{to try to get}} an idea of what really transpired." [...] The 92nd Division served as the basis for McBride's novel, which was published in 2003.|$|E
500|$|His law {{practice}} increased greatly from this exposure, {{as did the}} demands on his time. In 1771, he moved Abigail and the children to Braintree, but he kept his office in Boston, saying, [...] "I shall spend more Time in my Office than ever I did." [...] He also noted {{on the day of}} the family's move, [...] "Now my family is <b>away,</b> <b>I</b> feel no Inclination at all, no Temptation, to be any where but at my Office. I am in it by 6 in the Morning – I am in it at 9 at night.... In the Evening, I can be alone at my Office, and no where else. I never could in my family." [...] Nevertheless, after some time in the capital, he became disenchanted with the rural and [...] "vulgar" [...] Braintree as a home for his family. In August 1772, therefore, Adams moved his family back to Boston. He purchased a large brick house on Queen Street, not far from his office. In 1774, Adams and Abigail returned the family to the farm due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston, and Braintree remained their permanent Massachusetts home.|$|E
60|$|Lau. Well, then, I can't bear {{to be shut}} up all day so like a nun. I am sure it {{is enough}} to make one wish to be run <b>away</b> with--and <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> was run <b>away</b> with--I do--and <b>I</b> wish the {{lieutenant}} knew it.|$|R

I shall like to hear that you succeed in that.|$|R
