[...] Perhaps Mr. Chapman has in mind the fatter but less characteristic type of Indian sometimes seen on the reservations." [...] Chapman wrote again, and had the correspondence published in the numismatic press, but no one at the lame duck Roosevelt White House bothered to reply, according to Burdette, [...] "the new coins were issued and would remain as they were for twenty-five years, or until Congress ordered them changed".

2500|$|McLuhan met Corinne Lewis (1912–2008) in St. Louis, {{a teacher}} and {{aspiring}} actress from Fort Worth, Texas, and they were married on August 4, 1939. They spent 1939–40 in Cambridge, where he completed his master's degree (awarded in January 1940) and began {{to work on his}} doctoral dissertation on Thomas Nashe and the verbal arts. While the McLuhans were in England, war had broken out in Europe. For this reason, he obtained permission to complete and submit his dissertation from the United States, without having to return to Cambridge for an oral defence. In 1940, the McLuhans returned to Saint Louis University, where he continued teaching and they started a family. He was awarded a Ph.D. in December 1943. [...] He next taught at Assumption College in Windsor, Ontario from 1944 to 1946, then moved to Toronto in 1946 where he joined the faculty of St. Michael's College, a Catholic college of the University of Toronto. Hugh Kenner was one of his students and Canadian economist and communications scholar Harold Innis was a university colleague who had a strong influence on his work.

2500|$|Sovereigntists {{have also}} been against the {{presence}} {{of members of the}} Canadian Royal Family in Quebec. At the height of the Quiet Revolution, the Quebec press reported that extreme separatists were plotting to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II during her upcoming 1964 tour of the province, as well as to kidnap Premier Jean Lesage's son, should the Queen come to Quebec. Despite fears for the monarch's safety and talk of cancelling the trip, the Queen arrived as planned and, in a speech delivered to the Legislative Assembly on 10 October, in both French and English, spoke of Canada's two [...] "complementary cultures" [...] and the strength of Canada's two founding peoples; she stated: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> think that there exists in our Commonwealth a country where I can express myself officially in French... Whenever you sing [...] 'O Canada' you are reminded that you come of a proud race." [...] Still, as her motorcade passed through Quebec City, the route was lined with Quebecers showing their backs to the monarch; others booed her and shouted separatist slogans. Though the protesters were the minority in the crowds gathered to see the Queen (the Montreal Gazette reporting that those who opposed the visit were students numbering in the hundreds) the provincial police violently dispersed those demonstrators who took to marching through the streets, arresting 36, including some who had been there to show loyalty to the Queen.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a one-year}} break {{following}} {{the conclusion of}} Alias, her wedding to Affleck, {{and the birth of}} her first child, Garner returned to work in 2007. Her supporting role in Juno as a woman desperate to adopt a child was described by Kyle Buchanan of New York Magazine as a turning point in her career: [...] "She came into the movie a steely figure, and left it as the mother you'd give your own child to ... Writer Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman expertly deploy Garner's innate humanity as a trump card." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly said she had never [...] "been lovelier or more affecting." [...] She played an FBI investigator in the action thriller The Kingdom (2007). She was nursing her baby during filming in Arizona and was hospitalized on two occasions with heatstroke. In late 2007 and early 2008, Garner played Roxanne to Kevin Kline's Cyrano de Bergerac at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway. In preparation for the role, Garner worked with vocal and movement coaches and took French lessons. Ben Brantley of The New York Times described her performance as [...] "captivating": [...] " [...] Ms. Garner, I <b>am</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> report, makes Roxane a girl worth pining over ... speaks Anthony Burgess’s peppery rhymed translation with unaffected sprightliness. If she’s a tad stilted in the big tragic finale, her comic timing is impeccable." [...] The New Yorkers theater critic was impressed by her [...] "feistiness" [...] and [...] " [...] lightness of comic touch". The play was recorded before a live audience and aired on PBS in 2008. In 2007, Garner became a spokesperson of skin care brand Neutrogena.|$|E
