5|$|Scattered objects, {{like other}} trans-Neptunian objects, have low densities and are {{composed}} largely of frozen volatiles {{such as water}} and methane. Spectral analysis of selected Kuiper belt <b>and</b> <b>scattered</b> objects has revealed signatures of similar compounds. Both Pluto and Eris, for instance, show signatures for methane.|$|E
5|$|The planets {{scattered}} {{the majority}} of the small icy bodies inwards, while themselves moving outwards. These planetesimals then scattered off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner, moving the planets' orbits outwards while they moved inwards. This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter, whose immense gravity sent them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejected them outright from the Solar System. This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward. Those objects scattered by Jupiter into highly elliptical orbits formed the Oort cloud; those objects scattered to a lesser degree by the migrating Neptune formed the current Kuiper belt <b>and</b> <b>scattered</b> disc. This scenario explains the Kuiper belt's <b>and</b> <b>scattered</b> disc's present low mass. Some of the scattered objects, including Pluto, became gravitationally tied to Neptune's orbit, forcing them into mean-motion resonances. Eventually, friction within the planetesimal disc made the orbits of Uranus and Neptune circular again.|$|E

5|$|A {{hurricane}} in 1844 {{is said to}} have {{wiped out}} the population of Cuban macaws from Pinar del Río. Subsequent hurricanes in 1846 and 1856 further destroyed their habitat in western Cuba <b>and</b> <b>scattered</b> the remaining population. In addition, a tropical storm hit the Zapata Swamp in 1851. With a healthy macaw population, such events could have been beneficial by creating suitable habitat. However, given the species' precarious position, it may have resulted in fragmented habitat and caused them to seek food in areas where they were more vulnerable to hunting.|$|E
5|$|A lifelong heavy smoker, Turner was {{diagnosed}} with throat cancer in May 1992. At the urging of her daughter, Turner underwent radiation therapy to treat the cancer, and in February 1993, announced {{that she was in}} remission. Despite treatment, the cancer returned in July 1994. In September 1994, she made her final public appearance at the San Sebastián International Film Festival in Spain to accept a Lifetime Achievement Award, and was bound to a wheelchair for much of the event. Turner died nine months later at the age of 74 on June 29, 1995, of complications from the cancer at her home in Century City, Los Angeles, California. Her remains were cremated <b>and</b> <b>scattered</b> in Oahu, Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|At 05:30 on 22 May, the Anglo-Egyptian advance continued, but {{the nature}} of the country, which {{consisted}} mainly of rolling low level sand-hills, with plenty of concealed ground <b>and</b> <b>scattered</b> bushes, reduced visibility down to just a few hundred yards. From the start, large groups of Fur camaliers and cavalry were observed. So instead of sending out his scouts Kelly formed an advance guard of the mounted infantry, a camel company and four Maxim machine guns. At 10:30, the Fur troops were observed in a strong entrenched position around the village of Beringia.|$|E
5|$|Berlin {{surrendered}} on 2 May. Records in the Soviet archives obtained {{after the}} fall of the Soviet Union state that the remains of Hitler, Braun, Joseph and Magda Goebbels, the six Goebbels children, General Hans Krebs, and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg. The remains from the boxes were burned, crushed, <b>and</b> <b>scattered</b> into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the Elbe. According to Kershaw, the corpses of Braun and Hitler were fully burned when the Red Army found them, and only a lower jaw with dental work could be identified as Hitler's remains.|$|E

5|$|High winds {{brought down}} {{telegraph}} wires {{and left the}} city almost entirely cut off from communication with outside locations. At Coney Island, the storm completely destroyed many buildings, walkways, piers, and beach resorts. Brighton Beach was hit particularly hard. The raging seas swept inland, washing out tracks of the Marine Railway. Bathing houses were moved a great distance by the cyclone. Near the Sheepshead Bay, Emmons Avenue was heavily damaged. Further to the east, at Greenport, numerous yachts were wrecked <b>and</b> <b>scattered.</b> Corn crops on land were ruined and fruit trees lost their fruits.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the earthquake, {{multiple}} phone lines were down, <b>and</b> <b>scattered</b> power outages affected about 54,000 households. Moreover, at least 70 underground 11,000 volt cables sustained some degree of damage, contributing to the outages. The shaking ruptured local water mains, resulting in widespread flooding that affected several streets. Furthermore, officials ordered the closure of bridges in the area as a precautionary measure; one bridge was reported to have succumbed to the strong ground motions. Days after its occurrence, a small electrical fire ignited in a control panel at Christchurch Hospital due to dislodged wiring as a result of ongoing aftershocks.|$|E

In this paper, a special framework is developed on the generalized hypercube, a network that is currently receiving considerable attention. Using this framework as the basic tool, a number of spanning graphs with special properties to t various communication needs, are constructed on the network. The importance of these spanning graphs is demonstrated {{with the development of}} optimal algorithms for four fundamen-tal communication problems, namely, the single node and multinode broadcasting and the single node <b>and</b> multinode <b>scattering,</b> on the generalized hypercube network. Broadcasting is the distribution of the same group of messages from a source processor to all other processors, <b>and</b> <b>scattering</b> is the distribution of distinct groups of messages from a source processor to each other processor. We consider broadcasting <b>and</b> <b>scattering</b> from a single processor of the network (single node broadcasting <b>and</b> <b>scattering)</b> <b>and</b> simultaneously from all processors of the network (multinode broadcasting <b>and</b> <b>scattering).</b> For the multinode broadcasting <b>and</b> <b>scattering</b> algorithms a special technique is developed on the generalized hypercube so that messages origi-nating at individual nodes are interleaved in such a manner that no two messages contend for the same edge at any given time.

5|$|Navigating {{through the}} smoke slowed progress, and the mistaken use by the First Canadian Army of yellow smoke to {{identify}} their positions—the same colour strategic bombers used to mark targets—led to some bombing of the Canadians and slower progress than planned.
