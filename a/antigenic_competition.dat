40|$|The {{effects of}} {{cyclophosphamide}} (CY) thymectomy and splenectomy on the <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> in contact hypersensitivity between dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) and picryl chloride (PCI) was investigated. Contact sensitivity of PCI was suppressed by a prior painting of DNFB. When these two sensitizers were painted 7 days apart and CY was injected 3 {{days after the}} painting of DNFB, the <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> did not occur. On the other hand, when CY was injected 3 days before painting of DNFB, the <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> was partially abolished. The <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> was seen in mice 2 weeks after adult thymectomy and in splenectomized mice. However, <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> did not occur in mice 6 weeks after thymectomy.

(c) The affinity of the antibody produced in <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> is approximately equal to the affinity of antibody formed by animals immunized with only one antigen. (d) <b>Antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> only occurs when both antigens are injected so as to drain into the same regional lymph nodes.

40|$|The rapid {{evolution}} of viral pathogens {{requires us to}} consider epidemiological, ecological and evolutionary processes as coupled together and occurring at the same timescale. Rotavirus and influenza account for high levels {{of morbidity and mortality}} worldwide and are two important examples of such dynamics. In this work, I investigate the different evolutionary and ecological processes that shape the antigenic structure and phylogenetic characteristics of these two viruses. In the first part of my work, I use a theoretical model of influenza A/H 3 N 2 to identify the relative importance of <b>antigenic</b> novelty, <b>competition</b> between lineages, and changes in the susceptibility of the host population to circulating strains in determining the evolutionary and epidemiological trajectory of the virus. I develop this model further to correspond with patterns of immunity and infection observed in rotavirus, and investigate how reassortment, the swapping of gene segments between viruses, influences the formation and replacement of rotavirus genotypes through immune mediated processes. In the second part of my work, I use a tool (SeasMig), which I developed, to infer alternative stochastically generated migration and mutation events along phylogenetic trees in a Bayesian manner. Using SeasMig, I first show how the seasonality of A/H 3 N 2 influenza incidence corresponds to rates of immigration and emigration of the virus. Subsequently, I tease out the different evolutionary and ecological processes, which drive changes in the US rotavirus population following onset of routine vaccination. My work has implications for identifying likely evolutionary mechanisms, which may lead to reduced vaccine efficacy, and for vaccine strain selection...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} route of {{administration}} of contact sensitizers on the induction of <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> between dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) and picryl chloride (PCl) and between oxazolone (Ox) and PCl was investigated. <b>Antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> (depressed contact sensitivity to PCl) was induced not only by painting with DNFB via various routes, such as intravenous (i. v.), oral or subcutaneous routes. <b>Antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> was abolished by the treatment with cyclophosphamide (CY) 4 days after i. v. injection of competing DNFB or Ox, and also by thymectomy 6 weeks prior to the injection of DNFB. These results suggest that thymus-derived suppressor cells {{may be involved in}} the <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> induced by the i. v. injection of DNFB. Primary contact sensitivity (CS) was induced by painting of DNFB or Ox and also by i. v. injection of Ox. Although an i. v. injection of DNFB into normal mice did not induce CS, it induced a strong CS in the mice pretreated with CY 2 days prior to the injection of DNFB. Examination on the effect of dose of contact sensitizers on the induction of <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition,</b> primary CS and tolerance by painting or by i. v. injection of DNFB or Ox showed that the degree of <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> has a closer relationship with CS, than with unresponsiveness...|$|E

40|$|When {{presented}} {{together on}} the intact influenza virus particle, the external hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens are competitive, with HA dominant over NA in both T- and B-cell priming (B. E. Johansson, T. M. Moran, and E. D. Kilbourne, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84 : 6869 - 6873, 1987). Dissociation and purification of HA and NA from virus and their injection separately or in combination into BALB/c mice eliminates their <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> as measured by antibody response, confirming that it is their structural association that leads {{to what we have}} termed intravirionic <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition.</b> We discuss this phenomenon with respect to previously described intermolecular <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> and with regard to its probable mechanism.

40|$|The {{frequency}} and antigen-bearing characteristics of dendritic cells (DC) within draining lymph nodes {{have been examined}} during <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> in contact sensitivity. Pre-exposure of mice to oxazolone on the flank resulted in a marked depression of subsequent fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -induced lymph node cell (LNC) proliferation. <b>Antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> was {{associated with an increased}} frequency of DC in the draining lymph nodes, but also with a reduced amount of antigen per cell. Thus, at 24 hr the draining nodes of FITC-challenged mice previously exposed to oxazolone exhibited an increased number of DC compared with control animals. Flow cytometric analysis revealed, however, that the percentage of antigen-bearing DC was reduced and that the median amount of antigen borne by DC was lower. Since exposure to oxazolone caused {{a significant increase in the}} frequency of DC in distant nodes, the changes observed in <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> may, at least in part, be attributable to systemic effects on DC migration following application of the first antigen. These data indicate that the reduced primary proliferative response which characterizes <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> in contact sensitivity is associated with, and may result from, induced changes in dendritic cell behaviour...|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition,</b> {{initiated}} in vivo, but expressed in vitro, {{was developed in}} order to study the cellular basis of <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition.</b> This was initiated by the injection of donkey or chicken red cells 2 days before sacrifice. To permit {{a response to a}} thymus dependent hapten protein conjugate in vitro, it was necessary to prime the mice with the carrier some weeks prior to culture. Thus the response of mice primed with fowl gamma globulin (FGG) to dinitrophenylated (DNP) FGG in vitro was used as the test for <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition.</b> The function of B cells was found to be normal, since the response to a thymus independent antigen, DNP flagella of Salmonella adelaide, was found to be normal, while that to DNP FGG was suppressed. The locus of suppression in <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> was found to be the macrophage, since small numbers (3000) of peritoneal cells which had been depleted of T cells by treatment with anti theta serum and complement restored the response to DNP FGG. Trypsinization of the spleen populations also overcame <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition,</b> indicating that there was no irreversible block of any cell type. Trypsinization did not augment the in vitro response to DNP FGG of noninjected mice or that to DNP FLA of normal or DRC injected mice. Thus, trypsinization overcame competition without augmenting the response of either T or B cells and thus acted to remove a surface inhibitor from the surface of macrophages. The results were interpreted in the light of current concepts of the mechanism of T B collaboration. It is proposed that <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> is a byproduct of the release of complexes of IgT and antigen by T cells. These bind to macrophages, initiating the response to the first antigen, but competing out the binding of IgT complexes to a subsequently administered antigen which are needed to trigger B cells and thus blocking the cooperative response to the second antigen...|$|E
40|$|To {{explore the}} {{mechanisms}} of <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition,</b> immunological and histological studies were made on mice using non-crossreacting heterologous erythrocyte antigens, i. e. sheep (SRBC), horse (HRBC) and chicken (CRBC) erythrocytes. Deficiency in the competition-inducing capacity of CRBC which we demonstrated in a previous paper was corroborated by the results that under any experimental conditions examined CRBC were unable to induce the competition. Of interest in the studies was that when anti-HRBC antibody responses of mice pre-injected with SRBC, i. e. competing antigen, were examined on day 2 and day 4 of HRBC-immunization, the day- 2 response was revealed to be significantly enhanced, whereas the day- 4 -response was markedly suppressed {{as a result of}} the <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition.</b> By contrast, pre-injection with CRBC, i. e. non-competing antigen, did not affect at all either day- 2 or day- 4 anti-HRBC response of mice. Histological features of the spleens of mice either being prepared for <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> or undergoing competitively suppressed antibody response were characterized by prominent regeneration of hyperplastic germinal centres, involving appearance of numerous tingible bodies and distinct collars of small lymphocytes which suggested massive proliferation and degeneration of lymphocytes. The spleens of mice in the immunological state indifferent to <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> were characterized by huge lymphatic follicles which contained very few tingible bodies and were circumscribed by a markedly attenuated zone of small lymphocytes. From all these results, we suggest that massive proliferation and differentiation of T lymphocytes, probably toward regulatory (suppressor) T cells, could account for a mechanism of <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition,</b> and that deficient competition-inducing capacity of CRBC should be ascribed to weakness of their capacity in activation of the regulatory T lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|Various {{mechanisms}} for understanding <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> have been proposed, such as macrophage availability, suppressor cells and their soluble products. In {{view of the}} regulatory function of some hormones on the immune system, the role of immunosuppressive adrenal corticosteroids in <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> was investigated. When horse red blood cells (HRBC) were injected into rats a five-fold increase in corticosterone blood levels was measured by day 6 and a strong decrease was noted on day 11. In animals injected with HRBC and on day 6 with a second antigen (sheep red blood cells, SRBC), the corticosteroid level was high on day 11. Such high levels are immunosuppressive. To impede such increases in adrenal hormone levels, rats were adrenalectomized. Adrenalectomized or sham-operated animals receiving SRBC only showed no difference in plaque-forming cell (PFC) numbers. All sham-operated rats injected first with HRBC and 5 days later with SRBC showed the expected <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition.</b> Adrenalectomized rats also injected with both antigens sequentially had a five fold increase in number of PFC {{when compared with the}} sham-operated controls which had received both antigens. A detailed analysis of these data revealed that a proportion of adrenalectomized animals had PFC numbers within the normal range. In vitro, hydrocortisone enhances the response of spleen cells when only one antigen (SRBC) is present. Prior addition of the unrelated antigen (HRBC) impedes this enhancement. Thus, in a hydrocortisone-enriched culture medium, the presence of the first antigen can interfere with the immune response to the second unrelated antigen, mimicking in vitro a condition of <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition.</b> These findings indicate that hormones may have a role in <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition...</b>|$|E

40|$|Previous {{work has}} {{provided}} evidence that <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> {{is associated with a}} relative deficiency in a thymus cell population created by a disproportionately marked proliferation of nonthymus cellular elements in the maximally stimulated lymphoid tissue (1). 1 Such cellular events were considered to alter the lymphoid microenvironment such that the chance occurrence of cellular interaction for an immune response to the second test antigen in models of <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> was deficient.

40|$|<b>Antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> {{in contact}} {{sensitivity}} {{was found to}} occur between DNFB and PCl and also between some other pairs of non-cross reacting sensitizers. When mice were painted with DNFB 0 - 7 days before the sensitization with PCl, the responsiveness to PCl was suppressed completely, whereas when DNFB was painted after sensitization with PCl, the responsiveness to PCl was affected. The prior application of DNFB resulted in the reduction of DNA synthesis in the draining lymph nodes of PCl-sensitization. This indicated that the suppression by painting with DNFB was not attributable to the inactivation of PCl-specific effector T cells which had already been generated by the sensitization with PCl, but to the inhibition of the generation of PCl-specific effector T cells. The <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> occurred even when two contact sensitizing agents were applied to different lymphoid regions of mice. The suppressive effect of DNFB on the PCl-sensitization was observed also in the mice which had been made tolerant to DNFB.

40|$|Effector {{mechanisms}} that produce delayed hypersensitivity reactions to tuberculin {{are subject to}} positive immunoregulation. Two different immunoregulatory mechanisms can be demonstrated. One is specific and the other, <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition,</b> is non-specific; both are sensitive to cyclophosphamide (CY). Delayed hypersensitivity to purified protein derivative PPD in guinea-pigs can be enhanced by the administration of cyclophosphamide 3 days before but not after immunization. The enhanced response seems to result from the reduced influence on effector cells of CY-sensitive suppressor cells. Passive transfer of delayed hypersensitivity to PPD is facilitated {{by the use of}} cells from CY treated animals. The response to both immunization and skin testing with ovalbumin in animals immunized with this antigen in Freud's complete adjuvant (FCA) produces a marked, non-specific reduction in the delayed hypersensitivity response to PPD. CY given 3 days before or 1 day after immunization prevents this suppression of the PPD response by <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition.</b> The data suggests that in the generation of both the specific suppressor cells for tuberculin and the non-specific suppressor cells of <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition,</b> that can influence effector cells for tuberculin, a period of rapid cell proliferation occurs that renders both mechanisms sensitive to cyclophosphamide...|$|E
40|$|A {{striking}} {{correlation between}} the capacity of an antigen to nonspecifically suppress humoral immune responses of subsequently administered antigens which are non-cross-reacting, i. e. to manifest <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> and produce enlargement of spleen size through cell proliferation, was found. Increase in spleen size was always accompanied by {{a drop in the}} normal proportion of thymus-derived cells to non-thymus-derived cells. Various means of altering the immune response to the initial antigen, and hence, the capacity of that antigen to suppress in a model of <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> were performed and correlated with changes in spleen size and in the proportion of θ-positive cells in the spleen. In all instances, when the experimental condition reduced or abolished <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition,</b> the increase in spleen size and reduction in the proportion of θ-positive cells in the spleen was reduced or abolished. Furthermore, under conditions in which the suppressive capacity of the initial antigen was unaltered, the increase in spleen size and reduction in θ-proportion occurred normally. Finally, the better the suppression in a model of <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition,</b> the greater the increase in spleen size and reduction in the proportion of θ-positive cells. On the basis of these observations, it appears that there is a relationship between spleen enlargement through clonally restricted cell proliferation and the expression of antigenic competition; one cannot have the latter without the former. It is postulated that the immunological lesion associated with <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> resides at the level of interference with cell interaction between thymus-derived antigen-reactive cells and marrow-derived antibody-forming cells. This occurs {{as a result of a}} relative "diluting out" of cells of both populations carrying antigenic specificity differing from the one(s) which induced the dilution effect in the first place. The net effect of this is to decrease the chance of a "hit" or interaction between a marrow-derived and thymus-derived cell of the same specificities. This mechanism, which is compatible with theories of clonal selection, and which in fact is dependent upon them, supports the view that the term "antigenic competition" is a misnomer; there is no competition by the antigens for anything. The term "antigen-induced suppression" is suggested as a more suitable alternative...|$|E
40|$|Since {{previous}} work had {{indicated that the}} mechanism of <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> induced by the injection of red cells was due to a reversible block of cooperation at {{the surface of the}} macrophage, the possibility that the inhibitor was complexes of IgT and antigen resulting from the previous response (to red cells) was investigated. Macrophages were incubated with supernatants from activated T cells (ATC), containing, or deprived of, IgT by incubation with anti-mouse Ig-coated sepharose beads. Macrophages incubated with ATC supernatants were immunogenic for the corresponding antigen, but were not capable of binding a second ATC supernatant, of different antigenic specificity, in an immunogenic way. In contrast, if IgT was previously removed, the macrophages were not immunogenic and were not blocked.

40|$|Several {{experimental}} observations {{appear to}} contradict clonal selection theories of humoral antibody formation (1). One {{of these is}} <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition,</b> a phenomenon whereby the immune response to one antigen can nonspecifically suppress the immune response of a non-cross-reacting antigen administered subsequently (2).

40|$|AbstractWhen {{hemagglutinin}} (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) {{are presented}} together on an intact influenza virus particle, the antigens are competitive, with HA dominant over NA in T- and B-cell priming.

The results suggested <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> mediated by immune complex-activated suppressor T cells. Lipid-free GTA did not stimulate serum antibody responses under the experimental conditions employed...|$|E
40|$|Intradermal {{inoculation}} of the guinea-pig with Leishmania enriettii {{results in}} a self-healing cutaneous lesion which provides a laboratory model of human cutaneous leishmaniasis and which is dominated by cell-mediated immunological responses (Bryceson et al., 1970). In this study we sought to design experimental situations resembling non-healing forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis in man and to determine whether these experimental situations were accompanied by abnormalities in the immunological response to infection. This paper describes three procedures which impair the resistance of guinea-pigs to leishmanial infection: (i) induction of partial immunological tolerance to leishmanial antigen; (ii) systemic injection of anti-lymphocyte serum (ALS); and (iii) regional <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> produced by multiple injections of bacterial adjuvants...|$|E
40|$|Intraperitoneal {{injection}} of young adult NZB mice with Freund's complete adjuvant emulsion, alone or incorporating BALB/c mouse erythrocytes, resulted in accelerated direct Coombs conversion {{and development of}} splenomegaly. Incorporation of adjuvant with NZB erythrocytes caused an accelerated reactivity in some animals, but in others resulted in a delayed Coombs conversion. In contrast, positive Coombs tests failed to develop at all in NZB mice injected with a Freund's complete adjuvant preparation containing ten times the usual amount of Mycobacterium. These observations might be explained {{in part by the}} relative influences of adjuvancy and of <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition</b> on the availability of precursor cells capable of responding to autoantigenic stimulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{different}} {{components of}} the immune response to hapten-carrier conjugates have been supposed to interact with each other. In order to elucidate the interrelationship between hapten and carrier moieties of the antigen molecule at the cellular level, the homologous carrier alone or the hapten conjugated to an heterologous carrier were injected before immunization with the hapten-carrier conjugate. Delayed hypersensitivity to the carrier could be depressed by pretreatment with the hapten or with the carrier depending on which time interval was chosen to elapse between the two injections. The results {{could be explained by}} <b>antigenic</b> <b>competition,</b> occurring at the cellular level, between hapten and carrier moieties of the antigen molecule...|$|E
