5|$|The studio {{also put}} {{together}} a trailer of scenes and images strictly from the first three minutes of the film, in which Andrea meets Miranda for the first time, to be used at previews and film festivals until they could create a more standard trailer drawing from the whole film. But, again, this proved so effective with early audiences it was retained as the main trailer, since it created anticipation {{for the rest of}} the film without giving <b>anything</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
5|$|You {{are going}} to have a four-lane highway through Wyoming. You {{are going to}} build two four-lane {{highways}} through New Mexico and Arizona. Colorado needs to be able to compete with our neighboring states. We do not want to take <b>anything</b> <b>away</b> from them. We do not want them to get way out ahead of us, either, because these interstate highways are going to be very attractive highways for the East and West to travel on.|$|E

500|$|Graham praised {{his opponents}} – [...] "There {{is no need}} to take <b>anything</b> <b>away</b> from Liverpool because they were terrific," [...] and felt his team could have been more clinical.

500|$|Bill Drummond {{summed up}} The JAMs' {{approach}} to composition {{in the first}} [...] "KLF Information Sheet", sent out in October 1987: [...] "We made [...] not giving a shit for soul boy snob values or any other values, we just went in and made the noise we wanted to hear and the stuff {{that came out of}} our mouths.... Not a pleasant sound but it's the noise we had. We pressed it up and stuck it out. A celebration of sorts." [...] Jimmy Cauty defended sampling as an artistic practice: [...] "It's not as if we're taking <b>anything</b> <b>away,</b> just borrowing and making things bigger. If you're creative you aren't going to stop working just because there is a law against what you are doing." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Her Majesty" [...] was {{recorded}} by McCartney on 2 July {{when he arrived}} {{before the rest of}} the group at Abbey Road. It was included in a rough mix of the side two medley, appearing between [...] "Mean Mr. Mustard" [...] and [...] "Polythene Pam". McCartney disliked the way the medley sounded when it included [...] "Her Majesty", so he asked for it to be cut. The second engineer, John Kurlander, had been instructed not to throw out anything, so after McCartney left, he attached the track to the end of the master tape after 20seconds of silence. The tape box bore an instruction to leave [...] "Her Majesty" [...] off the final product, but the next day when mastering engineer Malcolm Davies received the tape, he (also trained not to throw <b>anything</b> <b>away)</b> cut a playback lacquer of the whole sequence, including [...] "Her Majesty". The Beatles liked this effect and included it on the album.|$|E
500|$|On 20 May 2012, York regained their Football League {{status with}} {{promotion}} to League Two after a 2–1 win over Luton in the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium. Luton {{took the lead}} when Andre Gray scored in the second minute, before Chambers scored the equaliser on 26 minutes with a low shot from a Smith hooked cross. The winner came two minutes into the second half after Blair, despite being in an offside position, scored from close range after latching onto Parslow's header. After the match, Blair {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I scored the goal and it feels unbelievable but I'm not taking <b>anything</b> <b>away</b> from the other lads today. The back five, and Daniel Parslow in front, defended like heroes and were brilliant all game". Mills summarised York's achievements by saying [...] "To come to Wembley Stadium two weeks running and do the double is an incredible feeling. In fact, with the ground announcement, it's been a terrific treble and probably the best hat-trick ever at York City Football Club".|$|E
500|$|The Spanish {{media has}} often {{compared}} Villa with Raúl, {{to the point}} where Villa was accused of taking the number 7 jersey away from the then-Real Madrid player. In March 2009, Villa spoke out, saying, [...] "I have not taken <b>anything</b> <b>away</b> from anybody, I was simply playing well for my club and the national coach gave me an opportunity. Too much has been said about the number issue. I’m not looking to cause any controversy. In fact, Raúl and I were in the national squad together in the past. I haven’t forced anybody out." [...] When questioned on whether the whole uproar created over Raúl's omission was affecting him personally, he said, [...] "I've never liked it because I think it has been damaging for the both of us. We've always got on well together whenever we've met up for international duty, so I'm not concerned. I just work hard for myself. All I want is to be in the squad for every game, to have the Spain badge on my chest and to score as many goals as I can." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 2007, Avi Arad {{revealed}} a Venom spin-off {{was in the}} works. The studio commissioned Jacob Aaron Estes to write a script, but rejected it the following year. In September 2008, Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese signed on to write. Stan Lee signed on to make a cameo in the film. Rhett Reese later revealed that they had written two drafts for the film and that the studio was pushing the film forward. In 2009, Gary Ross, who was then rewriting the latest draft of the unproduced Spider-Man 4, was assigned to rewrite the Venom script and direct the film, in which Venom would be an antihero rather than a supervillain. In March 2012, Chronicle director Josh Trank negotiated with Sony about his interest in directing the film after Ross left development to direct The Hunger Games. In June 2012, The Amazing Spider-Man producer Matt Tolmach, speaking of his and fellow producer Avi Arad's next project, a Venom film, suggested it could follow the shared-universe model of the film The Avengers: [...] "What I'm trying {{to say to you}} without giving <b>anything</b> <b>away</b> is hopefully all these worlds will live together in peace someday." ...|$|E

2500|$|Moses exhorted the Israelites to heed God's laws, not to add {{anything}} to them, {{and not to}} take <b>anything</b> <b>away</b> from them, {{so that they might}} live to enter and occupy the land that God was giving them.

2500|$|Afterwards, the Bears {{returned}} home {{and beat the}} Jets 38–34 in a shootout before traveling to the [...] "Frozen Tundra" [...] of Lambeau Field for Week 17. Their arch-rival only needed to lose this game {{to be removed from}} playoff contention, and so Lovie Smith decided to play Chicago's starters. He also apparently ran generic plays to avoid giving <b>anything</b> <b>away</b> to the Packers for the playoffs, but the offense again sputtered and Green Bay won a 10–3 defensive struggle to secure a wild card playoff berth.|$|E

2500|$|On June 15, Ichiro {{recorded}} his 4,257 career hit, breaking Pete Rose's all-time record for hits in top tier professional baseball.

This was in response to the Japanese media labeling Ichiro as the [...] "Hit King", claiming that Ichiro should be considered to be the all-time hits leader when his hits in Japan are included.|$|E
