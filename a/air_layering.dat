For bonsai, both ground layering and <b>air</b> <b>layering</b> can create a potential bonsai, by transforming a mature branch into the trunk of a new tree. The point at which rooting is encouraged can be close to the location of side branches, so the resulting rooted tree can immediately have a thick trunk and low branches, characteristics that complement bonsai aesthetics.|$|E

Varying the width, location and direction of rectangular opended edges and the width of <b>air</b> <b>layer,</b> the following results are obtained; 1) The efficiency of vapor discharge is fairly small when the upper edge is opened and the lower edge is closed, and is extremely poor when vice versa. 2) When slits with width of less than 2 cm are opened at the both edges of vertical <b>air</b> <b>layer,</b> the efficiency of vapor discharge is positively affected by the thickness of <b>air</b> <b>layer,</b> given the width of slits.

40|$|In {{partially}} flooded {{deep water}} rice (Oryza sativa L. cv Habiganj Aman II), continuous <b>air</b> <b>layers</b> trapped between the hydrophobic, corrugated {{surface of the}} leaf blades and the surrounding water constitute the major path of aeration. The conduction of gases through the internal air spaces of the leaf is negligible compared to the conduction of gases through the external <b>air</b> <b>layers.</b> The total volume of the <b>air</b> <b>layers</b> {{on both sides of}} a leaf blade is about 45 % of the volume of the leaf blade itself. The size of the <b>air</b> <b>layers</b> around submerged leaf blades of cereals not adapted to conditions of partial flooding, e. g. of oats, barley, and wheat, is considerably smaller than that of rice. Gases move through the <b>air</b> <b>layers</b> not only by diffusion but also by mass flow. In darkness, air is drawn down from the atmosphere through the <b>air</b> <b>layers</b> along a pressure gradient created by solubilization of respiratory CO 2 in the surrounding water. In light, photosynthetic O 2 is expelled through the <b>air</b> <b>layers</b> to the atmosphere because the solubility of O 2 in water is much lower than that of CO 2. <b>Air</b> <b>layers</b> greatly increase the rate of photosynthetic carbon fixation by enlarging the surface of the gas-liquid interface available for CO 2 uptake from the water. <b>Air</b> <b>layers</b> are vital for the survival of the partially submerged rice plant. When leaves are washed with a dilute solution of a surfactant (Triton X- 100), no <b>air</b> <b>layers</b> are formed under water. Plants without <b>air</b> <b>layers</b> do not grow in response to submergence, and the submerged parts of the plant deteriorate as evident by rapid loss of chlorophyll and protein. <b>Air</b> <b>layers</b> provide a significant survival advantage even to completely submerged rice plants...|$|R

40|$|Since {{there are}} no large natural energy {{resources}} in Belarus, energy savings {{ought to be a}} point of the special attention. With this regard it is important to develop modern ways of savings during the process of air conditioning inside new buildings with an <b>air</b> <b>layer</b> in the enclosure, especially in translucent ones. The system of ventilation of <b>air</b> <b>layers</b> in the enclosure of a building has been introduced in which air movement is caused by the gravitational and aerodynamic forces. It makes it possible to arrange further ventilation – a natural, forced or a hybrid one. With the purpose of increasing and streamlining natural draught the partitions are used separating the different parts of <b>air</b> <b>layers.</b> For natural ventilation with the use of gravitational forces the holes in the upper and lower parts of the partitions between adjacent <b>air</b> <b>layers</b> are applied. Natural ventilation in the holes of the partitions is regulated by movable shutters, blinds or other adjusting devices. For combined or forced air exchange between adjacent zones of <b>air</b> <b>layers</b> fans are used pumping air from the <b>air</b> <b>layer</b> zones with a higher temperature to zones of <b>air</b> <b>layers</b> with lower temperature and vice versa. When air exchange is forced, in order to intensify the infiltration of air into zones of <b>air</b> <b>layers</b> jets are laid on a hard surface. In order to cool a multi-layered enclosure of a building, where the movement of air between the <b>air</b> <b>layers</b> (that have been formed by internal partitions) is being fulfilled by a natural, forced or combined mode, a part of the air or the total air processed inside the building (i. e. conditioned or non-conditioned air cooler as compared with the outside one) is being sent to these strata. Combined or forced flow of the air processed inside the building into the <b>air</b> <b>layers</b> is done through the ducts associated with the output channels of the air conditioners. The internal partitions are equipped with the air valve hole. </p...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{commented on the}} {{presence}} of midtroposphere dry <b>air</b> <b>layers</b> in normally moist areas of the warm-pool region in the tropical western Pacific Ocean. In this study, 5 yr of relative humidity (RH) observations from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument aboard the Aqua satellite are analyzed to identify areas of anomalously dry air between 600 and 400 hPa over deep convective regions of the tropical oceans. A dry <b>air</b> <b>layer</b> is defined when midlevel RH is, 20 %, accounting for the lowest 10 % of RH observations. Dry <b>air</b> <b>layers</b> appear to be more frequent over the Indian and Pacific Oceans than over the Atlantic Ocean. Large seasonal differences in the locations of dry <b>air</b> <b>layers</b> are apparent in each ocean basin. Large variations are also noted across the Pacific, suggesting limits on the applicability of case-study trends and observations of dry <b>air</b> <b>layers</b> to the Pacific as a whole. Back trajectories are then calculated for each observed parcel. The origin, or location of dehydration, is identified as the point along each trajectory at which the RH of the parcel is$ 100 %.
