50|$|Whilst {{working in}} {{military}} research NUTZ in Neubabelsberg in 1901, Wilm discovered <b>age</b> <b>hardening,</b> in particular <b>age</b> <b>hardening</b> of aluminium alloys. This discovery was made after hardness measurements on Al-Cu alloy specimens were serendipitously found {{to increase in}} hardness at room temperature. This increase in hardness was identified after his measurements were interrupted by a weekend, {{and when they were}} resumed on the Monday the hardness had increased.|$|E
50|$|Individual {{contributions}} of gadolinium and yttrium to <b>age</b> <b>hardening</b> and {{high temperature strength}} of magnesium alloys containing both elements are investigated using alloys containing different Gd : Y mole ratios of 1:0, 1:1, 1:3, and 0:1 with a constant Y+Gd content of 2.75 mol%. All investigated alloys exhibit remarkable <b>age</b> <b>hardening</b> by precipitation of β phase with DO19 crystal structure and β phase with BCO crystal structure, even at aging temperatures higher than 200 °C. Both precipitates are observed in peak-aged specimens. The precipitates contributing to <b>age</b> <b>hardening</b> are fine and their amount increases as Gd content increases, and this result in increased peak hardness, tensile strength and 0.2% proof stress but decreased elongation. On the other hand, higher Y content increases the elongation of the alloys but results in decreased strength.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{precipitate}} {{behavior of}} copper {{in the high}} purity structural steel was investigated by means of transmission electron microscope (TEM), and <b>aging</b> <b>hardening</b> mechanism was investigated based on the corresponding phase transformation mechanism. The results show that lots of Cu rich clusters exist in supersaturated ferrite matrix in solid solution, which evolve to B 2 -like structure during aging. It is found that the hardening in the initial stage {{is controlled by the}} coherency relationship of the B 2 -like structure with matrix that forms the obstacle of the dislocation motion, while the decrease in hardness after the peak is attributed to the loss of coherency, which should highly likely be the dominant reason of <b>aging</b> <b>hardening</b> in Cu bearing high purity steels...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to further develop a sensor system which can be used to continuously monitor the aging response of heat treatable aluminum alloys. This type of system would allow for 'real time' evaluation of alloy properties as the material is <b>age</b> <b>hardened.</b> Such continuous monitoring, coupled with a control system, is referred to as 'intelligent processing'. The system consists of eddy current coils incorporated in an impedance bridge circuit, this allows for continuous monitoring of the resistivity difference between a pure aluminum reference sample and the aluminum alloy as it <b>age</b> <b>hardens.</b> This resistivity change {{is a measure of the}} change in the alloys microstructure. This system will allow for active control over the formal product of an alloy subjected to single- or multi-stage heat treatment thus leading to a higher reliability of engineering structures.

50|$|As {{for many}} of the {{aluminium}} alloys, Y alloy <b>age</b> <b>hardens</b> spontaneously at normal temperatures after solution heat treating. The heat treatment is to heat it to 500 to 520 C for 6 hours, then to allow it to age naturally for 7-10 days. The precipitation hardening that takes place during this ageing forms precipitates of both CuAl2 and NiAl3.|$|R

50|$|Duralumin, an {{aluminium}} alloy containing 4% copper was already known at this time.

25|$|As {{for many}} of the {{aluminium}} alloys, Yalloy <b>age</b> <b>hardens</b> spontaneously at normal temperatures after solution heat treating. In contrast, R.R. alloys remain soft afterwards, until deliberately heat treated again by precipitation <b>hardening</b> for artificial <b>ageing.</b> This simplifies their machining in the soft state, particularly where component blanks are made by a subcontractor and must be shipped to another site before machining. For R.R.56 the solution treatment is to quench from 530°C and ageing is carried out at 175°C. For R.R.50, the solution treatment may be omitted and the metal taken directly to precipitation hardening (155°C-170°C).|$|R

Meanwhile, fibers of second phase also increase in the extruded alloys when the Nd/Gd value increases. However, the Nd/Gd ratio could hardly influence the mechanical properties of the extruded alloys.

50|$|Inconel is a {{difficult}} metal to shape and machine using traditional techniques due to rapid work hardening. After the first machining pass, work hardening tends to plastically deform either the workpiece or the tool on subsequent passes. For this reason, age-hardened Inconels such as 718 are machined using an aggressive but slow cut with a hard tool, minimizing the number of passes required. Alternatively, {{the majority of the}} machining can be performed with the workpiece in a solutionized form, with only the final steps being performed after <b>age</b> <b>hardening.</b>|$|E

All experiments were performed, in load control using M(T), specimens. Crack closure was monitored in the tests by the compliance technique using a pin microgauge. A strong material dependence effects on the fatigue crack growth were observed. The crack growth behavior of heat-treated aluminum alloys depends mainly on whether the dominant closure mechanism is plasticity-induced or roughness-induced. The enhancement of roughness-induced closure promotes higher crack growth resistance in these alloys.
