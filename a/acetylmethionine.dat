50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of oxidoreductases, {{specifically}} those acting on a sulfur group of donors with a disulfide as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-methionine:thioredoxin-disulfide S-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include fSMsr, methyl sulfoxide reductase I and II, <b>acetylmethionine</b> sulfoxide reductase, methionine sulfoxide reductase, L-methionine:oxidized-thioredoxin S-oxidoreductase, methionine-S-oxide reductase, and free-methionine (S)-S-oxide reductase. This enzyme participates in methionine metabolism.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of a cysteine residue(s) near the active site of acylpeptide hydrolase was suggested by inactivation of the enzyme with sulfhydryl-modifying agents and by the substantial protection against inactivation afforded by the competitive inhibitor <b>acetylmethionine.</b> 5, 5 '-dithiobis-(2 -nitrobenzoate) titrations of the native and the denatured enzyme together with analysis for cysteic acid after performic acid oxidation showed that the enzyme contained 12 free SH groups and three disulfide bonds/monomer. Chemical modification with radiolabeled iodoacetamide led to the labeling of Cys- 30 and Cys- 64 suggesting that {{one or both of}} these Cys residues are close to the active site. Modification of one or both of them probably inhibits the enzyme either because of a distortion of the active site or because the adducts present a barrier to the efficient diffusion of substrates into and products out of the active site. Studies on the mechanism of action of acylpeptide hydrolase have employed p-nitrophenyl-N-propyl carbamate as a potent active site-directed inhibitor. Enzyme inactivation, which follows pseudo first-order kinetics, is diminished by the competitive inhibitor <b>acetylmethionine.</b> The inhibited enzyme slowly regains activity at a rate that is increased in the {{presence of}} the nucleophile hydroxylamine. A general mechanism involving an acyl-enzyme intermediate is supported by evidence for the formation of acetyl-alanyl hydroxamate during hydrolysis of acetyl-alanine p-nitroanilide in the presence of hydroxylamine. The effect on Vmax and Km during this reaction indicate that hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate is rate-limiting...|$|E
40|$|Choline citrate (CC) and <b>acetylmethionine</b> (AM) are lipotropic drugs used {{in several}} {{pharmaceutical}} formulations. The {{objective of this}} research was to develop and validate a high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for simultaneous determination of CC and AM in injectable solutions, aiming its application in routine analysis for quality control of these pharmaceutical formulations. The method was validated using a Shim-Pack (R) C 18 (250 x 4. 6 mm, 5 mu m) column. The mobile phase was constituted of 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution, pH 5. 7, adjusted with 10 % orthophosphoric acid, acetonitrile and methanol (88 : 10 : 2, v/v/v). The flow rate was 1. 1 mL. min(- 1) and the UV detection was made at 210 nm. The analyses were made at room temperature (25 +/- 1 degrees C). The method is precise, selective, accurate and robust, and was successfully applied for simultaneous quantitative determination of CC and AM in injectables...|$|E
40|$|Glutathione reductase (Glr 1) {{is a low}} {{abundance}} protein {{involved in}} defense mechanisms against reactive oxygen species. Expressed on cytosolic ribosomes, the same gene, GLR 1, uses alternative start codons to generate two forms of Glr 1. Translation from the first AUG codon generates the mitochondrial form incorporating a presequence necessary for import; translation from the second AUG codon yields the cytosolic counterpart. Proteomic strategies were {{used to analyze the}} N-terminal sequences and the turnover of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Glr 1. The N-terminus of cytosolic Glr 1 was found normally to be N-acetylserine. When a Glr 1 -overproducing strain was employed, unprocessed mitochondrial Glr- 1 with N-terminal <b>acetylmethionine</b> also accumulated in the cytosol. The processed mitochondrial Glr 1 was surprisingly found to have three alternative N-termini, none of them acetylated. Mitochondrial Glr 1 was turned over faster than the cytosolic form by a factor of about 2, consistent with the importance of redox homeostasis in the mitochondria. These experiments also allowed us to estimate the extent of “leaky scanning” in the synthesis of Glr 1. Surprisingly, the second AUG appears to be responsible for most of the cellular Glr 1. This is the first report of protein turnover measurements of a low-abundance protein distributed in different compartments of a eukaryotic cell...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} {{reported}} in this Research Communication {{was to investigate the}} effect of a combined <b>acetylmethionine,</b> cyanocobalamin and α-lipoic acid treatment, on some metabolic parameters of early lactating high-yielding dairy cows. Thirty cows were randomly divided into two groups: experimental group (EG, n = 20) and control group (CG, n = 10). EG received 20 ml of treatment and CG received 20 ml of placebo. The treatments were administered for seven times every 2 d. Blood samples were collected from all cows at 3 time points: 10 ± 2, 30 ± 2 and 50 ± 2 d postpartum. Glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), triglycerides, total cholesterol (TC), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamiltransferase (GGT), total bilirubin (TB), conjugated bilirubin (CB), total proteins (TP), globulins, albumin and urea concentrations were determined. Two-way repeated measure analysis of variance was applied. Significant differences in the values of glucose, BHB, NEFA, triglycerides, TC, AST and urea were found between EG and CG. Moreover, the increased glucose, TC, ALT, GGT, TP and globulins, and the reduced BHB, NEFA, AST, triglycerides, TB, CB and urea concentrations were evident in both groups, but the changes were more pronounced in EG. Our findings indicate that our treatment positively influenced liver metabolism in high-yielding dairy cows...|$|E
40|$|The {{coding region}} {{nucleotide}} sequences of rat, hamster, and bovine S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) cDNA exhibit over 90 % homology {{with the human}} sequence. No N-terminal amino acid could be detected when either bovine or rat AdoMetDC was subjected to Edman degradation, suggesting that the β-subunit must be blocked since the pyruvate residue {{is located at the}} amino terminus of the α-subunit. In this study, we present the primary structure, including post-translational modification, of rat prostate AdoMetDC. Our strategy was to compare the molecular masses of peptides produced by five specific cleavage methods with peptides expected from the known cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of rat AdoMetDC using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). All AdoMetDC peptide fragments produced by the five cleavage methods could be assigned to theoretical peptides based on the rat cDNA sequence except for the peptides containing the N-terminus of the β- and α-subunits. The N-terminus of the α-subunit was assigned as pyruvoyl peptide. Liberation of <b>acetylmethionine</b> was demonstrated when the peptide containing the β-subunit N-terminal amino acid obtained by lysylendopeptidase digestion was reacted with acylamino acidreleasing enzyme. Furthermore, N-terminal acetylation of the β-subunit was confirmed by MALDI-post source decay analysis. In conclusion, {{the results of the present}} study on amino acid full sequence of rat prostate AdoMetDC determined by the combination of five specific cleavage methods demonstrate that the N-terminus of the β-subunit is acetylated, and the expected amino acid sequence based on the rat AdoMetDC cDNA sequence is correct...|$|E
