This research explores {{the hypothesis that}} the failure behaviour of {{mining equipment}} is influenced by the physical properties of the ore and waste. We describe a method of examining this relationship via data mining on maintenance records and apply it to the hydraulic cylinders of two classes of earthmoving mobile equipment.

The results show that the distributions of the estimated life parameters for hydraulic cylinders on earthmoving equipment are distinctly different for haematite iron, coal, and nickel sulphide sites. Analysis of the relationship between selected physical properties identified the influence of rock impact hardness number, <b>abrasion</b> <b>index,</b> and absolute hardness of the ore as significant factors for these hydraulic cylinders.

40|$|Currently in South Africa {{there is}} no {{acceptable}} standard method for testing coals for abrasion. Abrasion is the tendency of coals to wear away machinery. The technique referred to as YGP (Yancey, Geer and Price), proposed and accepted in 1951, is most commonly used to test for abrasion. Over the years {{there have been some}} modifications to this method by both mining houses and coal users (such as Eskom) which have resulted in inconsistent and conflicting results. To this end, this study serves {{as part of a larger}} project that will aim at devising a standard method acceptable for testing coals for abrasion in South Africa. The underlying principle behind this research was to determine the main characteristics in South African run of mine (ROM) coals that may cause abrasion. This research work specifically seeks to: (1) determine if the <b>Abrasion</b> <b>Index</b> (AI) and Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI), empirical correlations, developed by Scieszka (1985), can be verified using experimental results; (2) determine if excluded minerals and included minerals are equally abrasive; (3) establish the type of abrasive wear that occurred during coal grinding. Five ROM coals from the Witbank Coalfields were analysed. An <b>abrasion</b> <b>index</b> tester pot and Hardgrove machine were used to determine the grinding properties of the coal samples. XRD (Rietveld method), XRF, Petrography and SEM-EDS were used to characterise the coals samples in terms of their inorganic and organic components. SEM-EDS was also used for the particle morphology analysis, and blade surface topography analysis. TGA, moisture oven and sieve method were used for proximate analysis, moisture analysis, and particle size distribution analysis respectively. The results indicated that the key characteristics that influenced the AI of the coal samples were moisture, vitrinite, and minerals and mineral associations (excluded and included minerals and carbominerite) and HGI. Results indicated that coal weathering renders coals less abrasive, compared to unweathered coals. It was concluded that AI and HGI are experimentally dependent; excluded and included minerals were equally abrasive; and three-body abrasive wear was established to be the main wear during grinding in an <b>abrasion</b> <b>index</b> tester pot...|$|E

Overall, the Muko ore was found to have good mechanical properties exemplified with tumble and shatter index data > 89. 0 [*]wt% and < 2. 5 [*]wt%, respectively. Furthermore, its reducibility at 0. 87 %/min is within the acceptable range as a natural material feed for blast furnace and direct reduction furnaces.

Mature terrestrial sands are dominated by quartz, which is abundant in source lithologies on Earth and is physically and chemically stable under a wide range of conditions while immature sands, such as those rich in feldspars or mafic minerals, are composed of grains that are easily physically weathered and highly susceptible to chemical weathering. On Mars, which is predominantly mafic in composition, terrestrial standards of sediment maturity are not applicable. In addition, the martian climate today is cold, dry and sediments are likely to be heavily influenced by physical weathering instead of chemical weathering.

Although many research works have been conducted, further investigation {{on the effect of}} chemical compositions (MgO, A 2 O 3, Basicity) on the sinter quality is still required for further improvement of the sinter and more alternative additives are still being tested. In this project, a sinter pot has been used to manufacture sinters, which were characterized using point-counting to quantify the different phases and X-Ray diffraction to identify the polymorphic forms of Ca 2 SiO 4 of the silicate phases. The produced sinters were evaluated with respect to reducibility index (RI), reduction degradation index (RDI), physical breakdown (TI and AI), and production properties (yield, coke breeze rate and production rate). The influence of ignition temperature, magnesium oxide, alumina addition and basicity on the mineralogy as well as physical and chemical properties of iron ore sinters were investigated. Results were obtained as follows: For the Base case with a basicity of 2, 2. 8 mass% MgO content, 1. 7 mass % Al 2 O 3 and 10 mass% CaO, the effect of ignition temperature, which ranged between 864 oC and 1100 oC, on the sinter quality was investigated. Results showed that the ignition temperature had an effect on the sinter properties: reducibility (RI), physical strength (TI and AI), production properties (yield, coke breeze rate and production rate). The temperature 1053 oC was the best ignition temperature for an economically acceptable sinter. A further increase in ignition temperature was found to form melt {{on the surface of the}} sinter produced, leading to a sinter of low quality. Also, X-rays diffraction pattern showed that the allotropic transformation of the Ca 2 SiO 4 did not take place. The Low SiO 2 – Low Al 2 O 3 sinter had the highest reducibility index and had the highest <b>Abrasion</b> <b>index</b> and the lowest coke breeze rate at 2. 8 mass% MgO content compared to all the sinters produced in this project. For the High SiO 2 – Low Al 2 O 3 sinter MgO was added through dolomite and fused magnesia. A comparative study on the effect of dolomite and fused magnesia was conducted. The sinter to which fused magnesia was added had lower reducibility, higher reduction degradation, higher tumble index, lower <b>abrasion</b> <b>index</b> and lower coke breeze rate than the sinter to which dolomite was added. High SiO 2 – High Al 2 O 3 sinter had the lowest reducibility index, the lowest reduction degradation, the lowest tumbler index and the highest coke breeze rate.

Three geosynthetics (geotextile, geogrid and geocomposite) were submitted to mechanical damage and <b>abrasion</b> damage using <b>index</b> laboratory tests. The geosynthetics were exposed first individually to each agent (single exposure) and then sequentially to the two agents (multiple exposures). To ensure the results were statistical representative, each set of tests was performed three times. The consequences of the damage induced were visible (naked eye). Abrasion damage was found the most critical damage mechanism for the tensile properties, particularly for the geogrid and geocomposite tested. The connections between their components created potential fragility points in the abrasion test. Due to its structure, combined with high mass per unit area and thickness, the geotextile tested survived well the damage induced. A positive synergy between the mechanical and the abrasion damage induced was found for the tensile properties of the geosynthetics most affected by damage, more important for their tensile strength than for their secant stiffness. The mechanical damage was the most critical mechanism for the permittivity of the geotextile and the geocomposite, likely due to clogging of their pores. For the permittivity and the characteristic opening size of these geosynthetics, negative synergy between mechanical and abrasion damage was found; the traditional approach was found {{likely to result in}} unsafe estimates of these properties...|$|R

Considering the fact, in this study, a facile fabrication method of highly cut resistant composite fabrics using Kevlar and polyethylene is reported. 100 % Kevlar, 100 % Polyethylene and 50 % Kevlar/ 50 % Polyethylene composite fabrics are fabricated by weaving and knitting techniques. These fabrics were tested for cut <b>index,</b> <b>abrasion,</b> and puncture resistance for comparative exploration. Owing to higher mechanical strength and greater number of interlacements; the woven fabrics demonstrated twice cut resistance in contrast to knitted fabrics. The surface morphology of deformed samples investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) also proved that the woven fabrics of all types offered much resistance towards cutting than the knitted fabrics. Moreover, it is found that greater thickness of fabrics leads to intensification of the cut resistance. Furthermore, the effect of fiber type on cut resistant property of the fabrics was also measured and it was found that the composite fabric exhibited double cut resistance than 100 % Kevlar and 100 % Polyethylene fabrics. The 50 % Kevlar/ 50 % Polyethylene composite woven fabric resisted up to 35 consecutive strokes of sharp steel cutter whereas the knitted fabric completely torn apart at 20 strokes only. Thus, the as synthesized 50 % Kevlar/ 50 % Polyethylene composite woven fabric exhibiting superior cut resistance property offer a judicious choice for the preparation of efficient cut resistant fabric for industrial and domestic applications.|$|R

40|$|Unexpected {{issues were}} {{encountered}} during the Apollo era of lunar exploration due to detrimental abrasion of materials upon {{exposure to the}} fine-grained, irregular shaped dust {{on the surface of}} the Moon. For critical design features involving contact with the lunar surface and for astronaut safety concerns, operational concepts and dust tolerance must be considered in the early phases of mission planning. To systematically define material selection criteria, dust interaction can be characterized by two-body or three-body abrasion testing, and subcategorically by physical interactions of compression, rolling, sliding and bending representing specific applications within the system. Two-body abrasion occurs when a single particle or asperity slides across a given surface removing or displacing material. Three-body abrasion occurs when multiple particles interact with a solid surface, or in between two surfaces, allowing the abrasives to freely rotate and interact with the material(s), leading to removal or displacement of mass. Different modes of interaction are described in this paper along with corresponding types of tests that can be utilized to evaluate each configuration. In addition to differential modes of abrasion, variable concentrations of dust in different zones can also be considered for a given system design and operational protocol. These zones include: (1) outside the habitat where extensive dust exposure occurs, (2) in a transitional zone such as an airlock or suitport, and (3) inside the habitat or spacesuit with a low particle count. These zones can be used to help define dust interaction frequencies, and corresponding risks to the systems and/or crew can be addressed by appropriate mitigation strategies. An <b>abrasion</b> <b>index</b> is introduced that includes the level of risk, R, the hardness of the mineralogy, H, the severity of the abrasion mode, S, and the frequency of particle interactions, F...|$|E
30|$|All {{mixtures}} {{were prepared}} in a compulsory mixer with total mixing time of 8  min. Coarse and fine sand and powder materials (cement, LSP, RHA) were mixed in dry {{conditions for a}} period of 2  min. Next, about 80  % of the water was added, whereupon the concrete mixture was mixed for 2  min. Finally, about 20  % of the water and superplasticizer were added and the concrete mixture was mixed for 4  min. Slump test were conducted to evaluate workability of mixtures according to ASTM C 143. Cylinders of 150  ×  300  mm 2 were cast for determination of compressive and splitting tensile strength. Cylinders of 100  ×  200  mm 2 were cast for determination of chloride penetration resistance. Cube specimens of 70.7  ×  70.7  ×  70.7  mm 3 were cast for determination of abrasion resistance. All specimens were compacted in two layers on a vibrating table. Each layer was vibrated for 20  s. The moulds were covered with polyethylene sheets and moistened for 24  h. After 1  day, the specimens were demoulded, and stored in water at 20  ±  2  °C until testing at 3, 7, and 28  days. Compressive and splitting tensile strength of concrete were determined in agreement with ASTM C 39 and ASTM C 496, respectively. Chloride penetration resistance was determined at 28  days in agreement with ASTM C 1202. The tests were carried out in triplicate and the average values were reported. Abrasion resistance of HPFGC was determined at 28  days following Böhme method (CEN 2003). A dried specimen is held in contact with a cast iron disc with a pressure of 0.6  daN/cm 2. The disc rotates at 30  ±  1  rpm. For each specimen, the disc runs 140 revolutions. During the process, the specimen is progressively rotated through 90 o, and sand with maximum particle size of 2  mm is spread on the disc. The <b>abrasion</b> <b>index</b> (g/mm 2) is calculated by dividing the mass loss of each specimen by its abraded area.|$|E
40|$|Iron and its products, {{especially}} {{the various forms}} of steel, have been and still are a vital material in many sectors of life. It is utilized in many industrial activities ranging from production of heavy duty mechanical equipment to light electrical appliances and home appliances. With the world‟s iron ore consumption estimated to stand at 1. 3 billion tonnes by 2025, exploitation of any existing natural deposits is of increasing importance {{to meet the demands of}} the expanding world economy. Large deposits of iron ore exist in Uganda in the eastern (Tororo) regions and south-western (Kisoro-Kabale) regions of the country. The ore deposits of Kisoro-Kabale consist of an iron-rich hematite grade with less deleterious impurities as compared to that of Tororo. Prospective quantification puts the deposits at 30 - 50 million tonnes of raw-ore reserves. To date the deposits lay unexploited, with small holder black smith activities taking place in the area. This work involves understanding the occurrence, quantity and quality of the ore plus its properties and characteristics in a bid to pave way for its exploitation for economic use in Uganda and beyond. Characterisation was done on the samples collected from the deposits, to establish its physical, chemical and metallurgical properties. Literature detailing the natural occurrence of the deposits plus the genesis of the parent rocks and ore and the prospective tonnage is included. The economic situation in Uganda as far as demand and consumption of iron and steel is concerned is also briefly highlighted. The chemical, physical and metallurgical characteristics that could facilitate the initial exploitation of the ore are examined with conclusive results from the representative samples examined. The results present Muko ore as a high grade of hematite with an Fe content averaging 68 %. The gangue content (SiO 2 +Al 2 O 3) of 5 of the 6 samples investigated is 85 wt%, an <b>Abrasion</b> <b>Index</b> value < 4 wt% and a Shatter Index value < 2. 5 wt%. This implies that the ore holds its form during the processes of mining, transportation, screening and descent when loaded in the furnace for reduction. Its reducibility index was found to be 0. 868 %/min. This is well within the desired reduction limits for the major iron reduction processes. It implies that a high productivity (in terms of iron reduced) can be realised in the reduction processes in a given period of time. Muko iron ore was found to meet most of the feed raw material requirements (physical, chemical and metallurgical) for the blast furnace and the major direct reduction processes (Midrex, HYL III and SL/RN). Furthermore, for those desired for sinter and pellet making. It can thus serve well as a feed raw material for smelting reduction and direct reduction processes.

40|$|The {{life cycle}} of commercially printed digital {{documents}} (in particular, marketing and promotional items, direct mailers, business communications, and on-demand color books) was examined to find stress points where potential permanence problems could exist. The stress and life cycle overview covers the stages of processes in printing and finishing, mailing preparation and fulfillment, distribution, usage, and recycling. Stress points found in the different stages of the life cycle, whether physical or chemical, include (but are not limited to) scratching, rubbing, cracking, solvent exposure, light exposure, moisture exposure, heat exposure, and air contamination exposure. Tests for abrasion resistance, folding resistance, solvent resistance, light-fastness, water-fastness, thermostability, and gas/ozone fastness were researched. Based on a survey given to randomly selected printers, printing press vendors, and print buyers, the tests for abrasion resistance, folding resistance, and rub resistance were selected. Using offset lithography as a benchmark, three commercial digital presses as well as high-speed ink jet technology were included in this testing. Using a combination of solid circular test targets and the “Three Musicians” test target (an image for visual comparisons), the Taber Abraser testing method, the Sutherland Rub testing method, and a folding procedure outlined in ASTM document F 1351 were used to examine and to compare the five presses in this study (three commercial digital presses, one offset lithographic press, and one high-speed ink jet press). After testing was performed, visual ranking, changes in density, Delta E, and the <b>abrasion</b> resistance <b>index</b> were used as the criteria to evaluate results. Testing {{results showed that the}} high-speed ink jet held up the best in each test performed during this research; however, the image quality of the high-speed ink jet press was less than the image quality of any other press in this study. The second best performer in the testing was the offset lithographic press. The test performance of these particular presses, as compared with the commercial digital presses, was attributed to the different drying methods in each of the different printing technologies. In the ink jet and lithographic presses, the evaporation, absorption, and oxidation drying methods seemed to hold up better to the testing performed than the drying method of toner-based technology. With oxidation and evaporation, the image (i. e., the ink) actually becomes a part of the paper after drying, whereas, in toner technology, the image (i. e., the toner) is fused to the paper and actually sits on top of it. Within the digital printing industry, coatings have been put in place to alleviate some of these problems, but they have not been tested here. This research shows that offset lithography is the dominant technology in terms of offering abrasion and folding resistance of its printed product...|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the parametric description of a selected size class of the gravel bedload, collected from a number of sample points, of the Tambo River in Eastern Victoria. Lithological composition of the samples is investigated and related to the lithological nature of the basin. Measurements of form, sphericity and roundness are made for samples of the two most abundant lithological types - rhyodacite and sandstone. Changes in mean values of these parameters between stations are related to operative processes, some of which can be characterized by the physical and lithological characteristics of the basin. kdetailed description is presented of the physical environment of the catchment. Consideration is given to sampling procedures and, the selection of suitable parameters to describe pebble morphometry. It can be shown that Wadell and Maximum Projection sphericity are partial expressions of form. R-mode factor analysis is used to compare the relative merits of four measures of roundness, on the basis of which the Kuenen and Kaiser measures. are used for further work. Subsequently the Kuenen roundness method is shown to be the most suitable {{for the purpose of this}} study. The quantitative relationships between the lithological nature of the basin and the composition of gravel samples are investigated using methods of analysis first introduced by Tricart in France in 1959 but apparently not previously applied in the English speaking world. The description of the mean form of a sample requires two parameters but values of chi-square can be used as a single parameter measuring the magnitude of change in form between two sampling stations. Changes in form, sphericity and roundness can be related to four basic processes: abrasion, shape sorting, dilution and breakage. In the case of form and sphericity it is shown that all four can be expressed in quantitative form. Changes in mean roundness of sandstone pebbles show a marked trend with respect to distance downstream, but no such tendency can be observed in the case of Thyodacite particles. Mean Kuenen roundness of samples can be replaced, with very little loss of information, by <b>abrasion</b> and breakage <b>indices</b> devised by the writer. Matrices of correlation coefficients are used to investigate relationships between variables both within and between samples and in the latter case also between the two dominant lithologies. They assist in reaching a better understanding of the nature of inter-relationships. Finally, a multiple correlation and regression model is employed to assess quantitatively the relative importance of different processes in producing change in form and sphericity between samples. In the case of rhyodacite highly significant multiple correlations are obtained and it is found that nearly all change can be explained in terms of processes and variations in mean sample size. In the case of sandstone the technique is less successful but even here changes in form at least have a significant multiple correlation with parameters representing processes and sample size...|$|R
