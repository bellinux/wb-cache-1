A simple strategy is developed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> to employ a uniform quantity-discount policy to coordinate buyers' replenishment times by the power-of-two policy.

It is shown that time coordination generally has a substantial benefit <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vendor,</b> although <b>the</b> benefit to the buyers may be limited. Furthermore, uniform quantity discounts to all buyers are normally feasible but not sufficient to achieve perfect channel coordination when buyers act independently. The proposed strategy obtains a high proportion of the maximum benefit under perfect channel coordination. Quantity Discounts, Channel Coordination, Supply Chain Management...|$|R

In this three-tier supply chain system, <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> purchases raw material produces into finished products, and delivers finished {{products to the}} retailers. We assume that the production (at <b>the</b> <b>vendor)</b> and <b>the</b> replenishment (at all the retailers) of the finished products share the common cycle time (T), but the replenishment cycle of raw material <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> is an integer multiple of T. The focus {{of this study is}} to solve the optimal common cycle to minimize the average joint total costs (AJTC) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> in <b>the</b> whole supply chain system. To solve this problem, we derive <b>the</b> expression <b>for</b> <b>the</b> AJTC, and analyze the theoretical properties of the optimal AJTC curve. We show that the optimal AJTC curve is piece-wise convex with respect to T, and the junction points on the optimal AJTC curve can be easily located by a closed-form formula. By utilizing our theoretical properties, we propose an efficient search algorithm for solving this problem. Our random experiments demonstrate that our search algorithm effectively obtains the optimal solution, and interestingly, <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> could gain more cost saving when more retailers join the three-tier supply chain system...|$|R
