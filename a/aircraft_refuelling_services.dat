The problem which arises {{is to determine the}} minimum number of refuelling trucks and their routes for the given demand (schedule and fuel quantities). The constraint {{is that there is no}} aircraft departure delay due to the refuelling process. The optimum solution is found here using the branch-and-bound technique. This solution is compared with results obtained on the basis of random assignment and a few conclusions are made. The paper also presents a model application example based on real life data from a medium-sized airport. ...|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "Scottish" [...] {{has been}} {{completely}} based at Fort William since the 1977 event and is so popular that there are usually over 500 entries for the 275 places available. Of the 275 places, 30 are reserved for factory teams and a further 50 for allocation by the Club. The remaining places are allocated through a ballot system. Following a period of private <b>refuelling</b> <b>services</b> {{and the increase in}} health and safety regulations, the British Army were invited and made use of the SSDT as a live refuelling exercise called 'Operation Highland Trot'. The future of the SSDT was put into temporary jeopardy in 2003 when the Army reluctantly announced in late 2002 that they were no longer able to provide a <b>refuelling</b> <b>service.</b> However, the SSDT was able to continue through 2003 with another branch of the Army taking over the <b>refuelling</b> <b>services.</b> Since the 1960s it has been customary for a Scotsman to be allocated the riding number 1. The trial celebrated its 'Official Centenary' in 2011, 100 years since the 1911 event, which was the first organised by the Edinburgh & District Motor Club Ltd. The majority of the event takes place on private ground, connected by public highway. Following the event by motorcycle on private land is strictly prohibited, as permission for the competitors and officials is only granted under this caveat. Spectators at observed sections are welcome, but those spectating are asked to park sensibly at or near sections. Observing these requirements will thus ensure the future of this prestigious event. The trial organisers work very closely with landowners and government agencies to ensure that the environment is protected during not only the event itself, but the preparations prior to it on an annual basis.|$|R
50|$|These {{switches}} {{are usually}} {{used as a}} form of fail-safe where they stop a machine with no operator from potentially dangerous action or incapacitate a device as a result of accident, malfunction, or misuse. They are common in such applications in locomotives, <b>aircraft</b> <b>refuelling,</b> freight elevators, lawn mowers, tractors, personal watercraft, outboard motors, chainsaws, snowblowers, tread machines, snowmobiles, amusement rides, and many medical imaging devices. On some machines, these switches merely bring the machines back to a safe state, such as reducing the throttle to idle or applying brakes while leaving the machines still running and ready to resume normal operation once control is reestablished.|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} interest {{over the last}} decade in developing unmanned aerial systems' technologies has prompted research into methods for automating air to air refuelling processes. Furthermore, for systems with increased autonomy the necessary logic and flight control systems to perform autonomous air to air refuelling is now being pursued. There has already been significant research in position tracking, rendezvous scheduling, apparatus modelling, wake effects, and vision-based sensors to support refuelling of unmanned systems and to increase the autonomy in manned <b>aircraft</b> <b>refuelling.</b> Many of these build upon considerable research and understanding that has matured for manned air to air refuelling.

Heavy rain washed other bridges away and by 18 June the stranded Austrian forces on the Allied bank of the river were routed by a counterattack.|$|R
50|$|Basic groundcrewman {{aircraft}} support training {{consists of}} three individual courses, totalling approximately 19 weeks. The first course conducted is a basic drivers course where soldiers gain qualifications in operating the Army Landrover 110 and Unimog truck.

The next course to be completed is the two-week bulk fuel tanker course held at the Army Logistic Training Centre at Bandiana in Victoria. This course involves instruction in operating bulk and portable refuelling equipment and fuel quality control. The final course, and longest in duration at 9 to 12 weeks is the forward arming and refuelling course, held at the Oakey Army Aviation Centre in Queensland. Here soldiers are taught <b>aircraft</b> <b>refuelling</b> and arming operation both in the barracks and field environment.|$|R

50|$|The {{airfield}} has two grass runways, both {{of which}} operate with a displaced threshold to allow aircraft to sufficiently clear the Bruce Highway and local roads. The primary strip is 12/30 which has an available landing distance measuring 1210 m. A short sealed area exists at the runway 12 threshold stretching approximately 250m. A secondary strip aligned 06/24 has an available distance of 821 m for landings. Use of runway 24 is generally discouraged due to the proximity of Caboolture Hospital on this heading. <b>Aircraft</b> <b>refuelling</b> is available.

25|$|No. 32 Squadron's first mission {{took place}} {{the day it}} was formed, when {{aircraft}} were launched to search for a reported enemy submarine. A few days later, the squadron undertook the first of many bombing raids on the Japanese air base at Gasmata. After only a few weeks of operations, due to enemy raids on Port Moresby's Seven Mile airfield, the squadron was withdrawn to Horn Island, Queensland, but continued to stage out of Seven Mile on its missions, its <b>aircraft</b> <b>refuelling</b> there en route to their targets. In March 1942, one of the squadron's Hudsons was the first to spot the Japanese convoy transporting the forces for the invasion of the New Guinea mainland. Later the same month, the squadron engaged Japanese forces landing at Lae and Salamaua. In July 1942, No. 32 Squadron was active in the Gona area and during the lead-up to the Battle of Milne Bay.|$|R
