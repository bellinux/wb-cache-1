40|$|Abstract: Ruminant {{animals have}} a great {{advantage}} over simple-stomached animals, as their digestive process is able to release the energy contained in cellulosic material through carbohydrate fermentation by microorganisms enzymes from the rumen environment. However, carbohydrate fermentation results not only in short chain fatty acids (SCFA) but also in less desirable products such as heat, as well as methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) gases which represents energy loss for the animal estimated in 2 to 12 % of gross energy from feed (Johnson and Johnson, 1995). As an <b>adult</b> <b>ruminant</b> can produce up to 17 liters of methane per hour and this gas cannot be metabolized even by rumen microorganisms, {{most of it is}} removed from rumen by expiration or eructation (Moss, 1993), and released in the environment. There are different techniques for methane emissions measurements by ruminants in production conditions; among them there is one that uses an inert gas tracer, sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6). This technique results in a precise estimative of methane production by the animal besides enabling the evaluation of animals in normal pasture conditions, it consists in placing a permeation tube, which releases SF 6 at a previously known rate in the rumen, where by the contractions of this organ, CH 4 and SF 6 gases are released by eructation and samples are collected close to mouth and nostrils. This method assumes that the standard of SF 6 emission simulates the standard of CH 4 emission. The flow of CH 4 released by the animal is calculated in relation to SF 6 flow (Westberg et al., 1998). The objective with {{the present study was to}} evaluate energy sources inclusion in cattle diets on methane production determined by sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) tracer gas technique. 201...|$|R

In order to assess the probability of BTV overwintering by persistence in <b>adult</b> vectors, <b>ruminants</b> (through prolonged viraemia) {{or a combination of}} both, a quantitative risk assessment model was developed. Furthermore, the model allowed the role played by the residual number of vectors present during winter to be examined, and the effect of a proportion of Culicoides living inside buildings (endophilic behaviour) to be explored. The model was then applied to a real scenario: overwintering in Germany between 2006 and 2007. The results showed that the limited number of vectors active during winter seemed to allow the transmission of BTV during this period, and that while transmission was favoured by the endophilic behaviour of some Culicoides, its effect was limited. Even though transmission was possible, the likelihood of BTV overwintering by the mechanisms studied seemed too low to explain the observed re-emergence of the disease. Therefore, other overwintering mechanisms not considered in the model are likely to have {{played a significant role in}} BTV overwintering in Germany between 2006 and 2007. </p...|$|R

The main findings of these studies have a) PhysicaI development of the forestomachs: In grazing lefts the four stomachs have reached their adult proportions by approximately 8 weeks of age. The type of diet can markedly influence the rate of growth of the forestomachs, and in general, it would appear that plant food is needed for the normal development of the forestomachs, and It plant food is excluded from the diet the development of the forestomachs is retarded at about the level found in the 3 week old grazing lamb. The main changes in the histology of the forestomach walls takes place during the last third of foetal life, and the adult his histological features are all present at birth. The major post-natal histological changes are complete by 56 days of age. It would appear that age is the main factor controlling the histological development of the forestomachs, and that plant material is necessary for the full development It of these organs. It was also shown that different diets can cause differences in the appearance of the rumen mucosal surface, stratum granulosum and stratum corneum. b) Funcational development of the reticulo-rumen: It was postulated that the functional development of the reticulo-rumen of the grazing iamb could be divided into three phases - a non ruminant phase (0 - 3 weeks of age), a transition phase (3 - 8 weeks of age) and an <b>adult</b> <b>ruminant</b> phase (8 weeks of age onwards). If plant food was excluded from the diet, the lamb remained in the non- ruminant phase, however, once plant food was fed to these lambs the reticule-rumen function reached the adult levels within one week. c) Field studies: As the forestomachs of the grazing are qualitatively and quantitatively fully developed by approximately 8 weeks of age, it is possible to ween lambs of this age with no check to their growth rate, provided the pastures are relatively high in protein and are not at the late flowering or seeding stages. The milk yield of the grazing ewe measured by the oxytocin technique gave consistently higher recordings throughout Iactation than the conventional lamb suckling technique. By the tenth week of the lactation the milk yield, as measured by both techniques, had fallen by half. There was a high correlation between the milk yield of the ewe and the lamb live weight growth up to seven weeks of age. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Intensive {{livestock}} production and management systems {{are associated with}} increased faecal-oral pathogen transmission which can contribute to a high prevalence of multiple Salmonella serovars in large dairy farms and feedlots. Outbreaks of salmonellosis in livestock often reflect {{a series of events}} that compromise host immunity and increase pathogen exposure. High risk groups in cattle include neonates and post partum cows (Anderson, et al., 2001; House, et al., 2001 a; Fossler, et al., 2005 a) and variation in susceptibility to salmonella infection has been observed in sheep entering feedlots according to property of origin, body condition, and time of year (Norris, et al., 1989 a; Norris, et al., 1989 b; Richards and Hyder, 1991; Kelly, 1995; Makin, 2011). The associated increase in the incidence of disease and contamination of livestock-derived food products imposes a significant risk to food safety via consumption of contaminated meat, milk, eggs and vegetables. The development and application of effective Salmonella vaccines offers a potential means of reducing industry associated losses and public health risks. Effective Salmonella vaccination therefore requires induction of protection against several Salmonella serovars and stimulation of both innate and acquired immune mechanisms. Vaccine prophylaxis is normally achieved through vaccinating animals several weeks prior to virulent pathogen exposure. This is not possible in neonates where exposure occurs at birth and in feedlots where livestock are sourced from diverse locations and vendors. Additionally, direct physical handling of livestock to administer vaccines contributes to stress and may lead to carcass damage. Conducting stressful procedures at feedlot induction when there is concurrent exposure to a diversity of pathogens contributes to an increased risk of disease. iii Traditional vaccination methods are labour intensive and associated with carcass damage and adverse reactions. Oral delivery of vaccines and medications via drinking water is a common practice in intensively managed poultry. Oral vaccine delivery via drinking water avoids the stress of additional handling and provides a means of rapidly vaccinating large numbers of animals. The efficacy of Salmonella vaccination is largely influenced by the diversity of Salmonella serovars encountered and the interval between immunisation and pathogen exposure, which may be short in field settings, e. g., following birth, during transport and following introduction into feedlots. The timing of virulent pathogen exposure may also {{have an impact on the}} safety of a Salmonella vaccine. It is imperative to develop livestock vaccines that are capable of safely eliciting potent states of cross-protective immunity against a diversity of serovars. This thesis examines the capacity of the dam S. Typhimurium vaccine (serogroup B) to elicit cross-protection against a virulent challenge in models of neonate and <b>adult</b> <b>ruminant</b> models of salmonellosis, as well as investigating in-water vaccine delivery. Cross-protective efficacy of the vaccine was evaluated against an emerging, clinically relevant, and multi-drug resistant strain of serovar Newport (serogroup C 2 -C 3) that had been associated with clinical disease in calves and humans (CDC, 2002; Clark, 2004). Vaccinated calves challenged with S. Newport exhibited a significant attenuation of clinical disease and a concomitant reduction in S. Newport faecal shedding and colonisation of mesenteric lymph nodes and lungs compared to non-vaccinated control animals. The safety and efficacy of a S. Typhimurium dam vaccine in adult sheep was demonstrated via novel oral delivery in drinking water (ad libitum). The capacity of S. Typhimurium dam vaccine to be delivered in drinking water to protect livestock from virulent Salmonella challenge offers an effective, economical, stressor free Salmonella prophylaxis for intensive {{livestock production}} systems...|$|R
40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} between November 2011 and March 2012 to determine the prevalence of mange mites and to identify the major mite species affecting small ruminants in Haramaya wereda (district), East Harerghe zone, Eastern Ethiopia. A total of 810 animals from both species (384 sheep and 421 goats) were sampled using the formula of [1]. The study showed that the prevalence of mange mite in sheep and goats was 3. 34 % and 5. 94 %, respectively. From 197 and 613, young and <b>adult</b> small <b>ruminants</b> examined for mange mites the recorded prevalence rate was 6. 09 % and 4. 61 %, respectively whereas among 373 and 437, male and female small ruminants examined for mange mites the prevalence rate of 4. 02 and 5. 26 % was recorded, respectively. The prevalence rate recorded in lowland and midland was 4. 22 % and 2. 77 %, respectively. No statistically significant association was observed between the prevalence rate and different species, age and sex of the animals (p> 0. 05). However, there was statistically significant association between the prevalence rate of mange infestation and agro-ecological zones (p< 0. 05). The major species of mites identified were sarcoptes spp, psoroptes spp and demodex spp in goat and only psoroptes spp in sheep. From the mange mite species-affecting goats, sarcoptes scabies was the most prevalent species observed on 4. 28 % of the goats followed by psoroptes ovis (0. 95 %) and demodex caprae (0. 71 %). In sheep, the prevalence of the only identified species, psoroptes ovis was 3. 34 %. Further studies {{should be done to}} evaluate risk factors and the seasonal occurrence of mange in small ruminants in the area to devise effective control measure...|$|R
