40|$|The European Journal of Immunology publishes papers {{focusing}} on {{various aspects of}} immunological research: antigen processing, cellular immune response, immunity to infection, immunomodulation, innate immunity, molecular immunology, leukocyte signalling, clinical immunology, and new technology. Purely descriptive studies detailing changes in gene expression profiles without any further significant investigation into the mechanisms/ mechanistic consequences of the altered expression, even if technically challenging/well performed, are not considered by the European Journal of Immunology for publication. This policy builds on that established by the Journal for studies into peptides, T cell recognition and amino acid sequences of gene products that are not novel but only allelic variations and {{that have not been}} linked to substantial progress in analytical insight. Again, such studies are not considered for publication. Accepted Articles are unedited, preprint manuscripts that are published online a few days after final <b>acceptance.</b> <b>Accepted</b> Articles are citable and included in PubMed. Early View articles are copy-edited, typeset articles that are published in advance of issue compilation and printing. Early View articles are typically available one month after acceptance. Authors are requested to follow these instructions carefully. Manuscripts that are not in accordance with these instructions will be returned to authors and this will inevitably lead to a delay in the editorial processing of the manuscript.

This paper proves that it is decidable whether a deterministic pushdown automaton (dpda) accepts a simple language. For this purpose, we prove that it is decidable whether a real-time dpda with empty stack <b>acceptance</b> <b>accepts</b> a simple language. To prove this, we present two conditions called nonsingularity and separability conditions and show that for a real-time dpda M with empty stack acceptance, (i) the language accepted by M is simple if and only if M satisfies the two conditions, and (ii) it is decidable whether M satisfies the two conditions...|$|R

5000|$|In their 2008 {{interview}} with Rock, Paper, Shotgun, {{the writers of}} Dreamfall, Ragnar Tørnquist and Dag Scheve, have repeatedly stressed that faith was the central theme of the game's narrative and outlined a [...] "journey of faith" [...] model that guided the story arcs of every major character (Zoë, April, Kian, and Faith). In this model, every character starts {{in the state of}} having faith (which Tørnquist described as [...] "optimism... Or at least <b>acceptance.</b> <b>Accepting</b> how things are and being able to live with that"), e.g. in oneself, in one's abilities or purpose, in love, in God, etc. Upon encountering a challenge, individuals can briefly lose faith, but usually quickly rediscover it. If they keep losing faith, however, they descend further into disillusionment, then hopelessness, and ultimately a spiritual death. At this point, the character must undergo a profound internal transformation or suffer the physical death. According to the writers, Dreamfall advocates for having faith and for improving oneself by continuously rediscovering it in the face of adversity.|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} the strategies to overcome type 1 diabetes-related stigma {{at the individual}} level in Iran. This paper is part of the findings of an action research study, which was designed in Iran in 2012 to plan and implement a program for overcoming diabetes-related stigma. Participants were 44 people with type 1 diabetes. Unstructured in-depth interviews, focus groups, email, short message service (SMS) and telephone interview was used to extract strategies to overcome the diabetes-related stigma. Due to the qualitative nature of the data in this phase of the action research, data were analyzed using inductive content analysis approach. Findings showed that in the viewpoint of people with diabetes, their behaviors and reactions are important factors in their resistance to diabetes-related stigma, reducing social stigma, and avoiding its harmful effects. They referred to the interconnected strategies as disease <b>acceptance,</b> <b>accepting</b> social stigma, reinforcing spirituality, enhancing self-esteem and self-confidence, effective self-care activities, and forming real and distant groups. Individual interventions are important steps to initiate overcoming diabetes-related stigma, and social activities will not be successful without them. They are much more economical and more practical than social level measures. These findings can help healthcare teams to integrate anti-stigma strategies in their routine care plan to reduce stigma as well as providing diabetes management...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate how parents of disabled people deal with the phenomenon of disability, their hardships in accepting the process, and support mechanisms used to deal with the situation. The phenomenological research design was used and 17 in-depth interviews were conducted with parents. Of the interviewed parents’ children, five of them have mental retardation, five have a physical disability, five have both a mental and physical disability, and two have autism spectrum disorder. The obtained data were phenomenologically analyzed with the support of MAXQDA 11. Data were examined in three general categories: difficulty of the process, coping resources, and spiritual coping. Of these categories, difficulty of the process and coping resources are thought to allow for better understanding of spiritual coping, the focus of the study. The sub-themes of shock/collapse, not attributing, fear of losing the child, disappointment, self-blame, loneliness, lack of paternal support, negative environmental effects, concern for the future, and despair is evaluated under the theme of difficulty of the process. The sub-themes of expert support, family support, environmental care, rationalizing, hope, following daily routines, blaming, and unable to be apart from the child is evaluated under the theme of coping resources. The core category of the research, spiritual coping resources, is examined under the categories of <b>acceptance</b> (<b>accepting</b> what comes from God and destiny), giving spiritual meaning (being tested, repentance, fear of God, and being an entrustment from God), and trust in God (resignation, gratitude, and prayer).

40|$|H-dibaryon {{has been}} {{predicted}} as a stable 6 -quark color-singlet state. It has been searched for by many experiments but {{has never been}} discovered. Recent lattice QCD calculations predict H-dibaryon as a weakly bound or a resonant state close to the LL threshold. E 224 and E 522 experiments at KEK observed peaks in LL invariant mass spectra near the threshold in (K-, K+) reactions, which were statistically not significant. Therefore, we proposed a new experiment E 42 at J-PARC. It will measure decay products of ΛΛ and Λπ-p in a (K-, K+) reaction. We design a large acceptance spectrometer based on a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) immersed in a dipole magnetic field. The TPC surrounds a target to cover nearly 4 π <b>acceptance,</b> and <b>accepts</b> K- beams up to 106 counts per second.

40|$|Change effort {{estimation}} {{and change}} impact analysis are two important methods for realizing {{the consequences of}} requested changes and make effective change <b>acceptance</b> decisions. <b>Accepting</b> too many changes in the software development phase causes additional cost and delay in the completion. On the other hand, rejection of the changes may cause customer dissatisfaction. There are very few works have been done to support effective change decisions in the software development phase compared to the software maintenance phase. The challenge of estimating the change effort in the software development phase is the existence of partially developed artifacts. In this report, we reviewed two selected current techniques; change impact analysis for the software development phase; and the well-known effort estimation model (COCOMO II). Afterwards, we introduced our new change effort estimation model for the software development phase which we name as COCHCOMO (Constructive Change Cost Model). It is developed to estimate change effort using impact analysis and initial COCOMO II estimated effort. Additionally, a prototype tool is developed to support our new model. The implementation of our model {{has been used to}} evaluate the accuracy of the model. The initial evaluation results on four case studies showed that this model is accurate...|$|R

An {{iterative}} selection hyper-heuristic {{passes a}} solution through a heuristic selection process {{to decide on}} a heuristic to apply from a fixed set of low level heuristics and then a move <b>acceptance</b> process to <b>accept</b> or reject the newly created solution at each step. In this study, we introduce Robinhood hyper-heuristic whose heuristic selection component allocates equal share from the overall execution time for each low level heuristic, while the move acceptance component enables partial restarts when the search process stagnates. The proposed hyper-heuristic is implemented as an extension to a public software used for benchmarking of hyper-heuristics, namely HyFlex. The empirical results indicate that Robinhood hyper-heuristic is a simple, yet powerful and general multistage algorithm performing better {{than most of the}} previously proposed selection hyper-heuristics across six different Hyflex problem domains. ...|$|R
