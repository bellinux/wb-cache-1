The Millennium Tower's, which were completed in 2008, are currently sinking. This has an extremely {{negative impact on the}} residents of this building, who have spent millions of dollars to live in this building. In response to this engineering travesty, San Francisco's city attorney has decided to file a lawsuit against the developer because the developer failed to inform the residents of the <b>accelerated</b> <b>speed</b> that the building was sinking at. If this lawsuit results in success for San Francisco this could lead to policy changes being made in the future surrounding transparency between developers and potential buyers of the developed land.|$|E
2500|$|From January to March 2009, turbine2 was {{undergoing}} scheduled repairs and modernization. It {{was the first}} and only turbine in the station which was equipped with a new electro-hydraulic regulator of its rotational speed supplied by the Promavtomatika company. [...] During the course of the repair, the turbine blades were welded, because after a long period of operation, cracks and cavities had once again appeared. The turbine runner was not properly rebalanced after these repairs, following which turbine2 had increased vibrations, ca [...] for the main bearing during the full load of the turbine. While this did not exceed specifications, the increased vibrations were unacceptable for long term use. The elevated vibration levels compared to other turbines were apparent for turbine 2 before the repair as well. The vibrations exceeded the allowed specification in the beginning of July and continued to increase with <b>accelerated</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E

60|$|The Frenchman was, {{when the}} Agile {{delivered}} her last broadside, running nearly before the wind, {{and it was}} speedily evident that the injury to her rudder had been fatal, for although she attempted by trimming her sails again to bear up, each time she fell off, though not before some of her shot had hulled her active opponent. Seeing, however, that he must now be easily outmanoeuvred, the Frenchman made no further effort to change his course, but continued doggedly on his way, the topmen swarming aloft and shaking out more canvas. The Agile followed the frigate's example, and placing herself on her stern quarter, kept up a steady fire, yawing when necessary to bring all her guns to bear, the French replying occasionally with one of their stern guns. Owing to the <b>accelerated</b> <b>speed</b> at which both vessels were now going, the Indiamen had been left behind. Half an hour later the frigate's mizzen-mast, which had been severely wounded by the first broadside, went over her side. Cheer after cheer rose from the Agile; her opponent was now at her mercy. She had but to repeat the tactics with which she had begun the fight. Just as Nat gave the order to do so, musket shots were heard in the distance. The crew {{of one of the}} merchantmen had been allowed to remain on deck, as, being under the guns of the frigate, there was no possibility of their attempting to overpower their captors. As soon, however, as it became evident that the frigate was getting the worst of it, they had been hurried below, and the hatches dropped over them. From the port-holes, however, they could obtain a view {{of what was going on}} ahead of them, and as soon as they saw the frigate's mast go by the board, they armed themselves with anything that would serve as weapons, managed to push up the after-hatch, and rushed on deck. The prize crew were all clustered forward watching the fight; a shout from the helmsman apprised them of their danger, and they rushed aft. They were, however, less numerous than the British sailors, and no better armed, for, believing that the frigate would easily crush her tiny assailant, they were unprepared to take any part in the fight.|$|E

40|$|The {{complexity}} {{of business and}} {{complexity of}} skills slow down {{the speed with which}} employees comes up to desired proficiency in the skills required to do their job. However, the pace of the business and the cut-throat competition does not allow organizations enough time waiting employees to acquire proficiency in required job skills Time-toproficiency is now becoming a crucial survival metrics for the business to accelerate customer satisfaction and profits. This business challenge requires organizations to rethink the training and learning strategies to bring employees up to speed. It appears that traditional training and learning interventions do not address the need for speed to proficiency. Extensive literature review indicates a lack of systematic research in this business-critical topic, especially on availability of any proven framework or model to design and deliver training interventions to <b>accelerate</b> <b>speed</b> to proficiency. To address this gap, as part of the doctorate research, the author has explored the training and learning strategies that have been implemented successfully by leading organizations to shorten the time-to-proficiency and <b>accelerate</b> <b>speed</b> to proficiency at the workplace. Author conducted a qualitative research across 42 industries through in-depth interviews with over 86 leading experts from renowned organizations who are known to have reduced the time-to-proficiency of employees. Using thematic analysis, a conceptual model is developed for various training and learning strategies to <b>accelerate</b> <b>speed</b> to proficiency. Preliminary data analysis revealed several workplace training, classroom training and e-learning strategies to reduce time-to-proficiency. However, the intent {{of this paper is to}} present a sub-set of the overall preliminary findings of this large research study. The focus of this paper is to report only the e-learning strategies found in the main study that hold strong potential to reduce time-to-proficiency...|$|R

50|$|The {{protagonist of}} the book is Lanik Mueller, heir {{apparent}} to the Mueller family kingdom. The Muellers, through generations of eugenics, have the ability to heal at an <b>accelerated</b> <b>speed</b> and regrow body parts naturally. The dark side to the Mueller nation is that, in order to obtain iron and other metals, they trade organs and body parts, which are harvested from radical regeneratives ("rads"). Radical regeneratives are people whose bodies can't distinguish between health and injury, and so grow extra appendages as well as organs of the opposite sex; although this is a normal phase for most Muellers at the age of puberty, the bodies of radical regeneratives never outgrow it.|$|E
