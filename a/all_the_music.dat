5|$|Herrmann {{used the}} lowered music budget to his {{advantage}} by writing for a string orchestra rather than a full symphonic ensemble, contrary to Hitchcock's request for a jazz score. He thought of the single tone color of the all-string soundtrack {{as a way of}} reflecting the black-and-white cinematography of the film. The strings play con sordini (muted) for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> other than the shower scene, creating a darker and more intense effect. Film composer Fred Steiner, in an analysis of the score to Psycho, points out that string instruments gave Herrmann access to a wider range in tone, dynamics, and instrumental special effects than any other single instrumental group would have.|$|E
