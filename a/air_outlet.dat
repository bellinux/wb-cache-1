5|$|T-26 model 1931: twin-turreted version {{armed with}} two DT tank machine guns. The first {{series-produced}} {{variant of the}} T-26 that was equipped with turrets differing from the initial Vickers design (Soviet turrets were higher and had an observation window). Tanks produced from 1931 to March 1932 had a riveted hull and turrets, a silencer affixed with two clamps, and lacked any cover over the <b>air</b> <b>outlet</b> window. About 1,177 T-26 mod. 1931 tanks armed with machine guns were accepted by the Red Army, which had 1,015 such twin-turreted tanks on 1 April 1933.|$|E
5|$|Hulls of twin-turreted T-26s were {{assembled}} using armoured plates {{riveted to}} a frame from metal angles. Some tanks, produced in 1931, had sealing zinc shims at the hull bottom between armoured plates for fording water obstacles. After problems with rain entering the engine compartment, a special cover was installed over an <b>air</b> <b>outlet</b> window after March 1932. Some T-26s produced {{at the end}} of 1932–1933 had a riveted and welded hull. The T-26 mod. 1931 had two cylindrical turrets mounted on ball bearings; each turret turned independently through 240°. Both turrets could provide common fire in front and rear arcs of fire (100° each). The disadvantage of such a configuration was that not all of the tank's firepower could be used at once on the same side. Four turret modifications existed, and they were mounted on tanks in different combinations (for instance, a tank with a riveted hull could have riveted and welded turrets).|$|E
25|$|The K200 {{series of}} {{vehicles}} transport mechanized infantry platoon {{is designed to}} keep personnel safe from small arms fire. The hull of the KIFV is of all-welded aluminium armour with an additional layer of spaced laminate steel armour bolted to it. This composite armour provides {{a higher level of}} protection for less weight. It can protect against 12.7mm on the side and 7.62mm on the rear, and against anti-personnel mines. The engine compartment is located at the front right of the vehicle and is separated from the remainder of the vehicle by a bulkhead. The engine compartment is fitted with a fire extinguishing system that can be operated by the driver or from outside the vehicle. The air inlet, <b>air</b> <b>outlet</b> louvres and the exhaust pipe are located {{on the roof of the}} vehicle to allow amphibious operations.|$|E

40|$|In {{particular}} the thermal comfort of passengers {{is the essential}} design objective in the cabin air ventilation layout for modern civil passenger aircraft. Solar radiation, electrical equipment, on-board electronics, high power converters, in-flight entertainment and communication devices and most important the heat release of the passengers are representing thermal loads. This heat loads have to be balanced by cold air coming from the air vents of cabin <b>air</b> <b>outlets</b> of the <b>air</b> ventilation system. In fact, the temperature distribution inside the passenger cabin can only be controlled by the air conditioning system. Besides providing the passengers with the fresh, an essential task is to avoid discomfort for the passengers by ensuring a good mixing of fresh with aged air and by guaranteeing a high air flow exchange rate for each individual passenger {{according to the requirements}} defined in. Cabin <b>air</b> <b>outlets</b> are a crucial device for the air flow distribution within the cabin. Although a high air exchange rate is necessary for thermal comfort the incoming fresh air must not exceed a certain flow velocity in order to avoid gust. Therefore, the air should be evenly distributed by an outlet device, i. e. a plenum, an orifice plate or flow straighteners, before it can leave the outlets through the vents forming a homogeneous planar air jet. This optimal precondition facilitates a successive control of the air distribution within the aircraft cabin. In particular, in the early design phase of aircraft cabin layouts numerical flow simulations are undertaken presuming that this precondition is fulfilled. In fact this is not always the case; hence, design work has to be done to improve cabin <b>air</b> <b>outlets.</b> Unfortunately, the space envelope for cabin <b>air</b> <b>outlets</b> is quite limited by stringers, insulation, ducting, wires, cables or lining elements. Not only the outer space envelope is a major constraint when designing <b>air</b> <b>outlets,</b> moreover, internal drag and weight {{have a negative impact on}} the power consumption of the Environmental Control System (ECS) and, therefore, on the fuel consumption of the aircraft. Both have to be minimized in order to save power and costs. Not at all, the optimization of cabin <b>air</b> <b>outlets</b> is a major task in the design process of the air ventilation system, in particular when bearing in mind that future cabin interior will be modularly designed and especially customized in order to meet corporate design constraints of the airliners...|$|R

These included the re-stressed and strengthened fuselage structure and the new windscreen design, which was also used on some Vb Spitfires. The Vc also introduced the Type C or [...] "Universal" [...] wing along with the revised main undercarriage; the tops of these wings featured large, bulged fairings to provide clearance for the ammunition feed motors of two Hispano cannon. Later, because two cannon were seldom fitted, these fairings were later reduced in size to more streamlined shapes. A deeper radiator fairing was fitted under the starboard wing and a larger oil cooler [...] with a deeper, kinked <b>air</b> <b>outlet</b> was fitted underneath the port wing. In addition more armour plating was added, protecting the bottom of the pilot's seat and the wing ammunition boxes.|$|E
