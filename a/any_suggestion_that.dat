5|$|Bamber {{visited the}} farm {{on the evening}} of Tuesday, 6 August. He told the court that his parents {{suggested}} to Sheila that evening that the boys be placed in day-time foster care with a local family. Bamber said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply said she would rather stay in London. The boys had been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Ferguson, told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> the children be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but that she might have welcomed daytime help.|$|E
25|$|At Bernal's {{memorial}} service, Zuckerman downplayed Bernal's {{part in the}} Normandy landings, {{saying he}} was not cleared for {{the highest levels of}} security. Given Bernal's Marxist and pro-Soviet sympathies it is perhaps remarkable that there has never been <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> he fed any information in that direction. But Brown provides evidence of Bernal's contributions to the preparation and the success of the invasion.|$|E
25|$|On 4 April reports emerged, later {{confirmed}} by US Defense Secretary Robert Gates, that an Iranian representative {{will meet the}} five Iranian government employees captured in January in a US raid on an Iranian liaison office in Arbil, although {{this would not be}} an official consular visit.

Subsequently the Courier-Mail published a full apology {{in which it}} accepted the truth of Daubney's denial, and expressed its regret and apology for <b>any</b> <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> Daubney's denial was anything less than accurate and truthful.|$|R
25|$|Despite (or {{perhaps because}} of) {{the fact that}} Wonder Woman {{had fallen in love}} with the first Steve Trevor, the {{producers}} chose to drop <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> Steve Jr. and Wonder Woman were anything more than good friends. Indeed, when an impostor posing as Steve Jr. attempted to seduce Diana, she made it quite clear that she had no sexual interest in him. Executive producer Douglas S. Cramer noted the difficulties in maintaining long-term romantic tension between leads, because the resolution of that romantic tension often results in the cancellation of the series.|$|E
25|$|The Asian {{side was}} {{selected}} from players from Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. With {{the exception of}} Bangladesh (whose selector had previously only played in the ICC Trophy), each country had one ex-Test cricketer as a selector: Majid Khan (Pakistan), Ravi Shastri (India), Graeme Labrooy (Sri Lanka) and Shafiq Ul-Haque (Bangladesh). There was controversy surrounding the omission of Indian captain Sourav Ganguly from the Asian side, leading to Ganguly criticising the selection panel and process; although {{there were reports that}} the selection panel decided unanimously against including Ganguly, and that <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> he should have been included would have led to Majid Khan and Ravi Shastri walking out.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Flying Corps were {{involved}} in the First World War as part of the Army. Following the establishment of the Royal Air Force in 1918, Australia's Minister for Defence, Senator George Foster Pearce, appointed the Swinburne Committee to report on the needs of military aviation. Australia's involvement in the Imperial defence strategy inevitably placed its senior military commanders in a position subordinate to their British counterparts, and as its starting point the Committee accepted the strategy's basis that Australia's security would continue to be based on sea power. The committee found that while they supported the establishment of an air service, they rejected <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> it should have an independent role. Any Australian air force would exist solely to support the sea and land forces.|$|E
50|$|Prime Minister Stephen Harper {{rejected}} <b>any</b> <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> {{the federal}} government is not doing enough. The Conservative government's changes are the subject of heated controversy as academics and the opposition express concerns over the few details that have emerged so far. The 2008 budget indicated the CFIA was asked to find savings to pay for new programs. The leaked document indicated savings would be found by transferring some meat-inspection duties to industry.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was also}} claimed that Business Secretary, Peter Mandelson, {{had met with}} Saif Gaddafi {{on at least two}} {{occasions}} at which a possible release had been discussed. Mandelson confirmed this, but said that he had told Gaddafi that any release was entirely a matter for the Scottish Justice Secretary. He went on to describe as [...] "offensive" [...] <b>any</b> <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> a release had been linked to a trade deal with Libya.|$|R

Valcke subsequently issued a statement denying <b>any</b> <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> pay off took place, and claimed that [...] "the country had used its financial muscle to lobby for support" [...] instead. Qatar officials similarly denied all media-perpetuated mischief allegations.|$|R

500|$|On 30 May 2004, US District judge Nancy Gertner {{ruled out}} the lawsuit {{explaining}} that stating someone is homosexual does not libel or slander them, {{particularly in light of}} new court decisions granting gays more rights. Gertner first rejected the idea that the mistake in captioning constituted a statement that Albright was gay. She added: [...] "Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly give them effect. In this day and age, recent rulings by the Supreme Court and the Supreme Judiciary Court of Massachusetts undermine <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> a statement implying that an individual is homosexual is defamatory.|$|E
500|$|The Church of Scientology {{describes}} Hubbard in hagiographic terms, and he portrayed {{himself as}} a pioneering explorer, world traveler, and nuclear physicist with expertise {{in a wide range}} of disciplines, including photography, art, poetry, and philosophy. In Scientology publications, he is referred to as [...] "Founder" [...] and [...] "Source" [...] of Scientology and Dianetics. His critics, including his own son Ronald DeWolf, have characterized him as a liar, a charlatan, and mentally unstable, though DeWolf later recanted those statements. Though many of Hubbard's autobiographical statements have been found to be fictitious, the Church rejects <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> its account of Hubbard's life is not historical fact.|$|E
50|$|The final {{decision}} {{to restart the}} trams {{was made by the}} city council on 29 March 1990. In the mean time, the City List had changed their political support for the 1989 mayor election. Instead of supporting the Labour candidate Per Berge, they instead chose to support the Conservative Marvin Wisethâ€”who took over as mayor 1 January 1990. The Conservative Party was more than willing to support <b>any</b> <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> involved privatization.

50|$|However, <b>any</b> <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> the House of Lords {{was being}} unduly servile to Parliament were {{overturned}} {{by the decision}} in A v Home Secretary 2005. In the case, a group of detainees who had been imprisoned without charge under s.23 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 {{on the grounds that}} they posed a threat to national security, appealed successfully against their detention. The court held that the powers of detention without charge violated Convention rights because of their discriminatory impact (articles 5 and 14 Human Rights Act 1998).|$|R

500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{going to be}} called Red Dragon, like the novel. Michael Mann, who called the new title [...] "inferior", said that producer Dino De Laurentiis made the change after Michael Cimino's film Year of the Dragon, produced by De Laurentiis, bombed at the box office in 1985. William Petersen has commented that another reason for the change was to avoid <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> it might be a karate movie. [...] "At the time, Bruce Lee was knocking out Dragon movies, and Dino, in his wisdom, decided people would think it was a kung-fu movie", he later recalled. Brian Cox, who played jailed killer Hannibal Lecktor, has also expressed disdain for the film's title, calling it [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "cheesy".|$|E
500|$|Justice Harlan {{advocated}} a broad {{interpretation of the}} Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. He subscribed to the doctrine that the clause not only provided procedural guarantees, but also protected {{a wide range of}} fundamental rights, including those that were not specifically mentioned in the text of the Constitution. (See substantive due process.) However, as Justice Byron White noted in his dissenting opinion in Moore v. East Cleveland, [...] "no one was more sensitive than Mr. Justice Harlan to <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> his approach to the Due Process Clause would lead to judges 'roaming at large in the constitutional field'." [...] Under Harlan's approach, judges would be limited in the Due Process area by [...] "respect for the teachings of history, solid recognition of the basic values that underlie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles that the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers have played in establishing and preserving American freedoms".|$|E
500|$|... 23 April {{also saw}} {{the release of the}} debut album by the leading punk rock band in the New York scene, the Ramones. Though it is {{regarded}} as seminal to the growth of punk rock in England and elsewhere, Lydon has repeatedly rejected <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> it influenced the Sex Pistols: [...] " [...] were all long-haired and of no interest to me. I didn't like their image, what they stood for, or anything about them"; [...] "They were hilarious but you can only go so far with 'duh-dur-dur-duh'. I've heard it. Next. Move on." [...] On 11 May, the Pistols began a four-week-long Tuesday night residency at the 100 Club. They devoted the rest of the month to touring small cities and towns in the north of England and recording demos in London with producer and recording artist Chris Spedding. The following month they played their first gig in Manchester, arranged by Devoto and Shelley. The Sex Pistols' performance of 4 June at the Lesser Free Trade Hall set off a punk rock boom in the city.|$|E

Instead of supporting the Labour candidate Per Berge, they instead chose to support Marvin Wiseth from the Conservative Party, who took over as mayor 1 January 1990. The reason was that the Labour Party was not willing to give a clear support to the tramway operation.

500|$|Hannah was {{promoted}} to air marshal on 1January 1970, and succeeded Air Marshal Sir Alister Murdoch as Chief of the Air Staff. Murdoch had earlier recommended Hannah, {{known to be a}} strong advocate for Australian participation in the Vietnam War, for the position of Commander Australian Forces Vietnam when it came up for rotation at the end of 1969; the post went to an Army officer, and the Federal government ordered the withdrawal of the RAAF presence in Vietnam during Hannah's tour as CAS. In March 1970, the Minister for Defence, Malcolm Fraser, commissioned a review of naval air power. Hannah fundamentally disagreed with <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> the Royal Australian Navy should operate land-based aircraft, claiming that he was arguing not from a partisan perspective but to ensure that Australia's limited defence resources were not spread across three services. Confidential RAAF papers from the time declared that its goal was always to [...] "avoid giving the Navy the opportunity to establish a land-based air force". Two years later, Hannah responded favourably to a recommendation from the Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, Admiral Sir Victor Smith, to use the soon-to-be-delivered F-111 bomber for maritime support, among other roles.|$|E
500|$|Although Northrup did {{not speak}} out {{publicly}} against her ex-husband following their divorce, she broke her silence in 1972. She wrote privately to Paulette Cooper, {{the author of the}} book The Scandal of Scientology who was subsequently targeted by the Church's Operation Freakout. Northrup told Cooper that Hubbard was a dangerous lunatic, and that although her own life had been transformed when she left him, she was still afraid both of him and of his followers, whom she later described as looking [...] "like Mormons, but with bad complexions." [...] In July 1986 she was interviewed by the ex-Scientologist Bent Corydon several months after Hubbard's death, which had reduced her fear of retaliation. Excerpts from the interview were published in Corydon's 1987 book, [...] She died of breast cancer in 1997 but in the last few months of her life she dictated a tape-recorded account of her relationship with Hubbard. It is now in the Stephen A. Kent Collection on Alternative Religions at the University of Alberta.

500|$|Some {{employees}} of ANA speculated that approximately ten minutes after take-off {{the crew of}} Amana {{were aware of the}} seriousness of rough running on number 4 engine so decided to shut it down. Company procedures specified that if an operational problem occurred prior to reaching Kalgoorlie, [...] east of Perth, the aircraft was to return to Perth; but if a problem occurred after reaching Kalgoorlie the flight could continue to Adelaide. The Douglas DC-4 was capable of flying from Perth to Adelaide with one engine inoperative. The crew of Amana on the fatal flight might have decided to wait until past Kalgoorlie before making a radio call to report one engine had been shut down, and then continue to Adelaide. To manage fuel usage and balance the weight of fuel across the wing, the crew might have selected some of the operating engines to draw fuel from number 4 tank. The DC-4 had a complex fuel selection system and, either deliberately or inadvertently, all operating engines might have been connected to number 4 tank. If the drain cock in the cross-feed pipe was still open to the atmosphere, air would be drawn into the pipe, causing an interruption of fuel supply to the engines, all engines to stop operating and their propellers to move to fine pitch. When the crew realised engines 1, 2 and 3 had all suddenly failed and that cross-feeding of fuel was the source of the problem they would have changed the fuel selections and restored fuel to the engines, causing the sudden screaming noise heard by witnesses as the engines burst back into life with their propellers in fine pitch. Amana had been flying at lower altitude than usual so there was inadequate height for the crew to arrest the high rate of descent before the aircraft struck high ground on the Inkpen family property. (At the Air Court of Inquiry, George Pape, representing ANA, described as [...] "fantastic" [...] <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> the crew of the Amana would be cross-feeding fuel from one wing to the engines on the other wing at such an early stage of the flight.) ...|$|E
