[...] The Xiongnu emissary replied, [...] "The King looks handsome and extraordinary. However, the man who was carrying a sword and standing beside him is a real hero."

6000|$|But what I {{complain}} of is, that when men {{have got the}} freedom, {{three out of four}} of them will not use it. What?--someone will answer--Do you suppose that I will not say what I choose, and that I dare not speak my own mind to any man? Doubtless. But are you sure first, that you think what you choose, or only what someone else chooses for you? Are you sure that you make up your own mind before you speak, or let someone else make it up for you? Your speech may be free enough, my good friend; and Heaven forbid that it should be anything else: but <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> free likewise? Are you sure that, though you may hate bigotry in others, you are not somewhat of a bigot yourself? That you do not look at only one side of a question, and that the one which pleases you? That you do not take up your opinions at second hand, from some book or some newspaper, which after all only reflects your own feelings, your own opinions? You should ask yourselves that question, seriously and often: [...] "Are my thoughts really free?" [...] No one values more highly than I do the advantage of a free press. But you must remember always that a newspaper editor, however honest or able, is no more infallible than the Pope; that he may, just as you may, only see one side of a question, while any question is sure to have two sides, or perhaps three or four; and if you only see the side which suits you, day after day, month after month, you must needs become bigoted to it. [...] Your thoughts must needs run in one groove. They cannot (as Mr. Matthew Arnold would say) [...] "play freely round" [...] a question; and look it all over, boldly, patiently, rationally, charitably.|$|E

Yet he is a talented, an original-minded man, and even he does not like you; your self-respect defies you to like him; he has always seen you to disadvantage; he always will see you to disadvantage; your positions are unequal, and were they on the same level your minds could not; assimilate; never hope, then, to gather the honey of friendship out of that thorn-guarded plant.

5000|$|Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher {{has gained}} {{positive}} reviews. Many {{people find it}} fun and refreshing. Kids enjoy it.

What <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> about the social implications of [...] "magic" [...] in the lives of our children? Is the use of [...] "magic" [...] in your books just fantasy, just fun?A: Sometimes kids do a much better job at telling the difference between fantasy and reality than a group of adults. Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher has been taken off the shelf in one school district for what they called [...] "satanic content"—the presence of the dragon, the chicken livers, the silver gleam, and the use of black and red colors here and there in the book. It went back on the shelf after a protracted discussion and once I got involved in the issue. But I can't address magic across the spectrum because different people have different feelings about it. I can only say that, for me, fantasy is a way of telling an amusing and engaging story and fantasy fiction sometimes addresses important issues at a deeper level than realistic fiction does. C. S.

The research began from these guiding questions: What <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> on the recreational team work and the activities they do?

The most well accepted activities were music and games the clowns provided. We suggest implementing the humanization by using ludic resources...|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{breast cancer}} treatment, {{aromatase}} inhibitors (AI) and tamoxifen (Tmx) are frequently used. In this study, {{the relationship between}} the hormonal therapy and arthralgia in women with breast cancer was studied. Methods: Sixty-four patients of whom 32 taking AI and 32 taking Tmx were included into the study. VAS was used to determine the intensity of pain. Also five options Likert scale was applied to all patients to answer the question &# 147;what <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> about the sources of your current pain?&# 148;. As laboratory parameters, CBC, BUN creatinine, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, CRP, ESR, ANA, RF, and estradiol levels of the patients were analyzed. Results: The mean age of the AI group was 52. 7 &# 177; 8. 2 years and in the Tmx group, it was 47. 4 &# 177; 6. 5 years (p 0. 05, for each). Conclusion: In our study, more frequent and severe arthralgia has been observed in patients under AI treatment when compared to tamoxifen. One of the causes that leads to arthralgia in patients using AI may be low levels of estradiol. [Cukurova Med J 2013; 38 (1. 000) : 78 - 85...|$|E
3000|$|The {{human factors}} work {{examined}} the driver–cab {{in terms of}} the design of the tram-driving task itself and its cognitive demands. The methods in this component also included cab walkthroughs, driving observations, and unstructured interviews, and these were undertaken as previously described. However, this component also included a series of focus groups. These lasted 1.5 – 2  h, conducted with 4 – 6 tram drivers per group, and included a scenario simulation task [20]. This task required each of the participants to create challenging driving scenarios, as a means to overcome conversation-based limitation, but also stimulate situational insight. These methods has been previously applied in the heavy rail industry and have been very effective for identifying specific cognitive task demands, and illustrating how driver’s stabilise the task in the face of conflicting goals [20]. Example questions for the general focus group were “What <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> on the [specific class] tram?” and “take me through a challenging part of a route that you drive over.” Example questions for the scenario simulation task were “create a really hard stretch of track” and “imagine you have to drive over your route.

40|$|Aims/ Intent: Historical French Salons {{aimed to}} provide a venue for {{intellectual}} discourse. Transcending time, present day salons and Socratic Cafés provide a creative outlet for artists, scientists and philosophers to exchange ideas and advance thought and creativity. The salon venue provides a means to both embrace and distance from peer review; at times analytical distance is necessary for advancement of thought and idea (Sawhney, 2013). This forum will briefly discuss the history of salons, their use in present day society, and articulate the potential for advancing ideas in occupational science. The session will end with a brief, one hour salon to explore pre-identified and emerging ideas related to occupational science and potential future directions for the national and global research societies and {{for the advancement of}} the state of the science. Rationale: In an era that has seen a growth in OS research societies around the world, occupational science literature has also expanded to include text books, journals, blogs, and informal means of idea exchange. The salon forum is a unique means to provide reflection (Petty, 2010) and idea exchange beyond the traditional conference format. Outcomes: From this session participants will: 1 - Describe the history and format for salons and their potential to advance occupational science. 2 - Engage in a salon based discussion designed to advance ideas related to national and global efforts to grow and disseminate knowledge of occupational science. 3 - Acquire the skills to utilize a historical methodology with the values of collaboration and critical discourse designed to facilitate sharing and perspective taking to serve humanity. Discussion Questions (*Note, the salon is designed to generate the questions; these are guiding discussion suggestions) 1 - Discuss the state of occupational science and suggestions for future directions for the global societies, discourse, and research. 2 - What recommendations would you have for the future of educational efforts in occupational science? 3 - How do our students best come to know and understand occupational science? 4 - What <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> on the state of occupational science and how it needs to be nurtured in its growth to meet the needs of society...|$|E
