Perhaps his most significant contribution was the design of an effective counter-measure to the German magnetic mines. During his Christmas lunch in 1939 he was called away to help design a system that would neutralise the mines <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> port of Harwich, Essex. Nine days later, he had successfully completed the task.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{produced}} {{his plans}} and local Uxbridge builder William Fassnidge {{was employed to}} construct the church. On St Peter’s Day, 29 June 1864, the foundation stone was laid {{at the south end}} of the chancel arch by the Lord Bishop of London, Archibald Campbell Tait. He returned less than a year later to consecrate <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> church on the feast of SS Philip and James, 1 May 1865.|$|E

5|$|Chocobo Tales {{features}} {{a mix of}} three different types of gameplay; role-playing video game, exploration, and card battles. Players explore a 3D environment to find picture books. Upon finding them the player is transported into pop-up picture books to complete minigames <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> path to the next part of the story. The picture books {{take the form of}} Aesop's Fables and Grimm's Fairy Tales with the player character often taking the main role. Other Final Fantasy characters take up roles within the stories. More simplistic minigames, known as microgames, are also scattered throughout the world. Unlike minigames, these are not located within pop-up books, do not affect the game-world and are not required to progress in the game.|$|E
5|$|Joining the Battle of Hürtgen Forest, the {{division}} moved into defensive {{positions in the}} vicinity of Wuustwezel, Belgium on 23 October 1944. The Timberwolves were then assigned to British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery's Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group under the British I Corps, along with the U.S. 7th Armored Division, in order to clear out the Scheldt Estuary <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> port of Antwerp. While the U.S. 7th Armored Division was assigned static duty holding the right flank of the gains made during the failed Market Garden operation, the 104th Infantry Division was to assist the First Canadian Army in the taking of the Scheldt. The Timberwolves traveled across France by train and debarked near the Belgian-Dutch border and waited for word to attack, taking the place of the experienced British 49th Infantry Division on the left flank and the Polish 1st Armored Division on the right.|$|E

5|$|The club {{succeeded in}} a further legal {{challenge}} bought by small firms in January 2005 as the High Court upheld {{a decision by}} then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to grant a compulsory purchase order {{in support of the}} scheme. The stadium later became issue in the local elections in May 2006. The Metropolitan Police restricted supporters' coaches to being parked in the nearby Sobel Sports Centre rather than in the underground stadium car park, and restricted access to 14 streets on match days. These police restrictions were conditions of the stadiums' health and safety certificate which the stadium requires to operate <b>and</b> <b>open.</b> <b>The</b> road closures were passed at a council meeting in July 2005.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Woodruff's {{clinical}} transplant program was recognised and enhanced by {{funding from the}} Nuffield Foundation to construct <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> Nuffield Transplant Surgery Unit at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. In 1970 an outbreak of hepatitis B struck the transplant unit, resulting {{in the death of}} several patients and four of Woodruff's employees due to fulminant hepatic failure. Woodruff was deeply shaken by the loss and the unit was closed for a period while an investigation was carried out to develop a contingency plan to avoid such a disaster in future. The unit then resumed operations.|$|E
5|$|Other {{spirits are}} also said {{to remain at}} The Octagon as well. Dolley Madison's spirit has been seen near the {{fireplace}} in the main ballroom as well as heading through a closed door to the garden, and her ghost's presence is accompanied {{by the smell of}} lilacs, her favorite flower. A slave girl in the house was allegedly thrown from the third floor landing to the first floor below and killed by a British soldier during the War of 1812, and eyewitnesses have reported hearing her scream. The specter of a British soldier in War of 1812 dress was seen by caretaker James Cypress in the 1950s, and museum superintendent Alric H. Clay claimed that in the 1960s spirits would often turn on the lights <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>The</b> Octagon's doors late at night. A gambler shot to death in the house's third-floor bedroom in the late 19th century has sometimes been seen still in the bed he died in, and ghostly footmen have been seen at the front door waiting to receive guests. He was said to have rung a bell shortly before his death and that the ring of the bell often heard in the house is from him. Various witnesses have also reported hearing assorted moans, screams, and footsteps.|$|E

25|$|Restoration {{efforts on}} the Florida Tropical House were started in 1997, with the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana searching for {{potential}} lessees to restore the building.
