We performed a retrospective cohort study to evaluate long-term outcome {{of patients with}} X-ALD. All patients with X-ALD diagnosed between 1989 and 2012 were included. Electronic patient charts were reviewed for clinical features, biochemical investigations, molecular genetic testing, neuroimaging, long-term outcome and treatment. Forty-eight patients from 18 unrelated families were included (15 females; 33  males). Seventeen patients were symptomatic {{at the time of}} the biochemical diagnosis including 14 with neurocognitive dysfunction and 3 with <b>Addison</b> <b>disease</b> only. Thirty-one asymptomatic individuals were identified by positive family history of X-ALD. During follow-up, eight individuals developed childhood cerebral X-ALD (CCALD), one individual developed adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), six individuals developed <b>Addison</b> <b>disease</b> only, and five individuals remained asymptomatic. Direct sequencing of ABCD 1 confirmed the genetic diagnosis in 29 individuals. Seven patients with CCALD underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Nine patients lost the follow-up. There was no correlation between clinical severity score, Loes score and elevated degree of elevated very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) levels in CCALD.

40|$|BackgroundAutoimmune {{disease is}} one of the leading causes of {{morbidity}} and mortality worldwide. In <b>Addisons</b> <b>disease,</b> the adrenal glands are targeted by destructive autoimmunity. Despite being the most common cause of primary adrenal failure, little is known about its aetiology. MethodsTo understand the genetic background of <b>Addisons</b> <b>disease,</b> we utilized the extensively characterized patients of the Swedish Addison Registry. We developed an extended exome capture array comprising a selected set of 1853 genes and their potential regulatory elements, for the purpose of sequencing 479 patients with <b>Addisons</b> <b>disease</b> and 1394 controls. ResultsWe identified BACH 2 (rs 62408233 -A, OR = 2. 01 (1. 71 - 2. 37), P = 1. 66 x 10 (- 15), MAF 0. 46 / 0. 29 in cases/controls) as a novel gene associated with <b>Addisons</b> <b>disease</b> development. We also confirmed the previously known associations with the HLA complex. ConclusionWhilst BACH 2 has been previously reported to associate with organ-specific autoimmune <b>diseases</b> co-inherited with <b>Addisons</b> <b>disease,</b> we have identified BACH 2 as a major risk locus in <b>Addisons</b> <b>disease,</b> independent of concomitant autoimmune diseases. Our results may enable future research towards preventive disease treatment.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—We {{sought to}} define the {{prevalence}} of nonislet, organ-specific autoantibodies at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and to determine the prevalence of comorbid autoimmune diseases. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Children (n = 491) diagnosedwithtype 1 diabetes at the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes were screened for autoimmune thyroid disease (thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies [TPOAb]), celiac disease (tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies [TTGAb]), and <b>Addison</b> <b>disease</b> (21 -hydroxylase autoantibodies [21 OHAb]). RESULTS—Of the 491 children, 161 {{had at least one}} nonislet autoantibody, and of these, 122 (24. 8 %) were positive for TPOAb, and 15 of the 122 (12. 3 %) had autoimmune thyroid disease. There were 57 (11. 6 %) who were positive for TTGAb, of whom 14 (24. 6 %) had celiac disease. Five (1. 0 %) were positive for 21 OHAb, of whom one had <b>Addison</b> <b>disease.</b> CONCLUSIONS—Many autoantibody-positive subjects present with additional autoimmune disorders. Detection of these autoantibodies at type 1 diabetes onset may prevent complications associated with delayed diagnosis of these disorders. Type 1 diabetes occurs in one in 300 individuals (1) and is associated with other autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune thyroid disease (AIT) in 15 – 30 %, celiac disease (CD) in 4 – 9 %, and <b>Addison</b> <b>disease</b> (AD) in 0. 5 % (2); detection of which is crucial to prevent morbidity related to unrecognized disease. Assays for thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (TPOAb) in AIT, tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (TTGAb) in CD, and 21 hydroxylase autoantibodies (21 OHAb) in AD, may be used to screen for asymptomatic disease to identify risk of progression to overt disease.

40|$|PURPOSE: Asthma {{includes}} immunological {{components that}} may share mechanisms with autoimmune diseases. We analyzed the subsequent occurrence {{of any of}} 22 autoimmune and related conditions in hospitalized asthma patients. METHODS: A nationwide {{study was conducted in}} Sweden on subsequent diseases of asthma patients {{on the basis of the}} Hospital Discharge Register. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for subsequent autoimmune diseases. RESULTS: A total of 4006 patients were hospitalized for an autoimmune condition after last hospitalization for asthma. The SIRs were increased for 11 subsequent autoimmune conditions, diagnosed at least 5 years after asthma. The highest SIRs were noted for polyarteritis nodosa (4. 29) and <b>Addison</b> <b>disease</b> (3. 62). SIRs for these diseases and others, including the most common autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis, were increased even when the follow-up was started 5 years after the last asthma hospitalization. <b>Addison</b> <b>disease</b> and Crohn disease were increased in asthma patients hospitalized at various ages, whereas young asthma patients presented with celiac disease and immune thrombocytopenic purpura. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized asthma patients presented with a number of subsequent autoimmune and related diseases.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Mitotane is an adrenocytolytic agent used in adrenocortical carcinoma, {{inducing}} adrenal insufficiency, requiring replacement treatment. Such {{therapy is}} not easy to monitor because of mitotane interference. Salivary cortisol reflects a free fraction of plasma cortisol and may be useful in such patients. DESIGN: The aim of our study was to evaluate salivary cortisol by HPLC coupled to tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) in patients treated with mitotane. We enrolled 6 patients receiving mitotane and 2 <b>Addison</b> <b>disease</b> patients as negative controls and determined salivary cortisol rhythm. We also determined the salivary cortisol rhythm in 8 healthy subjects. Salivary samples (n= 112) were assayed by ECLIA, using Roche Modular E 170, and by LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: The mean values obtained by ECLIA were significantly higher than those obtained by LC-MS/MS in the mitotane group (p< 0. 001). In fact, in the group measured by LC-MS/MS, we observed several peaks eluting at a retention time different from the cortisol group, presumably due to cortisol-like analogues. In <b>Addison</b> <b>disease,</b> since steroidogenesis is absent, salivary cortisol values measured by the two methods did not show any significant difference (p= 0. 61). CONCLUSIONS: Salivary cortisol measured by LC-MS/MS is a selective method, excluding cortisol analogues accumulating in treated patients.

Sensitivity (< 1 µg cortisol/ 100 ml), accuracy, precision and specificity of the method are reported. Normal values of 9. 00 a. m. serum cortisol (9. 7 – 32. 0 µg/ 100 ml) and of values before and after ACTH infusion tests were determined.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Prosthetic joint {{infection}} due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis is occasionally {{encountered in}} clinical practice. To {{the best of}} our knowledge, this is the first report of a prosthetic joint infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis complicated by psoas abscesses and secondary <b>Addison</b> <b>disease.</b> Case presentation A 67 -year-old immunocompetent Caucasian woman underwent total left hip arthroplasty because of osteoarthritis. After 18 months, she underwent arthroplasty revision for a possible prosthetic infection. Periprosthetic tissue specimens for bacteria were negative, and empirical antibiotic therapy was unsuccessful. She was then admitted to our department because of complications arising 22 months after arthroplasty. A physical examination revealed a sinus tract overlying her left hip and skin and mucosal pigmentation. Her levels of C-reactive protein, basal cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and sodium were out of normal range. Results of the tuberculin skin test and QuantiFERON-TB Gold test were positive. Computed tomography revealed a periprosthetic abscess and the inclusion of the left psoas muscle. Results of microbiological tests were negative, but polymerase chain reaction of a specimen taken from the hip fistula was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Our patient's condition was diagnosed as prosthetic joint infection and muscle psoas abscess due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and secondary <b>Addison</b> <b>disease.</b> She underwent standard treatment with rifampicin, ethambutol, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide associated with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. At 15 months from the beginning of therapy, she was in good clinical condition and free of symptoms. Conclusions Prosthetic joint infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is uncommon. A differential diagnosis of tuberculosis should be considered when dealing with prosthetic joint infection, especially when repeated smears and histology examination from infected joints are negative. Clinical outcomes of prosthetic joint infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis are unpredictable, especially given the limited literature in this field and the uncertainty of whether medical treatment alone can eradicate the infection without prosthesis removal. Furthermore, this case report raises interesting issues such as the necessity of a follow-up evaluation after treatment based on clinical conditions, the utility of a more standardized length of treatment for periprosthetic tuberculous infection, and the importance of a high diffusion capacity of anti-mycobacterial agents in order to eradicate the infection. </p...|$|E

(2) In the older brother of this family we observed a severe and lethal lung disease; this case adds to a growing literature describing this association between APECED and respiratory illnesses. (3) Tryptophan hydroxylase antibodies might be hypothesized to be the marker of an autoimmune gastrointestinal illness possibly associated with APECED...|$|E
40|$|True {{ossification}} of ear auricles is exceptional. We {{present the}} first case linking this finding to post-partum hypopituitarism. A 57 -year-old female presented with a 2 -day history of fever, headache and behavioural disturbances. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was normal. Since cerebral spinal fluid could not be obtained, she was treated empirically for a meningitis. A urinary tract infection was subsequently identified {{as the cause of}} fever but when she improved she remained apathetic. At this time petrified auricles were noticed; histological examination revealed true ossification. Endocrinological screening showed partial hypopituitarism and thyroid autoimmune disorder. Initial symptoms could be dated to the birth of her last child 15 years before, with breast feeding difficulties, loss of body hair, and transient amenorrhoea. The absence of overt peripartum bleeding, resumption of menses 1 year later, preservation or recovery of some hypophyseal function, and presence of an associated autoimmune thyroid disorder and of hypophyseal tissue in a normal sella turca, all suggest lymphocytic hypophysitis rather than Sheehan syndrome as the primary disorder. Of the 15 patients reported to date with auricular ossification, two had <b>Addison</b> <b>disease.</b> The present case suggests that low cortisol is the key factor in this clinical finding...|$|E
40|$|Background: The <b>Addison</b> <b>disease</b> of the {{autoimmune}} etiology {{is mostly}} appearing {{as a part}} of APS 2 whereas the most dangerous is a combination of DM 1 and an autoimmune adrenalitis. The first evidence of adrenal insufficiency in DM 1 is a repetitive hypoglycaemia and lower insulin consumption. Changes in the HPA axis caused by either the activation of the immunity system during the APS 2 or by the structural changes in the insulin binding proteins may present the basis for the subclinical adrenal insufficiency. The functional adrenal disorders without autoimmune adrenalitis are frequently observed in autoimmune diabetes mellitus. ( [...] .) Conclusions: A rather slow autoimmune adrenalitis progress is observed in adult patients with autoimmune endocrinopathies but rarely ending with a full adrenal destruction. The adrenal antibodies importance is still under study. Higher adrenal disorder count in DM 1 patients with first manifestation around the age of 30 is presumed according to our results. Subclinical adrenal insufficiency is still very difficult to diagnose and new diagnostic ways 7 are recently being proposed. We have proven the advantages of salivary cortisol during the test as well as in daily profile. We have shown that adrenal disorders are not caused by cortisol binding peptide structure modifications in [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal {{dystrophy}} (APECED, OMIM 240300) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} disorder caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene located on chromosome 21 (21 q 22. 3). AIRE deficiency causes a loss in central immune tolerance, leading to the failure to eliminate autoreactive T cells in the thymus and allowing their escape to the periphery. Because of a founder effect, APECED is particularly prevalent in Finland (1 / 25, 000) but is observed worldwide with variable prevalence. APECED patients are susceptible to mucocutaneous candidiasis and multiple endocrine autoimmune diseases such as primary hypoparathyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, primary hypogonadism, type 1 diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypophysitis. They may also develop additional nonendocrine autoimmune diseases, such as alopecia areata/totalis, vitiligo, gastro-intestinal (GI) diseases, keratitis or tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN). In addition, the patients typically develop a variety of serum tissue-specific autoantibodies, which are predictive {{of the development of}} autoimmune disease and anticytokine antibodies such as those against type I interferons and Th 17 -related interleukin IL- 17 and IL- 22. The aim of this thesis was to study such manifestations of APECED that have not been well characterized before and also, to study health-related quality of life among Finnish APECED and Addison s disease/APS 2 patients. We evaluated the clinical GI features and searched for novel markers of GI dysfunction in a Finnish cohort of 31 APECED patients. The main upper GI symptoms were dysphagia and retrosternal pain (45 %) and the lower GI symptoms were constipation (48 %), diarrhoea (45 %) and malabsorption (16 %). Previously, L-amino-acid decarboxylase (AADC) and tryptophan hydroxylase type 1 (TPH- 1) antibodies have been demonstrated in APECED. AADC antibodies were found in 51 % and TPH- 1 antibodies in 39 % of all patients. Also, a T cell response to AADC was detected in 43 %. One third of the patients had autoimmune enteropathy (AIE) -related 75 kDa antigen (AIE- 75, 33 %) and villin (29 %) autoantibodies, and antibodies against brush borders and Paneth cells (PCs) were detected in 29 % and 20 %, respectively. Mucosal intestinal IL- 17 expression was decreased or negative in 77 % of the intestinal samples. Duodenal chromogranin A and serotonin expression was absent or decreased in 50 % and 66 % of the patients, respectively. Of the clinical symptoms, constipation correlated with negative serotonin staining (p less than 0. 05) and with AADC antibodies (p = 0. 019). Importantly, we found a correlation between autoantibodies against AADC, which are critical for serotonin and DOPA synthesis, and constipation. Constipation was also associated with a lack of serotonin expression in the enteroendocrine cells (EECs). Paneth cells (PCs) were lacking in the duodenum in 20 % of our intestinal samples, even though this was not associated with GI symptoms. In this Finnish APECED patient cohort, 17 % (5 / 30) had moderate-to-severe renal failure, including 10 % (3 / 30) with TIN requiring transplantation, haemodialysis or immunosuppressive treatment. However, the latter {{did not seem to be}} efficient in controlling disease progression. All 3 patients with TIN had circulating antibodies against the distal part of the nephron, as did 30 % of all cohort cases. The pathogenic relevance of such circulating antibodies is still unclear. The immunological basis of hypoparathyroidism in APECED was explored by studying circulating calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and NALP 5 antibodies. Although they were detected in 16 of 44 (36 %) and 13 of 44 (30 %) patients, respectively, we failed to find any clinically relevant statistical association. These APECED patients did not present circulating antibodies for other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, bullous pemphigoid or pemphigus vulgaris. Some patients had antinuclear antibodies at a low-titre without clinical significance. Secondly, we evaluated the health-related quality of life among Finnish APECED and Addison s disease/APS 2 patients and sought to determine which factors may predict a possible impairment. Using health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaires for APECED (SF- 36) and Addison s disease/APS 2 patients (SF- 36, 15 D), we indeed observed impaired HRQoL. For the APECED patients, general health, emotional well-being and energy/vitality were the most diminished aspects of HRQoL. Among the patients with Addison s disease/APS 2, compared to a large control population, physical or emotional role functioning, energy/vitality and general health were most affected. Discomfort and symptoms, vitality, and sexual activity were the most affected dimensions of the 15 D scores. Affiliation with a patients association, female gender, the presence of non-APS 2 inflammatory comorbidities, lower educational level and a longer disease duration were independent predictors of impaired HRQoL in these patients. Taken together, the results of this thesis show that APECED patients are genetically prone to develop autoantibodies to a multitude of tissue antigens but are still tolerant to some common autoantigens. The true clinical and biological relevance of these circulating autoantibodies has not yet been elucidated, and it is possible that they are only a reflection of T cell-mediated immunity. They may, however, have a cumulative effect and clinical disease may arise only in patients with a combination of circulating antibodies, as seen in diabetes type 1. This may explain why we failed to find any association between any single type of antibody and a given symptom. For the lower GI track manifestations, we hypothesise a cumulative effect of the autoimmunity directed against both the enteroendocrine cells and the Paneth cells, leading to a dysfunction in both the secretion of serotonin in the gut and the secretion of antimicrobiobial defensins. Such a disturbance would have an effect on the gut microbiota. The question of whether the neutralising antibodies against cytokines may have a paradoxical protective effect is open to debate. Lastly, despite having a high number of manifestations, patients with APECED seem to cope with their <b>disease.</b> Patients with <b>Addison</b> s <b>disease</b> have significantly impaired HRQoL compared to the general population. Autoimmuunipolyendokrinopatia-kandidiaasi-ektodermidystrofia (APECED, OMIM 240300) on harvinainen, autosomissa peittyvästi periytyvä sairaus, joka aiheutuu mutaatioista kromosomissa 21 (21 q 22. 3) sijaitsevassa autoimmune regulator (AIRE) geenissä. AIRE:n toiminnallinen puutos johtaa n. s keskusimmuunitoleranssin menetykseen siten että autoreaktiiviset T-solut eivät tuhoudu kateenkorvassa vaan pääsevät karkaamaan perifeeriseen verenkiertoon. APECED:in esiintyvyys Suomessa on erityisen korkea (1 / 25, 000) johtuen ns. perustaja-mutaatiosta AIRE-geenissä, mutta tautia tavataan myös muualla maailmassa vaihtelevalla esiintyvyydellä. APECED-potilaat ovat alttiita ihon ja limakalvojen krooniselle hiivatulehdukselle ja heillä voi esiintyä useita autoimmuunitauteja, kuten lisäkilpirauhasen, lisämunuaisen kuoren, kilpirauhasen sekä sukuelinten vajaatoimintaa, tyypin 1 diabetesta ja aivolisäkkeen tulehdusta. Näiden lisäksi APECED-potilaat kärsivät usein myös muista ei-endokriinisistä autoimmuunitaudeista kuten pälvikaljusta (alopesia), valkopälvestä (vitiligo), silmän sarveiskalvon tulehduksesta, munuaisputkien tulehduksesta (tubulointerstitiaalinen nefriitti, TIN),) sekä suoliston sairauksista. Potilailla havaitaan tyypillisesti seerumissa erilaisia kudos- ja elinspesifejä autovasta-aineita sekä vasta-aineita useita tulehdusvälittäjäaineita eli sytokiineja kohtaan. Viime mainitut kohdistuvat tavallisimmin tyypin I interferonia sekä Th 17 -immuunivasteeseen liittyviä interleukiineja IL- 17 ja IL- 22 kohtaan ja ennakoivat autoimmuunitaudin puhkeamista. Tässä väitöskirjassa on tutkittu tarkemmin kahta aiemmin huonosti tunnettua APECED:iin liittyvää oireistoa: ruoansuolatuskanavan sekä munuaisten ja virtsateiden oireita. Kyselytutkimuksen avulla kartoitimme potilaiden kokemat ruuansulatuskanavaperäiset oireet ja tutkimme suoliston toimintahäiriöiden tautimekanismia 31 suomalaista APECED-potilasta käsittävässä aineistossa. Tyypillisiä ylemmän ruoansulatuskanavan oireita olivat nielemishäiriöt ja rintalastan takainen kipu (45 %) ja alemman ruoansulatuskanavan osalta ummetus (48 %), ripuli (45 %) ja imeytymishäiriöt (16 %). Jo aiemmin on tiedetty APECED-potilailla esiintyvän vasta-aineita suoliston toiminnan kannalta keskeisten enteroendokriinisten (EE) solujen erittämiä entsyymejä tryptofaanihydroksylaasia (TPH- 1) ja aromaattista L-aminohappodekarboksylaasia (AADC) kohtaan. Potilasaineistossamme AADC-vasta-aineita esiintyi 51 %:lla sekä TPH- 1 vasta-aineita 39 %:lla potilaista. Uutena löydöksenä osoitimme T-soluperäisen immuunivasteen AADC:tä kohtaan 43 %:llä. Kolmasosalla potilaista oli osoitettavissa autovasta-aineita myös autoimmuuni enteropatiaan liittyvää antigeenia (AIE- 75) sekä ravinnon imeytymisestä vastaavien enterosyyttien mikrovilluksissa esiintyvää villiiniä vastaan. Lisäksi löysimme vasta-aineita suolen sukasaumaa (29 % potilaista) ja suolirauhasten Panethin soluja (20 % potilaista) vastaan. Suolen limakalvon IL- 17 :ää tuottavien solujen määrä oli alentunut tai puuttui 77 %:ssa tapauksista. Pohjukkaissuolen kromograniini-A-proteiinia tuottavien EE- solujen määrä oli vähentynyt tai puuttui 50 %:ssa ja vastaavasti serotoniinia tuottavien solujen määrä 66 %:ssa suolistonäytteistä. Potilaiden oireista ummetus korreloi negatiivisesti EE- solujen serotoniini-ilmentymisen (p alle 0. 05) sekä AADC-vasta-aineiden kanssa (p alle 0. 05). Huomionarvoista on, että havaitsimme merkittävän yhteyden ummetuksen ja serotoniini- ja dopamiinisynteesille keskeistä AADC-entsyymiä vastaan muodostuneiden vasta-aineiden välillä. Uusi havainto oli myös se, että suolistoon antimikrobisia defensiinejä tuottavat Panethin solut puuttuivat 20 %:ssa potilaiden duodenum-näytteistä, joskaan tämä ei suoraan korreloinut kliinisten oireiden kanssa. Tutkimistamme APECED- potilaista 17 % (5 / 30) kärsi keskivaikeasta tai vaikeasta munuaisen vajaatoiminnasta, ja 10 %:lla (3 / 30) potilaista oli TIN, joka vaati elinsiirteen, hemodialyysiä tai immunosuppressiivistä hoitoa. Näistä viime mainittu ei kuitenkaan osoittautunut riittäväksi taudinkulun hallinnoimisessa. Kaikilla kolmella TIN:istä kärsivällä potilaalla todettin verenkierrossa vasta-aineita nefronin distaalista osaa, munuaistiehyettä kohtaan. Samoja vasta-aineita löytyi kaikkiaan 30 %:lta aineistomme potilaista, mutta niiden merkitys TIN:in patogeneesissä on vielä tuntematon. Tutkimme myös APECED:issä esiintyvään lisäkilpirauhasen vajaatoimintaan liittyviä immunologisia taustamekanismeja määrittämällä verenkierrossa olevia kalsiumia tunnistavaa reseptoria (CaSR) ja NALP 5 -valkuaista kohtaan muodostuneiden vasta-aineiden määrän. Huolimatta siitä, että osoitimme vasta-aineita CaSR:ia vastaan 16 / 44 (36 %) potilaalla ja NALP 5 :ttä vastaan 13 / 44 (30 %) potilaalla, emme löytäneet kliinisesti relevanttia korrelaatiota. APECED-potilaillamme ei ollut veressään muussa väestössä tavallisten autoimmuunitautien kuten nivelreuman, keliakian, ihon autoimmuuni rakkulatautien (pemfigoidi ja pemfigus) vasta-aineita, mutta joillakin heistä oli matala-tiitterisiä tumavasta-aineita ilman niihin liittyviä kliinisiä muutoksia. Väitöskirjaan sisältyvät myös alkuperäistutkimukset potilaiden elämänlaadun kannalta keskeisistä tekijöistä ja terveyteen liittyvästä elämänlaadusta suomalaisilla APECED- ja Addisonin tauti/APS 2 potilailla. Käyttäessämme terveyteen liittyviä kyselytutkimuksia (SF- 36) APECED-potilailla sekä (SF- 36 sekä 15 D) Addisonin tauti/APS 2 -potilailla, kävi ilmi, että molempien potilasryhmien elämänlaatu oli alentunut. APECED-ryhmässä elämänlaatuun vaikuttivat negatiivisimmin heikentyneet yleinen terveydentila, henkinen hyvinvointi sekä energisyys/elinvoima. Addisonin tauti/APS 2 -potilailla elämänlaatuun negatiivisimmin vaikuttivat alentunut yleinen fyysinen ja emotionaalinen toiminta, terveydentila sekä energisyys/elinvoima. 15 D-kyselyn merkittävimmin muuttuneita tekijöitä olivat vaivat ja oireet, elinvoima sekä seksuaalinen aktiivisuus. Näiden potilaiden heikentyneeseen elämänlaatuun vaikuttivat eniten seuraavat erilliset tekijät: potilasyhdistykseen kuuluminen, naissukupuoli, muut kuin APS- 2 :een kuuluvat tulehdustaudit, alempi koulutustaso sekä pitkittynyt sairauden kesto. Tässä väitöskirjassa esitetyt tulokset osoittavat, että APECED-potilailla on runsaasti autovasta-aineita monia kudosantigeeneja vastaan mutta samalla potilaat ovat tolerantteja tietyille yleisille autoantigeeneille. Näiden kiertävien autovasta-aineiden lopullinen kliininen sekä biologinen merkitys on vielä tuntematon mutta on mahdollista, että ne ovat vain yksi T-soluvälitteisen immuniteetin osa-alue. On mahdollista, että näillä kiertävillä vasta-aineilla on kumulatiivinen vaikutus ja oireiden puhkeamiseen vaaditaan vasta-aineiden yhdistelmä, kuten on esimerkiksi tyypin 1 diabeteksessä. Tämä voisi selittää myös miksi yksittäisten vasta-aineiden ja kliinisten oireiden välillä ei tässä työssä aina voitu osoittaa merkitsevää assosiaatiota...|$|R

In this case control study, 86 patients with vitiligo were questioned about the location of vitiligo, family history, treatment and therapeutic response. All patients were examined both clinically and with laboratory tests to detect the presence of autoimmune disorders including autoimmune thyroid disease, pernicious anemia, insulin dependent diabetes, and Systemic Lupus Erythematic (SLE) and <b>Addison</b> <b>disease.</b> We compared the prevalence of autoimmune disorder in vitiligo patients with that in a group of age-and gender-matched normal population. Average age of disease onset was 21. 8 ± 11 years; 61 % of patients were female and 39 % were male. The most common locations of vitiligo were hands (33. 7 %) and face (32. 1 %). The most common pattern of onset was vulgaris type (40 %). Nearly one-fourth of patients had a positive family history of vitiligo. Prevalence of thyroid disorders in vitiligo patients and control group was 21. 1 and 7 %, respectively. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0. 008). The most common autoimmune disorder in patient with vitiligo was hypothyroidism. Family history had a poor prognostic effect on response to therapy...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} 16 previously unreported {{patients with}} histoplasmosis from Queensland and northern New South Wales, Australia, and review all previous Australian reports, providing 63 cases in total to study (17 cases of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, 2 cases of chronic pulmonary disease, and 44 cases of systemic disease, including 17 cases of single-organ infection and 27 instances of disseminated disease). All acute pulmonary disease was acquired in Australia, with 52 % of systemic disease definitely autochthonous. Most cases of single-organ disease occurred in immunocompetent patients (76 %), and were oropharyngeal (53 %) in location. Forty-one percent of disseminated disease occurred {{in patients with}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Patients with HIV had high rates of systemic symptoms, pancytopenia, fungemia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Oropharyngeal and adrenal involvement as well as systemic symptoms were prominent in immunocompetent patients with disseminated disease, with 6 of 7 cases of adrenal involvement leading to <b>Addison</b> <b>disease.</b> Most systemic disease was diagnosed by culture of Histoplasma capsulatum. Where serology was assessed in cases other than acute pulmonary disease, it was positive in only 32 %. Prognosis for patients with single-organ disease was excellent. Disseminated disease was associated with recurrence in 30 % and death in 37 %. The results of this study confirm several previously known patterns of disease but also provide new insights into this rare but endemic condition in Australia...|$|E
