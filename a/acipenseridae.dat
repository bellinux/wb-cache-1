50|$|The {{sturgeons}} of {{the family}} <b>Acipenseridae</b> have bony scutes along the sides and back and four barbels {{on the underside of}} the rostrum. A total of 25 extant species of sturgeon are recognized, including 17 within the genus Acipenser. Sturgeon are distributed around the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere (holarctic distribution) and have marine, freshwater, and anadromous members. Sturgeons, including the shovelnose, are highly regarded for their flesh and their roe, from which premium grades of caviar are made (Barton 2007).|$|E
5000|$|The beluga [...] or European {{sturgeon}} (Huso huso) is {{a species}} of anadromous fish in the sturgeon family (<b>Acipenseridae)</b> of order Acipenseriformes. It is found primarily in the Caspian and Black Sea basins, and occasionally in the Adriatic Sea. Heavily fished for the female's valuable roe—known as beluga caviar—the beluga is a huge and late-maturing fish that can live for 118 years. The species' numbers have been greatly reduced by overfishing and poaching, prompting many governments to enact restrictions on its trade.|$|E
50|$|The Japanese {{sturgeon}}, or Amur sturgeon (Acipenser schrenckii) is {{a species}} of fish in the <b>Acipenseridae</b> family {{that can be found}} in the Amur River basin in China and Russia. Claims of its presence in the Sea of Japan need confirmation. The species has 11-16 dorsal, 34-47 lateral, and 7-16 ventral scutes. Their dorsal fins have 38-53 rays and 20-35 anal fin rays. They also have greyish-brown backs and pale ventral sides. The species could reach up to 3 m in length, and weight over 190 kg. The species is considered to be critically endangered.|$|E
50|$|The Russian {{sturgeon}} (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), {{also known}} as the diamond sturgeon or Danube sturgeon, is a species of fish in the <b>Acipenseridae</b> family. It is found in Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Romania, Russia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine. It is also found in the Caspian Sea. This fish can grow up to about 235 cm and weigh 115 kg. Russian sturgeon mature and reproduce slowly, making them highly vulnerable to fishing. It is distinguished from other Acipenser species by its short snout with a rounded tip as well as its lower lip which is interrupted at its center.|$|E
5000|$|The Syr Darya {{sturgeon}} (Pseudoscaphirhynchus fedtschenkoi) is {{a species}} of fish in the <b>Acipenseridae</b> family. It is found in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, where it is endemic to the Syr Darya River and, before its drainage, the Aral Sea. Due {{to the loss of}} its breeding site and damming projects over the length of the river, it is currently considered Critically Endangered and likely extinct, as no sightings have been reported since 1960. The sturgeon is among the 25 “most wanted lost” species that are the focus of Global Wildlife Conservation’s “Search for Lost Species” initiative.|$|E
50|$|The bastard {{sturgeon}}, fringebarbel sturgeon, ship sturgeon, spiny sturgeon, or {{thorn sturgeon}} (Acipenser nudiventris) is {{a species of}} fish in the <b>Acipenseridae</b> family. Formerly abundant in the Black, Aral and Caspian seas, its range is now primarily limited to the Ural River (in Russia and Kazakhstan), with a possible relict populations in the Rioni River in Georgia and the Safid Rud in Iran. The healthiest population is one in Lake Balkhash in Kazakhstan, well outside its natural range, where they were introduced in the 1960s for commercial purposes. It {{has been reported that}} this fish has the highest relative fecundity for any sturgeon species.|$|E
50|$|White {{sturgeon}} (Acipenser transmontanus) are {{a species}} of sturgeon in the family <b>Acipenseridae.</b> They are also referred to by location, such as Pacific sturgeon, Kootenai River sturgeon, Columbia River sturgeon, and California white sturgeon. Their habitat ranges from the Aleutian Islands to Central California along {{the west coast of}} North America. They are an anadromous fish species; however, several populations became landlocked during the construction of dams which blocked their upriver migratory path to and from ancestral spawning grounds. White sturgeon are the largest freshwater fish in North America, and third-largest species of sturgeon after the beluga and kaluga sturgeons. White sturgeon are known to reach weights up to 816 kg (1,799 lb) and lengths up to 6.1 m (20 ft).|$|E
50|$|The Atlantic {{sturgeon}} (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus) is a North American {{member of}} the <b>Acipenseridae</b> family and is among the oldest fish species in the world. It {{is one of two}} subspecies of A. oxyrinchus, the other being the Gulf sturgeon, A. o. desotoi. The range of the Atlantic sturgeon extends from New Brunswick, Canada, to the eastern coast of Florida, United States. A disjunct population occurs in the Baltic region of Europe (today only through a reintroduction project). It was in great abundance when the first European settlers came to North America, but has since declined due to overfishing and water pollution. It is considered threatened, endangered, and even locally extinct in many of its original habitats. The fish can reach 60 years of age, 15 ft in length and over 800 lb in weight.|$|E
50|$|The Persian {{sturgeon}} (Acipenser persicus) is {{a species}} of fish in the family <b>Acipenseridae.</b> It {{is found in the}} Caspian Sea {{and to a lesser extent}} the Black Sea and ascends certain rivers to spawn, mainly the Volga, Kura, Araks and Ural Rivers. It is heavily fished for its flesh and its roe and is limited in its up-river migrations by damming of the rivers. Young fish feed on small invertebrates, graduating to larger prey such as crabs and fish as they grow. The threats faced by this fish include excessive fishing with the removal of immature fish before they have bred, damming of the rivers, loss of spawning areas and water pollution. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the fish as critically endangered and has suggested that the increased provision of hatcheries could be of benefit.|$|E
50|$|The green {{sturgeon}} {{is the most}} widely distributed member of the sturgeon family <b>Acipenseridae,</b> and {{is also the most}} marine-oriented of the sturgeon species. Green sturgeon are known to range in nearshore marine waters from Mexico to the Bering Sea, with a general tendency to head North after their out-migration from freshwater (NMFS 2005). They are commonly observed in bays and estuaries along the western coast of North America, with particularly large concentrations entering the Columbia River estuary, Willapa Bay, and Grays Harbor during the late summer (Moyle 2002, NMFS 2005). While there is some bias associated with recovery of tagged fish through commercial fishing, the pattern of a northern migration is supported by the large concentration of {{green sturgeon}} in the Columbia River estuary, Willapa Bay, and Grays Harbor, which peaks in August (NMFS 2005).|$|E
5000|$|Sturgeon is {{the common}} name for the 27 species of fish {{belonging}} to the family <b>Acipenseridae.</b> Their evolution {{dates back to the}} Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: Acipenser, Huso, Scaphirhynchus and Pseudoscaphirhynchus. Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, Polyodon spathula (paddlefish) and Psephurus gladius (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be [...] "true" [...] sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as [...] "primitive fishes" [...] because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. [...] Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 7-12 feet (2-3½ m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing 1,571 kg and 7.2 m long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Acipenseridae</b> {{comprises}} {{the largest group}} of non-teleostean actinopterygians and has served a central role in evolutionary studies of the Actinopterygii, and yet no comprehensive study of morphology and systematics of the family has ever been made. The family includes twenty-four species within four traditionally recognized genera, but the traditional generic designations lack rigorous definition within a cladistic scheme and are confounded by plesiomorphic characters. As background, revised diagnoses, synonymy lists, and overviews of life history are provided for every acipenserid species and genus. ^ The systematics of the <b>Acipenseridae</b> are addressed with emphasis on generic-level relationships based on characters from examinations of skeletal morphology. A complete description of the skeleton of the shovelnose sturgeon Scaphirhynchus platorynchus provides a template of the skeleton of acipenserids. Skeletal comparisons with representatives of the remaining three acipenserid genera (Huso, Acipenser, and Pseudoscaphirhynchus), as well as Polyodontidae, †Chondrosteidae, †Peipiaosteidae, and other actinopterygians were used to identify, define, and test putative synapomorphies. ^ Ninety-six synapomorphies are identified defining all major nodes within Acipenseriformes. A novel phylogeny of <b>Acipenseridae</b> is proposed, with Huso recognized as the sister group to a newly redefined subfamily Acipenserinae comprising all other acipenserids. The shovelnose sturgeons (genera Scaphirhynchus and Pseudoscaphirhynchus) compose a monophyletic Scaphirhynchini. No synapomorphies are recognized defining Acipenser, leaving the genus as a potentially untenable assemblage within <b>Acipenseridae.</b> ^ The proposed phylogeny suggests that evolution within <b>Acipenseridae</b> followed a markedly different course than typically assumed, with progressive increase in morphological specializations for benthic life. Huso and polyodontids (as immediate outgroups) define an outgroup morphology and life history founded on mid-water habitats and piscivory. In contrast, most acipenserines, and more markedly in scaphirhynchines, are more benthic as exemplified by their ventral jaws and substrate-oriented diets. ^ This phylogeny further suggests that peramorphosis, not paedomorphosis, {{played a central role in}} acipenserid evolution, exemplified by progressive acquisition of novel bones, increased scalation, and stronger dermal ornament. While putative paedomorphic characters are coincident with these peramorphic characters, addition of characters through peramorphosis belies the historical idea that paedomorphic or degenerate features dominate acipenserid evolution. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—The pre–Pleistocene {{fossil record}} of {{sturgeons}} (family <b>Acipenseridae)</b> from North America is reviewed {{based on a}} survey of reports in the literature and firsthand examination of specimens in museum collections. We provide a redescription of the only known specimen of †Protoscaphirhynchus squamosus (Late Cretaceous, Montana), a very poorly preserved specimen for which few morpho-logical details can be determined. Three taxa described as species of the genus Acipenser from North America (†A. albertensis, †A. eruciferus, and †A. ornatus) were described based on isolated and fragmentary remains, and are here considered to be nomina dubia. The earliest reported remains of North American sturgeons are from the Late Cretaceous (Santonian to Campanian Milk River For-mation). There is a relatively continuous record, {{with the exception of}} the Eocene and Oligocene, in which there are few (potentially in the Eocene) or no (Oligocene) known specimens available in collections. We have found that nearly all specimens are best regarded as <b>Acipenseridae</b> indeterminate genus and species due to their fragmentary preservation and lack of preserved diagnostic characters...|$|E
