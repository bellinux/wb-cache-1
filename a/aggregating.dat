40|$|ABSTRACT: In acute lung injury, a {{decrease}} in surface-active large <b>aggregates</b> {{and an increase in}} the less surface-active small surfactant <b>aggregates</b> are observed. The objective of the current study was to determine if the increase in small <b>aggregates</b> interfered with the function of large <b>aggregates,</b> thereby independently contributing to lung dysfunction. Isolated large <b>aggregates,</b> small <b>aggregates,</b> and large aggregatezsmall <b>aggregate</b> combinations were analysed for in vitro surface activity utilizing a pulsating bubble surfactometer. Subsequently, large <b>aggregates,</b> small <b>aggregates,</b> and large aggregatez small <b>aggregate</b> combinations were administered to surfactant-deficient, adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Physiological parameters were measured during 1 h of ventilation. After sacrifice, the whole lung lavage was analysed for protein concentration, and surface activity of the recovered large <b>aggregates.</b> The minimum surface tension of the large aggregatezsmall <b>aggregate</b> preparations (10 mN?m- 1) was significantly higher than large <b>aggregates</b> alone (1 mN?m- 1), but lower than small <b>aggregates</b> alone (21 mN?m- 1) after 100 pulsations. In vivo, rats receiving large aggregateszsmall <b>aggregates</b> showed immediate increases in oxygena-tion, similar to animals given large <b>aggregates,</b> whereas animals given small <b>aggregates</b> and control animals maintained low oxygenation values. In conclusion, small <b>aggregates</b> interfered with large <b>aggregates</b> function in vitro, but this was not observed in vivo in this experimental model...|$|R

This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the mechanical properties of fly ash artificial geopolymer <b>aggregates</b> with natural <b>aggregate</b> (rock) in term of its impact strength, specific gravity and water absorption. The raw materials used were fly ash, sodium hydroxide, sodium silicate and natural <b>aggregate.</b> After the artificial geopolymer <b>aggregate</b> has been produced, its water absorption, specific gravity and <b>aggregate</b> impact test has been done. All results obtained were compared to natural <b>aggregate.</b> The result shows that the fly ash geopolymer <b>aggregate</b> are lighter than natural <b>aggregate</b> in term of its specific gravity. The impact value for fly ash artificial geopolymer <b>aggregate</b> slightly high compared to natural <b>aggregate</b> while it has high water absorption value compared to natural <b>aggregate.</b> As conclusion, the fly ash artificial geopolymer <b>aggregate</b> can be used as one of the construction materials in concrete as an alternative for coarse <b>aggregate</b> besides natural <b>aggregate</b> with more lightweight properties...|$|R
