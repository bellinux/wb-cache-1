5|$|The bones show {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} and degenerative processes. Six skeletons showed evidence of Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans). The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that the occupant had been a knight. One skeleton showed signs of leprosy affecting bones in the face, hands and feet. No definite cases of tuberculosis directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs. The only major congenital abnormality found consisted of bony changes resulting from <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> <b>case</b> of Down's syndrome. Relatively minor congenital abnormalities of the spine were found in 19skeletons, ten of which were cases of spina bifida occulta. Other spinal abnormalities included fused vertebrae, spondylolysis and transitional vertebrae. Definite evidence of fractured bones was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases. One cranium contained a large circular lesion {{which may have been}} the consequence of trepanning. Other diseases specific to bones and joints were osteoarthritis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and possible cases of spondyloarthropathy. Three skeletons showed possible evidence of rickets, two had changes of osteoporosis, and three crania had features of hyperostosis frontalis interna, a metabolic condition affecting post-menopausal women. Osteomata (benign tumours of bone) were found in three cases.|$|E

50|$|Spinal dermoid cysts are benign ectopic growths {{thought to}} be a {{consequence}} of embryology errors during neural tube closure. Their reported incidence is extremely rare, accounting for less than 1% of intramedullary spinal cord tumours. It has been proposed that <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> 180 <b>cases</b> of spinal dermoid tumours have been identified over the past century in the literature.|$|R
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jimmy Savile scandal, Newsnight investigated the North Wales child abuse scandal. On 2 November 2012, a former resident of the Bryn Estyn children's home was reported on Newsnight claiming that a prominent, but unnamed, former Conservative politician had sexually abused him during the 1970s. The rumour was spread by users of Twitter and other social media which identified the politician. After The Guardian reported <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> <b>case</b> of mistaken identity, Lord McAlpine issued a strong denial that he was in any way involved, asserting that the allegations were wholly false and seriously defamatory. The accuser unreservedly apologised, admitting that, {{as soon as he saw}} a photograph of the individual, he realised he had been mistaken. The BBC also apologised.|$|E
500|$|Breeding in the bluespotted ribbontail ray occurs {{from late}} spring to summer; the male follows the female and nips at her disc, {{eventually}} biting and holding onto her for copulation. There {{is also a}} documented instance of a male holding onto the disc of a smaller male bluespotted stingray (Dasyatis kuhlii), in <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> <b>case</b> of mistaken identity. Adult males have been observed gathering in shallow water, which may relate to reproduction. Like other stingrays, this species is aplacental viviparous: the embryos are initially sustained by yolk, which later in development is supplemented by histotroph ("uterine milk", containing mucus, fat, and proteins) produced by the mother. The gestation period is uncertain, but {{is thought to be}} between four and twelve months long. Females bear litters of up to seven young, each a miniature version of the adult measuring around [...] across. Males attain sexual maturity at a disc width of the maturation size of females is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{a family}} member, Hakamada's mental health has badly {{deteriorated}} due to years in solitary confinement. According to an anti-death penalty activist that visited him in 2003, Hakamada was then claiming he had become [...] "the omnipotent God" [...] who had [...] "absorbed" [...] Iwao Hakamada, taken over the prison, and abolished {{the death penalty in}} Japan. A 2009 report on the death penalty in Japan by Amnesty International, said a psychiatrist had diagnosed Hakamada with [...] "institutional psychosis". In recent years, he had denied most visitation requests, including from family. Hakamada was admitted to a Tokyo hospital the day after his release to be treated for <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> <b>case</b> of diabetes.|$|E

2500|$|Poirot is reacquainted with Miss Carnaby, the {{companion}} from the {{episode of the}} Nemean Lion, whom Poirot praises {{as one of the}} most successful criminals he has ever met. She is worried as she constantly thinks of illegal schemes which she is sure would work and she fears she is turning into a hardened criminal. She wants to put her talents to good use and assist Poirot in fighting crime in any way she can. She also has brought to him <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> <b>case</b> in which she can prove herself. She has a friend, Mrs Emmeline Clegg, a widow who is comfortably off. In her loneliness, Mrs Clegg has found comfort in a religious sect called [...] "The Flock of the Shepherd", based in a retreat in Devon. Their leader, Dr Andersen, is a handsome, charismatic man. Mrs Clegg has made a will leaving all of her property to the Flock. Miss Carnaby is especially concerned as she knows of three women in a similar situation who have all died within the past year. She has investigated and found nothing unusual in the deaths, all of which were due to natural causes and none of them happened within the sanctuary but at the deceased's homes. Poirot asks Miss Carnaby to infiltrate the sect. She is to pretend to be dismissive of them and then, once within the sanctuary, be persuaded to be a convert.|$|E
60|$|But, my Lords, {{there are}} other affidavits, or {{whatever}} your Lordships may call them, that go much further. In order to give a color to the accusation, and make it less improbable, {{they say that the}} Nabob himself was at the bottom of it, and that he joined with his brother and his mother to extirpate out of his dominions that horrible grievance, the English brigade officers,--those English officers who were the farmers-general, and who, as we have proved by Mr. Hastings's own evidence, had ruined the country. Nothing is more natural than that a man, sensible of his duty to himself and his subjects, should form a scheme {{to get rid of a}} band of robbers that were destroying his country and degrading and ruining his family. Thus you see a family compact naturally accounted for: the Nabob at the head of it, his mother joining her own son, and a natural brother joining in the general interests of the family. This is <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> <b>case.</b> But is this the case pressed by them? No: they pass lightly over the legitimate son; they scarcely touch upon Saadut Ali Khân; they sink the only two persons that could give probability or possibility to this business, and endeavor to throw the whole design upon these two unfortunate women.|$|E
