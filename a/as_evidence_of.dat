25|$|Many Christians believe Jesus' miracles were {{historical}} events {{and that his}} miraculous works were {{an important part of}} his life, attesting to his divinity and the Hypostatic union, i.e., the dual natures of Jesus as God and Man.

5|$|Several {{scholars}} {{argue that}} there is no one High Priest who is the strongest candidate for identification with each of the Wicked Priest passages.

5|$|Adolf Hitler's {{sexuality}} {{has long}} been a matter of historical and scholarly debate. There is evidence that he had romantic encounters with a number of women during his lifetime, as well <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> his antipathy to homosexuality, and no evidence of homosexual encounters. His name has been linked to a number of possible female lovers, two of whom committed suicide. Another died of complications eight years after a suicide attempt, and one made a failed suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|After {{assuming}} {{office in}} 1897, United States President William McKinley signed {{the treaty of}} annexation for the Republic of Hawaii, but it failed to pass in the United States Senate after the Kūʻē Petitions were submitted by Kaulia, Kalauokalani, John Richardson and William Auld <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> the strong resistance of the Native Hawaiian community to annexation. Members of Hui Aloha ʻĀina collected over 21,000 signatures opposing an annexation treaty. Another 17,000 signatures were collected by members of Hui Kālaiʻāina but not submitted to the Senate because they were asking {{for the restoration of}} the queen and the delegates. The petitions were used <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> the strong resistance of the Hawaiian community to annexation and the treaty was defeated in the Senate. After the failure of the treaty, Hawaii was instead annexed by means of a joint resolution called the Newlands Resolution, in July 1898, shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War.|$|E

5|$|Fay {{damaged the}} roof of the airport's {{terminal}} building, causing the sprinkler system to malfunction and inundate parts of the structure with water; the resultant flooding crippled computer systems crucial to processing passenger information. The airport's radar was also impacted by the storm. In response to the damage, the airport was closed to all flights, though it quickly reopened to emergency diversions and non-commercial flights. Including subsequent damage from Gonzalo, about $2 million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> the need for a newer terminal in a more protected location.|$|E

The movie script is not based on scriptural sources. The fact that a cult has developed around the figure of Santoshi Ma has been cited by Anita Raina Thapan and Lawrence Cohen <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> Ganesha's continuing evolution as a popular deity.|$|E
5|$|Harvey Greenberg {{presents}} a Freudian reading in his The Movies on Your Mind, {{in which the}} transgressions which prevent Rick from returning to the United States constitute an Oedipus complex, which is resolved only when Rick begins {{to identify with the}} father figure of Laszlo and the cause which he represents. Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and that {{the most important aspect of}} the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> the different meanings which he has for each person.|$|E
5|$|Historians' {{opinions}} {{on the outcome of}} the battle are mixed, with some citing the withdrawal of Tegetthoff's ships, and the greater damage they sustained, <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> a tactical victory for Suenson. Other naval historians cite the lifting of the blockade as a strategic victory for the Austrians and Prussians, and others still describe the battle as inconclusive. The Battle of Heligoland was the last naval battle fought by squadrons of wooden ships, and it was also the last time Danish warships fought a major action. Jylland is preserved in Ebeltoft, the last surviving wooden-hulled, screw-driven warship.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, Fitzgerald {{suffered}} {{a third and}} final heart attack, and died believing his work forgotten. His obituary in The New York Times mentioned Gatsby <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> great potential that was never reached. However, a strong appreciation for the book had developed in underground circles; future writers Edward Newhouse and Budd Schulberg were deeply affected by it and John O'Hara showed the book's influence. The republication of Gatsby in Edmund Wilson's edition of The Last Tycoon in 1941 produced an outburst of comment, with the general consensus expressing the sentiment that the book was an enduring work of fiction.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 a {{population}} of P.fluviatile was discovered under the ruins of Trajan's Forum {{in the heart of}} Rome, living in canals built by the Etruscans which connect to the Cloaca Maxima. Based on a genetic analysis, which demonstrated that these crabs were similar to those in Greece, researchers believe that they had been brought by the Greeks before the founding of the city, some 3000 years ago. The crabs' unusual size, up to , and longevity (up to 15years) are also interpreted <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> a long-established population, by analogy with island gigantism.|$|E
5|$|In 211 BC an Aetolian {{assembly}} was convened {{for discussions}} with Rome. Laevinus {{pointed out the}} recent capture of Syracuse and Capua {{in the war against}} Carthage <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> Rome's rising fortunes, and offered to ally with them against the Macedonians. A treaty was signed. The Aetolians would conduct operations on land, the Romans at sea. Rome would keep any slaves and other booty taken and Aetolia would receive control of any territory acquired. Another provision of the treaty allowed for the inclusion of certain allies of the League: Elis, Sparta, Messenia and Attalus I of Pergamon, as well as two Roman clients, the Illyrians Pleuratus and Scerdilaidas.|$|E

5|$|In {{his final}} period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and {{completed}} three more major plays: Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest, {{as well as}} the collaboration, Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors. Some commentators have seen this change in mood <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> a more serene view of life on Shakespeare's part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day. Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen, probably with John Fletcher.|$|E
5|$|Israel {{continued}} {{to control the}} city until early June 1974, when it was returned to Syrian civilian control following the signature of a United States-brokered disengagement agreement signed on 31 May 1974. The surrender of Quneitra was controversial, with Israeli settlers and the Likud and National Religious Party opposing it. According to Michael Mandelbaum, the agreement provided {{that the city was}} to be repopulated to serve <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> peaceful Syrian intentions, by doing so it would encourage the Israelis to pull back further.|$|E
5|$|On 18 November, the British Admiralty, {{released}} a report that listed all of UB-43s first five victims <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> German wrongdoing. According to the British report, Italiana, Dewa, Lord Tredegar, and Elax—four of the twenty-two ships listed—had all been torpedoed without warning. This type of attack was counter to German pledges to adhere cruiser warfare, which required that ships be allowed time for the crews to escape before any attack could commence. UB-43s fifth victim, Welsh Prince, was on another list of 107 British ships sunk whose lifeboats had been fired upon by German submarines.|$|E
