500|$|Groza took 1960 off and {{did some}} {{scouting}} for the team. He also focused on an insurance business he started. [...] "I was 36 <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had retired", he said. The following year, however, {{he came back to}} the team at the urging of Art Modell, who bought the Browns that year. Not wanting to use a roster spot on a kicking specialist (Groza's back injury prevented him from playing on the line), Brown had signed Sam Baker to kick and play halfback. But Groza was eager to return and Modell insisted. Groza stayed with the team as a placekicker until 1967, and was on a Browns team that won the 1964 championship. Groza scored the first points in that game on a third-quarter field goal. He also kicked four kickoffs more than [...] and out of the Baltimore Colts end zone, preventing a return. Cleveland won 27–0.|$|E
500|$|After {{his brother}} died in 1929, Pond married Katherine N. de Nancrede, who was 47 years old, at a {{ceremony}} in Ann Arbor. [...] Pond said at the time, [...] "It's the first time I ever did it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> ought to be pardoned because of my youth." [...] Pond was also an amateur acrobat and remained a physical fitness buff all of his life. [...] At {{the time of his}} wedding in 1929, the Associated Press reported that he is [...] "almost as well known for his present athletic agility as for his architectural accomplishments. A part of his daily routine is to turn handsprings and flipflops and do other strenuous exercises." [...] He drew applause when, on his 80th birthday, he grabbed his bare knees with both hands and performed a backflip. [...] A photograph of Pond's feat was published in Life magazine in June 1937.|$|E
500|$|A bird-beaked {{member of}} the Green Lantern Corps who teaches Hal Jordan how to use his cosmic powers. Rush stated he was not {{initially}} familiar with Green Lantern but {{was drawn to the}} part after seeing the concept art explaining, [...] "When I got the offer for it I said, ‘Haven’t they made that film?’ They said, ‘No, it’s a completely computer-generated character.’ I saw the artwork and I said, I would love to be that guy. Because I had voiced an owl in [...] and I’d voiced a pelican in Finding Nemo <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could really improve on that now by being half-bird, half-fish, part lizard. You don’t get to do that in a live-action film." [...] Rush compared the role to previous roles where he played a mentoring figure, [...] "You could say that I’ve mentored Queen Elizabeth I as [...] Walsingham, and [...] Trotsky has mentored Frida Kahlo and now Tomar Re is going to mentor Hal Jordan, and I was sort of mentoring King George VI in The King's Speech. But I can’t imagine Tomar Re setting up an office on Harley Street in London. They’re all very different people to me, but {{there is a kind of}} theme I suppose".|$|E

500|$|Kahne {{appeared}} in victory lane {{in front of}} the crowd of 170,000 to celebrate his sixth win of the season earning him $305,889. Kahne was delighted with his victory and thanked the people who worked on his car's transmission and rear-end: [...] "We had a great car. It was unbelievable all night. I slammed it into second gear at the end of pit road one time <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had to break something. This isn't the special car. This car's been good two other times this year, but it went to waste. It's just an awesome team." [...] Second-place finisher Johnson said he finished the event where he ran in its duration: “I only made up ten points. But ten points is ten points.” Third-place finisher Burton was happy to recover from a tire issue from the previous race at Talladega Superspeedway. However, he was upset that he stalled his engine as he felt it cost him the chance of victory. Burton also said his late-race vibration was enough to scare him and was glad the race ended because of the amount of shudder coming from his car: [...] "I screamed, ‘We’ve got a wheel loose, we got a wheel loose’ and they said, {{we do not have a}} wheel loose, we know we got them tight." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Suede and America fuelled {{my desire}} to prove to {{everyone}} that Blur were worth it", Albarn told Mojo in 2000, [...] "There was nothing more important in my life." [...] Albarn felt the popularity American grunge music was enjoying in Britain at the time would soon run out of steam, and argued that Blur would embody a renaissance of classic British pop on their next album. Although the singer felt Blur had finally found their musical identity, not everybody was convinced with Albarn's new British-centric manifesto. Food Records owner David Balfe, in particular, strongly disagreed, and got into fierce arguments with Albarn over the proposed change in Blur's image. After the still-sceptical Balfe finally relented, Food warily gave Blur the go-ahead {{to work on their}} second album with Albarn's first choice of producer, Andy Partridge of XTC. Blur and Partridge began work at The Church, a studio in Crouch End owned by keyboardist Dave Stewart. However, the pairing didn't work out. Bassist Alex James described the sessions as a [...] "disaster"; he added that [...] "as it was all being put together, they were all good parts, but it just wasn't ... sexy". Partridge said in 1999 of the sessions: [...] "I felt quite fatherly <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> did sterling work. They got Dave ‘Twat’ Balfe really stoned to listen to some mixes and he was rolling around going, ‘This is fantastic, you're George Martin and they're The Beatles.’ Next day he'd say, ‘Quite frankly, Andy, this is shit.’" [...] The band successfully recorded four songs, but they were wary about working in the same conditions again.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the game}} Riley told reporters: [...] "I {{knew there were}} 14seconds left on the clock, and the initial read wasn't there.

[...] His first position at CNN was to anchor alongside Paula Zahn on American Morning. In 2002, he became CNN's weekend prime-time anchor. Since 2002, he has hosted CNN's New Year's Eve special from Times Square.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, at the Ichthus music festival, Mullins cited {{personal}} {{reasons for his}} move. He {{was asked if he}} made the move because God had called him to proselytize and convert the Native Americans. To this Mullins responded, [...] "No. I think I just got tired of a White, Evangelical, middle class perspective on God, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would have more luck finding Christ among the Pagan Navajos. I'm teaching music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Montoya seemed unscathed by the {{incident}} {{and may have}} been able to mount a legitimate fight for third spot, but he misunderstood a pit board message and came in for his only stop ten laps too early. [...] "I saw a sign out <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had to come in and the crew didn't know I was coming. Unluckily, it wasn't the time to come in yet." [...] The delay in servicing the car and the damage to their one-stop strategy meant Montoya was racing for fourth place from that point.|$|E

2500|$|While {{out walking}} on New Years Day 1987, Drummond {{formulated}} {{a plan to}} make a hip-hop record. However, [...] "I wasn't brave enough to go and do it myself", he said. [...] "...although I can play the guitar, and I can knock out a few things on the piano, I knew nothing, personally, about the technology. <b>And,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>I</b> knew Jimmy , I {{knew he was a}} like spirit, we share similar tastes and backgrounds in music and things.

2500|$|Carey {{attributed}} his subdued {{reaction to}} the perfect bid by saying, [...] "Everybody thought someone had cheated. We'd just fired Roger Dobkowitz, and all the fan groups were upset about it. ... I remember asking, 'Are we ever going to air this?' And nobody could see how we could. So I thought the show {{was never going to}} air. I thought somebody had cheated us, and I thought the whole show was over. I {{thought they were going to}} shut us down, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was going to be out of a job." [...] Kniess later defended his actions, claiming that he never cheated, and in the end, was awarded his prizes. (His feat can be comparable to the actions of Michael Larson, who appeared on the CBS 1980s game show Press Your Luck, and won $110,237 by memorizing the board sequence.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Shelby Metcalf {{took over}} the A {{basketball}} program in 1963. [...] His impact was immediate, winning the Southwest Conference with a 13-1 conference record for Texas A's first title in 13 years. [...] In his 26 years as head coach at Texas A, he won six Southwest Conference titles, two Southwest Conference tournament titles, and led A to six NCAA Tournament and four NIT appearances. [...] He was fired by former A football player and then-athletic director John David Crow after coaching 19 games of the 1989-1990 season. When asked by the media what happened between the two, Metcalf remarked, [...] "I made a comment that I didn't think John David was all that bright. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was being generous." [...] Metcalf finished his career at A with an overall record of 438306, making him the all-time winningest men's basketball coach in Southwest Conference history.|$|E

2500|$|Higgins {{arrived at}} the UK Championship stating that he was {{struggling}} for confidence and concerned that a poor result in the championship could cost him his top-16 ranking and his place at the Masters. However, he defeated Lee Walker 6–2, Jamie Cope 6–4, and Matthew Stevens 6–2 to reach the last 16, where he lost 5–6 to fellow Scot Anthony McGill. This was enough to keep him inside the top 16, at number 14. At the Masters, he faced Mark Allen in the first round. Even though he made three century breaks, including missing the yellow when on for a maximum break, Higgins lost the match 4–6. After the match, he said that [...] "I feel my form is steadily coming back – even when I've been losing matches I have still been gaining nuggets of confidence <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> played pretty well again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Merkerson {{made her}} {{television}} debut as Reba the Mail Lady on Pee-wee's Playhouse.

[...] "I didn't know who Pee-wee Herman was, so if, you know, for fans of the show, if they watch like the first episode that I ever did, I think it was a big party and he just kept making me laugh because I had never seen the character before. And the director was angry and he was like how can we get through this scene? And I said I {{have to look at the}} plate. So the entire [...] he's serving hors d'oeuvres, I'm looking at the plate, and we're still good buddies. He still, to this day, knows how to make me laugh like no one else, Paul Reubens". Merkerson has also appeared on The Cosby Show, among other series.|$|E
2500|$|Stokes {{scored a}} goal {{in each of}} Celtic's first two league games of the season, 3–0 and 6–1 wins over St Johnstone and Dundee United respectively. [...] However {{over the course of}} the season Stokes scored fewer goals than in {{previous}} seasons, mainly due to new manager Ronny Deila fielding him in a wide left role as opposed to his more recognised position as a striker. [...] Stokes' form at this time was often unimpressive, drawing criticism from supporters, and he was also disciplined by the club after he returned to Celtic late from a trip to his home city of Dublin. [...] Stokes continued to feature on the left wing for Celtic though, and it was from his cross that Kris Commons scored the opening goal on 15 March 2015 in Celtic's 2–0 win over Dundee United in the League Cup Final. [...] He commented after the final, [...] "I do need to show that I can still bring something to the team <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> did that today. I felt fresher and sharper. I thought I contributed." [...] A few days later, Stokes provided the assist for Jason Denayer's opening goal in a 4–0 win over Dundee United in a Scottish Cup quarter-final replay at Parkhead. [...] However, Stokes was sent off later in the same game for elbowing United's Paul Paton.|$|E

2500|$|From George Wilkins Kendall's {{account of}} the Texan Santa Fe Expedition: [...] "In their habits, they are clannish, social, and {{extremely}} convivial, never living alone like other animals, but, on the contrary, always found in villages or large settlements. They are a wild, frolicsome, madcap set of fellows when undisturbed, uneasy and ever on the move, and appear to take especial delight in chattering away the time, and visiting from hole to hole to gossip and talk over each other's affairs—at least so their actions would indicate. On several occasions I crept close to their villages, without being observed, to watch their movements. Directly in the centre {{of one of them}} I particularly noticed a very large dog, {{sitting in front of the}} door or entrance to his burrow, and by his own actions and those of his neighbors it really seemed as though he was the president, mayor, or chief—at all events, he was the 'big dog' of the place. For at least an hour I secretly watched the operations in this community. During that time the large dog I have mentioned received at least a dozen visits from his fellow-dogs, which would stop and chat with him a few moments, and then run off to their domiciles. All this while he never left his post for a moment, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could discover a gravity in his deportment not discernible in those by which he was surrounded. Far is it from me to say that the visits he received were upon business, or had anything to do with the local government of the village; but it certainly appeared so. If any animal has a system of laws regulating the body politic, it is certainly the prairie dog." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cornell was a {{close friend}} of late singer Andrew Wood, who was his roommate in Seattle. While living together, Cornell and Wood {{recorded}} the song [...] "Island of Summer", which was written by Cornell and is the only existing recording from the two of them singing together. The song was released in 2011 in the album [...] "Melodies & Dreams", a solo album from Andrew Wood featuring unreleased songs he recorded throughout his life. Wood's sudden death in 1990 led Cornell to make a tribute album for him with the band Temple of the Dog. In a 2016 interview with The Guardian promoting the first tour of Temple of the Dog, Cornell said about Wood's death: [...] "I've always had a really difficult time with loss. I didn't deal well with Andy's death. After he died, numerous times I'd be driving and I would look out the window <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> saw him. It would take me five minutes to update to the moment and realize, 'no, he's actually dead.' This tour, in a sense, is the dealing. It's facing the reality." [...] When asked if it is legitimate to read a songwriter's demise into his lyrics after the fact during a 1994 interview with Rolling Stone reflecting on Kurt Cobain's suicide, Cornell said; [...] "When Andy died, I couldn't listen to his songs for about two years after that, and it was for that reason— his lyrics often seem as though they can tell that story. But then again, my lyrics often could tell the same one. In terms of seeing everything as {{a matter of life and}} death— if that's what you're feeling at the time, then that's what you're going to write. It's sort of a morbid exchange when somebody who is a writer like that dies, and then everyone starts picking through all their lyrics. In Kurt's case, whatever he was thinking and whatever he was writing, there wasn't an arrow pointing at what his demise was. It's a stream of thought, it's a possibility— it's definitely something that somebody was feeling when they were writing. It doesn't mean that it's going to happen. But it doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't, either." ...|$|E
