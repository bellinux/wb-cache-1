[...] In 1842, Bird became the first to describe oxaluria, sometimes called Bird's disease, which is caused by an excess of oxalate of lime in the urine.Lee, p. 27Talbott, p. 599Schmidt, p. 342 [...] This is the second most common cause of kidney stones, the first being uric acid and its ammonium salt.

40|$|The {{suspension}} {{stability of}} blood, {{as measured by}} the rate of sedimentation of erythtocytes in plasma, has had wide application in medicine since F~hraeus (I) published the results of his investigations on the subject some twenty years ago. It is well known that the sedimentation rate is increased markedly in many pathological conditions, notably in acute infections. However, although a voluminous literature has grown, dealing with many aspects of this subject, the mechanism responsible for the observed differences in the sedimentation rates of normal and pathological blood is not well understood. Various workers have called attention to an apparent correlation between increases in the sedimentation rate and corresponding increases in serum globulin or fibrinogen levels. An excellent survey of the subject was made by Ham and Curtis (2), in which they discussed various techniques for measuring sedimentation rates, the influence of erythrocyte size and total volume on the rate of fall, and correlation with fibrinogen levels. In this paper, we shall report the results of studies on human blood in a number of pathological conditions, obtained by the method of electrophoresis.
