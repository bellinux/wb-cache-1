60|$|ALICE. He {{followed}} me about, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> before I knew you. I don't know why I quarrelled with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "It means," [...] he told her, with {{a forced}} smile, [...] "that your husband is, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in your {{expressive}} language, a fraud." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wonderful!" [...] said Lestrade. [...] "Wonderful! It's all {{as clear}} as crystal, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it.</b> But what {{is the object of}} this deep deception, Mr. Holmes?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Ordway {{has noted}} that [...] "Inking is a weird job, because <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> into <b>it,</b> the page still belongs to the penciler." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{do not go}} to Washington," [...] he said. [...] "You will {{understand}} that diplomatically, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> would <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> I do not exist. Neither is it necessary. I am here to listen." ...|$|R
6000|$|The worthy seaman, who {{was indeed}} an {{exceptionally}} good-looking tar, modestly replied--"Well now, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have <b>put</b> <b>it</b> so plump I don't mind if I do confess that I've had some wild suspicions o' that sort now and then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} it worth while, Mr. Trent? There is so much, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> to be explained, that the task, even to a man of your versatility, seems hopeless!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I never {{suggested}} {{that you should}} coerce her, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it.</b> I merely meant that you could point out to her, as a father, where her duty and happiness lie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's true,' said Mr. Underwood. 'A terrible {{disappointment}} that young dog {{has been to}} me, Felix Underwood; but <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> there's an honesty in the thing! Where is my fine gentleman?' ...|$|E
5000|$|Talking {{about the}} mystery in film, {{director}} Akhilesh Jaiswal says, [...] "My {{film is a}} fictional account of the writerâ€™s life. Even I am curious to know who the real brain behind the book is, or the real face behind the author, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it". <b>It</b> is not a pornographic film and he hopes to get an A Certificate from Censor Board without any cuts.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder!" [...] said Pyecroft, musing. [...] "But, after all, it's your steamin' gadgets he's usin' for his libretto, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> might <b>put</b> <b>it.</b> He said to {{me after}} breakfast only this mornin' 'ow he thanked his Maker, on all fours, that he wouldn't see nor smell nor thumb a runnin' bulgine till the nineteenth prox. Now look at him Only look at 'im!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It doesn't {{appeal to}} my client," [...] said the solicitor. [...] "He has, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> would <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> British prejudices. I don't intend to display all our program, but it {{includes}} a visit to your rivals {{and the men who}} finance you. Still, though you sometimes lay the paint on too thick, I have hitherto found you well-informed and square; and we should rather {{you did the right thing}} of your own accord." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you mean}} by that, that Captain Marshall went off {{to have a good}} time, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> I do not think so," [...] {{returned}} Phil, coldly. [...] "He is not that sort." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be {{very nice}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> but engagements end as well as begin," [...] I insisted. [...] "You cannot be a law unto {{yourself}} in these matters. When will you get married?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please don't apologize," [...] he said, humbly. [...] "I {{really have}} nothing to forgive. I am aware that I took a liberty, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> but I thought that I was {{justified}} by the circumstances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is no need}} {{to worry}} with such friends <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have got. <b>Put</b> <b>it</b> right out of your mind until {{business}} closes to-night, for there's a big pile {{of work to be done}} if you expect to make much money." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I don't {{know where}} you get off. Your redneck {{attitude}} is what's causing this whole thing," [...] the woman said. [...] "There's no way you're {{going to make us}} come off <b>as</b> welfare recipients. <b>You</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> right on the air and I just seen it. You had no damn business saying it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{told you}} once I only give the grist of his arguments. The Bosun's mate {{translates}} {{it to the}} lower deck, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> may <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> and the lower deck springs smartly to attention. It took us half the night 'fore we got 'er anyway ship-shape; but by sunrise she was beautiful as ever, and we resoomed. I've thought it over a lot since; yes, an' I've thought a lot of Antonio trimmin' coal in that tramp's bunkers. 'E must 'ave been highly surprised. Wasn't he?" ...|$|R
60|$|FRANK [staring] But this is ever so surprising! [He {{goes back}} to his chair]. I thought our whole {{relations}} were altered in your imagination and conscience, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> the moment those words were out of that brute's muzzle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Hilliard," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "on {{thinking}} it over <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> I {{do not know that}} I should be justified in refusing your offer. It is a very gallant one, and may possibly meet with success." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Dangle, [...] "we shan't HANG ABOUT, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it.</b> There are {{two places}} in Chichester where {{tourists}} might go--the cathedral and a remarkably fine museum. I shall {{go to the}} cathedral and make an inquiry or so, while Widgery--" ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2013, Ranaldo said in {{response}} to the question of a possible reunion, [...] "I fear not. Everybody is busy with their own projects, besides that Thurston and Kim aren't getting along together very well since their split. I think <b>you</b> can <b>put</b> a cross behind Sonic Youth, same <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can <b>put</b> <b>it</b> behind the names Mike Kelley and Lou Reed. Let them all rest in peace." [...] In her 2015 autobiography Girl in a Band, Gordon refers several times to the band having [...] "split up" [...] for good.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind girls," [...] said Fanshaw impatiently, [...] "there {{are plenty}} {{of them in the}} world, but not many things like the Pendragon Tower. As you may easily suppose, plenty of superstitions and scandals have {{followed}} in the track of the Spaniard's curse; and no doubt, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> would <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> any accident happening to this Cornish family would be connected with it by rural credulity. But it is perfectly true that this tower has been burnt down two or three times; and the family can't be called lucky, for more than two, I think, of the Admiral's near kin have perished by shipwreck; and one at least, to my own knowledge, on practically the same spot where Sir Peter threw the Spaniard overboard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She looked dubious. [...] "Uncle is so dreadful {{nervous about}} law business," [...] says she, [...] "that, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> know, he's <b>put</b> <b>it</b> off and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> off for years; and now to-day really I've feared it would verily drive {{him out of}} his mind. His poor three teeth quite chattered when I said to him that you would be here soon with the {{parchment}} writing. He always was afraid of agents, and folks that come for rent, and such-like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll tell you, however," [...] said I, [...] "whether {{you want}} to know or not. We said that <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed to be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{the best}} of my {{knowledge}} and belief, this is a public highway," [...] said Dave, as calmly as he could. [...] "You have no right to block the road, and I want you to clear that stuff away just as fast <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Allan, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> like that, {{the truth}} is that I heard {{something}} more about the Pongo than I told you up country. It was after I had operated on that Kalubi, or I would have tried to get in alone. But this I could not do then as I have said." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{imputation}} {{of being}} afraid, madam," [...] answered the doctor, solemnly, [...] "is not an imputation to cast rashly on any man--even when {{he belongs to}} such an essentially peaceful profession as mine. I am not afraid. I am (<b>as</b> <b>you</b> more correctly <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in the first instance) strangely depressed. My nature is, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> know, naturally sanguine, and I only see to-day what but for my habitual hopefulness I might have seen, and ought to have seen, a week since." ...|$|R
60|$|Ah, if I {{could look}} into the inside of people <b>as</b> <b>you</b> do, and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on paper, and invent things {{for them to do}} and say, and tell how they said it, I could writs a fine and {{readable}} book now, for I've got a prime subject. I've written 30,000 words of it and satisfied myself that the stuff is there; so I am going to discard that MS and begin all over again {{and have a good time}} with it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, I'm tellin' it slow, {{but it all}} 'appened much quicker. We {{run down}} our trampo--without o' course informin' Antonio of 'is 'appy destiny --an' inquired of 'er {{if she had any}} use for a free and gratis stowaway. Oh, yes? she said she'd be highly grateful, but she seemed a shade puzzled at our generosity, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> might <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> an' we lay by till she lowered a boat. Then Antonio--who was un'appy, {{distinctly}} un'appy--was politely requested to navigate elsewhere, which I don't think he looked for. 'Op was deputed to convey the information, an' 'Op got in one sixteen-inch kick which 'oisted 'im all up the ladder. 'Op ain't really vindictive, an' 'e's fond of the French, especially the women, but his chances o' kicking lootenants was like the cartridge--reduced to a minimum.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Martha, yes," [...] {{returned}} the bridegroom; [...] "no doubt it is <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it.</b> But after all, there's {{only one of}} His sayin's that has gone right home to me. I've got it by heart now--`I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.' 'Twould have bin all up with me long ago but for that, Martha." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you are {{certainly}} the coolest hand I ever came across," [...] O'Neil said. [...] "You are proposing {{to seize the}} first minister in England, {{as if it were}} merely an affair of carrying off a pretty girl quite willing to be captured. The idea seems monstrous, and yet, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> I do not see why it might not succeed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Weatherley, sir," [...] he declared, [...] "was, I believe, {{without any}} means {{whatever}} when Mr. Weatherley made her his wife. Mr. Weatherley, as you know, {{is at the}} head of this house, the house of Samuel Weatherley & Co., bankers Lloyds. It should be the business of the lady, sir, to see that she hits it off, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> with a husband who has done her so much honor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She's not playing"--Mr. Mitchett gravely {{confirmed}} it. [...] "Don't {{you feel}} in the very air the vibration of the passion that she's simply too charming to shake at the window as the housemaid shakes the tablecloth or the jingo the flag?" [...] Then he took up what Vanderbank had previously said. [...] "Of course, my dear man, I'm 'aware,' <b>as</b> <b>you</b> just now <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> of everything, and I'm not indiscreet, am I, Mrs. Brook? in admitting for <b>you</b> <b>as</b> well as for myself that there WAS an impossibility you and I used sometimes to turn over together. Only--Lord bless us all!--it isn't as if I hadn't long ago seen that there's nothing at all FOR me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fully {{recognize}} {{the truth of}} what you say, father," [...] he said, after a pause, [...] "and will think it deeply over, which I shall have time to do before my return from Holland. Assuredly it is not a matter to be lightly decided. It may mean that this royal service may lead to some position of profit as well as honour; although now, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have <b>put</b> <b>it</b> to me, I own that the prospect {{seems to me to be}} a slight one, and that where so many are ready to serve for honour alone, the chance of employment for one requiring money as well as honour is but small. However, there can be no need for instant decision. I am so fond of the sea that I am sure that, even if away from it for two or three years, I should be ready and willing to return to it. I am as yet but little over eighteen, and even if I remained in the royal service until twenty-one I should still have lost but little of my life, and should not be too old to take to the sea again.|$|R
5000|$|According to Langlotz' {{autobiography}} [...] During {{the winter}} and spring of the year 1859, some of the seniors and tutors use to meet with me in a little old house on Williams Street, {{just east of the}} college grounds, where we use to smoke and sing college songs over our glass of beer. When 'Old Nassau' was written, we tried to sing it to the air of 'Auld Lang Syne', but found this utterly unsuitable. Mr. William C. Stitt '56, one of the company,...suggested that I should write original music to the words...my memory was strengthened from day to day by Stitt who requested it for tomorrow...there I was sitting on my front porch smoking my peaceful pipe, when energetic Stitt arrived on the scene, and asked me in an off-hand way if I had anything particular to do that afternoon. I answered 'No'. Immediately he produced pencil and music paper saying 'Here is Old Nassau. Now do <b>as</b> <b>you</b> promised and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> the music to it.' I did write the music then and there, with Stitt standing guard over me. Carl A. Langlotz ...|$|R
