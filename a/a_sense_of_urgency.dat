5|$|Adan met Ya'iri at Adan's former command post. Adan briefly {{explained}} the situation and, {{in a short}} discussion, Ya'iri laid out his plan. He was tasked with clearing Akavish and Tirtur. At 11:30 PM, the paratroopers began moving, with a battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Yitzhak Mordechai spearheading the advance. Ya'iri, acting with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency,</b> had decided to go into action without awaiting sufficient intelligence, or performing adequate reconnaissance on Egyptian defenses. His unit lacked artillery observers and, rather than wait for one to arrive, it was agreed the paratroopers would request fire support of the 162nd Division's command net. The brigade was acting without armor support.|$|E

25|$|In fact, {{from the}} beginning, <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> gave the first Zionists the {{profound}} {{conviction that the}} task of reconquering the country had a solid moral basis. The argument of the Jews' historical right to the land was {{merely a matter of}} politics and propaganda. In view of the catastrophic situation of the Jews {{at the beginning of the}} century, the use of this argument was justified in every way, and it is all the more legitimate because of the threat of death hanging over the Jews. Historical rights were invoked to serve the need of finding a refuge.|$|E
25|$|The European Renaissance evoked in late Jagiellon Poland (kings Sigismund I the Old and Sigismund II Augustus) <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> in {{the need}} to promote a {{cultural}} awakening, and during this period Polish culture and the nation's economy flourished. In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus a Polish astronomer from Toruń, published his epochal work De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres), and thereby became the first proponent of a predictive mathematical model confirming the heliocentric theory, which became the accepted basic model {{for the practice of}} modern astronomy. Another major figure associated with the era is the classicist poet Jan Kochanowski.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the Liga Mayor, {{there was}} no {{national}} football league in Mexico, and football competitions were held within relatively small geographical regions. The winners of the Primera Fuerza, a local league consisting of teams near and around Mexico City, was considered the national competition. There were other regional leagues such as the Liga Amateur de Veracruz, the Liga Occidental De Jalisco and the Liga del Bajío that also had notable clubs. Many club owners were not keen {{on the idea of}} establishing a professional league, despite paying players under the table. With the increasing demand for football, there was <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to unite all the local amateur leagues in Mexico to progress as a football nation. The professional national league was finally established in 1943.|$|E

25|$|Training {{methods are}} {{as varied as}} the pigeons themselves. Some fanciers believe their system is the secret to their success and guard these hard learned lessons closely. Most fanciers will explain their basic {{strategy}} but some may be reluctant to share the details of their success. One of the most popular systems is widowhood. This system uses the birds desire to reproduce as motivation to try to give the bird <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> on race day. The use of widowhood is usually begun by first allowing the racer to raise a baby in their nest box. After the baby is weaned the hen is removed and often the nestbox is closed off, from then on the only time these birds are allowed to see their mate or enter the nest box is upon returning from training or a race. This conditioning {{is one of the key}} elements in a lot of racing programs.|$|E
25|$|This act {{begins by}} reestablishing {{the aura of}} romantic mystery which began Act 1. This is evoked {{by the use of}} high violins and wind chords together, similar to that of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring. The first {{movement}} is characterised by the constant change of tempo, while the second picks up influences from other musical styles in particular that of rhythmic impulse and swooning which characterised Ravel's work. The next movement features solid writing for a chorus of brass instruments, after which high violins are heard over a very low accompaniment. This section also features many solos for various instruments, followed by a pas de trois above a gently undulating accompaniment where lyrical melody lines are heard, with the oboe able to penetrate the whole texture in expressive fashion. The following variation is typical of 19th century ballet music and begins with the violins before spreading {{to the rest of the}} orchestra. Brass, prominent timpani and incisive pizzicato chords in the strings culminate in <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> in the music which prepares for the musical tension in the final act.|$|E
25|$|The {{garrison}} in Stirling Castle was {{in danger}} of succumbing to a lack of provisions, if not to Marebelle de Gordon’s siege, and with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, commander of the British-Hanoverian forces, departed with his army towards Linlithgow on 31 January 1746 and many of his troops took up their quarters in Linlithgow Palace. On hearing of the Duke’s arrival, Prince Charles sent his Secretary of State, Sir John Murray of Broughton to Lord George Murrray at Falkirk to prepare a battle plan. However Charles had recently received a letter from Lord George Murray explaining how his army had been weakened by desertion, was in no state to meet the enemy, and that it must retreat to the Highlands where it can spend the winter reducing government forts and recruiting itself to a strength of 10,000 men to operate a new campaign in the spring. As a result, the heavy guns on Gowan Hill were spiked and before day break on 1 February 1746 the Jacobite forces at Stirling and Falkirk withdrew making their way towards their rendezvous at St Ninians, abandoning the siege of Stirling Castle.|$|E

[...] The intention was to remind America what they were fighting for: {{freedom of speech and}} worship, freedom from want and fear.

500|$|Over {{the course}} of the group's existence, several hundred people joined and left. In the early 1990s, their {{membership}} dwindled, numbering as few as 26; these defections gave Applewhite <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency.</b> In May 1993, the group took the name [...] "Total Overcomers Anonymous". They then spent $30,000 to publish a full-page advertisement in USA Today that warned of catastrophic judgment to befall the Earth. Its publication led about 20former members to rejoin the group. This, along with a series of public lectures in 1994, caused membership to double from its nadir {{at the beginning of the}} decade.

500|$|In {{the closing}} chorale, [...] "" [...] (Amen, amen! Come, you fair crown of joy), Bach sets the Abgesang {{only of the}} final stanza of Nicolai's hymn. The musicologist Julian Mincham offers the thought: [...] "Conceivably the most convincing {{explanation}} lies, as it so often does, within the text– ... do not delay, I await You longingly. The hymn tune itself, through its very abbreviation implies <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> and {{the feeling of being}} unable to defer any longer." [...] In Bach's setting, the violin adds a jubilant fifth part to the four vocal parts. The violin has to [...] "climb three octaves to convey the extent of the soul's longing for the joys of a future life and the prospect of Jesus returning at the end of time".|$|E

Wiederhorn described Inflikted as an [...] "explosive flashback to the remorseless thrash and primal groove-metal Sepultura created between 1991's Arise and 1993's Chaos A.D. [...] The songs are raw and simple, yet graced with syncopated drum runs, experimental guitar flourishes, and sonic frills inspired by Max's love of reggae and Igor's fascination with DJ culture.
