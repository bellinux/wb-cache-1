25|$|Rare {{causes of}} {{hyperkalemia}} <b>are</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows.</b> Acute digitalis overdose such as digoxin toxicity may cause hyperkalemia through the inhibition of sodium-potassium-ATPase pump. Massive blood transfusion can cause hyperkalemia in infants due to leakage of potassium {{out of the}} red blood cells during storage. Giving succinylcholine tn patients with conditions such as burns, trauma, infection, prolonged immobilisation can cause hyperkalemia due to widespread activation of acetylcholine receptors rather than a specific group of muscles. Arginine hydrochloride is used to treat refractory metabolic alkalosis. The arginine ions can enter cells and displace potassium out of the cells, causing hyperkalemia. Calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, diazoxide, and minoxidil can cause hyperkalemia. Box jellyfish venom can also cause hyperkalemia.|$|E

50|$|The most {{integral}} part of any Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problem {{is the definition of}} its boundary conditions. Therefore, it is required that the user understands and uses the boundary conditions correctly, wisely and effectively and also understands its role in the numerical algorithm. If the boundary conditions are not specified correctly, then the solution might result in blunders and if they are not utilized wisely, then the problem solving time may increase manifold. Transient problems require one more thing i.e., initial conditions where initial values of flow variables are specified at nodes in the flow domain.

According to the theoretical derivation, the Neumann problem has the problems of spurious solutions using the imaginary-part formulation. We will prove that in the following. As mentioned earlier, spurious eigenvalues occur in the real-part of MRM formulation [9, 11, 12]. Also, the imaginary-part BEM results in spurious solutions [7]. Here, we will derive the true and spurious solutions in the discrete system analytically for a circular domain by using the non-dimensional in#uence function method [1] and the imaginary-part dual BEM [7] in a uni"ed way.

30|$|Combining {{electrical}} measurements with EELS {{results and}} structure characterization, the doping mechanism of P <b>is</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows.</b> From Raman and PL characterization, P-doped ZnO nanowires are of high quality. The possibility of imperfect lattice inducing high resistance of P-doped ZnO nanowires can be excluded. The native defects in P-doped ZnO nanowires are limited, thus the compensation effects from native defects are suppressed. Thus, P did not generated sufficient hole in as-grown P-doped ZnO nanowires though it mainly substitutes at oxygen sites from EELS analyses, which mostly because it induces a {{deep acceptor level}} in the ZnO band and may not provide effective conductive hole to contribute to p-type doping. In addition, {{due to the lack}} of zinc vacancy, the PZn cannot form effective P-doping configuration of PZn + 2 VZn and does also not generate sufficient hole.|$|R
