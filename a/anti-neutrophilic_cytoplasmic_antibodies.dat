40|$|The {{occurrence}} of perinuclear <b>anti-neutrophilic</b> <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> (p-ANCA) in pulmonary fibrosis {{has been reported}} in a number of small studies, however, the appearance of p-ANCA in already established idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), predating the manifestations of vasculitis has not been widely appreciated. We report 2 cases with radiographic evidence of established IPF where p-ANCA was negative at the time of diagnosis and became positive {{during the course of the}} disease, for a variable period of time, prior to the subsequent development of systemic vasculitis. Our cases suggest a possible rationale for serial p-ANCA measurements in patients with pulmonary fibrosis even in the absence of features suggestive of vasculitis. Furthermore, the required frequency of ANCA measurement in the absence of clinical features of vasculitis is unknown. Larger studies with repetitive p-ANCA measurement in tandem with ongoing clinical assessment for vasculitis are required to assess the prevalence of ANCA and to confirm our observation...|$|E
40|$|Following {{reports of}} {{associations}} between autoantibodies {{and living in}} the tropics, we have studied the seroprevalence and nature of anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-cardiolipin antibodies, antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens and <b>anti-neutrophilic</b> <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> in 351 West Africans with malaria, tuberculosis or hepatitis B, or in good health. Amongst healthy West Africans we found a seroprevalence of 7 % for anti-nuclear antibodies with several staining patterns, and of 30. 3 % for anti-cardiolipin antibodies. Among patients with tuberculosis and malaria there was twice that frequency of anti-nuclear antibodies (predominantly speckled in pattern), and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (predominantly IgM) were demonstrated in a few cases. A possible association between IgG anti-cardiolipin antibodies and tuberculosis was observed (P < 0. 05), but antibodies to double-stranded DNA were not elevated and no antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens were found {{in any of the}} patients or healthy individuals studied.

40|$|Introduction: Medication-induced leukocytoclastic {{vasculitis}} is a small-vessel vasculitis {{that most}} commonly manifests with palpable purpuric lesions on gravity dependent areas. Development of the vasculitis occurs within {{weeks after the}} initial administration of the medication, with clearance upon withdrawal of the medication. Glyburide, a sulfonylurea medication, is used to treat non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. We report a rare case of glyburide-associated leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Observation: We report a 71 -year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented with palpable purpura on the lower extremities. Cutaneous biopsy revealed superficial small vessel vasculitis with IgA perivascular deposits.   Further questioning revealed three prior episodes of palpable purpura after restarting the glyburide medication, with clearance upon discontinuation. We diagnosed drug-induced vasculitis related to the glyburide. Conclusions: This case highlights a rarely reported cutaneous adverse reaction to the commonly used diabetic medication, glyburide. Physicians should consider cutaneous vasculitis as a potential side effect of glyburide.

40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 67 -year-old female patient with {{microscopic}} polyangiitis presented with polyneuropathy of lower extremities and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Disease had started as a pain and weakening of muscular strength first in the left and than in the right leg. Electromiography has shown that a mainly dominant neurological affection was paresis of peroneal nerve in both lower extremities. In laboratory examination the titer of anti-myeloperoxidase <b>anti-neutrophilic</b> <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> (p-ANCA) was elevated.

40|$|Histologic {{vasculitis}} must {{be interpreted}} with caution, as there is considerable overlap in its clinical, histologic and immunologic presentations. Case report: A 42 year old woman presented with an plaque on the buttock that was tender to palpation, and had been present for six weeks. Physical examination revealed a large, erythematous plaque with focal areas of atrophy, pigmentation, small crusts, and small blisters. Skin biopsies for routine histology, direct immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical examination were taken. Methods: Skin biopsies for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) examination, {{as well as for}} direct immunofluorescence, indirect immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry studies were performed. Results: Examination of the tissue sections demonstrated an inflammatory process involving capillaries and small blood vessels within the dermis and panniculitic adipose tissue. Focal extravasation of red blood cells into the dermal interstitial tissue was also observed. A mild, focal, lobular panniculitis was also present. Direct immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry demonstrated deposits of several antibodies on vessels throughout the dermis. In addition, <b>anti-neutrophilic</b> <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> and neutrophil extracellular traps were identified. Conclusions: Few vasculitic processes have pathognomonic histologic findings.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{a case of a}} patient with HIV infection, {{diagnosed}} 18 months prior to the development of an anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis; this is probably the first report of such an association. A 30 -year-old white man presented with elevation of serum creatinine (1. 3 - 13. 5 mg/dL within one month). At admission, the urinalysis showed proteinuria of 7. 2 g/L and 8, 000, 000 erythrocytes/mL. Renal biopsy corresponded to a crescentic diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis mediated by anti-GBM, and serum testing for anti-GBM antibodies was positive; antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and <b>anti-neutrophilic</b> <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> (ANCA) were also positive. The patient underwent hemodyalisis and was treated with plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide and prednisone. The association described here is not casual, as crescentic glomerulonephritis is not common in HIV-positive patients, anti-GBM glomerulonephritis is rare and anti-GBM antibodies are frequently observed in HIV-positive subjects when compared to the overall population. Based on the current case and on the elevated frequency of the positivity for such antibodies in this group of patients, it is advisable {{to be aware of the}} eventual association between these two conditions and to promote an active search for anti-GBM antibodies and early diagnosis of eventual urinary abnormalities in HIV-positive subjects, considering the severity of anti-GBM glomerulonephritis.

40|$|Objectives: In this study, we {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the association of cancer with vasculitis {{and the frequency of}} cancer-related paraneoplastic syndromes and their relationship by measuring blood levels of Perinuclear type <b>Anti-Neutrophilic</b> <b>Cytoplasmic</b> <b>Antibody</b> (p-ANCA) and <b>Cytoplasmic</b> type antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> (c-ANCA) in patients with lung cancer and asthma and in healthy individuals. Materials and methods: 20 patients diagnosed with asthma, 26 patients following up with a diagnosis of lung cancer and control group of 20 healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. ANCA levels were measured in blood samples. Results: Borderline positive c-ANCA detected in 1 of 26 patients and 1 / 32 percent were positive detected in one patient. Borderline positive p-ANCA detected in 1 of 26 patients and 1 / 32 percent were positive detected in 1 patient. p-ANCA was positive detected in 2 / 20 of asthmatic patient and c-ANCA was borderline positive detected in 1 / 20 asthma patient. In asthma and cancer patients, physical examinations and pathological findings did not support the vasculitis. Only one subject in the control group was found to be borderline positive for c-ANCA. Conclusion: As a result, in some of the patients the positivity of ANCA was detected not related with vasculitis and paraneoplastic findings. Because of this, vasculitis should be considered in differential diagnosis of the patients whom considered as malignancy.

40|$|Renal {{transplantation}} (Tx) is {{the treatment}} of choice for end-stage renal disease. The incidence of acute rejection after renal Tx has decreased because of improving early immunosuppression, but the risk of disease recurrence (DR) is becoming relatively high, with a greater prevalence in children than in adults, thereby increasing patient morbidity, graft loss (GL) and, sometimes, mortality rate. The current overall graft loss to DR is 7 – 8 %, mainly due to primary glomerulonephritis (70 – 80 %) and inherited metabolic diseases. The more typical presentation is a recurrence of the full disease, either with {{a high risk of}} GL (focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis 14 – 50 % DR, 40 – 60 % GL; atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome 20 – 80 % DR, 10 – 83 % GL; membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis 30 – 100 % DR, 17 – 61 % GL; membranous nephropathy ∼ 30 % DR, ∼ 50 % GL; lipoprotein glomerulopathy ∼ 100 % DR and GL; primary hyperoxaluria type  1 80 – 100 % DR and GL) or with a low risk of GL [immunoglobulin (Ig) A nephropathy 36 – 60 % DR, 7 – 10 % GL; systemic lupus erythematosus 0 – 30 % DR, 0 – 5 % GL; <b>anti-neutrophilic</b> <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibody</b> (ANCA) -associated glomerulonephritis]. Recurrence may also occur with a delayed risk of GL, such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, sickle cell disease, endemic nephropathy, and sarcoidosis. In other primary diseases, the post-Tx course may be complicated by specific events that are different from overt recurrence: proteinuria or cancer in some genetic forms of nephrotic syndrome, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies-associated glomerulonephritis (Alport syndrome, Goodpasture syndrome), and graft involvement as a consequence of lower urinary tract abnormality or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) nephropathy. Some other post-Tx conditions may mimic recurrence, such as de novo membranous glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, microangiopathy, or isolated specific deposits (cystinosis, Fabry disease). Adequate strategies should therefore be added to kidney Tx, such as donor selection, associated liver Tx, plasmatherapy, specific immunosuppression protocols. In such conditions, very few patients may be excluded from kidney Tx only because of a major risk of DR and repeated GL. In the near future the issue of DR after kidney Tx may benefit from alternatives to organ Tx, such as recombinant proteins, specific monoclonal antibodies, cell/gene therapy, and chaperone molecules...|$|R

40|$|Background: We present here {{a case of}} {{haemorrhagic}} brain infarction in {{a middle-aged}} and physically active male, who had never smoked. This case report aims to remind the internist and neurologist {{to bear in mind}} unusual aetiologies of brain infarcts in patients without classical cardiovascular risk factors. Case Description: A 49 -year-old male with pulmonary asthma and a prior history of nasal polyps had a wake-up stroke with left-sided symptoms and speech disturbance. A head MRI and MR angiography revealed a recent haemorrhagic infarct in the right putamen and corona radiata. The left hemiparesis progressed to sensory-motor hemiplegia on the 4 th day. In the head CT, it was shown that the haemorrhagic infarct had progressed to a large haematoma. A pansinusitis was also diagnosed. The aetiological investigations revealed a minor atrial septal defect (ASD) with shunting and a heterozygotic clotting factor V R 506 Q mutation. A remarkable blood eosinophilia of 9. 80 E 9 /l (42 %) together with fever, sinusitis, wide-spread bilateral nodular pulmonary infiltrates that did not respond to wide-spectrum antimicrobial treatment, positive <b>anti-neutrophilic</b> <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies,</b> a high myeloperoxidase antibody level and slightly positive anti-proteinase 3 antibodies suggested the diagnosis of Churg-Strauss syndrome.

40|$|Idiopathic Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss (ISSNHL) is a rapid loss {{of hearing}} caused by {{damage to the}} cochlea (inner ear) or {{auditory}} nerve. Spontaneous recovery has been seen in 32 % - 81 %. The incidence of the ISSNHL has been estimated to be between 5 and 20 per 100, 000 per year. Different theories (infections, vascular catastrophes, immunologic damage or intracochlear membrane break) about the etiology have resulted in different treatment policies. The effect of therapy is difficult to evaluate for a single physician who sees just a few patients annually. The aim of the present thesis was to analyze the management and treatment of ISSNHL patients in Sweden with regard to outcome. A national database was developed for Sweden with half of all ENT clinics in Sweden participating by submitting a questionnaire for each patient with SSNHL. The questionnaire covered the patient’s background, current disorder, past and family history of different diseases, examinations and treatment. Audiograms {{at the onset of}} SSNHL and after three months were requested. All results were analyzed using ordinal logistic regression looking for interactions with hearing recovery and remaining hearing loss as dependent variables. Independent of treatment or no therapy heredity for hearing loss (I, II), older age (I, II) and presence of vertigo (II) was significantly associated with negative outcome. 40 % of all patients had an MRI or CT, where 3 – 4 % had acoustic neuroma. 24 % of patients with ISSNHL who had hematological tests taken had one or more pathological findings. Blood screening varied from simple routine tests to a complete analysis with such tests as HSP 70, <b>Anti-Neutrophilic</b> <b>Cytoplasmic</b> <b>Antibodies</b> (ANCA) and Borrelia tests. There was no association between any of these laboratory tests and either hearing improvement or remaining hearing loss evaluating the tests separately (I, II) or after categorization in comparison with those who had normal laboratory findings (II). Patients with hearing loss in the mid-frequency region had significantly better odds for hearing improvement compared to the other three frequency regions (low, high and “flat loss”). Almost 60 % of patients with ISSNHL were medically treated, of which nearly 90 % got corticosteroids. The medication had no association with either hearing improvement or remaining hearing loss. However, patients who were prescribed rest or sick leave had higher odds for hearing improvement regardless of other treatment. Those patients who did not receive any treatment at all also came significantly later to the ENT clinics than those treated medically and consequently had worse prognosis. Conclusion: There is no standard program for management or treatment of ISSNHL in Sweden. The diagnostic protocol varies. MRI is an underused resource to get specific diagnoses for the condition especially acoustic neuromas. Regardless of pathological findings, treatment is mainly limited to corticosteroids or no medication with no difference in outcome. A randomized placebo controlled study is necessary to evaluate whether there is an effect of corticosteroids on ISSNHL...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> are {{reported}} in patients with chronic liver disease, but controversy exists about their prevalence and specificity. We aimed to find the prevalence and specificity of antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> in chronic liver diseases by determination of antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibody</b> titre and IgG subclass. METHODS: One hundred and eight-four sera were studied: 63 primary sclerosing cholangitis, 28 autoimmune hepatitis, 34 primary biliary cirrhosis, 12 alcoholic liver disease, five large duct obstruction, four haemochromatosis, one chronic cholestatic syndrome, one cryptogenic cirrhosis and 36 normal individuals. Antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> were detected on alcohol-fixed neutrophils using an alkaline phosphatase technique. The IgG subclass of antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> was determined using monoclonal antibodies: HP 6001 for IgG 1, HP 6002 for IgG 2, HP 6050 for IgG 3 and SK 44 for IgG 4 (Sigma Immunochemicals). RESULTS: Antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> were detected in 65 % of primary sclerosing cholangitis patients at a serum dilution of 1 : 5, dropping to 49 % at 1 : 50. For autoimmune hepatitis, antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> were detected in 49 % at 1 : 5, dropping to 11 % at 1 : 50. Only 6 % of primary biliary cirrhosis patients were antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive at 1 : 5, dropping to 3 % at 1 : 50. All other controls were antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibody</b> negative at 1 : 5. The presence of antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> in primary sclerosing cholangitis correlated with involvement of the intra- and extrahepatic biliary tree (p = 0. 016, Fisher's exact test), but no other clinical parameters. Determination of the IgG subclass of antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibody</b> in 33 primary sclerosing cholangitis and 11 autoimmune hepatitis patients revealed a predominance of IgG 1 in both groups (94 % and 82 % of all IgG antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies,</b> respectively), with a similar distribution of IgG 2, IgG 3 and IgG 4 antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> are specific to the autoimmune liver diseases, particularly primary sclerosing cholangitis and autoimmune hepatitis. Titres are highest in primary sclerosing cholangitis, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 49 % and specificity of 89 % at 1 : 50, making it a useful serological marker for this disease. The lack of correlation with any marker of activity and the association of antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibody</b> with extent of biliary tract involvement suggest that antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> arises {{as a result of}} the disease or related process rather than being a cause of it. The detection of antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> in autoimmune hepatitis, together with a similar IgG subclass distribution of primary sclerosing cholangitis and autoimmune hepatitis antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies,</b> may reflect similar mechanisms of immune regulation and a possible overlap syndrome. Future identification of the antigens against which this antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibody</b> are directed should help to clarify this point, as well as allowing the development of a more sensitive and specific serological test for diagnostic purposes...|$|R

Neutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> were detected in 79 % of sera from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (n = 24), in 88 % of sera from patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis (n = 24) and in 28 % of sera from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (n = 25). The presence of neutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> in these diseases correlated significantly (p < 0. 008) {{with the presence of}} cirrhosis. Neutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> were not detected in nonautoimmune liver diseases. All neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive sera produced a perinuclear fluorescence pattern on ethanol-fixed granulocytes. On neutrophils fixed with paraformaldehyde, a granular cytoplasmic immunofluorescence pattern was observed, demonstrating the cytoplasmic nature of the antigen or antigens involved. Further characterization studies showed that neutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> in autoimmune liver diseases are not directed against myeloperoxidase, proteinase 3 or elastase, the neutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibody</b> specificities associated with necrotizing vasculitis, glomerulonephritis or both.

40|$|Abstract Background Anti-neutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> are {{typically}} detected in anti-neutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibody</b> associated vasculitis, {{but are also}} present {{in a number of}} chronic inflammatory non-vasculitic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Rare cases of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener’s granulomatosis, a vasculitic disorder frequently associated with the presence of anti-neutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies)</b> in patients with rheumatoid arthritis have been described in literature. Case presentation We report two middle-aged female patients with rheumatoid arthritis who developed anti-neutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> and symptoms reminiscent of granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Despite the lack of antibodies specific for proteinase 3 and the absence of a classical histology, we report a probable case of granulomatosis with polyangiitis in the first patient, and consider rheumatoid vasculitis in the second patient. Conclusion Taken together with previous reports, these cases highlight that anti-neutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> have to be evaluated very carefully in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

40|$|Anti-neutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies,</b> as {{detected}} by indirect immunofluorescence, have limited diagnostic significance as they {{occur in a}} variety of inflammatory disorders. The presence of antibodies to defined target antigens of anti-neutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies,</b> that is proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase, is, however, highly specific for one of the systemic vasculitides, in particular Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, and idiopathic pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis. In general, anti-proteinase- 3 -positive patients show more widespread organ involvement, more granuloma formation, and a more severe initial course of their renal lesions than anti-myeloperoxidase-positive patients; however, there is considerable overlap, and either antibody specificity may be found in the different clinical syndromes. In vitro, anti-neutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> are able further to activate pre-activated neutrophils and monocytes, which can result in endothelial damage. A direct activating effect of antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> on endothelial cells has been suggested, but those studies should be confirmed. In vivo, experimental data support a pathogenetic role for anti-neutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies,</b> particularly anti-myeloperoxidase, but besides anti-neutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> a second proinflammatory stimulus seems to be required to induce lesions. Whether anti-neutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> can be a direct target for treatment has still to be proved. Current immunosuppressive treatment regimens for the anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides are, however, unsatisfactory because of side-effects, that is opportunistic infections and malignancies. New treatment regimens, based on new pathogenetic concepts, are currently being tested. Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens 8 : 307 - 315. (C) 1999 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R

40|$|Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies {{have been}} {{detected}} in patients with some autoimmune and vascular diseases such as Wegner's granulomatosis, polyarthritis nodosa and systemic lupus erythematosus. Indirect immunofluorescence technique has been employed to detect these autoantibodies. By this method, two general patterns of antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> were seen: a cytoplasmic (C-ANCA) and a perinuclear form (P-ANCA). These antibodies have also been observed in uveitis. In this study, the presence of antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> in 25 patients with uveitis and its relationship with anatomical location of the autoimmune reaction was evaluated. According to the results, antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> were detected in 16 % (4 out of 25) of the patients, {{all of which were}} C-ANCA type. The results also showed that there was no significant correlation between the presence of antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> and anatomical location of the disease (p= 0. 65) ...|$|R

40|$|Background and objectives: Lupus nephritis is {{a classic}} immune complex glomerulonephritis. In contrast, antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> are {{associated}} with necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis, {{in the absence of}} significant immune deposits. Antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> are detected by indirect immunofluorescence in 20 % of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. We report 10 cases of necrotizing and crescentic lupus nephritis with antineutrophil cytoplas-mic antibody seropositivity. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: Ten patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibody</b> positivity, and renal biopsy findings of lupus nephritis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated glomerulonephritis were identified. The clinical features, pathologic findings, and outcomes are described. Results: The cohort consisted of eight women and two men {{with a mean age of}} 48. 4 yr. Perinuclear antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibody</b> was detected by indirect immunofluorescence in nine patients. Four of the nine patients and the single remaining patient were found to have myeloperoxidase–antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> by enzyme-linked immunosor-bent assay. Clinical presentation included proteinuria, hematuria, and acute renal insufficiency, with mean creatinine of 7. 1 mg/dl. All biopsies exhibited prominent necrosis and crescents with absent or rare subendothelial deposits and were interpreted as lupus nephritis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated glomerulonephritis.

40|$|Antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> have {{recently}} been demonstrated in sera of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We are reporting here our experience among 94 patients with Crohn's disease and 25 with ulcerative colitis. The indirect immunofluorescence assay with alcohol fixed neutrophils has been used. The presence of antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> was significantly associated to the ulcerative colitis 61 % VS 17 % (p < 0. 001). The fluorescence had a perinuclear pattern among all but one suffering from ulcerative colitis. Among the patients suffering from ulcerative colitis there was no relationship between the presence of antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> and the activity or the localisation of the disease. Among the 9 patients operated for their ulcerative colitis, 4 were ANCA positive and remained so after proctocolectomy. The existence of antineutrophil <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>antibodies</b> is useful for the diagnosis of some unclassifiable colitis. Their presence {{may be used as}} an argument in favour of some disturbances of the immunoregulation of the disease. Peer reviewe...|$|R
