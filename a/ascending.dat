5|$|<b>Ascending</b> cholangitis, {{also known}} as acute cholangitis or simply cholangitis, is an {{infection}} of the bile duct (cholangitis), usually caused by bacteria <b>ascending</b> from its junction with the duodenum (first part of the small intestine). It tends to occur if the bile duct is already partially obstructed by gallstones.|$|E
5|$|DCS {{is caused}} by a {{reduction}} in ambient pressure that results in the formation of bubbles of inert gases within tissues of the body. It may happen when leaving a high-pressure environment, <b>ascending</b> from depth, or <b>ascending</b> to altitude.|$|E
5|$|Many {{types of}} objects in {{abstract}} algebra can satisfy chain conditions, and usually if they satisfy an <b>ascending</b> chain condition, they are called Noetherian in her honor. By definition, a Noetherian ring satisfies an <b>ascending</b> chain condition on its left and right ideals, whereas a Noetherian group {{is defined as a}} group in which every strictly <b>ascending</b> chain of subgroups is finite. A Noetherian module is a module in which every strictly <b>ascending</b> chain of submodules becomes constant after a finite number of steps. A Noetherian space is a topological space in which every strictly <b>ascending</b> chain of open subspaces becomes constant after a finite number of steps; this definition makes the spectrum of a Noetherian ring a Noetherian topological space.|$|E

5|$|The Moon crosses {{from south}} to {{north of the}} {{ecliptic}} at its <b>ascending</b> node, and vice versa at its descending node. However, the nodes of the Moon's orbit are gradually moving in a retrograde motion, due to {{the action of the}} Sun's gravity on the Moon's motion, and they make a complete circuit every 18.6 years. This regression means that the time between each passage of the Moon through the <b>ascending</b> node is slightly shorter than the sidereal month. This period is called the nodical or draconic month.|$|E

5|$|The {{inclination}} of {{a planet}} tells how far above or below an established reference plane its orbit lies. In the Solar System, the reference plane is the plane of Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic. For extrasolar planets, the plane, known as the sky plane or plane of the sky, is the plane perpendicular to the observer's line of sight from Earth. The eight planets of the Solar System all lie {{very close to the}} ecliptic; comets and Kuiper belt objects like Pluto are at far more extreme angles to it. The points at which a planet crosses above and below its reference plane are called its <b>ascending</b> and descending nodes. The longitude of the <b>ascending</b> node is the angle between the reference plane's 0 longitude and the planet's <b>ascending</b> node. The argument of periapsis (or perihelion in the Solar System) is the angle between a planet's <b>ascending</b> node and its closest approach to its star.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of narcosis {{may be caused}} by other factors during a dive: ear problems causing disorientation or nausea; early signs of oxygen toxicity causing visual disturbances; or hypothermia causing rapid breathing and shivering. Nevertheless, the presence of any of these symptoms should imply narcosis. Alleviation of the effects upon <b>ascending</b> to a shallower depth will confirm the diagnosis. Given the setting, other likely conditions do not produce reversible effects. In the rare event of misdiagnosis when another condition is causing the symptoms, the initial management– <b>ascending</b> closer to the surface– is still essential.|$|E
5|$|A second {{effect is}} that a diver <b>ascending</b> to altitude, will be {{decompressing}} en route, and will have residual nitrogen until all tissues have equilibrated to the local pressures. This means that the diver should consider any dive done before equilibration as a repetitive dive, {{even if it is}} the first dive in several days.|$|E

5|$|The {{management}} of narcosis {{is simply to}} ascend to shallower depths; the effects then disappear within minutes.
