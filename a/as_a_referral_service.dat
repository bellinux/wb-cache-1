40|$|Pervasive social {{computing}} is {{a promising}} approach {{that promises to}} empower both {{the individual and the}} whole and thus candidates itself as a foundation to the "smarter" social organizations that our new turbulent and resource-scarce worlds so urgently requires. In this contribution we first identify those that we consider as the major requirements to be fulfilled in order to realize an effective pervasive social computing infrastructure. We then conjecture that our service-oriented community and fractal social organization fulfill those requirements and therefore constitute an effective strategy to design pervasive social computing infrastructures. In order to motivate our conjecture, in this paper we discuss a model of social translucence and discuss fractal social organization <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>referral</b> <b>service</b> empowering a social system's parts and whole.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{clinical}} presentation, treatment and outcome of tetanus in a European population. DESIGN: A retrospective study. SETTING: A large university {{hospital with a}} regional as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>referral</b> <b>service.</b> SUBJECTS: All patients with tetanus from 1983 till 1993. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (13 men, 14 women; mean age 68. 5 years) were studied. Seventeen out of 24 wounds (three patients had no history of a recent wound) were described as tetanus-prone. Ten patients had medical wound care, but none received tetanus immunoglobulins {{despite the absence of}} tetanus immunity. All patients had the generalized type of the disease. The classical symptoms of trismus, dysphagia and muscular rigidity were present in all patients. Treatment consisted of wound management, neutralization of tetanus toxin by immunoglobulins, antibiotics, treatment of muscle spasm and instability of the autonomic nervous system, and supportive care. Twenty-five patients were admitted to the intensive care unit for a mean duration of 25. 7 days. Sixteen patients were artificially ventilated for a mean duration of 27. 5 days. Three patients died, 11 patients had a complicated course caused by haemodynamic instability and 15 patients had pulmonary complications. CONCLUSIONS: Tetanus has not vanished. It remains a difficult-to-treat disease with a substantial morbidity and mortality rate. Prevention during wound management of tetanus-prone wounds was inappropriate in many patients. The elderly population may have the highest risk for tetanus since they may not have had tetanus toxoid immunization or regular booster injections. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{adoption}} of risk assessment tools {{has increased in}} popularity in {{the juvenile justice system}} due, in part, to recommendations by the Juvenile Justice Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA). However, very little is known about whether {{adoption of}} these tools actually effectuates change in the way young offenders are handled. Qualitative and quantitative data were gathered from 111 juvenile probation officers (JPOs) from six probation offices before and twice after standardized, rigorous implementation of the Structured Assessment of Violence Risk for Youth (SAVRY) or the Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (YLS/CMI). The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine JPOs 2 ̆ 7 changes in attitudes and case management decisions following implementation of a risk/needs assessment (RNA) tool. There was a significant reduction in JPOs 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the proportion of young offenders who would reoffend. There were many shifts in JPOs 2 ̆ 7 decision-making to be more consistent with Risk-Need-Responsivity practices, such <b>as</b> (<b>a)</b> making <b>service</b> <b>referrals</b> based on the fit between youths 2 ̆ 7 criminogenic needs and services, and (b) assigning levels of supervision based on youths 2 ̆ 7 level of risk. There was a shift in attention to more evidence-based dynamic risk factors. These changes occurred regardless of which RNA tool was used. Juvenile justice agencies are encouraged to adopt an evidence-based RNA tool using a sound implementation model in order to meet the objectives of the JJDPA and RNR practices. Benefits and barriers to adoption of RNA tools by juvenile probation departments are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved...|$|R
