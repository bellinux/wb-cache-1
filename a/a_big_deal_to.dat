Of the experience she said, I {{think a lot of}} females struggle with the way they look, and I wanted to show that everyone's body is different. I think it's <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E

Lind said that these sales were [...] "definitely <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> the band because it shows how the fanbase is growing.

500|$|Rhys has a {{one-night stand}} with Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) not long after his introduction. Rhys meets Kate in the local bar {{and they have a}} [...] "big night out"; the {{following}} morning Kate wakes up in Rhys' apartment. Brewer told a writer for Inside Soap [...] "You don't actually see the lead-up– one minute she meets Rhys in a bar, the next minute we see that they've already slept together!" [...] Kate feels awkward about the situation, but it is made worse when she is unable to remember Rhys' name. When Kate and Rhys meet again, they have different attitudes to their one-night stand. Brewer said Rhys is [...] "a bit of a player", so it is not <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> him. He does not have any expectations of Kate, but she is uncomfortable with it and tries to cover her tracks. In November 2011, Brewer said {{it would be interesting to}} revisit the relationship between Rhys and Kate. Barber also thought it would be interesting to see where the characters could go together. The actor added that [...] "sparks fly" [...] when Rhys is around Kate, as he knows how to [...] "press her buttons".|$|E

500|$|When Robbie {{first began}} filming, {{she was told}} that Donna was bisexual. Of this Robbie said, [...] "In one of the blocks she is talking to Bridget about their 'first time' and Donna asks Bridget if {{it was with a}} guy or girl? I liked the way the writers {{conveyed}} that, it was just really subtle and they didn't make a big coming out scene of it. I think it's a good message to send out because it's not such <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> lots of people. Not all of them have such drama surrounding it". Donna's first storyline that included this aspect of her character was a kiss between herself and fellow female character, Sunny Lee (Hany Lee). The kiss occurs after Donna discovers that Sunny has been writing the romantic love letters given to her by her boyfriend. Sunny is shocked when Donna leans over and kisses her on the lips, as it is her first kiss. The show's producers called the kiss between Sunny and Donna as [...] "impulsive" [...] and Robbie agreed saying [...] "It's really not a big deal at all. It's not an actual gay storyline, it's just kind of an impulsive peck". The storyline came weeks after rival soap Home and Away endured a backlash to its own same-sex romance.|$|E

5000|$|In September 2002, {{following}} a two-week investigation, Salon removed from its website an article authored by Leopold about Army Secretary Thomas E. White's {{role in the}} Enron collapse, due to questions {{about the validity of}} an e-mail and allegations that portions of the article had not been adequately credited to the Financial Times. The disputed e-mail was said to have been from White, telling the recipient <b>to</b> [...] "Close <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> hide the loss." [...] According to Salon, Leopold's article [...] "used seven full paragraphs amounting to 480 words, virtually verbatim, from the FT. There were two attributions to the FT within the passage, but they appeared to apply only to the specific sentences that contained them, not to the full passage." [...] Leopold later admitted that he had been careless by not providing the FT with additional credit, but insisted that Salons editors had all the relevant documents, including the disputed White email, before the story was published. Paul Krugman of the New York Times, who wrote a piece based in part on Leopold's work, also had to backpedal, acknowledging that he should not have cited the e-mail.|$|R

5000|$|Armah {{presents}} a very critical {{view of the}} character Sheldon Tubman.

5000|$|When {{you first}} saw her come in season 3, she didn’t really know {{who these people}} were. She finds this group of people and makes them her family immediately. And yes, she’s got what I think you could call anger issues. I wouldn’t say she’s gotten away from it. I think right now she’s gotten {{in touch with a}} lot of pain. I think she’s been sort of quote-unquote [...] "betrayed", or at least she thinks she’s been betrayed, by {{something}} that’s very close to her, which is her family, particularly her father. And it’s <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> her. Which would explain her love and relationship with somebody like Leroy Jethro Gibbs...The fact that she becomes a part of this team and the fact that she’s officially an NCIS agent—as opposed to a Mossad liaison officer—is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> her. But nothing really changes as far as the work. Hopefully things can begin to settle as far as her emotional stuff. Hopefully she can start to enjoy things a little bit more and maybe take a breather. But for a person like Ziva who’s been through so much, I feel like it’ll just take a little bit to adjust. In real life, a person that has gone through all that stuff, I don’t think it’s just from night to day. It’s just not gonna change that easily.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to the {{experimental}} match, the State of Origin concept was derided by the Sydney Media.

One member of the Sydney media who welcomed the game was Ray [...] "Rabbits" [...] Warren, who wrote in the Sunday Telegraph: [...] "I know a lot of people are upset at the go-ahead of the State of Origin game, but I congratulate those who pushed it through. Queensland and NSW Country areas need an injection of life and this match can do nothing but good for the game north of the border." ...|$|R

40|$|From the 17 th to the 19 th century, <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> was <b>to</b> prove Earth {{rotation}} existence. For this purpose, numerous experimental physicists from Borelli in 1668 to Reich in 1832 {{tried to}} measure an eastward deviation of a falling sphere. Reich performed 106 falling experiments on a 158. 5 m deep mine pit. The mean eastward deviation of its experiments is 2. 8 cm. This value corresponds exactly with the theoretical one predicted by Laplace and Gauss expression at Freiberg latitude where experiments were conducted. While Reich took extreme precautions to perform its experiments, the dispersion on its results is very important. Actually aerodynamic lift forces on a smooth sphere made its free fall non perfectly straight. We understand Reich's results dispersion considering fluctuating lift forces intensity on a smooth sphere at those Reynolds numbers (Re∼ 10 ^ 4 − 10 ^ 5). This study provides a criterion above {{which we can}} distinguish between lift force and Coriolis deviation during a free fall experiment. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that most high school girls are more {{interested}} in a relationship compared to high school boys, who are interested in mostly sex.

Another study shows that once a person has sex for their first time, it becomes less of <b>an</b> issue or <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> future relationships or hook ups. During this study, it was shown that girls in high school do not care as much as boys do on having sex in a relationship.
