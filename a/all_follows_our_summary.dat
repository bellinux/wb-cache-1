The aim {{of this study is to}} create scenarios on how new information systems for improved road traffic can evolve. What are the driving forces? Who can act? Who can benefit? What are the social impacts? Through the use of a Delphi panel of professionals, researchers and informed generalists, we have gathered impulses for the scenarios on how information technology, communication means and control systems can reshape future road traffic. The issue studied is how this "Road Transport Informatics" (RTI) will evolve. A short history of road information systems is given and the problem formulation and methodology is discussed. A summary of panelists' responses on events, impacts, actors and barriers <b>follows.</b> <b>Our</b> <b>summaries</b> and conclusions on a possible RTI evolution are presented as scenario scenes for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2010, 2020 and 2040...|$|R

We have also reviewed the spreadsheet and power point slides that were posted on the TMT web site for the regional forum. The conclusions of our review are summarized in the following points. A detailed discussion of each point <b>follows</b> <b>our</b> <b>summary</b> conclusions. Conclusions · The “Summer Spill ” analysis has been presented verbally, with power point slides. A spreadsheet was posted. However, BPA has not prepared a written document explaining the analysis, hypothesis, assumptions, parameters and most importantly how technical comments regarding the limitations of the SIMPAS model, previously distributed from the fishery agencies and tribes, have been addressed in this analysis. The agencies and tribes have requested a written manuscript of this analysis, complete with assumptions and supportive data based upon the scientific literature and reserve the right to provide additional comments when the written document is provided. · The “Summer Spill Analysis ” is an inappropriate application of the SIMPAS model. The agencies and tribes have advised the region on several occasions regarding the limitations of the simple spreadsheet SIMPAS model. (see attached correspondence, Appendix A). SIMPAS ignores uncertainty and risk, and does not provide confidence intervals for each model parameter. The NOAA Biological Opinion specifically discusses the limitations of SIMPAS as it pertains to prediction of adult returns and delayed mortality. The BPA impact analysis results utilizing SIMPAS are highly uncertain and do not provide a robust foundation for fish passage management decisions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA map is a cell {{decomposition}} of a closed surface; it is regular if its automorphism group acts transitively on the flags, mutually incident vertex-edge-face triples. The {{main purpose of}} this paper is to establish, by elementary methods, the following result: for each positive integer w and for each pair of integersp≥ 3 and q≥ 3 satisfying 1 /p+ 1 /q≤ 1 / 2, there is an orientable regular map with face-size p and valency q such that every non-contractible simple closed curve on the surface meets the 1 -skeleton of the map in at least w points. This result has several interesting consequences concerning maps on surfaces, graphs and related concepts.

In this paper, we tackle the controversial issue of {{how it can be}} differentiated from other forms of OR. While it has been persuasively argued that Community OR cannot be defined by its clients, practitioners or methods, we argue that the common concern of all Community OR practice is the meaningful engagement of communities, whatever form that may take - and the legitimacy of different forms of engagement may be open to debate. We then move on to discuss four other controversies that have implications for the future development of Community OR and its relationship with its parent discipline: the desire for Community OR to be more explicitly political; claims that it should be grounded in the theory, methodology and practice of systems thinking; the similarities and differences between the UK and US traditions; {{and the extent to which}} Community OR offers an enhanced understanding of practice that could be useful to OR more generally.

We examine the properties of return ratio series of selected components in FTSE 100 index, adopt the Kendall’s (rank correlation coefficient between series to write adjacency matrices and transform these matrices into complex networks.

40|$|Vertical {{transmission}} (VT) {{and associated}} manipulation of host reproduction are widely reported among prokaryotic endosymbionts. Here, we present evidence for {{widespread use of}} VT and associated sex-ratio distortion in a eukaryotic phylum. The Microspora are an unusual and diverse group of eukaryotic parasites that infect <b>all</b> animal phyla. <b>Following</b> <b>our</b> initial description of a microsporidian that feminizes its crustacean host, we survey the diversity and distribution of VT within the Microspora. We find that vertically transmitted microsporidia are ubiquitous in the amphipod hosts sampled {{and that they are}} also diverse, with 11 species of microsporidia detected within 16 host species. We found that infections were more common in females than males, suggesting that host sex-ratio distortion occurs in five out of eight parasite species tested. Phylogenetic reconstruction demonstrates that VT occurs in all major lineages of the phylum Microspora and that sex-ratio distorters are found on multiple branches of the phylogenetic tree. We propose that VT is either an ancestral trait or evolves with peculiar frequency in this phylum. If the association observed here between VT and host sex-ratio distortion holds true across other host taxa, these eukaryotic parasites may join the bacterial endosymbionts in their importance as sex-ratio distorters...|$|R

40|$|Multimedia {{data are}} {{characterized}} by large, complex values with temporal dependencies. Such data are used by distributed multimedia applications offering long-lived multimedia presentations in distributed environments. An end-client may choose to specify quality requirements for a multimedia presentation, using quality of service (QoS) parameters known from traditional communication technology. The client's demands and requirements should be satisfied throughout the entire presentation, thus QoS management is required. These management tasks may be performed by software components residing at each functional component in a distributed multimedia system, for example the network or database system. We refer to such a software component as a QoS manager, who, among other things, is responsible for adjusting the level of QoS prior to and during a multimedia presentation. Whenever the user's requirements regarding QoS are not satisfied, the adaptation mechanism is responsible for bringing the QoS level within the accepted boundaries. We focus on adaptation mechanisms for QoS in a multimedia database management system (MMDBMS) offering services to applications for distance learning called Learning-on-Demand (LoD). LoD offers interactive services and {{a high degree of}} user interactions. In the OMODIS (Object-Oriented Modeling and Database Support for Distributed Multimedia Systems) project at the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo, a framework for QoS management has been developed. The framework defines messages for interaction between QoS managers in a dynamic, reconfigurable QoS management hierarchy. Each manager consists of 7 internal agents, one being a QoS adaptation agent. In our work we propose messages for interaction inside a QoS manager connected to a MMDBMS and a QoS management hierarchy. To decide the tasks of a manager for a MMDBMS we identify a set of events that may occur in a MMDBMS supporting LoD applications. These events are used to design protocols for internal communication between the agents of a QoS manager for a MMDBMS. The internal messages are realized through formal specifications in Promela (protocol meta language). The formal specifications are used to simulate and validate the behavior of the internal message passing. Simulations and conformance testing are used to show that the protocols as specified, are correct with respect to a set of correctness criteria, and that the protocols support the agents in performing their QoS management tasks. Temporal claims and correctness requirements are used during validation. The validation results show that the protocols for internal communication meet all correctness criteria. In particular, the protocols are free of deadlocks and livelocks. All protocol executions end in legal end states, and they <b>all</b> <b>follow</b> <b>our</b> definition of legal sessions in respect to the session states defined in the OMODIS QoS framework. In addition, we propose an adaptation model for the QoS adaptation agent of the QoS manager. The model defines behavior for local QoS adaptation prior to and during a presentation. Our adaptation model is based on QoS monitoring results of the local component. Thus, it is capable of discovering QoS violations caused by the MMDBMS at an earlier stage than adaptation models depending exclusively upon monitoring results from the client side. Problems at the client side will not arise until an end-to-end QoS violation has occurred...|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} {{participation}}, {{we found that}} our participation data were comparable to prior research using physics RBAs across several dimensions, including genders and grades. We found that when faculty do little to motivate students to complete online low-stakes assessments, students are {{much less likely to}} participate than they are on in-class assessments. Our models show that if faculty <b>follow</b> <b>all</b> of <b>our</b> recommended practices, reminding students in class and online to participate and offering credit for participation, student participation rates for CBT posttests match those for PPT posttests. We focus on the posttests rather than the pretests because the participation rates are lowest on the posttest and they contain important information about the effects of the course. Our findings align with prior research into student participation on other online surveys, such as end-of-course evaluations. These findings indicate that, with intention, faculty can save class time by transferring their low-stakes RBA administrations from in-class PPTs to out-of-class CBTs without lowering their student participation rates.|$|R
