These mixes promote faster root growth and give quick anchorage to young roots. The mixture helps retain <b>air,</b> <b>plant</b> food, and moisture, releasing them as the plant requires them. These mixes were pioneered by Boodley and Sheldrake. Exfoliated vermiculite is also used as a growing media for hydroponics.|$|E

There was a conditioning building (K-1401), where piping and equipment were cleaned prior to installation. A feed purification building (K-101), was built to remove impurities from the uranium hexafluoride, but never operated as such because the suppliers provided feed good enough to be fed into the gaseous diffusion process. The three-storey surge and waste removal building (K-601) processed the [...] "tail" [...] stream of depleted uranium hexafluoride. The air conditioning building (K-1401) provided not cool air, but [...] per minute of clean, dry air. The compressed <b>air</b> <b>plant</b> (K-1201) contained compressors. The nitrogen plant (K-1408) provided nitrogen gas that was used as a pump sealant and to protect equipment from moist air.|$|E
