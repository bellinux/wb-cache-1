500|$|Critics {{interpret}} the Jake–Brett relationship in various ways. [...] Daiker suggests that Brett's behavior in Madrid—after Romero leaves and when Jake arrives at her summons—reflects her immorality. Scott Donaldson thinks Hemingway presents the Jake–Brett relationship {{in such a}} manner that Jake knew [...] "that in having Brett for a friend 'he had been getting something for nothing' and that sooner or later he would have to pay the bill." [...] Daiker notes that Brett relies on Jake to pay for her train fare from Madrid to San Sebastián, where she rejoins her fiancé Mike. In a piece Hemingway cut, he has Jake thinking, [...] "you learned <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> woman by not sleeping with her." [...] By the end of the novel, although Jake loves Brett, he appears to undergo a transformation in Madrid when he begins to distance himself from her. Reynolds believes that Jake represents the [...] "everyman," [...] and that {{in the course of the}} narrative he loses his honor, faith, and hope. He sees the novel as a morality play with Jake as the person who loses the most.|$|E

How powerfully the humble mismatched shoes stand for the presence of persons whose dignity and humanity have been erased. But a shoe produced and worn at a specific time also embodies the values, ideals and aesthetic choices of an era. Shoes can tell us <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> individual, but they also convey messages that are understood across society: high heels stand for an exaggerated femininity; red shoes for pleasure and desire; and sneakers for modern pace in the city, leisure and relaxation. The story of shoes in the longue durée is characterized by themes of morality, mobility and extremism as we shall see...|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} of the limbs with the substrate can teach <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> animal's gait mechanics. Unlike ground-reaction forces, plantar pressure distributions are rarely studied in animals, but they may provide more detailed information about the loading patterns and locomotor function of specific anatomical structures. With this study, we aim to describe pressures for a large and diverse sample of mammalian species, focusing on scaling effects. We collected dynamic plantar pressure distributions during voluntary walking in 28 mammal species. A dynamic classification of foot use was made, which distinguished between plantiportal, digitiportal and unguliportal animals. Analysis focused on scaling effects of peak pressures, peak forces and foot contact areas. Peak pressure for the complete mammal sample was found to scale to (mass) 1 / 2, higher than predicted assuming geometric similarity, and we found {{no difference between the}} different types of foot use. Only the scaling of peak force is dependent on the dynamic foot use. We conclude that plantar peak pressure rises faster with mass than expected, regardless of the type of foot use, and scales higher than in limb bones. These results might explain some anatomical and behavioural adaptations in graviportal animals...|$|R

50|$|Handspinners use {{the number}} of twists per inch often. Because the amount of twist defines <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> yarn, {{the number of}} twists per inch is an {{important}} measure to recreate a yarn.

Measuring the number of twists per inch while spinning singles also helps the spinner create a balanced yarn when plying. Yarns that have relatively few twists per inch tend to have a softer hand but are not as strong as yarns with more twists per inch, such as medium twist or hard twist yarns. Yarns that have a very hard twist, enough so that the yarn will double back onto itself when released from tension, are called crepe-twist yarns.|$|E
