The main sources of funds came from issuing government bonds to the state bank and sales of public lands.

5|$|In December 1999, President Fernando de la Rúa took office, seeking {{assistance}} from the IMF shortly thereafter. In March 2000, the IMF agreed to a three-year $7.2 billion stand-by arrangement with Argentina, conditioned on a strict fiscal adjustment and the assumption of 3.5% GDP growth in 2000 (actual growth was 0.5%). In late 2000, Argentina began to experience severely diminished <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>capital</b> markets, as reflected in a sharp and sustained rise in spreads on Argentine bonds over U.S. Treasuries. In December, The de la Rua government announced a $40 billion multilateral assistance package organized by IMF. The uneven implementation of fiscal adjustments and reforms, a worsening global macroeconomic environment, and political instability led to {{the complete loss of}} market access and intensified capital flight by the second quarter of 2001. Argentine debt, held mostly in bonds, was massively sold short and the government found itself unable to borrow or meet debt payments.|$|E

In <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>capitals,</b> politics and power relations play a role. As such, ‘a livelihood is organized in arenas of conflicting [and] co-operating actors’ (De Haan and Zoomers [2005], p. 34). Yet, politics have been overlooked in livelihood studies (Scoones [2009]). Politics relate to how macro policies (e.g. neoliberal globalization in Mexico) and power relations among actors affect the <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>capitals.</b> In the Mexican rural context, different actors often collide and intertwine (Long [1998]). Drawing on these concepts, we postulate that goat husbandry is a livelihood strategy adapted historically to its specific context and that goat-keeping households employ a range of <b>capitals,</b> the <b>access</b> <b>to</b> which {{is influenced by the}} context. This refers to the institutional and political context in which goat husbandry is embedded, such as the agroecology and everyday relations of farmers among themselves and with other actors.|$|R

Using data from NELLS, a nationally representative survey of the Dutch population aged 15 - 45 years, results show that within this age group <b>access</b> <b>to</b> social <b>capital</b> increases with age and educational qualifications, and is lower among women. Residing in a less affluent neighbourhood and scoring lower on a measurement for cognitive abilities are associated with less social capital.

The results presented above indicate that this immigrant optimism might be better understood as reflecting unequal <b>access</b> <b>to</b> social <b>capital.</b> Based on earlier research I have argued that different <b>access</b> <b>to</b> social <b>capital</b> between immigrants and non-immigrants likely depend on two factors: that social networks are not declassed in migration {{in the same way as}} occupational positions are; and that ethnicized social exclusion makes it more difficult to enter new social relations with members of the majority.

Rather than rely on traditional elements of America’s security advantage – including US-led alliances such as NATO and multi-lateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund – Bremmer argues that the US is now ‘weaponizing finance’ by limiting access to the American marketplace and to US banks as an instrument of its foreign and security policy.|$|E

Using two nationally representative datasets, the authors' analyses revealed that <b>access</b> <b>to</b> social <b>capital</b> {{defined in terms of}} membership of social organisations positively affects household income and reduces poverty. Education was the key determinant of income and increases the probability of joining social networks. Their results further show that household income and welfare are positively associated with <b>access</b> <b>to</b> social <b>capital</b> or group participation. This suggests that government strategies to increase household income that take into consideration existing social institutions {{will go a long way}} to encourage associational growth and performance and consequently reduce poverty. poverty, social capital, rural, Uganda, Africa,...|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} give all {{employees}} the same access to decision-making, the basic organisations of associated labor were also applied to public services, including health and education. The basic organizations were usually made up {{of no more than}} a few dozen people and had their own workers' councils, whose assent was needed for strategic decisions and appointment of managers in enterprises or public institutions. The results of these reforms however were not satisfactory. There have been rampant wage-price inflations, substantial rundown of capital plant and consumer shortages, while the income gap between the poorer southern and the relatively affluent northern regions was unchanged. The self-management system stimulated the inflationary economy that was needed to support it. Large state-owned enterprises operated as monopolists with unrestricted <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>capital</b> that was shared according to political criteria. Oil crisis of 1973 magnified the economic problems, which the government tried to solve with extensive foreign borrowing. Although such actions resulted in a reasonable rate of growth for a few years (GNP grew at 5.1% yearly), such growth was unsustainable since the rate of foreign borrowing grew at an annual rate of 20%.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Social {{capital has}} been {{recognized}} as one important social determinant for health, {{but we still have}} limited knowledge about how {{it can be used to}} explain inequality in health. This study investigated the links between individual social capital and self-rated health by gender and educational level, and analyzed if <b>access</b> <b>to</b> social <b>capital</b> might explain the observed disparities in self-rated health between men and women and different educational groups. Study design: A cross-sectional survey in Northern Sweden. Methods: A social capital questionnaire was constructed and mailed to 15 000 randomly selected individuals. Different forms of structural and cognitive social capital were measured. Self-rated health was used as the outcome measure. Crude and adjusted OR and 95 % CI were calculated for good selfrated health and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> each form of social capital. Multivariate regression was used to analyze how sociodemographic factors and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> social <b>capital</b> might influence differences in self-rated health by gender and educational level. Results: <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> almost each form of social capital significantly increased the odds for good self-rated health for all groups. A higher education significantly increased the odds for <b>access</b> <b>to</b> each form of social capital, and being a man significantly increased the odds for having <b>access</b> <b>to</b> some forms of social capital. The health advantage for higher educated and men partly decreased when controlling for <b>access</b> <b>to</b> social <b>capital.</b> Conclusions: <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> social <b>capital</b> can partly explain the observed health inequality between men and women and different educational groups. Strengthening social capital might be one way of tackling health inequality. It is important to consider the structural conditions that create unequal opportunities for different groups <b>to</b> <b>access</b> social <b>capital...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The coastal {{provinces of}} Holland and Zeeland had for centuries prior to Spanish rule been {{important}} hubs of the European maritime trade network. Their geographical location provided convenient {{access to the}} markets of France, Scotland, Germany, England and the Baltic. The war with Spain led many financiers and traders to emigrate from Antwerp, a major city in Flanders {{and then one of}} Europe's most important commercial centres, to Dutch cities, particularly Amsterdam, which became Europe's foremost centre for shipping, banking, and insurance. Efficient <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>capital</b> enabled the Dutch in the 1580s to extend their trade routes beyond northern Europe to new markets in the Mediterranean and the Levant. In the 1590s, Dutch ships began to trade with Brazil and the Dutch Gold Coast of Africa, and towards the Indian Ocean and the source of the lucrative spice trade. This brought the Dutch into direct competition with Portugal, which had dominated these trade routes for several decades, and had established colonial outposts on the coasts of Brazil, Africa and the Indian Ocean to facilitate them. The rivalry with Portugal, however, was not entirely economic: from 1580, after the death of the King of Portugal, Sebastian I, and much of the Portuguese nobility in the Battle of Alcácer Quibir, the Portuguese crown had been joined to that of Spain in an [...] "Iberian Union" [...] under the heir of Emperor Charles V, Philip II of Spain. By attacking Portuguese overseas possessions, the Dutch forced Spain to divert financial and military resources away from its attempt to quell Dutch independence.
