5|$|Although {{there are}} many diverse pathogens, {{many of which are}} {{constantly}} mutating, it is <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> a majority of individuals remain free of infections. Thus, maintenance of health requires the body to recognize all pathogens (antigens they present or produce) likely to exist. This is achieved by maintaining a pool of immensely large (about 109) clones of B cells, each of which reacts against a specific epitope by recognizing and producing antibodies against it. However, at any given time very few clones actually remain receptive to their specific epitope. Thus, approximately 107 different epitopes can be recognized by all the B cell clones combined. Moreover, in a lifetime, an individual usually requires the generation of antibodies against very few antigens in comparison with the number that the body can recognize and respond against.|$|E
5|$|Initially Guerrero worked lower card matches, in the first-to-third {{match on}} the show with some success. On September 11, 1998 he {{defeated}} Mr. Águila in his first ever Lucha de Apuestas match, forcing his opponent to unmask and reveal his real name {{as part of the}} CMLL 65th Anniversary Show. Mr. Águila already worked for the World Wrestling Federation without his mask, so it was not seen as <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> he lost to Guerrero. In 1999 Último Guerrero teamed up with veteran Blue Panther to win the Gran Alternativa ("Grea Alternative") tournament, a tournament where a young wrestler teams with a veteran. Winning the Gran Alternativa tournament is often a sign that the promotion has plans to move a wrestler up the rankings. Shortly after winning the tournament, Guerrero won a match that made him the number one contender for Great Sasuke's NWA World Middleweight Championship. Último Guerrero did not win the match but the fact that he worked a featured match in CMLL's main arena, Arena México, showed that the company had plans for him.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the early}} Norman castles were built from timber, {{but by the end}} of the 11thcentury a few, {{including}} the Tower of London, had been renovated or replaced with stone. Work on the White Tower– which gives the whole castle its name– is usually considered to have begun in 1078, however the exact date is uncertain. William made Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, responsible for its construction, although it may not have been completed until after William's death in 1087. The White Tower is the earliest stone keep in England, and was the strongest point {{of the early}} castle. It also contained grand accommodation for the king. At the latest, it was probably finished by 1100 when Bishop Ranulf Flambard was imprisoned there. Flambard was loathed by the English for exacting harsh taxes. Although he is the first recorded prisoner held in the Tower, he was also the first person to escape from it, using a smuggled rope secreted in a butt of wine. He was held in luxury and permitted servants, but on 2 February 1101 he hosted a banquet for his captors. After plying them with drink, when no one was looking he lowered himself from a secluded chamber, and out of the Tower. The escape came as such <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> one contemporary chronicler accused the bishop of witchcraft.|$|E
40|$|The students’ {{argument}} against the possibility of <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> exam assumes <b>that</b> the following would not occur: the teacher decides to give the exam on a certain day; the teacher believes that the exam would be <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> on <b>that</b> day; but, actually, the exam would not be <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> on <b>that</b> day. I give a reason to reject this assumption, and I point out that an attempt to reformulate the surprise exam paradox {{in order to allow}} for the assumption does not result in an acceptable argument...|$|R

25|$|His {{success with}} {{assistant}} manager Tom Chadney {{by his side}} {{attracted the attention of}} much larger clubs, and Eriksson was appointed manager of IFK Göteborg on 1 January 1979.

25|$|In February 1982, after Glenn Shorrock had {{departed}} Little River Band, Farnham became their lead vocalist with recommendations by Goble and Wheatley. Farnham had initially resisted {{the idea of}} joining LRB but Wheatley convinced him that Shorrock approved of the replacement. This continued Farnham's move away from cabaret and into rock music. As Little River Band was a successful band prior to Farnham joining, it was <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> they found little initial success.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 it was <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> {{such people}} as Bujak and Borusewicz instead of calling a National Commission {{nominated}} themselves.

25|$|Under {{standard}} conditions, from CH4 to C4H10 alkanes are gaseous; from C5H12 to C17H36 {{they are}} liquids; and after C18H38 they are solids. As {{the boiling point}} of alkanes is primarily determined by weight, {{it should not be}} <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> the boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size (molecular weight) of the molecule. As a rule of thumb, the boiling point rises 20–30°C for each carbon added to the chain; this rule applies to other homologous series.|$|E
25|$|Aleppo is {{considered}} one of the main centres of Arabic traditional and classic music with the famous Aleppine Muwashshahs, Qudud Halabiya and Maqams (religious, secular and folk poetic-musical genres). Aleppines in general are fond of Arab classical music, the Tarab, and it is not <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> many artists from Aleppo are considered pioneers among the Arabs in classic and traditional music. The most prominent figures in this field are Sabri Mdallal, Sabah Fakhri, Shadi Jamil, Abed Azrie and Nour Mhanna. Many iconic artists of the Arab music like Sayed Darwish and Mohammed Abdel Wahab were visiting Aleppo to recognize the legacy of Aleppine art and learn from its cultural heritage.|$|E
25|$|Between 1990 and 1994, the ANC began {{preparing}} for the first democratic elections. It was an adjustment period and Mbeki {{played a crucial role}} in transforming the ANC into a legal political organisation. In 1991, the ANC was able to hold its first legal conference in the country after 30 years of being banned. The party now had the task of finding a middle ground for discussion between all the various factions: the returning exiles, the long-term prisoners and those who had stayed behind to lead the struggle. Mbeki was chosen as national chair while Cyril Ramaphosa was elected secretary general and the ANC's chief negotiator at the multiparty talks. Mbeki had up to this point been handling much of the diplomatic talks with the apartheid regime, and given his diplomatic experience and the level of bargaining that was expected, it came as <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> Mbeki was sidelined in favour of Ramaphosa.|$|E

25|$|Mauricio Soler came {{free from}} the peloton before the first climb {{of the day and}} took full points {{available}} to him, taking the lead outright in the King of the Mountains from Rasmussen. He and Carlos Sastre, for whom it was something of <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> he was able {{to get away from the}} peloton easily as he was 5th in the GC at the beginning of the day, worked together to stay away as long as possible. They wound up being caught with 11 kilometers left to race by a group containing Rasmussen, Alberto Contador, Levi Leipheimer, and numerous domestiques from their teams. Rasmussen came clear of this group on the way up the Aubisque to win the stage. It was thought at the time that this all but cinched his victory in the Tour, since only flat stages and an individual time trial remained, and that even a relatively weak time trialist like Rasmussen was unlikely to lose three to five minutes.|$|E
25|$|Greenhough first {{played for}} Lancashire {{as early as}} 1951, after coming from the League club Fieldhouse, but until 1956 he played very little for the first eleven. That season, however, he took 66 wickets for less than {{eighteen}} runs apiece, and formed a remarkable trio of spinners with Roy Tattersall and Malcolm Hilton. In 1957, however, Greenhough seemed to lack spin and in 1958 played only eight games out of twenty eight for the first eleven. It was thus <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that,</b> in the dry summer of 1959, Greenhough was able to not only displace both Tattersall and Hilton, but even leap into the Test side against India. Although he did well even when India's lack of batting prowess was taken into account, Greenhough was soon reported for persistently running down the pitch during his follow-through. Once Greenhough corrected this problem he bowled as well as before. Greenhough's record of 93 wickets in eighteen county games suggested that, had he not missed five games correcting his run-up, he would probably have taken around 150 wickets, which would have made him the leading wicket-taker in England.|$|E
500|$|On February 3, 2005, Bethesda {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with Take-Two Interactive regarding the publication and release of Oblivion. Under the agreement, Bethesda would retain full control over Oblivions development and the rights to any possible sequels, and Take-Two would agree to publish the game under its recently formed 2K Games sub brand. According to Producer Gavin Carter, the team's experience was a rarity in the industry; few independent developer-publisher relationships still exist, and it was <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> Bethesda's experience worked out {{as well as it}} did. Carter described Take-Two's role as one of minimal interference, and the company mostly left Bethesda's development teams alone, trusting them to produce a [...] "fantastic product" [...] with minimal interference or [...] "red tape". The relationship was a rarity in the industry, according to Carter, where most developers are beholden to their publishers. [...] Ashley Cheng, Oblivions senior producer, concurred. There was [...] "complete freedom" [...] at Bethesda to decide their own path, whatever market trends might say. Of the legal proceedings affecting Bethesda's parent company ZeniMax during the initial stages of game development, when Bethesda founder Christopher Weaver sued the company for severance pay, Todd Howard said that he, as a producer, wasn't involved with corporate affairs. [...] "I just focus on the games." ...|$|E

[...] Joanne Dorken of MTV UK was also positive, praising the song's [...] "simple backing music, and Beyoncé's flawless and beautiful voice." [...] She concluded that [...] "I Was Here" [...] ends up being a [...] "standout song on the album [...] we won't be forgetting Queen B in a hurry." [...] Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic was also positive, writing, [...] "Payoff comes on 11th song, the epically loping 'I Was Here.' Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun commented that [...] "I Was Here" [...] comes to [...] "a show-stopping moment in a Beyonce concert near you". James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that the collaboration of Diane Warren and Ryan Tedder, introduces [...] "a new strain of her balladry: an ethereal marriage of R sensuality and stuttering indie-rock guitars." [...] Condar Tao of the website Sputnikmusic showed his {{appreciation for}} the song, writing, [...] " [...] perhaps even more notable is the record's penultimate track, the Ryan Tedder-produced 'I Was Here'. Tedder is arguably {{one of the most}} irritating people working in pop today, and considering his track record, it's not <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> 'I Was Here' is the most contemporary-sounding song off of 4. What is surprising is just how good it is. The production is predictably icky, making that increasingly common mistake of using distant footsteps and reverbed guitar to convey a clichéd sense of 'epicness'." [...] Gary Graff of Billboard said that the line [...] "I want to leave my footprints on the sands of time" [...] in the song defined the whole album. Simon Goddard of Q magazine chose [...] "I Was Here" [...] {{as one of the best}} songs on 4, describing it as a [...] "breast-clutching tour de fource".|$|E
