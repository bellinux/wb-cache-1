5|$|The Principal acts as {{the chief}} {{executive}} officer of the university under the authority of the Board and the Senate, and supervises <b>and</b> <b>directs</b> the academic and administrative work of the university and of its teaching and non-teaching staff. Since 1974, principals have been appointed for five-year terms, renewable subject to review.

Daniel Woolf has served as the twentieth principal, serving since 1 September 2009. The office of the vice-chancellor has typically been held by the incumbent principal. In 1961, an amendment was secured by the Board to separate the office of principal from vice-chancellor if it wished.

5|$|The {{occurrence}} of Boletopsis nothofagi {{seems to be}} strongly connected to the {{occurrence of}} the southern beech Nothofagus fusca, a species of Fagales that is endemic to New Zealand. B.nothofagi has been found exclusively in N.fusca forests spread through New Zealand below 37° S. The fungus forms a mycorrhizal association with the trees of N.fusca, in which the hyphae of the fungal mycelium wrap around {{the roots of the}} tree and penetrate the cortex, but not its cells. Subsequently, B.nothofagi takes over the function of the root hair <b>and</b> <b>directs</b> water and soil nutrients to the tree. In return, the fungus can, through contact with the root tissue, access the products of the tree's photosynthesis. The fruit bodies of the species have so far always been found in May, the end of autumn in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
