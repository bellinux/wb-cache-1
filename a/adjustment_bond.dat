40|$|We {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} of a link between exchange rate policy and sovereign bonds. We analyze the effect of exchange rate policies on supply and credit spreads of sovereign bonds issued by developing countries. An exchange rate policy is captured by the de facto exchange rate regime and the real exchange rate misalignment. The main findings are: (1) real exchange rate overvaluation significantly increases sovereign bond issue probability and raises bond spreads; (2) spreads {{and the likelihood of}} issuing bonds depend on the exchange rate regime; (3) exchange rate misalignment under a hard peg significantly increases bond spreads; (4) in time of debt crises, exchange rate policy also greatly affects the sovereign bond market, especially through exchange rate overvaluation.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{fiscal policy}} {{in a model}} of sovereign risk spreads ("spreads"). Using panel data from emerging market countries, we find that reductions in public expenditure are a more powerful tool for reducing spreads than increases in revenues. Specifically, cuts in current spending lower spreads by more than cuts in investment spending, and they also lower spreads by more than increases in revenue. We also show that debt-financed current spending increases sovereign risk by more than tax-financed current spending, suggesting that international investors have some preference for the latter. In line with the empirical literature on the determinants of spreads, we find that liquidity and solvency indicators, as well as macroeconomic fundamentals, are also important determinants of spreads.

Building on our earlier systematic <b>adjustment</b> of <b>bond</b> valence (BV) parameters to the bond softness, here we discuss how the squared BV mismatch can be linked to the absolute energy scale and used as a general Morse-type interaction potential for analyzing low-energy pathways in ion conducting solid or mixed conductors either by an energy landscape approach or by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For a wide range of Lithium oxides we could thus model ion transport revealing significant differences to an earlier geometric approach. Our novel BV-based force-field has also been applied to investigate a range of mixed conductors, focusing on cathode materials for lithium ion battery (LIB) applications to promote a systematic design of LIB cathodes that combine high energy density with high power density.

40|$|Despite {{the rise}} in public debt, Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields have {{remained}} low and stable, supported by steady inflows from the household and corporate sectors, high domestic ownership of JGBs, and safe-haven flows from heightened sovereign risks in Europe. Over time, however, the market''s capacity to absorb new debt will likely shrink as population ages and risk appetite recovers. In the short term, a decline in fund supply from the corporate sector, where financial surpluses are abnormally high, and spillovers from global financial distress could push up JGB yields.

Projection from hypercomplex algebra to real algebra necessitates the three-dimensional definition of concepts such as chirality, quantum uncertainty and probability density to compensate for errors of abstraction. The emergent alternative description of extranuclear charge density as spherical standing waves, optimized by a golden spiral, reveals atomic structure {{in line with the}} periodic table of the elements and underpinning the concepts of bond order, interatomic distance and stretching force constant, related to chemical interaction. The principles giving rise to molecular structure are shown to depend, like bond order, on the constructive interference of atomic wave fields, optimized by minimal <b>adjustment</b> to <b>bond</b> orders. The procedure is shown to be equivalent to the philosophy of molecular mechanics. Arguments based on the traditional interpretation of electronegativity, are presented to relate the parameters of strain-free bond lengths, dissociation energies and harmonic force constants, used in molecular mechanics, to quantum-mechanically defined ionization radii of atoms. Atomic electron densities and a bond-order function, both obtained by number-theory optimization, enable the direct calculation of interatomic distance, dissociation energy and stretching force constant for all pairwise interactions of any order. Torsional interaction determines the final shape of a molecule and presumably can only be understood as a four-dimensional effect. [URL]...|$|R

There were two distinct groups in terms of the speed of capital account liberalization: rapid liberalizers and cautious liberalizers. The speed of disinflation and the level of public debt were major determinants of the size of interest-rate-sensitive portfolio inflows.

40|$|The recent sharp {{increase}} in fiscal deficits and government debt in many countries raises questions regarding their impact on long-term sovereign bond yields. While economic theory suggests that this impact {{is likely to be}} adverse, empirical results have been less clear cut, have generally ignored nonlinear effects of deficits and debt through some other key determinants of yields, and have been mostly confined to advanced economies. This paper reexamines the impact of fiscal deficits and public debt on long-term interest rates during 1980 - 2008, taking into account a wide range of country-specific factors, for a panel of 31 advanced and emerging market economies. It finds that higher deficits and public debt lead to a significant increase in long-term interest rates, with the precise magnitude dependent on initial fiscal, institutional and other structural conditions, as well as spillovers from global financial markets. Taking into account these factors suggests that large fiscal deficits and public debts are likely to put substantial upward pressures on sovereign bond yields in many advanced economies over the medium term.

Performing a multiallelic analysis across OXTR by calculating a cumulative genetic risk score revealed a significant gene-by-environment () interaction, with OXTR genetic risk score interacting with adult separation anxiety to modulate levels of maternal sensitivity.

As a result, the model is able to generate a non-zero demand for bonds of different maturities, which become imperfect substitutes, due to differential liquidity conditions. The main properties of the model are analysed through both simulation and estimation exercises. The importance of the results are twofold. On one hand, the calibrated model is able to replicate the stylized facts regarding the yield curve and the term premium in the US over the period 1987 : 3 - 2011 : 3, without compromising its ability to match macro dynamics.

The association between subculture affiliation and substance use (smoking, drinking alcohol, drunkenness, and cannabis use) was adjusted for parental monitoring, parental bonding and parental substance abstinence for boys and girls separately using logistic regression. Adolescents affiliated to one of the selected youth subcultures were significantly more likely to use substances than other 15 -years-olds, except for cannabis use in girls. Adjustment for parental monitoring reduced the association between subculture affiliation and substance use by 31 - 64 % in girls and by 10 - 23 % in boys. <b>Adjustment</b> for parental <b>bonding</b> and parental substance abstinence led to no changes or minor changes. After adjustments for protective factors, subculture affiliation remained significantly associated with substance use. The role of protective factors in adolescents with a subculture affiliation regarding substance use is rather limited.

Through CRA 2 ̆ 7 s monitoring role, bonds no longer represent loan contracts without monitoring. In the model, bond issuers {{have to decide whether}} to go through CRA or borrow directly, and whether to take action to prevent future risk or not. CRA 2 ̆ 7 s monitoring ability is shown to be crucial. If CRA can observe creditworthiness changes more accurately so as to offer ratings with less noise, there will be more issuers willing to signal their qualities and take action. If CRA can attract issuers to take action but cannot function in its monitoring role well enough, social welfare will be reduced after introducing CRA into the market.;This paper then examines price <b>adjustments</b> in <b>bond</b> and equity markets according to Moody 2 ̆ 7 s bond rating watchlist announcements and actual rating change announcements afterwards. Based on different methods of calculating excess returns, we find that asset prices react in response to Moody 2 ̆ 7 s rating announcements, suggesting that they convey valuable information to both bond and equity markets and investors adjust prices according to both upgrading and downgrading directions. When we control for bond rating grades, the evidence of market reactions is more significant than without the control; in contrast, controlling for a stock 2 ̆ 7 s beta is not so beneficial. Stronger evidence of market reactions is found in bond markets than in equity markets.;Lastly, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) with fixed and mixed effects are applied to describe how an issuer matches with an underwriter for an initial public offering (IPO). The study focuses on the issuer 2 ̆ 7 s preference over underwriter reputation. From GLM with fixed effects, we find that the issuer tends to choose a high-reputation underwriter when the IPO 2 ̆ 7 s expected offer size is large, the expected offer price is high, the issuer is a young firm, there is venture capital backing, the issuer has more assets, or the issuer 2 ̆ 7 s leverage ratio is small. From the random effect in GLM with mixed effects, we find that issuers in the state of California or in the Service and Utility industries are more likely to choose high-reputation underwriters than issuers in other states or industries. Underwriters with high reputation tend to have larger sales forces and have headquarters in New York. Using propensity score matching methods, we find that underwriters with high reputation are generally associated with larger underpricings. The subsamples by the location of offer price in the filing range confirm such positive relation. However, evidence from subperiods shows that the larger underpricing is likely to be both an issuer 2 ̆ 7 s industry effect and an underwriter 2 ̆ 7 s reputation effect...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} ten years, the {{increasing}} price of gold has motivated the wire bonding industry to look for alternative bonding wire materials {{in the field of}} microelectronics packaging. A new candidate wire to replace gold is palladium coated silver wire. In this thesis, the effect of the two specific process parameters “bond stress” and “process temperature” on the ball bonds made with the new candidate wire are investigated. Using 20 μm diameter wire and various level-combinations of these process parameter, ball bonds are produced according to a special accelerated optimization method to result in a target diameter of 46 ± 0. 5 μm and target height of 16 ± 0. 5 μm. Three different levels are used for each of the specific process parameters. After pre-selecting a few process parameters, the accelerated method determines the levels for the process parameters “impact force” and “electric flame-off current” with a 2 × 2 design of experiments. Then, the ultrasound parameter is maximized up to a level where a pre-selected ultrasonic deformation occurs to the bonds, maintaining the target bond diameter and height. The bond quality is measured by measuring the shear strength of the bonds. The results show that • the bond geometry is not affected by the bond stress, • the optimized specific process parameters vary by less than ~ 0. 5 % when bond stress values are varied from 60 to 100 MPa, • the variations in optimized parameters are larger than ~ 3. 0 % when the BT is changed from 100 to 200 ºC, • ball bonds achieve acceptable shear strength (> 120 MPa) when the values for both, bond stress and bond temperature, are high, • ultrasound level and shear stress interact, the higher shear stress the lower the ultrasound level required. An average shear strength of ~ 120 MPa is achieved with 11. 4 % ultrasound, 100 MPa bond stress, and 200 ºC bond process temperature. In summary, a robust methodology is presented in this thesis to efficiently optimize the ball bonding process as demonstrated with the new candidate wire has a bondability similar to that of gold wire with only minor <b>adjustment</b> in the <b>bonding</b> process needed...|$|R
40|$|Two current {{theories}} [11, 17] of interfacial debonding and fibre pull-out, {{which have}} been developed {{on the basis of}} fracture mechanics and shear strength criteria, respectively, are critically compared with experimental results of several composite systems. From the plots of partial debond stress, sigma(d) p as a function of debond length, three different cases of the interfacial debond process can be identified, i. e. totally unstable, partially stable and totally stable. The stability of the debond process is governed not only by elastic constants, relative volume of fibre and matrix but more importantly by the nature of bonding at the interface and embedded fibre length, L. It is found that for the epoxy-based matrix composite systems, Gao et al. 's model [17] predicts the trend of maximum debond stress, sigma(d) {*} very well for long L, but it always overestimates sigma(d) {*} for very short L. In contrast, Hsueh's model [11] has the capability to predict sigma(d) {*} for short L, but it often needs significant <b>adjustment</b> to the <b>bond</b> shear strength for a better fit of the experimental results for long L. For a ceramic-based matrix composite, sigma(d) {*} predicted by the two models agree exceptionally well with experiment over almost the whole range of L, a reflection that the assumed stable debond process in theory is actually achieved in practice. With respect to the initial frictional pull-out stress, sigma(f), the agreement between the two theories and experiments is excellent for all range of L and all composite systems, suggesting that the solutions for sigma(f) proposed by the two models are essentially identical. Although Gao et al. 's model has the advantage to determine accurately the important interfacial properties such as residual clamping stress, q(O), and coefficient of friction, mu, it needs some modifications if accurate predictions of sigma(d) {*} are sought for very short L. These include varying interfacial fracture toughness, G(ic) with debond crack growth, unstable debonding for very short L and inclusion of shear deformation in the matrix for the evaluation of G(ic) and fibre stress distribution. Hsueh's model may also be improved to obtain a better solution by including the effect of matrix axial stress existing at the debonded region on the frictionless debond stress, sigma(O) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the impact of the prison environment on Lifers 2 ̆ 7 identity. It was hypothesized that individuals exposed to a prison environment, especially for long periods of time, are likely to experience conversion, or transformation to a 2 ̆ 2 convict 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 inmate 2 ̆ 2 identity. Using a symbolic interactionist theoretical approach, and John Lofland 2 ̆ 7 s model of identity transformation as a guideline, processes of social interaction, which may produce transformation of identity were examined within the prison environment. The research was conducted in federal penitentiaries in Kingston, Ontario. The methodology consisted of face-to-face interviews with 40 Lifers. Data analysis focuses on the processes of identity transformation: Patterns of interaction, social processes relating to <b>adjustment</b> to prison, <b>bonding</b> with the prison environment and other prisoners, the nature of contact with family (extra-institutional bonds), family impact on the conversion process, and intensive interaction. Lifers experience tension {{at the beginning of their}} sentence. Efforts to neutralize tension involve learning the prison subcultural norms during initial periods of incarceration. As such, transfer into prison represents a turning point to Lifers. Lifers bond with the prison world, to the extent that they adopt a subcultural 2 ̆ 2 code of behaviour. 2 ̆ 2 Friendships develop after a slow, strategic, and cautious process. Often, Lifers maintain contact with family members through visits, letters, and phonecalls. Administrative restrictions on visits, geographical separation, and selective dissemination of information by Lifers to their families, makes it impossible for family members to influence the conversion. Lifers also interact with other prisoners through direct and/or non-verbal communication. Information is relayed about prescriptions for behaviour and eventually, they adopt a set of attitudes which help them survive in the prison environment. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2010. As major {{corporate}} entities {{are investing}} into Sub-Saharan Africa and other African countries {{at a fast}} pace, percentages like the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and the impairment discount rate, are becoming important measurements of assessing current investments for impairment and/or proposals of future capital investments. One of the important constituents of these percentages is the country/equity risk premium. The country risk premium {{can be defined as}} the price for taking risk for investing in that specific country. A widely used method to determine the country risk premium is to multiply the country bond default spread with an equity to <b>bond</b> market risk <b>adjustment.</b> Country <b>bond</b> default spreads are the spreads that investors charge for buying bonds issued by the country. These ratings measure default risk, rather than equity risk, but they are affected by many factors that drive equity risk, like the stability of a country’s currency, the budget and trade balances and the political stability. Analysis that uses spreads as a measure of country risk, usually adds them to both the cost of equity and debt of entities that trade in that country. There are several ways in determining the bond default spreads, but it is most often done in a random and unsystematic manner. Two of the major obstacles in determining these spreads for countries, especially countries of sub-Saharan Africa, are when countries do not issue bonds in another currency such as Euro or US dollar and/or do not have a sovereign credit rating. What could also be a measure of country risk, are the two major country risk polls conducted globally: 1) Euromoney Country Risk Poll; and 2) PRS (Political Risk Group) Composite Risk Ratings. Most of sub-Saharan African countries form part of these risk polls. The usefulness of the PRS scores as a measure of country risk has been previously examined to find that they are correlated with the cost of capital of emerging markets. The aim of the research is to overcome the obstacles in determining default spreads for countries such as sub-Saharan Africa where bond markets are inactive and/or sovereign credit ratings are not assigned, by deriving a predictive model. The predictive model is derived by analysing the relationship between the available estimated default spreads that are assigned to a specific country, depending on their Moody’s sovereign local currency rating and the countries’ respective country risk scores conducted by Euromoney and PRS respectively. The stability of the relationship is also analysed by comparing the prediction of the sub-Saharan’s Africa default spreads based on the 2010 predictive model to the analyses conducted on 2008 data sets. Other similar models have been developed, but this model is focused on the total risk score of a country and not only on the credit risk or related constituents. One of the definitions of country risk is that it relates to the likelihood that changes in the business environment will occur that reduce the profitability of doing business in a country, which can negatively affect operating profits as well as the value of assets. One can conclude that this derived model is a good reflection of prevailing political and economic stability of the countries and a useful measure of country risk {{that can be used in}} assessing the profitability of current investments in a specific country and for proposals of future capital investments.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the corporate bond market is not well understood. Although many of the factors used to analyze stock market efficiency translate with some <b>adjustments</b> to corporate <b>bond</b> markets, the cause-effect factor is not intuitive and can {{be a source of}} significant confusion. In this manuscript we analyze bond market efficiency {{in the context of a}} recent court decision. In recent litigation concerning allegations of securities fraud perpetrated by the American International Group (AIG), the federal district court for the Southern District of New York declined to certify a class of bondholders, citing lack of common questions of law or fact. The decision turned on an empirical analysis of whether certain AIG bonds traded in an open, developed and efficient market. If the market for these bonds had been found efficient, there would have been grounds to certify the bondholders as a class. Ironically, the court found insufficient empirical evidence to hold that the $ 1. 71 billion in AIG bonds, issued by the world’s largest insurance company, traded in efficient markets. Unfortunately, the AIG court missed salient differences between the stock and bond markets in reaching its conclusion. Our manuscript describes the analysis missed by the court and supports a contrary result. Part I provides an overview of the law as it has developed regarding certification of class actions and the elements of a claim of fraud on the market as relevant to the lead plaintiffs’ claims of violations of the securities laws. Part II introduces the required empirical analysis and benchmarks to evaluate a claim of fraud on the market. Part III continues with a theoretical discussion of the distinctions missing in the AIG analysis between bonds and stocks relevant to determining whether the bond market should be afforded the fraud on the market presumption. Part IV builds on this with a discussion of our alternate empirical analyses. Concluding remarks follow. The AIG decision has serious implications not only for the corporate bond market but also for public policy. Private securities fraud class actions are an important mechanism for deterring fraud and promoting confidence in the securities markets. When market efficiency is important for determining certification of a class of security holders, it is critical that courts carefully consider how different markets operate...|$|R

Relative term {{structure and the}} predictability of the USD/AUD exchange rate [...] Chapter 4.

The impact of changes in monetary policy on the Australian term structure of interest rates : evidence from intraday data [...] Chapter 6. Monetary policy announcements and jumps in the term structure of Australian Treasury bond yields [...] Chapter 7. Conclusions. This thesis consists of five key chapters. The first two correspond to papers on exchange rate predictability (Chapters 2 and 3), and the next three focus {{on the effect of}} monetary policy announcements on the Australian term structure of interest rates (Chapters 4, 5, and 6). Chapter 2 estimates the Uncovered Interest Parity condition (UIP) for Australia using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) methods. Until recently, estimates of UIP used Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) methods to estimate the correlation However, in the presence of an omitted risk premium, the OLS estimate of the slope coefficient in the relationship will be biased and inconsistent. This chapter instead employs the GMM methods that relate the risk premium to the underlying economic variables to overcome the problem of omitted variables. After accounting for the unobservable risk premium, the slope coefficients are closer to their theoretical value of one. In addition, the GMM estimated equations perform better than the random walk and the OLS estimated equations in forecasting the exchange rate over short horizons. Chapter 3 undertakes an empirical investigation of information implied in the relative term structure of interest rates on the United States dollar (USD) /Australian dollar (USD/AUD) exchange rate. We interpret the information on macroeconomic fundamentals behind the relative factors of yield curve to account for predictable exchange rate changes. Our results show that the slope and curvature factors of the Australian yield curve relative to the US one can predict the USD/AUD exchange rate movements and excess returns on the AUD from one month to two years ahead. Moreover, our model performs better than the random walk in forecasting the USD/AUD exchange rate at horizons longer than 12 months. Chapter 4 investigates the effect of the target cash rate announcements on the term structure of interest rates in Australia using daily data. We find that unanticipated changes in the cash rate target significantly impact the entire term structure of interest rates, with the impact becoming smaller for longer maturities. We also compare volatilities across the term structure of interest rates on policy and non-policy announcement days and again find that the impact of monetary policy announcements on interest rate declines with maturity. More specifically, short-term interest rate volatility rises more than triple in the policy days while in the long-term, interest rate volatilities are {{more or less the same}} as those for non-policy days. Chapter 5 narrows the windows around Australian monetary policy announcements by employing intra-day data to mitigate the effect of other news on market interest rates on the announcement days. This method allows for a more precise evaluation of the impact of monetary policy announcements on the term structure of interest rates. Our results from intraday data show the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announcements have significant impacts on the Australian term structure of Treasury bond yields that decline as the term to maturity increases. In addition, the <b>adjustments</b> of Treasury <b>bond</b> yields to the announcements are almost finished only 30 minutes after the announcement. Chapter 6 investigates whether monetary policy announcements result in jumps in the term structure of Australian Treasury bond yields. Using intraday data on the Australian Treasury bonds yields provided by the Securities Industry Research Centre of Asia-Pacific (SIRCA) for the period from January 1996 to December 2012, we find significant evidence of jumps across the term structure of Australian Treasury bond yields on the days of the release of the monetary policy decision by the RBA. The surprise component in the monetary announcement generates a surge in Treasury bond returns. Mode of access: World wide web 1 online resource (xvi, 157 pages) illustration...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, Graduate School of Business Administration, 2014. Defined as {{an opinion}} by the rating {{agencies}} {{on the ability}} and willingness of a sovereign government to meet financial commitments in full and at an agreed time, {{a number of studies}} argue that sovereign credit ratings are a de facto requirement for gaining access to international capital (Cantor & Packer, 1995; Larraín, Reisen & Von Maltzan, 1997; Siddiqi, 2007), While a number of studies such as that by Kaminsky and Schmukler (2002) have tested the short-term announcement impact of the sovereign credit rating <b>adjustments</b> on the <b>bond</b> and equity returns. Kim and Wu (2008) attempted to close this knowledge gap by investigating the impact of S&P issued sovereign credit ratings on emerging economies’ financial markets and different types of capital flows. In addition, studies on sovereign credit ratings focus on emerging economies, leaving out a majority of the African countries that are largely classified as developing economies. Accordingly, the primary aim of the present study is to investigate the relationship between Fitch, Moody’s and S&P issued long-term foreign currency sovereign credit ratings and the different types of capital flows in Africa. In addition, the study investigates how the imminent and actual rating migration announcement by Fitch, Moody’s and S&P impact the aggregate equity stocks and nominal exchange rate returns in Africa. The study addresses these two questions by using a comprehensive data set of long-term foreign currency sovereign credit ratings issued by Fitch, Moody’s and S&P on a cross-section of 28 African countries, between 1994 and 2011. Through a panel data regression framework, the study investigates the long-term influence of long-term foreign currency sovereign credit ratings on the different types of capital flows (foreign direct investment, portfolio equity, portfolio bond and commercial bank and other private institutions) while controlling for economic and country governance factors. The second question of the study is addressed by applying event study analysis, to test the transitory impact of long-term foreign currency sovereign credit ratings daily aggregate equity stock returns and nominal foreign exchange rate. Overall, the empirical analysis demonstrates that the history of the portfolio equity, FDI and borrowings from commercial banks and other private institutions, represented by the lag of the capital flows, is the most significant variable determinant of these types of flows. For the vi borrowings from commercial banks and other private institutions, empirical evidence also suggests that debt rescheduling is a significant determinant for future access to this type of capital. Long-term foreign currency sovereign credit ratings issued by Fitch, Moody’s and S&P on the other hand, show a marginal influence on the portfolio equity, FDI and borrowings from commercial banks and other private institution capital flows with the RATING variable reinforcing, as opposed to substituting, for the primary determinants of these types of capital flows. For the public and publicly guaranteed and non-guaranteed portfolio bond flows, where, except for South Africa, many African countries have a limited history of borrowing from the international bond markets, the lag of the dependent variable is insignificant. Empirical evidence further shows that the public and publicly guaranteed and non-guaranteed portfolio bond flows respond differently to the long-term foreign currency sovereign credit ratings issued by the different rating agencies. While S&P issued RATINGS variable is significant for the public and publicly guaranteed portfolio bond net flow rates (PPGBOND) model, when South Africa is excluded from the sample, Fitch issued RATINGS variable is significant for the non-guaranteed portfolio bond net flow rates (PNGBOND). Interestingly, the empirical evidence show that South Africa’s Fitch, Moody’s and S&P issued RATINGS have a positive relationship with both portfolio bond and commercial bank and other private institutions net flow rates to countries other than South Africa. In particular, the public and publicly guaranteed portfolio bond (PPGBOND) and commercial bank and other private institutions net flow rates (PPGCOMM) for countries other than South Africa, respond positively to the S&P and Fitch issued South Africa RATING, with own country RATING becoming insignificant when the S&P issued South African RATING is introduced to the model. Similarly both the PPGCOMM and PNGBOND net flow rates to countries other than South Africa, respond positively to the Moody’s issued South African RATING. Event study analysis show that long-term foreign currency sovereign credit ratings upgrade, downgrades eminent rating changes have a short-term announcement impact on both the aggregate equity stock and nominal foreign exchange rate returns in Africa. In particular, the event study results show that there is an incentive for a positive rating announcement for below investment grade ratings while there is no punishment for a negative rating announcement...|$|R
40|$|Transcription begins] 27 December 1944 Somewheres [sic] in Belgium My adorable sweetheart, Today was {{a joyous}} {{day for me}} for it {{signaled}} the resumption of mail. Yes, darling, I received a V-Mail from you dated Dec. 4, an air mail from Capt. Harry Speert in the ETO dated Dec. 15 {{and the best of}} all, a 4 pg. air mail letter from you dated Dec. 16 ! In addition to the above, I received a box containing cookies, etc. from Aunt Sadie—Good old Aunt Sadie. This mail out-going situation is really funny. I gave some letters which I wrote three days ago to a fellow officer to mail for me since he had to make a trip to Holland. Sure enough, he forgot his 2 ̆ 6 my letters. For the past 3 days we had no APO set-up here. Today, when the APO finally set up here, the Bn mail clerk finds the sack of mail (outgoing) among his incoming mail. No doubt the APO clerk made a mistake. Result: The letters which I wrote to you 5 days ago will probably go out tomorrow—if everything is O. K. Before I forget, Lt. Alvoid Haygood is the pappa of a baby boy. His wife gave birth on Dec. 13 and he received the wire today. He was going around in circles all day today. His address at home is: Lt. 2 ̆ 6 Mrs. Alvoid Haygood M- 2 Bilbo St. Orange, Texas While I’m writing this letter, I’m munching on some of the honey-covered crinkles—very good—so are the brownies. The weather still continues to be cold (very cold) but as long as the sun comes out I don’t kick. Both Shelton and Haygood received your V-Mails today and showed them to me. Haygood’s reply was, “Vic, your wife is making love to you through me. ” Everybody knows all about my wonderful wife and I don’t mince words in telling them about you, honey. Strange as it may seem, I don’t boast either, merely state facts. Have you heard anything about the October allotment 2 ̆ 6 <b>bond</b> <b>adjustment</b> yet? Have you written to New Jersey again in that regard? Today I am smoking a long clay pipe [drawing of pipe]. I picked some up for some of the officers in a little store and we are having fun smoking them. Anything for a laugh these days. The American standard of war seems ironic at times. Despite the struggles and death of its soldiers, it does everything it possibly can to give them turkey on Christmas and even today we distributed PX rations to the soldiers—a truly great army only is capable of doing this. I’m glad to read that Byrnes (War Manpower Commissioner) finally got tough! With remorse, I say, that the Americans needed a “kick in the pants” to wake them out of their doldrums, thinking that the war was already won. I am enclosing a clipping from the “Stars 2 ̆ 6 Stripes” which will give you a better idea as to why the Belgians despise the “Boche”—our enemy. I want the people in the United States to know the Boche as he actually is. Along with that clipping was the story of the greatest sacrifice man can make—that’s what burns me up when I hear about the way some people at home feel about the war. Do you see my point, darling? Harry Speert writes me that he is located in the vicinity of Paris and should I ever get a pass he should [sic] like to arrange a meeting. He’s a good kid and if anything like the above should ever materialize, I’d like to see him. Did you ever receive any of the stuff I sent you? I presume it takes much longer for a package to come to you than it takes for one to come to me. Mimi and Joseph are still two of the most adorable kids I’ve ever seen. Mimi is really a little dear. She follows me around like a pet kitten. The little snapshot I sent you doesn’t begin to do her justice. She has a tuft of curl across the top of her hair just like you wear it. The magazines you send me are excellent and I appreciate you sending me magazines whenever you can. I f you can read Pyles’ Brave Men, do so—it’s an excellent book and gives you a good slant on the dough-boy—of whom I think the world 2 ̆ 6 all. Darling, from your dreams, someone would gather that I really please you. After all, dear, I do my best! When I read the description of your dream I got all “hot and bothered. ” I can’t afford those kind[s] of dreams or else I’d be constantly washing my clothes (?). Sweetheart, you are the perfect mate that a man searches for all his life. Every one of your thoughts, your actions, your desires, and your moods seem to blend into mine divinely. Gosh, if I could only do {{some of the things that}} you dream about! There’ll come a day I promise you. Gee, dearest, I’ve got to attend to a few little things so I’ll say goodnight and pleasant dreams. You’re forever in my thoughts. Love, Vic [Transcription ends...|$|R
