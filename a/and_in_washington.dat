5|$|Two American presidents {{had been}} assassinated in the 19th century—Abraham Lincoln in 1865 and James A. Garfield in 1881. Even {{considering}} this history, McKinley {{did not like}} security personnel to come {{between him and the}} people. When in his hometown, Canton, Ohio, he often walked to church or the business district without protection, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> went on drives with his wife without any guard in the carriage.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Chadwick {{carried out}} {{research}} {{as part of}} the Tube Alloys project to build an atomic bomb, while his Liverpool lab and environs were harassed by Luftwaffe bombing. When the Quebec Agreement merged his project with the American Manhattan Project, he became part of the British Mission, and worked at the Los Alamos Laboratory <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. He surprised everyone by earning the almost-complete trust of project director Leslie R. Groves, Jr. For his efforts, Chadwick received a knighthood in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1945. In July 1945, he viewed the Trinity nuclear test. After this, he served as the British scientific advisor to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. Uncomfortable with the trend toward Big Science, Chadwick became the Master of Gonville and Caius College in 1948. He retired in 1959.|$|E

5|$|Parsons' newfound {{credentials}} and financial security {{gave him the}} opportunity to travel more widely throughout the U.S. as an ambassador for Aerojet, meeting with other rocket enthusiasts. In New York he met with Karl Germer, the head of the O.T.O. in North America <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. he met Poet Laureate Joseph Auslander, donating some of Crowley's poetry books to the Library of Congress. He also became a regular at the Mañana Literary Society, which met in Laurel Canyon at the home of Parsons' friend Robert A. Heinlein and included science fiction writers including Cleve Cartmill, Jack Williamson, and Anthony Boucher. Among Parsons' favorite works of fiction was Williamson's Darker Than You Think, a novelette published in the fantasy magazine Unknown in 1940, which inspired his later occult workings. Boucher used Parsons as a partial basis for the character of Hugo Chantrelle in his murder mystery Rocket to the Morgue (1942).|$|E
5|$|While Glenn {{was on duty}} at Patuxent <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> he read {{everything}} he could find about space. His office was asked to send a test pilot to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia to make runs on a spaceflight simulator, as part of research by the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) into re-entry vehicle shapes. The pilot would also {{be sent to the}} Naval Air Development Center in Johnsville, Pennsylvania, and would be subjected to high g-forces in a centrifuge for comparison with data collected in the simulator. His request for the position was granted, and he spent several days at Langley and a week in Johnsville for the testing. NASA asked military-service members to participate in planning the mockup of a spacecraft. Since he had participated in the research at Langley and Johnsville, he was sent to the McDonnell plant in St. Louis as a service adviser to NASA's spacecraft mockup board.|$|E

25|$|In Saint Louis, Missouri {{records of}} nearly 300 {{petition}} {{cases have been}} found that were filed between 1807 and 1860, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. nearly 500 petition cases were filed in the same period.

In {{the early nineteenth century}} in St. Louis <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., nearly half of the attorneys at the bar may have acted as counsel for slave petitions. In Missouri, the courts assigned an attorney to the petitioner if it accepted a freedom suit for hearing; some of the top attorneys in St. Louis defended slaves. After the 1830s, the number of petition cases gradually declined. But from 1800 to 1830, most of the bar in these cities tried a petition case.|$|E

25|$|Petraeus had a {{strategy}} to influence military conditions by using the press relations effectively in the theater <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> according to critics of the general's military career after his fall from power. On November 13, 2012, Reagan administration Assistant Secretary of Defense Lawrence Korb, C.I.A. analyst and Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity co-founder Ray McGovern, and investigative journalist Gareth Porter appeared on Al Jazeera English. Together they assessed the general's extensive military-medi{{a strategy}} linking his writings on counterguerrilla operations and subsequent military media efforts, to his downfall with his female biographer. Critics said that the Petraeus media strategy would prove damaging for American policy in the future because of omissions and distorted interpretations that Washington policymakers, other experts, and the American public accepted from Petraeus's media contacts.|$|E
25|$|To file {{petitions}} for freedom, enslaved plaintiffs {{demonstrated an}} impressive {{knowledge of their}} rights and an equally impressive sense of calculated risk. For the most part, persistence paid off, and petitioners who filed multiple suits {{were more likely to}} eventually succeed. Petitioners retained preeminent attorneys; in Washington, DC, they included Francis Scott Key, Richard Ridgely, John Law, William Wirt, Gabriel Duvall, and John Johnson. In St. Louis, if the court accepted a freedom suit, it assigned an attorney for the slave petitioner. Among the notable attorneys representing slaves in St. Louis was Edward Bates, future Attorney General under President Abraham Lincoln. During the early nineteenth century in St. Louis <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., nearly half of the attorneys at the bar may have acted as counsel for slave petitions.
