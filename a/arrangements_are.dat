5|$|Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale is a {{collection}} of orchestral arrangements of Final Fantasy VI music composed by Nobuo Uematsu and arranged by Shiro Sagisu and Tsuneyoshi Saito. It was initially released through NTT Publishing on May 25, 1994 under the catalog number PSCN-5004 and subsequently re-released on October 1, 2004 under the catalog number NTCP-5004. The <b>arrangements</b> <b>are</b> performed by the Milan Symphony Orchestra, with vocal performances by Svetla Krasteva. The album spans 11 tracks and covers a duration of 54:33.|$|E
5|$|Seneb was a dwarf {{who served}} as a {{high-ranking}} court official in the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt, circa 2520 BC.

5|$|Final Symphony II is a symphonic concert tour first {{held at the}} Beethovenhalle in Bonn, Germany on August 29, 2015 and {{continuing}} to date. The concert tour features arrangements of video game music selected from the Final Fantasy series, specifically Final Fantasy V, VIII, IX, and XIII. It is divided into four acts, one per game, with the newest game, Final Fantasy XIII, first, and the oldest, V, last; all four <b>arrangements</b> <b>are</b> single-section arrangements, with the IX portion as a piano concerto. The tour is a follow up to Final Symphony, a similar tour of orchestral arrangement performances from Final Fantasy VI, VII, and X beginning in 2013 {{and continuing}} to date. The concert is produced and directed by Thomas Böcker of Merregnon Studios, with arrangements provided by Finnish composer and musician Jonne Valtonen, along with Roger Wanamo and Final Fantasy XIII composer Masashi Hamauzu. The original works were composed by Nobuo Uematsu and Hamauzu, and an introductory piece was composed by Valtonen. The premiere concert was performed by the Beethoven Orchestra Bonn under conduction from Eckehard Stier, with guest performer Mischa Cheung joining the orchestra on piano.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a shot of Minogue posing in a dark room, dressed in a {{sparkling}} costume on which rainbow-lighting is projected. She is then shown {{in front of a}} wall wearing a flowing maroon dress. As the intro ends and the first verse commences, Minogue appears in a hall and performs various dance routine with numerous female dancers clad in nude bodysuits. The singer's attire consists of a pleated red organza dress designed by Austrian fashion designer Helmut Lang (in 2006, Minogue donated this costume to the Arts Centre Melbourne museum, where it is displayed in the Kylie Minogue Collection). Shots of the dancers in kaleidoscopic <b>arrangements</b> <b>are</b> intercut. A few seconds later, Minogue and a man dance together alone in a hall. Their dance ends with the man slowly laying Minogue {{down on the floor and}} leaving. Twelve women in golden and pastel pink dresses are seen dancing on a dark brown floor, which is revealed to be Minogue's hat as the camera pans out. She proceeds to wave to a distant person and then plucks the petals out of a pink rose she is holding. The rest of the video randomly intersperses all of the previous scenes.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, {{problems}} with viewing attachment as a trait (stable characteristic of an individual) {{rather than as}} a type of behaviour with organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to the conclusion that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life. This way of thinking saw the secure base concept as central to attachment theory's logic, coherence, and status as an organizational construct. Following this argument, the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans cross-culturally was examined. The research showed that though there were cultural differences, the three basic patterns, secure, avoidant and ambivalent, can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping <b>arrangements</b> <b>are</b> the norm.Selection of the secure pattern is found in the majority of children across cultures studied. This follows logically from the fact that attachment theory provides for infants to adapt to changes in the environment, selecting optimal behavioural strategies. How attachment is expressed shows cultural variations which need to be ascertained before studies can be undertaken; for example Gusii infants are greeted with a handshake rather than a hug. Securely attached Gusii infants anticipate and seek this contact. There are also differences in the distribution of insecure patterns based on cultural differences in child-rearing practices. The scholar Michael Rutter in 1974 studied the importance of distinguishing between the consequences of attachment deprivation upon intellectual retardation in children and lack of development in the emotional growth in children. Rutter's conclusion was that a careful delineation of maternal attributes needed to be identified and differentiated for progress in the field to continue.|$|E

40|$|DE 102009030883 A 1 UPAB: 20110101 NOVELTY - The {{system has}} a light {{generation}} arrangement (2) comprising a light source. A sensor arrangement (4) detects position and/or orientation of a defined sub section (5) of a spatially structured and/or time-varying light structure (3). The sensor <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> fixed at a movable section. The light generation <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> designed {{such that the}} light structure is formed in a position space (O). The light generation <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> fixed at the section such that the light structure is formed relative to the section, and the sensor <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> arranged in the position space. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for determining position and/or orientation of a handling unit. USE - Positioning determining system for calibrating and/or positioning and/or measuring position/orientation of handling unit such as robot, processing unit, mounting unit, machine tool, manufacturing system, coordinate measuring device and/or automated handling equipment (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - The light generation <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> fixed at the movable section such that the light structure is formed relative to the section, and the sensor <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> arranged in the position space, thus measuring position/orientation of the handling unit in a simple and highly accurate manner without disturbing interferences...|$|R
