5|$|According to British writer Errol Fuller, aviculturalists are rumoured to have bred birds {{similar in}} {{appearance}} to the Cuban macaw. These birds, however, <b>are</b> <b>reportedly</b> larger in size than the Cuban macaw, having been bred from larger macaw species.|$|E
5|$|Ritter von Laurin, the Austrian {{consul-general}} in Egypt, {{was able}} to inspect a fragment of the Stone removed by Muhammad Ali in 1817 and reported {{that it had a}} pitch-black exterior and a silver-grey, fine-grained interior in which tiny cubes of a bottle-green material were embedded. There <b>are</b> <b>reportedly</b> a few white or yellow spots {{on the face of the}} Stone, and it is officially described as being white with the exception of the face.|$|E
5|$|The puffball is edible {{when the}} gleba is still firm and white. They <b>are</b> <b>reportedly</b> {{consumed}} by the tribal people of Madhya Pradesh. In Mexico, a large collection was consumed by several people who confused the species with Calvatia, a puffball genus containing popular edible members. Of the five who ate the fungus, two had gastrointestinal symptoms including stomachache, flatulence, and diarrhea; the other three did not have symptoms. The large European bird great bustard (Otis tarda) has been recorded feeding on the puffball.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, {{paleontologist}} Phil Currie reported skin impressions {{from the}} holotype specimen of G. libratus. He originally reported the skin as being essentially smooth and lacking the scales {{found in other}} dinosaurs, similar to the secondarily featherless skin found in large modern birds. Scales of some sort were present in this specimen, but they <b>are</b> <b>reportedly</b> widely dispersed {{from each other and}} very small. Other patches of isolated Gorgosaurus skin shows denser, and larger though still relatively fine scales (smaller than hadrosaurid scales and approximately as fine as a Gila monster's). Neither of these specimens was associated with any particular bone or specific body area. In the Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs Kenneth Carpenter pointed out that traces of skin impressions from the tail of Gorgosaurus showed similar small rounded or hexagonal scales.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Sukhoi {{embarked}} on a second modernization of the Su-27 {{to serve as an}} interim aircraft awaiting the development of the Sukhoi PAK FA (Su-57) program. Also known as Su-35, this derivative has a redesigned cockpit and weapons-control system compared to the Su-27M, and features thrust-vectoring engines in place of the omitted canards. The type made its first flight in February 2008. Although the aircraft was designed for export, the Russian Air Force in 2009 became the launch customer of the aircraft, the production version of which is designated Su-35S. China's People's Liberation Army Air Force is the sole foreign user of the aircraft. Other countries <b>are</b> <b>reportedly</b> in discussions with Russia about the possible purchase of the Su-35, among which is Indonesia, whose government is expected to sign a contract in the near future.|$|E

5|$|Several {{apparently}} unprovoked {{attacks on}} humans {{have been attributed}} to the sicklefin lemon shark. Due to its formidable size and teeth, it is regarded as potentially dangerous, and certainly this species has been known to defend itself quickly and vigorously if touched, speared, or otherwise provoked or alarmed. Once agitated, this shark can be a persistent adversary; in one case, a shark forced a swimmer to seek refuge atop a coral head, and circled for hours before giving up. However, observations by divers show that normally this shark is shy and hesitant to approach, even when presented with bait. Often, the shark will move away when a diver enters visual range. Young sharks <b>are</b> <b>reportedly</b> more aggressive and inquisitive than the adults. At Moorea, sicklefin lemon sharks are the main attraction of daily shark-feeding ecotourism dives. This shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquariums.|$|E
5|$|Mammalian prey {{includes}} rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, raccoons (Procyon lotor), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), beavers (Castor canadensis), {{and deer}} fawns. Newborn, dead, sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted. However, more formidable prey such as adult raccoons and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked. In the Chesapeake Bay area, bald eagles <b>are</b> <b>reportedly</b> the main natural predators of raccoons. Where available, seal colonies can provide much food. On Protection Island, Washington, they commonly feed on harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) afterbirths, still-borns and sickly seal pups. On San Juan Island in Washington, introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), mainly those killed by auto accidents, comprise nearly 60% of the dietary intake of eagles. In landlocked areas of North America, wintering bald eagles may become habitual predators of medium-sized mammals {{that occur in}} colonies or local concentrations, such as prairie dogs (Cynomys) and jackrabbits (Lepus). Together with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially sheep (Ovis aries). There {{are a handful of}} proven cases of lamb predation, some of specimens weighing up to , by bald eagles but they are much less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle and both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods. There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult, pregnant ewe (then joined in eating the kill by at least 3 other eagles), which, weighing on average over , is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species.|$|E
