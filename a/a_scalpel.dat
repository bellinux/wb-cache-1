5|$|Alongside {{traditional}} piercing techniques, modern body adornment includes variant {{techniques such}} as pocketing and flesh stapling, although as of 2007 these were still not widely made available by piercers. In the first of these, <b>a</b> <b>scalpel</b> opens the skin or mucous membranes, into which the larger end {{of a piece of}} jewellery or—if using a bar—two ends are inserted. These kinds of piercings may be difficult to remove, as fibrous tissue can form around the end or ends of the jewellery or the implanted tube into which the jewellery is placed. When a bar is used, pocketing looks quite similar to flesh stapling. The latter technique is frequently done {{in the form of a}} ladder. Modern body piercing practices also include dermal anchoring or dermal piercing, which combines piercing and implantation to create a single point of opening in the body (whereas pocketing creates two) to permit one end of the jewellery to show above the surface of the skin. While this technique can be performed almost anywhere on the body, as of 2007 it was popularly done between the eyes, on the chest, or on the finger, to simulate a ring.|$|E
5|$|Harold is escorted {{back to the}} {{psychiatric}} center where he is tormented by Nurse Innes (Nancy Fish). Later, Mulder finds Innes lying on the floor, half-conscious. Innes claims Harold went berserk and attacked her. One of the other patients, Chuck Forsch, tells Scully that Nurse Innes was trying to poison Harold. Scully slowly realizes that Innes, not Harold, {{was responsible for the}} murders. When Innes attacks Scully with <b>a</b> <b>scalpel,</b> Scully draws her weapon and fires, striking her in the shoulder. While summarizing the case with Mulder, Scully explains that Innes had been taking Harold's unused medication, triggering violent and unpredictable behavior. Scully hypothesizes that Innes committed the murders in order to destroy the love Harold felt towards the young women. Later, Harold's body is discovered in a nearby alley, the apparent victim of respiratory failure. Scully, however, suspects that Harold died from what Innes took away from him. Scully admits to Mulder that she saw the ghost of the fourth victim shortly after she was murdered. Later, Scully sees Harold's spirit sitting {{in the back seat of}} her car.|$|E
5|$|Tracheotomy {{consists}} {{of making an}} incision {{on the front of}} the neck and opening a direct airway through an incision in the trachea. The resulting opening can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheostomy tube to be inserted; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use of his nose or mouth. The opening may be made by <b>a</b> <b>scalpel</b> or a needle (referred to as surgical and percutaneous techniques respectively) and both techniques are widely used in current practice. In order to limit the risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves (the nerves that control the voicebox), the tracheotomy is performed as high in the trachea as possible. If only one of these nerves is damaged, the patient's voice may be impaired (dysphonia); if both of the nerves are damaged, the patient will be unable to speak (aphonia). In the acute setting, indications for tracheotomy are similar to those for cricothyrotomy. In the chronic setting, indications for tracheotomy include the need for long-term mechanical ventilation and removal of tracheal secretions (e.g., comatose patients, or extensive surgery involving the head and neck).|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveVasospasm is {{the primary}} {{obstacle}} to widespread adoption of the radial artery as a conduit in coronary artery bypass grafting. We used optical coherence tomography, a catheter-based intravascular imaging modality, to measure the degree of radial artery spasm induced by means of harvest with electrocautery or <b>a</b> harmonic <b>scalpel</b> in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. MethodsRadial arteries were harvested from 44 consecutive patients with <b>a</b> harmonic <b>scalpel</b> (n = 15) or electrocautery (n = 29). Vessels were imaged before harvesting and after removal from the arm, with saphenous vein tracts serving as internal controls. Optical coherence tomographic findings for the degree of harvesting-induced injury were validated against histologic measures. ResultsOptical coherence tomographic measures of endovascular dimensions and injury correlated strongly with histologic findings. Mean luminal volume, a measure of vasospasm, decreased significantly less after harvesting with <b>a</b> harmonic <b>scalpel</b> (9 % ± 7 %) than with electrocautery (35 % ± 6 %, P =. 015). Completely intact intima was present in 11 (73 %) of 15 radial arteries harvested with <b>a</b> harmonic <b>scalpel</b> (73 %) compared with 9 of 29 arteries harvested by means of electrocautery (31 %, P =. 011). Intraoperative flow measurements and patency rates at 5 days postoperatively {{were not significantly different}} among groups. ConclusionsOptical coherence tomography provides a level of speed and accuracy for quantifying endothelial injury and vasospasm that has not been described for any other modality, suggesting potential as an intraoperative quality assurance tool. Our optical coherence tomographic findings suggest that the harmonic scalpel induces less spasm and intimal injury compared with electrocautery...|$|R
25|$|Labial {{reduction}} {{by means}} of the de-epithelialization of the tissues involves cutting the epithelium of a central area on the medial and lateral aspects of each labium minus (small lip), either with <b>a</b> <b>scalpel</b> or with a medical laser. This labiaplasty technique reduces the vertical excess tissue, whilst preserving the natural rugosity (corrugated free-edge) of the labia minora, and thus preserves the sensory and erectile characteristics of the labia. Yet, the technical disadvantage of de-epithelialization is that the width of the individual labium might increase if a large area of labial tissue must be de-epithelialized to achieve the labial reduction.|$|E
25|$|For {{the past}} 50 years at least, {{tonsillectomy}} has been performed by dissecting the tonsil from its surrounding fascia, a so-called 'total', or extra-capsular tonsillectomy. Problems including pain and bleeding {{led to a}} recent resurgence in interest in sub-total tonsillectomy or 'tonsillotomy' which was popular 60–100 years ago, {{in an effort to}} reduce these complications. The generally accepted procedure for 'total' tonsillectomy uses <b>a</b> <b>scalpel</b> and blunt dissection or electrocautery, although harmonic scalpels or lasers have also been used. Bleeding is stopped with electrocautery, ligation by sutures, and the topical use of thrombin, a protein that induces blood clotting.|$|E

30|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that blood loss during mastectomy was {{associated}} with the size of resection (Yamaguchi et al. 2008; Lai et al. 2016). Therefore, in order to address this matter, the present study analyzed both partial mastectomy and quadrantectomy, separately. Factors previously shown to influence blood loss in mastectomy have included the size of resection, age >[*] 80  years, steroid use, and congestive heart failure (Winther Lietzen et al. 2012; Nwaogu et al. 2015). In high-risk patients, the appropriate methods should be chosen in order to reduce blood loss. These include local injection of adrenaline (Chelliah 2003), use of <b>a</b> harmonic <b>scalpel</b> (Deo et al. 2002), and deliberate hypotensive anesthesia (Moersch et al. 1960). A local injection of adrenaline does not cover the whole surgical field if the resection area is large, and it is unable to reach deep surgical sites. Additionally, the harmonic scalpel is limited to facilities that approve its use. Furthermore, <b>a</b> harmonic <b>scalpel</b> is not readily available worldwide. Unlike adrenaline administration and the use of <b>a</b> harmonic <b>scalpel,</b> remifentanil is performed not by an operator, but by an anesthesiologist, and the effects of remifentanil are well known. The reduction in blood loss associated with remifentanil use {{in the present study was}} found to be independent of the techniques used by the anesthesiologists and surgeons.|$|R

His results using a technique involving removal of the tonsil with <b>a</b> <b>scalpel</b> and forceps were much better than partial removal; tonsillectomy using the guillotine eventually fell out of favor in America.|$|E
