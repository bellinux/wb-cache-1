5|$|Attendance was low, in {{part due}} to Tech fans' {{reluctance}} to travel <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> pay high prices for the chance to do so.

30|$|Based on the {{existing}} literature (Klenow and Rodri´guez-Claire 2005), this study assumes that the capital share (a[*]=[*] 1 / 3) is almost <b>the</b> same <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> also constant over the time.

While there is a significant variation across different economies in this parameter described by Gollin (2002), this deviation does not follow any specific pattern. In precise, once informality and entrepreneurship are taken into account, and it is not associated with the level of growth (GDP per capita).|$|R

The Indian military was placed on standby to undertake search-and-rescue missions immediately after the storms' passage. Fourteen districts of Gujarat were placed on red alert, the highest level of preparedness. Seven emergency control centers were set up <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> officials alerted hospitals and fire crews about the approaching storm.|$|E

5|$|Finding the {{financial}} demands of his Maidstone seat too much, Disraeli secured a Tory nomination for Shrewsbury, winning {{one of the}} constituency's two seats at the 1841 general election, despite serious opposition, and heavy debts which opponents seized on. The election was a massive defeat for the Whigs <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>and</b> Peel became Prime Minister. Disraeli hoped, unrealistically, for ministerial office. Though disappointed at being left on the back benches, he continued his support for Peel in 1842 and 1843, seeking to establish himself as an expert on foreign affairs and international trade.|$|E
