5|$|The third {{biological}} control agent to target Neoscapteriscus in Florida was the South American nematode Steinernema scapterisci. Small-scale releases proved it could persist for years in mole-cricket-infested sandy Florida soils. Its use as a biopesticide against Neoscapteriscus was patented, making it attractive to industry. Industrial-scale production on artificial diet allowed large-scale trial applications in pastures and on golf courses, which succeeded in establishing populations in several counties, and these populations spread, but sales were disappointing, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> was withdrawn from the market in 2014.|$|E

5|$|Apple {{unveiled}} the PowerBook100 on October 21, 1991, at the Comdex computer expo in Las Vegas, {{with two other}} models, the PowerBook 140 and PowerBook 170. The advertisement <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> were both successful. Apple projected US sales of more than 200,000 PowerBooks in the first year, with peak demand {{in the first three}} months of release. By January 1992, Apple had sold more than 100,000 PowerBooks, by which time they were in short supply. Apple soon solved the supply problems, and the proceeds from PowerBook sales reached $1billion in the first year after launch. Apple surpassed Toshiba and Compaq as the market leader in worldwide share of portable computer shipments. The PowerBook100, 140, and 170 contributed greatly to Apple's financial success in 1992. At the end of the financial year, Apple announced its highest figures yet, $7.1billion in revenues and an increase in global market share from 8% to 8.5%, the highest it had been in four years.|$|E
5|$|In 1556 the sheikdom {{was led by}} Sheikh Abu Rayyan bin Sheikh Manna, who was {{succeeded by}} Sheikh Muhammad Abu Rabban in 1560. Olive oil was the primary {{commodity}} that Bani Zeid Nahiya produced <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> was sold to local Ottoman officials and soap factories in Nablus. The Ottomans imposed taxes on olive oil, wheat and barley, and the sheikh was responsible for paying the revenues of collected taxes to the Ottoman authorities. In addition, Bani Zeid was required to finance a waqf (religious endowment) to the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. In 1596 both Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima appeared in Ottoman tax registers and both villages paid taxes on wheat, barley, olive trees, fruit trees, vineyards, goats and/or beehives. Deir Ghassaneh had a population of 76 households, all Muslim, while Beit Rima had 54 Muslim households and 14 Christian households. During {{the course of the}} 16th century, most of Beit Rima's Christian inhabitants had emigrated from the village to Jerusalem, Ramla and Gaza, although the Christian population that remained continued to grow.|$|E

He remained in the service as it became the United States Air Force, despite often being at odds with its leadership, and was one of its pioneer jet pilots. Rising to the command of two fighter wings, Olds is regarded among aviation historians, and his peers, as the best wing commander of the Vietnam War, for both his air-fighting skills, and his reputation as a combat leader.|$|E

5|$|International {{fast-food}} restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's {{have had a}} variety of grilled chicken sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1990. The BK Broiler was the first iteration, {{and was one of}} the most successful product introductions in the fast food industry to that point in time. However sales dropped in the following two years, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> was reformulated and renamed to the Chicken Whopper to align the product with the company's Whopper Sandwich. A change of ownership of Burger King in 2004 prompted another reformulation of the product into the BK Baguette product line that focused on a more health-oriented product. This new formulation proved unpopular and was replaced in 2005 with the TenderGrill chicken sandwich. The TenderGrill sandwich was introduced as part of a series of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old males. Burger King was the first major fast food chain to introduce a grilled chicken sandwich to the marketplace, beating rivals Wendy's by six months and McDonald's by four years. These two chains also went through a series of reformulations and naming schemes for their grilled chicken products.|$|E
