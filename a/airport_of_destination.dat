40|$|A regiÃo Oeste do ParanÃ, que, apesar de possuir uma infraestrutura de transportes significativa, capaz de dar suporte a importante rota de turismo nacional e internacional, apresenta pouca diversificaÃÃo no que diz respeito a transporte de passageiros. Assim, investimentos em infraestrutura, a localizaÃÃo e a Ãrea de influÃncia que o aeroporto de Cascavel tem sobre a regiÃo podem determinar a escolha desse modal pelos usuÃrios da regiÃo Oeste do ParanÃ como meio de transporte. Objetiva-se analisar a influÃncia [...] medida em distÃncia entre as cidades [...] e verificar qual a probabilidade de os municÃpios da regiÃo Oeste do ParanÃ de utilizarem o transporte aÃreo para os seus deslocamentos, verificaÃÃo a ser feita via aplicaÃÃo do modelo gravitacional de Huff. Para tanto, utilizaram-se as opÃÃes de destinos dos aeroportos de Cascavel, de Foz do IguaÃu e de MaringÃ. Os resultados demonstram que, na situaÃÃo atual, ou seja, com 34 opÃÃes de destinos, o aeroporto de Cascavel possui pouca influÃncia sobre os usuÃrios de transporte aÃreo da regiÃo. Numa hipÃtese, no entanto, em que os trÃs aeroportos analisados possuam o mesmo nÃmero de destinos, ou seja, 202, o aeroporto com maior possibilidade de crescimento e desenvolvimento Ã o de Cascavel.

The west {{region of}} the state of Parana, {{although}} having a significant transportation infrastructure, capable of supporting the important route of national and international tourism, presents little diversification in passenger transportation. This way, investments in infrastructure, location and influence area that the <b>airport</b> <b>of</b> Cascavel has on the region could determine the choice of this mode of transportation by users of the west region of Parana as means of transportation. The objective is to analyze the influence â measured in distance between the cities â and check what is the probability of the cities of the west region of Parana of using air transport for their displacements; verification to be done by application of Huffâs gravity model. For that, the options <b>of</b> <b>destinations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>airports</b> <b>of</b> Cascavel, Foz do IguaÃu and MaringÃ were used.

40|$|During {{the past}} three decades the process <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image {{formation}} occurred as a significant part in tourism research. Although many researchers have greatly contributed to this important research field, still several aspects <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image are not well understood and require attention. Level <b>of</b> satisfaction, <b>destination</b> choice decision-making process, after-decision-making behaviours, intention to revisit and willingness to recommend are indisputably dependent on destination image. This paper looks at the concept <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image and the instruments <b>of</b> measuring <b>destination</b> image. In particular, the process <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image formation and the factors that shape the destination image is highlighted. Afterwards, a short review of the ECC Event and a literature review of the methodologies existing in the literature regarding measurement <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image are presented. Finally, the research methodology that will be implemented in the measurement of the image improvement of Linz during the ECC Event in 2009 is shortly described. The rationale for undertaking this study is to provoke discussions whether the successful measurement <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image requires the implementation of both qualitative and quantitative approaches, wherein the qualitative approach precedes the quantitative method. Moreover, the combination of structured and unstructured methods presents a unique opportunity to analyse the multidimensional character <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image.
