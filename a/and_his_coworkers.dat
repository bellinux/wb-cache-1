5|$|Altair {{is one of}} the few {{stars for}} which a direct image has been obtained. In 2006 and 2007, J. D. Monnier <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>coworkers</b> {{produced}} an image of Altair's surface from 2006 infrared observations made with the MIRC instrument on the CHARA array interferometer; this was the first time the surface of any main-sequence star, apart from the Sun, had been imaged. The false-color image was published in 2007. The equatorial radius of the star was estimated to be 2.03 solar radii, and the polar radius 1.63 solar radii—a 25% increase of the stellar radius from pole to equator. The polar axis is inclined by about 60° to the line of sight from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} work of J. D. Brown and Marc Henneaux in 1986, {{physicists}} have noticed that quantum gravity in a three-dimensional spacetime is closely related to two-dimensional conformal field theory. In 1995, Henneaux <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>coworkers</b> explored this relationship in more detail, suggesting that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to the conformal field theory known as Liouville field theory. Another conjecture formulated by Edward Witten states that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to a conformal field theory with monster group symmetry. These conjectures provide examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence that do not require the full apparatus of string or M-theory.|$|E

Murphy was lightly wounded and arrested by the RUC. The incident caused outrage among South Armagh residents, provided the IRA with many new recruits and created a hostile climate where local people were prepared to tolerate the killing of security force members.|$|R
25|$|On August 27, {{they were}} finally ready. The theatre was showing the opera Parsifal by Richard Wagner. Susini <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>coworkers</b> {{had set up}} a 5W {{transmitter}} on the roof using a RS-5 Telefunken tube, operating in 350m, along with a wire antenna connected to the dome on top of a neighboring building.

25|$|The first {{practical}} application for piezoelectric devices was sonar, first developed during World War I. In France in 1917, Paul Langevin <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>coworkers</b> developed an ultrasonic submarine detector. The detector {{consisted of a}} transducer, made of thin quartz crystals carefully glued between two steel plates, and a hydrophone to detect the returned echo. By emitting a high-frequency pulse from the transducer, and measuring {{the amount of time}} it takes to hear an echo from the sound waves bouncing off an object, one can calculate the distance to that object.|$|E
25|$|The ban on Sati, {{effected}} by Lord William Bentinck in 1829, was {{largely due to}} the efforts of both Christian and Hindu reformers such as William Carey and Ram Mohan Roy. In 1799 Carey, a Baptist missionary from England, first witnessed the burning of a widow on her husband’s funeral pyre. Horrified by the practice, Carey <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>coworkers</b> Joshua Marshman and William Ward opposed sati from that point onward, lobbying for its abolishment. Known as the Serampore Trio, they published essays forcefully condemning the practice and presented an address against Sati to then Governor General of India, Lord Wellesley.|$|E

25|$|Conversion of {{vegetable}} oil to biodiesel is via a transesterification reaction, where the triglyceride {{is converted to}} the methyl ester plus glycerol. This is usually done using methanol and caustic or acid catalysts, but can be achieved using supercritical methanol without a catalyst. The method of using supercritical methanol for biodiesel production was first studied by Saka <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>coworkers.</b> This {{has the advantage of}} allowing a greater range and water content of feedstocks (in particular, used cooking oil), the product {{does not need to be}} washed to remove catalyst, and is easier to design as a continuous process.|$|E
25|$|L-DOPA {{crosses the}} {{protective}} blood–brain barrier, whereas dopamine itself cannot. Thus, L-DOPA {{is used to}} increase dopamine concentrations {{in the treatment of}} Parkinson's disease and dopamine-responsive dystonia. This treatment was made practical and proven clinically by George Cotzias <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>coworkers,</b> for which they won the 1969 Lasker Prize. Once L-DOPA has entered the central nervous system, it is converted into dopamine by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, also known as DOPA decarboxylase. Pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6) is a required cofactor in this reaction, and may occasionally be administered along with L-DOPA, usually in the form of pyridoxine.|$|E

One day, Shion <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>coworker</b> discover the body of an apparently old man in the park. When the man's death is not reported in the news, and Shion finds out that the body belonged to a man only 31 years old, he becomes suspicious of a government cover-up. Shion later witnesses <b>his</b> <b>coworker</b> age rapidly <b>and</b> die as a wasp emerge from his neck. Shion is then arrested under the pretense of being suspected for murdering <b>his</b> <b>coworker.</b> Nezumi saves him from the authorities and takes him to West Block, the slums outside the city. Shion nearly dies himself when he is infected with a parasitic wasp, but Nezumi saves him a second time, though Shion is left with white hair and a scar {{that looks like a}} red snake curling from his ankle to his neck.

Workers in factories producing Apple products have also been exposed to n-hexane, a neurotoxin that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products.|$|E
25|$|Using these data, he {{quantified}} radical {{loss from}} particles, showing that simple diffusion theory {{could explain the}} results. Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>coworkers</b> then revealed the mechanism for initiation in emulsion polymerisation by the entry of radicals into particles—in terms of fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic precepts—in a theory that clarifies the process as being through production of surface-active species in the water phase. This model produced various qualitative predictions. One prediction, that of {{the independence of the}} entry-rate coefficient of the size and surface properties of particles, was widely seen as counterintuitive because of the deep-rooted belief in models that he had shown to be wrong. Subsequently, this prediction was experimentally verified by Gilbert and others. He used the understanding from this knowledge to develop a priori models for particle formation and molecular-weight distribution.|$|E
25|$|The eigenstates are {{obtained}} by diagonalizing this matrix. This gives new eigenvectors, {{which we can}} call K1 which {{is the sum of}} the two states of opposite strangeness, and K2, which is the difference. The two are eigenstates of CP with opposite eigenvalues; K1 has CP=+1, and K2 has CP=−1 Since the two-pion final state also has CP=+1, only the K1 can decay this way. The K2 must decay into three pions. Since the mass of K2 is just a little larger than the sum of the masses of three pions, this decay proceeds very slowly, about 600 times slower than the decay of K1 into two pions. These two different modes of decay were observed by Leon Lederman <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>coworkers</b> in 1956, establishing the existence of the two weak eigenstates (states with definite lifetimes under decays via the weak force) of the neutral kaons.|$|E
25|$|Gamma rays {{were first}} {{thought to be}} {{particles}} with mass, like alpha and beta rays. Rutherford initially believed {{that they might be}} extremely fast beta particles, but their failure to be deflected by a magnetic field indicated that they had no charge. In 1914, gamma rays were observed to be reflected from crystal surfaces, proving that they were electromagnetic radiation. Rutherford <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>coworker</b> Edward Andrade measured the wavelengths of gamma rays from radium, and found that they were similar to X-rays, but with shorter wavelengths and (thus) higher frequency. This was eventually recognized as giving them also more energy per photon, as soon as the latter term became generally accepted. A gamma decay was then understood to usually emit a single gamma photon.|$|R
