5|$|Access to {{the park}} by {{tourists}} improved {{in the early years}} of the park, and conditions in the Valley were made more hospitable. Tourism significantly increased after the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, but the long horseback ride to reach the area was <b>a</b> <b>deterrent.</b> Three stagecoach roads were built in the mid-1870s to provide better access for the growing number of visitors to Yosemite Valley.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocus {{is among}} the most easily {{identifiable}} dinosaurs, with its typical sauropod shape, long neck and tail, and four sturdy legs. For many years, it was the longest dinosaur known. Its great size may have been <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> to the predators Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus: their remains have been found in the same strata, which suggests that they coexisted with Diplodocus.|$|E
5|$|Elective safeties {{are more}} common in Canadian football, where they can result in better field {{position}} than a punt. The 2010 Edmonton Eskimos surrendered a Canadian Football League (CFL)-record 14 safeties, a factor that led CFL reporter Jim Mullin to suggest increasing {{the value of the}} safety touch from two to three points as <b>a</b> <b>deterrent.</b>|$|E

5|$|The long horseback {{ride from}} Merced {{remained}} <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> to tourists. Three stagecoach roads {{were built in}} the mid-1870s to provide better access; Coulterville Road (June 1874), Big Oak Flat Road (July 1874), and the Wawona Road (July 1875). A road to Glacier Point was completed in 1882 by John Conway, and the Great Sierra Wagon Road was opened in 1883, which roughly followed the Mono Trail to Tuolumne Meadows.|$|E
5|$|Aside from a {{comprehensive}} modernization in 1929–31, Arizona was regularly used for training exercises between the wars, including the annual Fleet Problems (training exercises). When an earthquake struck Long Beach, California, on March 10, 1933, the Arizonas crew provided {{aid to the}} survivors. In July 1934, the ship was featured in a Jimmy Cagney film, Here Comes the Navy, about the romantic troubles of a sailor. In April 1940, she {{and the rest of}} the Pacific Fleet were transferred from California to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, as <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> to Japanese imperialism.|$|E
5|$|Bani Na'im grew {{considerably}} in population {{during the early}} 20th century. In 1936, the town participated in the Arab revolt against the British authorities. In December 1937, British forces ordered the demolition of a house whose owners were accused of involvement in an anti-British incident near the town. They fined Bani Na'im's mukhtars (town chiefs) 50 British pounds and ordered the residents to carry 200 kilograms of explosives to the building for its demolition and watch the explosion as <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> measure.|$|E

5|$|Birds are a {{significant}} hazard to aircraft, {{but it is difficult}} to keep them away from airfields. Several methods have been explored. Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, and it may be possible to reduce their numbers on airfields by reducing the number of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Bloomsbury {{invested}} £10million in {{an attempt}} to keep the book's contents secure until 21 July, the release date. Arthur Levine, U.S. editor of the Harry Potter series, denied distributing any copies of Deathly Hallows in advance for press review, but two U.S. papers published early reviews anyway. There was speculation that some shops would break the embargo and distribute copies of the book early, as the penalty imposed for previous instalments—that the distributor would not be supplied with any further copies of the series—would no longer be <b>a</b> <b>deterrent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{location}} near the beachfront, the station roof's solar panels {{needed to meet}} stringent hurricane standards, and as such, the panels for the station were rigorously tested in a laboratory in York, Pennsylvania. It is the New York City Subway's first solar-powered subway station. The solar panels are expected to last for at least 35 years, and a catwalk is located below the roof if any solar panel replacements were ever needed. As a bonus feature, a low voltage current, which is emitted from the panels, serves as <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> against pigeons.|$|E

5|$|Once in Buenos Aires, Castelli {{found himself}} in {{political}} isolation. The triumvirate and the newspaper La Gazeta blamed him for the defeat at Huaqui, and sought punishment as <b>a</b> <b>deterrent.</b> His former supporters were divided between those who supported {{the ideas of the}} Triumvirate and those no longer able to help. Castelli suffered from tongue cancer during the long trial, which made it progressively more difficult for him to speak. He died on October 12, 1812, while the trial was still underway.|$|E
5|$|Some {{truck drivers}} use the pass despite the prohibition. They are {{generally}} either {{unaware of the}} restriction and following routes plotted by their GPS devices, or aware of it and willing to risk the fine {{for the sake of}} the time and distance saved. The resulting accidents have sometimes forced the closure of the pass. CDOT put up larger signs advising drivers of the ban and worked with GPS device manufacturers so their software notes the restriction. Aspen officials have suggested increasing the fines as <b>a</b> <b>deterrent.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of Harriers did not see further combat with the RAF after the Falklands War, although they continued to serve for years afterwards. As <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> against further Argentine invasion attempts, No. 1453 Flight RAF was deployed to the Falkland Islands from August 1983 to June 1985. However the second generation Harrier IIs saw action in Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The {{first generation}} Hawker Siddeley airframes were replaced by the improved Harrier II, which had been developed jointly between McDonnell Douglas and British Aerospace.|$|E

5|$|According to Croatian {{political}} scientist Vladimir Filipović, {{it is unclear}} whether the limited resources earmarked for the operation and the unclear motivation of CANBAT 1 troops would stop several HV brigades; according to Hague, the plan did not indicate how CANBAT 1 or the other elements of the UNPROFOR would retreat through Croatia after such a clash. Hague questioned the feasibility of Operation Backstop, because the advance-warning requirement was considered impossible to meet. The UNPROFOR had no reliable military intelligence on HV movements outside the UNPAs, or beyond -wide zones around the UNPAs (where only United Nations Military Observers were present). However, Hague considered Operation Backstop <b>a</b> <b>deterrent.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{sea trials}} in early 1941, Tirpitz briefly {{served as the}} centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet, which was intended to prevent a possible break-out attempt by the Soviet Baltic Fleet. In early 1942, the ship sailed to Norway to act as <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> against an Allied invasion. While stationed in Norway, Tirpitz was also intended {{to be used to}} intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union, and two such missions were attempted in 1942. This was the only feasible role for her, since the St Nazaire Raid had made operations against the Atlantic convoy lanes too risky. Tirpitz acted as a fleet in being, forcing the British Royal Navy to retain significant naval forces in the area to contain the battleship.|$|E
5|$|After the United States was {{attacked}} at Pearl Harbor on December7, 1941 by Japanese forces, it entered World War II {{to join the}} Allied forces in their fight against the Axis powers. American forces led by General Douglas MacArthur, already stationed in the Philippines as <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> against a Japanese invasion of the islands, were attacked by the Japanese hours after Pearl Harbor. On March12, 1942, General MacArthur and a few select officers, on the orders of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, left the American forces, promising to return with reinforcements. The 72,000 soldiers of the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), fighting with outdated weapons, lacking supplies, and stricken with disease and malnourishment, eventually surrendered to the Japanese on April 9, 1942.|$|E

50|$|It {{is rarely}} {{cultivated}} but an easy plant to grow provided {{it has a}} sunny aspect. Unlike many other proteaceae it can be tolerant of poor drainage. Its extremely prickly foliage can make <b>a</b> good <b>deterrent.</b> When planted in clumps, this species provides an excellent shelter for small birds such as superb fairywrens (Malurus superbus) and the smaller sized honeyeaters. It can also prove <b>a</b> prickly <b>deterrent</b> for burglars.|$|R
50|$|The state {{contended that}} while the use of capital {{punishment}} served no rehabilitating purposes, it was a legitimate punishment for retribution in serious offenses, in that it served to isolate the offender, and was <b>a</b> useful <b>deterrent</b> to crime.

5|$|Because {{of their}} status as the largest {{warships}} in the U.S. Navy, the deployment of an aircraft carrier can fulfill a symbolic role, not {{just in terms of}} <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> to an enemy, but often as a diplomatic tool, in strengthening relations with allies and potential allies. The latter of these functions can take place either as a single visit to a country, in which senior naval officers are allowed to observe the operating of the carrier and to interact with its senior officers, or as part of an international task force. This can be in combat operations, such as NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, or other deployments involving training, such as Exercise RIMPAC. In addition, carriers have participated in international Maritime security operations, combating piracy in the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Somalia.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{pressed to}} reform the state's {{criminal}} code, {{which was based on}} the English system and imposed the death penalty for over 200 different crimes. Inspired by Thomas Jefferson's failed attempt to reform Virginia's code, he first asked the Lexington Democratic Society to study ways to make punishments more proportional to crimes in November 1793. By 1796, he was drafting a new code based on the principles that criminals should be rehabilitated, victims should be compensated for their injury, the public should be reimbursed for the cost of prosecuting the criminal, and the punishment's severity should serve as <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> for would-be offenders. In January 1798, he introduced his proposed code in the General Assembly. A month later, the Assembly reformed the code, abolishing the death penalty for every crime except first-degree murder.|$|E
5|$|In July 1950, {{soon after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 Superfortress bombers to Guam as <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> to a Chinese attack on Taiwan, and possible future use in Korea. They were loaded with Mark 4 nuclear bombs, but without the fissile cores. Travis was one of twenty passengers and crewmen on board B-29 Superfortress 44-87651 when it commenced take off from Fairfield-Suisun at 2200 on 5 August 1950. The plane was piloted by Captain Eugene Q. Steffes, with First Lieutenant Carter W. Johnson as his co-pilot and Technical Sergeant Donald W. Moore as his flight engineer.|$|E
