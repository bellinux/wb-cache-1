5000|$|Once a node {{has been}} found in an <b>AVL</b> <b>tree,</b> the next or {{previous}} node can be accessed in amortized constant time.

However, exploring all [...] nodes of the tree in this manner would visit each link exactly twice: one downward visit to enter the subtree rooted by that node, another visit upward to leave that node’s subtree after having explored it.

50|$|Order-statistic trees can {{be further}} amended with {{bookkeeping}} information to maintain balance (e.g., tree height {{can be added to}} get an order statistic <b>AVL</b> <b>tree,</b> or a color bit to get a red-black order statistic tree).

5000|$|The <b>AVL</b> <b>tree</b> {{is another}} {{structure}} supporting [...] search, insertion, and removal.

40|$|Abstract. Since the {{invention}} of <b>AVL</b> <b>trees</b> in 1962, {{a wide variety of}} ways to balance binary search trees have been proposed. Notable are red-black trees, in which bottom-up rebalancing after an insertion or deletion takes O(1) amortized time and O(1) rotations worst-case. But the design space of balanced trees has not been fully explored. We introduce the rank-balanced tree, a relaxation of <b>AVL</b> <b>trees.</b> Rank-balanced trees can be rebalanced bottom-up after an insertion or deletion in O(1) amortized time and at most two rotations worst-case, in contrast to red-black trees, which need up to three rotations per deletion. Rebalancing can also be done top-down with fixed lookahead in O(1) amortized time. Using a novel analysis that relies on an exponential potential function, we show that both bottom-up and top-down rebalancing modify nodes exponentially infrequently in their heights. ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>AVL</b> <b>trees</b> {{are more}} rigidly {{balanced}} than RB trees with an asymptotic relation ≈0.720 of the maximal heights. For insertions and deletions, Ben Pfaff shows in 79 measurements a relation of [...] between 0.677 and 1.077 with median ≈0.947 and geometric mean ≈0.910.|$|R
40|$|Binary {{search tree}} (BST) based data structures, such as <b>AVL</b> <b>trees,</b> red-black trees, and splay trees, {{are often used}} in system software, such as {{operating}} system kernels. Choosing {{the right kind of}} tree can impact performance significantly, but the literature offers few empirical studies for guidance. We compare 20 BST variants using three experiments in real-world scenarios with real and artificial workloads. The results indicate that when input is expected to be randomly ordered with occasional runs of sorted order, red-black trees are preferred; when insertions often occur in sorted order, <b>AVL</b> <b>trees</b> excel for later random access, whereas splay trees perform best for later sequential or clustered access. For node representations, use of parent pointers is shown to be the fastest choice, with threaded nodes a close second choice that saves memory; nodes without parent pointers or threads suffer when traversal and modification are combined; maintaining a in-order doubly linked list is advantageous when traversal is very common; and right-threaded nodes perform poorly. ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{computer}} science, a WAVL tree or weak <b>AVL</b> <b>tree</b> is a self-balancing {{binary search}} tree. WAVL trees are named after AVL trees, {{another type of}} balanced search tree, and are closely related both to AVL trees and red-black trees, which all fall into a common framework of rank balanced trees.Like other balanced binary search trees, WAVL trees can handle insertion, deletion, and search operations in time [...] per operation.|$|E
50|$|A tree can be {{rebalanced}} using rotations. After a rotation, {{the side}} of the rotation increases its height by 1 whilst the side opposite the rotation decreases its height similarly. Therefore, one can strategically apply rotations to nodes whose left child and right child differ in height by more than 1. Self-balancing binary search trees apply this operation automatically. A type of tree which uses this rebalancing technique is the <b>AVL</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E

50|$|This makes {{scapegoat}} trees {{similar to}} red-black trees {{in that they}} both have restrictions on their height. They differ greatly though in their implementations of determining where the rotations (or {{in the case of}} scapegoat trees, rebalances) take place. Whereas red-black trees store additional 'color' information in each node to determine the location, scapegoat trees find a scapegoat which isn't α-weight-balanced to perform the rebalance operation on. This is loosely similar to <b>AVL</b> <b>trees,</b> in that the actual rotations depend on 'balances' of nodes, but the means of determining the balance differs greatly. Since <b>AVL</b> <b>trees</b> check the balance value on every insertion/deletion, it is typically stored in each node; scapegoat trees are able to calculate it only as needed, which is only when a scapegoat needs to be found.|$|R
