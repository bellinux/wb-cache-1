30|$|The {{acoustic}} {{properties of}} board material are well defined and are gauged {{in terms of}} absorption, reflection, impedance, admittance, and transmission loss. Sound-absorbing materials are those materials designed and used for absorbing sound {{that might otherwise be}} reflected. Sound is absorbed when part of the energy striking a surface or an object is converted into heat energy in the pores of the material. Therefore, sound absorption is described as heat conversion of energy. The sound-absorbing characteristics of <b>acoustical</b> <b>materials</b> vary significantly with frequency. For the vast majority of conventional <b>acoustical</b> <b>materials,</b> material thickness has the greatest influence on the material’s sound-absorbing qualities. The absorption coefficient also varies with the frequency and angle of incidence of the sound. Generally, higher frequencies are more easily absorbed than the low frequencies. Materials that are good absorbers allow sound to pass through them relatively easily. Sound-absorbing materials commonly used in construction include porous materials such as glass wool, gypsum, and similar materials.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Control {{of noise}} {{produced}} by mechanical devices almost always requires {{the use of}} acoustical materials, either individually or in combination. Two types of acoustical materials are available. One type absorbs incident sound waves by converting most of the acoustical energy into minute amounts of heat. A porous structure is required, so that incident sound waves will propagate into the material where viscous flow losses and friction dissipate some of the energy. The remaining acoustical energy is reflected from the structure or transmitted through it. Examples of absorbing materials are ceiling tile, glass fiber mats and boards of all types, and open cell foams. A second type of <b>acoustical</b> <b>material</b> serves as a barrier by attenuating incident sound waves {{from one side to the}} other. By nature, an acoustical absorber is a poor attenuator (or barrier) because too much of the acoustic energy propagates through its porous structure. On the other hand, the dense, nonporo...|$|E
40|$|Systems that {{automatically}} detect voice pathologies are usually trained with recordings belonging to population of all ages. However {{such an approach}} might be inadequate because of the acoustic variations in the voice caused by the natural aging process. In top of that, elder voices present some perturbations in quality similar to those related to voice disorders, which make the detection of pathologies more troublesome. With this in mind, the study of methodologies which automatically incorporate information about speakers’ age, aiming at a simplification in the detection of voice disorders is of interest. In this respect, the present paper introduces an age detector trained with normal and pathological voice, constituting a first step towards the study of age-dependent pathology detectors. The proposed system employs sustained vowels of the Saarbrucken database from which two age groups are examinated: adults and elders.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the feasibility of Arenga Pinnata fiber to be applied for <b>acoustical</b> <b>material</b> component. There different binders namely polyurethane, urea formaldehyde and latex were employed as binder. The weight percentages of binder used were 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %, and 30 %. Hand layup process was used in specimens production. The physical, acoustical and durability properties of the panels were investigated experimentally. The result shows that panel with high percentages of binder tends to have high density and tortuosity, but less porosity. The optimum porosity of 0. 94 was obtained from panel that added with 10 % Latex. In general, Arenga Pinnata panels show good sound absorption from mid to high frequency that is from 2000 Hz to 5000 Hz. The best sound absorption is performed by panel added with 10 % Latex with a maximum absorption coefficient (α) of 0. 96 at 3000 Hz. The average Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC) for all panels is 0. 40. The value indicates that Arenga Pinnata panels are highly absorptive material. However, Arenga Pinnata panel is poor insulator since the optimum sound transmission loss (STL) is only 9. 37 dB from panel added with 15 % polyurethane at 5000 Hz. Thus, Arenga Pinnata panel is applicable to reduce echo caused by reflection effects within a room. Sound absorption increases as porosity increase and decrease as density-tortuosity increase. Hence, Arenga pinnata fiber is applicable for acoustical component panel. Moreover, Arenga Pinnata panels are durable that resist in water, heat, and fire. It is applicable for heat insulation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{reduction}} of CO 2 emission as the greenhouse gas emitted {{in the largest}} volume due to human activities has become a primary focus in the last decade. Generally, in CO 2 gas purification technologies using chemical/physical absorption, the regeneration of solvent is carried out on high temperature and low pressure. This process is quite energy intensive and solvent consuming due to the evaporation loss. The ultrasonic insonation of the solution as a pioneering degassing operation promotes the developing of gas bubbles via rectified diffusion. In the physical models appeared in literature, {{the effect of the}} dissolution process on the bubble dynamics is usually neglected due to the different order of magnitudes of the respective timescales. This allows of using constant bubble mass in the equation of motion. Our investigated cases correspond to three different drive frequencies with both coupling and decoupling model settings. Numerical calculations are carried out for an adiabatic CO 2 microbubble by applying a spectral collocation method with Chebyshev polynomials. The obtained results pointed out an enhancement of the rectified diffusion rate by increase of the acoustical frequency at certain pressure amplitude. In addition, the damping effect of the mass diffusion process on the eigen-frequencies can be established in case of subharmonic- and close-to resonance cases.

The approach consisted of performing scale-model experiments in a laboratory environment and developing corresponding boundary element models. Field measurements were also performed in order to confirm the findings of the scale-model experiments and numerical studies. First, the simple geometry was chosen to validate the use of boundary element models for the prediction of scattered diffraction. More complicated geometries were investigated to study the effects of geometry on sound barrier performance. The performance of straight-edge barriers with various top geometries and sound absorptive treatments was then investigated. Experiments were performed using a finite-size barrier in an anechoic chamber. The results confirmed that a sound absorptive treatment near the edge has a performance advantage over corresponding rigid barriers. A design optimization study of the most effective shape of acoustical treatments concluded that a circular shape works best. The performance of two different <b>acoustical</b> <b>materials</b> was also compared. The results from the boundary element model agree well with the experimental results up to 6300 Hz.

Boundary element models for barriers with sound absorptive edges were created using a multi-domain formulation by prescribing a complex sound speed and density. It was found that the multi-domain numerical model could be used to predict diffraction phenomena through and around the absorptive material, and can therefore be used to identify the sound absorptive top geometry and material properties that yield optimal barrier performance.

Also, an evaluation of acoustical enclosures was carried out to determine if they were an effective way to reduce the sound from gear-boxes and actuators that currently actuate the line of animatronic toys made by the client. Several actuation methods and enclosure materials were considered and evaluated based upon their performance, relative quietness, and their viability in the application into animatronic toys. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons were made of each of the actuation methods and were eliminated based upon their ability to satisfy the design constraints based upon their safety, acoustical performance, and ability to reproduce the life-like characteristics of the toys.

The equivalent density ρ_eq(ω) and bulk modulus K_eq(ω) of the porous medium are then analytically recovered from measurements. A numerical inversion procedure using the least square method allows us to obtain a good estimation of the five following acoustical parameters: the porosity ϕ, the tortuosity α_∞, the flow resistivity σ, the viscous characteristic length Λ and the thermal characteristic length Λ'...|$|R
