40|$|Mycobacterium haemophilum is an uncommonly {{encountered}} <b>acid-fast</b> staining <b>bacillus</b> (AFB) {{that can}} cause {{a broad range of}} infections. We describe a tertiary care center's experience with M. haemophilum infections identified from 2000 to 2015. Ten adult patients were identified with M. haemophilum infections, and most had immunocompromising conditions. M. haemophilum presented in one of two syndromes: a peripheral cutaneous infection presenting with skin nodularity and local invasion, and a cervicofacial infection involving regional lymph nodes. Duration of therapy was variable (0 â 18 months) and was dependent on the underlying syndrome and immunological status of the patient. Treatment responses were favorable in all patients. During therapy, three patients developed culture-negative aseptic cutaneous lesions, consistent with immunologic reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS); we postulate that such reactions may not be uncommon with select M. haemophilum infections.

40|$|Abstract. A 2. 5 -year-old captive female {{mandrill}} (Papio sphinx) died {{following a}} protracted course of intermittent abdominal bloat, diarrhea, and severe weight loss. Necropsy revealed emaciation and marked gas-trointestinal distention with gas and ingesta. Histologic evaluation revealed severe diffuse granulomatous en-terocolitis and mesenteric lymphadenitis with massive numbers of 1 – 2 -m acid-fast bacilli within macrophages. Additionally, there was {{moderate to severe}} multifocal myocardial and vascular amyloidosis, moderate multifocal pyogranulomatous interstitial pneumonia with no acid-fast bacteria, and moderate multifocal glossal candidiasis. Samples of feces, ileum, and colon were positive for Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis by radio-metric culture and a polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA probe specific for the insertion sequence IS 900 of this organism.

40|$|ObjectivesOur {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} contribution of endobronchial ultrasound in the diagnostic yields of <b>acid-fast</b> <b>bacillus</b> smear, nucleic acid amplification tests, and culture in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for pulmonary tuberculosis. MethodsDuring a 1 -year interval, 99 patients who had initial sputum-negative <b>acid-fast</b> <b>bacillus</b> smears or no sputum but were later proven to have a positive culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in their sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were retrospectively studied. Among them, 56 patients underwent bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS group) and 43 patients received conventional bronchoscopy for bronchoalveolar lavage (non-EBUS group). ResultsThe diagnostic yields of the nucleic acid amplification tests (89. 3 %, 50 / 56; P = . 006), <b>acid-fast</b> <b>bacillus</b> smear (30. 4 %, 17 / 56; P = . 013), and M tuberculosis culture in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (67. 9 %, 38 / 56; P = . 041) were significantly higher in the EBUS group of patients. The results of those who underwent conventional bronchoscopy were 65. 1 % (28 / 43), 9. 3 % (4 / 43), and 46. 5 % (20 / 43), respectively. Combining bronchoalveolar lavage fluid smear and nucleic acid amplification tests, we made a rapid diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in 51 (91. 1 %) of the 56 EBUS patients and 29 (67. 4 %; P = . 004) of the 43 non-EBUS patients.
