500|$|Along with The Dark Knight Returns, Tim Burton has {{mentioned}} that The Killing Joke influenced his film adaptation of Batman: [...] "I {{was never a}} giant comic book fan, but I've <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan — and I think it started when I was a child — is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't {{know if it was}} dyslexia or whatever, but that's why I loved The Killing Joke, because for the first time I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable." ...|$|E
500|$|The main four cast {{originally}} {{signed a}} three-movie deal, [...] with Fox Studios and Julian McMahon also signed {{for a third}} film. Michael Chiklis was told Ben Grimm's relationship with Alicia Masters {{would have had a}} greater focus in a third film and Jessica Alba expressed interest in introducing Franklin Richards, while Beau Garrett wished to return as Nova. Tim Story said he was interested in directing a third and fourth film and writer Don Payne stated while he had not discussed a sequel with the studio, he was interested in working with more Fantastic Four characters saying [...] "I’ve <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> Inhumans, the Skrulls, the Puppet Master, and Annihilus and the Negative Zone". As Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer performed less at the box office than the first film, 20th Century Fox was unsure of the series' future, and no script was in development. [...] In March 2008, Chris Evans revealed, [...] "I'm pretty sure we won’t do another one. I’m assuming that one is a closed book." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna worked {{primarily}} with Orbit after Guy Oseary, Maverick Records's partner, phoned Orbit {{and suggested that}} he send some songs to the singer. He sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to Madonna, and [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was among these tracks. It {{is based on the}} track [...] "Sepheryn" [...] (1971), by English folk music duo Curtiss Maldoon (consisting of Dave Curtiss and Clive Maldoon). In 1996, English singer and songwriter Christine Leach, Maldoon's niece, had recorded her version of the track. Leach said she had <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> duo's work and [...] "Sepheryn" [...] was her favorite. She worked for a time with Orbit and recorded a demo of [...] "Sepheryn" [...] over a melody on which he was working. Leach rewrote the chorus and also removed a few bits from the original composition. Orbit included it in the DAT thinking that Leach had written the song. After Madonna heard the demo she liked it, and reworked the lyrics to create [...] "Ray of Light".|$|E
500|$|The game's playable character, William [...] "B.J." [...] Blazkowicz, {{has been}} {{previously}} featured as the playable protagonist of all Wolfenstein games. When developing the character of Blazkowicz for The New Order, MachineGames considered his appearances in previous games in the series. When doing this, they realised that the character had never really developed at all throughout the games; [...] "He's just the guy that you play," [...] said Pete Hines, Vice President of PR and Marketing for Bethesda. The team discovered that {{they were interested in}} exploring his story, which is what they later invested in. One particular scenario that the team envisioned is putting Blazkowicz in situations where he is uncomfortable. Matthies said, [...] "that's really interesting to me. I love taking things and making them real." [...] Throughout the game, Blazkowicz communicates some of his inner thoughts through short monologues, many of which reveal that he has been traumatized by some of his experiences. [...] "We <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> idea of a prototypical action hero exterior juxtaposed with a rich and vulnerable interior psychology," [...] said Matthies. One of the largest priorities for the team when developing the character of Blazkowicz was to [...] "reveal whatever needs to be revealed to [...] and the player" [...] simultaneously; Matthies felt that, despite the simplicity of this concept, it is rarely used in games. Prior to developing The New Order, the team had primarily worked on games that involved antihero protagonists. However, id Software wished Blazkowicz to be portrayed differently in the game. Matthies said, [...] "It's really important to [...] that BJ is a hero, and not an anti-hero." [...] The team attempted to develop Blazkowicz into a character that players could relate to, as they felt that players are generally unable to relate to video game protagonists. [...] "The goal is not to have a protagonist that's so neutral that you can project yourself into them; the goal is to have a protagonist that is so relatable that you become them," [...] said Matthies. They also tried to make players become [...] "emotionally in sync" [...] with Blazkowicz, using the morality choice in the game's prologue to do so.|$|E
2500|$|Dale {{told the}} Duluth News Tribune in 2009 that, [...] "The {{difference}} {{between the two of us}} is that Alan is a dreamer, and he's extremely aggressive in what he wants. I'm far more conservative than he is, and I've <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> hands-on stuff"; and Alan told Airport Journals in 2006 that, [...] "Dale is more practical —unbelievably practical, in fact. Dale figures out how to make [...] work." ...|$|E

5000|$|Before the record's release, {{there was}} {{originally}} {{a batch of}} 40 songs prepared as possible tracks.

2500|$|... "I've <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> Australian {{countryside}} and the irony about {{being involved with}} music is that now it has drawn me into these big studios in the big city. Of course people will still make sincere music and great sounds wherever they might be. In the end what counts is what's in their hearts but I, myself, am very affected by my surrounds. Definitely some of our more fun gigs {{have been in the}} bush." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rubenstein {{called his}} two Dune miniseries [...] "science fiction {{for people who}} don't ordinarily like science fiction" [...] and {{suggested}} that [...] "the Dune saga tends to appeal to women {{in part because it}} features powerful female characters". Actress Sarandon agreed, saying [...] "One of the reasons I <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> books was because they were driven by strong women, living outside the rules." [...] She added that the Dune series [...] "is very apropos to some of what's {{going on in the world}} today. It's about the dangers of fundamentalism and the idea that absolute power corrupts." [...] Sarandon said of portraying Wensicia, [...] "it's always fun to play a smart villain." ...|$|E
2500|$|The palace is {{most famous}} though {{for the role}} it played in {{the reign of the}} last tsar, Nicholas II. He and his wife Alexandra Feodorovna <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> palace and decided to make it their {{permanent}} residence after the Bloody Sunday which made the Winter Palace dangerous for them. They remodeled the former two-story ballroom into the Maple Room and the New Study and added rooms for their children on the floor above. To the horror of the court, Alexandra, and her architect Meltzer, chose a then-modern style of decoration, Jugendstil or Art Nouveau, considered by the aristocracy to be [...] "middle class" [...] and less than [...] "Imperial". [...] One of these most famous rooms is Alexandra's Mauve Room [...]|$|E

5000|$|Rollnson has {{a talent}} for rapidly {{designing}} putters for players on the PGA Tour, including when they face trouble with using one during a tournament. He noted in a profile on golf.com, [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> Friday afternoon fire drill." [...] When Phil Mickelson showed an interest to try out the Sabertooth belly putter used by Keegan Bradley, Rollinson made him a new putter over a weekend.|$|R

60|$|But {{it is when}} {{he deals}} with a sinner that Christ is most romantic, {{in the sense of}} most real. The world had <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> saint as being the nearest {{possible}} approach to the perfection of God. Christ, through some divine instinct in him, seems to have <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> sinner as being the nearest possible approach to the perfection of man. His primary desire was not to reform people, any more than his primary desire was to a relieve suffering. To turn an interesting thief into a tedious honest man was not his aim. He would have thought little of the Prisoners' Aid Society and other modern movements of the kind. The conversion of a publican into a Pharisee would not have seemed to him a great achievement. But in a manner not yet understood of the world he regarded sin and suffering as being in themselves beautiful holy things and modes of perfection.|$|E
60|$|Anderson had <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> open, and {{he wanted}} {{a place where he}} could see the sun rise over the distant valley gateway, and watch it set beyond the bold black range in the west.

But from the back porch no eye could have encompassed the limit of his broad, swelling slopes of grain and grass.|$|E
60|$|If Syme {{had been}} able to see himself, he would have {{realised}} that he, too, seemed to be for the first time himself and no one else. For if the Secretary stood for that philosopher who <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> original and formless light, Syme was a type of the poet who seeks always to make the light in special shapes, to split it up into sun and star. The philosopher may sometimes <b>love</b> <b>the</b> infinite; <b>the</b> poet <b>always</b> <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> finite. For him the great moment is not the creation of light, but the creation of the sun and moon.|$|R

5000|$|After Rousseau's Emile had outraged the French {{parliament}}, {{an arrest}} order was issued by parliament against him, {{causing him to}} flee to Switzerland. Subsequently, when the Swiss authorities also proved unsympathetic to him—condemning both Emile, and also The Social Contract—Voltaire issued an invitation to Rousseau to come and reside with him, commenting that: [...] "I shall <b>always</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> author of the 'Vicaire savoyard' whatever he has done, and whatever he may do...Let him come here Ferney!
