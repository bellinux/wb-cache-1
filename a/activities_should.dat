5|$|The {{level of}} greening—strategic, quasi-strategic, or tactical—dictates what <b>activities</b> <b>should</b> be {{undertaken}} by a company. Strategic greening {{in one area}} {{may or may not}} be leveraged effectively in others. A firm could make substantial changes in production processes but opt not to leverage them by positioning itself as an environmental leader. So although strategic greening is not necessarily strategically integrated into all marketing activities, it is nevertheless strategic in the product area.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} {{unresolved}} {{questions concerning the}} definition of work: in particular, whether unpaid endeavors, such as volunteering or studying, are work. Non-work time should not be equated with free time, as it comprises not only free time, dedicated to leisure, but also time dedicated to certain obligatory activities, such as housework. Dividing activities into free and dedicated time is not easy. For example, brushing one's teeth is neither work nor leisure; scholars differ in their classifications of activities such as eating a meal, shopping, repairing a car, attending a religious ceremony, or showering (various individuals {{may or may not}} classify such activities as leisure). The relation between work and leisure can also be unclear: research indicates that some individuals find skills that they have acquired at work useful to their hobbies (and vice versa), and some individuals have used leisure activities to advance their work careers. Sociologists also disagree as to whether political or spiritual <b>activities</b> <b>should</b> be included in studies of leisure. Further, among some occupational communities, such as police officers or miners, it is common for work colleagues to be off-time friends and to share similar, work-based leisure activities.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, the Home Office Policy Advisory Committee's Working Party report, Age of Consent in Relation to Sexual Offences, {{recommended}} that the age of consent for same-sex sexual <b>activities</b> <b>should</b> be reduced from 21 to 18, but no such legislation was enacted as a result.|$|E

25|$|The law, however, {{emphasizes}} that an institution's CRA <b>activities</b> <b>should</b> be undertaken {{in a safe}} and sound manner, and does not require institutions to make high-risk loans that may bring losses to the institution. An institution's CRA compliance record is taken into account by the banking regulatory agencies when the institution seeks to expand through merger, acquisition or branching. The law does not mandate any other penalties for non-compliance with the CRA.|$|E
25|$|The {{failure of}} the 1215 {{invasion}} {{and the death of}} Domnall Bán in no way ended the efforts of the MacWilliams to prosecute their claims to Moray and to the throne of Scotland. Gille Escoib (or Gillescop) Meic Uilleim and his sons were actively in rebellion in the 1220s. Gille Escoib's descent is nowhere stated, and he may have been a son of Domnall, or, more probably given his dates, a grandson. Walter Bower may be incorrect in dating Gille Escoib's rebellion to 1223, and it is more probably in the period around 1228 that his <b>activities</b> <b>should</b> be placed.|$|E
25|$|After the war {{the work}} {{continued}} with addition of minor buildings {{such as the}} porter’s lodge and the enclosure wall. During that time the architects, in collaboration with teachers and students from the Bauhaus, designed the interiors and furniture of the main building. They also recommended to Benscheidt various designers for the publicity campaign of Fagus. From 1923 to 1925, the architects were also {{working on a new}} expansion, but this never took place. It was not until 1927 that Benscheidt wrote to Gropius to explain that all <b>activities</b> <b>should</b> stop until further notice due to financial difficulties.|$|E

25|$|Governmental {{intervention}} can aid {{in encouraging}} private landowners to create habitat or otherwise increase biodiversity on their land. The United States' Endangered Species Act requires landowners to halt any activities negatively affecting endangered species on their land, {{which is a}} disincentive for them to encourage endangered species to settle on their land in the first place. To help mediate this problem, the US Fish and Wildlife Service has instituted safe harbor agreements whereby the landowner engages in restoration on their land to encourage endangered species, and the government agrees not to place further regulation on their <b>activities</b> <b>should</b> they want to reverse the restoration at a later date. This practice has already led {{to an increase in}} aplomado falcons (Falco femoralis) in Texas and red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) in the Southeastern US.|$|E
500|$|At Tabak's trial, prosecuting {{barrister}} Nigel Lickley QC, {{argued that}} the evidence of Tabak's <b>activities</b> <b>should</b> be provided to the jury: [...] "It might {{shed light on the}} need to hold a woman for long enough and the need to squeeze hard enough to take her life." [...] Details of Tabak's viewing of pornography {{were not included in the}} prosecution's case since the judge believed it did not prove that Tabak had acted with premeditation.|$|E
500|$|In 1994, {{the brigade}} was {{selected}} as one of fifteen [...] "enhanced" [...] separate brigades of the Army National Guard, featuring authorization to recruit 10% above required manning levels and a requirement to attend one of the Combat Training Centers not less than once every eight years, and ready to deploy within 90 days in case of emergencies. In 1997, the brigade was integrated under the command structure of the 7th Infantry Division, allowing the 7th Division to provide oversight {{and support for the}} brigade's <b>activities</b> <b>should</b> it be deployed, and potentially command and control when deployed, but that was never tested. In 1996, the brigade's garrison was relocated back to Oklahoma City.|$|E

2500|$|The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation's Secretary General said, [...] "Bin Laden ... was {{responsible}} for many unjustified bloodshed and attacks against innocent civilians", and emphasized the OIC's condemnation of terrorism. He stated the necessity of bringing terrorists to justice, but said that counter-terrorism <b>activities</b> <b>should</b> focus on the causes of terrorism.|$|E
2500|$|The report {{expected}} that the CIA would become the “central organization of the national intelligence system” through creating a community-wide intelligence review board and leading covert activities. It recommended the CIA create “within the agency at the top echelon an evaluation board or section composed of competent and experienced personnel who would have no administrative responsibilities and whose duties would be confined solely to intelligence evaluation.” [...] Eberstadt's task force felt this was necessary because the highest administrators within the CIA had little time to evaluate intelligence. This evaluation board would answer directly to the Director of Central Intelligence but would only have advisory status. Believing responsibility for covert <b>activities</b> <b>should</b> fall under one entity, the Eberstadt Report stated the CIA, under supervision of the National Security Council, should lead such operations, unless in time of war. In time of war, the report recommended responsibility for covert <b>activities</b> <b>should</b> switch to {{the control of the}} Joint Chief of Staff.|$|E

2500|$|To promote art and literature, Islamic Development Organization {{was founded}} by Ayatollah Khomeini. In 1991, Ali Khamenei revised the organization's {{structure}} and plans. The plan is to promote religious and moral ideas through art and literature. According to the Minister of Culture, Hossein Saffar Harandi, the funds for Qur'anic activities would increase by fourfold in the year 2007. [...] "All of the ninth governments' cultural and artistic <b>activities</b> <b>should</b> conform to the Holy Book," [...] he declared.|$|E
2500|$|The Kama Sutra of India {{describes}} {{four different}} kinds of hitting during lovemaking, the allowed regions {{of the human body}} to target and {{different kinds of}} joyful [...] "cries of pain" [...] practiced by bottoms. The collection of historic texts related to sensuous experiences explicitly emphasizes that impact play, biting and pinching during sexual <b>activities</b> <b>should</b> only be performed consensually since only some women consider such behavior to be joyful. From this perspective the Kama Sutra can be considered {{as one of the first}} written resources dealing with sadomasochistic activities and safety rules. Further texts with sadomasochistic connotation appear worldwide during the following centuries on a regular basis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{approach}} to preventing pest infestation has changed {{quite a bit}} in the methodology employed. [...] Where formerly fumigants and pesticides were applied directly to every collection, now more passive and less toxic means of pest management are favored. [...] These newer techniques, termed integrated pest management (IPM), can be just as effective with careful and thorough planning. [...] Different object materials are sensitive to different infestations, so a thorough material understanding of the artifacts to be protected and the pests resident to the area is required. [...] Risks involving the collection building, constructive and decorative materials, and staff <b>activities</b> <b>should</b> be assessed, and a program should then be put in place which reduces these risks.|$|E
