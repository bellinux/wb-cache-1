5|$|Design {{managers}} often {{operate in}} the area of design leadership; however, design management and design leadership are interdependent rather than interchangeable. Like management and leadership, they differ in their objectives, achievements of objectives, accomplishments, <b>and</b> <b>outcomes.</b> Design leadership leads from creation of a vision to changes, innovations, and implementation of creative solutions. It stimulates communication and collaboration through motivation, sets ambitions, and points out future directions to achieve long-term objectives. In contrast, design management is reactive and responds to a given business situation by using specific skills, tools, methods, and techniques. Design management requires design leadership to know where to go and design leadership requires design management to know how to get there.|$|E

Many new treatments were tried, since existing methods for heavy metal poisoning were not particularly effective. Dimercaprol was administered to several patients, but caused rapid deterioration of their condition. It was ruled out {{as a treatment for}} this sort of poisoning following the outbreak. Polythiol resins, penicillamine and dimercaprol sulfonate all helped, but are believed to have been largely insignificant in overall recovery <b>and</b> <b>outcomes.</b> Dialysis was tested on a few patients late in the treatment period, but they showed no clinical improvement. The result of all treatments was varied, with some patients' blood mercury level being dramatically reduced, but a negligible effect in others. All patients received periods of treatment interspersed with lay periods; continuous treatment was suggested in future cases. Later treatment was less effective in reducing blood toxicity.|$|E

40|$|This mixed {{method study}} was {{designed}} to examine preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 culturally responsive teaching self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancy beliefs. Guided by the theoretical and empirical research on self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancy beliefs, <b>and</b> the literature describing the classroom behavior of culturally responsive teachers, two measures—the Culturally Responsive Teaching Self-Efficacy Scale (CRTSE) and the Culturally Responsive Teaching Outcome Expectancy (CRTOE) Scale—were developed and administered to a sample of preservice teachers in the Midwest. The purpose of this mixed methods study was fourfold. First, this study sought {{to examine the relationship between}} preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancy beliefs. Second, it sought to examine the relationship between efficacy <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancy belief patterns and the number of courses taken that addressed issues of cultural diversity and completed practicum requirements. Third, it was designed to examine the factors that influence the formation of preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancy beliefs. Finally, as a follow up to the first phase of the study, the qualitative phase was designed to explore the underlying factors that influence preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancy beliefs. Face-to-face interviews allowed the researcher to identify potential differences between preservice teachers with different self-efficacy/outcome expectancy belief patterns. This study revealed several key findings: (1) preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 culturally responsive teaching self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancy beliefs are highly correlated, (2) there are significant relationships between self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancy belief patterns and the number of courses taken that addressed issues of cultural diversity and the number of completed practicum requirements, and (3) self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancy beliefs are influenced by variables such as color-blind and racial attitudes, coursework, and teacher education major.

40|$|Depression {{has been}} linked to poor health outcome in a number of studies; however, the {{mechanism}} underlying this relationship has received little attention. This paper explores the possibility that adherence mediates the relationship between depression <b>and</b> <b>outcome.</b> Principal findings regarding the relationship between depression, adherence, <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> are reviewed. The data suggest that depression is related, at least moderately, to poorer adherence to a variety of treatment components. The relationship between adherence <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> is more difficult to establish. In addition, current data, albeit limited, do not support the hypothesis that adherence mediates the relationship between depression <b>and</b> <b>outcome.</b> An alternative model in which adherence precedes and influences both mood state <b>and</b> health <b>outcome</b> is discussed. Finally, possible explanations for these relationships are explored and suggestions for future research provided...|$|R

30|$|Moreover, when conceptualizing EO, {{it can be}} of {{importance}} to also consider how EO is operationalized as {{this study suggests that}} process <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> attributes are not necessarily linked.
