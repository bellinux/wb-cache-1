40|$|We {{consider}} bipartite {{systems as}} versatile probes for {{the estimation of}} transformations acting locally {{on one of the}} subsystems. We investigate what resources are required for the probes to offer a guaranteed level of metrological performance, when the latter is averaged over specific sets of local transformations. We quantify such a performance via the <b>average</b> <b>skew</b> information, a convex quantity which we compute in closed form for bipartite states of arbitrary dimensions, and which is shown to be strongly dependent on the degree of local purity of the probes. Our analysis contrasts and complements the recent series of studies focused on the minimum, rather than the average, performance of bipartite probes in local estimation tasks, which was instead determined by quantum correlations other than entanglement. We provide explicit prescriptions to characterize the most reliable states maximizing the <b>average</b> <b>skew</b> information, and elucidate the role of state purity, separability and correlations in the classification of optimal probes. Our results can help in the identification of useful resources for sensing, estimation and discrimination applications when complete knowledge of the interaction mechanism realizing the local transformation is unavailable, and access to pure entangled probes is technologically limited.

40|$|AbstractWe {{argue that}} a {{hexagonal}} grid with simple intermediate nodes is a robust alternative to buffered clock trees typically used for clock distribution in VLSI circuits, multi-core processors, and other applications that require accurate synchronization: Our HEX grid is Byzantine fault-tolerant, self-stabilizing, and seamlessly integrates with multiple synchronized clock sources, as used in multi-synchronous Globally Synchronous Locally Asynchronous (GALS) architectures. Moreover, HEX guarantees a small clock skew between neighbors even for wire delays that are only moderately balanced. We provide both a theoretical analysis of the worst-case skew and simulation results that demonstrate a very small <b>average</b> <b>skew...</b>|$|E

The second algorithm is a multi-pass skew detection and correction algorithm, i. e., the input image is either not rotated or rotated at least once.

40|$|Significant {{compositional}} biases in bacterial chromosomes {{have been}} explained by replication- and transcription-coupled repair mechanisms, the latter causing GC skew {{to indicate the}} direction of repli-cation when gene polarity is correspondingly entrained. Correlations between indicators of replication direction, skew, and transcription polarity are computed for the complete nucleotide sequences of 20 mi-crobial chromosomes and interpreted through statistical tests. A second quantitative method, previously applied to the first complete draft of the Escherichia coli K 12 genome, characterizes the sequences by <b>average</b> <b>skew</b> and net skew due to replication. These methods generally agree in finding the coexistence of replication- and translation-coupled effects and in identifying atypical sequences in which one influence is clearly dominant. The replication-dominated class is exemplified by two chlamydial sequences and the transcription-dominated class by three archaea. The preference for leading-strand transcription in two my-coplasmas is stronger than the skew implies.

40|$|In a {{recently}} developed theory of light diffraction by single striated muscle fibers, we considered only {{the case of}} normal beam incidence. The present investigation represents both an experimental and theoretical extension of the previous work to arbitrary incident angle. Angle scan profiles over a 50 degrees range of incident angle (+ 25 degrees to - 25 degrees) were obtained at different sarcomere lengths. Left and right first-order scan peak separations {{were found to be}} a function of sarcomere length (separation angle = 2 theta B), and good agreement was found between theory and experiment. Our theoretical analysis further showed that a myofibrillar population with a single common skew angle can yield an angle scan profile containing many peaks. Thus, {{it is not necessary to}} associate each peak with a different skew population. Finally, we have found that symmetry angle, theta s, also varies with sarcomere length, but not in a regular manner. Its value at a given sarcomere length is a function of a particular region of a given fiber and represents the <b>average</b> <b>skew</b> angle of all the myofibril populations illuminated. The intensity of a diffraction order line is considered to be principally the resultant of two interference phenomena. The first is a volume-grating phenomenon which results from the periodic A-I band structure of the fiber (with some contribution from Z bands and H zones). The second is Bragg reflection from skew planes, if the correct relation between incident angle and skew angle is met.

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} how the gain of the torsional vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) (defined as the instantaneous eye velocity divided by inverted head velocity) in normal humans {{is affected by}} eye position, target distance, and the plane of head rotation. In six normal subjects we measured three-dimensional (3 D) eye and head rotation axes using scleral search coils, and 6 D head position using a magnetic angular and linear position measurement device, during low-amplitude (∼ 20 °), high-velocity (∼ 200 °/s), high-acceleration (∼ 4000 °/s 2) rapid head rotations or ‘impulses. ’ Head impulses were imposed manually and delivered in five planes: yaw (horizontal canal plane), pitch, roll, left anterior-right posterior canal plane (LARP), and right anterior-left posterior canal plane (RALP). Subjects were instructed to fix on one of six targets at eye level. Targets were either straight-ahead, 20 ° left or 20 ° right from midline, at distance 15 or 124 cm from the subject. Two subjects also looked at more eccentric targets, 30 ° left or 30 ° right from midline. We found that the vertical and horizontal VOR gains increased with {{the proximity of the}} target to the subject. Previous studies suggest that the torsional VOR gain should decrease with target proximity. We found, however, that the torsional VOR gain did not change for all planes of head rotation and for both target distances. We also found a dynamic misalignment of the vertical positions of the eyes during the torsional VOR, which was greatest during near viewing with symmetric convergence. This dynamic vertical skew during the torsional VOR arises, in part, because when the eyes are converged, the optical axes are not parallel to the naso-occipital axes around which the eyes are rotating. In five of six subjects, the <b>average</b> <b>skew</b> ranged 0. 9 °– 2. 9 ° and was reduced to < 0. 4 ° by a ‘torsional’ quick-phase (around the naso-occipital axis) occurring < 110 ms after the onset of the impulse. We propose that the torsional quick-phase mechanism during the torsional VOR could serve at least three functions: (1) resetting the retinal meridians closer to their usual orientation in the head, (2) correcting for the ‘skew’ deviation created by misalignment between the axes around which the eyes are rotating and the line of sight, and (3) taking the eyes back toward Listing’s plane...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{intended}} to facilitate fair research evaluations in economics. Field- and time-normalization of citation impact is the standard method in bibliometrics. Since citation rates for journal papers differ substantially across publication years and Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) classification codes, citation rates should be normalized for the comparison of papers across different time periods and economic subfields. Without normalization, both factors that are independent of research quality bias the results of citation analyses. We introduce two normalized indicators in economics, which {{are the most important}} indicators in bibliometrics: (1) the mean normalized citation score (MNCS) compares the citation impact of a focal paper with the mean impact of similar papers published in the same economic subfield and publication year. (2) PPtop 50 % is the share of papers that belong to the above-average half in a certain subfield and time period.

40|$|Determining the {{evolutionary}} basis {{of variation in}} reproductive skew (degree of sharing of reproduction among coexisting individuals) is an important task both because skew varies widely across social taxa and because testing models of skew evolution permits tests of kin selection theory. Using parentage analyses based on microsatellite markers, we measured skew among female eggs (n= 32. 3 eggs per colony, range= 20 – 68) in 17 polygynous colonies from a UK field population of the ant Leptothorax acervorum. We used skew among eggs as our principal measure of skew {{because of the high}} degree of queen turnover in the study population. Queens within colonies did not make significantly unequal contributions to queen and worker adult or pupal offspring, indicating that skew among female eggs reflected skew among daughter queens. On <b>average,</b> both <b>skew</b> among female eggs (measured by the B index) and queen–queen relatedness proved to be low (means±SE= 0. 06 ± 0. 02 and 0. 28 ± 0. 08, respectively). However, contrary to current skew models, there was no significant association of skew with either relatedness or worker number (used as a measure of productivity). In L. acervorum, predictions of the concession model of skew may hold between but not within populations because queens are unable to assess their relatedness to other queens within colonies. Additional phenomena that may help maintain low skew in the study population include indiscriminate infanticide in the form of egg cannibalism and split sex ratios that penalize reproductive monopoly by single queens within polygynous colonies...|$|R

We present {{a study of the}} internal colour variation within galaxies from the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR 7). We statistically study the connection between the internal colour variation and global galactic properties, looking for hints of the recent galactic evolution. Considering only galaxies with good photometry and spectral measurements, we define four luminosity-threshold samples within the redshift range 0. 01 <z< 0. 17, each containing more than 48000 galaxies. Colour gradients are calculated for these galaxies from the surface brightness measurements provided by the SDSS DR 7. Possible systematic effects in their determination have been analysed. We find that, on average, galaxies have redder cores than their external parts. We also find that it is more likely to find steep colour gradients among late-type galaxies. This result holds for a range of classifications based on both morphological and spectral characteristics. In fact, our results relate, on average, steep colour gradients to a higher presence of young stars within a galaxy. Our results also suggest that nuclear activity is a marginal driver for creating steep colour gradients in massive galaxies. We have selected pairs of interacting galaxies, with a separation of 5 arcsec, in projected radius, and a difference in redshift of 100 km/s, finding that they present steeper gradients than the <b>average</b> population, <b>skewed</b> towards bluer cores.

Also noted was that drivers with Type II diabetes (adult onset), which is more common among the elderly, are subject to reduced sensation in their lower extremities (peripheral neuropathy) with related impairment in positional knowledge of foot placement (proprioception). Wired wrote that since investigators have been [...] "unable to find evidence supporting drivers’ claims their Toyotas suddenly raced out of control" [...] operator error is the most likely explanation. However, victims and relatives of sudden acceleration cases are commonly unwilling to suspect involved loved ones, and blame the vehicle instead. [...] Analysis of alleged Toyota acceleration reports in The Atlantic and other sources have found the highest distribution of involved drivers between 70 and 80 years old, with the <b>average</b> age <b>skewing</b> over 55; with elderly susceptibility to [...] "neuronal misfiring" [...] and pedal misapplication as a possible cause. While many alleged cases lack exact details, over half of reported incidents occurred from a complete stop or low speed, providing a window for the pedal misapplication to occur. A prior GM study found that 60- and 70-year-olds were six times more likely to experience sudden acceleration than 20- to 30-year-olds. In the New York Times, Richard Schmidt concluded that a brake override system could prevent acceleration cases where a vehicle defect existed, but would not prevent sudden acceleration cases caused by pedal misapplication.|$|R

As a result, {{these measures are}} increasingly used as part of academic staff assessment. The present study tests the hypotheses that IFs exhibit patterns that are consistent between journals of different specialties and that these IFs reflect the quality of staff academic performance. Methods: The IFs of a sample of journals from each of four medical specialties - medicine, oncology, genetics, and public and occupational health-were downloaded from the Science Citation Index and compared. Overall and specialty-specific journal IF frequencies were analyzed with respect to distribution patterns, <b>averages,</b> and <b>skew.</b> Results: Approximately 91 % of journal IFs fell within the 0 to 5 range, with 97 % being less than 10. The overall IF distribution featured a positive skew and a mean of 2. 5. Separate analysis of the journal specialty subsets revealed significant differences in IF means (genetics 3. 4 > oncology 3. 1 > medicine 2. 0 > public health 1. 6; p <. 006), all of which well exceeded the respective IF medians. Journals from the general medicine category exhibited both the lowest IF median (0. 7) and the most positively skewed distribution. Conclusion: The distribution of IFs exhibits degrees of <b>skew,</b> numeric <b>average,</b> and spread that differ significantly between journal specialty subsets. This suggests that factors other than random variations underlie much of the IF variation between specialty journals and reduces the plausibility of a reliable correlation between IFs {{and the quality of}} academic staff performance.

Our technique consists of sorting the segmented characters according to the X axis, then detecting the segments belonging to the container number, after that, we divide the segments by groups having the same height, and finally the rotation angle of the image will be the <b>average</b> of the <b>skewed</b> angles related to each group. Our approach is robust, efficient and capable of handling any font and size of characters; regarding its complexity for an image having N lines and M characters, the worst CPU time usage and the worst memory usage is equal to O (NxM) while the network usage and disk usage for one image is O (1) which led –while using an old laptop- to a response time around 0. 45 milliseconds to detect the rotation angle of an image when rotated from- 45 o to + 45 o with an precision error between ± 0. 2 o. The high accuracy and the fast response time for detecting the rotation angle of container images make our approach suitable for online OCR critical applications...|$|R
40|$|In 1990 UNDP {{published}} {{its first}} Human Development Report, with its newly devised Human Development Index. The {{premise of the}} HDI, considered radical at the time, was elegantly simple: national development should be measured not simply by national income, as had long been the practice, but also by life expectancy and literacy. The new HDI had its shortcomings, as the Report’s authors forthrightly acknowledged, including a reliance on national <b>averages,</b> which concealed <b>skewed</b> distribution, {{and the absence of}} “a quantitative measure of human freedom. ” Yet it successfully advanced the Report’s central thesis, stated succinctly in its first sentence: “People are the real wealth of a nation. ” Twenty years later the conceptual brilliance and continuing relevance of that original human development paradigm are indisputable. It is now almost universally accepted that a coun-try’s success or an individual’s well-being cannot be evaluated by money alone. Income is of course crucial: without resources, any progress is difficult. Yet we must also gauge whether people can lead long and healthy lives, whether they have the opportunity to be educated and whether they are free to use their knowledge and talents to shape their own destinies...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 1 (published in Naturwissenshaften) is a {{side project}} on {{honeybee}} behavior. We showed that honeybee colonies that are headed by queens who are artificially inseminated with the sperm {{of a single}} drone have egg-eating policing behavior, just like colonies with naturally mated, highly polyandrous queens. Chapter 2 is an ESS-style model of worker reproduction in honeybee colonies, suggesting that workers may invest in selfish reproduction if they sense the queen {{may be about to}} die. Chapter 3 (published in BMC Evolutionary Biology) addresses the evolution of multiple mating in the Vespine wasps. First, I used microsatellite markers to describe how many patrilines are present in colonies of five wasp species, four of which are in the enigmatic Vespula rufa species group, and the last a facultative social parasite of another species of yellowjacket. I also performed a comparative analysis of paternity number and paternity skew across 21 species of yellowjacket wasps and hornets (Vespidae: Vespinae). Species with larger colonies have higher average paternity frequencies and lower <b>average</b> paternity <b>skew,</b> with interesting implications for the evolution of polyandry in this group. Chapters 4 and 5 focus on the adaptive significance of matricide in Dolichovespula arenaria, an aerially nesting yellowjacket wasp. I describe matricide {{for the first time in}} this species, and use experiments and genetic analyses to show that in natural and lab colonies, queens that are killed are typically those who have mated few times, or who use sperm in a strongly biased way, resulting in high worker relatedness. Queens who have mated multiply and use sperm evenly are rarely killed, supporting the hypothesis that workers kill queens as a result of conflict over the production of males. Experiments suggested that queens laying only male eggs do not trigger matricide, nor does an abrupt drop in queen fecundity, contrary to theoretical predictions. Chapter 6 examines the evolution of cuticular hydrocarbon diversity across the polistine wasps, and provides evidence that the diversity of recognition compounds correlates with social organization, suggesting that these compounds have evolved in response to their function in recognition behavior. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|R
