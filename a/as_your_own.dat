500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You have your own ideas. We do not want that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I suppose you were made so!... Had you chosen a name which we could approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so. I am sorry but you make your own difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as well <b>as</b> <b>your</b> <b>own.</b> Perhaps in time you will learn the lessons that we all have to learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become a worry for Pankhurst as well. She decided that Adela should move to Australia, and paid for her relocation. They never saw one another again.|$|E
2500|$|You {{wake up in}} {{the morning}} and find {{yourself}} back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well <b>as</b> <b>your</b> <b>own.</b> [...] in nine months he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you.|$|E

2500|$|The second rank {{describes}} {{the recognition of}} the Absolute within [...] "the midst of the variety of different situations in action; you see everything before your eyes <b>as</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> original true clean face, just as if you were looking at your face in the mirror". That is, unlike the insight of the first rank, which can be easily disturbed, the second rank has greater constancy in the face of distractions. However, seeing the absolute within the relative does not extend to one's behavior towards others. Hakuin describes that at this point one [...] "is neither conversant with the deportment of the bodhisattva, nor does he understand the causal conditions for a Buddha-land. Although he has a clear understanding of the Universal and True Wisdom, he cannot cause to shine forth the Marvelous Wisdom that comprehends the unobstructed interpenetration of the manifold dharmas." ...|$|E

Several paragraph-long quotations that the two books share have ellipses in the same position. Finkelstein claimed that in one instance Dershowitz refers to the same page number as Peters, although he is citing a different (1996) edition of the same source, in which the words appear on a different page. Finkelstein stated: [...] "It is left to readers to decide whether Dershowitz committed plagiarism as defined by Harvard Universityâ€”'passing off a source's information, ideas, or words <b>as</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> by omitting to cite them.' [...] According to a book review of Beyond Chutzpah, written by Prof. Michael C. Desch in The American Conservative, [...] "Finkelstein does not accuse Dershowitz of the wholesale lifting of someone else's words, but he does make a very strong case that Dershowitz has violated the spirit, if not the exact letter, of Harvard's prohibitions of the first three forms of plagiarism." ...|$|E
2500|$|In her {{well-known}} article [...] "A Defense of Abortion", Judith Jarvis Thomson {{argues that}} abortion is in some circumstances permissible even if the embryo is a person and {{has a right to}} life, because the embryo's right to life is overtrumped by the woman's right to control her body and its life-support functions. [...] Her central argument involves a thought experiment. [...] Imagine, Thomson says, that you wake up in bed next to a famous violinist. [...] He is unconscious with a fatal kidney ailment; and because only you happen to have the right blood type to help, the Society of Music Lovers has kidnapped you and plugged your circulatory system into his so that your kidneys can filter poisons from his blood as well <b>as</b> <b>your</b> <b>own.</b> [...] If he is disconnected from you now, he will die; but in nine months he will recover and can be safely disconnected. [...] Thomson takes it that you may permissibly unplug yourself from the violinist even though this will kill him. [...] The right to life, Thomson says, does not entail the right to use another person's body, and so in disconnecting the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of somethingthe use of your bodyto which he has no right. [...] Similarly, even if the fetus has a right to life, it does not have a right to use the pregnant woman's body and life-support functions against her will; and so aborting the pregnancy is permissible in at least some circumstances. [...] However, Thomson notes that the woman's right to abortion does not include the right to directly insist upon the death of the child, should the fetus happen to be viable, that is, capable of surviving outside the womb.|$|E
