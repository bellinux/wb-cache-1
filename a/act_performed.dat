In March 1492, the monarchs issued the Edict of Expulsion of the Jews, also called the Alhambra Decree, a document which ordered all Jews either to be baptised and convert to Christianity or to leave the country.. It allowed Mudéjar Moors (Islamic) and converso Marrano Jews to stay, while expelling all unconverted Jews from Castile and Aragon (most Jews either converted or moved to Islamic lands of North Africa and the Ottoman Empire). 1492 was also the year in which the monarchs commissioned Christopher Columbus to find a westward maritime route for access to Asia, which resulted in the Spanish arrival in the Americas.|$|E

25|$|Most {{chapters}} {{begin with}} brief re-tellings of creation myths that emerged as attempts {{to explain the}} origin of particular observed phenomena. Dawkins selects these myths from throughout the world, including Babylonian, Judeo-Christian, Aztec, Maori, Ancient Egyptian, Australian Aboriginal, Nordic, Hellenic, Chinese, Japanese, and other traditions. Chapter 9 ("Are we alone?") includes contemporary alien-abduction mythology; Chapter 4 ("What are things made of?") omits mythology altogether as Dawkins says that really small phenomena were unknown to primitive peoples prior to the invention of advanced optical magnification equipment, any texts they believed to be divinely inspired having failed to mention such useful knowledge as beyond human experience at the time. Dawkins also revisits his childhood and recalls his initial thoughts on these various phenomena or those thoughts expressed by his young contemporaries. Dawkins gives his critique {{of many of the}} myths, such as when he points out that much mythology involves some god's symbolic transgressive <b>act</b> <b>performed</b> just once, with Dawkins saying that such one-time acts would be inadequate to explain the mechanism as to why the phenomena continue to happen in unbroken cycles.|$|E

On the fifth day, Scherzinger suggested that the Over-25s category be changed to Over 28s, as the quality of older singers was high. The Boys and Girls categories then comprised singers aged 16 to 28, rather than 16 to 25. As the groups category was the weakest, five rejected soloists from the Boys category and four from the Girls category were asked to form two groups, One Direction and Belle Amie [...] respectively. After bootcamp, each judge was assigned a category: Cowell was given the Groups, Walsh had the Over-28s, Minogue was asked to look after the Boys and Cole was assigned the Girls.|$|E
500|$|On The Onyx Hotel Tour, after {{performing}} [...] "Showdown", a video interlude followed featuring Spears and {{her friends}} outside a club. While she was leaving, she noticed a woman dressed in 1930s fashion. She followed her and the woman asked Spears to enter the [...] "Mystic Lounge". Spears reappeared wearing a corset to perform [...] "…Baby One More Time" [...] along with [...] "Oops!...I Did It Again" [...] and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy". All of the three were reworked for the show with elements of jazz and blues. [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] was also performed on the promotional tour made on some House of Blues locations, called The M+M's Tour. The show started with Spears singing a short version of the song {{dressed in a white}} go-go boots, a white miniskirt and a sparkling pink bikini top. On The Circus Starring Britney Spears, the song made into the Electro Circ act. It was the final song of the <b>act,</b> <b>performed</b> after [...] "Toxic". The performance consisted on Spears and her dancers performing a remix of the song. On 2011's Femme Fatale Tour, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] was performed in a medley with the remix of Rihanna's [...] "S" [...] (2010).

500|$|His Lancashire {{teammate}} Andrew Flintoff {{thought him}} to be aloof and compared his attitude to that of Prince Charles. In Australia's three Test and five match ODI tour of India in early 2001, Ganguly caused controversy by arriving late for the toss on four occasions, something that agitated opposing captain Steve Waugh. In the Fourth ODI, he caused further controversy by failing to wear his playing attire to the toss, something considered unusual in cricket circles. However, India won the Test series 2–1, ending Australia's run of 16 consecutive Test match victories in the Second Test. The match saw India looking set for defeat after conceding a first innings lead of 274. Waugh chose to enforce the follow-on and V. V. S. Laxman (281) and Rahul Dravid (180) batted for the entire fourth day's play to set Australia a target of 384 on a dusty, spinning wicket. The Australians were unable to survive and became only the third team to lose a Test after enforcing the follow-on. In November 2001, Ganguly's wife Dona gave birth to their daughter Sana Ganguly. During the final match of the 2002 NatWest Series held in Lords after a stunning performance by team mates Yuvraj Singh and Mohammad Kaif, Ganguly took off his shirt in public and brandished {{it in the air}} to celebrate India's winning of the match. He was later strongly condemned for tarnishing the [...] "gentleman's game" [...] image of cricket and disrespecting Lord's protocol. Ganguly said that he was only mimicking an <b>act</b> <b>performed</b> by the British all-rounder Andrew Flintoff during a tour of India. In 2003, India reached the World Cup Final {{for the first time since}} 1983, where they lost to the Australians. Ganguly had a successful tournament personally, scoring 465runs at an average of 58.12, including three centuries.|$|E

500|$|The main show {{started with}} Cyrus {{descending}} {{onto the stage}} in a neon pink cube that bore a digital image of her silhouette, as pink fireworks were fired behind her. Donning a long, sequined, cheetah and black-striped tank top and cardigan, sparkling black tights, black boots, and the blonde Hannah Montana wig, she began to perform the concert's opening number, [...] "Rock Star". In continuation, Cyrus was joined by multiple backup dancers to perform dance routines for [...] "Life's What You Make It". Removing the cardigan, she concluded the segment with [...] "Just Like You". Still costumed as Hannah Montana, Cyrus reappeared {{from the back of}} the stage, wearing sparkly blue denim jeans, a white tank top, a blue denim vest, and shiny silver tie; she performed [...] "Old Blue Jeans" [...] among female backup dancers and [...] "Nobody's Perfect" [...] roaming the stage alone. The next segment began with the performance of [...] "Pumpin' Up the Party", where Cyrus dressed with a pink and purple sequined mini-dress, fuchsia ad violet tights and maroon boots and dancers wore 1960s-inspired attires while performing calisthenics. The segment continued with [...] "I Got Nerve", which required participation and elaborate routines on behalf of the dancers, and a duet with the opening act. While they served as opening act, [...] "We Got the Party" [...] was performed as a duet with the Jonas Brothers. She annexed a pink and purple trench coat to her attire and performed with the Jonas Brothers, who also played electric guitars. At one point of the performance, Cyrus disappeared to be replaced by a body double who completed the performance. While Aly & A.J. and Everlife served as opening acts, a postmodern cover of Kiss' [...] "Rock and Roll All Nite" [...] (1975) was performed by them and Cyrus wore a geometric-patterned cocktail dress. Afterwards, the opening <b>act</b> <b>performed</b> an interlude of several songs.|$|E

Jo Zette, a Maltese drag <b>act,</b> <b>performed</b> the fourth song of the evening, [...] "I'm Me". It was composed by Steve Compagno and Noel Zammit and is an anthemic Pop song about being true to yourself.

2500|$|The live shows {{began on}} 10 October 2009, and {{continued}} {{through to the}} finale on 12 December 2009. For this series the results shows were on Sunday nights instead of Saturdays as they were {{for the first five}} series. In another change to the format of previous years, the remaining finalists performed a song as a group at the start of each results show. As previously, each week had a different song theme. Each <b>act</b> <b>performed</b> one song on the Saturday night show and the results were announced on the Sunday. Beginning with week 8 of the live shows, with five acts remaining, each contestant would sing two songs. Up to week 8, the two acts with the fewest public votes were in the bottom two and would sing again in the [...] "final showdown". The songs they performed in the bottom two were of their own choice and did not necessarily follow that week's theme. The four judges then each chose one act from the bottom two that they wanted to be eliminated from the show. If each act received an equal number of judges' votes, the result was deadlocked and the act with the fewest public votes was eliminated. From week 8 onwards, there was no bottom two and the act with the fewest votes was eliminated. In a change to the format of previous years, the remaining finalists performed a song as a group at the start of each results show.|$|E
