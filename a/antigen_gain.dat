40|$|Abstract. Endoglin (CD 105) is an {{accessory}} receptor for transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and its expression is up-regulated in actively proliferating endothelial cells. Endoglin {{has been suggested}} as an appropriate marker for tumor-related angiogenesis and neovascularization. Several studies demonstrate the potential of endoglin in tumor diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. This review details the structure and function of endoglin, and investigates the role of endoglin in angiogenesis and tumor diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Recent movements towards antibody-based therapeutic strategies in cancers {{have resulted in the}} characterization of several potential antigens. Endoglin, also known as CD 105, is one such <b>antigen</b> <b>gaining</b> widespread popularity. Endoglin was originally characterized over two decade...|$|R
40|$|In {{order for}} {{cytotoxic}} T cells to initiate immune responses, peptides derived from internalized antigens must {{be presented to}} the cytotoxic T cells on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Here we show that dendritic cells, the only antigen-presenting cells that initiate immune responses efficiently, have developed a unique membrane transport pathway linking the lumen of endocytic compartments and the cytosol, Endosome-to-cytosol transport is restricted to dendritic cells, specific to internalized antigens and selective for the size of the transported molecules. Thus, in dendritic cells, internalized <b>antigens</b> <b>gain</b> access to the cytosolic antigen-processing machinery and to the conventional MHC class I antigen-presentation pathway...|$|R
40|$|AbstractReactivity to {{intestinal}} epithelium-specific antigen was {{studied by}} transgenic expression of cytosolic ovalbumin controlled by an enterocyte-specific promoter. Transferred OVA-specific CD 8 cells (OT-I) preferentially expanded in mucosal lymphoid tissues and the epithelium {{but failed to}} cause tissue damage. In contrast, concomitant VSV-ova infection induced OT-I-mediated epithelial cell destruction that correlated with antigen density. OT-I cells retained in the epithelium exhibited high levels of lytic activity but were unable to produce cytokines. The mice were systemically tolerant to OVA since endogenous CD 8 cells were nonresponsive to VSV-ova infection. Thus, intestinal <b>antigen</b> <b>gained</b> access to peripheral tissues via absorption from effete epithelial cells. This system demonstrated a requirement for inflammation to drive pathogenic autoreactivity against enterocytes and identified pathways of intestine-specific immunoregulation...|$|R
40|$|Influenza virosomes are virus-like particles, which {{retain the}} cell binding and {{membrane}} fusion {{properties of the}} native virus, but lack the viral genetic material. These functional characteristics of influenza virosomes {{form the basis for}} their immunogenicity First, the repetitive arrangement of the major viral envelope glycoprotein, haemagglutinin, on the virosomal surface mediates a co-operative interaction with Ig receptors on B lymphocytes, stimulating strong antibody responses. In addition, virosomes interact efficiently with antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, resulting in activation of T lymphocytes and induction of a balanced Th 1 /Th 2 response. Also, as a result of fusion of the virosomes with the endosomal membrane, virosome-encapsulated <b>antigens</b> <b>gain</b> access to the MHC class I presentation pathway, thus priming cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity.

5000|$|Upon {{receiving}} an unidentified stimulus, the maturing B cells (centroblasts) migrate {{from the dark}} zone to the light zone and start to express their antibody on the cell surface and at this stage {{are referred to as}} centrocytes. The centrocytes {{are in a state of}} activated apoptosis and compete for survival signals derived from follicular dendritic cell and TFH cells. This rescue process, known as germinal center selection, is believed to be dependent on the affinity of their surface antibody to the antigen. Such that, a B cell that has successfully gained mutations that confer a higher affinity surface antibody towards <b>antigen</b> <b>gains</b> a survival advantage over lower affinity B cell clones and those that have gained deleterious mutations. Cyclic re-entry into the dark zone once again as centroblasts allows a chance for otherwise non-selected B cell mutants to gain more mutations in order to improve affinity towards antigen. Interactions with T cells are also believed to prevent the generation of autoreactive germinal center B cells.|$|R
40|$|Previously, a peptide epitope {{derived from}} the Hsp 60 {{molecule}} of Salmonella that is presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ib molecule Qa- 1 to CD 8 + cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) was described. In the present study we investigated the Salmonella-induced processing and presentation pathway for generating this Qa- 1 -restricted epitope. Live bacteria and, to a lesser extent, opsonized heat-killed bacteria are able to sensitize target cells for lysis by Salmonella-specific CTL. In contrast, heat-killed bacteria cannot sensitize target cells. Presentation of the Hsp 60 epitope appears independent of bacterial internalization, because cytochalasin D does not affect presentation. Moreover, Salmonella strains defective in the InvA or InvE operon, two critical components of the type III secretion pathway, are as efficient as wild-type Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in sensitizing infected targets to lysis. Collectively, these results suggest {{the existence of a}} novel antigen-processing pathway in which exogenous <b>antigens</b> <b>gain</b> access to the cytosolic MHC class I processing machinery. Considering the abundant nature of bacterial Hsp 60 and the upregulation of this protein after Salmonella infection of eukaryotic cells, this mode of antigen presentation may be particularly relevant to understanding the host defense mechanisms against gram-negative bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) class I and II molecules can both present cytosolic and nuclear antigens to CD 8 (+) and CD 4 (+) T cells, respectively. However, MHC class I displays proteasomal, whereas MHC class II molecules display lysosomal, degradation products. One pathway by which intracellular <b>antigens</b> <b>gain</b> access to lysosomal degradation is macroautophagy. Therefore, MHC class II presentation of antigens that are targeted to autophagosomes {{can be used}} to investigate regulation events of the macroautophagy pathway. We fuse antigens to Atg 8 /LC 3 for targeting to autophagosomes, because this ubiquitin-like protein is selectively coupled to autophagosome membranes, and the portion that is coupled to the inner autophagosome membrane is degraded with this membrane in lysosomes. The localization of these fusion antigens in MHC class II loading compartments can be visualized by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, and used as a measure of autophagic amphisome generation. In addition, MHC class II presentation of autophagosome-targeted antigens can be monitored by CD 4 (+) T cell recognition and indicates completion of macroautophagy. Together these immunological assays are well suited to investigate autophagic flux and analyze experimental conditions and physiological perturbations for their influence on macroautophagy...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{identified}} cortical sinuses as sites of sphingosine- 1 -phosphate receptor- 1 (S 1 P 1) -dependent T- and B-cell egress from the lymph node (LN) parenchyma. However, {{the distribution of}} cortical sinuses in the entire LN {{and the extent of}} lymph flow within them has been unclear. Using 3 D reconstruction and intravital two-photon microscopy we describe the branched organization of the cortical sinus network within the inguinal LN and show that lymphocyte flow begins within blunt-ended sinuses. Many cortical sinuses are situated adjacent to high endothelial venules, and some lymphocytes access these sinuses within minutes of entering a LN. However, upon entry to inflamed LNs, lymphocytes rapidly up-regulate CD 69 and are prevented from accessing cortical sinuses. Using the LN reconstruction data and knowledge of lymphocyte migration and cortical sinus entry dynamics, we developed a mathematical model of T-cell egress from LNs. The model suggests that random walk encounters with lymphatic sinuses are the major factor contributing to LN transit times. A slight discrepancy between predictions of the model and the measured transit times may be explained by lymphocytes undergoing a few rounds of migration between the parenchyma and sinuses before departing from the LN. Because large soluble <b>antigens</b> <b>gain</b> rapid access to cortical sinuses, such parenchyma–sinus shuttling may facilitate antibody responses...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} antigen {{recognition}} depends {{in part on}} the amount of peptide antigen available and the affinity of the T cell receptor for a particular peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule complex. The availability of self antigen is limited by antigen processing, which is compartmentalized such that peptide antigens presented by MHC class I molecules originate in the cytoplasm, whereas peptide antigens presented by MHC class II molecules are acquired from the endocytic pathway. This segregation of the antigen-processing pathways may limit the diversity of antigens that influence the development and selection of, e. g., CD 4 -positive, MHC class II-specific T cells. Selection in this case might involve only a subset of self- encoded proteins, specifically those that are plasma membrane bound or secreted. To study these aspects of immune development, we engineered pigeon cytochrome for expression in transgenic mice in two forms: one in which it was expressed as a type II plasma membrane protein, and a second in which it was targeted to the mitochondria after cytoplasmic synthesis. Experiments with these mice clearly show that tolerance is induced in the thymus, irrespective of antigen compartmentation. Using radiation bone marrow chimeras, we further show that cytoplasmic/mitochondrial <b>antigen</b> <b>gains</b> access to the MHC class II pathway by direct presentation. As a result of studying the anatomy of the thymus, we show that the amount of antigen and the affinity of the TCR affect the location and time point of thymocytes under-going apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{need for}} more efficacious inactivated {{influenza}} vaccines, since current formulations show suboptimal immunogenicity in at-risk populations, like the elderly. More effective vaccines are also urgently needed for an improved influenza pandemic preparedness. In this context, there is considerable interest in virosomes. Virosomes are virus-like particles, consisting of reconstituted influenza virus envelopes, lacking the genetic material of the native virus. Virosomes are produced from influenza virus through a detergent solubilization and removal procedure. Properly reconstituted virosomes retain the cell binding and membrane fusion properties of the native virus, mediated by the viral envelope glycoprotein haemagglutinin. These functional characteristics of virosomes form the basis for their enhanced immunogenicity. First, the repetitive arrangement of haemagglutinin molecules on the virosomal surface mediates a cooperative interaction of the antigen with Ig receptors on B lymphocytes, stimulating strong antibody responses. In addition, virosomes interact efficiently with antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, resulting in activation of T lymphocytes. In a murine model system, virosomes, as compared to conventional subunit vaccine, which consists of isolated influenza envelope glycoproteins, induce a more balanced T helper I versus T helper 2 response, virosomes in particular eliciting stronger T helper I responses than subunit vaccine. Also, as a result of fusion of the virosomes with the endosomal membrane, part of the virosomal <b>antigen</b> <b>gains</b> access to the major histocompatibility class I presentation pathway, thus priming cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity. Finally, virosomes represent an excellent platform for inclusion of lipophilic adjuvants for further stimulation of vaccine immunogenicity. By virtue of these characteristics, virosomes represent a promising novel class of inactivated influenza vaccines, which not only induce high virus-neutralizing antibody titres, but also prime the cellular arm of the immune system.

These structural changes of arteriolar capillaries explain the presence of circulating plasma as a constant and major component of the early amyloid lesions in these animals and on this basis may determine the time of onset and site of formation of the lesions.

Using five-feature mice that harbour YAC-based germline-configuration human IgM, Igκ and Igλ transloci in a mouse background disrupted for endogenous mouse IgH and Igκ expression, gp 140 -specific human IgM mAbs were readily elicited following serial immunisation. These mAbs were converted to human IgG 1 format and were found to bind diverse epitopes within gp 140, exhibiting high functional affinity for the antigen-typically in the nanomolar or sub-nanomolar range. The number of specific, stable hybridomas per mouse was, however, low (typically around five) with the hybridomas within individual mice often being clonally related. Nevertheless, different mice used B cell clones expressing varied V(D) J combinations, with affinity maturation through somatic hypermutation making a critical contribution.

40|$|There {{is a new}} “minor <b>antigen</b> ” <b>gaining</b> {{attention}} {{in the field of}} human leukocyte antigen (HLA) testing and kidney transplantation: the major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC) class I-related chain A, or MICA antigen. It is classified as a “minor antigen ” because it is not an HLA antigen (ie, HLA-A, HLA-B, etc.). The major reason MICA has become a molecule of interest is related to the natural history of renal allograft survival. While the one-year graft survival rates for living and/or deceased donor kidney transplants are approximately 90 %, graft survival rates drop to about 80 % at five years and to 50 % or less at 10 years. Advances in both immunosuppression and HLA matching, particularly of HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR antigens, have contributed to improved graft survival and patient survival, especially within the first year.

We investigated the impact of premature termination of transgene expression at various time points (day 3 to day 60) following immunization. When transgene expression was terminated before the maximum response had been attained, overall expansion was attenuated, yielding a small memory population. When transgene expression was terminated between day 13 and day 30, the memory population was not sustained, demonstrating that the early memory population was antigen dependent. Extinction of transgene expression at day 60 had no obvious impact on memory maintenance, indicating that maintenance of the memory population may ultimately become independent of transgene expression. Premature termination of antigen expression had significant but modest effects on the phenotype and cytokine profile of the memory population.

40|$|Protective {{immunity}} to infection by many intracellular pathogens requires recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) of antigens presented on {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) class I molecules. To be presented for recognition by pathogen-specific CTLs, these <b>antigens</b> must <b>gain</b> access to the host cell class I processing pathway. In the case of intracellular bacterial pathogens, the majority of bacterial proteins are retained within the bacterial membrane and therefore remain inaccessible to the host cell for antigen processing. We have isolated a CTL clone from a C 57 BL/ 6 mouse infected with the intracellular gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes (LM) and have identified {{the source of the}} antigen.

METHODS: Thirty-two maternal plasma samples taken at the second and third trimesters of gestation (median: 21. 5 weeks) were examined with MALDI-TOF MS-based SABER. The results were confirmed by serological tests on cord blood or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) typing on amniocyte-derived fetal DNA.

There was no correlation between CD 8 + T cell oligoclonality and disease. Sequencing of predominant spectratype expansions revealed shared TCRB-CDR 3 motifs when comparing inter- and/or intrapair twin members. In many cases, these sequences were homologous to published TCRs, specific for viruses implicated in MS pathogenesis, CNS autoantigens, or copaxone [glatiramer acetate (GA) ], implying the occurrence of naturally GA-responding CD 8 + T cells. It is notable that these expanded T cell clones with putative pathogenic or regulatory properties were present in the affected as well as in the healthy subject, thus suggesting the existence of a "MS predisposing trait" shared by co-twins discordant for MS...|$|R
40|$|The {{adenovirus}} E 1 A 243 R oncoprotein stimulates expression {{from the}} promoter {{of the human}} proliferating cell nuclear <b>antigen</b> (PCNA). To <b>gain</b> insight into the mechanism of activation, we analyzed deletion and point mutations of the 243 R protein for their abilities to activate PCNA promoter-directed reporter gene expression upon cotransfection into HeLa cells. Large deletions that in combination span the entire protein severely impaired the ability of E 1 A 243 R to induce PCNA expression. Smaller deletions and specific point mutations that target specific E 1 A-binding proteins were less deleterious to PCNA induction. The data suggest that E 1 A activates transcription of the PCNA gene by multiple mechanisms and that, of the known 243 R-associated proteins, p 300 and p 107 -cyclin A can mediate the response while p 105 -RB {{does not appear to}} participate. Presumably, the functional redundancy ensures that 243 R can activate expression of this essential DNA replication protein regardless of cell type and physiological conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} {{of prostate cancer}} lesions by PET imaging of the prostate-specific membrane <b>antigen</b> (PSMA) has <b>gained</b> highest clinical impact during the last years. 68 Ga-labelled Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx) -HBED-CC ([68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC) represents a successful novel PSMA inhibitor radiotracer which has recently demonstrated its suitability in individual first-in-man studies. The radiometal chelator HBED-CC used in this molecule represents a rather rarely used acyclic complexing agent with chemical characteristics favourably influencing the biological functionality of the PSMA inhibitor. The simple replacement of HBED-CC by the prominent radiometal chelator DOTA was shown to dramatically reduce the in vivo imaging quality of the respective 68 Ga-labelled PSMA-targeted tracer proving that HBED-CC contributes intrinsically to the PSMA binding of the Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx) pharmacophore. Owing to the obvious growing clinical impact, this work aims to reflect the properties of HBED-CC as acyclic radiometal chelator and presents novel preclinical data and relevant aspects of the radiopharmaceutical production process of [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of cancer-associated gene {{products}} evoke immune recognition, but host reactions rarely impede disease progression. The weak immunogenicity of nascent tumors contributes to this failure in host defense. Therapeutic vaccines that enhance dendritic cell presentation of cancer antigens increase specific cellular and humoral responses, thereby effectuating tumor destruction in some cases. The attenuation of T cell activation by cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA- 4) further limits the potency of tumor immunity. In murine systems, the administration of antibodies that block CTLA- 4 function inhibits the growth of moderately immunogenic tumors and, in combination with cancer vaccines, increases the rejection of poorly immunogenic tumors, albeit {{with a loss of}} tolerance to normal differentiation <b>antigens.</b> To <b>gain</b> a preliminary assessment of the biologic activity of antagonizing CTLA- 4 function in humans, we infused a CTLA- 4 blocking antibody (MDX-CTLA 4) into nine previously immunized advanced cancer patients. MDX-CTLA 4 stimulated extensive tumor necrosis with lymphocyte and granulocyte infiltrates in three of three metastatic melanoma patients and the reduction or stabilization of CA- 125 levels in two of two metastatic ovarian carcinoma patients previously vaccinated with irradiated, autologous granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor-secreting tumor cells. MDX-CTLA 4 did not elicit tumor necrosis in four of four metastatic melanoma patients previously immunized with defined melanosomal antigens. No serious toxicities directly attributable to the antibody were observed, although five of seven melanoma patients developed T cell reactivity to normal melanocytes. These findings suggest that CTLA- 4 antibody blockade increases tumor immunity in some previously vaccinated cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|CD 1 e is {{the only}} human CD 1 protein {{existing}} in soluble form in the late endosomes of dendritic cells, where it facilitates the processing of glycolipid antigens that are ultimately recognized by CD 1 b-restricted T cells. The precise function of CD 1 e remains undefined, thus impeding efforts to predict the participation of this protein in the presentation of other <b>antigens.</b> To <b>gain</b> insight into its function, we determined the crystal structure of recombinant CD 1 e expressed in human cells at 2. 90 -A resolution. The structure revealed a groove less intricate than in other CD 1 proteins, with a significantly wider portal characterized by a 2 A-larger spacing between the alpha 1 and alpha 2 helices. No electron density corresponding to endogenous ligands was detected within the groove, {{despite the presence of}} ligands unequivocally established by native mass spectrometry in recombinant CD 1 e. Our structural data indicate that the water-exposed CD 1 e groove could ensure the establishment of loose contacts with lipids. In agreement with this possibility, lipid association and dissociation processes were found to be considerably faster with CD 1 e than with CD 1 b. Moreover, CD 1 e was found to mediate in vitro the transfer of lipids to CD 1 b and the displacement of lipids from stable CD 1 b-antigen complexes. Altogether, these data support that CD 1 e could have evolved to mediate lipid-exchange/editing processes with CD 1 b and point to a pathway whereby the repertoire of lipid antigens presented by human dendritic cells might be expanded...|$|R
