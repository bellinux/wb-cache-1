5|$|Sirenia is {{an order}} of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit rivers, estuaries, coastal marine waters, swamps and marine wetlands. Sirenians, {{including}} manatees and dugongs, possess major aquatic adaptations: arms used for steering, <b>a</b> <b>paddle</b> used for propulsion, and remnants of hind limbs (legs) {{in the form of}} two small bones floating deep in the muscle. They look ponderous and clumsy but are actually fusiform, hydrodynamic and highly muscular, and mariners before the mid-nineteenth century referred to them as mermaids.|$|E

Mark Sanders was beaten with <b>a</b> <b>paddle</b> and a broom by other fraternity members, while Hamm was leading him with a hammer claw around Sander's testicles around the fraternity house; Sanders' clothes were also set afire. The incident resulted in the fraternity being shut down on campus. Hamm made a plea deal and completed probation under the terms of a deferred adjudication; the charges were dismissed during August 1995.|$|E
5|$|By 1864 {{the company}} was {{operating}} a fleet of at least four ships - the Kiama was still in service, {{and she had been}} joined by Hunter, Mynora and Kembla. Both Kembla, a 204-ton iron steamship, and Hunter, <b>a</b> <b>paddle</b> steamer with a net weight of 105 tons, were built in Glasgow, Scotland. The Mynora was built in Australia at Prymont in Sydney. A 117-ton wooden paddle steamer, her time with the company ended in 1864 after she ran into St Georges Head in Wreck Bay. In an attempt to save the lives of passengers and crew, the captain fought to keep the ship afloat until she finally ran aground on a sandy beach approximately three miles from the headland. While the boat was lost, all of the passengers and crew on Mynora were saved.|$|E
5|$|Green Grocer (set number: 10185) was {{the third}} of the Modular Buildings series. It was {{originally}} released in 2008. The set contains 2352 pieces and is recommended for builders 16 {{years of age or}} older. Some of the set features include a blue and white awning, opening doors and windows, detailed interiors to each room, a roof terrace, a fire escape, access to a courtyard behind the building, and 4 minifigures. Advanced building techniques used in Green Grocer include using black skeleton legs and hammers to make railings, using black spear guns as railings for the fire escape, using <b>a</b> <b>paddle</b> for a pendulum in a grandfather clock, and using hinges to make a bay window.|$|E

5|$|Rebound is a two-player volleyball sports game {{in which}} the players, each {{controlling}} <b>a</b> <b>paddle</b> representing a person {{on either side of}} a volleyball net, attempt to score points. The horizontal paddles are moved by the players left and right on their side of the net, represented by a short dashed line. The ball, represented by a square dot, is dropped {{from the top of the}} screen in a parabolic arc; if it hits a player's paddle, it bounces in another arc according to where on the paddle it hit. Bounces from closer to the center are more vertical, while those towards the sides move mostly horizontally. This method of changing the angle of deflection is similar to the mechanics of Pong (1972), Atari's first arcade game.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{similarity}} between Skerryvore and Dubh Artach 20miles (32kilometres) {{to the south}} east, led to the NLB painting a distinctive red band round the middle section of the latter in 1890. The Hynish Shore Station {{had the advantage of}} proximity to the site during the construction period. However, the small harbour offered little shelter for shipping. The keepers operated from here until 1892 when operations were transferred to Erraid adjacent to the Isle of Mull. Other than the signal tower, the land and buildings on Tiree were sold to George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll who had witnessed the laying of the first stone on Skerryvore fifty-two years previously. <b>A</b> <b>paddle</b> steamer, Signal, built by Laird of Greenock in 1883 was based at Erraid for relief operations. The shore station was moved to Oban in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{made her}} {{television}} debut as a villain on the June 28, 2001 episode of SmackDown! {{as part of}} The Alliance during the Invasion angle in 2001. In her first storyline with the company, she portrayed Vince McMahon's latest affair. She also regularly teamed with fellow WCW performer Stacy Keibler. The duo made their wrestling debuts in a Bra and Panties match against Lita and Trish Stratus at the InVasion pay-per-view, which Stratus and Lita won by stripping their opponents to their underwear. The following night on Raw, Wilson defeated Stratus in <b>a</b> <b>Paddle</b> on a Pole match. Despite her relative lack of in-ring experience, Wilson, alongside Keibler and Ivory, regularly feuded with the Divas, as well as interfering in matches on behalf of other wrestlers in The Alliance.|$|E

5|$|In February 1858, Ives {{returned}} to the area in <b>a</b> <b>paddle</b> steamer named Explorer. He was leading an expedition up the Colorado from the south, and he wanted Irataba to guide them. The Mohave gave permission to navigate the river, and Cairook, Irataba, and a 16-year-old Mohave boy named Nahvahroopa joined them. Möllhausen again accompanied the expedition, and {{was impressed with the}} Mohave guides, later noting Irataba's enthusiastic handshake and lamenting that their only form of communication was sign language. He also noted that Irataba and the Mohave readily began wearing European clothes given to them by members of the expedition, and showed great interest in smoking tobacco. Aside from the friendship shown to him by Irataba and Cairook, Ives noted that the Mohave appeared less friendly than on earlier occasions, a change that he attributed to their contact with Mormons, who were in conflict with the US and had succeeded in converting some Mohave.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} 1821 paper he co-authored with Henry De la Beche on {{ichthyosaur}} anatomy, William Conybeare named {{and described the}} genus Plesiosaurus (near lizard), called so {{because he thought it}} more like modern reptiles than the ichthyosaur had been. The description was based on a number of fossils, the most complete of them specimen OUMNH J.50146, <b>a</b> <b>paddle</b> and vertebral column that had been obtained by Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas James Birch. Christopher McGowan has hypothesised that this specimen had originally been much more complete and had been collected by Anning, during the winter of 1820/1821. If so, it would have been Anning's next major discovery, providing essential information about the newly recognised type of marine reptile. No records by Anning of the find are known. The paper thanked Birch for giving Conybeare access to it, but does not mention who discovered and prepared it.|$|E
5|$|Mario & Sonic on the Wii and DS is a {{collection}} of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. Players can assume the role of a Nintendo or Sega character while competing against the others in these events. Players use the Wii Remote to mimic actions performed in real life sports, such as swinging <b>a</b> <b>paddle.</b> The DS version uses the stylus and button controls. Both games closely follow rules and regulations of the specific sports. Sega adopted the IOC's mission of promoting a sporting spirit and its desire to interest young people in the Olympics by using its characters. Due to this atmosphere of competitive sportsmanship, Sega received approval by Nintendo to include Mario in the game with Sonic. Sonic the Hedgehog is the protagonist of the video game series released by Sega in order to provide the company with a mascot to rival Nintendo's flagship character Mario in the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|The naval Battle of Jasmund (also {{known as}} the Battle of Rügen) took place between {{elements}} of the Danish and Prussian navies on 17 March 1864 during the Second Schleswig War. The action took place east of the Jasmund peninsula on the Prussian island of Rügen, during a Prussian attempt to weaken the Danish blockade in the Baltic Sea. The Prussian squadron, commanded by Eduard von Jachmann, sortied with two steam corvettes, <b>a</b> <b>paddle</b> steamer, and six gunboats to attack the Danish squadron blockading the eastern Prussian coast. The Danish force was commanded by Edvard van Dockum, and it consisted of one steam frigate, one ship of the line, and two steam corvettes. In an action lasting two hours, the superior Danish squadron forced the Prussians to withdraw, both sides suffering damage and light casualties. The Danish victory was compounded {{by the arrival of}} further warships after the battle, which cemented the blockade. The outcome of the battle, and the naval war in the Baltic as a whole, was irrelevant to the outcome of the war, however, as the Prussian and Austrian armies decisively defeated the Danes on land, forcing them to surrender.|$|E
