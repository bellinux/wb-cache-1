25|$|On Christmas Eve in Manhattan's East Village, two roommates—Mark, a filmmaker, and Roger, a rock musician—struggle to {{stay warm}} and produce their art ("Tune Up #1"). Mark's mother leaves him a {{voicemail}} wishing him <b>a</b> <b>merry</b> <b>Christmas</b> and trying to comfort him since his ex-girlfriend Maureen dumped him ("Voice Mail #1"). Their friend Collins, a gay anarchist Ivy League tutor, calls and plans to surprise them at their apartment, but is mugged before entering. At the same time, Mark and Roger's former roommate Benny, who has since become their harsh new landlord, has reneged on an earlier agreement and now demands last year's rent, before shutting down their electrical power ("Tune Up #2"). However, Mark and Roger rebel and pledge to not pay the rent they were promised wouldn't be a problem ("Rent"). Meanwhile, a cross-dressing street drummer (currently out of drag) named Angel finds Collins wounded in an alley and tends to him ("You Okay Honey?"). The two are immediately attracted to each other, and learn that they are both HIV positive. Roger also has HIV which he contracted from his last girlfriend, who committed suicide, causing Roger to fall into a deep depression. Mark goes looking for Collins ("Tune Up #3"), while Roger wishes to write one last song to be remembered by before he dies ("One Song Glory"). An exotic dancer, junkie, and neighbor, Mimi, shows up to flirt with Roger, but he is clearly hesitant {{to start a new}} relationship ("Light My Candle"). Meanwhile, Joanne, a lawyer and Maureen's girlfriend, receives a voicemail from her parents ("Voice Mail #2").|$|E

500|$|Welles used an aural {{technique}} {{from radio}} called the [...] "lightning-mix". Welles used this technique to link complex montage sequences via {{a series of}} related sounds or phrases. For example, Kane grows from a child into {{a young man in}} just two shots. As Thatcher hands eight-year-old Kane a sled and wishes him <b>a</b> <b>Merry</b> <b>Christmas,</b> the sequence suddenly jumps to a shot of Thatcher fifteen years later, completing the sentence he began in both the previous shot and the chronological past. Other radio techniques include using a number of voices, each saying a sentence or sometimes merely a fragment of a sentence, and splicing the dialogue together in quick succession, such as the projection room scene. The film's sound cost $16,996, but was originally budgeted at $7,288.|$|E

2500|$|Also in 1843, Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol was published, {{during the}} mid Victorian {{revival of the}} holiday. The word Merry was then {{beginning}} to take on its current meaning of [...] "jovial, cheerful, jolly and outgoing". [...] "Merry Christmas" [...] in this new context figured prominently in A Christmas Carol. The cynical Ebenezer Scrooge rudely deflects the friendly greeting: [...] "If I could work my will … every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding." [...] After the visit from the Ghosts of Christmas affects his transformation, Scrooge exclaims; [...] "I am as merry as a school-boy. <b>A</b> <b>merry</b> <b>Christmas</b> to everybody!" [...] and heartily exchanges the wish to all he meets. The instant popularity of A Christmas Carol, the Victorian era Christmas traditions it typifies, and the term's new meaning appearing in the book popularized the phrase [...] "Merry Christmas".|$|E
