2500|$|.....crystallized {{the essence}} of the band. It had {{everything}} there and showed the band at its best... as a band, as a unit. Not talking about solos or anything, it had everything there. We were careful never to release it as a single. It was a milestone for us. Every musician wants to do something of lasting quality, something which will hold up for a long time <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> did it with [...] "Stairway". [...] Townshend probably thought that he got it with Tommy. I don't know whether I have the ability to come up with more. I {{have to do a lot}} of hard work before I can get anywhere near those stages of consistent, total brilliance.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Lapham {{was silent}} a while. [...] "No," [...] she said finally; [...] "we've always got along well enough here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> better stay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{there are}} three of us here besides yourself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> would all take {{a hand in the}} game. What do you say, mates?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, no; to be sure, I {{can have}} it, {{and may be}} it's the best of any time, {{if we can get}} Black Dinah to come and help about the cakes <b>and</b> pies. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> will, finally." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Waal," [...] he said, [...] "I {{guess that}} what the lady says goes. We ain't often favoured with ladies' society, boys, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> when <b>we</b> are we'd better do as we are told. Turn 'em loose, boys." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There'll be {{no trouble}} after we've bought the concession," [...] Cliffe continued. [...] "The cash will {{then go to}} the treasury, and {{whichever}} party gets control will have to stand to the bargain. <b>And</b> now <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> can let the matter drop until I fix things up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] said Mrs. Deering, [...] "I don't know as {{we shall}} trouble him, after all. Mr. Deering isn't very well, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> have got to go home--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, she isn't so bad. She's pretty lively, but she's very {{eager to}} learn the business, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> shall get along. I think she wants to please me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we'll {{have the}} party just the same, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> can manage {{to have a}} good time even if Mr. Si Kelly does not permit the boys to come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] demanded Hal. [...] "I {{can get a}} {{pass for}} him, <b>and</b> between us <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> {{can take care of}} him. It won't cost him a cent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... " [...] He {{may come}} up-stairs; {{but how can}} he find you? See here, Ned, I've got two tickets for the passage in my pocket, an' the room's been {{paid for by the}} man I told you about. Now we can keep in here till the boat stops, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> can give him the slip; but I hain't thought yet how we either of us can get home." ...|$|R
5000|$|Little: [...] "Yeah, I think you're right. I think, {{you know}} .... When Geoffrey {{had done so}} much {{research}} on the Malmedy massacre, and presented it as the idea .... There are so many accounts about what happened. And, you know, it's interesting. We didn't know exactly where to kinda, you know, what point of view to take <b>and</b> so <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> all, as we discussed it, we kinda decided that maybe more of a kinda neutral approach." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It doesn't matter," [...] {{observed}} Phil. [...] "We {{know he is}} on board, and he can't {{get away}} until we land, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> can root him out before that time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you go on, then," [...] put in Jack quickly. [...] "There {{are five}} of us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> {{can take care}} of ourselves, {{especially}} as we have our guns with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you must}} try to {{interest}} him in something. Get him to talking, and then let Mrs. Stephson {{come in with a}} good bowl of broth, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> may trust Nature to do the rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{man with}} the leveled shot-gun drawled, [...] "I'm the deputy sheriff for this {{locality}} and I'll give you dirty bums just five minutes to pick up your duffle and git out, <b>and</b> keep a-going. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> don't need you around here. You been robbing every hen-roost for ten miles. Now step lively, and no funny business." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tom Fogerty died at {{his home}} in Scottsdale, Arizona in September 1990 of an AIDS complication, which he {{contracted}} via a tainted blood transfusion he received while undergoing back surgery. Tom and John barely reconciled before Tom's death, and in the eulogy that he delivered at Tom's funeral, John said, [...] "We wanted to grow up <b>and</b> be musicians. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> achieved half of that, becoming rock 'n roll stars. We didn't necessarily grow up." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1990 Tom Fogerty died of AIDS (specifically from a {{tuberculosis}} infection) {{at the age}} of 48, having contracted HIV from {{blood transfusions}} for back ailments. Fogerty has mentioned that the darkest moments in his life were when his brother took the record company's side in their royalties dispute, and the fact that when his brother died, {{the two of them were}} not speaking to each other. In the eulogy he delivered at Tom's funeral, he said: [...] "We wanted to grow up <b>and</b> be musicians. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> achieved half of that, becoming rock 'n roll stars. We didn't necessarily grow up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was just}} {{the right thing to}} do, Dave," [...] was Ben's comment. [...] "But I don't know that I would have thought of it. You are a quick thinker, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> have you to thank for saving our lives." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, {{we never}} got a sight of that fruit tub on the road. The ocean is a pretty big place; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> took {{different}} paths across it. But we kept going toward this Anchuria, where the fruiter was bound for.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Whitwell, [...] "time {{enough to}} think about all that. We got two good months yet to plan it out before Jackson gets back, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> can think of {{something}} before that. I presume," [...] he added, thoughtfully, [...] "that when Mrs. Durgin hears that you've give Jeff the sack, she'll make consid'able of a kick. She done it when you got engaged." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{might not}} have said so then, that is likely enough; one can't always tell whether a {{yearling}} {{is going to turn}} out a good horse, and a good many who think they are clever get sucked in over it; but a man who has an eye to horseflesh can tell whether a three-year-old is well bred or not, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> am not far out with this one. Yes, I am struck over her. It is not often that women, or men either for that matter, get on the soft side of me. You know pretty well that I wasn't afraid of running a bit of risk in the old days, and you may guess that this country doesn't make a baby of one. No, sir, I have seen pistols and knives out pretty often since <b>I</b> came here, <b>and</b> would use them myself if there was any occasion, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that if <b>we</b> ever get into a mess you will find I shall play my part as well as you do; only I want it clearly understood that in this job we are going in for I am ready to go through it whatever comes; but I am fixed in my mind {{that we are going to}} act straight to that girl.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} on Spin, Clarkson revealed that she had found out about Tokio Hotel's version three days after releasing hers. She remarked, [...] "I was just talking to my assistant about it, like, 'Man, I gotta reach out to them about it!' I didn't cover them, because the only time I'd ever heard that song was from my publisher, who sent it to me <b>and</b> said, 'Hey, <b>I</b> have this demo with a piano and a vocal from David Jost,' one of the writers. That's the only way I {{knew it was the}} song. I didn't know it was already out there, so that was really fun finding out". She also added, [...] "It's a great song so I could see why another band would wanna sing it. It's so good <b>and</b> intense, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> have the duet version." [...] Clarkson later posted on social networking site Twitter saying that she wasn't given all the information needed and that it looked like she had ripped them off as she would never do that to any artist. While Tokio Hotel offered their salutations and replied that they have received Clarkson's version weeks before it was released as her record label RCA Records had asked them for their publishing information.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's her!" [...] said William Trotter, looking. [...] "She's come back! I'm obliged; but I can't {{take the}} job. Thanks, just the same. Ain't it funny how we can't {{do nothing for}} ourselves, but we can do wonders for the other fellow? You {{was about to get}} me with your {{financial}} proposition; but we've all got our weak points. Timotea's mine. And, say!" [...] Trotter had turned to leave, but he retraced the step or two that he had taken. [...] "I like to have left you without saying good-bye," [...] said he. [...] "It kind of rattles you when they go away unexpected for a month and come back the same way. Shake hands. So long! Say, do you remember them gunshots we heard a while ago up at the cuartel? Well, I knew what they was, but I didn't mention it. It was Clifford Wainwright being shot by a squad of soldiers against a stone wall for giving away secrets of state to that Nicamala republic. Oh, yes, it was rum that did it. He backslided <b>and</b> got his. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> all have our weak points, and can't do much toward helping ourselves. Mine's waiting for me. I'd have liked to have that job with your brother, but--we've all got our weak points. So long!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just as {{you please}} about that," [...] said Mrs. Durgin, with the same impassioned quiet that showed in her son's {{handsome}} face and made it one angry red to his yellow hair. [...] "We've got along without you so far, this summer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> can {{the rest of the}} time. And the sooner you work off your conditions the better, I presume." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess we}} can carry out, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> shan't {{want to send}} any excuse," [...] bragged the Colonel. [...] "If we're {{ever going to be}} anybody at all, we've got to go and see how it's done. I presume we've got to give some sort of party when we get into the new house, and this gives the chance to ask 'em back again. You can't {{complain}} now but what they've made the advances, Persis?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you sure?" [...] asked Mrs. Quack anxiously. [...] "I've been fooled {{too often}} by men with their terrible guns to ever feel {{absolutely}} sure that one isn't hiding {{and waiting to}} shoot me." [...] As she spoke she swam about nervously. [...] "Peter Rabbit and I have been here ever since you left, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> ought to know," [...] replied Jerry Muskrat rather shortly. [...] "There hasn't been anybody near here excepting Farmer Brown's boy, and we told you he wouldn't hurt you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Orson {{apparently}} {{could not}} {{enter into the}} joke; but he accompanied the party, which again began to forget him, across the ferry and up the elevated road to the street car that formed the last stage of their progress to the hotel. At this point George's sister fell silent, and Clementina's father burst out, [...] "Look he'a! <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> betty not keep this up any Tonga; I don't believe much in surprises, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> she betta know it now!" ...|$|R
60|$|Charles. Have we? Well never mind, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> shall find them.|$|R
5000|$|Oh, <b>I</b> <b>Guess</b> <b>We</b> Were A Fucking Surf Band After All... (2016 Yep Roc Records) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'll {{do better}} than that for you," [...] he answered, {{thrusting}} his hand into his waistcoat pocket and drawing out a pile of dollar bills. [...] "Let's look at you. Gee whiz! Yes, you're shabby, aren't you? Take this," [...] he went on, slamming some notes down before her. [...] "Go and get yourself a new frock and a hat fit to wear, and meet me at the Madison Square roof garden at eight o'clock. We'll have some dinner <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> can fix matters up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all. I {{believe we}} can furbish them up {{sufficiently}} to make the room habitable. It will be rather old-fashioned, but then it's Hobson's choice. There are the pieces of an old bed out in the loft, {{and they can be}} put together. There's an old corner cupboard out there too, with leaded glass doors, two old solid wooden armchairs, and a funny old chest of drawers with a writing desk in place of the top drawer, all full of yellow old letters and trash. I found it under a pile of old carpet. Then there's a washstand, and also a towel rack up in the garret, and the funniest old table with three claw legs, and a tippy top. One leg is broken off, but I hunted around and found it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> can fix it on. And there are two more old chairs and a queer little oval table with a cracked swing mirror on it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everybody is here now, Bessie, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> {{may as well}} {{sit down}} to supper," [...] said Col. Zane. [...] "And, good friends, {{let me say that}} this is an {{occasion}} for rejoicing. It {{is not so much a}} marriage that I mean. That we might have any day if Lydia or Betty would show some of the alacrity which got a good husband for Alice. Isaac is a free man and we expect his marriage will bring about peace with a powerful tribe of Indians. To us, and particularly to you, young people, that is a matter of great importance. The friendship of the Hurons cannot but exert an influence on other tribes. I, myself, may live to see the day that my dream shall be realized--peaceful and friendly relations with the Indians, the freedom of the soil, well-tilled farms and growing settlements, and at last, the opening of this glorious country to the world. Therefore, let us rejoice; let every one be happy; let your gayest laugh ring out, and tell your best story." ...|$|E
60|$|She. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> weren't ever {{meant to}} see these old tombs from inside, anyway.|$|R
6000|$|... "'It {{would be}} dreadful naughty,' began Nelly, 'but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> will,' she added, as the sweet mouthful slipped down her throat.|$|R
6000|$|... “Well,” resumed {{the elder}} {{traveller}} after a while, “if his house {{is as good}} as his cigars <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> shall muddle through.” ...|$|R
