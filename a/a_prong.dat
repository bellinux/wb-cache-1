6000|$|... 'His name is Paul Blackthorn,' said Harold; 'and he's the queerest chap I {{ever came}} across. Why, he knew no more {{what to do}} with <b>a</b> <b>prong</b> than the farmer's old sow till I shewed him.' ...|$|E
60|$|Poor Nunaga, in the trusting {{simplicity}} of her nature, was {{strong in the}} belief that, having been found and saved by Angut, there was no further cause for anxiety. With an easy mind, therefore, she set herself to the present duty of spearing cat fish with <b>a</b> <b>prong.</b>|$|E

50|$|Ajax - A large sorrel gelding {{given to}} Marse Roberts after he injures his hands. Rarely used {{due to his}} size. Died after Lee's {{retirement}} from injuries sustained from <b>a</b> sharp <b>prong</b> on <b>a</b> gate latch.|$|R
60|$|He fitted {{the book}} roughly into his inner pocket and, {{stubbing}} his toes against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily {{down the stairs}} with a flurried stork's legs. Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan. By prodding <b>a</b> <b>prong</b> of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back. Only a little burnt. He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.|$|E
60|$|Benares is the Mecca of the Hindoos, and {{the number}} of pilgrims who visit it is incalculable. Casi (its ancient name, {{signifying}} splendid), is alleged to be no part of this world, which rests on eternity, whereas Benares is perched on <b>a</b> <b>prong</b> of Siva's trident, and is hence beyond the reach of earthquakes.* [Probably an allusion to the infrequency of these phenomena in this meridian; they being common both in Eastern Bengal, and in Western India beyond the Ganges.] Originally built of gold, the sins of the inhabitants were punished by its transmutation into stone, and latterly into mud and thatch: whoever enters it, and especially visits its principal idol (Siva fossilised) is secure of heaven.|$|E
60|$|It was toward three o'clock, and {{a little}} snow was sifting down between the somber {{branches}} overhead, when Lisle, stopping, raised a warning hand and pointed to {{an opening in the}} trees. The light was dim among the rows of trunks, and for a few seconds Nasmyth gazed down the long colonnade, seeing nothing. Then Lisle pointed again, impatiently, and he made out something between a gray trunk and a thicket. Sportsman as he was, he had not the bush-man's eye, and he would never have supposed that formless object to be a deer. It moved, however; <b>a</b> <b>prong</b> of horn appeared; and waiting for nothing further he pitched up his rifle.|$|E
50|$|In Delaware {{squeeze-out}} mergers {{are subject}} to <b>a</b> two <b>prong</b> entire fairness test. The test focuses on the fairness of both the transaction's price {{and the process of}} approval. The two prongs are fair price and fair dealing.|$|R
50|$|M2 = 3 short <b>prongs,</b> <b>a</b> base disc {{to secure}} the grenade, and solid tailfins.|$|R
30|$|The distal {{portion of}} the palpus to the median {{apophysis}} is less pleated and is slightly sclerotized, so we considered subtegulum the more distal and less sclerotized portion that bears the fundus, and tegulum the more apical and sclerotized portion. In Opell's revision ([1979]), he identified tegulum as the distal surface which arises from the median apophysis, and the remaining area of the distal portion were left unnamed. Here, no visible differentiation that would let the area of hematodocha be identified more clearly was found. In Ariston species, the median apophysis is present and can be an elongated projection without <b>prongs</b> (<b>A.</b> mazolus), with one <b>prong</b> (<b>A.</b> albicans and A. aristus), or three <b>prongs</b> (<b>A.</b> spartanus n. sp.).|$|R

40|$|This {{study will}} {{evaluate}} an alternative method in which <b>a</b> four <b>prong</b> bone staple {{was used to}} repair the medial collateral ligament following over-release or avulsion injuries in (# 6) cases during a total knee arthroplasty. The use of <b>a</b> four <b>prong</b> bone staple to repair medial collateral ligament injuries status post total knee replacement will provide satisfactory results with respect to post-operative knee stability and range of motion. Our retrospective review revealed that all six patients improved with regards to range of motion following the total knee arthroplasty. We feel that repair of the medial collateral ligament with a four-prong bone staple is a viable option after an over-release or avulsion injury sustained during a total knee arthroplasty...|$|R
50|$|Before pouring the water, torturers often {{inserted}} <b>an</b> iron <b>prong</b> (known as the bostezo) into a victim's {{mouth to}} keep it open, {{as well as a}} strip of linen (known as the toca) on which the victim would choke and suffocate while swallowing the water.|$|R
5000|$|For {{mid-range}} weapons, {{the knife}} was tested against the trident and net. The knife's versatility was demonstrated when Snake Blocker threw three knives at three targets in under three seconds. Snake Blocker also demonstrated Apache knife fighting techniques, {{such as the}} [...] "piercing buffalo", on a dummy garbed as a gladiator and wearing a gladiator's helmet. The trident, wielded by Chris Torres, was then tested on a gel torso and managed to puncture its heart with the main <b>prong,</b> <b>a</b> side <b>prong</b> puncturing the spleen. The trident and net was given the edge due to its flexibility as an offensive-defensive combo.|$|R
50|$|The municipality’s arms {{might be}} {{described}} thus: Argent three ears of wheat in fess palewise vert surmounted at the nombril point by <b>a</b> <b>prong</b> hoe fesswise sable.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>prong</b> setting offers less {{protection}} to the gem than inset mounts. [...] In addition, prongs can snag on clothing or fabric. [...] High quality settings {{are less likely}} to snag on clothing, as the prongs are firmly attached to the gem and well finished.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Schematic {{diagrams}} of Ottoia sclerite morphologies. Sclerites {{comprise a}} broad, flat basal pad and a thickened, usually triangular arch. Denticles {{arise from the}} lateral margins of the arch; distal extension of the arch gives rise to <b>a</b> <b>prong.</b> An oblique spur arises from the basal region.|$|E
50|$|The sai {{eventually}} reached Japan in {{the form}} of the jitte, which usually has only <b>a</b> single <b>prong</b> although some jitte have two <b>prongs</b> like <b>a</b> sai. Both are like truncheon weapons, used for striking, bludgeoning, and also for multiple punctures over different positions on the body.|$|R
5000|$|Tapejara (from a Tupi {{word meaning}} [...] "the old being") is a genus of Brazilian {{pterosaur}} from the Cretaceous Period (Santana Formation, dating to about 112 Ma ago). Tapejara crests {{consisted of a}} semicircular crest over the snout, and <b>a</b> bony <b>prong</b> which extended back behind the head.|$|R
50|$|The sai (釵) is a {{traditional}} piercing melee weapon used in Okinawa. The basic form of the weapon is that of <b>a</b> pointed, <b>prong</b> shaped metal baton, with two curved prongs (yoku) projecting from the handle (tsuka). There are many types of sai with varying prongs for trapping and blocking.|$|R
5000|$|The Talmud {{describes}} arrow {{heads and}} mating shafts as potentially being either male or female, {{depending on their}} construction, i.e. <b>a</b> <b>prong</b> on a male arrow head fits into a hollowed out shaft and vice versa. This is owing to a prohibition on a female shaft, from its susceptibility as a receptacle for impurity, for use as s'chach ...|$|E
50|$|An early {{exception}} to {{these types of}} bases is the Peanut 215, which instead of using prongs had a tiny bayonet base with four drop-like contacts. Another exception is the European Side Contact series commonly known as P, which instead of using <b>a</b> <b>prong,</b> relied on side contacts at 90 degrees from the tube axis with four to twelve contacts.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{subsections}} of the New England Uplands {{in addition}} to the Reading Prong. <b>A</b> <b>prong</b> of the same rock belt extends from the Hudson Highlands south to New York City along the Hudson River. This region {{is often referred to as}} the Manhattan Prong. The Staten Island Sepentinite is also a southward extension of the New England Uplands.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: X4474, a late {{production}} Mk I of 19 Squadron {{flown by}} Sergeant Jennings in September 1940. The absence of <b>a</b> triangular <b>prong</b> {{on the rear}} of the mast indicates that VHF radio was fitted. The voltage regulator can be seen under the rear transparency. This photo makes a good comparison with K9795.|$|R
50|$|M1A1 = 3 <b>prongs,</b> <b>a</b> base cup {{to secure}} the grenade, and solid tailfins. It was {{designed}} to launch oval-shaped grenades like the M26 Fragmentation Grenade.|$|R
25|$|This equipment, {{consisting}} of a rest with a single extended neck and <b>a</b> fork-like <b>prong</b> at the end, is used to give extra cueing distance over a group of balls. If not available, a regular X rest can be placed on a spider so it in turn hangs the required distance beyond to provide similar support.|$|R
50|$|Buckles {{were not}} entirely {{made out of}} leather because a frame and bar of leather would not be {{substantial}} enough to carry <b>a</b> <b>prong</b> or {{the full weight of}} the belt and anything the belt and buckle intend to support. However, leather (or dyed suede, more common to match a lady’s garment color) was used more as a “cover-up” for cheap materials to create a product worthy of buying.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "tiger hook swords" [...] or qian kun ri yue dao (literally [...] "Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon sword"), these weapons have a sharp blade {{similar to the}} jian, though {{possibly}} thicker or sometimes unsharpened, with <b>a</b> <b>prong</b> or hook (similar to a shepherd's crook) near the tip. Guards are substantial, {{in the style of}} butterfly swords. Often used in pairs, the hooks of the weapons may be used to trap or deflect other weapons.|$|E

Blotched and swollen from the never-ending attack of flies and mosquitoes his face seemed twice its natural size, and it ached and stung.|$|R
50|$|M1A2 = 3 <b>prongs,</b> <b>a</b> base cup {{to secure}} the grenade, and slotted tailfins. It was an {{improved}} version of the M1A1 with a reinforced tube and redesigned tailfins.|$|R
50|$|Butterfly clutch - One of {{the most}} popular modern methods of {{attaching}} pins is the butterfly clutch, sometimes called a military clutch. The back of the pin has <b>a</b> small <b>prong</b> attached and when the butterfly clutch is squeezed and pulled up from the prong the pin is released from the clutch. Butterfly clutches may be made out of metal, plastic, or rubber.|$|R
