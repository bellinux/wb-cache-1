5|$|Critics say the MFP formula discourages {{high levels}} of local, rather than state, funding.

Tulane University's Cowen Institute was founded in 2007 to examine the effects of local tax initiatives on the MFP. Tara O'Neill, Cowen Institute Policy Manager, said districts receive extra incentive funding from the state when they raise high amounts of funding at the local level. O'Neill said districts get this extra money whether they tax <b>a</b> <b>low</b> tax base at a high rate or tax a healthy tax base at <b>a</b> <b>low</b> rate.|$|E
