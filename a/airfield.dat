5|$|Penshurst <b>Airfield</b> was an <b>airfield</b> in {{operation}} between 1916–36 and 1940–46. Initially a military <b>airfield,</b> after the First World War {{it was used}} as an alternate destination to Croydon Airport, with some civil flying taking place. The <b>airfield</b> closed following the crash of a Flying Flea at an air display in 1936, and was converted to a polo ground.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July, the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division {{conducted}} Operation Windsor, {{to seize}} Carpiquet and the adjacent <b>airfield</b> from the 12th SS-Panzer Division. Carpiquet fell on 5 July, the <b>airfield</b> remained in German hands.|$|E
5|$|Saint-Inglevert <b>Airfield</b> is {{a general}} {{aviation}} <b>airfield</b> at Saint-Inglevert, Pas-de-Calais, France. In the First World War an <b>airfield</b> was established near Saint-Inglevert by the Royal Flying Corps, later passing to the Royal Air Force on formation and thus becoming RAF Saint Inglevert.|$|E
50|$|The {{missions}} {{were carried}} {{away from a}} well developed network of air bases and other <b>airfields.</b> By the early 1970s, in the Angolan theatre there was a central air base, two sector air bases, eight satellite <b>airfields</b> and nine other <b>airfields.</b> In the Guinean theatre there was a central air base, three satellite <b>airfields</b> and other three <b>airfields.</b> In the Mozambican theatre, there was a central air base, four sector air bases, seven satellite <b>airfields</b> and five other <b>airfields.</b> Besides these, there was {{a high number of}} other air fields and runways, with almost all isolated military garrisons having their own. The air connections between the theatres and European Portugal were further supported by transit <b>airfields</b> in São Tomé Island, São Tomé and Príncipe and in Sal Island, Cape Verde.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Airfields</b> {{around the}} country are said to have paranormal {{activity}} arising from the spirits of airmen who died in World War II. <b>Airfields</b> include: ...|$|R
5|$|In some countries, {{the need}} for more land for housing is {{threatening}} small <b>airfields.</b> These <b>airfields</b> may also be used for other general aviation activities, and the addition of gliding may be difficult to accommodate. This can limit the number of available <b>airfields</b> and so it can require longer drives to reach them.|$|R
5|$|The 24th Brigade's {{goal for}} 11 June was {{to secure the}} <b>airfield</b> area. The 2/43rd Battalion patrolled {{to the north and}} west of the <b>airfield</b> during the day, meeting only light opposition. In contrast, the 2/28th Battalion (which was tasked with {{advancing}} into Labuan's interior) encountered entrenched Japanese forces, and it became clear that it was facing {{the main body of the}} island's garrison. Norman manoeuvred his companies to push the Japanese back, but the rate of advance was slow. The <b>airfield</b> engineers of No. 62 Wing RAAF were also landed during 11 June to begin work on returning No. 1 Strip to service; reconstruction of the <b>airfield</b> began the next day.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Suwon <b>Airfield</b> was {{the first}} aerial battle of the Korean War {{occurring}} on June 27, 1950 over Kimpo <b>Airfield</b> and Suwon <b>Airfield.</b> The battle, between aircraft of the United States and North Korea, ended in {{a victory for the}} US Air Force after nine of its aircraft successfully shot down seven North Korean People's Air Force aircraft. It {{was the first}} direct engagement of the Air Battle of South Korea.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{were taken}} by surprise, and by nightfall on 8 August the 11,000 Allied troops—under the command of Lieutenant General Alexander Vandegrift—secured Tulagi and nearby small islands {{as well as an}} <b>airfield</b> under {{construction}} at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal. The Allies later renamed the <b>airfield</b> Henderson Field. To protect the <b>airfield,</b> the U.S. Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point. Additional reinforcements over the next two months later increased the number of U.S. troops at Lunga Point to more than 20,000.|$|E
5000|$|Several <b>airfields</b> {{had their}} runways widened and {{extended}} in length for emergency landing of damaged bombers after operations over Germany, these <b>airfields,</b> RAF Woodbridge, RAF Carnaby, and RAF Manston being designated as [...] "Emergency Landing Grounds" [...] - ELG's. These ELG <b>airfields</b> {{had some of}} the first fitments of the fog-dispersing installation, FIDO.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, {{the firm}} helped {{camouflage}} American <b>airfields</b> from enemy planes. Sketches of orchards and farm buildings were {{painted on the}} <b>airfields</b> to confuse the enemy.|$|R
5000|$|... 11 Group was {{organised}} {{using the}} Dowding System of fighter control. Group Headquarters was at Hillingdon House within RAF Uxbridge. The Group operations room was underground {{in what is}} now known as the Battle of Britain Bunker. Commands were passed to the sector <b>airfields,</b> each of which was in charge of several <b>airfields</b> and fighter squadrons. The sector <b>airfields</b> were: ...|$|R
5|$|The Marines ashore on Guadalcanal {{initially}} {{concentrated on}} forming a defense perimeter around the <b>airfield,</b> moving the landed supplies within the perimeter, and finishing the <b>airfield.</b> Vandegrift placed his 11,000 troops on Guadalcanal {{in a loose}} perimeter around the Lunga Point area. In four days of intense effort, the supplies were moved from the landing beach into dispersed dumps within the perimeter. Work began on the <b>airfield</b> immediately, mainly using captured Japanese equipment. On August 12, the <b>airfield</b> was named Henderson Field after Major Lofton Henderson, a Marine aviator {{who had been killed}} at the Battle of Midway. Captured Japanese stock increased the total supply of food to 14 days worth. To conserve the limited food supplies, the Allied troops were limited to two meals per day.|$|E
5|$|There {{are more}} than a dozen golf clubs in the Riding {{including}} the cliff-top course at Flamborough. The Royal Yorkshire Yacht Club is based at Bridlington, and flying and gliding take place from Pocklington <b>airfield</b> and Eddsfield <b>airfield.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Luftwaffes plan {{of attack}} was simple. German bombers were to strike at the RAF <b>airfields</b> in the {{south-east}} corner of England. The most important <b>airfields</b> in this region, {{under the command of}} AOC (Air Officer Commanding) Keith Park and his No. 11 Group RAF, were the Sector Stations at RAF Kenley, Biggin Hill, Hornchurch, North Weald, Northolt, Tangmere and Debden. The first five were on the periphery of Greater London. Tangmere was in the south near the coast at Chichester, while Debden was in the north near Saffron Walden. Each of these <b>airfields</b> housed two to three squadrons and had its own sector operations room. From there, its fighters were directed from its satellite <b>airfields</b> into combat. There were six satellite <b>airfields</b> at Westhampnett, Croydon, Gravesend, Manston, Rochford and RAF Martlesham Heath; Manston and Martlesham Heath each housed two squadrons, the remainder each housed one. Finally, there was RAF Hawkinge, just inland from Folkestone. Not all of these <b>airfields</b> were targeted on 18 August.|$|R
50|$|The <b>airfields</b> {{recently}} constructed at Leyte {{were deemed}} unreliable, so potential additional <b>airfields</b> in Mindoro appealed to General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, the commanding general of this theater of operations.|$|R
50|$|By 15 September 1944, IX Engineer Command {{had placed}} over eighty ALG <b>airfields</b> in operation, while British {{engineers}} had constructed 76 <b>airfields</b> in their zone. In Southern France, another {{twenty or so}} fields had been built by American engineers from Twelfth Air Force from the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO). In October these uncoded <b>airfields</b> {{were assigned to the}} ETO and given ALG code numbers.|$|R
5|$|XV401 Bentwaters <b>Airfield,</b> Woodbridge, Suffolk, England.|$|E
5|$|A World War II {{plane crash}} site is also near the <b>airfield.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the early}} 20th century, few fortifications {{were built in}} Malta. However, new {{military}} installations such as airfields began {{to be built in}} World War I, when the seaplane base of RAF Kalafrana and the <b>airfield</b> at Marsa were built. More airfields were built in the interwar period and the Second World War, including RAF Hal Far, RAF Ta Kali, RAF Luqa, RAF Safi, RAF Krendi and Ta' Lambert <b>Airfield.</b>|$|E
50|$|Oregon World War II Army <b>Airfields</b> {{were the}} <b>airfields</b> built or {{repurposed}} during World War II for training pilots and aircrews of United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) fighters and bombers in Oregon.|$|R
50|$|Post war {{many were}} removed from {{temporary}} wartime <b>airfields</b> as they closed or downsized for civilian use and were relocated to expand or consolidate the permanent RAAF bases, or to establish new civilian <b>airfields.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The first {{operational}} Lightning, designated Lightning F.1, {{was designed}} as an interceptor to defend the V Force <b>airfields</b> {{in conjunction with the}} V Force <b>airfield's</b> own [...] "last ditch" [...] Bristol Bloodhound missile defences from enemy nuclear-armed bomber attack long enough for the also nuclear-armed V Force bombers to take-off and get clear of their <b>airfields,</b> <b>airfields</b> which, along with the dispersal <b>airfields,</b> would be the highest priority targets in the UK for enemy nuclear weapons. To best perform this intercept mission, emphasis was placed on rate-of-climb, acceleration, and speed, rather than range – originally a radius of operation of 150 miles from the V bomber <b>airfields</b> was specified – and combat endurance. It was equipped with two 30mm ADEN cannon in front of the cockpit windscreen and an interchangeable fuselage weapons pack containing either an additional two ADEN cannon, 48 [...] unguided air-to-air rockets, or two de Havilland Firestreak air-to-air missiles; a heavy loadout optimised for damaging large aircraft, missile guidance and ranging, as well as search and track functions, mainly were provided via the Ferranti AI.23 onboard radar.|$|R
5|$|After their {{training}} had been completed, on 17 November the sappers were transported to an RAF <b>airfield</b> at Skitten in Scotland, with the operation scheduled to commence two days later. On {{the evening of}} 19 November, Group Captain Cooper, {{with the aid of}} a Norwegian meteorologist and regular reports from the SOE agents stationed near the landing zone, decided that although the weather was not perfect, it would be best to launch the operation that night; Cooper believed that if it were delayed, the weather might deteriorate on subsequent days and prevent the operation from being conducted entirely. The first aircraft–glider combination took off from the <b>airfield</b> at 17:50, with the second following at 18:10; after circling the <b>airfield</b> several times the two combinations headed out across the North Sea towards their objective.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces {{landed on}} Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942 and seized an <b>airfield,</b> later called Henderson Field, that was under {{construction}} by the Japanese military. There were several subsequent {{attempts by the}} Imperial Japanese Army and Navy, using reinforcements delivered to Guadalcanal by ship, to recapture the <b>airfield,</b> which ultimately failed. In early November 1942, the Japanese organized a transport convoy to take 7,000 infantry troops and their equipment to Guadalcanal to attempt once again to retake the <b>airfield.</b> Several Japanese warship forces were assigned to bombard Henderson Field {{with the goal of}} destroying Allied aircraft that posed a threat to the convoy. Learning of the Japanese reinforcement effort, U.S. forces launched aircraft and warship attacks to defend Henderson Field and prevent the Japanese ground troops from reaching Guadalcanal.|$|E
5|$|As a {{licensed}} <b>airfield</b> Duxford {{has its own}} Fire Service (currently five vehicles, and 16 fire fighters / officers) which operates {{as part of the}} <b>Airfield</b> & Security department, the fire service was originally operated by voluntary crews who were part of Duxford Aviation Society, with the training officers coming from Stansted and other local airports, {{for the last few years}} it has been a mixed voluntary/full-time operation.|$|E
50|$|During the {{build-up}} to the Second World War, the Air Ministry began constructing major <b>airfields</b> {{across the}} United Kingdom under {{what was known}} as the Expansion Period. RAF Little Rissington was one of these <b>airfields.</b>|$|R
50|$|Luftflotte 3's radio {{intercepts}} of Bomber Command's transmissions helped {{pinpoint the}} operational <b>airfields</b> in Eastern England. I./NJG 2 aircraft could then scramble {{to be over}} the <b>airfields</b> at the predicted times of the bomber's return.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{damaging}} {{air attacks}} to their ships and landing forces, the Japanese proceeded {{with the construction}} of the naval seaplane base at Tulagi and Gavutu, receiving more shipments of troops and construction workers over the next several months. The base was soon operational with aircraft from the Yokohama Air Group which conducted air reconnaissance patrols throughout the surrounding area beginning on 6 May. On 27 May, the Japanese inspected the Lunga Point area on Guadalcanal as a possible location to build a large <b>airfield.</b> On 13 June, the Naval General Staff approved the construction of an <b>airfield</b> at that location and on 19 June, Admiral Inoue toured the site in anticipation of the <b>airfield</b> construction effort. The next day, Japanese troops began clearing the area of brush, and on 6 July, a 12-ship convoy delivered 2,000 Korean and Japanese construction workers plus 500 Japanese naval combat troops to conduct the <b>airfield</b> construction effort in earnest. The coastwatchers on Guadalcanal and Allied air reconnaissance observed the Japanese <b>airfield</b> construction efforts. Allied Catalinas and B-17s based at Port Moresby, Efate, Noumea, and Espiritu Santo frequently bombed the Japanese bases on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Gavutu over the next several months, but without causing significant damage. Several Japanese float fighters and one Allied bomber were destroyed in aerial combat during the missions.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{introduction}} of the Bombardier CRJ-200s, there were limited opportunities for route expansion from its home at Hiroshima-Nishi Airport. The airline decided to move to Nagoya <b>Airfield,</b> after the opening of Chūbu Centrair International Airport. On February 17, 2005, J-Air realized its dream and relocated to its new home at Nagoya <b>Airfield.</b> In order to strengthen the recognition of the JAL brand and improve customer convenience, the airline disposed its own flight numbers and changed to JAL flight numbers from April 1, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Eventually Kwajalein Island was selected, {{as it was}} 4,800miles from California, {{perfect for}} ICBMs, and already had a US Navy base with {{considerable}} housing stocks and an airstrip. The Zeus site, known as the Kwajalein Test Site, was officially established on 1 October 1960. As it grew in size, it {{eventually led to the}} entire island complex being handed over to the Army from the Navy on 1 July 1964. The site took up a considerable amount of the empty land to {{the north side of the}} <b>airfield.</b> The launchers were located on the far southwestern corner of the island, with the Target Tracking Radars, Missile Tracking Radars (MTRs) and various control sites and generators running along the northern side of the <b>airfield.</b> The ZAR transmitter and receiver were some distance away, off the northeastern edge of the <b>airfield.</b>|$|E
50|$|Different {{countries}} {{use different}} change criteria for their weather groups. In the United Kingdom, TAFs for military <b>airfields</b> use colour states {{as one of}} the change criteria. Civil <b>airfields</b> in the UK use slightly different criteria.|$|R
50|$|The {{destination}} {{list includes}} several <b>airfields</b> and cities throughout Kenya, including Nairobi, Lamu, Malindi, Mombasa, Ukunda and destinations {{in the interior}} of interest to tourists, such as several <b>airfields</b> within Maasai Mara and the Amboseli Airport.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{the entry}} of the US into the war a number of RAF Class A bases were {{transferred}} to the U.S. Eighth Air Force for use as heavy bomber bases with the RAF units formerly occupying them being re-allocated places at other RAF bomber <b>airfields,</b> and U.S. Army Engineer Units constructed more <b>airfields</b> to this standard or brought earlier <b>airfields</b> up to this specification by lengthening runways, etc. Many units of the U.S. Ninth Air Force also flew from Class A <b>airfields.</b> The term Class 'A' came about because, quite often, the resultant aerial shot of the crossed runways would look like the letter A.|$|R
