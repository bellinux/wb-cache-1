For the musical's soundtrack, she recorded six songs—"Another Day of Sun", [...] "City of Stars", [...] "Someone in the Crowd", [...] "A Lovely Night", [...] "Audition (The Fools Who Dream)" [...] and [...] "City of Stars (Humming)". La La Land {{served as the}} opening film at the 2016 Venice Film Festival; it received highly positive reviews, and Stone won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress. She also received an Academy, BAFTA, Golden Globe and a SAG award for Best Actress. Writing for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw reviewed, [...] "Stone has never been better: superbly smart, witty, vulnerable, her huge doe eyes radiating intelligence even, or especially, when they <b>are</b> <b>filling</b> with tears." [...] Besides being Stone's highest-rated film on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, La La Land was successful at the box office, earning over $440 million against its $30 million budget.|$|E

500|$|Nikki then runs {{onto the}} beach, before {{collapsing}} where Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) are playing ping pong. As Hurley and Sawyer rush to her, she says something barely audible. She is soon pronounced dead. Hurley and Sawyer try to recount what Nikki said {{before she died}} {{and come to the}} conclusion that she said, [...] "Paulo lies", although she actually said [...] "paralyzed". Sawyer and Hurley begin an investigation and find Paulo lying lifeless in the jungle. Sawyer finds a walkie talkie in Nikki and Paulo's tent, and concludes they were working with the Others, due to the similarity. Hurley does not think the Others are near their camp, but Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) reminds them that she was abducted nearby (unaware that it was Charlie who grabbed her). Sawyer tries to calm them down and says he will do a perimeter sweep. Meanwhile, Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan), who feels guilty, confesses to Sun that it was he who attempted to kidnap her. Sawyer returns, having found the diamonds, and the other survivors accuse him of being the killer because Desmond saw him arguing with Nikki just that morning. He gives the diamonds to Sun, but she later confronts him about kidnapping her and returns the diamonds because [...] "they're worthless here." [...] The survivors then hold a funeral for Nikki and Paulo, where Sawyer pours the pouch of diamonds into the grave. Nikki's eyelids open just as Hurley and Sawyer <b>are</b> <b>filling</b> the grave, burying her and Paulo alive.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the shell}} model, this {{phenomenon}} is explained by shell-filling. Successive atoms become smaller because they <b>are</b> <b>filling</b> orbits of the same size, until the orbit is full, {{at which point the}} next atom in the table has a loosely bound outer electron, causing it to expand. The first Bohr orbit is filled when it has two electrons, which explains why helium is inert. The second orbit allows eight electrons, and when it is full the atom is neon, again inert. The third orbital contains eight again, except that in the more correct Sommerfeld treatment (reproduced in modern quantum mechanics) there are extra [...] "d" [...] electrons. The third orbit may hold an extra 10 d electrons, but these positions are not filled until a few more orbitals from the next level are filled (filling the n=3 d orbitals produces the 10 transition elements). The irregular filling pattern is an effect of interactions between electrons, which are not taken into account in either the Bohr or Sommerfeld models and which are difficult to calculate even in the modern treatment.|$|E
2500|$|The Gajalakshmi {{panel is}} on the rear wall which {{represents}} Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity. The religious significance of Gajalakshmi is well brought out in the panel. She is shown with her hand holding lotus flowers, fawned by four attendants, and carved in [...] "perfect beauty and gracious countenance". Two royal elephants <b>are</b> <b>filling</b> the water vessels held by the attendants and one elephant is pouring water from the vessel on Lakshmi {{and the other is}} about to take the vessel from the maiden's hand to pour water over Lakshmi. The Durga panel, also on the rear wall, is indicative of victory over ignorance. The Trivikrama panel depicts Vishnu as the Lord of the three worlds. Another strikingly impressive panel is of Durga slaying the demon Mahishasura who is in an anthropomorphic form of a human with a buffalo head; the scene is reminiscent of a battle between good and evil forces, with the side of Durga represented by the confident looking ganas advancing and the other side of Mahishasura with his army of asuras (demons) retreating. This scene is a new architectural depiction which is appreciated as to [...] "enhance the drama and realism of the subject." [...] The Brahma panel is carved with Brahma having three heads in sambhaga or standing posture.|$|E
