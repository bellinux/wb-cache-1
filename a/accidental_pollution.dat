50|$|The most {{important}} river {{in terms of}} drinking water supply is the still relatively unpolluted Chaobai River in the East. It is impounded by the Miyun Dam. The Miyun Reservoir provides water to Beijing over a distance of 95 kilometer, initially through an open canal that brings the water to the Huairou Reservoir and then through a ductile iron pipe and three steel pipes to Beijing. The location of industries near the canal is prohibited to prevent <b>accidental</b> <b>pollution.</b> The Miyun Reservoir is the city’s largest single source of water. It also provides water for Beijing’s numerous lakes {{that used to be}} fed by springs that now have dried up. The dam used to also provide water for agriculture, but in 1981 the government decided that its water would only be used for domestic water supply. In 1986 the first plant in Beijing to treat surface water, the 9th water treatment plant, was established to treat water from the Miyun reservoir. As of 2009, it was Asia's largest water treatment plant with a capacity of 1.5 million cubic meters per day (0.55 billion cubic meters per year). While the plant was designed as a surface water treatment plant, when surface water is scarce groundwater is also treated in the same plant. Because of the higher salinity of groundwater and the hardness of surface water this leads to problems in the treatment process, causing limescale and the clogging of pipes.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the waters}} of Belgium only form a minor part of the North Sea, they contain some of the busiest {{shipping}} routes {{in the world with}} the Dover Strait and some of the biggest European ports in the immediate vicinity. It is therefore recognized as a key maritime risk area, also in terms of ship-source oil pollution. This chapter first discusses the significant, stepwise decrease of illegal oil discharges from ships in and around {{the waters of}} Belgium based on national aerial surveillance data since 1991 but also gives indications as to why the ecological quality objectives have not yet been met despite this decline. It further gives an overview of the <b>accidental</b> oil <b>pollution</b> incidents in this key risk area over the last 30 years and reflects on the high level of <b>accidental</b> marine <b>pollution</b> risk. Finally, the various measures are discussed that have been and will be undertaken in terms of oil pollution prevention, enforcement, preparedness and response with the aim to (further) reduce the oil pollution pressure in this environmentally sensitive area...|$|R
40|$|Detection {{of natural}} or {{accidental}} oil slick at sea surface is important both for exploration purposes and for environment protection. Radar imagery, either satellite or airborne {{is the prime}} tool to detect those slicks. Radar is widely used by the national agencies to monitor their maritime areas for <b>accidental</b> <b>pollutions</b> or boat discharges. Radar images can detect oil slick even {{in the presence of}} clouds. However the sea surface back scattered energy is rather insensitive to oil thickness. On the contrary several studies tend to prove that optical data may be used to estimate the oil thickness. These data may be in the form of hyperspectral data or thermal infrared data. The objective {{of this study is to}} show that SWIR satellite data which are more widely available than hyperspectral data, better resolved than thermal data and available at a very limited cost, can be used to detect and qualitatively assess the thickness of oil slicks.

In this study, the biomonitor equipped with a multi-parameter monitor was used to evaluate the effects of temperature, turbidity and pH on the behavior changes of Daphnia magna and Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). The results showed that both motility strength of Daphnia magna and Japanese medaka were inhibited in 5 h when the water temperature was lower than 5 °C. In 50 NTU water body, the decrease of motility strength to 70 % of Daphnia magna and Japanese medaka need 10 h and 24 h separately. In 100 NTU water body, the motility strength of Daphnia magna would decrease 3 h later, and it was about 6 h for Japanese medaka. If the pH value was lower than 5. 5 or higher than 9. 0, motility strength decreased significantly in 15 h.

40|$|Widespread {{all over}} the country till {{the end of the last}} century, the otter has rapidly declined. In 1973 when hunting was {{definitely}} closed, the otter was already threatened and restricted to a few localities. In 1889, the Belgian Ministry of agriculture decided to pay bounties for otters, a system which was cancelled only in 1963. Game statistics of the past century allow the annual otter bag to evaluated as roughly 25 % of the standing population. As it is the case in other European industrialised countries, freshwater habitat loss and water pollution lead to a considerable decrease of the river carrying capacity. Almost all the rivers flowing in the Northern part of Belgium are now lifeless or at least in a very bad condition. South of the river Meuse, some <b>accidental</b> <b>pollutions</b> are regularly reported (chloring in the river Ourthe in 1993; chloracetic acid in the Sûre in 1990 [...] .) and the level of organic pollution rises from year to year.

40|$|Previous studies {{suggested}} that the biological early warning system based on the behavioral responses of aquatic organisms could be efficiently used to illustrate the behavioral processes and to monitor toxic chemicals in the aquatic environment. However, the physiochemical factors of water quality, such as temperature, turbidity, pH and residual chlorine, may affect the behavioral response and then induce false monitoring results.

40|$|Besides <b>accidental</b> <b>pollution</b> {{caused by}} ships in distress, {{different}} types of routine ship operations lead to deliberate discharges {{of oil in the}} sea. Illicit discharges are the greatest source of marine pollution from ships, and the one which poses a long-term threat to the marine and coastal environment. Satellite monitoring, in particular using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations, may represent an effective tool for complementing traditional aerial surveillance. The capability of SAR in detecting oil slicks over the sea surface is well known and proven since a long time. A new automated methodology for oil spill detection was previously presented using ERS full resolution SAR data. In the present study a first attempt to examine the technique to ASAR ENVISAT medium resolution scenes was performed.

40|$|Success {{of crisis}} {{management}} largely depends on: (1) inherent resilience of the society; (2) preparedness {{level of the}} first responders; and (3) right "gut feeling" of crisis managers. "Learning by doing" to improve resilience and planning is difficult to do, especially for low-probability/high-impact events and for multi-hazards with cascading effects. Due to rarity of such events, many crisis managers, regional planers and other stakeholders have no first-hand experience in handling them. The best available alternative is learning by doing in a simulated crisis situation or during an exercise. The EU FP 7 project CRISMA (www. crismaproject. eu) - "Modelling crisis management for improved action and preparedness" has developed a methodology and software framework for simulation-based decision support systems. CRISMA targeted use cases in the preparatory phase of crisis management: short and long-term planning, desktop training and assessment in field trainings. Application prototypes cover different risk (floods, snowstorms, earthquakes, forest fires, <b>accidental</b> <b>pollutions,</b> mass accidents) and illustrate how the CRISMA framework {{can be used in}} a relatively simple but integrated manner to develop fully fledged decision support applications [Dihé et al., 2013].

40|$|Abstract. In {{building}} a new On-line Multi-factor Monitoring System (OMMS) of Water <b>Accidental</b> <b>Pollution</b> Events (WAPE) based on the behavioral responses (BR) of aquatic organisms, the effects of physi-chemical factors (PF) such as temperature (T), turbidity (TUB) and pH on BR of Daphnia magna and medaka (Oryzias latipes) were discussed with Biological Early Warning System (BEWS). The results suggested that when T was lower than 5 ℃, BR of D. magna and medaka would be inhibited in 5 hours. If TUB was more than 50 NTU, the behavior strength (BS) of D. magna would decrease to about 0. 3 after 10 h exposure, the effects on medaka would be much weaker in 24 h than D. magna. If pH is lower than 5. 5 or higher than 9, negative effects on BR of both aquatic organisms would happen in 15 h.

The simulation of the water quality of lower Dnieper and Dnieper-Boog Estuary shows that the distance of the intrusion of the salt wedge into lower Dnieper linearly depends from the discharges from Kakhovka HPP for the discharges in range 600 - 4000 m 3 s- 1...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} how {{the concerns of}} economic efficiency and of redistribution can {{be integrated into the}} design of the policies that aim to control the nitrogen flows. Generally speaking, the economists recommend to determine the degree of pollution and to arbitrate between the gains and the transaction costs associated to the implementation of the policy. Regarding instruments, the reduction of the diffuse nitrogen pollution needs a quantitative or economic instrument owing to the difficulty of valuing the environmental efforts of the producers on markets. Unlike for pesticides, the quota is here preferred to the tax, in particular in the case of fertilisers. The polluter-payer principle should be applied to the risks of <b>accidental</b> <b>pollution</b> on livestock farms.

Swimming changes in zebrafish were detected at a concentration as low as 1 % of the LC 50 - 24 h within five hours. Hyperactivity was the first response, followed by a second response of fish surfacing. The change patterns of swimming speed in zebrafish were similar in all exposure groups, but the degree increased with increasing concentrations. Swimming speed and depth were altered within the first two hours after exposure, which was regarded as the most vital phase for water quality monitoring. The duration of hyperactivity {{and the time of}} zebrafish surfacing were both logarithmically correlated with exposure concentrations, which was helpful to distinguish the level of pollution...|$|R
