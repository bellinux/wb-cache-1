5|$|The jackdaw was {{considered}} sacred in Welsh folklore as it nested in church steeples– it was shunned by the Devil {{because of its}} choice of residence. Nineteenth century belief in the Fens held that seeing a jackdaw {{on the way to}} a wedding was a good omen for <b>a</b> <b>bride.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to some sources, Serbian king Peter I wanted Tatiana as <b>a</b> <b>bride</b> for {{his younger}} son, Prince Alexander. In January 1914, the Serbian prime {{minister}} Nikola Pašić delivered {{a letter to}} Tsar Nicholas in which King Peter expressed a desire for his son to marry one of the Grand Duchesses. Nicholas replied that he would allow his daughters to decide whom to marry, but {{he noticed that the}} Serbian prince Alexander often gazed upon Tatiana during a family dinner. Marriage negotiations ended due to the outbreak of World War I. Tatiana exchanged letters with Alexander during World War I and Alexander was distraught when he learned of her death.|$|E
5|$|Female virtue {{was tied}} to {{literary}} knowledge in the 17th century, leading to a demand for Murasaki or Genji inspired artifacts, known as genji-e. Dowry sets decorated with scenes from Genji or illustrations of Murasaki became particularly popular for noblewomen: in the 17th century genji-e symbolically imbued <b>a</b> <b>bride</b> with an increased level of cultural status; by the 18th century {{they had come to}} symbolize marital success. In 1628, Tokugawa Iemitsu's daughter had a set of lacquer boxes made for her wedding; Prince Toshitada received a pair of silk genji-e screens, painted by Kanō Tan'yū as a wedding gift in 1649.|$|E

5|$|In Liao custom betrothal {{was seen}} as being equally serious to, if not more serious than, {{marriage}} itself, and was difficult to annul. The groom would pledge to work for three years for the bride's family, pay <b>a</b> <b>bride</b> price, and lavish the bride's family with gifts. After the three years, the groom {{would be allowed to}} take the bride back to his home, and the bride would usually cut off all ties with her family.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} English {{translation}} of 1847 by Mary Howitt, the tale {{opens with a}} beggar woman giving a peasant's wife a barleycorn in exchange for food. Once planted, a tiny girl, Thumbelina (Tommelise), emerges from its flower. One night, Thumbelina, asleep in her walnut-shell cradle, is carried off by a toad who wants her as <b>a</b> <b>bride</b> for her son. With the help of friendly fish and a butterfly, Thumbelina escapes the toad and her son, and drifts on a lily pad until captured by a stag beetle who later discards her when his friends reject her company.|$|E
5|$|Isabeau's uncle, Duke Frederick of Bavaria-Landshut, {{suggested}} in 1383 {{that she be}} considered as <b>a</b> <b>bride</b> to King Charles VI of France. The match was proposed again at the lavish Burgundian double wedding in Cambrai in April 1385—John the Fearless and his sister Margaret of Burgundy married Margaret and William of Bavaria-Straubing respectively. Charles, then 17, rode in the tourneys at the wedding. He was an attractive, physically fit young man, who enjoyed jousting and hunting and was excited to be married.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} source mentioning Stephen by name {{dates from}} 30 April 1455, when Pope Callixtus III put the King of Bosnia {{and his son}} under his protection. King Thomas's ambitions for Stephen grew as he strived to establish closer relations with the Western world. In 1456, he asked the Pope to procure <b>a</b> <b>bride</b> for his son, specifying {{that she should be}} a princess from a royal house. Negotiations soon commenced about Stephen's marriage to an illegitimate daughter of Francesco I Sforza, Duke of Milan, but Stephen's father harbored greater ambitions.|$|E

5|$|As a result, {{the gods}} and goddesses meet and hold a thing to discuss and debate the matter. At the thing, the god Heimdallr puts forth the {{suggestion}} that, in place of Freyja, Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women's clothing down to his knees, a bridal head-dress, and the necklace Brísingamen. Thor rejects the idea, yet Loki interjects {{that this will be}} the only way to get back Mjöllnir. Loki points out that, without Mjöllnir, the jötnar will be able to invade and settle in Asgard. The gods dress Thor as <b>a</b> <b>bride,</b> and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to Jötunheimr together.|$|E
5|$|Bramshill {{appears to}} have been a local {{sporting}} and social venue since the 16th century. The cricket ground at the house played host to a first-class match in 1823 when an early Hampshire team played an England XI, and it hosted three other matches in 1825–26. During the Second World War, the mansion was used as a Red Cross maternity home, before becoming the residence of the exiled King Michael and Queen Anne of Romania for a number of years. It became the location of the Police Staff College in 1960, and was later home to the European Police College. As a result, many campus buildings have been added to the estate. Owing to escalating maintenance costs the property was sold to the heritage property developers City & Country in August 2014. Among the 14 ghosts reputed to haunt the house is that of <b>a</b> <b>bride</b> who accidentally locked herself in a chest on her wedding night and was not found until 50 years later.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{looked to}} further Valois {{interests}} by grand dynastic marriages. In 1570, Charles IX married Elisabeth of Austria, daughter of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. Catherine was also {{eager for a}} match between one of her two youngest sons and Elizabeth I of England. After Catherine's daughter Elisabeth died in childbirth in 1568, she had touted her youngest daughter Margaret as <b>a</b> <b>bride</b> for Philip II of Spain. Now she sought a marriage between Margaret and Henry III of Navarre, Jeanne' son, {{with the aim of}} uniting Valois and Bourbon interests. Margaret, however, was secretly involved with Henry of Guise, the son of the late Duke of Guise. When Catherine found this out, she had her daughter brought from her bed. Catherine and the king then beat her, ripping her nightclothes and pulling out handfuls of her hair.|$|E

5|$|In 855, Michael III turned {{fifteen and}} thus came {{nominally}} of age. His mother and Theoktistos both underestimated the young emperor's desire to free himself from their custodianship, and antagonized him further when they arranged <b>a</b> <b>bride</b> show and selected Eudokia Dekapolitissa as his bride, disregarding Michael's attachment to his mistress, Eudokia Ingerina. Theodora's brother Bardas {{was able to}} use Michael's resentment for the high-handed manner in which he was treated and began to turn him against the regency. With Michael's backing, Bardas was allowed to return to the capital, and on 20 November 855, Theoktistos was murdered. Theodora was compelled to retire to a monastery a few months later, bringing the regency officially to an end.|$|E
5|$|Quintus of Smyrna, in {{a passage}} whose {{atmosphere}} Boitani describes as sad and elegiac, retains what for Boitani {{are the two}} important issues of the ancient story, that Troilus is doomed by Fate and that his failure to continue his line symbolises Troy's fall. In this case, {{there is no doubt}} that Troilus entered battle knowingly, for in the Posthomerica Troilus's armour is one of the funerary gifts after Achilles' own death. Quintus repeatedly emphasises Troilus's youth: he is beardless, virgin of <b>a</b> <b>bride,</b> childlike, beautiful, the most godlike of all Hecuba's children. Yet he was lured by Fate to war when he knew no fear and was struck down by Achilles' spear just as a flower or corn that has borne no seed is killed by the gardener.|$|E
5|$|The clip {{starts with}} <b>a</b> <b>bride</b> reaching, on a limousine, the chapel on which she's {{about to get}} married. As she is shown walking inside the chapel's doors, Arjona starts to sing while sit on the chairs in the empty chapel. Then, the bride is shown again {{alongside}} the groom in the altar, ready to make the vows, while the chapel {{is filled with the}} invitees. Then, scenes of Arjona playing the piano and singing, and scenes of the ceremony are interpolated, showing the behaviour of the invitees. Later, the invitees are shown involved in discussions and fights while Arjona keeps singing the chorus and verses of the song. As the fights between the invitees increase, the groom rejects the bride and she, stunned, escapes from the chapel. Then, it is shown that all was an illusion from the bride, and they are shown exiting the chapel, married. As of 11 July 2012, the video has reached 14 million views on YouTube.|$|E

When Katie asks Grace and Leo if they would like to get married, Leo says yes, but Grace believes he is being sarcastic, only later realizing that he is serious.

5|$|Charles and the Duke of Buckingham, James's {{favourite}} {{and a man}} who {{had great}} influence over the prince, travelled incognito to Spain in February 1623 to try to reach agreement on the long-pending Spanish match. In the end, however, the trip was an embarrassing failure. The Infanta thought Charles was little more than an infidel, and the Spanish at first demanded that he convert to Roman Catholicism as a condition of the match. The Spanish insisted on toleration of Catholics in England and the repeal of the penal laws, which Charles knew would never be agreed by Parliament, and that the Infanta remain in Spain for a year after any wedding to ensure that England complied with all the terms of the treaty. A personal quarrel erupted between Buckingham and the Count of Olivares, the Spanish chief minister, and so Charles conducted the ultimately futile negotiations personally. When Charles returned to London in October, without <b>a</b> <b>bride</b> and to a rapturous and relieved public welcome, he and Buckingham pushed a reluctant King James to declare war on Spain.|$|E

Callie refuses to marry Twayne, and to prove that her relationship with Mark is serious, she invites him to move in with her, but does not tell him about her arranged marriage to Twayne. Meanwhile, Mark is having troubles at the Department of Integration; he receives rather negative feedback on his teacher evaluation forms from his students. Since the department cannot afford having individual sessions with students, he decides to hold them at his and his zombie roommate Randall's apartment. At his first session, Mark is kidnapped by Aldermach who bribes him {{to break up}} with Callie. Mark declines, and Callie's human mother Rosie shows up and argues with Aldermach, which gives Mark the idea to invite them both to therapy sessions. Following the session, Mark leaves the room for a short while, and when he comes back, Aldermach and Rosie are having sex and eventually get back together.|$|E
