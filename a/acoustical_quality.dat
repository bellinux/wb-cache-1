40|$|From the {{acoustical}} {{point of}} view, spaces like open plan offices, restaurants or railway stations {{can be understood}} as multi-source environments. The <b>acoustical</b> <b>quality</b> depends on the situation. Sometimes, speech privacy is of interest, in other cases speech intelligibility is desired, but in any case too high sound levels should be avoided. Higher sound levels can be acceptable in a railway station or a students’ restaurant, but in an open plan office, the global masking noise is preferably lower than 48 dB(A). In many ray-tracing programs an auralization method is incorporated. In our research this method is used to demonstrate the <b>acoustical</b> <b>quality</b> in an office space to architects and future users. In the example of this paper a U-shaped open plan office is analyzed. Measured and simulated results are compared and the influence of several architectural set-ups is expressed in acoustical quantities and is made audible.

40|$|Teaching {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors affecting any education system. Many research efforts have been conducted to facilitate the presentation modes used by instructors in classrooms as well as provide means for students to review lectures through web browsers. Other studies have been made to provide acoustical design recommendations for classrooms like room size and reverberation times. However, using acoustical features of classrooms as a way to provide education systems with feedback about the learning process was not thoroughly investigated in any of these studies. We propose a system that extracts different sound features of students and instructors, and then uses machine learning techniques to evaluate the <b>acoustical</b> <b>quality</b> of any learning environment. We infer conclusions about the students' satisfaction with the quality of lectures. Using classifiers instead of surveys and other subjective ways of measures can facilitate and speed such experiments which enables us to perform them continuously.

The overall approach is integrated into a pitch synchronous overlap and add (PSOLA) analysis/synthesis framework.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of the European Noise Directive, traffic noise action plans have been established. One of those actions is to deepen the {{knowledge}} about low noise roads, as they are considered the most cost-efficient measure for traffic noise abatement. Therefore, ten test sections were installed in May 2012 in Belgium, with the objective of integrating Thin noise-reducing Asphalt Layers (TAL) in the Flemish road surface policy in a later stage. Eight test sections are paved with TAL with a thickness of a maximum of 30 mm and a maximum content of accessible voids of 18 %. The other two sections consist of a Double-layer Porous Asphalt Concrete (DPAC) and a Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA- 10 as a reference section). The <b>acoustical</b> <b>quality</b> of the asphalt surfaces has been monitored in time using Statistical Pass-By (SPB) and Close-ProXimity (CPX) measurements up to 34 months after construction. Texture measurements performed with a laser profilometer are linked to the noise measurement results. Very promising initial noise reductions were found, up to 6 dB(A), but higher than expected acoustic deterioration rates and the presence of raveling led to noise reductions of a max. of 1 dB(A) after almost three years. It is shown that the construction process itself has a large influence on the <b>acoustical</b> <b>quality</b> over time...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{reports the}} results of two studies of the {{acoustical}} environments in 'green ' office buildings before and after acoustical-control measures were installed. <b>Acoustical</b> <b>quality</b> was evaluated by occupant-satisfaction surveys and acoustical-parameter measurements. Occupants rated {{various aspects of the}} building and its built environment, including <b>acoustical</b> <b>quality.</b> The first study involved six 'green ' office buildings. The acoustical environments were rated as the worst aspect, and as poor, in all buildings. The results show that the various aspects of a building’s design are intimately interconnected; no aspect can be successfully designed in isolation. Buildings designed to obtain LEED ratings are unlikely to have satisfactory acoustical environments. In the second study, a naturally-ventilated, 'green', university building was studied before and after treatment. To promote natural ventilation, the floors are inter-connected by ventilation openings/shafts; the partitions separating the offices from the corridors have openings. Pre-treatment surveys rated the acoustical environment as its worst aspect, and as very poor. Occupants were particularly dissatisfied with speech privacy. Noise-control measures were designed, installed and tested. The ventilation shafts connecting the floor openings were lined acoustically and had acoustical baffles suspended in them. The results show that poor acoustical environments can be improved using engineering-control measures, but that these must be optimized...|$|E

Geometric room acoustic modelling methods were employed to realise this aim and particular attention was given to monitoring {{the influence of the}} level of geometrical detailing on acoustical characteristics. Three virtual acoustic models, of varying detail, were constructed and simulated in order to obtain room impulse responses which were then harnessed for analysis and the creation of auralizations. The results given in this document were obtained through direct examination of impulse responses gathered and subjective testing. Reverberation times were shown to be more or less consistent at high frequencies in all three models and increasingly dissimilar as frequency decreases.

Three simulations were performed and compared by using the Odeon software. First, the current acoustical situation in the church was simulated. Second acoustical model represents the solution related to the improvements of the speech intelligibility in the church by changes on the interior surfaces. The third model has to be understood as an academic example in which a 100 % of sound absorption was used for all walls behind the audience and for the ceiling to have an idea how the acoustical situation would be in an open air theatre with the ground floor shape similar to this church. Comparisons between these three different alternatives were done with a respect to Reverberation Time (T 30), Early Decay Time (EDT), Sound Pressure Level (Lp), Clarity (C 80) and Speech Intelligibility defined by STI values.

It provides an overview of existing scholarly writings on the pedagogical, physiological and <b>acoustical</b> <b>qualities</b> of the Lessac Approach. It reflects on current literature about the characteristics of good voice quality and especially the actor's formant. The empirical research on voice building in this study demonstrates that a randomised pre/post test/control group quasi-experimental design was used and is fourfold in dimension: it deals with a control group, a test group with 14 contact hours, a test group with 28 contact hours and a test group who had an extensive six-week workshop. Other variables that are reflected on are language, teacher and training methodology specificity. Investigative procedures include a questionnaire, various means of acoustic analysis and a perception panel. Where applicable, inferential statistics were done on the data.
