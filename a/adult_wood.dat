By overwintering in uplands adjacent to breeding pools, adults ensure a short migration to thawed pools in early spring. Wood frogs are mostly diurnal and are rarely seen at night, except maybe in breeding choruses. They are one of the first amphibians to emerge for breeding right when the snow melts, along with spring peepers.|$|E

50|$|The <b>adult</b> <b>wood</b> thrush is 18 to 21.5 cm long, with a {{wingspan}} of 30 to 40 cm and a {{body mass}} of 48 to 72 g. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 9.6 to 11.6 cm, the bill is 1.6 to 2 cm and the tarsus is 2.8 to 3.3 cm. It is distinctly larger than the Catharus thrushes with which the species is often sympatric but slightly smaller than the common American robin. The longest known lifespan for a wood thrush in the wild is 8 years, 11 months. The crown, nape, and upper back are cinnamon-brown, while the back wings, and tail are a slightly duller brown. The breast and belly are white with large dark brown spots on the breast, sides, and flanks. It has white eye rings and pink legs. Other brownish thrushes have finer spotting on the breast. The juvenile looks similar to adults, but has additional spots on the back, neck, and wing coverts. The male and female are similar in size and plumage.|$|E

5000|$|There {{were a few}} on the National Staff who {{strongly}} {{resisted the}} change to how leaders and youth were trained, including [...] "Green Bar Bill" [...] Hillcourt, who was loyal {{to the idea of}} teaching purely Scoutcraft skills and the Patrol Method at Wood Badge. While immensely respected for his many contributions to Scouting, Chief Scout Joseph Brunton overruled Hillcourt's objections and approved adapting the White Stag leadership competencies for nationwide use. Over the next several years, Larson repeatedly visited the Monterey Peninsula to observe and evaluate the White Stag program. He worked with Perin and Bánáthy to adapt the White Stag leadership competencies. Larson wrote the first syllabus for the <b>adult</b> <b>Wood</b> Badge program. Shifting from teaching primarily Scoutcraft skills to leadership competencies was a paradigm shift, changing the assumptions, concepts, practices, and values underlying how adults were trained in the skills of Scouting. The change paralleled a similar change in the point of view about how individuals learned leadership skills in society at large from that of trait theory based on inborn skills to transactional theory which stipulated that leadership skills could be acquired.|$|E
5000|$|L. sylvaticus {{primarily}} breeds in ephemeral pools {{rather than}} permanent water bodies such as ponds or lakes. This {{is believed to}} provide some protection of the adult frogs and their offspring (eggs and tadpoles) from predation by fish and other predators of permanent water bodies. <b>Adult</b> <b>wood</b> frogs emerge from hibernation in early spring and migrate to nearby pools. There, males chorus, emitting duck-like quacking sounds. A male approaches a female and clasps her behind her fore arms before hooking his thumbs together around her in a hold called “amplexus” which is continued until the female deposits the eggs. Females deposit eggs attached to submerged substrate, typically vegetation or downed branches. Most commonly, females deposit eggs adjacent to other egg masses, creating large aggregations of masses. Some advantage is conferred to pairs first to breed, as clutches closer {{to the center of}} the raft absorb heat and develop faster than those on the periphery, and have more protection from predators. If pools dry before tadpoles metamorphose into froglets, they die. [...] This constitutes the risk counterbalancing the antipredator protection of ephemeral pools. By breeding in early spring, however, wood frogs increase their offspring's chances of metamorphosing before pools dry. The larvae undergo two stages of development: fertilization to free-living tadpoles, and free-living tadpoles to juvenile frogs. During the first stage, the larvae are adapted for rapid development, and their growth depends on the temperature of the water and has a higher mortality rate. The second stage of development features rapid development and growth, and depends on environmental factors including food availability, temperature, and population density. Following metamorphosis, a small percentage (less than 20%) of juveniles will disperse, permanently leaving the vicinity of their natal pools. The majority of offspring are philopatric, returning to their natal pool to breed. Most frogs breed only once in their lives, although some will breed two or three times, generally with differences according to age. The success of the larvae and tadpoles is important in populations of wood frogs because they affect the gene flow and genetic variation of the following generations.|$|E

40|$|Dispersal is an {{important}} process determining species spread and survival in fragmented landscapes. However, information on the dispersal ability of woodland-associated invertebrate species is severely lacking. A study was conducted examining the ability of wood cricket (Nemobius sylvestris) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) to cross small watercourses and to orientate themselves towards habitat edges. A series of experiments were conducted where juvenile (i. e. nymph) and <b>adult</b> <b>wood</b> crickets were released and observed over time. The results of this investigation indicated that (i) nymphs and adults were equally able to swim across a small (≤ 35 cm) watercourse; and (ii) <b>adult</b> <b>wood</b> cricket were able to positively orientate themselves towards a mature woodland edge at a visual angle of ≥ 19 °, when less than 50 m away.

40|$|Information on the {{dispersal}} {{ability of}} invertebrate species associated with woodland habitats is severely lacking. Therefore, a {{study was conducted}} examining the movement patterns of wood cricket (Nemobius sylvestris) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) on the Isle of Wight, UK. Juvenile (i. e. nymphs) and <b>adult</b> <b>wood</b> crickets were released and observed over time within different ground surface substrates. Their movement paths were recorded and subsequently analysed using random walk models. Nymphs were found to move more slowly than adults did; and, when given a choice, both nymphs and adults showed a preference for moving through or over leaf litter compared to bare soil or grass. A correlated random walk (CRW) model accurately described the movement pattern of <b>adult</b> <b>wood</b> crickets through leaf litter, indicating a level of directional persistence in their movements.

40|$|Wood density plays {{a central}} role in the life-history {{variation}} of trees, and has important consequences for mechanical properties of wood, stem and branches, and tree architecture. ¿ Wood density, modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity, and safety factors for buckling and bending were determined for saplings of 30 Bolivian rain forest tree species, and related to two important life-history axes: juvenile light demand and maximum <b>adult</b> stature. ¿ <b>Wood</b> density was strongly positively related to wood strength and stiffness. Species safety factor for buckling was positively related to wood density and stiffness, but tree architecture (height : diameter ratio) was the strongest determinant of mechanical safety.
