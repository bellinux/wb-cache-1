25|$|Economist Paul Krugman {{argued the}} {{economic}} expansion during the Reagan administration was primarily {{the result of}} the business cycle and the monetary policy by Paul Volcker.

25|$|By {{his second}} year in office, Bush was told by his {{economic}} advisors to stop dealing with the economy, as they believed {{that he had done}} everything necessary to ensure his reelection. By 1992, interest and inflation rates were the lowest in years, but by midyear the unemployment rate reached 7.8%, the highest since 1984. In September 1992, the Census Bureau reported that 14.2% of all Americans lived in poverty. Bush lost reelection in 1992 in large part because the American people, concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> voted for change.|$|E
25|$|As {{the clear}} {{objective}} of the Spanish colonisers was {{to gain access to}} the rich mineral resources and the golden figures made by the Muisca, many primary accounts of the Muisca economy have been considered biased, misinterpreted or even outright false by later scholars.

Stone argued the season premiere should focus on the economy because it was the biggest news item at the time, but Parker felt they needed more time to craft the script, and that the Jonas Brothers would be a funny season opener. Stone ultimately agreed, and later admitted it was the right decision.

It was first broadcast on March 11, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central, and then aired two days later on satellite Paramount Comedy in the United Kingdom. It was the first episode of South Parks thirteenth season and the first episode to be broadcast in high-definition (HD). Parker and Stone argued over whether to start the season with a Jonas Brothers episode or a show about the economic recession, which they had been planning to do for some time. Stone argued they should focus on the economy because it was the biggest news item at the time, but Parker felt they needed more time to craft the script, and that the Jonas Brothers would be a funny season opener. Stone ultimately agreed, and later admitted it was the right decision. An episode <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> entitled [...] "Margaritaville" [...] was shown later in the season. By March 8, three days before the episode premiered, the script was only half-finished and the animation was not yet complete, in keeping with the practice of show creators Parker and Matt Stone to finish episodes upon last-minute deadlines; Stone said of the practice, [...] "We don't do a live show, but we kind of harness some of that energy. We kind of need that to work. We're, like, 'We have to do something right now. It's going on the air in just a few minutes.'" ...|$|E
