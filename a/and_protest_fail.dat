5000|$|At the 2005 G8 {{summit in}} Scotland, {{tactical}} frivolity was again used by protesters {{such as the}} Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army a group whose theatrical and carnival like performances succeeded in attracting considerable media attention and were funded by Arts Council England.The large scale use of tactical frivolity at the 2001 <b>and</b> 2005 G8 <b>protests</b> <b>failed</b> to deliver any tangible change in policy. But the method continued to be used, for example at protests held concerning air travel at Heathrow, England, during 2007.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2013, a New York Supreme Court judge {{threw out}} the lawsuit against FreshDirect's move, finding that the city's {{environmental}} review was [...] "based on a thorough review of all areas of relevant concern." [...] South Bronx Unite, joined by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Latino Pastoral Action Center, filed an appeal in late 2013, but their appeal was dismissed in March 2014. [...] South Bronx Unite also organized protests against the move, including a demonstration at the Harlem River Yards on March 22, 2014 {{which resulted in the}} arrests of nine protesters. [...] These legal challenges <b>and</b> <b>protests</b> ultimately <b>failed</b> to stop the move, with FreshDirect breaking ground for its new facility in December 2014.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2014, Crimean Tatar leader Mustafa Dzhemilev was {{prevented}} from entering Crimea, resulting in Crimean Tatars organizing large <b>protests</b> <b>and</b> a <b>failed</b> attempt to help Dzhemilev enter Crimea after Crimean Tatars broke through a border checkpoint. In response, Crimean authorities accused the Mejlis of extremist activity regarding [...] "illegal" [...] gatherings marked by [...] "violence and threats of violence", {{warning that the}} Mejlis could be dissolved and outlawed across Russia.|$|R
50|$|Three {{members of}} the {{commission}} met in 2015 with the commission’s president, Cardinal Sean O’Malley, to voice their objection to Francis’ appointment of Bishop Juan Barros to lead the diocese of Osorno in Chile. Barros {{has been accused of}} complicity in an abuse case there. Bishop Barros was a close associate of a Santiago priest the Vatican found guilty of sexual abuse in 2011, Rev. Fernando Karadima. Father Karadima’s victims claim Barros was aware of the abuse but did not <b>protest,</b> <b>and</b> subsequently <b>failed</b> to support the victims.|$|R
5000|$|Occidental {{met with}} {{substantial}} resistance from 1992 to 2001 when {{it tried to}} drill for oil in {{the territory of the}} U'wa people in northeast Colombia. The locals were concerned about environmental damage and feared that development would bring strangers and invite violence to the region. There also were tribal beliefs that oil is the [...] "blood of the earth" [...] and should not be removed. They believed that oil infrastructure would be a target for violent leftist guerillas in the country. After years of shareholder resolutions, legal battles, <b>protests,</b> <b>and</b> a <b>failed</b> test well, the company abandoned the project. Repsol YPF took over the project and continues to work on it.|$|R

5000|$|According to TIME magazine, [...] "as {{authorities}} {{attempted to}} settle him in one Bay Area town after another, angry crowds and Tampa's Chapter of Guardian Angels led <b>protests,</b> screamed, picketed <b>and</b> eventually prevailed." [...] In Rodeo, about 25 {{miles northeast of}} San Francisco, a crowd of approximately 500 local protestors were up in arms and forced officers to move him under armed guard from a hotel room. Authorities tried housing him {{across the street from}} Concord's City Hall, but that was met with <b>protests</b> <b>and</b> <b>failed</b> too. [...] He was removed from one apartment in Contra Costa County in a bullet-proof vest after 400 residents surrounded the building to protest a decision to place him there permanently. Governor George Deukmejian ordered that Singleton be placed in a trailer on the grounds of San Quentin for the duration of his one-year parole.|$|R

50|$|The {{new laws}} drew {{criticism}} from the public, with several demonstrators taking to the streets accusing the government of encroachments against their rights and privacy. Protestors again clashed with police, though the <b>protests</b> <b>failed</b> to materialise back to June 2013 levels.|$|R
500|$|The BNA {{downplayed the}} effect of the protests, saying it was [...] "business as usual" [...] in the country. [...] "Bahrainis and expatriates {{reported}} to work on Wednesday just like any other day, defying calls by radical opposition groups of road blockades and attack on properties," [...] the state-run agency added. Critics said the <b>protests</b> <b>failed</b> as most streets were empty <b>and</b> <b>protests</b> disorganized. Abdulla Al Junaid of the pro-government National Union Gathering said an opposition cleric criticized Tamarod as a [...] "stillborn". The United States expressed its concern at the possibility of violence. [...] "We remain very concerned about continuing incidents of violence in Bahrain and, of course, the possibility for violence and would urge all parties to strongly condemn violence and contribute to fostering a climate of dialogue and reconciliation," [...] said the spokesperson of State Department. The spokesperson added that they [...] "support the right of individuals to peacefully assemble and of course, the right of freedom of expression, including in Bahrain".|$|R
40|$|The three {{articles}} {{that make up}} this thesis consider the diverse forms of contentious politics and mass mobilization that emerged during the 25 th January Egyptian Revolution in 2011 and its aftermath. The first article, discussing the eighteen days of anti-Mubarak protest, pays {{special attention to the}} position of the Egyptian army in and around Midan al-Tahrir, and recounts how protestors sought to co-opt and neutralize the threat posed by regime forces. It finds that fraternizing protestors developed a repertoire of contention that made situational, emotional claims on the loyalty of regime troops. The second article explores the role of elections <b>and</b> <b>protests</b> during the <b>failed</b> democratic transition away from authoritarian rule that began on 11 February with Mubarak’s resignation and ended on 3 July 2013 with a military coup. Highlighting the Muslim Brothers’ demobilization and privileging of procedural democracy following Mubarak’s ousting, it offers an alternative account of where and when Egypt’s democratic project went wrong. The final article considers opposition to the 3 July coup and in particular the effects of state repression on the daily street protests launched by the Muslim Brothers and their allies in the post-coup period. Far from being defeated, anti-coup contention, it is suggested, has instead been contained in ways that have made <b>protest</b> less visible <b>and</b> less disruptive over time. Taken as a whole, the thesis suggests new ways to understand and explain the 25 th January Revolution, its trajectories and legacies...|$|R
50|$|The Presidential Commission {{report states}} that the autumn 1956 student {{movement}} was unique {{in its ability to}} organise a protest movement with a well-defined programme, with demands covering the entirety of Romanian society. The report concludes that the <b>protest</b> <b>failed</b> {{due to the lack of}} a single coordination centre, the lack of support from other societal groups, and the authorities' actions to stop any protest movement.|$|R
50|$|Plans to make {{a second}} attempt at loading the Caroline were delayed on 17 January when sailings at Brightlingsea were {{cancelled}} due to 70 mph winds off the south coast. BALE leafletted every household in the town asking people to attend the protest scheduled for 18 January. They also announced {{that they would be}} using boats to intercept the Caroline in the event that the main roadside <b>protest</b> <b>failed.</b>|$|R

50|$|In the 1960s {{freedom of}} {{expression}} diminished greatly in Iran. Sa'edi <b>and</b> other intellectuals <b>protested</b> the Ministry of Culture and Art policy of 1966 forcing all publishers to seek state permission to print literature. In 1968, after their <b>protests</b> <b>failed,</b> Sa'edi <b>and</b> other writers formed the Kanun-e Nevisandegan-e Iran ("Association of Iran Writers"). Although censorship {{of some of his}} works continued, Sa'edi continued to publish. In addition to dramas, stories, novels, and screenplays, Sa'edi participated in the publication of literary magazines, scientific journals and also published fifteen translations of European psychological and medical literature. In 1973, Amir Kabir Publishers made Sa'edi editor of Alefba, a quarterly literary magazine. However, in 1974 the Pahlavi government banned the journal and SAVAK, its secret police, arrested and tortured Sa'edi. Already having a history of suicidal thoughts, Sa'edi's depression loomed after his release from Tehran's infamous Evin Prison nearly a year later.|$|R
2500|$|By 1963, the South Australian {{group was}} finished, {{which led to}} a push from Sydney {{to take control of the}} state group's magazine. On 23 February 1967, UFOIC V/Pres Mr. Harry O’Brian [...] made an {{application}} for copyright on the state group's magazine Australian Flying Saucer Review. Victoria <b>and</b> Queensland <b>protested,</b> the application <b>failed,</b> <b>and</b> VFSRS closed the door on Sydney. UFOIC continued publishing a newsletter from 1964 until late 1979.|$|R
40|$|Ten years on, {{many people}} {{are still trying to}} {{understand}} the reasons for the terrible violence that sections of the Italian police force inflicted on those demonstrating against the G 8 summit in Genoa. Asking why is understandable but, to be frank, is not only naive but a cause for concern because it shows they do not realise the extent of the neoconservative experiment in the management of social <b>and</b> political <b>protest.</b> They <b>fail</b> to recognise that acts of brutality, torture and violations of fundamental rights by a sizeable portion of the police force have become commonplace over the last decade. This may be due to narcotisation, or the “short-term memory ” that the media produces. However, when recalling episodes of police violence, we should also remember other acts of violence carried out against working people. For example, the neighbourhoods afflicted with toxic waste dumps or the residents of Val Susa affected by large public works like the Gronda in Genoa, [2] who are anguished by the asbestos the building programme releases into their environment. Let us also recall the blows inflicted on the l’Aquila earthquake victims (who travelled to Rome to protest to the government about the tragedy to which they have been abandoned), or the Sardinian shepherds, the residents of Quirra, or the “No dal Molin ” and “No Ponte ” campaigners. [3] We should also remember the students, teachers and researchers who education minister Maria Stella Gelmini branded terrorists or quasi-terrorists because they dared to express hostility towards her “reforms. ” How many incidents of this kind have there been? They do not occur just in Italy- think of the police operations against social and environmental campaigns in Spain...|$|R

5000|$|As a {{traditional}} soldier, Blaskowitz kept a firm {{control on the}} men under his command in their dealings with civilians and was opposed to Army participation in war crimes by the SS and Einsatzgruppen. Between November 1939 and February 1940 he wrote several memoranda to higher military officials, in which he detailed SS atrocities in Poland, their negative effects on Wehrmacht soldiers and the insolent attitude of the SS toward the army. However, his <b>protests</b> <b>failed</b> to produce results, and merely earned him the enmity of Hitler, Hans Frank, Reinhard Heydrich and Heinrich Himmler, while Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl dismissed them as naive and [...] "uncalled for".|$|R
50|$|The village {{government}} has used eminent domain to obtain properties {{in an attempt}} to increase downtown revenue via new businesses. As of 2004 Lake Zurich had acquired all the property intended to fulfill its downtown redevelopment project. While many protests occurred regularly throughout 2005 near the promenade, the <b>protests</b> <b>failed</b> to garner much attention and ended up failing. A 2007 court defeat brought the issue back into the public eye, as a village-owned rental parcel was denied eminent domain. The renters were granted the ability to stay through the end of their lease due to clerical errors made by the village's legal and administrative employees regarding this parcel in particular.|$|R
