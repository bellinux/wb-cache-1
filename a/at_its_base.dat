5|$|Stela 74 is a {{fragment}} of Olmec-style sculpture that {{was found in the}} Middle Preclassic fill of Structure 7, where it was placed when that structure replaced the Pink Structure. It bears a foliated maize design topped with a U-symbol within a cartouche and has other, smaller, U-symbols <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>base.</b> It is very similar to a design found on Monument 25/26 from La Venta.|$|E
5|$|The {{blades of}} the new {{sporophyte}} grow from one or two initial blades by splitting. A tear forms {{in the middle of}} the blade <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>base,</b> which then continues along the entire length of the blade until it is split in two.|$|E

50|$|The Red {{machine was}} {{unreliable}} unless the contacts in its half-rotor switch were cleaned every day. It enciphered vowels (AEIOUY) and consonants separately, perhaps to reduce telegram costs, {{and this was}} a significant weak point.

5|$|The mandir also {{consists}} of 234 ornately carved pillars, nine domes, and 20,000 murtis of sadhus, devotees, and acharyas. The mandir also features the Gajendra Pith <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>base,</b> a plinth paying {{tribute to the}} elephant for its importance in Hindu culture and India's history. It contains 148 life sized elephants in total weighing a total of 3000tons.|$|E
5|$|Adams is {{the source}} of the {{headwaters}} for two major rivers, the Lewis River and White Salmon River. The many streams that emanate from the glaciers and from springs <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>base</b> flow into two more major river systems, the Cispus River and the Klickitat River. The streams on the north and west portions of Adams feed the Cispus River, which joins the Cowlitz River near Riffe Lake, and the Lewis River.|$|E
5|$|Businesses in Chinatown {{attempted}} to raise $200,000 {{to build an}} 11-story bell tower pagoda {{at the south end}} of the park. The tower was planned to be constructed of brick and stone with a hollow interior. While visitors would not have been able to climb the structure, they would have been able to walk through an entrance <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>base.</b> Chicago Sun-Times writer Lee Bey believed the bell tower to be the park's most important feature. Despite the Taiwanese government making an early commitment to help finance the tower, it was never constructed.|$|E
50|$|During the Iraq war, the {{coalition}} forces bombed MEK bases and forced them to surrender in May 2003.

5|$|However, {{the most}} serious {{deliberate}} damage happened during the night of 12/13 May 2014, when the tallest trunk was sawn off <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>base</b> with a chainsaw, by unknown perpetrators. Following the vandalism, the severed trunk was stored, and it was eventually decided to re-attach it with artificial supports, several steel straps connecting the trunk to the base; this work {{was carried out in}} early July 2015 at a cost of €35,000, shared by the Catalan government and the Barcelona provincial administration.|$|E
5|$|Level Mountain can be ecologically {{divided into}} three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a largely {{destroyed}} Abies lasiocarpa forest on its flanks and a Picea glauca forest <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>base.</b> An extensive wild animal community once thrived {{in the area of}} Level Mountain. This included a wide range of animal species with caribou being the most abundant. Humans had arrived at Level Mountain by the early 1900s, followed by geological studies of the massif in the 1920s. This remote area of Cassiar Land District has a relatively dry environment compared to the Coast Mountains in the west.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, Kippenberger was given command of the 20th Battalion.

5|$|Wyoming {{operated}} {{out of the}} Chesapeake Bay {{area for}} the next seven months, training engine-room personnel for the expanding American fleet. On 25 November, Battleship Division 9 (BatDiv 9), which at that time comprised Wyoming, , , and , departed the US, bound for Britain. BatDiv 9 was to reinforce the British Grand Fleet <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>base</b> in Scapa Flow. The American ships reached Scapa on 7 December, where they became the 6th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet. The American ships drilled with their British counterparts from December 1917 to February 1918.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the post-medieval period, the tower was {{deliberately}} damaged to put it beyond military use, a process called slighting. This probably occurred {{towards the end of the}} English Civil War, after the defeat of the Royalist forces in Kent at the Battle of Maidstone. The tower was then owned by Sir John Rayney of Wrotham Place, a Royalist, and would have been an effective lookout tower in any future conflict. There appears to have been an attempt to bring down the whole tower by damaging the stair turret <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>base,</b> possibly using gunpowder, which failed due to the spiral staircase's unusually strong design. After this the upper storey of the tower was carefully removed instead, leaving the building roofless.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the steep}} {{elevation}} increase around the pass, the vegetation graduates from sub-tropical forest <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>base,</b> to a temperate region, to a {{wet and dry}} alpine climate, and finally to cold tundra desert devoid of vegetation. Around Nathu La and the Tibetan side, the region has little vegetation besides scattered shrubs. Major species found in the region include dwarf rhododendrons (Rhododendron anthopogon, R. setosum) and junipers. The meadows include the genera Poa, Meconopsis, Pedicularis, Primula, and Aconitum. The region has a four-month growing season during which grasses, sedges, and medicinal herbs grow abundantly and support a host of insects, wild and domestic herbivores, larks, and finches. The nearby Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary has rare, endangered ground orchida and rhododendrons interspersed among tall junipers and silver firs.|$|E

5|$|In 1901, Jacint Verdaguer {{reported}} that a woodcutter had recently tried to cut {{down one of the}} trunks, causing it to lean out; damage from which the tree was unlikely to recover. It was also {{reported that}} around 1895, cuts had been made to tap the tree for resin, and a fire lit <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>base</b> to speed the process. This and other damage prompted the Catalanist Union to erect a high stone wall around the tree in 1907 to protect against further attacks, though it was suggested that the building work also contributed to the subsequent death of the tree. By 1915 the aforementioned wall had been demolished.|$|E
5|$|In Hawaiian mythology, {{the peaks}} of the island of Hawaii are sacred. An ancient law allowed only {{high-ranking}} aliʻi to visit its peak. Ancient Hawaiians living {{on the slopes of}} Mauna Kea relied on its extensive forests for food, and quarried the dense volcano-glacial basalts on its flanks for tool production. When Europeans arrived in the late 18th century, settlers introduced cattle, sheep and game animals, many of which became feral and began to damage the mountain's ecological balance. Mauna Kea can be ecologically divided into three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a Sophora chrysophylla–Myoporum sandwicense (or māmane–naio) forest on its flanks, and an Acacia koa–Metrosideros polymorpha (or koa–ōhia) forest, now mostly cleared by the former sugar industry, <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>base.</b> In recent years, concern over the vulnerability of the native species has led to court cases that have forced the Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources to eradicate all feral species on the mountain.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, Greek Orthodox churches {{beginning}} in the 1950s tended to use a large central dome with a ring of windows <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>base</b> evocative of the central dome of Hagia Sophia, rather than more recent or more historically common Byzantine types, such as the Greek-cross-octagon or five-domed quincunx plans. Examples include Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church, completed in 1961 but designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1957, Ascension Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Oakland (1960), and Annunciation Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Atlanta (1967). The use of a large central dome in American Greek Orthodox churches continued in the 1960s and 1970s before moving toward smaller Middle Byzantine domes, or versions of Early Christian basilicas.|$|E
