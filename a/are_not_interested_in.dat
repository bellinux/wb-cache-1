25|$|Traditionists who {{account for}} the {{majority}} of clerics keep themselves away from modernity and neither accept nor criticize it. Traditionalists believe in eternal wisdom and are critics of humanism and modernity. Traditionalists believe in a sort of religious pluralism which makes them different from Fundamentalists. Fundamentalists are also against modernity. Contrary to traditionists, fundamentalists openly criticize modernity. Moreover, fundamentalists believe that for reviving the religion in the modern era and for opposing modernity, they need to gain social and political power.

25|$|The {{first line}} {{treatment}} for social anxiety disorder is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with medications recommended only in those who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> therapy. CBT is effective in treating social phobia, whether delivered individually or in a group setting. The cognitive and behavioral components seek to change thought patterns and physical reactions to anxiety-inducing situations. The attention given to social anxiety disorder has significantly increased since 1999 with the approval and marketing of drugs for its treatment. Prescribed medications include several classes of antidepressants: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Other commonly used medications include beta blockers and benzodiazepines. It {{is the most common}} anxiety disorder with up to 10% of people being affected {{at some point in their}} life.|$|E

500|$|MOBA {{was founded}} in 1994, after antique dealer Scott Wilson showed a {{painting}} he had recovered from the trash to some friends, who suggested starting a collection. Within a year, receptions held in Wilson's friends' home were so well-attended that the collection needed its own viewing space. The museum then moved to {{the basement of a}} theater in Dedham. Explaining the reasoning behind the museum's establishment, co-founder Jerry Reilly said in 1995: [...] "While every city in the world has at least one museum dedicated to the best of art, MOBA is the only museum dedicated to collecting and exhibiting the worst." [...] To be included in MOBA's collection, works must be original and have serious intent, but they must also have significant flaws without being boring; curators <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> displaying deliberate kitsch.|$|E
500|$|Warhol clearly {{changed the}} concept of art appreciation. Instead of {{harmonious}} three-dimensional arrangements of objects, he chose mechanical derivatives of commercial illustration {{with an emphasis on}} the packaging. His variations of multiple soup cans, for example, made the process of repetition an appreciated technique: [...] "If you take a Campbell's Soup can and repeat it fifty times, you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the retinal image. According to Marcel Duchamp, what interests you is the concept that wants to put fifty Campbell's Soup cans on a canvas." [...] The regimented multiple can depictions almost become an abstraction whose details are less important than the panorama. In a sense, the representation was more important than that which was represented. Warhol's interest in machinelike creation during his early pop art days was misunderstood by those in the art world, whose value system was threatened by mechanization.|$|E

500|$|The Toronto Suns Steve Tilley, who {{believed}} that Remedy did a [...] "killer job" [...] on Max Payne 2, felt that the company kept what was great about the previous game, [...] "while everything else has been tweaked, overhauled and juiced up". He was {{a fan of the}} Bullet Time from the first game, and therefore appreciated seeing it return in the sequel, with [...] "even more impressive" [...] visuals. Tilley found that the game's [...] "lifelike physics engine" [...] was easily its best aspect, and noted that while playing the game, he threw a grenade across a room, which resulted in an explosion that sent enemies flying through the air in a realistic fashion. In addition, Tilley applauded Remedy for listening to fan complaints and resolving issues from the previous game, including improved dream sequences in Max Payne 2. He was, however, disappointed with the general linearity of the game, and noted that players who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> film noir themes will not enjoy them in Max Payne 2. Concluding, Tilley commented that the game [...] "has enough polish, cinematic flair and outright mayhem to thrill those who like their Sopranos with a dash of John Woo and a touch of Frank Miller." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{part of her}} {{argument}} that women should not be overly influenced by their feelings, Wollstonecraft emphasises {{that they should not}} be constrained by or made slaves to their bodies or their sexual feelings. This particular argument has led many modern feminists to suggest that Wollstonecraft intentionally avoids granting women any sexual desire. Cora Kaplan argues that the [...] "negative and prescriptive assault on female sexuality" [...] is a [...] "leitmotif" [...] of the Rights of Woman. For example, Wollstonecraft advises her readers to [...] "calmly let passion subside into friendship" [...] in the ideal companionate marriage (that is, in the ideal of a love-based marriage that was developing at the time). It would be better, she writes, when [...] "two virtuous young people marry [...] [...] [...] if some circumstances checked their passion". According to Wollstonecraft, [...] "love and friendship cannot subsist in the same bosom". As Mary Poovey explains, [...] "Wollstonecraft betrays her fear that female desire might in fact court man's lascivious and degrading attentions, that the subordinate position women have been given might even be deserved. Until women can transcend their fleshly desires and fleshly forms, they will be hostage to the body." [...] If women <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> sexuality, they cannot be dominated by men. Wollstonecraft worries that women are consumed with [...] "romantic wavering", that is, they are interested only in satisfying their lusts. Because the Rights of Woman eliminates sexuality from a woman's life, Kaplan contends, it [...] "expresses a violent antagonism to the sexual" [...] {{while at the same time}} [...] "exaggerat the importance of the sensual in the everyday life of women". Wollstonecraft was so determined to wipe sexuality from her picture of the ideal woman that she ended up foregrounding it by insisting upon its absence. But as Kaplan and others have remarked, Wollstonecraft may have been forced to make this sacrifice: [...] "it is important to remember that the notion of woman as politically enabled and independent [...] fatally linked [...] to the unrestrained and vicious exercise of her sexuality." ...|$|E
