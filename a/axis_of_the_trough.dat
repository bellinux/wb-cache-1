50|$|The {{direction}} of motion of the cross-beds can show ancient flow or wind directions (called paleocurrents). The foresets are deposited at the angle of repose (~34 degrees from the horizontal), so geologists are able to measure dip {{direction of}} the cross-bedded sediments and calculate the paleoflow direction. However, most cross-beds are not tabular, they are troughs. Since troughs can give a 180 degree variation of the dip of foresets, false paleocurrents can be taken by blindly measuring foresets. In this case, true paleocurrent direction {{is determined by the}} <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trough.</b> Paleocurrent direction is important in reconstructing past climate and drainage patterns: sand dunes preserve the prevalent wind directions, and current ripples show the direction rivers were moving.|$|E
50|$|Geosyncline is a {{geological}} concept {{which was}} developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries before the concept of plate tectonics was developed. A geosyncline was described as a subsiding linear trough that was caused by the accumulation of sedimentary rock strata deposited in a basin and subsequently compressed, deformed, and uplifted into a mountain range, with attendant volcanism and plutonism. The filling of a geosyncline with sediment is accompanied in the late stages of deposition by folding, crumpling, and faulting of the deposits. Intrusion of crystalline igneous rock and regional uplift along the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trough</b> generally complete the history of a particular geosyncline. It is then transformed into a belt of folded mountains. Thick volcanic sequences, together with greywackes (sandstones rich in rock fragments with a muddy matrix), cherts, and various sediments reflecting deepwater deposition or processes, were considered eugeosynclinal deposits of the outer deepwater segment of geosynclines.|$|E

In size and geometry, the Hurd Deep is a unique feature in the English Channel, terminating abruptly at its western end. It is incised into Jurassic and Late Cretaceous sediments.

Emphasis was put on closely-spaced heat flow measurements around knolls and small basins near the trough axis in order to clarify the nature of thermal anomalies, which {{were expected to be}} related to hydrothermal activity. In the axial graben of the southern Okinawa Trough, heat flow values obtained within 2 km of an axial volcano (the Yaeyama Central Knoll) were less than 50 mW/m 2 and showed large scatter. These low heat flow values can be explained as they are measured in the recharge area of the hydrothermal circulation, which is presumed to discharge at the Yaeyama Central Knoll. In the axial part of the middle Okinawa Trough, heat flow values measured in a basin to the east of the Natsushima- 84 Deep, which was known to have high heat flow, were 710 ± 690 mW/m 2. This indicates that the thermally active area extends along the central <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trough.</b> High and variable heat flow (360 ± 220 mW/m 2) was also found in a cauldron, about 35 km to the south of the axis of the middle Okinawa Trough.

40|$|The Jackfork (~roup in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas is an Upper Mississippian flysch {{succession}} that displays readily distinguishable lithofacies. The frontal Ouachitas {{contain a}} preponderance of disturbed beds which are interbedded with turbidite sandstones. These disturbed and disrupted beds developed {{at the foot of}} a northern unstable slope, the resultant bedding dependent upon the type of material involved, its state of consolidation, and the distance moved. Information gathered concerning the progressive changes from one type of sedimentary structure to another gives a qualitative measure of downslope distance. Muds which undergo submarine deformation upon a sloping sea floor first become flowage shales which change to blocky mudstones with continued failure. Failure of plastic muds and cohesive sandstone progressively form con-torted, chaotic, and. rubble bedding. Deformation of muds and sands form slurried bedding and breecias. Movement of flowing, creeping, or sliding clean sand may have occurred but is not considered to be a type of disruptive bedding. The deformation of mobilized, liquefied sand under some sediment cover produced load structures, audstone dikes, and intrastratal flow structure. The Ouaehita trough possibly consisted of an offsetting series of unstable shale slopes deepening southward to a gentle, west-dipping abyssal plain.

There are only two vein trends in the trough: the NW-SE trend, which tends to be orthogonal to the axis of the trough; and the N-S to NNE-SSW trend, which is younger than the former. Both vein sets are formed from ac tension joints reflecting different post-sedimentary deformation phases in the trough. The NW-SE veins are also more frequent than the N-S veins, almost in the ration of 2 : 1. Although 86 veins have been studied, not one was found oriented parallel to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trough,</b> a good indication of structural control on mineral vein orientations.

A 6 -km-thick highly reflective lower crust with velocities from 6. 4 to 7. 0 km s- 1 is seen beneath the Iberian margin. Along the Mallorca margin, the lower crust is variably reflective with a velocity of about 6. 6 km s- 1.

However, <b>the</b> estimates <b>of</b> different terms in <b>the</b> equation <b>of</b> motion for <b>the</b> near-Equatorial latitudes showed that, as in the middle latitudes, <b>the</b> inertia terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean motion are here one order of magnitude smaller than <b>the</b> terms <b>of</b> pressuro gradient. Having this in mind {{we believe that the}} only proposition which could be made concerns <b>the</b> important role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inertia associated with turbulent rather than average motion in <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Equatorial atmo-sphere. It is shown that tho inertia <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air stream near the Equator can account for <b>the</b> asymmetry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vorticity field around <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Equatorial <b>trough</b> (cyclonic relative vorticity north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trough</b> <b>axis</b> and <b>the</b> anticyclonic one south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> in Northern Hemisphere).

40|$|A {{refraction}} and wide-angle reflection seismic profile along <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Salton <b>Trough,</b> California and Mexico, {{was analyzed}} to constrain crustal and upper mantle seismic velocity structure during active continental rifting. From the northern Salton Sea {{to the southern}} Imperial Valley, the crust is 17 – 18 [*]km thick and approximately one-dimensional. The transition at depth from Colorado River sediment to underlying crystalline rock is gradual {{and is not a}} depositional surface. The crystalline rock from ~ 3 to ~ 8 [*]km depth is interpreted as sediment metamorphosed by high heat flow. Deeper felsic crystalline rock could be stretched preexisting crust or higher-grade metamorphosed sediment. The lower crust below ~ 12 [*]km depth is interpreted to be gabbro emplaced by rift-related magmatic intrusion by underplating. Low upper mantle velocity indicates high temperature and partial melting. Under the Coachella Valley, sediment thins to the north and the underlying crystalline rock is interpreted as granitic basement. Mafic rock does not exist at 12 – 18 [*]km depth as it does to the south, and a weak reflection suggests Moho at ~ 28 [*]km depth. Structure in adjacent Mexico has slower midcrustal velocity, and rocks with mantle velocity must be much deeper than in the Imperial Valley. Slower velocity and thicker crust in the Coachella and Mexicali valleys define the rift zone between them to be > 100 [*]km wide in <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> plate motion.

30|$|The 2004 off the Kii Peninsula {{earthquakes}} ruptured the subducting Philippine Sea plate near <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nankai <b>Trough.</b> A series <b>of</b> {{major events}} (<b>the</b> fore- and mainshocks with Mw> 7) showed very peculiar rupture characteristics. <b>The</b> depth extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foreshock is around 12 – 23 km below the sea surface; in contrast, that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mainshock is around 7 – 17 km, shallower {{and closer to}} <b>the</b> upper surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plate than the foreshock. <b>The</b> focal mechanism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foreshock is almost pure reverse faulting, with a P-axis directing roughly N-S, that is rotated clockwise by 20 – 25 ° from <b>the</b> <b>trough</b> normal. In contrast, the mainshock involved a significant component of strike-slip faulting, with a similar P-axis. The OBS survey revealed a double layer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aftershock activity and the upper NW trending layer contains aftershocks with strike-slip focal mechanisms. These features indicate that the compressional and tensional stress domains due to bending are significantly modified by tectonic stress disturbance and produced the fore- and mainshock ruptures deviated from simple reverse and normal faulting. I show that a supposed N-S compressional stress, which might be produced by <b>the</b> collision south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Izu Peninsula, can rotate the principal stress axes and change the stress type, which are consistent with <b>the</b> P-axes <b>of</b> these events and the strike-slip component for the mainshock. The complex rupture mode <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mainshock might have been produced by superposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> depth-dependent tensional bending stress in <b>the</b> upper half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lithosphere and the collisional stress. This collisional stress should be comparable to the bending stresses in magnitude, which is {{much larger than the}} stress perturbation caused by nearby interplate locking.|$|R
30|$|The Japanese {{islands are}} {{situated}} on the western Pacific convergent margin and were formed through subduction and accretion processes (e.g., Maruyama et al. 1997; Taira et al. 1989). The Shimanto Belt is an ancient accretionary complex formed during the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods and is now exposed in southwest Japan parallel to <b>the</b> trench <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nankai <b>Trough.</b> <b>The</b> Shimanto Belt is divided into a northern and southern section by a major boundary fault called the Aki Tectonic Line in the Shikoku and Kii regions and the Nobeoka Thrust in Kyushu (Imai et al. 1971). The Nobeoka Thrust is well exposed along the coastline in the Miyazaki Prefecture and is responsible for <b>the</b> exhumation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deeper Morotsuka and Kitagawa groups (hanging wall) in the north onto the shallower Hyuga group (footwall) in the south (Kondo et al. 2005; Okamoto et al. 2006, 2007; Raimbourg et al. 2009). Thermal structures along the Nobeoka Thrust studied by vitrinite reflectance, fluid inclusion, illite crystallinity, and fission-track analyses indicated that the maximum experienced temperatures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hanging wall and footwall are approximately 320 °C and 250 °C, respectively (Kondo et al. 2005; Hara and Kimura 2008; Raimbourg et al. 2009). This thermal gap across the fault suggests that the Nobeoka Thrust had been active as an out-of-sequence-thrust or megasplay fault at depths of several to 11  km beneath the sea bottom surface (Kondo et al. 2005). Assuming a geothermal gradient of 28 to 47 °C km− 1 and a fault dip angle of approximately 10 °, the thermal gap corresponds to 8.6 to 14.4  km displacement along the thrust in the seismogenic zone (Kondo et al. 2005). A large displacement of several kilometers along the splay fault at similar depths in <b>the</b> modern Nankai <b>Trough</b> is also suggested from <b>the</b> tilting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forearc basin sediments observed in seismic images (Park et al. 2002).|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} results of tectonophysical methods applied to reconstruct tectonic stress field <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north-western flank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean seismic focal {{zone in the}} region wherein the 2011 Tohoku earthquake was prepared. The reconstructions are based on earthquake foci data for the time period before the catastrophic seismic event. <b>The</b> field <b>of</b> stresses, wherein <b>the</b> Tohoku earthquake focus was formed, had a high gradient along <b>the</b> dip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seismic focal zone. It is revealed that the focus developed in <b>the</b> junction area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crust segments with high {{and low levels of}} effective pressure. A wide area of lower effective pressure was located at depths close to 30 km, and it was the most susceptible to brittle fracture. In our opinion, the area impacted by the Tohoku earthquake is large due to a large length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crustal segments with <b>the</b> high gradient <b>of</b> stresses, which are located along <b>the</b> eastern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Honshu Island. The stress reconstruction also shows that <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japan oceanic <b>trough</b> divides <b>the</b> seismic focal zone into areas of horizontal compression (westward) and horizontal extension (eastwards).

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Upper air {{soundings}} taken {{every three}} hours {{are used to}} examine a cold front of average intensity {{over a period of}} 24 hours. Vertical cross sections of potential temperature and wind and horizontal analyses are compared and adjusted until they are consistent with one another. These analyses are then used to study <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front. The front is found to consist of a complex system of fronts occurring at all levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troposphere. Low level fronts are strongest at the surface and rapidly weaken with height. Fronts in the middle and upper troposphere are much more intense. The warm air ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fronts is nearly barotropic while the cold air behind the fronts is baroclinic through deep layers. A deep mixed layer is observed to grow in this cold air. Examination of cross sections of potential temperature and potential vorticity indicates that the air in at least <b>the</b> upper portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper level fronts originates in the stratosphere. No evidence is found, however, of an extrusion of stratospheric air to very low levels. Diabatic processes seem to destroy the extrusion as it descends. <b>The</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper level fronts is complex. These fronts are observed to split apart, recombine, and descend to low elevations. This descent is due to the incorporation into <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> pre-existing stable/baroclinic layers. An equation for parcel-following frontogenesis in isentropic coordinates is developed and applied. No single process was found to be dominant in changing frontal intensity. Frontogenesis occurs on <b>the</b> leading edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fronts and frontolysis on the trailing edge. <b>The</b> magnitudes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> computed frontogenesis decrease downstream from <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper level <b>trough.</b> Isentropic trajectories are constructed in order to verify <b>the</b> computed values <b>of</b> parcel-following frontogenesis.
