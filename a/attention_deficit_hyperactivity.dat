5|$|<b>Attention</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>hyperactivity</b> {{disorder}} (ADHD) is {{a mental}} disorder of the neurodevelopmental type. It {{is characterized by}} problems paying attention, excessive activity, or difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person's age. The symptoms appear before a person is twelve years old, are present {{for more than six}} months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, or recreational activities). In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance. Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many children with ADHD have a good attention span for tasks they find interesting.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to assess symptoms of <b>attention</b> <b>deficit</b> and <b>hyperactivity</b> in children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis. Material and Method: Fifty-seven children (23 male, 34 female) with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and 57 healthy controls (25 male, 32 female) aged 6 to 12 years participated in the study. Conners’ Parent Rating Scale- 48 (CPRS), a 48 -item multiple-choice questionnaire, was completed by the mothers to identify the <b>attention</b> <b>deficit</b> and <b>hyperactivity</b> symptoms in children. Results: Mean age of the children with enuresis was 8. 54 ± 2. 18 years and that of the control group 9. 12 ± 2. 13 years. <b>Attention</b> <b>deficit</b> score in the enuretic group was significantly higher than that in the control group (p= 0. 02).

5|$|Externalizing {{disorders}} (i.e., acting-out disorders) show {{a clearer}} link to delayed gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, <b>attention</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>hyperactivity</b> disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior {{are associated with}} difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents, as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults. In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification {{were less likely to}} drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis. Interestingly, a 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ). This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification, and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{exposure}} in children is also correlated with neuropsychiatric {{disorders such as}} <b>attention</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>hyperactivity</b> disorder and anti-social behaviour. Elevated lead levels in children are correlated with higher scores on aggression and delinquency measures. A correlation has also been found between prenatal and early childhood lead exposure and violent crime in adulthood. Countries with the highest air lead levels have also {{been found to have}} the highest murder rates, after adjusting for confounding factors. A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that lead exposure explains 65% to 90% of the variation in violent crime rates in the US. A 2007 paper by the same author claims to show a strong association between preschool blood lead and subsequent crime rate trends over several decades across nine countries. Lead {{exposure in}} childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys. It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} plays a {{significant}} role in mediating executive functions. Neuroimaging during neuropsychological tests of executive function, such as the stroop test and working memory tests, have found that cortical maturation of the prefrontal cortex correlates with executive function in children. Planning involves activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, angular prefrontal cortex, right prefrontal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. Working memory manipulation involves the DLPFC, inferior frontal gyrus, and areas of the parietal cortex. Inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus.In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in <b>attention</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>hyperactivity</b> disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared with healthy individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression).... Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus (part of the striatum) in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior.... Early results with structural MRI show thinning of the cerebral cortex in ADHD subjects compared with age-matched controls in prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, areas involved in working memory and attention.}} Task shifting doesn't involve specific regions of the brain, but instead involves multiple regions of the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe.|$|E

40|$|Background : <b>Attention</b> <b>deficit</b> / <b>hyperactivity</b> disorder, is {{a common}} {{psychological}} disorder in persons, that continues from childhood into adulthood and leads to problem in various aspects of  their  life, such as personal, social, professional, and executive function such as working memory. Several studies indicate a close relationship between working memory <b>deficits</b> and <b>attention</b> <b>deficit</b> / <b>hyperactivity</b> disorder. Given the lack of studies {{on the effectiveness of}} neurofeedback in improving working memory in adults with ADHD, {{this study was designed to}} evaluate the effectiveness of neurofeedback in working memory. Materials and Methods: Research design was experimental with pre-test and post-test and control group and carried out on adults with <b>attention</b> <b>deficit</b> / <b>hyperactivity</b> disorder referred to the Atieh clinic in Tehran. After reviewing inclusion and exclusion criteria, 16 persons based on purposive sampling were selected in 2 groups of 8 cases as experimental and control groups. The research instruments were the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Inventory adult attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder of Barkley, vital cns test, auditory and visual integrated test signs. Data analysis, through SPSS software using U Mann-Whitney, was performed. The independent t-test, Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used also for complementary results.

40|$|The {{basis of}} this article is A. R.

Our objective here is to propose such qualitative criteria for neuropsychological analysis of children with diagnoses of <b>attention</b> <b>deficit</b> disorder with <b>hyperactivity</b> at preschool age. We follow clinical methodology that is traditional for historical and cultural neuropsychology and is an alternative for the psychometrical and cognitive approach.

The study analyzes mistakes and typical examples of execution of the tasks of neuropsychological qualitative assessment by regular children and by children with <b>attention</b> <b>deficit</b> disorder with <b>hyperactivity.</b> The results showed differences between these groups of children. The children with <b>attention</b> <b>deficit</b> disorder with <b>hyperactivity</b> made a lot of mistakes during assessments. Their difficulties are related to unfavorable conditions in the three functional brain blocks according to Luria’s conception. We conclude that “attention” cannot be considered the only or the main problem in children who receive this diagnosis by psychiatrists and neurologists. ...|$|R
