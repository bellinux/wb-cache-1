25|$|By 1086, Alan IV {{was forced}} to abandon his duchy after an {{invasion}} launched by William I of England. However, a peace settlement was reached that same year and in the negotiations that followed Alan IV was forced into marriage with King William I's second daughter Constance of England. The marriage ceremonies may {{have taken place in}} Bayeux in Normandy. William of Malmesbury wrote that Constance was unpopular at the Breton court because of her 'sever and conservative' manner. William of Malmesbury also alleged that Alan IV had Constance poisoned to death, but this remained unverified However, Orderic Vitalis wrote that as duchess, Constance did <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> to further the welfare of the Bretons, who grieved deeply at her death in 1090.|$|E

500|$|Barlow {{decided to}} leave Hollyoaks in early 2011, as {{she felt she had}} given <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> to the role. This {{prompted}} the producers to devise a memorable exit storyline for Rae. Barlow was informed of their plans in March 2011, but her exit, and details of the storyline, were concealed from viewers. Speculation arose that Rae would become the next victim of serial killer Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle); Barlow tried to discredit these rumours, and denied that she was leaving Hollyoaks as she wanted viewers to be [...] "surprised and shocked" [...] by her exit.|$|E
500|$|Daniels {{had said}} that he was {{attracted}} to the initial novel based on how [...] "raw and honest" [...] it felt. In an interview with AMC he noted that reading the book brought back a memory from his childhood of a young abused girl who knocked on his family's door, claiming that her mom was going to kill her. Daniels recalls that the incident {{was the first time he}} saw his mother frightened, specifically noting the helplessness of the situation, and stating [...] "she knew that she’d have to send this little girl home, and that was what disturbed her— that she couldn’t save her. She tried to make it easier for her. That’s <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do." [...] In creating the movie Daniels hoped that the experience would be cathartic and that [...] "maybe I could heal. And maybe I could heal other people, too." [...] Another stated goal Daniels had was to challenge the general public's perception of incest.|$|E
500|$|Minaj's [...] "Monster" [...] verse {{was listed}} by Complex {{as the best}} rap verse of the 2010s. West claimed {{at one point he}} {{considered}} deleting her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work:It was like that moment when I thought about taking Nicki's verse off of [...] "Monster" [...] because I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time. And I would do all that work, eight months of work on [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and people to this day would say to me 'My favorite thing was Nicki Minaj's verse.' So if I let my ego get the best of me instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform to be <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment… ...|$|E

2500|$|Inspired by this success, Douglas {{then set}} about collecting, [...] "re-building" [...] and [...] "re-constructing" [...] <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> of Manx folk dance. Again in {{collaboration}} with Arnold Foster, Douglas published two volumes of Manx dances, in 1936 and 1953. The twelve [...] "virile and characteristic dances" [...] collected in these volumes, the thirteen new dances that would appear in 1983 in Rinkaghyn Vannin and the incomplete notes on some others amounted to 29 dances in total. These Douglas {{considered to be the}} sum total of [...] "all the surviving Manx traditional dances." ...|$|E
2500|$|Norton {{retired in}} 1957. [...] After {{retirement}} she {{made every effort}} to limit her influence and weight in the workings of the Illinois State Archives. [...] She felt that she had contributed <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> and that it was time that the new leaders take over. [...] She also mentioned that she much preferred to walk by the lake and watch the bunnies. [...] When she {{died at the age of}} 92 she left all of her personal holdings to the SAA. [...] Upon the SAA's examination of her house they discovered a framed picture of the Illinois State Archives Building on her bedside nightstand.|$|E

2500|$|Kennedy's {{superior}} {{officer at}} the time, Captain Seymour A.D. Hunter, {{was quoted as saying}} that the U.S. Navy looked at Arvad as similar to Mata Hari. They thought she was using Kennedy to find out <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{about what was going on}} in the Navy Department. Captain Howard Klingman, then assistant director of the Office of Naval Intelligence, called Hunter into his office. Hunter was told that Kennedy needed to be put out of the Navy. Hunter pointed out that the situation was delicate because of Joseph P. Kennedy's having been United States Ambassador to England. However, he believed the young naval intelligence officer was not privy to information that would be [...] "more than a bit embarrassing". Hunter advised that Kennedy be transferred to a seagoing unit.|$|E
2500|$|Charlotte Rae {{initially}} reduced {{her role}} in seasons six and seven, and later {{decided to leave the}} series altogether, believing she had done <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do with her character and desired to move on to other projects. In season eight's heavily promoted one-hour premiere, [...] "Out of Peekskill" [...] Mrs. Garrett married the man of her dreams and joined him in Africa while he worked for the Peace Corps. Mrs. Garrett convinces her sister, Beverly Ann Stickle (Cloris Leachman), to take over the shop and look after the girls.

Describing the new changes to The Facts of Life Brandon Tartikoff, NBC Entertainment President, said he [...] "was surprised that The Facts of Life performed well this season, as, with a major cast change and all, I thought it might not perform as it had in the past. Facts has been renewed for next season." ...|$|E
2500|$|By her own admission, {{she was not}} {{a success}} at first. [...] She only made about $25 during her first month, and <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> afford for her office was two chairs and a {{borrowed}} typewriter. [...] As she told a reporter in a 1934 interview, [...] "I had no clients. And I had no money. [...] But I had great hopes." [...] However, in order to become successful, what she needed was some experience, so she did volunteer work with the local Legal Aid Society, where she not only got that experience but got involved with an important case about suffrage. [...] As a child, her mother had taken her to see famous suffragists Susan B. Anthony and Anna Howard Shaw giving talks about women's rights. [...] And the belief that women should be treated as equals under the law undoubtedly resonated with her even more {{as a result of her}} struggles to be taken seriously as an attorney. [...] She became even more interested in politics, and more committed to the cause of women's suffrage. [...] She was active in the Women's Suffrage Party and began challenging local laws that limited women's participation in the political process. And she argued one particular case that went all the way to the Ohio Supreme Court: thanks to her efforts, she won the women of East Cleveland the right to vote in municipal elections. [...] During this time, she also became involved in another cause, one that would be important to her all of her life: [...] disarmament and the quest for world peace. [...] For Allen, this was personal: [...] both of her brothers died while serving their country during the First World War.|$|E

60|$|Mary had no {{arguments}} which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> bring {{from her}} heart to offer in opposition to <b>all</b> this. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> only leave her hand in his, and feel that she was happier than she had been {{at any time since}} the day of that donkey-ride at Boxall Hill.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Falconer paused suddenly. She {{was a very}} truthful {{woman and}} she {{instantly}} realized that that last sentence was not true. She was not doing <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> for Camilla--she would not be glad, she feared, to do <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b>|$|E

Her gait was constrained, from the {{knowledge}} that his eyes were upon her until she had passed the hollow by the waterfall, and by ascending the rise had become hidden from his view by the boughs of the overhanging trees.|$|E
