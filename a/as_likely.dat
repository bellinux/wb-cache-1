5|$|A 1994 {{community-based}} {{study indicated}} that two out of every 100,000 people suffered from SCSFLS, while a 2004 emergency room-based study indicated five per 100,000. SCSFLS generally affects the young and middle aged; the average age for onset is 42.3 years, but onset can range from ages 22 to 61. In an 11-year study women {{were found to be}} twice <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to be affected as men.|$|E
5|$|According to an {{academic}} study, people {{perceived to be}} Middle Eastern were <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to be victims of hate crimes as followers of Islam during this time. The study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against {{people who may have}} been perceived as Muslims, Arabs, and others thought to be of Middle Eastern origin. A report by the South Asian American advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together, documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent between September 11 and 17. Various crimes such as vandalism, arson, assault, shootings, harassment, and threats in numerous places were documented.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago, Rashid Johnson exhibited The Evolution of the Negro Political Costume in December 2004. He presented replicas of three outfits worn by African-American politicians. He included a late 1960s dashiki worn by Jesse Jackson, a 1980s running suit worn by Al Sharpton in the '80s and a business suit worn by then United States Senator-elect Barack Obama. The presentation, which invited inspection, was <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to evoke humorous response to the Jackson dashika as well as critical commentary about the presentation of political attire.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, {{technology}} {{began to}} change this balance. New Krupp steel armour meant that it was now possible to give a cruiser side armour which would protect it against the quick-firing guns of enemy battleships and cruisers alike. In 1896–97 France and Russia, who were regarded <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> allies {{in the event of}} war, started to build large, fast armoured cruisers taking advantage of this. In the event of a war between Britain and France or Russia, or both, these cruisers threatened to cause serious difficulties for the British Empire's worldwide trade.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, gout {{is twice}} <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> in males of African descent {{than those of}} European descent. Rates are high among Pacific Islanders and the Māori, but the disease is rare in {{aboriginal}} Australians, despite a higher mean uric acid serum concentration in the latter group. It has become common in China, Polynesia and urban sub-Saharan Africa. Some studies found that attacks of gout occur more frequently in the spring. This {{has been attributed to}} seasonal changes in diet, alcohol consumption, physical activity and temperature.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} {{and even as}} late as 1987, Solidarity was seen by many, {{including}} most of its activists, <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> {{a thing of the}} past. It persisted solely as a rather small underground organization, supported by various international institutions, from the Catholic Church to the Central Intelligence Agency. When most senior Solidarity figures were interned or otherwise neutralized by the authorities, Zbigniew Bujak, head of the Union's Warsaw branch, remained in hiding and was the leader of the clandestine organization until his arrest in 1986. But the post-martial law general public showed signs of tiredness and disappointment, as it had become apparent that Solidarity was not a united front.|$|E
5|$|Keynes was {{ultimately}} a successful investor, {{building up a}} private fortune. His assets were nearly wiped out following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, {{which he did not}} foresee, but he soon recouped. At Keynes's death, in 1946, his net worth stood just short of £500,000 – equivalent to about £11 million ($16.5 million) in 2009. The sum had been amassed despite lavish support for various good causes and his personal ethic which made him reluctant to sell on a falling market, in cases where he saw such behaviour <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to deepen a slump.|$|E

5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} as a sizar to Trinity College, Cambridge University on 22 November 1780 {{at the age}} of 19. Trinity was at the time the richest college at Cambridge. Sizars were students who were not of the gentlemanly class, who were charged lower fees and obtained free food and/or lodging and other assistance during their period of study in exchange for performing work at their colleges. By the eighteenth century, sizars were fully integrated members of the community, who were <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to be employed by Fellow commoners as companions rather than servants. They were expected to wait at table (as were pensioners and scholars), but by the eighteenth century they had their own gyps (servants) and bedmakers.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August AD 14, Augustus {{died while}} visiting Nola {{where his father}} had died. Both Tacitus and Cassius Dio wrote that Livia was rumored to have brought about Augustus' death by {{poisoning}} fresh figs. This element features in many modern works of historical fiction pertaining to Augustus' life, but some historians view it <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> {{to have been a}} salacious fabrication made by those who had favoured Postumus as heir, or other of Tiberius' political enemies. Livia had long been the target of similar rumors of poisoning on the behalf of her son, most or all of which are unlikely to have been true.|$|E
5|$|On December 22, 2010, {{cabinet ministers}} Jerome Kennedy and Darin King, who were both seen <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> {{leadership}} candidates, announced {{they would not}} seek {{the leadership of the}} party. Both men said they were encouraging Dunderdale to run and that they would endorse her campaign if she entered the race. On December 23, 2010, Dunderdale garnered support from two other cabinet ministers when Finance Minister Tom Marshall and Municipal Affairs Minister Kevin O'Brien opted out of running for the leadership and threw their support behind her entering the race.|$|E

Multiple draft outlets ranked Harris <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to be drafted in the 2nd round or go undrafted. Two days after the announcement, Harris was recognized as an Academic All-Conference performer again. Harris suffered a hamstring injury shortly before the draft, which hampered his draft workouts and draft potential. Harris was undrafted in the 2010 NBA draft.|$|E
5|$|Plantinga's {{version of}} the defence embraces Augustine's view of free will, but not his natural theology. Rather than attempt to show the {{existence}} of God <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> {{in the face of}} evil, as a theodicy does, Plantinga's free will defence attempts to show that belief in God is still logically possible, despite the existence of evil. Theologian Alister McGrath has noted that, because Plantinga only argued that the coexistence of God and evil are logically possible, he did not present a theodicy, but a defence. Plantinga did not attempt to demonstrate that his proposition is true or plausible, just that it is logically possible.|$|E
5|$|SCSFLS afflicts 5 out {{of every}} 100,000 people. On average, the {{condition}} is developed {{at the age of}} 42, and women are twice <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> as men to develop the condition. Some people with SCSFLS chronically leak cerebrospinal fluid despite repeated attempts at patching, leading to long-term disability due to pain. SCSFLS was first described by German neurologist Georg Schaltenbrand in 1938 and by American physician Henry Woltman of the Mayo Clinic in the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|H3N8 {{has been}} {{identified}} as the probable cause of the 1889-1890 flu pandemic in humans, and also another epidemic in 1898 - 1900. Before the identification of H3N8 <b>as</b> the <b>likely</b> cause of the 1889 pandemic, the H2N2 subtype was most commonly suggested <b>as</b> the <b>likely</b> cause. At this point, {{it is not possible to}} identify the viral subtype for either the 1889 or 1900 outbreak with certainty.|$|R
2500|$|The {{main reasons}} states impose visa {{restrictions}} on foreign nationals are to curb illegal immigration, security concerns, and reciprocity for visa restrictions imposed {{on their own}} nationals. Typically, nations impose visa restrictions on citizens of poorer countries, along with politically unstable and undemocratic ones, <b>as</b> it is <b>likelier</b> that people from these countries will seek to illegally immigrate. Visa restrictions may also be imposed when nationals of another country are perceived <b>as</b> <b>likelier</b> to be terrorists or criminals, or by autocratic regimes that perceive foreign influence {{to be a threat}} to their rule.

50|$|In December 2006, Nonu {{expressed}} a desire to switch codes to rugby league and play in the National Rugby League (NRL) after the 2007 Rugby World Cup.

5|$|The West German {{authorities}} {{were aware of}} the high profile of the prisoners {{and the fact that the}} group had numerous sympathisers, so that terrorist acts aiming at the liberation of the Munich attackers were feared. Aircraft of (then) national airline Lufthansa or its Israeli counterpart El Al were identified <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> targets. On 9 September, an anonymous letter was received claiming that such a hijacking was indeed imminent, which prompted the Federal Ministry of the Interior (then led by Hans-Dietrich Genscher) to consider whether citizens of Arab states should be denied boarding of Lufthansa flights.|$|E
5|$|The {{deaths of}} {{brothers}} Christopher Arepa and Cru Omeka Kahui (20 March 2006 – 18 June 2006), two New Zealand infants from a Māori family {{who died in}} Auckland's Starship Children's Hospital after being admitted with serious head injuries, highlighted the fact that Māori children are more than twice <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to die {{as a result of}} abuse than non-Māori and that New Zealand ranks fifth highest among OECD nations for child deaths due to maltreatment according to a 2003 UNICEF report.|$|E
5|$|The {{probability}} {{of the creation}} of strangelets decreases at higher energies. As the LHC operates at higher energies than the RHIC or the heavy ion programs of the 1980s and 1990s, the LHC is less likely to produce strangelets than its predecessors. Furthermore, models indicate that strangelets are only stable or long-lived at low temperatures. Strangelets are bound at low energies (in the range of 1–10MeV), while the collisions in the LHC release energies in the range of 7–14TeV. Thermodynamics very strongly disfavors the formation of a cold condensate that is an order of magnitude cooler than the surrounding medium. As an example, it is about <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> as producing an icecube in a furnace.|$|E
