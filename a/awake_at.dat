5|$|The mildest form of hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{is difficult to}} detect clinically, but may be demonstrated on neuropsychological testing. It is experienced as forgetfulness, mild confusion, and irritability. The first stage of {{hepatic encephalopathy}} is characterised by an inverted sleep-wake pattern (sleeping by day, being <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> night). The second stage is marked by lethargy and personality changes. The third stage is marked by worsened confusion. The fourth stage {{is marked by a}} progression to coma.|$|E
5|$|Oan, {{angered by}} the BBC's {{incorrect}} reporting of his demands the previous evening, contacted the police negotiators shortly after 06:00 and accused the authorities of deceiving him. He demanded to speak with an Arab ambassador, but the negotiator on duty claimed that talks were still being arranged by the Foreign Office. Recognising the delaying tactic, Oan told the negotiator that the British hostages {{would be the last}} to be released because of the British authorities' deceit. He added that a hostage would be killed unless Tony Crabb was brought back to the embassy. Crabb did not arrive at the embassy until 15:30, nearly ten hours after Oan demanded his presence, to the frustration of both Oan and Sim Harris. Oan then relayed another statement to Crabb via Mustapha Karkouti, a journalist also being held hostage in the embassy. The police guaranteed that the statement would be broadcast on the BBC's next news bulletin, in exchange for the release of two hostages. The hostages decided amongst themselves that the two to be released would be Hiyech Kanji and Ali-Guil Ghanzafar; the latter was apparently released {{for no other reason than}} his loud snoring, which kept the other hostages <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> night.|$|E

25|$|In January 1987, MacKenzie {{published}} a totally unfounded front-page story alleging that pop singer Elton John had {{had sex with}} underage rentboys. Shortly afterwards, MacKenzie published further entirely false allegations that the singer had had the voiceboxes of his guard dogs removed because their barking kept him <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> night. MacKenzie confirmed their inaccuracy shortly after publication by sending a reporter to the singer's house, who quickly discovered that all of his guard dogs were quite capable of barking.|$|E
500|$|In Dannemann's initial statements, {{she said}} she <b>awoke</b> <b>at</b> 11 a.m. on September 18. During the inquest she stated that she <b>awoke</b> <b>at</b> 10:20a.m., and left to {{purchase}} cigarettes, something she had previously failed to mention. In 1971, she wrote a manuscript in which {{she said she}} <b>awoke</b> <b>at</b> 10 a.m. In 1975, during an interview with author Caesar Glebbeek, Dannemann stated that she <b>awoke</b> <b>at</b> 9 a.m. According to Burdon, Dannemann phoned him as [...] "the first light of dawn was coming through the window." [...] Stickells said he {{received a phone call}} regarding a problem with Hendrix [...] "between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m." [...] Mitchell said he waited for Hendrix at the Speakeasy Club until they closed at 4 a.m., and a couple of hours after his hour and a half drive home, he {{received a phone call from}} Stickells, who told him Hendrix had died. In her statements to the police and coroner's office, Dannemann never mentioned telephoning Burdon.|$|R

I remember the weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; I remember the brittle sound of the camel's hooves crushing the frozen snow; and I remember the mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} {{prescribed}} Benzedrine, the wonder drug of the 1950s. Regarded {{then as a}} harmless stimulant, {{it belongs to the}} family of drugs called amphetamines, and at that time they were prescribed and used in a very casual way. Among the side effects of Benzedrine are insomnia, restlessness, and mood swings, all of which Eden suffered during the Suez Crisis; indeed, earlier in his premiership he complained of being kept <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> night by the sound of motor scooters. Eden's drug use is now commonly agreed to {{have been a part of}} the reason for his bad judgment while Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|On November 24, 1966 (Thanksgiving Day), Hughes {{arrived in}} Las Vegas by {{railroad}} car {{and moved into}} the Desert Inn. Because he refused to leave the hotel and to avoid further conflicts with the owners, Hughes bought the Desert Inn in early 1967. The hotel's eighth floor became the nerve center of Hughes' empire and the ninth-floor penthouse became his personal residence. Between 1966 and 1968, he bought several other hotel-casinos, including the Castaways, New Frontier, the Landmark Hotel and Casino, and the Sands. He bought the small Silver Slipper casino {{for the sole purpose}} of moving its trademark neon silver slipper. Visible from Hughes' bedroom, it had apparently kept him <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> night.|$|E

25|$|Medical {{research}} {{on the effects of}} excessive light on the human body suggests that a variety of adverse health effects may be caused by light pollution or excessive light exposure, and some lighting design textbooks use human health as an explicit criterion for proper interior lighting. Health effects of over-illumination or improper spectral composition of light may include: increased headache incidence, worker fatigue, medically defined stress, decrease in sexual function and increase in anxiety. Likewise, animal models have been studied demonstrating unavoidable light to produce adverse effect on mood and anxiety. For those who need to be <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> night, light at night also has an acute effect on alertness and mood.|$|E
25|$|Nocturnal {{animals have}} higher body temperatures, greater activity, rising serotonin, and {{diminishing}} cortisol during the night—the inverse of diurnal animals. Nocturnal and diurnal animals both have increased electrical {{activity in the}} suprachiasmatic nucleus, and corresponding secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland, at night. Nocturnal mammals, which tend to stay <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> night, have higher melatonin at night just like diurnal mammals do. And, although removing the pineal gland in many animals abolishes melatonin rhythms, it does not stop circadian rhythms altogether—though it may alter them and weaken their responsiveness to light cues. Cortisol levels in diurnal animals typically rise throughout the night, peak in the awakening hours, and diminish during the day. In diurnal animals, sleepiness increases during the night.|$|E
25|$|The race to win {{the prize}} {{required}} time-saving design compromises, Donald A. Hall decided that the empennage (tail assembly) and wing control surfaces would not be altered from his original Ryan M-2 design, thus minimizing redesign time that was not available without delaying the flight. The result was less aerodynamic stability; nevertheless, the experienced Lindbergh approved the unaltered design. This setup resulted in a negatively stable design that tended to randomly introduce unanticipated pitch, yaw, and bank (roll) elements into its overall flight characteristics. There is dispute regarding whether Hall and Lindbergh also preferred this design because they anticipated that the continuous corrections to the random movements of the aircraft would help to keep Lindbergh awake during the estimated 40-hour flight. Whether or not the unstable design was deliberately retained to help fight fatigue, Lindbergh did later write how these random unanticipated movements helped keep him <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> various times during the flight. The stiff wicker seat in the cockpit was also purposely uncomfortable, although custom fitted to Lindbergh's tall and lanky frame.|$|E

500|$|Richard Curtis {{developed}} the film from thoughts while lying <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> night. He described {{the starting point}} as [...] "the idea of a very normal person going out with an unbelievably famous person and how that impinges on their lives". Four Weddings and a Funeral director Mike Newell was approached but rejected it to work on Pushing Tin. He said that in commercial terms {{he had made the}} wrong decision, but did not regret it. The producer, Duncan Kenworthy, then turned to Roger Michell, saying that [...] "Finding someone as good as Roger, was just like finding the right actor to play each role. Roger shone out." ...|$|E
500|$|While in high school, Garland {{also played}} Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) {{basketball}} with the Philly Pride. Amauro Austin, a statistician for the Philadelphia Daily News, directed the program while Garland was there. Austin commented, [...] "Everybody liked Ty. Not one person didn't. He was loyal, honest; just a solid-gold individual. He didn't have a malicious {{bone in his}} body". Garland often slept {{during the day and}} stayed <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> night, leading his peers to {{think of him as a}} vampire. Before becoming a senior, he led the Pride to sixth place at the under-17 national AAU tournament in Orlando, Florida. The team finished with an 8–1 record due largely to Garland's contributions.|$|E

He felt humiliated that the prison officers made such demand and said [...] "They shined a flashlight into the bed, depending on the prison officer. Called into the cell Are you alive, are you alive, until I woke up. Then they had the sign of life that they needed. Countless times I was <b>awoken</b> <b>at</b> night".|$|R
500|$|After {{the start}} of his {{management}} career, Epstein started taking stimulants, usually Preludin, which did not require a prescription at the time. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr had also taken it since their days in Hamburg. Epstein explained his use of the drug as the only means of staying <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> night during numerous concert tours. In 1964, Peter Brown suspected that Epstein was taking too many pills, as he would often cough at parties, which Brown realised was Epstein's way of secretly putting pills into his mouth without anyone noticing. McCartney often met Epstein at late night clubs in London, and remembered that Epstein would often grind his jaws (possibly due to bruxism), once saying to him, [...] "Ugghhh, the pills". Epstein also developed dependencies on the drug carbromal, a barbiturate-like sedative/hypnotic drug.|$|E
500|$|Based on the {{positive}} response he had received in San Francisco, MGM again cast Tracy as a priest in Boys Town (1938). Portraying Edward J. Flanagan, a Catholic priest and founder of Boys Town, was a role Tracy took seriously: [...] "I'm so anxious {{to do a good}} job as Father Flanagan that it worries me, keeps me <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> night." [...] Tracy received strong reviews for his performance, and the movie grossed $4 million worldwide. For the second year running, Tracy received an Academy Award for Best Actor. He was humble about the recognition, saying in his acceptance speech: [...] "I honestly do not feel that I can accept this award... I can accept it only as it was meant to be for a great man—Father Flanagan". He immediately sent the Academy Award statuette to Flanagan. Tracy was listed as the fifth biggest money-making star of 1938.|$|E
500|$|Quentin {{tries to}} accept that his nightmares {{are nothing more than}} {{repressed}} memories, but he falls asleep during swim practice and witnesses what really happened to Krueger: Everyone's parents hunted down Krueger and burned him alive. Quentin and Nancy believe that Krueger wants revenge on them for lying as children. As a result of their insomnia, they begin sporadically dreaming while they are still awake. To try to stop Krueger, they decide to go to the preschool and learn what they can. On the way, Nancy falls asleep and is attacked by Krueger, but when Quentin wakes her up, they discover she has pulled a piece of Krueger's sweater out of the dreamworld and into reality. Quentin takes Nancy to the hospital; there, he steals some adrenaline to help them stay <b>awake.</b> <b>At</b> the preschool, Quentin uncovers Krueger's hidden room and evidence that proves Krueger was in fact abusing all of the children; [...] Krueger actually wants revenge on them for telling the truth.|$|E
