[...] In the quarterfinal victory against Kyrgios, Raonic tied a career-high with 39 aces. In the semifinals, Raonic lost to Federer in straight sets. After the match, Raonic reflected: [...] "There's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> to take from it. ... But when you get here to this point, I think it's just human nature, the greed of human nature, that you want so much more. [...] You feel {{it in front of}} you and you want to grab it." [...] Despite the loss, Raonic saw his world ranking improve to a career-high No. 6.|$|E

2500|$|This left Barrichello in {{the lead}} with Schumacher Ferrari, minus a front-wing, in second place and his brother Ralf in third. Michael Schumacher came into the pits for a new nose, {{promoting}} Ralf to second. The second lap saw a collision between the two Jordans of Giancarlo Fisichella and Takuma Sato, when the latter ran {{into the back of}} the former. [...] "I am really sorry about what happened," [...] said Sato after the race, [...] "I apologized to Giancarlo immediately after the race and he took it very well which I think says <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> about his character" [...] he added.

It's allowed us to do things like push security patches that go through the whole enterprise that's on NMCI. If you look at NMCI historically, it was probably the first step for the Navy to move into what was then called Joint Vision 2010 and now is Joint Vision 2020. It's actually done that, and it's moving the Navy toward the U.S. Defense Department's goal of information superiority. So, I see <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> with NMCI." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{made his}} first {{start of the season}} against the Texans on September 30, 2007. Teammate Michael Boley said of Lewis {{starting}} [...] "He's shown <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>things,</b> Coming in as a rookie, he's accepting his responsibility now. With us releasing Grady, there's {{going to be a big}} weight on his shoulders and I think he's going to take it in stride." [...] He was then listed as the Starting Defensive Tackle in week 10 after the Falcons cut veteran Grady Jackson. During training camp, his number was listed as #67, because in college, he was #76, but that number was already taken. Then his number was changed to #97 before the season began because an older falcons player had the same number as him. He finished the 2007 NFL season with 23 tackles and one interception. Because of his size, Lewis played both Defensive Tackle and Nose Tackle during the season. According To Lewis, the most hard adjustment from NCAA Division II to the NFL was working on his Technique. Around this time, Lewis lost 20pounds and slimmed down to 294pounds.|$|E

2500|$|Michigan Tech hosted Wisconsin for a two-game series the {{following}} weekend {{to open its}} WCHA conference schedule, but did so without junior defenseman Tommy Brown, who underwent an appendectomy that week. Pearson wanted his team to play with more discipline so as to limit the Badgers' power play chances, and the Huskies responded by taking one penalty through the first two periods of the Friday game. Michigan Tech freshman Tanner Kero opened the scoring {{in the second period}} with his first career goal by deflecting a shot from Riley Sweeney. In the third period, however, the Huskies incurred two consecutive penalties in the first seven minutes, and Wisconsin forward Tyler Barnes beat Josh Robinson for a power play goal. The Huskies outshot the Badgers 16–8 in the third period, but could not put the puck past Landon Peterson to win the game in regulation. Nearly three minutes into the overtime period, Michigan Tech started a dump-and-chase and Peterson stopped the puck behind his net, but he collided with teammate John Ramage while the Huskies forechecked, leaving Jordan Baker to score on an undefended goal and win the game. In the Saturday game, Wisconsin started Joel Rumpel at goaltender and Huskies forwards Kero and Blake Pietila each scored a power play goal on a deflection. Midway through the second period, Wisconsin scored off a rebound after Robinson stopped the initial shot. Michigan Tech killed off a five-minute major penalty to Alex MacLeod in the third period, but the Badgers tied the game with two minutes remaining. Twenty seconds into overtime, however, Huskies captain Brett Olson scored on a wrap-around shot that went through Rumpel's five-hole for the win. Pearson was pleased with his team's performance, saying, [...] "Our kids are working hard, there's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> going on in our locker room and we see it every day as coaches". Robinson was named WCHA Defensive Player of the Week after stopping 44 of 47shots in the series.|$|E
2500|$|For instance, {{there is}} an {{underlying}} bitterness between Dan Miller and Nicola Murray in the fourth season because Murray reportedly won leadership on a [...] "technicality," [...] despite not having the leadership material that Miller has, {{a reference to the}} events of the 2010 Labour leadership election, which saw Ed Miliband become leader over his brother, David, which likewise came down to a technicality in the voting procedure. Throughout the series, Mannion's party is linked by Malcolm and his co-workers to snobbishness, emotional suppression, upper-class institutions such as Eton College. On another occasion, Mannion – who, though fairly moderate compared to others within his party, is nevertheless a member of the [...] "old guard" [...] - complains to Stewart Pearson about the hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition and his [...] "Eton clique" [...] who are ostensibly trying to modernise their party by expelling its bigoted and old-fashioned members while routinely texting each other racist jokes in private. Upon being fired, Pearson sums up his time in the party by remarking that his efforts to modernise the party by fixing the undesirable views of its members made no difference to the inherent issues that went to its foundations. In the fourth season, Glenn Cullen is often seen to complain to Terri and Ollie about Fergus's willingness to throw his lot in with a party whose policies vastly contradicted their own, having left his original party because of disillusionment with their political pragmatism. Perhaps the clearest indication of the real-life basis for the fictional parties and events is a comment by Phil Smith, who belongs to Mannion's party: [...] "... <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> came out of the 80s: (…) deregulation of the stock exchange, us being in power...". The mainstream media and general public are commonly portrayed in equally unflattering terms, being portrayed as aggressively hounding politicians and asking awkward, often outrageous questions, or otherwise being discourteous and harsh.|$|E

Fleda didn't understand his explanation unless it had reference to another and more wonderful exchange--the restoration to the great house not only of its tables and chairs, but of its alienated mistress. This would imply the installation of his own life at Ricks, and obviously that of another person. Such another person could scarcely be Mona Brigstock.
