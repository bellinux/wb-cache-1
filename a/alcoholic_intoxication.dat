40|$|SummaryInflammation can {{be either}} {{beneficial}} or detrimental to the liver, depending on multiple factors. Mild (i. e., limited in intensity and destined to resolve) inflammatory responses have indeed been shown to exert consistent hepatoprotective effects, contributing to tissue repair and promoting the re-establishment of homeostasis. Conversely, excessive (i. e., disproportionate in intensity and permanent) inflammation may induce a massive loss of hepatocytes and hence exacerbate the severity of various hepatic conditions, including ischemia-reperfusion injury, systemic metabolic alterations (e. g., obesity, diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disorders), <b>alcoholic</b> hepatitis, <b>intoxication</b> by xenobiotics and infection, de facto being associated with irreversible liver damage, fibrosis, and carcinogenesis. Both liver-resident cells (e. g., Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells) and cells that are recruited in response to injury (e. g., monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells) emit pro-inflammatory signals including – {{but not limited to}} – cytokines, chemokines, lipid messengers, and reactive oxygen species that contribute to the apoptotic or necrotic demise of hepatocytes. In turn, dying hepatocytes release damage-associated molecular patterns that-upon binding to evolutionary conserved pattern recognition receptors-activate cells of the innate immune system to further stimulate inflammatory responses, hence establishing a highly hepatotoxic feedforward cycle of inflammation and cell death. In this review, we discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms that account for the most deleterious effect of hepatic inflammation at the cellular level, that is, the initiation of a massive cell death response among hepatocytes...|$|R

40|$|Background: In February, 2005, the canton of Geneva in Switzerland {{prohibited}} the off-premise sale of alcoholic beverages between 9 pm and 7 am, and banned their sale in gas stations and video stores. The {{aim of this}} study is to assess the impact of this policy change on hospital admission rates for <b>alcoholic</b> <b>intoxication.</b> Methods: An interrupted time series analysis of this natural experiment was performed with data on hospitalisations for acute <b>alcoholic</b> <b>intoxication</b> during the 2002 - 2007 period. The canton of Geneva was treated as the experimental group, while all other Swiss cantons were used as the control group. Results: In the experimental site, the policy change was found to have a significant effect on admission rates among adolescents and young adults. Depending on the age group, hospitalisation rates for <b>alcoholic</b> <b>intoxication</b> fell by an estimated 25 - 40 % as the result of restricted alcohol availability. Conclusions: Modest restrictions on opening hours and the density of off-premise outlets were found to be of relevance for public health in the canton of Geneva. In light of this finding, policy makers should consider such action as a promising approach to alcohol prevention. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{forensic}} studies published {{during the last}} 50 years report that intoxication with alcohol influences speech {{in a way that}} is made manifest in certain features of the speech signal. However, most of these studies are based on data that are not publicly available nor of statistically sufficient size. Furthermore, in spite of the positive reports nobody ever successfully implemented a method to detect <b>alcoholic</b> <b>intoxication</b> from the speech signal. The Alcohol Language Corpus (ALC) aims to answer these open questions by providing a publicly available large and statistically sound corpus of intoxicated and sober speech. This paper gives a detailed description of the corpus features and methodology.

A control population of 62 apparently healthy subjects, age and sex matched, were also tested. Alcoholaemia, aCL, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and Treponema pallidum immobilisation (TPHA) were determined. The mean alcoholaemia among all patients tested was 2. 35 g l- 1 (range 0. 1 - 4). aCL were found positive in 10 patients (16 %); eight men and two women. Seven patients had aCL IgG level of &ge; 15 UG PL/ml while two had IgM level of &ge; 12. 5 UMPL/ml. One had both elevated aCL IgG and IgM. Statistical analysis confirmed that aCL positivity is more frequently encountered in alcoholic patients compared with an age and sex matched population (P = 0. 0298). Among alcoholic patients, 12 (19 %) had ANA. Four of them were VDRL positive while all were TPHA negative. Two of the 62 control subjects were found aCL positive.
