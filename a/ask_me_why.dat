500|$|Laurence Olivier {{was paid}} $1 million to play General Douglas MacArthur in the film. He was {{contracted}} {{for six weeks}} of filming, and received a payment of $250,000 upon signing the contract and the remainder was given in four subsequent installments. His salary came out to $50,000 per day. In addition to this fee, Olivier also received $2,500 per week for his expenses. Olivier was interviewed during the film's production and explained why he agreed {{to be part of}} its cast: [...] "People <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>why</b> I'm playing in this picture. The answer is simple. Money, dear boy. I'm like a vintage wine. You have to drink me quickly before I turn sour. I'm almost used up now and I can feel the end coming. That's why I'm taking money now. I've got nothing to leave my family but the money I can make from films. Nothing is beneath me if it pays well. I've earned the right to damn well grab whatever I can in the time I've got left." ...|$|E
500|$|Agnew's first {{marriage}} was to Beverley in 1983; it {{ended in divorce}} in 1992, a year after he became BBC cricket correspondent. He has written about the role that cricket played {{in the collapse of}} the relationship, comparing his circumstances with those of then England batsman Graham Thorpe. He also found that his job interfered with his relationship with his children: I had two young children, aged seven and five... it was quickly evident that for me to have custody of my daughters – or even to form a relationship with them – was made impossible by my job. What chance do you have when, be it playing Test cricket or commentating on it, you are away {{for months at a time}} each and every winter?... There was one occasion when I did not recognise my eldest, Jennifer, when I returned from one tour... my children continue to <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>why</b> I did not resign and take a job that would have kept me in the country and allowed me to see them more often. I find that one especially hard to answer." [...] Agnew has subsequently remarried: he met Emma Agnew, current editor of BBC East Midlands Today, when they worked together on BBC Radio Leicestershire.|$|E
500|$|Garrett {{initially}} wrote [...] "Soldier" [...] {{in a taxi}} while {{going to}} the studio where the band worked on Destiny Fulfilled; he sang the hook to the members afterwards and they liked it. Garrett further revealed about his collaboration with the group, [...] "I loved how Destiny's Child evolved and became this really incredible pop group but I wanted to introduce them to the hood {{from the perspective of}} having the world look at them in a different way... What was great about that was they all liked guys from the streets. Each verse was a representation of the guy they were actually into." [...] During an interview with MTV News, Rowland said that with [...] "Soldier" [...] each member wanted to talk about their preference for a man during their solo verses, the place where he lives and his physical appearance. Beyoncé stated that as the song had a [...] "Southern feel" [...] and beat, they wanted to collaborate with Lil Wayne and T.I. who according to her added [...] "rawness, realness and edge to the song". During an interview in 2014, Lil Wayne discussed his contribution in the song, [...] "That set me off. Them little eight bars right there, that got me there boy. If you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>why,</b> it was Beyoncé. That shit was big." [...] "Soldier" [...] was included on the group's compilation albums #1's (2005) and [...] (2012).|$|E

Children tell little more than animals, for what comes to them they accept as eternally established. Also, badly-treated children have a clear notion {{of what they are}} likely to get if they betray the secrets of a prison-house before they are clear of it".|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, {{some people}} have {{considered}} that the song's opening guitar arpeggios bear a close resemblance to the 1968 instrumental [...] "Taurus" [...] by the Los Angeles-based rock band Spirit, written by Spirit guitarist Randy California. In the liner notes to the 1996 reissue of Spirit's self-titled debut album, California wrote: [...] "People always <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>why</b> [...] "Stairway to Heaven" [...] sounds exactly like [...] "Taurus", which was released two years earlier.

2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Black Cat" [...] was {{directed}} by Wayne Isham. It was filmed on April 5, 1990 using live concert footage from Jackson's Rhythm Nation World Tour at the Met Center in Bloomington, Minnesota. In addition to the audience for the sold-out show, the filming reportedly drew an additional 3,000 fans. The video premiered during the tour's first date at the Tacoma Dome, projected on three screens prior to Jackson appearing on stage. It was later debuted on MTV and other music channels in August. The video uses an [...] "in concert" [...] theme, in a similar concept to other hard rock and heavy metal music videos of the era, being a departure from her heavily choreographed videos with various settings. Spliced footage of a black panther is shown throughout the video. Jackson explained, [...] "Black panthers fascinate me. They've become an obsession. During filming, we used a black panther who actually attacked his trainer. Don't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>why,</b> but I was never fearful. I feel a strange rapport with panthers. They've become an inner symbol. Maybe it's their beauty, maybe their danger, maybe the poetry of their movement. It's as though their strength protects me." [...] It was later included on the Rhythm Nation Compilation and Design of a Decade video release.|$|E
2500|$|With sturdy Northern resolution, Mr. Biggar in {{the last}} hour of the sitting of the House of Commons yesterday, assailed and {{defeated}} the Threshing Machines Bill. If your readers <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>why</b> Mr. Biggar defeated the Threshing Machines Bill, I really must confess my inability to inform them. Perhaps it was that the Bill was proposed by Mr. Chaplin, and perhaps Mr. Biggar wished to punish Mr. Chaplin for his attack on Mr. Gladstone. It was a daring thing to do – I mean it was daring in one to get up with the knowledge that you must talk for a half an hour on Threshing Machines. But Mr. Biggar triumphed. Once or twice I really fancied all was over with the hon. member. He, to all appearance, had exhausted every possible branch of his subject, and Mr. Chaplin was already chuckling in anticipation of the break-down of his foe. But no! Mr. Biggar bethought him of [...] "the old flail". It was a moment of inspiration. Who could not talk for fifteen minutes on [...] " [...] the old flail". A groan of mortal anguish escaped Mr. Chaplin as, in eloquently rounded periods, the honourable member for Cavan turned over, ogled, turned over again, and genially touched upon the beauties of flails. At length the hour struck. Mr. Biggar sank down victorious, and Mr. Chaplin rushed in anger from the House.|$|E
2500|$|After Zappa began regular {{occupation}} at Paul Buff's PAL Studio in Cucamonga he and Van Vliet began collaborating, tentatively as the Soots (pronounced [...] "soots" [...] ). By {{the time}} Zappa {{had turned the}} venue into [...] the duo had completed some songs. These were Cheryl's Canon, Metal Man Has Won His Wings and a Howlin' Wolf styled rendition of Little Richard's Slippin' and Slidin'. Further songs, on Zappa's Mystery Disc (1996), I Was a Teen-Age Malt Shop and The Birth of Captain Beefheart also provide an insight to Zappa's [...] "teenage movie" [...] script titled Captain Beefheart vs. the Grunt People, the first appearances of the Beefheart name. It has been suggested this name came from a term used by Vliet's Uncle Alan who {{had a habit of}} exposing himself to Don's girlfriend, Laurie Stone. He would urinate with the bathroom door open and, if she was walking by, would mumble about his penis, saying [...] "Ahh, what a beauty! It looks just like a big, fine beef heart". [...] In a 1970 interview with Rolling Stone, Van Vliet requests [...] "don't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>why</b> or how" [...] he and Zappa came up with the name. Johnny Carson also asked him the same question to which Van Vliet replied that one day he was standing on the pier and saw fishermen cutting the bills off pelicans. He said it made him sad and put [...] "a beef in his heart". Carson appeared nervous and uncomfortable interviewing Van Vliet and after the next commercial break Van Vliet was gone. He would later claim in an appearance on Late Night with David Letterman that the name referred to [...] "a beef in my heart against this society". In the [...] "Grunt People" [...] draft script Beefheart and his mother play themselves, with his father played by Howlin' Wolf. Grace Slick is penned in as a [...] "celestial seductress" [...] and there are also roles for future Magic Band members Bill Harkleroad and Mark Boston.|$|E
