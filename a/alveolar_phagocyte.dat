40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the effect of two arsenic-containing particles, coal fly ash (FA) and copper smelter dust (CU), on lung integrity and on the ex vivo release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by <b>alveolar</b> <b>phagocytes.</b> Particle effects were compared in nonoverload condition on the basis of a low but identical volume load and arsenic content intratracheally instilled in the mouse lung (273 nl/mouse and 186 ng arsenic/mouse; FAL and CUL groups). Other mice received 600 ng arsenic/mouse in amounts of particles leading to different volume loads (FAH and CUH groups: 880 and 273 nl/mouse, respectively). Animals were sacrificed at 1, 6, 30, or 120 d (FAL and CUL groups) or at 6 and 120 d posttreatment (FAH and CUH groups). Biochemical markers and inflammatory cell number and type were analyzed in bronchoalveolar lavage, ex vivo TNF-alpha production by <b>alveolar</b> <b>phagocytes</b> was assessed, and measurement of arsenic lung content and histopathological examinations were performed. Our results show that coal fly ash and copper smelter dust bear distinct inflammatory properties. At the end of the observation period (d 120), the high CU dose (CUH) produced a fibrotic reaction whereas the high dose of FA particles (FAH) generated a delayed and persistent lung inflammatory reaction associated with lymphoid noduli. Marked differences in TNF-alpha production were observed within the CU and FA groups. CU particles, conceivably through their metal content, decreased TNF-alpha production by <b>alveolar</b> <b>phagocytes.</b> Due to their low arsenic content, considerably higher FA particle doses needed to be administered to produce an inhibition of TNF-alpha production. Since high doses of FA (FAH) caused an overload condition, our results do not allow us to decide whether FA-mediated TNF-alpha reduction is due to the load administered or to the metallic content...|$|R
40|$|Activation of <b>phagocytes</b> (<b>alveolar</b> macrophages [AM] and {{neutrophil}} polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMN]) {{can cause}} tissue damage in inflammatory lung diseases. {{in this study}} we investigated whether phagocytes {{contribute to the development of}} tissue damage in lung grafts histologically observed during two different processes: the reimplantation response and the acute rejection. Therefore, the number and profile of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood phagocytes and their in vitro spontaneous and serum-treated-zymosan (STZ) -stimulated O 2 - production were assessed after allogeneic (BN to LEW) and syngeneic (LEW to LEW) transplantation of the left lung in rats. BAL PMN numbers increased during the reimplantation response, whereas during the late phase of the rejection process BAL AM and PMN numbers were increased. The O 2 - production by the BAL phagocytes and blood PMN were not increased at any stage. Strikingly, the STZ-stimulated O 2 - production by the BAL phagocytes was significantly impaired during acute rejection. Our data suggest that activation of the O 2 - production by bronchoalveolar phagocytes does not play an important role in the development of tissue damage in lung transplants during the reimplantation response and acute rejection. The impaired O 2 - production by <b>alveolar</b> <b>phagocytes</b> during acute lung rejection may contribute to the increased susceptibility for pulmonary infections after lung transplantation...|$|R

A relationship could be established between resistance to H 2 O 2, catalase activity and virulence amongst the strains. Virulent strains resisted the bactericidal activity generated by the xanthine oxidase system; avirulent strains did not.

In Legionella pneumophila, Mip promotes infection of both human macrophages and freshwater protozoa. Southern hybridization and immunoblot analyses demonstrated that mip sequences were present and expressed within a panel of virulent L. micdadei strains. Using allelic exchange mutagenesis, we then constructed an L. micdadei strain that completely and specifically lacked Mip. Although unimpaired {{in its ability to}} grow in bacteriologic media, this Mip mutant was defective in its capacity to infect U 937 cells, a human macrophage-like cell line. Most significantly, the Mip- organism displayed a 24 -fold reduction in survivability immediately after its entry into the phagocyte. Similarly, the mutant was less able to parasitize Hartmannella amoebae. Taken together, these data argue that Mip specifically potentiates intracellular growth by L. micdadei...|$|R

The intracellular environment could affect the bacilli in several ways: the phagocytic enzymes could alter the physical and chemical integrity of the bacillus resulting in its destruction, or the intracellular environment could merely modify metabolic pathways or rates. For a study of the metabolic fate of tubercle bacilli within phagocytes, techniques had to be developed which would allow one to differentiate between the metabolic activities of the host cell and of the parasite.

40|$|Tetrandrine is an {{alkaloid}} {{obtained from}} the root of a medicinal herb which is employed in China {{as a treatment for}} silicosis. One proposed mechanism for the development of silica-induced fibrosis is lung damage resulting from particle-induced inflammation and secretion of reactive compounds from <b>alveolar</b> <b>phagocytes.</b> Therefore, the objective {{of the present study was}} to determine if tetrandrine exhibited the ability to inhibit respiratory burst activity of pulmonary phagocytes. The data indicate that although tetrandrine is not cytotoxic to phagocytic cells, it is a potent inhibitor in vitro of zymosan-stimulated oxygen consumption, superoxide anion release, and hydrogen peroxide secretion by alveolar macrophages. Tetrandrine is also effective in vivo in preventing activation of alveolar macrophages after inhalation or intratracheal instillation of silica. Tetrandrine also inhibits stimulant-induced chemiluminescence by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Since tetrandrine does not alter stimulant-induced depolarization of phagocytic cells, its inhibitory action is not via interference with receptor-ligand binding but rather must occur elsewhere in the stimulus-secretion coupling scheme.

Increased efferocytosis by APs results in protection against lethal acute lung injury due to pulmonary infections whereas defective efferocytosis by APs results in chronic lung inflammation. In this report, {{we show that}} pulmonary delivery of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) significantly enhances efferocytosis by APs. Increased efferocytosis by APs maintains lung homeostasis and protects mice against lethal influenza pneumonia. Intranasally treated wild type C 57 Bl/ 6 (WT) mice with BCG showed significant increase in APs efferocytosis in vivo compared to their PBS-treated counterparts. All BCG-treated WT mice survived lethal influenza A virus (IAV) infection whereas all PBS-treated mice succumbed. BCG-induced resistance was abrogated by depleting AP prior to IAV infection. BCG treatment increased uptake, and digestion/removal of apoptotic cells by APs. BCG significantly increased the expression of TIM 4 on APs and increased expression of Rab 5 and Rab 7. We demonstrated that increased efferocytosis by APs through pulmonary delivery of BCG initiated rapid clearance of apoptotic cells from the alveolar space, maintained lung homeostasis, reduced inflammation and protected host against lethal IAV pneumonia...|$|R
40|$|Bordetella {{pertussis}} can attach, invade {{and survive}} intracellularly in human macrophages in vitro. To study {{the significance of}} this bacterial feature in vivo, we analyzed the presence of viable bacteria in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) cells of mice infected with B, pertussis. We found B. pertussis to be present in a viable state in BAL fluid cells until at least 19 days after infection, suggesting B. pertussis to be able to survive in those cells. This intracellular niche may {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of pertussis. Pertussis toxin and the RGD sequence of the virulence factor filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) both play a rule in the attachment of B. pertussis to human and mouse macrophages in vitro and Lye hypothesized these virulence factors to be required for invasion and subsequent intracellular survival of B. pertussis in macrophages in vivo. A B. pertussis double mutant, in which the FHA RGD motif was changed to RAD and the ptx genes were deleted, was also found in a viable state in BAL fluid cells, albeit at lower levels than the wild-type strain. In our model, uptake of B. pertussis by <b>alveolar</b> <b>phagocytes</b> in vivo is thus, at least in part, determined by the bacterial virulence factors FHA and pertussis toxin.

A selective release of 4 - 8 % of the lysosomal beta-glucuronidase of these cells occurred within 30 min {{of contact with}} the related allergen or with anti-human IgE antibody, {{in the absence of}} any mast or basophil cells. The cell reactivity was dependent on the interaction of macrophages with IgE, as shown by the disappearance of the allergen-induced enzyme release after heating or IgE-immune adsorption of the sensitizing serum, but not after IgG-adsorption. Alveolar macrophages from asthmatic patients behaved similarly to passively sensitized normal macrophages. Contact with the related allergen or with anti-IgE antibody induced the same percentage of enzyme release, demonstrating that these cells possess allergen-specific IgE bound on their surface. 18 % of them formed rosettes with anti-IgE-coated sheep erythrocytes, and 15 - 22 % with allergen-coated erythrocytes, but lost this property after preincubation with the specific allergen. The presence of IgE-specific receptors on the macrophage surface was demonstrated both at the ultrastructural level with immunoperoxidase labeling, and at low magnification by the formation of 15 - 18 % rosettes with human IgE-coated erythrocytes. The formation of such rosettes was inhibited after incubation of <b>alveolar</b> <b>phagocytes</b> with aggregated myeloma IgE. On the basis of these observations, the participation of the alveolar macrophages in IgE-mediated pulmonary hypersensitivity must be considered.

40|$|If genetically {{resistant}} and susceptible rabbits inhale {{a certain}} number of human type tubercle bacilli, no tuberculosis in the lungs of the resistant animals is seen, as a rule several months after infection, while there is a variable and often extensive disease in the susceptible rabbits. The analogy to {{the presence or absence of}} active tuberculosis in man infected with the tubercle bacillus is evident. The inhaled tubercle bacilli multiply for but a short time in the resistant rabbits and are usually rapidly and completely destroyed. In the susceptible rabbits, the bacilli multiply profusely for a much longer time and persist in large numbers even months after inhalation. Whatever be the cause of the more rapid destruction of tubercle bacilli in the resistant animal, the resulting more rapid release of the contained antigens enhances the development of allergic sensitivity and antibodies in these animals. The development of an acquired resistance against tubercle bacilli of the human type is sufficiently rapid to affect the genesis of the initial gross primary pulmonary foci that result from the inhalation of a given number of bacilli. The greater the genetic resistance, the fewer the initial primary foci. Variations in genetic resistance are essentially variations in the rate of development of acquired resistance. It is suggested that variations in genetic resistance to inhaled human type tubercle bacilli may affect the prevalence of <b>alveolar</b> <b>phagocytes</b> capable of acquiring adequate resistance to the growth of the bacilli in their cytoplasm.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} {{of acute}} respiratory melioidosis mice and hamsters is described. Inhaled organisms {{giving rise to}} lesions seemed to be first engulfed by the mononuclear <b>alveolar</b> <b>phagocytes,</b> but in less than 1 day polymorphonuclear cells made their appearance. In spite of this defense reaction, the bacteria continued to multiply and their products caused focal necrosis. These foci enlarged and gave rise to septicemia, toxemia, and eventually death, which usually occurred in 3 to 10 days depending on the dose. Melioidosis, is, therefore, an acute septicotoxemic disease resembling plague and anthrax in this respect. In hamsters the disease process developed more rapidly than in mice and death occurred sooner. The course of the disease in hamsters was sometimes complicated by intraglomerular deposits resembling "fibrinoid," which {{were similar to those}} of the generalized Shwartzman phenomenon. This phenomenon may have been an indirect cause of both the perifocal hemorrhage and the extremely large number of bacteria in some of the hamster lesions. When low infecting doses of organisms were employed, mice, but not hamsters, developed a chronic type of disease, lasting 2 to 8 weeks. This was characterized by large abscesses in the spleen or lung, marked proliferation of mononuclear phagocytes and plasma cells, and increased immunity against reinfection (about 40 -fold against respiratory challenge). When mice and hamsters inhaled high infecting doses of organisms, a peracute disease resulted with death in 1 to 3 days. Increased numbers of bacteria were observed in the lesions, and the histological changes in the spleen resembled those following the intravenous injection of Malleomyces pseudomallei toxin or the intramuscular injection of large doses of cortisone. These changes were characterized by a swelling of the phagocytes of the white pulp with nuclear debris. The peracute, the acute, and the chronic forms of melioidosis in mice are similar to analogous clinical forms found in man...|$|R
40|$|Genetics of {{susceptibility}} to infection {{is a complex}} trait in which many factors from the host, the parasite and the environment, interact to produce different clinical manifestations of disease. This thesis explores {{the relationship between the}} first infectious susceptibility gene ever cloned, SLC 11 A 1 and the occurrence of intracellular infections (leprosy, leishmaniasis and HIV infection) in several populations of humans. It also demonstrates the use of an animal model as the basis for mapping new susceptibility loci for tuberculosis. Through this work it was found that part of the effect of {{susceptibility to}} leprosy per se in Vietnamese families is under the control of SLC 11 A 1 In addition, this gene appears to influence the immune response to the Mitsuda reaction (which indicates acquired immunity to Mycobacterium leprae) providing proof of principle that qualitative measures of immune reactivity can be mapped to particular loci in family studies. In contrast, susceptibility to leishmaniasis {{does not seem to be}} under the control of SLC 11 A 1. Additionally, this thesis shows that allelic variants of SLC 11 A 1 are associated with altered risk of HIV infection. This work also includes further analysis on previously detected susceptibility loci in the A/Sn x I/St mouse model of tuberculosis. The results of the study allow a more precise location of candidate susceptibility regions and provide evidence that gene x gene interactions can be studied in animal models of disease. We found evidence of multigenic control to severity of disease in mice, since QTLs on chromosomes 9 (tbs 2), 3 (tbs 1) and 17, interacted to modify the phenotype. An additional interacting locus on chromosome X (lmr 3) provided support for explaining previously observed sex effects on the phenotype. Phagocytes derived from I/Sn animals appear to have a defect in their phagocytic activity compared to cells obtained from A/Sn mice since Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected cells are more abundant and contain more bacteria in I/St mice.

Mice received tungsten carbide (WC) alone (100 mg/kg), FA alone (100 mg/kg, i. e., 20 micrograms arsenic/kg), CU mixed with WC (CU, 13. 6 mg/kg, i. e., 20 micrograms arsenic/kg; WC, 86. 4 mg/kg) and Ca 3 (AsO 4) 2 mixed with WC (20 micrograms arsenic/kg; WC, 100 mg/kg). Animals were sacrificed at 1, 6, or 30 d posttreatment and analyzed by bronchoalveolar lavage for total protein (TP) content, inflammatory cell number and type, and TNF-alpha production. Additional mice were studied to evaluate particle retention by measuring total arsenic retention in the lung at appropriate times. Instillation of WC induced a mild and transient (d 1) inflammatory reaction characterized by an increase of TP and an influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the alveolar compartment. Compared to WC, Ca 3 (AsO 4) 2 produced a significant increase of TP content in BALF. CU particles caused a severe but transient inflammatory reaction, while a persisting alveolitis (30 d) was observed after treatment with FA. Compared to control saline, a marked inhibition of TNF-alpha release was observed in response to LPS in all groups at d 1. Cytokine production was upregulated in WC- and Ca 3 (AsO 4) 1 -treated animals after 6 and 30 d, respectively. However, a 90 % inhibition of TNF-alpha production was still observed at d 30 after administration of CU and FA. Although arsenic was cleared from the lung tissue 6 d after Ca 3 (AsO 4) 2 administration, a significant fraction persisted (10 - 15 % of the arsenic administered) in the lung of CU- and FA-treated mice at d 30.

Autophagy in the cells is induced by ATP, vitamin D, cytokines. ATP is known to increase the intracellular calcium level that facilitates autophagy. Calcimining, an important calcium ionosphere increases the intracellular calcium level thus facilitates autophagy.

Polymorphonuclear leukocytes demonstrated no specific fluorescent staining after 24 h of exposure to RSV, whereas peripheral blood nonadherent mononuclear cells demonstrated a low percentage of positive cells, with a mean of 6 +/- 1 % SE. In contrast, 37 +/- 5 % of monocytes expressed RSV antigen after viral exposure. Exposure of monocytes to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 1 h prior to RSV increased the percentage of infected cells to 48 +/- 6 % and stimulated their secretion of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and alpha tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Intrinsic mononuclear phagocytic factors influencing the permissiveness to RSV were studied by determining infection of adult and cord blood and <b>alveolar</b> mononuclear <b>phagocytes</b> (MP). <b>Alveolar</b> and blood MP simultaneously isolated from adult donors were similarly infected by RSV, which varied with the viral dose.

Treatment with LPS for 1 h prior to RSV exposure did not increase infection of cord blood MP as seen with adult blood MP.

This finding runs counter to the present teachings of immunology since numerous investigators bare presented evidence that fully encapsulated pneumococci are resistant to phagocytosis except when coated with a suitable opsonin (3 - 5). Only Goodner and Miller (6) have reported appreciable phagocytosis {{in the absence of}} antibody and they have expressed doubt as to the significance of such phagocytosis, since the non-sensitized pneumococci appeared, in their experiments, to multiply within the phagocytes. The experiments already described in an accompanying paper indicate that the phagocytosis observed in the pneumonic lung during treatment with sulfonamide is due neither to the presence of type-specific opsonins in the lung nor to a direct effect of the drug upon the pneumococcus capsule (2). It would appear, therefore, that the destruction of pneumococci in the lungs is duc to other factors hitherto not understood. The nature of these factors is defined in the present paper? It has been shown in previous experiments that pneumococci inoculated upon a resolving pneumonic lesion arc quickly phagocyted and destroyed by the phagocytic cells in the alveolar exudatc. Although evidence has been presented that the phagocytosis is not due to the presence of type-specific opsonins, it is still conceivable that the phagocytic reaction in the living animal is dependent upon unknown factors which (I) are concentrated in the pneumonic exudate, (2) are brought to the alveoli by the circulating blood, or (3) are present in living pulmonary tissue.

We examined the effects of S. pneumoniae-associated alveolar epithelial cell injury by factors other than S. pneumoniae-derived pneumolysin or phagocyte products by exposing cultured rat type II alveolar epithelial cells (RAEC) to S. pneumoniae mutants that lacked pneumolysin activity. We found that mutant pneumolysin-deficient strains of S. pneumoniae produced injury to RAEC similar to that produced by the parent strains. A toxin of type 14 S. pneumoniae was distinguished from pneumolysin by physiochemical (i. e., molecular mass and heat stability) and functional (i. e., hemolytic activity and cytotoxic activity) properties and was identified as hydrogen peroxide. All S. pneumoniae strains tested produced hydrogen peroxide, and in many strains hydrogen peroxide production was comparable to that of activated neutrophils.

Since alveolar macrophages are pivotal regulators of local immunological homeostasis, their population density is decisive for the many processes of immunity in the lungs. They are highly adaptive components of the innate immune system and can be specifically modified to whatever functions needed depending on their state of differentiation and micro-environmental factors encountered. Alveolar macrophages release numerous secretory products and interact with other cells and molecules through the expression of several surface receptors. Alveolar macrophages are also involved in the phagocytosis of apoptotic and necrotic cells that have undergone cell-death. They must be selective of the material that is phagocytized because normal cells and structures of the body must not be compromised. To combat infection, the phagocytes of the innate immune system facilitates many pattern recognition receptors (PRR) to help recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the surface of pathogenic microorganisms. PAMPs all have the common features of being unique to a group of pathogens but invariant in their basic structure; and are essential for pathogenicity(ability of an organism to produce an infectious disease in another organism).

Interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) is a {{mediator}} released by stimulated mononuclear phagocytes that {{is thought to}} play an important role in modulating T and B lymphocyte activation as well as in contributing to the febrile response and other inflammatory processes.

To examine the control of IGF-I gene expression in mononuclear phagocytes, the human macrophage-like cell line U 937 was evaluated at rest and after surface activation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or Ca 2 + ionophore. Northern analysis and RNAse protection analysis with 32 P-labeled IGF-I-specific probes demonstrated that the IGF-I mRNA transcripts of resting U 937 cells were similar in size and amount to those of resting human <b>alveolar</b> macrophages, mononuclear <b>phagocytes</b> known to express the IGF-I gene. Nuclear run-off assays demonstrated that surface activation of U 937 cells increased the transcription rate of the IGF-I gene four- to fivefold, a process that was inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting that active protein synthesis {{was involved in the}} activation pathway. Despite this, cytoplasmic IGF-I mRNA levels after surface activation declined markedly, a process blocked by a protein kinase C inhibitor (for PMA activation) or a calmodulin antagonist (for Ca 2 + ionophore activation). Like the increased transcription of the IGF-I gene, modulation of IGF-I mRNA transcript levels required active protein synthesis; in the presence of cycloheximide constitutive IGF-I mRNA levels increased and surface activation no longer caused a decrease in transcript number. Interestingly, surface activation caused a rapid release of IGF-I, even {{in the presence of a}} protein synthesis inhibitor, suggesting that mononuclear phagocytes have a preformed, stored, releasable pool of IGF-I. Together these observations demonstrate that IGF-I gene expression is complex and probably involves control of transcription rate, cytoplasmic mRNA levels possibly mediated through protein kinase C, calcium influx and calmodulin, and finally, release of preformed IGF-I from a storage pool...|$|R

In addition, consistent with the findings for alveolar macrophages, macrophages generated by the in vitro maturation of blood monocytes were also deficient in their ability to release IL- 1. These findings suggest that if the population of alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage represents the total in vivo population of alveolar macrophages, although normal human macrophages are capable of IL- 1 release, they are relatively limited in this ability, and this limitation seems to be linked to the maturational state of the mononuclear phagocyte.
