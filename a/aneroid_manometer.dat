In this observational study, we studied the trend amongst anaesthesiologist in choosing the type of ETT and their ability to assess optimum ICP clinically. After institutional ethics committee approval, we observed 75 patients under general endotracheal anaesthesia in Government Medical College. Anaesthesiologists were blinded to study purpose. The type of ETT used and magnitude of ICP was recorded. ICP was measured using simple <b>aneroid</b> <b>manometer.</b> Once the pressure was measured, it was readjusted to normal range and nitrous oxide was allowed to start. Red rubber tube was used in 18. 7 % and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in 81. 3 % cases. The anaesthesiologists were not able to assess ICP in the recommended range clinically in 100 % cases when red rubber ETT was used and in 40 % cases when portex ETT was used. Red rubber ETT (reusable) with low-volume high-pressure cuff is still in use, though the trend is shifting towards more of using PVC ETT. Anaesthesiologists were not able to inflate the ETT cuff to the recommended range in spite of their clinical expertise (more than 5 years of teaching experience) in significant number of cases.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the sphygmomanometers calibration accuracy {{and the physical}} conditions of the cuff-bladder, bulb, pump, and valve. METHODS: Sixty hundred and forty five aneroid sphygmomanometers were evaluated, 521 used in private practice and 124 used in hospitals. <b>Aneroid</b> <b>manometers</b> were tested against a properly calibrated mercury manometer and were considered calibrated when the error was <= 3 mm Hg. The physical conditions of the cuffs-bladder, bulb, pump, and valve were also evaluated. RESULTS: Of the aneroid sphygmomanometers tested, 51 % of those used in private practice and 56 % of those used in hospitals {{were found to be}} not accurately calibrated. Of these, the magnitude of inaccuracy ranged from 4 to 8 mm Hg in 70 % and 51 % of the devices, respectively. The problems found in the cuffs - bladders, bulbs, pumps, and valves of the private practice and hospital devices were bladder damage (34 % vs. 21 %, respectively), holes/leaks in the bulbs (22 % vs. 4 %, respectively), and rubber aging (15 % vs. 12 %, respectively). Of the devices tested, 72 % revealed at least one problem interfering with blood pressure measurement accuracy.

40|$|Background: Endotracheal tubes (ETTs) play an {{integral}} part in anaesthesia. ETT cuff pressure commonly exceeds the recommended range of 20 - 30 cm H₂ 0 during anaesthesia. This can lead to serious morbidity. No objective means of ETT cuff pressure monitoring {{is available in the}} operating theatres of Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital (CMJAH) and Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital (CHBAH). The ETT cuff pressure of patients undergoing general anaesthesia is therefore unknown. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine what the actual ETT cuff pressures were of patients receiving general anaesthesia at CMJAH and CHBAH and to document the cuff inflation techniques that were used to achieve these pressures. Method: ETT cuff pressure of 96 adult patients undergoing general anaesthesia without nitrous oxide at CMJAH and CHBAH were measured. A RUSCH Endotest <b>aneroid</b> <b>manometer</b> was used to measure ETT cuff pressure in size 7. 0 – 8. 5 mm ETTs. The cuff inflation technique that was used by the anaesthetist was also documented.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} respiratory {{muscle strength}} (RMS) {{in a sample}} composed exclusively of healthy sedentary individuals and to compare with predicted values, to investigate the relationship between maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) and age, weight and height, and propose predictive equations of MIP and MEP for this population. METHODS: Subjects were 140 healthy and sedentary individuals: 70 males (55 ± 20 years) and 70 females (54 ± 21 years), separated into groups according to age. The RMS was obtained with an <b>aneroid</b> vacuum <b>manometer</b> (± 300 cmH 2 O). RESULTS: There was {{a significant reduction in}} RMS with increasing age (ANOVA one-way, p< 0. 05). Moreover, the RMS values decreased significantly from age 40 compared to the predicted values (Student t test, p< 0. 05). There were also significant correlations of RMS with age, weight and height (Pearson correlation, p< 0. 05). The predictive equations using linear regression for maximal respiratory pressures according to sex showed that age in males and females and weight in females influenced the prediction of the MIP and MEP values. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that age and anthropometric characteristics influence RMS values. In addition, the RMS values were lower compared to the predicted values from age 40 because the sample was composed exclusively of sedentary individuals. In this context, we propose equations to predict the MIP and MEP values exclusively for healthy, sedentary individuals from 20 to 89 years of age...|$|R
40|$|In {{pediatric}} age {{diagnosis of}} hypertension is defined using a statistical criterion, the limit being the 95 th percentile {{of the distribution}} of the blood pressure values, according to gender, age and height [1]. Pre-hypertension is defined as blood pressure (BP) values consistently above or equal to the 90 th percentile, but lower than the 95 th [Table 1]. The “gold standard” method to measure BP in children is auscultatory, using an <b>aneroid</b> non-mercury <b>manometer</b> (proscribed due to their toxicity). The aneroid devices need to be calibrated every six months. At least three measure-ments performed on different occasions are necessary for the diagnosis of hypertension [2]. Children above 3 years of age should have their blood pressure measured every year. In all children including the youngers ones blood pressure should be measured under special cir-cumstances that increase the risk for hypertension: intensive neonatal care, renal disease, treatment with drugs known to increase blood pressure, evidence of elevated intracranial pressure. The cuff should be of the appropriate size for the children’s upper arm. Small cuffs tend to overestimate while large cuffs underesti-mate. The width of the cuff should be 40 % of the arm circumference at a point midway between the olecra-non and the acromion. The children should be calm and relaxed, seated with their right arm resting at heart level. Systolic blood pressure is defined by the first Korotkoff sound (K 1) whereas diastolic blood pressure coincides with the disappearance of the pulse (K 5).

40|$|We have {{compared}} four tests for assessing airway sealing pressure with the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) {{to test the}} hypothesis that airway sealing pressure and inter-observer reliability differ between tests. We studied 80 paralysed, anaesthetized adult patients. Four different airway sealing pressure tests were performed in random order on each patient by two observers blinded to each other 2 ̆ 7 s measurements: test 1 involved detection of an audible noise; test 2 was detection of end-tidal carbon dioxide in the oral cavity; test 3 was observation of the <b>aneroid</b> <b>manometer</b> dial as the pressure increased to note the airway pressure at which the dial reached stability; and test 4 was detection of an audible noise by neck auscultation. Mean airway sealing pressure ranged from 19. 5 to 21. 3 cm HO and intra-class correlation coefficient was 0. 95 - 0. 99. Inter-observer reliability of all tests was classed as excellent. The manometric stability test had a higher mean airway sealing pressure (P < 0. 0001) and better inter-observer reliability (P < 0. 0001) compared with the three other tests.

Both eyes of 10 adult horses and cattle were evaluated in a postmortem study. The eyes from 10 clinically normal adult horses and cattle were also examined after bilateral auriculopalpebral nerve block and topical anesthesia for an in vivo study. IOP was measured postmortem using direct manometry (measured with an <b>aneroid</b> <b>manometer)</b> and tonometry (measured with a Perkins handheld applanation tonometer). The correlation coefficients (r 2) for the data from the postmortem manometry and Perkins tonometer study were 0. 866 for horses and 0. 864 for cattle. In the in vivo study, IOP in horses was 25. 1 ± 2. 9 mmHg (range 19. 0 ~ 30. 0 mmHg) as measured by manometry and 23. 4 ± 3. 2 mmHg (range 18. 6 ~ 28. 4 mmHg) according to tonometry. In cattle, IOP was found to be 19. 7 ± 1. 2 mmHg (range 18. 0 ~ 22. 0 mmHg) by manometry and 18. 8 ± 1. 7 mmHg (range 15. 9 ~ 20. 8 mmHg) by tonometry.

40|$|Some of the {{different}} factors that can influence the measurement of blood pressure are discussed. It is essential that those engaged {{in the care of}} patients with high blood pressure should standardize the measurement of blood pressure so that the established routine is followed at each attendance. This is especi-ally important today because so many people perform blood pressure checks. It is important to use the correct cuff and mano-meter. When considering costs, one should remember that the measurement of blood pressure is an inexpen-sive examination, but that poor equipment will prove costly both for the patient and for the community medical programme. THE measurement of blood pressure has been one of our most common and most important routine diag-nostic tests formany decades. Often this measurement constitutes the only study upon which long-term treatment is based. Thus, for the patient, the blood pressure estimation may have far-reaching medical and social consequences. It is therefore essential that the blood pressure is measured correctly. From {{the point of view of}} cost, the measurement of blood pressure is inexpensive. A mercury mano-meter equipped with a blood-pressure cuff (Riva-Rocci sphygmomanometer) costs less than £ 23. An <b>aneroid</b> <b>manometer</b> with a blood-pressure cuff costs about £ 7, whereas a blood-pressure cuff alone costs less than £ 2. At the Department of Internal Medicine at the University Hospital of Lund, about 1500 blood-pressure measurements are made in each con-sultation room annually. If the lifetime of a mercury manometer is 10 years, and three cuffs are worn out during this period, the price for each blood pressure determination will be about 0 - 2 p.

Methods: A total of 100 adult patients were observed according to the syringe size used Group- 1 (10 ml) and Group- 2 (20 ml) for ETT cuff inflation in general anesthesia. Patients with anticipated difficult intubation, risk for aspiration, known anatomical laryngotracheal abnormalities, and emergency cases were excluded. Trachea was intubated with size 8 or 8. 5 mm and 7. 0 or 7. 5 mm ETT in male and female patients respectively. The ETT cuff was inflated with air by one of the anesthesia technician. Cuff pressures were measured using <b>aneroid</b> <b>manometer.</b> ETT cuff pressure of 20 – 30 cm of water was considered as standard. Results: In 69 % of the patients, the cuff pressure measurements were above the standard. Age (P = 0. 806), weight (P = 0. 527), height (P = 0. 850), and gender (P = 1. 00) were comparable in both groups.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the use of the Kowa HA- 2 applanation tonometer in measuring intraocular pressure (IOP) in dogs. Twenty eyes were used in an ex vivo study in which the calibration curve for manometry vs. tonometry was determined by artificially raising the IOP in 5 mmHg increments up to 60 mmHg (10 - 60 mmHg). Both eyes of 10 anesthetized dogs were studied in vivo to compare manometry vs. tonometry. In the ambulatory study, 168 healthy eyes, 74 eyes with glaucoma and 60 eyes with uveitis were evaluated by tonometry, which was performed with topical anesthesia and 1 % fluorescein eye drops for the formation of fluorescein semicircles. The ex vivo study showed an excellent correlation coefficient (r 2 = 0. 993) between the <b>aneroid</b> <b>manometer</b> and the Kowa HA- 2 tonometer. In the in vivo study, there was no significant difference (P> 0. 05) between the IOP values by manometry and tonometry, showing the excellent accuracy of the Kowa HA- 2 tonometer. In the ambulatory study using the Kowa HA- 2 tonometer, the IOP values (mean±SD, in mmHg) were 15. 1 ± 1. 8 (12. 0 – 20. 0) for the healthy eyes, 25. 2 ± 4. 0 (20. 0 – 38. 0) for glaucomatous eyes and 10. 1 ± 2. 3 (5. 0 – 13. 7) for eyes with uveitis.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Blood {{pressure}} measurements frequently guide management in critical care. Direct readings, commonly {{from a major}} artery, {{are considered to be}} the gold standard. Because arterial cannulation is associated with risks, alternative noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurements are routinely used. However, the accuracy of NIBP determinations in overweight patients in the outpatient setting is variable, and little is known about critically ill patients. This prospective, observational study was performed to compare direct intra-arterial blood pressure (IABP) with NIBP measurements obtained using auscultatory and oscillometric methods in overweight patients admitted to our medical intensive care unit. Method Adult critically ill patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m 2 or greater and a functional arterial line (assessed using the rapid flush test) were enrolled in the study. IABP measurements were compared with those obtained noninvasively. A calibrated <b>aneroid</b> <b>manometer</b> (auscultatory technique) with arm cuffs compatible with arm sizes and a NIBP monitor (oscillometric technique) were used for NIBP measurements. Agreement between methods was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis. Results Fifty-four patients (23 males) with a mean (± standard error) age of 57 ± 3 years were studied. The mean BMI was 34. 0 ± 1. 4 kg/m 2. Mean arm circumference was 32 ± 0. 6 cm. IABP readings were obtained from the radial artery in all patients. Only eight patients were receiving vasoactive medications. Mean overall biases for the auscultatory and oscillometric techniques were 4. 1 ± 1. 9 and - 8. 0 ± 1. 7 mmHg, respectively (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001), with wide limits of agreement. The overestimation of blood pressure using the auscultatory technique was more important in patients with a BMI of 30 kg/m 2 or greater. In hypertensive patients both NIBP methods underestimated blood pressure as determined using direct IABP measurement. Conclusion Oscillometric blood {{pressure measurements}} underestimated IABP readings regardless of patient BMI. Auscultatory measurements were also inaccurate, tending to underestimate systolic blood pressure and overestimate mean arterial and diastolic blood pressure. NIBP can be inaccurate among overweight critically ill patients and lead to erroneous interpretations of blood pressure...|$|E

A nasofaringoscopia com a manobra de Muller (MM) é utilizada rotineiramente na avaliação pré-operatória destes pacientes para diagnóstico do sítio da obstrução retropalatal (RP) e retrolingual (RL) e planejamento terapêutico, porém existem controvérsias a respeito de seus benefícios. Os estudos que mostram sensibilidade do sono induzido (SI) neste sentido utilizaram métodos subjetivos de avaliação e doses não controladas do indutor do sono. Objetivos: O {{principal}} objetivo do estudo foi comparar o colapso da faringe observado pelos dois métodos diagnósticos, a MM e o SI, através da análise quantitativa da obstrução documentada pela vídeo-nasofaringoscopia, e estudar as correlações deste colapso com o índice de apnéia-hipopnéia (IAH) e a SaO 2 mínina noturna. Métodos: Foram estudados prospectivamente 24 pacientes com SAHOS (IAH > 10) e 15 controles saudáveis (IAH 10) and 15 controls (AHI< 5), {{identified by}} nocturnal PSG, using video-nasopharyngoscopy with MM and IS. An Olympus-video-bronchoscope with 2. 0 mm channel was {{used during the}} procedure. All patients were supine with the head in neutral position. The negative pharyngeal pressure was measured during MM by an <b>aneroid</b> <b>manometer</b> connected to the bronchoscope channel. Low dose and slow infusion of midazolam was necessary to IS and the dosage was controlled by PSG in real time during the procedure. The images of the airway obstruction were captured and analyzed by computed software. Variations between cross sectional areas, lateral dimension and antero-posterior dimension of the RP and RG pharynx during MM and IS was analyzed by OSIRIS program (Osiris Medical Imaging Software - University Hospital of Geneva). Results: {{the collapse of the}} pharynx was greater in OSAHS than in controls during IS. Retropalatal obstruction was similar between the two methods. In contrast, RG collapse was significantly lower during MM than IS. This study has also shown that RG collapse during IS correlated to AHI and nocturnal SaO 2. The total dose of midazolam was lower in OSAHS patients than in controls. Conclusion: Video-nasopharyngoscopy with IS is better than MM in understanding the functional site of pharyngeal obstruction when performed by a controlled technique and quantitative analysis.
