50|$|An {{abrasive}} saw, {{also known}} as a cut-off saw or chop saw, is a power tool which is typically used to cut hard materials, such as metals, tile, and concrete. The cutting action is performed by an <b>abrasive</b> <b>disc,</b> similar to a thin grinding wheel. Technically speaking this is not a saw, as it does not use regularly shaped edges (teeth) for cutting.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} master {{thesis is}} {{an analysis of}} several factors that influence the performance of <b>abrasive</b> cutting <b>discs.</b> It {{has been done in}} collaboration {{with one of the most}} important companies worldwide in the construction tool industry. To keep the confidentiality of this company, this study will refer to it under the name HAG. Contrary to other tools, the performance of <b>abrasive</b> cutting <b>discs</b> is extremely variable depending on many different factors. These multiple factors are extremely diverse and can vary from storage conditions to tool usage. Therefore, this study is developed to obtain precise knowledge on these influential factors so that HAG can take advantage of their direct sales force to access their customers and train the users on how to maximize the performance of their HAG <b>abrasive</b> <b>discs.</b> Based on the available literature and interviews with experts in abrasives manufacturing and testing, this study provides a technical overview on <b>abrasive</b> <b>discs</b> properties, their manufacturing and the grinding process itself. Furthermore, it accurately identifies the most relevant influential factors on the performance of <b>abrasive</b> <b>discs</b> and specific tests are performed to quantify their impact. The mentioned tests provide solid results that have endowed HAG with a profound technical understanding about this sourced product. It has also enabled them to draw precise recommendations on key aspects to optimize the performance of HAG <b>abrasive</b> <b>discs</b> that sales representatives should use as selling arguments. This would not only increase the value of the discs but would also endow HAG salespeople with the image of product experts. The impact of the conclusions extracted from this study is highly interesting for HAG since the deep product knowledge provided will allow customers to use their discs more efficiently and this will, most certainly, imply an increase on the sales of <b>abrasive</b> <b>discs</b> at no additional cost...|$|R
50|$|A wall chaser is a {{specialised}} {{power tool}} used for cutting narrow grooves in walls, for instance when laying electrical cable.

50|$|The {{difficulty}} with these engines {{is in their}} manufacture. The overall shape of the crankshaft and its webs is not a problem, but finishing the bearing surfaces by grinding is. There is no longer access for the large <b>abrasive</b> <b>discs</b> of a crankshaft grinder to reach each bearing, the offset crankshaft webs now being in the way. As a result, each bearing must be made and finish-ground individually; then assembled into a built-up crankshaft, usually by shrink-fitting.|$|R
50|$|A {{circular}} saw is a power-saw using a toothed or <b>abrasive</b> <b>disc</b> or blade to cut different materials using {{a rotary motion}} spinning around an arbor. A hole saw and ring saw also use a rotary motion but are different from a {{circular saw}}. Circular saws may also be loosely used for the blade itself. Circular saws were invented in the late 18th century and were in common use in sawmills in the United States {{by the middle of}} the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|Angle {{grinders}} can be {{powered by}} an electric motor, petrol engine or compressed air. The motor drives a geared head at a right-angle on which is mounted an <b>abrasive</b> <b>disc</b> or a thinner cut-off disc, either {{of which can}} be replaced when worn. Angle grinders typically have an adjustable guard and a side-handle for two-handed operation. Certain angle grinders, depending on their speed range, can be used as sanders, employing a sanding disc with a backing pad or disc. The backing system is typically made of hard plastic, phenolic resin, or medium-hard rubber depending on the amount of flexibility desired.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess - using {{scanning}} electron microscopy (SEM) - the effectiveness of two <b>abrasive</b> <b>discs,</b> one made from silicon and one from aluminum oxide, in removing adhesive remnants (AR) after debonding orthodontic brackets. METHODS: Ten randomly selected bovine teeth were used, i. e., 2 in the control group, and the other 8 divided into two groups, which had orthodontic brackets bonded to their surface with Concise Orthodontic Adhesive (3 M). The following methods were employed - in one single step - to remove AR after debracketing: Group A, Optimize discs (TDV) and Group B, Onegloss discs (Shofu), used at low speed. After removing the AR with the aforementioned methods, the teeth were prepared to undergo SEM analysis, and photographs were taken of the enamel surface with 50 x magnification. Six examiners evaluated the photographs applying the Zachrisson and Årtun enamel surface index (ESI) system (1979). RESULTS: Group A exhibited minor scratches on the enamel surface as well as some AR in some of the photographs, while Group B showed a smoother surface, little or no AR and some abrasion marks in the photographs. No statistically significant differences were found between the two methods and the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The two <b>abrasive</b> <b>discs</b> were effective in removing the AR after bracket debonding in one single step...|$|R

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of a desensitizing agent on microleakage of Class V cavities. Material and Methods: 72 premolar teeth were used. There were 6 groups. Class V restorations were prepared with two different restorative materials (Equia fil, GC, America and Grandio, VOCO, Germany) and two adhesive systems (Clearfil SE Bond, Kuraray, Japan and S 3 Bond Plus, Kuraray, Japan) with and without desensitizing agent (Gluma Desensitizer, Heraeus Kulzer, Germany). Restorations were polished with aluminum oxide <b>abrasive</b> <b>discs.</b> Then a range of 5 - 55 C thermocycling was performed 10. 000 times. The microleakage of restorations was examined with dye penetration method (Basic fuchsine).

40|$|The cutting {{wedge of}} disk shaver at gear shaving has not fully {{satisfactory}} geometry: clearance The cutting wedge {{of the disk}} shaver when gear shaving is not fully geometrically satisfactory. The clearance on cutting edges are practically equal to zero. We would suggest {{this is the reason}} that the disk shavers machining of gear-wheels with large allowance is not possible. The construction of a worm-type tool is known also for clean machining of points of involute of gear-wheels made with continuous spiral cutting edges. The difference of this construction from the construction of N. Chemborisov is that a cutting wedge has the structurally made clearance α (Authors: N. Smorkalov, V. Skripin, V. Ptitcin, IU. Belugin). Polishing of side of coil is the most responsible and labor intensive operation when making a worm-type tool with the continuous spiral cutting edges of construction of N. Smorkalov and other. Dependences allowing to define the coordinates of key points of axial section of side of coil of the worm-type tool were obtained.

40|$|The {{abrasive}} wear resistance of {{white cast iron}} was studied. The iron was solidified using two solidification rates of 1. 5 and 15 degrees C/s. Mass loss was evaluated with tests of the type pin on <b>abrasive</b> <b>disc</b> using alumina of different sizes. Two matrices were tested: one predominantly austenitic and the other predominantly martensitic, containing M(3) C carbides. Samples with cooling rate of 15 degrees C/s showed higher hardness and more refined microstructure compared with those solidified at 1. 5 degrees C/s. During the test, the movement of successive abrasives {{gave rise to the}} strain hardening of the austenite phase, leading to the attainment of similar levels of surface hardness, which explains why the wear rate showed no difference compared to the austenite samples with different solidification rates. For the austenitic matrix the wear rate seems to depend on the hardness of the worn surface and not on the hardness of the material without deformation. The austenitic samples showed cracking and fracture of M(3) C carbides. For the predominantly martensitic matrix, the wear rate was higher at the solidification rate of 1. 5 degrees C/s, for grain size of 66 and 93 mu m. Higher abrasive sizes were found to produce greater penetration and strain hardening of austenitic matrices. However, martensitic iron produces more microcutting, increasing the wear rate of the material. The analysis of the worn surface by scanning electron microscopy indicated {{abrasive wear}} mechanisms such as: microcutting, microfatigue and microploughing. Yet, for the iron of austenitic matrix, the microploughing mechanism was more severe. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

During Fluorox run FBR- 22, 90. 4 % of the theoretical amount of UF/sub 6 / formed was collected in cold traps and chemical traps. Toroid tests of flame calcined mixed Th-U oxide showed low corrosion rates, small changes in particle size and a low solubilization of uranium, while denitration of uranyl nitrate in a fluidized bed resulted in particle growth with uniform layers of uranium oxide. A half-time of 30 min for uranium anion exchange was measured in differential bed studies of uranium sorption on Dowex 21 K. The Darex Reference flowsheet operation resulted in chloride removal to less than 50 ppm in solvent extraction feed from APPR head- end treatment. Unirradiated prototype Consolidated Edison pins were dejacketed with 6 M H/sub 2 /SO/sub 4 / with uranium losses to the dejacketing solution of approximately 0. 2 %. An optimum procedure was developed for clarifying large batches of solvent extraction feed by sand bed filtration. Sheared sections of stainless steel clad UO/sub 2 / were completely leached in onehalf the time required for equal lengths of stainless tubes containing uncrushed pellets. <b>Abrasive</b> <b>disc</b> wheel to metal removal ratios were measured at cutting rates from 10 to 60 in. /min. Dissolution of Zircaloy- 2 dummy fuel elements in an INOR- 8 dissolver with the NaF-LiF salt system resulted in vessel wall corrosion rates of 1 - 2 mils/run (approximately 8 hr of HF exposure).

40|$|Background: In vitro {{staining}} methods {{expose the}} entire specimen to staining solutions. In a real clinical situation, {{this is not}} observed, since one should consider that the bonded surface is not exposed to the oral environment. Theoretically, the clinical condition {{would be the best}} simulated if the specimens were exposed to staining solutions by partial immersion. Aims: To evaluate if different immersion methods and surface treatments influence the color stability of resin-based specimens. Methodology: A stainless steel matrix was used to prepare 30 disc-shaped specimens that were randomly allocated in three groups: Without polishing, polishing with <b>abrasive</b> <b>discs,</b> and surface sealant. Half of the specimens were isolated to maintain only the upper surface exposed to staining (partial immersion) and the other half was totally immersed in coffee solution for 48 h (total immersion). The coordinates ΔE*, ΔL*, Δa*, Δb* were assessed by spectrophotometer. Statistical Analysis: Two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc tests (α = 0. 05). Results: Specimens submitted to partial immersion showed lower values of ΔE*, ΔL*, Δa*, Δb*, in comparison to total immersion (P = 0. 000). Specimens covered by a surface sealant presented lower ΔE* values regardless of the immersion method. Conclusions: Specimens totally immersed in staining solutions could in somehow overestimate the color change, once that in most clinical conditions not all of the restoration surfaces are exposed to the oral environment. Moreover, as the surface sealant application produces color change values that are clinically acceptable, it might be used in esthetic restorations as an adjunct treatment...|$|R

40|$|There is no {{such thing}} as a {{standard}} technique for composite finishing and polishing. Many methods can create a high-shine polish. Composite surfaces are finished and polished to improve their esthetic quality and to protect them against the aggressive oral environment and colonization by microorganisms. Patients want their restorations to feel smooth against their tongues and to have a pleasing appearance. Excess composite can be removed with scalpels, scalers, or <b>abrasive</b> stones and <b>discs.</b> Interproximal areas can be treated with interdental strips or oscillating systems with diamond-coated inserts. Normally, dentists also use rotary instruments. Suitable types of carbide finishers have a clear advantage over fine-grit diamond burs in this step: they work selectively, which means they “differentiate ” between soft composite and hard enamel and thus help to conserve the natural tooth structure. In contrast to diamonds, carbide finishers perform a cutting, rather than grinding, action: ie, they remove material in the form of chips. The hardened metal blades act by means of plastic de-formation of the substrate and deformation-associated shear forces occurring between blades and surface. 1 As a result, car-bide finishers with a sufficient number of blades (20, 30, or 40) produce smoother surfaces than diamond finishers. Surprisingly, the roughness values may be better than those obtained by the use of aluminum oxide-coated polishing discs, which are fre-quently regarded as the standard tools for composite polishing. 2 SUITABLE AND UNSUITABLE FINISHERS However, not all carbide finishers are equally suitable. Working parts with nonrounded angles may damage composite and, in particular,enamel surfaces. 3 This disadvantage applies to burs wit...|$|R
