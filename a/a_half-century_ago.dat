40|$|Isotope {{dilution}} is {{a well-known}} primary ratio method of quantitative analysis that yields good-quality metrological results. Many equations have been proposed to calculate the amount of substance from the isotope ratio measurements, and these have been used successfully for more than <b>a</b> <b>half-century.</b> Decades <b>ago,</b> isotope dilution equations were extended to correct for analyte formation during analysis, which is especially apparent {{in the analysis of}} methylmercury or chromium(VI). Considering only methods for the determination of these two analytes, many variables that are involved must be considered (for example, the extent of analyte formation, the number of isotopes monitored for each analyte, the number of substances, or the nature of mass spectra (elemental versus molecular)). To date, no master equation that can adequately address all of these aspects of the problem has been proposed. In this manuscript, we propose a general equation for isotope dilution.

They continued the habit of being Democrats, just as they continued the habit of wearing fuzzy old plug hats, of old-fashioned shapes, and long, polished frock coats. Then there were a few of that perpetually cross-grained class who will never agree with anybody else if they can help it. They belonged to the Democracy because the Democrats were in the minority, and considered it wrong to belong to a majority, anyhow. Of this sort were men like Colonel Peavy and old Judd Colwell.|$|E
60|$|His {{experience}} in {{laying the groundwork}} for his history, and his researches in making it thorough, were such as to have liberated him to the knowledge of other manners and ideals, but he remained strictly a Bostonian, and as immutably of the Boston social and literary faith as any I knew in that capital of accomplished facts. He had lived like an Indian among the wild Western tribes; he consorted with the Canadian archaeologists in their mousings among the colonial archives of their fallen state; every year he went to Quebec or Paris to study the history of New France in the original documents; European society was open to him everywhere; but he had those limitations which I nearly always found in the Boston men, I remember his talking to me of 'The Rise of Silas Lapham', in a somewhat troubled and uncertain strain, and interpreting his rise as the achievement of social recognition, without much or at all liking it or me for it. I did not think it my part to point out that I had supposed the rise to be a moral one; and later I fell under his condemnation for certain high crimes and misdemeanors I had been guilty of against a well-known ideal in fiction. These in fact constituted lese-majesty of romanticism, which seemed to be disproportionately dear to a man who was in his own way trying to tell the truth of human nature as I was in mine. His displeasures passed, however, and my last meeting with our greatest historian, as I think him, was of unalloyed friendliness. He came to me during my final year in Boston for nothing apparently but to tell me of his liking for a book of mine describing boy-life in Southern Ohio <b>a</b> <b>half-century</b> <b>ago.</b> He wished to talk about many points of this, which he found the same as his own boylife in the neighborhood of Boston; and we could agree that the life of the Anglo- Saxon boy was pretty much the same everywhere. He had helped himself into my apartment with a crutch, but I do not remember how he had fallen lame. It was the end of his long walks, I believe, and not long afterwards I had the grief to read of his death. I noticed that perhaps through his enforced quiet, he had put on weight; his fine face was full; whereas when I first knew him he was almost delicately thin of figure and feature. He was always of a distinguished presence, and his face had a great distinction.|$|E

50|$|In these camp-meeting gatherings, social cordiality was {{blended with}} {{religious}} zeal. Fervor along religious lines was more intense and demonstrative <b>a</b> <b>half-century</b> <b>ago</b> {{than it is}} today. A man was expected to shout to show his zeal and attest his spirituality.

Thus the meetings seldom got far advanced before men and women were praying, groaning and singing together. Some were groaning on account of their sins, some praying for their companions, others singing and shouting because they felt happy, and a few would swoon from physical exhaustion.|$|E

Neither of Bonwich's sources at Kraft and Roma had a definitive answer for the origin of the name, although one popular theory {{is that it is a}} portmanteau of the words provolone and mozzarella, two of the cheeses for which it is substituted. Another rumored name origin is that [...] "Provel" [...] comes from the name provolone, removing the [...] "-one" [...] as it is made up of more than one type of cheese.|$|E
5000|$|Deitch's shorts were {{commercial}} successes. In 1961, the Tom and Jerry series {{became the}} highest-grossing animated short film series of that time, dethroning Looney Tunes, which {{had held the}} position for sixteen years; this success was repeated once more in 1962. However, unlike the Hanna-Barbera shorts, none of Deitch's films were nominated for nor did they win an Academy Award. In retrospect, these shorts are often considered {{the worst of the}} Tom and Jerry theatrical output. Deitch stated that due to his team's inexperience as well as their low budget, he [...] "hardly had a chance to succeed", and [...] "well understands the negative reactions" [...] to his shorts. He believes [...] "They could all have been better animated - truer to the characters - but our T&Js were produced in the early 1960s, near the beginning of my presence here, over <b>a</b> <b>half-century</b> <b>ago</b> as I write this!" [...] Despite the criticism, some fans wrote positive letters to Deitch, stating that his Tom and Jerry shorts were their personal favorites due to their quirky and surreal nature.
