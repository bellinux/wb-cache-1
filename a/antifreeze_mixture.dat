50|$|Unfortunately, {{the great}} {{expense of the}} {{aluminum}} engine led to its cancellation after the 1963 model year.

40|$|The {{ability to}} predict the {{short-term}} behavior of ground loop heat exchangers (GLHE) {{is critical to the}} design and energy analysis of ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems. Thermal load profiles vary significantly from building to building – GLHE designs can be dominated by long-term heat build-up or short-term peak loads. In some extreme cases, where the GLHE design is dominated by short-term peak loads, temperatures in the GLHE can rise rapidly; say 5 - 10 ºC in one to two hours. For such short-term peak loads, the thermal mass of the fluid can significantly dampen the temperature response of the ground loop. The over prediction of the temperature rise (or fall) in turn can cause an over prediction of the required GLHE length. Furthermore, the temperature response can be damped by the fluid {{in the rest of the}} system, in addition to the fluid in the borehole. The temperature response also has a secondary impact on the predicted energy consumption of the system, as the COP of the heat pump varies with entering fluid temperature. Therefore, it is desirable to be able to model the short-term behavior accurately. In GSHP systems, <b>antifreeze</b> <b>mixtures</b> are often used as a heat transfer fluid. Generally, the flow rate in the GLHE is designed so as to ensure turbulent flow in the tube to guarantee a low convective heat transfer resistance. However, for some antifreeze types, the large increase in viscosity as the temperature decreases may result in transition to laminar flow, or require an otherwise unnecessarily high system flow rate. For example, at 20 ºC, the viscosity of 20 % weight concentration propylene glycol is 0. 0022 Pa. s and the density is 1021 kg/m 3. At – 5 ºC, th...|$|R
40|$|If {{the minimum}} {{anticipated}} fluid temperature in a ground source {{heat pump system}} falls near or below 0 oC, an <b>antifreeze</b> <b>mixture</b> must be used to prevent freezing in the heat pump. The <b>antifreeze</b> <b>mixture</b> type and concentration has a number of implications for the design and performance of the system. These include the required ground loop heat exchanger length, the capacity and energy consumption of the heat pump, the circulating pump selection, pumping energy, and the first cost of the system. For example, the required ground loop heat exchanger length and first cost will decrease, due to lower permissible operating temperatures, with increasing antifreeze concentration in heating-dominated climates. On the other hand, the antifreeze also degrades the heat pump performance; operating costs can be expected to increase with increasing antifreeze concentration, and a larger capacity heat pump may be needed. The complex interaction between all of the design variables makes it difficult to choose an optimal design, and it is desirable to have a simulation and life cycle cost analysis {{that can be used to}} evaluate all of the variable interactions, to be used as the basis for an optimal design procedure.

40|$|Umiat {{oil field}} {{is a light}} oil in a shallow, frozen {{reservoir}} in the Brooks Range foothills of northern Alaska with estimated oil-in-place of over 1 billion barrels. Umiat field was discovered in the 1940 ’s but was never considered viable because it is shallow, in the permafrost, and far from any transportation infrastructure. The advent of modern drilling and production techniques has made Umiat and similar fields in northern Alaska attractive exploration and production targets. Since 2008 UAF {{has been working with}} Renaissance Alaska Inc. and, more recently, Linc Energy, to develop a more robust reservoir model that can be combined with rock and fluid property data to simulate potential production techniques. This work will be used to by Linc Energy as they prepare to drill up to 5 horizontal wells during the 2012 - 2013 drilling season. This new work identified three potential reservoir horizons within the Cretaceous Nanushuk Formation: the Upper and Lower Grandstand sands, and the overlying Ninuluk sand, with the Lower Grandstand considered the primary target. Seals are provided by thick interlayered shales. Reserve estimates for the Lower Grandstand alone range from 739 million barrels to 2437 million barrels, with an average of 1527 million bbls. Reservoir simulations predict that cold gas injection from a wagon-wheel pattern of multilateral injectors and producers located on 5 drill sites on the crest of the structure will yield 12 - 15 % recovery, with actual recovery depending upon the injection pressure used, the actual Kv/Kh encountered, and other geologic factors. Key to understanding the flow behavior of the Umiat reservoir is determining the permeability structure of the sands. Sandstones of the Cretaceous Nanushuk Formation consist of mixed shoreface and deltaic sandstones and mudstones. A core-based study of the sedimentary facies of these sands combined with outcrop observations identified six distinct facies associations with distinctive permeability trends. The Lower Grandstand sand consists of two coarsening-upward shoreface sands sequences while the Upper Grandstand consists of a single coarsening-upward shoreface sand. Each of the shoreface sands shows a distinctive permeability profile with high horizontal permeability at the top getting progressively poorer towards the base of the sand. In contrast, deltaic sandstones in the overlying Ninuluk are more permeable {{at the base of the}} sands, with decreasing permeability towards the sand top. These trends impart a strong permeability anisotropy to the reservoir and are being incorporated into the reservoir model. These observations also suggest that horizontal wells should target the upper part of the major sands. Natural fractures may superimpose another permeability pattern on the Umiat reservoir that need to be accounted for in both the simulation and in drilling. Examination of legacy core from Umiat field indicate that fractures are present in the subsurface, but don't provide information on their orientation and density. Nearby surface exposures of folds in similar stratigraphy indicate there are at least three possible fracture sets: an early, N/S striking set that may predate folding and two sets possibly related to folding: an EW striking set of extension fractures that are parallel to the fold axes and a set of conjugate shear fractures oriented NE and NW. Analysis of fracture spacing suggests that these natural fractures are fairly widely spaced (25 - 59 cm depending upon the fracture set), but could provide improved reservoir permeability in horizontal legs drilled perpendicular to the open fracture set. The phase behavior of the Umiat fluid needed to be well understood in order for the reservoir simulation to be accurate. However, only a small amount of Umiat oil was available; this oil was collected in the 1940 ’s and was severely weathered. The composition of this ‘dead’ Umiat fluid was characterized by gas chromatography. This analysis was then compared to theoretical Umiat composition derived using the Pedersen method with original Umiat fluid properties published in the original reports. This comparison allowed estimation of the ‘lost’ light hydrocarbon fractions. An Umiat 'dead' oil sample then could be physically created by adding the lost light ends to the weatherized Umiat dead oil sample. This recreated sample was recombined with solution gas to create a 'pseudo-live' Umiat oil sample which was then used for experimental PVT and phase behavior studies to determine fluid properties over the range of reservoir pressures and temperatures. The phase behavior of the ‘pseudo-live’ oil was also simulated using the Peng- Robinson equations of state (EOS). The EOS model was tuned with measured experimental data to accurately simulate the differential liberation tests in order to obtain the necessary data for reservoir simulation studies, including bubble point pressure and oil viscosity. The bubble point pressure of the reconstructed Umiat oil is 345 psi, suggesting that maintenance of reservoir pressures above that pressure will be important for the any proposed production technique. A major part of predicting how the Umiat reservoir will perform is determining the relative permeability of oil in the presence of ice. Early in the project, UAF work on samples of the Umiat reservoir indicated that there is a significant reduction in the relatively permeability of oil in the presence of ice. However, it was not clear as to why this reduction occurred or where the ice resided. To explore this further, additional experimental and theoretical work was conducted. Core flood experiments were performed on two clean Berea sandstone cores under permafrost conditions to determine the relative permeability to oil (kro) over a temperature range of 23 ºC to - 10 ºC and for a range of connate water salinities. Both cores showed maximum reduction in relative permeability to oil when saturated with deionized water and less reduction when saturated with saline water. This reduction in relative permeability can be explained by formation of ice crystals in the center of pores. Theoretically, the radius of ice formed in the center of the pore can be determined using the Kozeny–Carman Equation by assuming the pores and pore throats as a cube with ‘N’ identical parallel pipes embedded in it. Using the values of kro obtained from the experimental work as input to the Kozeny–Carman Equation at - 10 ºC, the radius of ice crystals dropped from 0. 145 μm to 0. 069 μm when flooding-water salinity is increased to 6467 ppm. This explains the reduction of relative permeability with decreasing salinity but does not take into consideration other effects such as variations in pore throat structure. In addition, fluids like deionized water, saline water, and <b>antifreeze</b> (a <b>mixture</b> of 60 % ethylene or propylene glycol with 40 % water) were tested to find the best flooding agent for frozen reservoirs. At 0 ºC, 9 % greater recovery was observed with antifreeze was used as a flooding agent as compared to using saline water. Antifreeze showed 48 % recovery even at - 10 ºC, at which temperature the rest of the fluids failed to increase production. Preliminary evaluation of drilling fluids indicate that the brine-based muds caused significantly less swelling in the Umiat reservoir sands when compared to fresh-water based muds. However since freezing filtrate is another cause of formation damage, a simple water-based-mud may not a viable option. It is recommended that new fluids be tested, including different salts, brines, polymers and oil-based fluids. These fluids should be tested at low temperatures in order to determine the potential for formation damage, the fluid properties under these conditions and to ensure that the freezing point is below that of the reservoir. In order to reduce the surface footprint while accessing the maximum amount of the Lower Grandstand interval, simulations used development from 5 surface locations with a wagon-wheel pattern of multilateral injectors and producers. There is no active aquifer support due to small peizometric head in the area and no existing gas cap, so an alternative method of pressure support is needed. Cold gas injection was used in the simulations as it is considered the most viable means of providing pressure maintenance while maintaining wellbore stability and reducing impact on the permafrost. Saline water injection may be a viable alternative, though this may have a detrimental effect on permafrost. In the short term, the results of this work are being incorporated into Linc Energy’s drilling and development plan. This project has also provided valuable information on the rock and fluid properties of low temperature reservoirs as well as the efficacy of potential production techniques for Umiat or similar shallow frozen reservoirs in the circum-Arctic...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY In {{this project}} a study {{about the use}} of {{geothermal}} energy for air conditioning of the Colegio Mayor Juan de la Cosa is done. The number of probes required, its position, all the elements required for the installation to extract heat from the subsoil, and the execution thereof are calculated. To this end, all the necessary parameters such as geology, climate, construction site, the energy demands of the building throughout the year, and the number of hours of use of the system will be analyzed. Relevant simulations will be conducted to verify proper operation of the system that will be chosen, and finally, the constructive solution will be defined to comply with these requirements. THEORETICAL CONTEXT The low enthalpy geothermal energy consists of transmiting thermal energy from underground short depth to a building. When a heat input into the building is needed, the use of the system is as heating. Or It is used for cooling when is necessary transport the heat inside the building to the surface layers of the Earth. Geothermal energy of low enthalpy present in anywhere in the world, is a renewable energy, is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, is safe, predictable, measurable, controllable, metered, virtually inexhaustible, present at any point of the terrestrial crust and with very low levels of use in Spain. There are several ways to exploit this energy. Used in this study is a closed system. The implementations of vertical geothermal boreholes are located under the building. LOCATION AND GEOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK The location of the building, on which the study of the use of very low enthalpy geothermal will be performed, is located on the current site located at number 55 (D) of the Avenue of the Castros of the city of Santander (39005). At the North, Avenue Castros, At South, Honduras Street, At West, La Teja park, and at the East, buildings for residential use are available. Geology in this area present for less than 170 m depth would be shown in the following two points: 1. A layer formed by an alternation of marl and marly limestones, with powers of centimeters or decimeters and abundant traces of water leaks. In this first layer the borehole has a depth of about 80 - 90 m from the level of project. 2. A second layer formed predominantly by calcarenitas, with bioclastic and sandy limestones with power decimeter or meter, very regular, and having well-defined surfaces frequently stratification by marly joints. In this second layer the 150 - 170 m depth are achieved from the level of project. STUDY OF ALTERNATIVES To determine the number of probes, depth and configuration of the building, is needed to start knowing the data and machines which have to be installed, and proceeds to simulate the thermal behavior of the subsoil over the years to ensure correct operation of the installation. This calculation is performed by EED 3. 2 software, very common in the design of vertical heat exchangers. A total of 4 simulations are performed, discarding the first because it doesn’t provide the the building energy needs. The second one is made with a single probe type U, it provides us the building energy needed with the minimum requirements of the installation. With the aim of seeking to reduce costs, a third simulation with a probe double U type is simulated, which save us meters of drilling and therefore reduce the final budget. After calculating the third simulation, and checking that effectively meters of drilling are below those of the second drilling, it is found that is capable of meeting the energy demands of the building. It is noted that this third option is very close to the cool limits for the heat transfer fluid, so it was decided to make one last simulation with a slight increase in the depth of the boreholes. Serving more safely to the limits given for the heat transfer fluid. BOREHOLE EXECUTION AND TESTS This first drilling soil type is required, which can be executed by various methods, the method chosen in this study is the rotation with the use of sludge in direct circulation for debris extraction. The casings will be needed at least {{in the first part of}} the boreholes to ensure the sustainability of the land. The introduction of the exchanger (PEX material) will be made once walls of drilling are fitted. It will review the probes lack of scratches caused during transport or during handling. The probes will have dividers that keep apart a given distance the pipes. In the the dividers center will have a hole where will be placed the injection tube. Probes were loaded with the water- <b>antifreeze</b> <b>mixture</b> before they will be introduced in the borehole. This will allow gravity pipe down, taking care to don’t introduce at a rate too high to avoid rubbing the probes with the mouth or the walls of the borehole. It will be introduced manually or with the aid of an unwinding mechanism. Before injection of the filling it is recommended a first pressure test subjecting the exchanger at a pressure of 6 bar for 30 min. If the test succeeds the filling material is injected through injection pipe from the base of the drilling. The filling mixture is made by injection plant. Once cemented the survey, final pressure test is performed according to the UNE 100715 - 1, whose operating scheme is summarized as follows: • The tubes were kept idle without load for at least 1 hour. • The probe is brought to test pressure (12 ± 1 bar) in a time of 10 minutes. • Stays in pressure (at least 10 bar) for 10 minutes. • Waiting Period: 60 minutes. Maximum pressure drop: 30 %. • The pressure is quickly reduced by 2 bar through water drain. the discharged amount is measured and the new pressure value is noted. • Start main test (30 minutes). The pressure is measured at 10, 20 and 30 minutes. The pressure test is satisfactory if, after the third measurement, the maximum pressure drop is 0. 1 bar. • After an additional 90 minutes, the pressure drop should be less than 0. 25 bar. Borehole connection to the heat pumps room is made by HDPE pipes, for it is needed to do a trench with 1 m deep, where a sand bed of 10 cm is placed to prevent scratching HDPE tubes is done. Another layer of sand over the HDPE tubes are placed and the rest is filled with ground own previous excavation. ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY AND FINAL CHOOSE In a first analysis indicates that the alternative Nº 2 is the most expensive because of the large number of underground drilling to be executed mainly. If the budget of the horizontal section is also analyzed it shows that the alternative Nº 2 is also the most expensive. This is because the cubic meters of excavation and pipe meters are higher for the largest number of probes to be executed. Analyzing the cost of vertical soundings noticed this difference because the survey meter drilling is more expensive than the exchanger, then reducing meters of drilling cost savings will be achieved. Therefore, The alternative Nº 2 is 7. 81 % more expensive than the alternative Nº 3 and a 5. 7 % more expensive than the alternative Nº 4. In this order, the alternative Nº 3 may be discarded for economic reasons. The difference between the alternative Nº 3 and alternative Nº 4 is 4346. 5 euros, 1. 9 % of the budget for the alternative Nº 3. It is not a significant economic difference between these two alternatives. But in response to technical reasons the alternative Nº. 4 is willing side of safety, while alternative Nº 3 is more in line with the limit values. Therefore to ensure the proper functioning of the system it decides that the alternative Nº 4, despite a small increase in the budget, is the best alternative with a tender base budget of € 322, 454. 42. RESUMEN: OBJETIVO DEL ESTUDIO En el presente proyecto se realiza un estudio sobre el uso de la energía geotérmica para la climatización del Colegio Mayor Juan de la Cosa, calculando el número de sondeos necesarios, su posición y todos los elementos que requiere la instalación para extraer el calor del subsuelo, así como su ejecución. Para ello se analizarán todos los parámetros necesarios como son la geología, el clima, el emplazamiento de la obra, las demandas energéticas del edificio a lo largo del año, así como el número de horas de utilización del sistema. Se realizarán las simulaciones pertinentes para comprobar el correcto funcionamiento del sistema escogido, y finalmente, se definirá la solución constructiva necesaria para dar cumplimiento a estos requisitos establecidos. CONTEXTO TEÓRICO La energía geotérmica de baja entalpía consiste en trasmitir energía térmica desde el subsuelo a pequeña profundidad a una edificación. Cuando sea necesario un aporte de calor en el edificio usando el sistema como calefacción, o cuando sea necesario refrigerar las estancias se transportará el calor del interior de la edificación a las capas superficiales de la Tierra. La energía geotérmica de baja entalpía, presente en cualquier punto del planeta, es una energía renovable, está disponible las 24 horas del día, 365 días al año, es segura, previsible, medible, controlable, dosificable, prácticamente inagotable, presente en cualquier punto de la corteza terrestre y con muy bajos niveles de utilización en España. Existen diversas formas de aprovechar esta energía. La utilizada en este estudio consiste en un sistema de lazo cerrado con ejecución de sondas geotérmicas verticales situadas debajo del edificio. UBICACIÓN Y MARCO GEOLOGICO El lugar donde se encontrará el edificio sobre el que se realiza el estudio del empleo de la geotermia de muy baja entalpía se ubica en el actual solar situado en el numero 55 (D) de la avenida de los Castros de la ciudad de Santander (39005). Al Norte se dispone la avenida de los Castros, al Sur la calle Honduras, al Oeste el parque municipal de la Teja y al Este un solar con edificaciones de tipología abierta de uso residencial. En esta zona la geología presente para un sondeo menor a 170 m sería la que se muestra en los siguientes dos puntos: 1. Una capa formada por una alternancia de margas y calizas margosas, con potencias de centímetros o decímetros y abundantes huellas de escapes de agua. En el sondeo esta primera capa tiene una profundidad de unos 80 - 90 m desde la cota de proyecto. 2. Una segunda capa formada predominantemente por calcarenitas, junto con calizas bioclásticas y arenosas, con potencia decimétrica o métrica, muy regulares, y que presentan superficies de estratificación muy bien definidas con frecuencia por juntas margosas. En esta segunda capa se alcanzan los 150 - 170 m de profundidad desde la cota de proyecto. ESTUDIO DE ALTERNATIVAS Para determinar el número de sondeos, su profundidad y configuración se parte de los datos de demanda energética del edificio y de la maquinaria a instalar, y se procede a la simulación del comportamiento térmico del subsuelo para asegurar el correcto funcionamiento de la instalación a lo largo de los años. Dicho cálculo se ejecuta mediante el software EED 3. 2, muy habitual en el diseño de intercambiadores verticales. Se realizaron un total de 4 simulaciones, descartando la primera de ellas por no satisfacer las necesidades energéticas del edificio. La segunda simulación, realizada para una sonda tipo simple U cumple con los requerimientos mínimos de la instalación. Sin embargo, con el objetivo de buscar reducir los costes se lleva a cabo una tercera simulación con una sonda tipo doble U, que permita ahorrar metros de perforación y por tanto reduzca el presupuesto final. Una vez calculada esta tercera simulación y comprobando que efectivamente los metros de perforación son menores a los de la segunda, se comprueba que esta es capaz de satisfacer la demanda energética del edificio. Se observa que esta tercera alternativa está muy cerca de los límites impuestos al fluido refrigerante, por lo que se decide realizar una última simulación con un ligero aumento de la profundidad de los sondeos, cumpliendo de forma más segura con los valores límites impuestos al fluido refrigerante. EJECUCIÓN DEL SONDEO Y PRUEBAS Primero es necesaria la perforación de este tipo de suelo, que puede ser ejecutado mediante distintos métodos, siendo la rotación directa con el empleo de lodos en circulación directa para la extracción del detritus la considerada en el estudio. Las entubaciones serán necesarias al menos en la primera parte del sondeo para asegurar el sostenimiento del terreno. La introducción del intercambiador (de material tipo PEX) se realizará una vez la perforación esté acondicionada, de manera que se eviten posibles colapsos de las paredes del sondeo. Se revisará que las sondas carezcan de arañazos ocasionados en el transporte o durante su manipulación. Las sondas dispondrán de separadores que mantengan los tubos separados entre sí una distancia dada, llevando en el centro el registro para colocar el tubo de inyección. Las sondas se introducirán cargadas de la mezcla de agua-anticongelante. Esto permitirá que la tubería baje por gravedad, con la precaución de introducirlas a una velocidad demasiado alta que evite el roce las sondas con la boca o las paredes de la perforación. Se introducirá manualmente o con la ayuda de un mecanismo desenrollador. Antes de la inyección del relleno se recomienda realizar una primera prueba de presión sometiendo al intercambiador a una presión de 6 bar durante 30 minutos. Si la prueba es satisfactoria se inyectará el material de relleno mediante tubería de inyección desde la base de la perforación. La mezcla del relleno se realizará mediante una planta de inyección. Una vez cementado el sondeo, se realiza una prueba de presión definitiva según la norma UNE 100715 - 1, cuyo esquema operativo se resume en lo siguiente: • Se mantienen los tubos en reposo, sin carga durante al menos 1 hora. • Se lleva la sonda a la presión de prueba (12 ± 1 bar) en un tiempo de 10 minutos. • Se mantiene en presión (al menos 10 bar) durante 10 minutos. • Periodo de espera: 60 minutos. Caída de presión máxima: 30 %. • Se reduce la presión rápidamente en 2 bar mediante vaciado de agua. Se mide la cantidad evacuada y se anota el nuevo valor de la presión. • Comienza la prueba principal (30 minutos). Se mide la presión a los 10, 20 y a los 30 minutos. La prueba de presión es satisfactoria si, al cabo de esa tercera medición, la caída de presión máxima es de 0, 1 bar. • Después de un tiempo adicional de 90 minutos, la caída de presión debe ser inferior a 0, 25 bar. La conexión de los sondeos a la sala de máquinas se realiza mediante tubos PEAD. Para ello se realiza la excavación de zanjas de 1 m de profundidad, en las que se coloca una cama de arena de 10 cm para evitar que los tubos PEAD se arañen. Se colocará otra capa de arena encima de los tubos PEAD y el resto se rellenará con la propia tierra de la excavación. VIABILIDAD ECONÓMICA Y ELECCIÓN FINAL En un primer análisis se observa que la alternativa Nº 2 es la más cara debido a la gran cantidad de metro de perforación que se debe ejecutar, principalmente. Si se analiza también el presupuesto del tramo horizontal se observa que la alternativa Nº 2 es también la más cara. Esto es debido a que los metros cúbicos de excavación y los metros de tubería son mayores por el mayor número de sondeos que se deben ejecutar. Analizando el coste de los sondeos verticales se observa esta diferencia debido a que el metro de perforación de sondeo es más caro que el metro de intercambiador, por lo que reduciendo los metros de perforación se conseguirá un ahorro de los costes. Por tanto, puesto que la alternativa Nº 2 es un 7, 81 % más cara que la alternativa Nº 3, y un 5, 7 % más cara que la alternativa Nº 4, puede ser descartada por motivos económicos. La diferencia entre las alternativas Nº 3 y la Nº 4 es de 4346, 5 €, un 1, 9 % del presupuesto de la alternativa Nº 3. Apenas hay diferencia económica significativa entre ambas, pero atendiendo a motivos técnicos la alternativa Nº 4 está dispuesta del lado de la seguridad, mientras que la alternativa Nº 3 está ligeramente más ajustada a los valores límites. Por tanto para asegurar el mejor funcionamiento del sistema diseñado se decide que la alternativa Nº 4 es la alternativa más adecuada con un presupuesto base de licitación de 322. 454, 42 €.
