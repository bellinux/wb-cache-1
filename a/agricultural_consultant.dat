They assist producer decision-making by providing industry intelligence, up-to-date information and analysis of options.

40|$|General {{surveillance}} {{activities have}} an important role in plant biosecurity for the early detection of pests (includes diseases) and for demonstrating area freedom. Currently general surveillance information for the grains industry in Western Australia is mainly collected though reports of suspect high priority pests to the state Department of Agriculture and Food (DAFWA). Little information is available on the likelihood that members of the grains industry would report a suspect high priority pest, where and who they report pests to, and the factors that influence their decisions to report pests. This study details a survey of members of the grains industry conducted to determine the reporting practices relating to plant pest and diseases in the grains industry. Results of the study indicate that growers preferentially report to <b>agricultural</b> <b>consultants</b> and the local DAFWA staff; whereas <b>agricultural</b> <b>consultants</b> and researchers are more likely to report to the DAFWA head office. Factors that influenced participants' reporting of suspect high priority pests included the ability to eradicate the pest or disease, free examination of suspect samples and the desire for more information about high priority pests.

40|$|Objective To {{document}} the personal, educational and professional skills that characterise veterinarians pursuing careers as <b>agricultural</b> <b>consultants</b> {{and to determine}} the future direction for veterinary-related advisory services to agriculture in Australia. Design Thirty-six veterinarians practising as consultants in agriculture throughout Australia were sent a postal survey in 1994. Procedure A descriptive analysis was chosen because of the relatively small population available to sample. Comparisons were made on a percentage basis where appropriate. Results Twenty-four useable responses to the questionnaire were received. Consultants were mostly men with an agricultural background, aged 31 to 40 years. They considered their undergraduate veterinary studies to be a stepping stone into further education and practical experience and ultimately consultancy. Consultants predicted an increased reliance for their work on corporate farms, private agribusiness, {{research and development and}} sub-contracted work, rather than on family-owned farms. Consultants disagreed on the wisdom of combining consultancy activities with alternative businesses (for instance mixed veterinary practice). Only 13 consultants derived greater than 76...|$|R
