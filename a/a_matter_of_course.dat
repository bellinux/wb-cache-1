5|$|Death Valley is {{the hottest}} and driest place in North America due to its lack of surface water and low relief. It is so {{frequently}} the hottest spot in the United States that many tabulations of the highest daily temperatures in the country omit Death Valley as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course.</b>|$|E
5|$|Equal {{franchise}} {{was eventually}} won {{with the passing}} of the Representation of the People Act 1928. This was not achieved through <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> but through a constant campaign of organised pressure. The NUWSS reorganised into the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (NUSEC), taking on a broader range of issues to secure more widespread support.|$|E
5|$|When the War of the Austrian Succession started, Winterfeldt {{was sent}} {{on a mission}} to St. Petersburg, which, however, failed. He then {{commanded}} a grenadier battalion with great distinction at the Battle of Mollwitz, and won further glory in the celebrated minor combat of Rothschloss, where the Prussian hussars defeated the Austrians on 17 May 1741. One month later, Winterfeldt was made a colonel, as also was Zieten, the cavalry leader who had actually commanded at Rothschloss; the latter, as the older in years and service, resented the rapid promotion of his junior. After this promotion, Frederick chiefly employed Winterfeldt as a confidential staff officer to represent his views to the generals, a position in which Winterfeldt needed extraordinary tact and knowledge of men and affairs, and as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> made many enemies.|$|E

6000|$|After she {{had heard}} Mrs. March to the end even of her repetitions, Miss Vance said, {{as if it were}} <b>a</b> mere <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> that she should have looked the affair up, [...] "Yes, I have seen Mr. Lindau at the hospital--" ...|$|R
25|$|As <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> Gershwin later {{studied with}} the {{classical}} composer Rubin Goldmark and avant-garde composer-theorist Henry Cowell, thus formalizing his classical music training.|$|E
25|$|By the 1990s, {{references}} to bondage {{could be found}} in mainstream prime-time television series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, where equipment such as handcuffs or collars and concepts such as the safeword were included as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the West, {{the idea}} came to the Romans through the lengthy process of cross-fertilization with Hellenistic civilization. Many Roman authors such as Cicero and Pliny refer in their works to the rotundity of the earth as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course.</b>|$|E
6000|$|More {{wonders for}} Malcolm Stewart, who had learnt {{to believe it}} mere dishonour and tameness to forgive the son for his father's deeds. A cloistered priest could hardly do so: pardon to a hostile family came only with the last mortal throe; and here was this warlike king {{forgiving}} as <b>a</b> mere <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course!</b> ...|$|R
60|$|The other episode {{occurred}} last night. Mr. Pike says nothing, yet {{he knows}} the crew situation. I have been watching some time now, ever {{since the death of}} Marinkovich; and I am certain that Mr. Pike never ventures on the main deck after dark. Yet he holds his tongue, confides in no man, and plays out the bitter perilous game as <b>a</b> commonplace <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> and all in the day's work.|$|R
50|$|In reserve duty (or reserve service; שירות מילואים, Sherut Milu'im), Israeli {{residents}} who have completed military service {{are assigned to}} the Israel Defense Forces' military reserve force to provide reinforcements during emergencies (war, military operations or natural disasters), and as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> routine <b>course</b> (e.g. for training, ongoing security and other activities). Some reservists are assigned to the same units they served in during their regular military service, and some are assigned to dedicated reserve units.|$|R
25|$|The entire 70 {{minutes of}} the fatal session, as well as ten hours of other {{sessions}} from the preceding days, had been videotaped as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> with Watkins's treatment. All the videos were shown at the trial of Watkins and Ponder.|$|E

A Royal Australian Navy Officer has been seconded to PNG's National Co-ordination Centre and joint exercises are held regularly to review and strengthen current maritime border surveillance.

25|$|Peled's first direct {{involvement}} in a political party was in 1977 with {{the foundation of the}} short-lived Left Camp of Israel party, whose platform focused on advocating peace negotiations with the Palestinians. Peled, like virtually the entire membership of the ICIPP went into the new party as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> but things did not go as smoothly as may have been expected.|$|E
50|$|This definition, {{together}} with Peirce's definitions of correspondence and determination, {{is sufficient to}} derive all of the statements that are necessarily true for all sign relations. Yet, {{there is much more}} to the theory of signs than simply proving universal theorems about generic sign relations. There is also the task of classifying the various species and subspecies of sign relations. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> practical <b>matter,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> familiarity with the full range of concrete examples is indispensable to theory and application both.|$|R
60|$|On the {{platform}} stood a tall footman, {{in the most}} crimson of coats, powdered hair, and a stupendous crimson and white shoulder-knot, auch as Clara had only seen going to St. James's. She would never have imagined that she had any concern with such splendour; but her grandmother asked him if the carriage were there, as <b>a</b> mere <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> and Jane devolved on him all luggage cares, as coolly {{as if she had}} been ruling over him all his life.|$|R

They look upon our willingness to go as <b>a</b> mere <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> though I don't see why we should be expected to like banishment more than themselves. But if Prince were--" ...|$|R
25|$|Even if the guardsmen faced danger, {{it was not}} {{a danger}} that called for lethal force. The 61 shots by 28 guardsmen {{certainly}} cannot be justified. Apparently, no order to fire was given, and there was inadequate fire control discipline on Blanket Hill. The Kent State tragedy must mark the last time that, as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> loaded rifles are issued to guardsmen confronting student demonstrators.|$|E
25|$|Knowledge of the spherical {{shape of}} the Earth was {{received}} in scholarship of Late Antiquity as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> in both Neoplatonism and Early Christianity. Calcidius's fourth-century Latin commentary on and translation of Plato's Timaeus, {{which was one of}} the few examples of Greek scientific thought that was known in the Early Middle Ages, discussed Hipparchus's use of the geometrical circumstances of eclipses to compute the relative diameters of the Sun, Earth, and Moon.|$|E
25|$|From {{the late}} 1970s {{to the early}} 1990s many Americans assumed as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> that students' {{self-esteem}} acted as {{a critical factor in}} the grades that they earn in school, in their relationships with their peers, and in their later success in life. Under this assumption, some American groups created programs which aimed to increase the self-esteem of students. Until the 1990s little peer-reviewed and controlled research took place on this topic.|$|E

"If Mrs. Vanstone should die," [...] {{pursued the}} doctor, {{completing}} the question which Miss Garth {{had not the}} heart to conclude for herself, [...] "I believe I am right in telling you that the property would, as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>course,</b> go to the children. Whatever necessity there may be for the interview which Mr. Pendril requests, I can see no reason for connecting it {{with the question of}} Mr. Vanstone's presumed intestacy. But, by all means, put the question, for the satisfaction of your own mind, to Mr. Pendril himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{this talk}} is all nonsense, Nat," [...] the rector said gravely. [...] "Your {{engagement}} is <b>a</b> very serious <b>matter.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> {{now you have}} been so wonderfully fortunate, and are commander of a ship, you will, I have no doubt, have an income quite sufficient to marry upon, and, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> {{you are in a}} position to please yourself." ...|$|R

I am curious to know the details of your adventures.|$|R
25|$|The West Syrian Rite, used in Syria by the Syriac Orthodox (Jacobites) and Catholic Syrians is in {{its origin}} simply the old rite of Antioch in the Syriac language. The {{translation}} must have been made very early, evidently before the division in the church over Chalcedon, before the influence of Constantinople over the Antiochian Rite had begun. No doubt as soon as Christian communities arose {{in the rural areas}} of Syria the prayers which in the cities (Antioch, Jerusalem, etc.) were said in Greek, were, as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> translated into Syriac for common use.|$|E
25|$|Autonomous {{adaptation}} are adaptations {{that are}} reactive to climatic stimuli, and are done as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> without {{the intervention of}} a public agency. Planned adaptation can be reactive or anticipatory, i.e., undertaken before impacts are apparent. Some studies suggest that human systems have considerable capacity to adapt autonomously (Smit et al., 2001:890). Others point to constraints on autonomous adaptation, such as limited information and access to resources (p.890). Smit et al. (2001:904) concluded that relying on autonomous {{adaptation to climate change}} would result in substantial ecological, social, and economic costs. In their view, these costs could largely be avoided with planned adaptation.|$|E
25|$|Soldiers of the Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa) were persecuted {{and imprisoned}} by Russian forces as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> Most victims were {{deported}} to the gulags in the Donetsk region. In 1945 alone, {{the number of}} members of the Polish Underground State who were deported to Siberia and various labor camps in the Soviet Union reached 50,000. Units of the Red Army carried out campaigns against Polish partisans and civilians. During the Augustów chase in 1945, more than 2,000 Poles were captured and about 600 of them are presumed to have died in Soviet custody. For more information about postwar resistance in Poland see the Cursed soldiers.|$|E
6000|$|Lady Price {{felt that}} she must go, and rose up with an {{endeavour}} to retract. 'Well, it is a relief to Mr. Bevan and me to find your son not consciously in fault, for {{it would have been}} a most serious thing.

6000|$|The old brute {{pushed and}} panted and grunted up the bank, mumbling, [...] "Respect the aged and infirm!" [...] {{and all the}} time his little eyes burned like coals under the heavy, horny eyelids {{on the top of his}} {{triangular}} head, as he shoved his bloated barrel-body along between his crutched legs. Then he settled down, and, accustomed as the Jackal was to his ways, he could not help starting, for the hundredth time, when he saw how exactly the Mugger imitated a log adrift on the bar. He had even taken pains to lie at the exact angle a naturally stranded log would make with the water, having regard to the current of the season at the time and place. All this was only <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> habit, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> because the Mugger had come ashore for pleasure; but a crocodile is never quite full, and if the Jackal had been deceived by the likeness he would not have lived to philosophise over it.|$|R
50|$|When {{a player}} {{has only one}} {{remaining}} card they must remember to call last card (by saying last card aloud) before their turn has ended, to inform the other players that {{they are about to}} win. Should a player who has graduated to last card fail to call {{before the end of the}} turn in which they reach last card (that is, once the next player has started her turn after the last-card player has put down his or her second last card), he may be penalised, often to the cost of picking up one card immediately (over and above any picking up as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> routine <b>course</b> in the game).|$|R
25|$|On June 10, 2011, the Law of Return {{was tested}} when a gay male couple, one Jewish and one Catholic made Aliyah to Israel. This couple {{was the first}} same-sex, {{different}} religion married couple to request joint Aliyah Status, although opposite sex married couples of different religions receive joint Aliyah as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> The Jewish man quickly received citizenship but the decision of citizenship for his husband was delayed by the Ministry of the Interior despite the clause in the law saying the spouse of the Jewish returnee must also be granted citizenship. On August 10, 2011, the Ministry of the Interior granted citizenship to the non-Jewish husband as required by The Law of Return.|$|E
25|$|South Carolina {{no longer}} {{requires}} attorneys to be licensed separately to plead in a courtroom. Additionally, some state appellate courts require attorneys {{to obtain a}} separate certificate of admission to plead and practise in the appellate court. Federal courts require specific admission to that court's bar to practise before it. At the state appellate level and in Federal courts, there is generally no separate examination process, although some U.S. district courts require an examination on practices and procedures in their specific courts. Unless an examination is required, admission is usually granted as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> to any licensed attorney in the state where the court is located. Some federal courts will grant admission to any attorney licensed in any U.S. jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), {{the largest}} {{denomination}} of the Latter Day Saint movement, priesthood is recognized only {{in men and}} boys, who are ordained to offices in the priesthood as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> once they reach the age of 12, {{so long as they}} meet requirements of worthiness. There are no other requirements for ordination, although prior to 1978, the church did not ordain men or boys who were deemed to be of black African descent, based on the mid-19th century teachings of Brigham Young, which the church felt it could not abandon without a revelation from God. (See Black people and priesthood (LDS)). The doctrine was eliminated in 1978 and the church now allows all men to hold the priesthood, subject to worthiness.|$|E

60|$|It {{had long}} been customary, as she never changed her room, {{for those who had}} {{anything}} to say to her apart, to wheel her to her desk; where she sat, usually {{with the back of her}} chair turned towards the rest of the room, and the person who talked with her seated in a corner, on a stool which was always set in that place for that purpose. Except that it was long since the mother and son had spoken together without the intervention of a third person, it was <b>an</b> ordinary <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> within the experience of visitors for Mrs Clennam to be asked, with a word of apology for the interruption, if she could be spoken with on <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> business, and, on her replying in the affirmative, to be wheeled into the position described.|$|R
60|$|But that wasn't all. There were strange {{questions}} to decide, too, {{about this new}} dream of dead days. What could be the meaning of that mysterious baby?

I REMEMBERED the baby, now; as I remembered my mother, and my father, and Australia. There was no room for doubt as to that. The baby was an integral part of my real recollection. Floating across the dim ocean of years, I was certain that night I had once lived in such a scene, with my mamma, and baby.|$|R
