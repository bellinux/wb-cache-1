40|$|Despite {{extensive}} research on phonological awareness and reading, {{there has been}} little effort to study practical questions that would assist practitioners regarding the choice and interpretation of the phonological <b>awareness</b> <b>tests</b> available to them. This study examined the relationship between decoding (real and pseudowords) and three phonological <b>awareness</b> <b>tests</b> (segmentation, blending, and manipulation) taken from the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP) with an unselected population of first grade (n = 67) and second grade (n = 49) students. Segmentation displayed the weakest correlation with reading and accounted for no statistical variance in reading beyond what was found in the blending test. It also failed to account for a substantial amount of variance in reading that is captured by the manipulation test. Despite its popularity in educational contexts, phonological segmentation may be less useful than phonological manipulation or blending in assessing the phonological substrates of reading at these grade levels.

40|$|Introduction Behavioral {{tests of}} {{auditory}} processing {{have been applied}} in schools and highlight the association between phonological awareness abilities and auditory processing, confirming that low performance on phonological <b>awareness</b> <b>tests</b> {{may be due to}} low performance on auditory processing tests. Objective To characterize the auditory middle latency response and the phonological <b>awareness</b> <b>tests</b> and to investigate correlations between responses in a group of children with learning disorders. Methods The study included 25 students with learning disabilities. Phonological awareness and auditory middle latency response were tested with electrodes placed on the left and right hemispheres. The correlation between the measurements was performed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Results There is some correlation between the tests, especially between the Pa component and syllabic awareness, where moderate negative correlation is observed. Conclusion In this study, when phonological awareness subtests were performed, specifically phonemic awareness, the students showed a low score for the age group, although for the objective examination, prolonged Pa latency in the contralateral via was observed. Negative weak to moderate correlation for Pa wave latency was observed, as was positive weak correlation for Na-Pa amplitude...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the locally directed radon roll-out program that was conducted between 2001 and 2005 in England and Wales to increase radon <b>awareness</b> and <b>testing</b> rates. A representative sample of 1, 578 residents aged 16 and older were interviewed who lived in radon-affected areas of 15 local authorities in England and Wales that were eligible {{for participation in the}} program. The study systematically sampled across participating and nonparticipating local authorities, “actionable” and “nonactionable” radon-affected areas, and geographic regions with different campaign histories (Wales, Southwest England, and the rest of England). As a multistage sampling strategy was used, the data were analyzed from a multilevel perspective. This study found that participants living in participating local authorities had higher levels of awareness and {{were more likely to have}} tested their home for radon than participants living in nonparticipating local authorities. Similar results were found for participants living in “actionable” areas as compared to those living in “nonactionable” radon-affected areas. The study further found that radon <b>awareness</b> and <b>testing</b> rates were the highest in Southwest England and the lowest in Wales. This study suggests that the radon roll-out program has been effective in raising <b>awareness</b> and <b>testing</b> rates, and that ongoing domestic radon campaigns in Southwest England may have raised radon <b>awareness</b> and <b>testing</b> in these areas, showing important reinforcement effects of multiple risk communication campaigns...|$|R

Governments, manufacturers, and marketers can use these findings {{in their efforts to}} raise consumers’ carbon literacy and encourage more informed grocery carbon emission choices. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Phonological {{awareness}} skills {{include three}} levels syllabic, intra- syllabic and phonemic awareness, and have major influence on speech and {{reading and writing}} abilities. Thus, the assessment of children abilities in these levels is important. This study aimed to investigate and compare the performance of normal and cochlear implanted children in two types of phonological <b>awareness</b> <b>tests.</b> Method & Materials: The population of this cross-sectional study eighteen normal and eighteen cochlear implanted children 5 - 5. 5 years from the cochlear implant centers in three hospitals in Tehran and the Tehran University dormitory married, respectively. Thereafter, their phonological awareness skills were evaluated in auditory-visual modality (2010) and visual modality (2009). Finally, the {{data were analyzed using}} Mann Whithney and Spearman non-parametric tests in the spss (16. 0) software. Results: Cochlear implanted children, when compared with normal children, had lower scores in both Visual - Auditory and Auditory phonological <b>awareness</b> <b>tests</b> (p< 0. 001). Average cochlear implantation group in both “Visual – Auditory” and “Auditory” tests was: 16. 17 (6. 1) and 6. 72 (5. 9), respectively and in normal children group was 40. 5 (3. 9) and 77. 76 (13. 5). Both groups had better performances in the first test than the later one (p< 0. 001). There was also a correlation between children's scores on the two tests; but in the cochlear implanted children, this correlation was lower (r= 0. 582) than the normal ones (r= 0. 785). Conclusion: The visual – auditory test for use of the images, for assessment of phonological awareness skills in children with cochlear implants are more suitable and hearing test for the assessment of phonological awareness skills in a more sophisticated level, is useful...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{case study}} on {{morphological}} awareness in reading comprehension ability of a 14 : 6 year-old Chinese dyslexic adolescent with a reading age of 12 : 1 years. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine whether awareness of morphological knowledge helps to improve the reading comprehension ability of the ESL dyslexic adolescent. It also examines the effectiveness of a remedial intervention programme that focuses on morphological awareness training. The first objective of the study is to compare the morphological knowledge of the subject before and after the morphological awareness training. The second objective is to compare the reading comprehension ability of the subject before and after the morphological awareness training. The researcher conducted questionnaires with the subject, his parents and teacher before carrying out the remedial intervention programme (morphological awareness training). Morphological <b>awareness</b> <b>tests</b> were adapted from Carlisle’s (2000) and adopted from Stanfa’s (2010) studies. Three types of Morphological <b>Awareness</b> <b>Tests</b> were used; the Word Reading Test (WRT), Test of Morphological Structure (TMS) and Dynamic Assessment Task of Morphological Analysis (DATMA). TMS was divided into derivation and decomposition task. The Reading Comprehension Test was adapted from a Form 2 textbook from the Ministry of Education, Malaysia. The data collected was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. The findings indicated that the morphological awareness training affects the morphological knowledge of the ESL dyslexic adolescent. However, the morphological awareness training does not affect the reading comprehension ability of the subject. The lack of effect on the reading comprehension ability could be due to the limitation of the use of taught morphologically complex words in the reading comprehension test. This study recommends that further research on awareness of morphological knowledge could be conducted using bigger sample in Malaysian classrooms. More research can also be done on the use of computer and information technology programs in morphological awareness training...|$|R
