40|$|A protein {{engineering}} approach for detecting and measuring local conformational changes that accompany <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions</b> in proteins is described. Using this approach, {{we can identify}} interactions that are made or broken during <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions.</b> The method is applied to probe for changes in pairwise interactions in the chaperonin GroEL during its ATP-induced <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions.</b> Two pairwise interactions are investigated: one between subunits (Asp- 41 with Thr- 522) and the other within subunits (Glu- 409 with Arg- 501). We find that the intraring intersubunit interaction between Asp- 41 and Thr- 522 changes little during the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions</b> of GroEL, indicating that the hydrogen bond between these residues is maintained. In contrast, the intrasubunit salt bridge between Glu- 409 and Arg- 501 becomes significantly weaker during the ATP-induced <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions</b> of GroEL.

5000|$|The {{allosteric}} {{site in the}} allosteric domain of the R chains of the ATCase complex binds to the nucleotides ATP, CTP and/or UTP. There is one site with high affinity for ATP and CTP and one with 10- to 20-fold lower affinity for these nucleotides in each regulatory dimer. [...] ATP binds predominantly to the high-affinity sites and subsequently activates the enzyme, while UTP and CTP binding leads to inhibition of activity. UTP can bind to the {{allosteric site}}, but inhibition of ATCase by UTP is possible only in combination with CTP. With CTP present, UTP binding is enhanced and preferentially directed to the low-affinity sites. On the converse, UTP binding leads to enhanced affinity for CTP at the high-affinity sites and together they inhibit enzyme activity by up to 95%, while CTP binding alone inhibits activity to 50% to 70%.Comparison of the crystal structures of the T and R forms of ATCase show that it swells in size during the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition,</b> and that the catalytic subunits condense during this process. The two catalytic trimers move apart along the threefold axis by 12 Å, and they rotate about this axis by 5° each, ultimately leading to a reorientation of the regulatory subunits around their twofold axis by 15°. This quaternary structure change is associated with alterations in inter-subunit and inter-domain interactions. The interaction between subunits C1-C4 and R1 is extensively modified during this conversion. In particular, there is large movement of amino acid residues 230-254, known collectively as the 240s loop. These residues are located at the cleft between the carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate domains at the C1-C4 interface. The overall outcome of these structural changes {{is that the two}} domains of each catalytic chain come closer together, ensuring a better contact with the substrates or their analogues.|$|E

We recorded single-channel currents from bovine rod CNG channels in which mutations had been introduced in the binding domain at position 604 and/or the rat olfactory CNG channel amino terminal region had been substituted for the bovine rod amino terminal region. Using a hidden Markov modeling approach, we analyzed the kinetics of these channels activated by saturating concentrations of cGMP, cIMP, and cAMP. We used thermodynamic mutant cycles to reveal an interaction during the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition</b> between the purine ring of the cyclic nucleotides and the amino acid at position 604 in the binding site. We found that mutations at position 604 in the binding domain alter both the opening and closing rate constants for the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition,</b> indicating that the interactions between the cyclic nucleotide and this amino acid are partially formed at the time of the transition state. In contrast, the amino terminal region affects primarily the closing rate constant for the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition,</b> suggesting that the state-dependent stabilizing interactions between amino and carboxyl terminal regions are not formed at the time of the transition state for the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition.</b> We propose that the sequence of events that occurs during the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition</b> involves the formation of stabilizing interactions between the purine ring of the cyclic nucleotide and the amino acid at position 604 in the binding domain followed by the formation of stabilizing interdomain interactions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCatch-binding is a {{counterintuitive}} {{phenomenon in}} which the lifetime of a receptor/ligand bond increases when a {{force is applied to}} break the bond. Several mechanisms have been proposed to rationalize catch-binding. In the two-pathway model, the force drives the system away from its native dissociation pathway into an alternative pathway involving a higher energy barrier. Here, we analyze an allosteric model suggesting that a force applied to the complex alters the distribution of receptor conformations, and as a result, induces changes in the ligand-binding site. The model assumes explicitly that the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions</b> govern the properties of the ligand site. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the ligand is described by two relaxation times, one of which arises from the allosteric site. Therefore, we argue that one can characterize the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions</b> by studying the receptor/ligand binding. We show that the allosteric description reduces to the two-pathway model in the limit when the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions</b> are faster than the bond dissociation. The formal results are illustrated with two systems, P-selectin/PSGL- 1 and FimH/mannose, subjected to both constant and time-dependent forces.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the mechanism of}} a functionally important ATP-induced <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition</b> of GroEL, we have studied {{the effect of a}} series of metal fluoride–ADP complexes and vanadate–ADP on GroEL by kinetic fluorescence measurement of pyrene-labeled GroEL and by small-angle X-ray scattering measurement of wild-type GroEL. The metal fluorides and vanadate, complexed with ADP, are known to mimic the γ-phosphate group of ATP, but they differ in geometry and size; it is expected that these compounds will be useful for investigating the strikingly high specificity of GroEL for ATP that enables the induction of the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition.</b> The kinetic fluorescence measurement revealed that aluminium, beryllium, and gallium ions, when complexed with the fluoride ion and ADP, induced a biphasic fluorescence change of pyrenyl GroEL, while scandium and vanadate ions did not induce any kinetically observed change in fluorescence. The burst phase and {{the first phase of the}} fluorescence kinetics were reversible, while the second phase and subsequent changes were irreversible. The dependence of the burst-phase and the first-phase fluorescence changes on the ADP concentration indicated that the burst phase represents non-cooperative nucleotide binding to GroEL, and that the first phase represents the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition</b> of GroEL. Both the amplitude and the rate constant of the first phase of the fluorescence kinetics were well understood in terms of a kinetic allosteric model, which is a combination of transition state theory and the Monod–Wyman–Changeux allosteric model. From the kinetic allosteric model analysis, the relative free energy of the transition state in the metal fluoride–ADP-induced <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition</b> of GroEL was found to be larger than the corresponding free energy of the ATP-induced <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition</b> by more than 5. 5 kcal/mol. However, the X-ray scattering measurements indicated that the allosteric state induced by these metal fluoride–ADP complexes is structurally equivalent to the allosteric state induced by ATP. These results suggested that both the size and coordination geometry of γ-phosphate (and its analogs) are related to the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition</b> of GroEL. It was therefore concluded that the tetrahedral geometry of γ-phosphate (or its analogs) and the inter-atomic distance (∼ 1. 6 Å) between phosphorus (vanadium, or metal atom) and oxygen (or fluorine) are both important for inducing the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition</b> of GroEL, leading to the high selectivity of GroEL for ATP about ligand adenine nucleotides, which function as the preferred allosteric ligand...|$|E
40|$|There are {{currently}} two contradictory {{models for the}} kinetics of the ATP-induced GroEL <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition</b> occurring around 20 μM ATP. One model, proposed by Horovitz et al. demonstrates the existence of two parallel pathways for the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition</b> and an abrupt ATP-dependent switch from one pathway to the other. The other model, which was proposed by the present authors, shows no need to assume the parallel pathways, and {{a combination of the}} transition-state theory and the Monod–Wyman–Changeux model of allostery can explain the kinetics as well as the equilibrium of the transition. The discrepancy appears to be due to whether we regard the transition as reversible or irreversible. Thus, here we have investigated the reversibility of the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition</b> between 0 μM and 70 μM ATP by the use of a stopped-flow double-jump technique, which has allowed us to monitor the kinetics of the reverse reaction from the relaxed state at a high ATP concentration to the tense state at a low ATP concentration. The tryptophan fluorescence of a tryptophan-inserted variant of GroEL was used to follow the kinetics. As a result, the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition</b> was shown to be a reversible process, supporting the validity of our model. We also show that the structural environment around the ATP-binding site of GroEL in the transition state is very similar to that in the relaxed state (Φ= 0. 9) by using a Φ value analysis in the kinetic Monod–Wyman–Changeux model, which is analogous to the mutational Φ value analysis in protein folding...|$|E

In addition, FNLDH shows significant positive homotropic cooperativity also for NADH binding, which is less affected by FBP or Mg 2 + than pyruvate binding (Table 3), suggesting that FNLDH changes in its structure through two steps, the NADH binding and following pyruvate binding steps, in the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition.</b> The Lactobacillus d-LDHs consistently have dimeric structure, whereas the three d-LDHs from Gram-negative bacteria have tetrameric structure.

40|$|International audienceThe {{notion of}} {{allostery}} introduced for proteins about {{fifty years ago}} has been extended since then to DNA allostery, where a locally triggered DNA structural transition remotely controls other DNA-binding events. We further extend this notion and propose that chromatin fiber <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions,</b> induced by histone-tail covalent modifications, may {{play a key role}} in transcriptional regulation. We present an integrated scenario articulating allosteric mechanisms at different scales: <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions</b> of the condensed chromatin fiber induced by histone-tail acetylation modify the mechanical constraints experienced by the embedded DNA, thus possibly controlling DNA-binding of allosteric transcription factors or further allosteric mechanisms at the linker DNA level. At a higher scale, different epigenetic constraints delineate different statistically dominant subsets of accessible chromatin fiber conformations, which each favors the assembly of dedicated regulatory complexes, as detailed on the emblematic example of the mouse Igf 2 -H 19 gene locus and its parental imprinting. This physical view offers a mechanistic and spatially structured explanation of the observed correlation between transcriptional activity and histone modifications.

During {{the reaction}} cycle, GroEL undergoes <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions</b> {{in response to}} binding of a substrate protein (SP), ATP, and the cochaperonin GroES. Using coarse-grained representations of the GroEL and GroES structures, we explore the link between <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions</b> and the folding of a model SP, a de novo-designed four-helix bundle protein, with low spontaneous yield. The ensemble of GroEL-bound SP is less structured than the bulk misfolded structures. Upon binding, which kinetically occurs in two stages, the SP loses not only native tertiary contacts but also experiences a decrease in helical content. During multivalent binding and the subsequent ATP-driven transition of GroEL the SP undergoes force-induced stretching. Upon encapsulation, which occurs upon GroES binding, the SP finds itself in a “hydrophilic” cavity in which it can reach the folded conformation. Surprisingly, {{we find that the}} yield of the native state in the expanded GroEL cavity is relatively small even after it remains in it for twice the spontaneous folding time.

Binding of cAMP results in a coil-to-helix transition that extends the coiled-coil dimerization interface of CAP by 3 turns of helix and concomitantly causes rotation, by ≈ 60 °, and translation, by ≈ 7 Å, of the DNA-binding domains (DBDs) of CAP, positioning the recognition helices in the DBDs in the correct orientation to interact with DNA.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{allosteric}} hexameric enzyme glucosamine- 6 -phosphate deaminase from Escherichia coli catalyses {{the regulatory}} step of N-acetylglucosamine catabolism, {{which consists of}} the isomerisation and deamination of glucosamine 6 -phosphate (GlcN 6 P) to form fructose 6 -phosphate (Fru 6 P) and ammonia. The reversibility of the catalysis and its rapid-equilibrium random kinetic mechanism, among other properties, make this enzyme a good model for studying allosteric processes. Results: Here we present the structure of P 6322 crystals, obtained in sodium acetate, of GlcN 6 P deaminase in its ligand-free T state. These crystals {{are very sensitive to}} X-ray radiation and have a high (78 %) solvent content. The active-site lid (residues 162 – 185) is highly disordered in the T conformer; this may contribute significantly to the free-energy change of the whole <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition.</b> Comparison of the structure with the crystallographic coordinates of the R conformer (Brookhaven Protein Data Bank entry 1 dea) allows us to describe the geometrical changes associated with the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition</b> as the movement of two rigid entities within each monomer. The active site, located in a deep cleft between these two rigid entities, presents a more open geometry in the T conformer than in the R conformer. Conclusions: The differences in active-site geometry are related to alterations in the substrate-binding properties associated with the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transition.</b> The rigid nature of the two mobile structural units of each monomer seems to be essential in order to explain the observed kinetics of the deaminase hexamer.

40|$|Abstract. Although the {{importance}} of protein dynamics in protein function is generally recognized, the role of protein fluctuations in allosteric effects scarcely has been considered. To address this gap, the Kullback-Leibler divergence (Dx) between protein conformational distributions before and after ligand binding was proposed {{as a means of}} quantifying allosteric effects in proteins. Here, previous applications of Dx to methods for analysis and simulation of proteins are first reviewed, and their implications for understanding aspects of protein function and protein evolution are discussed. Next, equations for Dx suggest that kBTDx should be interpreted as an allosteric free energy – the free energy associated with changing the ligand-free protein conformational distribution to the ligand-bound conformational distribution. This interpretation leads to a thermodynamic model of <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions</b> that unifies existing perspectives on the relation between ligand binding and changes in protein conformational distributions. The definition of Dx is used to explore some interesting mathematical relations among commonly recognized thermodynamic and biophysical quantities, such as the total free energy change upon ligand binding, and ligand-binding affinities for individual protein conformations. These results represent the beginnings of a theoretical framework for considering the full protein conformational distribution in modeling <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions.</b> Early applications of the framework have produced results with implications both for methods for coarsed-grained modeling of proteins, and for understanding the relation between ligand binding and protein dynamics...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The Escherichia coli {{chaperonin}} GroEL, {{which helps}} proteins to fold, {{consists of two}} heptameric rings stacked back-to-back. During the reaction cycle GroEL undergoes a series of <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions</b> triggered by ligand (substrate protein, ATP, and the cochaperonin GroES) binding. Based on an elastic network model of the bullet-shaped double-ring chaperonin GroEL-(ADP) 7 -GroES structure (R$T state), we perform a normal mode analysis to explore the energetically favorable col-lective motions encoded in the R$T structure. By comparing each normal mode with the observed conformational changes in the R$T / TR $ transition, a single dominant normal mode provides a simple description of this highly intricate allosteric tran-sition. A detailed analysis of this relatively high-frequency mode describes the structural and dynamic changes that underlie the positive intra-ring and negative inter-ring cooperativity. The dynamics embedded in the dominant mode entails highly concerted structural motions with approximate preservation of sevenfold symmetry within each ring and negatively correlated ones between the two rings. The dominant normal mode (in comparison with the other modes) is robust to parametric perturbations caused by sequence variations, which validates its functional importance. Response of the dominant mode to local changes that mimic mutations using the structural perturbation method technique leads to a wiring diagram that identifies a network of key residues that regulate the <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions.</b> Many of these residues are located in intersubunit interfaces, and may therefore {{play a critical role}} in transmitting allosteric signals between subunits...|$|R

One solution to this problem is to explore the dynamics of PDZs, which may provide insights about how intramolecular communication occurs within a single domain. Here, we develop an advancement of perturbation response scanning (PRS) that couples elastic network models with linear response theory (LRT) to predict key residues in <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions</b> of the two most studied PDZs (PSD- 95 PDZ 3 domain and hPTP 1 E PDZ 2 domain). With PRS, we first identify the residues that give the highest mean square fluctuation response upon perturbing the binding sites. Strikingly, we observe that the residues with the highest mean square fluctuation response agree with experimentally determined residues involved in <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions.</b> Second, we construct the allosteric pathways by linking the residues giving the same directional response upon perturbation of the binding sites. The predicted intramolecular communication pathways reveal that PSD- 95 and hPTP 1 E have different pathways through the dynamic coupling of different residue pairs. Moreover, our analysis provides a molecular understanding of experimentally observed hidden allostery of PSD- 95. We show that removing the distal third alpha helix from the binding site alters the allosteric pathway and decreases the binding affinity.

In contrast, allostetic equilibria were strongly shifted towards the desensifized state in CHAPS. Therefore, the effect of CHAPS likely results from molecular interactions {{rather than from the}} loss of bulk physical properties of the membrane environment. 2002 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

40|$|The Escherichia coli {{chaperonin}} protein GroEL {{can assist}} protein folding to its native state through {{the consumption of}} ATP. Accompanying this process, GroEL undergoes structural change, resulting in {{an expansion of the}} central cavity. Monitoring apical domain movement by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between two mobile apical fluorophores, can provide information about the GroEL <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions.</b> To reach this goal, the three native cysteine residues on each subunit of wild type GroEL were removed and a new cysteine site in the apical domain was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. Fluorescent probes were attached to the cysteine residues, allowing us to perform FRET experiments. The observed change of FRET efficiency (E) reported the GroEL structural changes...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{importance}} of protein dynamics in protein function is generally recognized, the role of protein fluctuations in allosteric effects scarcely has been considered. To address this gap, the Kullback-Leibler divergence (Dx) between protein conformational distributions before and after ligand binding was proposed {{as a means of}} quantifying allosteric effects in proteins. Here, previous applications of Dx to methods for analysis and simulation of proteins are first reviewed, and their implications for understanding aspects of protein function and protein evolution are discussed. Next, equations for Dx suggest that k_{B}TDx should be interpreted as an allosteric free energy [...] the free energy associated with changing the ligand-free protein conformational distribution to the ligand-bound conformational distribution. This interpretation leads to a thermodynamic model of <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions</b> that unifies existing perspectives on the relation between ligand binding and changes in protein conformational distributions. The definition of Dx is used to explore some interesting mathematical relations among commonly recognized thermodynamic and biophysical quantities, such as the total free energy change upon ligand binding, and ligand-binding affinities for individual protein conformations. These results represent the beginnings of a theoretical framework for considering the full protein conformational distribution in modeling <b>allosteric</b> <b>transitions.</b> Early applications of the framework have produced results with implications both for methods for coarsed-grained modeling of proteins, and for understanding the relation between ligand binding and protein dynamics.
