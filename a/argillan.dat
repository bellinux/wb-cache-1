50|$|Cutans are the {{modification}} of the soil texture, or soil structure, at natural surfaces (particle, pore, or ped) in soil materials due to illuviation. Cutans are oriented deposits which can be composed {{of any of the}} component substances of the soil material. Cutans are common features in soil and represent focuses of chemical and biological reactions. Cutans may include clay skins or coatings of silica, sesquioxide, manganese, ferromanganese, soil organic matter or carbonate. Clay skins are also called <b>argillans,</b> and soil horizons with sufficient clay illuviation are termed argillic horizons.|$|R
40|$|This {{experimental}} study examines {{the relationship between}} texture and microfabric under isotropic stresses generated by wetting and drying. This {{can be achieved by}} observing and measuring the reorganization of microfabrics (plasmic fabrics and related distribution pattern, RDP). Microfabrics are produced in the laboratory by mixing montmorillonite with various proportions of sand and silt, and subjecting them to wetting and drying without confinement. Thin sections are cut to study their microfabrics. Results show broad and systematic variations in fabric with changes in texture. Fine matrix (silt plus clay in physical continuity) is developed in samples with low sand:silt ratio, and regardless of this ratio at high clay levels. Coarse porphyric and fine porphyric RDP are formed at low and high clay contents, respectively. Plasmic fabrics are represented mainly by insepic and weakly developed mosepic and masepic fabrics in the matrix in the form of small plasma separations with random orientation, and weak skelsepic plasma as embedded grain <b>argillans.</b> On the other hand, coarse matrix (sand grains in physical continuity) dominates the sandy samples which are associated with relatively thick and strongly birefringent free grain <b>argillans</b> giving well-developed skelsepic fabric. The RDP follows two major paths: beginning with orthogranic (very low clay content) along the iunctic sequence at low clay:silt ratio and along the chlamydic sequence at high ratio. The regularities in fabric development are interpreted {{in the light of the}} dynamic properties and behaviour of the active clay fraction in a clay-water system. The pedogenetic implications of the results are explored, and the term "erdic" fabric defined. © 1984. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

A soil profile exhibiting strong textural differentiation between surface and subsurface horizons at Keyneton, South Australia, was sampled for {{quantitative and qualitative}} analyses of the processes responsible for development. From constant resistant mineral ratios throughout the profile it was concluded that the soil had formed from uniform parent material, suggesting that pedological processes had heavily influenced formation. Particle size distribution, clay mineralogy determined by XRD, and microstructural features indicated that clay accumulation in the subsurface was accompanied by a greater intensity of weathering in the surface horizons. The presence of void <b>argillans</b> in the B horizon provided strong evidence for the translocation of clay. Mass balance calculations showed significant volumetric expansion and mass gain throughout the entire profile, but greatest in the B horizons. Al, Fe, Na and Si were all gained in large quantities. The results indicate that clay translocation by illuviation is a dominant process in the development of textural differentiation, with some clay likely to have formed in situ. Thesis (B. Sc.

40|$|Before 2009, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) staff noticed plant {{roots and}} <b>argillans</b> {{deep within the}} B horizon of Gosport polypedons (a fine, illitic, mesic Oxyaquic Dystrudept) while {{updating}} Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 108 (Illinois and Iowa deep loess and drift) and 109 (Iowa and Missouri heavy till plain) in the central United States. In 2009, Gosport soils in MLRAs 108 and 109 were remapped and reclassified. Both map unit transects and the relevé method were used to identify pedons for detailed laboratory analyses. Eight pedons representing Gosport soils were collected from eight counties in southern Iowa, USA (Davis, Jefferson, Keokuk, Lucas, Mahaska, Marion, Monroe, and Van Buren). All of the pedons were described, analyzed, and classified. The results revealed two groups of soils, which are different than that of Gosport: Alfisols, newly named as the Munterville series (fine, mixed, smectitic or kaolinitic, active or superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs), and Ultisols (fine, mixed or kaolinitic, active, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludults) {{that have not yet}} been assigned a series name.

40|$|Soils in the Kansas Cherokee Prairies {{have formed}} in various parent {{materials}} and exhibit {{differences in the}} degree of expression of vertic properties. Despite large clay contents, few soils meet the criteria for a Vertisol. In an effort to investigate the cause of these differences, pedogenic processes, primarily clay illuviation and shrink–swell processes, were evaluated in eight pedons. Relatively high coefficient of linear extensibility (COLE) values were found in all soils. The clay mineralogy of four sites was dominated by smectite, but only two of those sites classified as Vertisols. In the other four sites, smectite was the most common clay mineral, yet there were several other clay minerals present in significant quantities. Disruption of illuvial clay features by shrink–swell movement was evident in the thin sections of all soils. Striated b-fabrics dominated except in surface soils that exhibited a small COLE value and occurred above an argillic horizon. Linear planes lined with stress-oriented clay and representing zones of shear failure were observed, along with <b>argillans</b> that had been distorted and embedded within the matrix by swelling pressure and soil movement. In conclusion, when present, a nonexpansive silty surface layer acts as a buffer and may limit shrink–swell by allowing expansive subsoils to dry more slowly. Paul E. Hartley, DeAnn R.

40|$|Neste trabalho, objetivou-se realizar a caracterização mineralógica e micromorfológica de solos planossólicos do Sertão do Araripe, estado de Pernambuco, visando proporcionar melhor entendimento de suas propriedades e dos processos envolvidos em sua gênese. Tais solos foram, até então, pouco estudados e se caracterizam pela ocorrência de um horizonte B plânico subjacente a um horizonte B textural, plíntico ou não. No município de Ouricuri, foram selecionados três perfis representativos destes solos, classificados como: Plintossolo Argilúvico eutrófico planossólico sódico (perfil 1); Argissolo Amarelo eutrófico planossólico solódico (perfil 2) e Argissolo Amarelo eutrófico plíntico planossólico sódico (perfil 3). A mineralogia das frações calhau e cascalho foi determinada macroscopicamente, enquanto a da areia, por lupa binocular. As frações silte e argila foram analisadas por difratometria de raios X. As descrições micromorfológicas foram {{realizadas}} em seções delgadas de amostras de horizontes selecionados. A fração areia destes solos é essencialmente composta por quartzo, mas feldspatos e mica também ocorrem a partir do horizonte 2 Btbn. O silte é basicamente constituído por quartzo, feldspatos e mica. A argila é composta por caulinita, mica, interestratificados irregulares, esmectita e quartzo, ocorrendo as maiores quantidades de esmectita e interestratificados nos horizontes 2 Btbn e 2 BCn. O horizonte B plânico (2 Btbn) apresenta microestrutura em blocos angulares e expressivos argilãs (de iluviação e intemperização), enquanto o horizonte Bt sobrejacente apresenta microestrutura granular e ausência de qualquer tipo de argilã. A disparidade observada na mineralogia da fração argila e as distintas feições micromorfológicas corroboram a identificação de uma mudança de material de origem entre os horizontes Bt e B plânico dos solos estudados. A posição do horizonte B plânico, que apresenta muitos argilãs de iluviação, e a ausência de características que evidenciem mobilização de argila do Bt precedente revelam uma paleopedogênese para o solo. Estes resultados indicam que os solos foram desenvolvidos em duas etapas. As rochas do embasamento cristalino sofreram uma primeira pedogênese, da qual o marco atual de evidência é a camada de litofragmentos, em sua maioria arestados, que ocorre no topo do B plânico, e que foi, provavelmente, acumulada pela erosão diferencial, formando um pavimento desértico. Posteriormente, os solos foram recobertos por camadas de sedimentos intemperizados, relacionados com a Chapada do Araripe, que se misturaram, em proporções variadas, ao material já edafizado das rochas do embasamento. Estes materiais estão, desde sua deposição, sendo retrabalhados pelos processos pedogenéticos atuais. The {{objective of}} the present study was to characterize the mineralogy and micromorphology of soils with stagnic properties from the micro region of Araripina, in the Sertão Zone of Pernambuco State aiming to improve the understanding of their properties and pedogenic processes. Up to now, these soils have been poorly studied. They are characterized by the presence of a solodic or natric B horizon underlying a normal argic B horizon. Three representative soil profiles were selected in Ouricuri County. According to the World Reference Base for Soil Resources they are classified as: Natric Stagnic Sesquisol (profile 1); Solodic Stagnic Lixisol (profile 2), and Plinthic Stagnic Lixisol (profile 3). The mineralogy of the coarse fractions was determined macroscopically or by using a binocular magnifying lens, while the silt and clay fractions were analyzed by X-ray diffraction. Selected horizons were micromorphologically described based on thin soil sections. The sand fraction of the studied soils is essentially composed by quartz, but feldspars and micas were also detected in the 2 Btbn horizons. The silt fraction contains mostly quartz, feldspars and mica. The clay fraction is composed by kaolinite, mica, irregular interstratified minerals, smectite, and quartz. The highest amount of smectites and interstratified clay minerals were observed in the 2 Btbn and 2 BCn horizons. The solodic or natric B horizons (2 Btbn) is characterized by the presence of a blocky microstructure and well developed illuviation and weathering <b>argillans,</b> while the overlying argic B horizon has a granular microstructure and no <b>argillans.</b> The differences observed in the clay mineralogy and micromorphological features between the argic B horizon and the underlying poorly drained solodic or natric B horizon indicate the presence of two parent materials. The position of this Na-rich B horizon, which is high in <b>argillans,</b> and the absence of evidences of clay eluviations from the overlying argic B horizon suggest a paleopedogenesis for this horizon. Results indicate that the soils were developed in two stages. The first pedogenesis occurred on the crystalline rock basement. One of the evidences is the edged stone layer on top of the solodic or natric B horizon, probably formed because of differential erosion, originating a desertic pavement. Afterwards, the soils were covered by layers of highly weathered sediments, related to the Araripe high tableland, which were mixed at varied proportions with the topsoil of the underlying weathered parent material. Both materials have been affected by current pedogenic processes since their deposition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Æolian dust {{deposits}} {{are known}} to be widespread in south-eastern Australia, with the dominant model being that of ‘parna’, an aggregated material comprising clay, calcium carbonate, and silt-sized quartz. Despite a general acceptance of the parna model, there is surprisingly little evidence of silt-sized clay aggregates remaining in parna profiles. To investigate a relatively pure æolian dust deposit within the proposed zone of parna distribution, we examined the various phases of 3 source-bordering sand dunes on the lower Lachlan River floodplain of south-western NSW. In each dune exists an upper-slope phase of coarse brown sand, a mid-slope layer of reddish, clay-enriched sand, and a lower-slope phase of coarse sand dominated by an accumulation of carbonate glaebules. Granulometric analyses of the clay-enriched phase(s) of each dune identified a conspicuous particle population in the 20 – 60 µm range, and another in the fine-silt/clay range (< 10 µm). Mineralogical characterisation revealed an abundance of illite and kaolinite in the upper 2 dune phases, coupled with a minor amount of smectite, further suggesting an allochthonous æolian origin, as the surrounding floodplain is smectite-rich and relatively poor in illite. Micromorphological features within the clay-enriched phase, including abundant <b>argillans</b> and laminar bands of well-sorted fine quartz grains, indicate that this clay is a depositional feature, illuviated from surface horizons and re-deposited at depth. A similar illuvial origin is suggested by the fine crystalline nature of the calcium carbonate accumulation, ubiquitously coating the matrix mineral grains of the lower dune phase. No discrete clay aggregate...|$|R
40|$|The Authors {{describe}} a sequence some 4 metres thick composed of slope and loess deposits which lies {{at an altitude}} of 360 metres, 20 metres above the Torrente Agna. The series belongs to a polyciclic soil composed of 4 lithostratigraphic units which, from the bottom to the top, are as follows: - slightly weathered loess (IV CI); - red clayey soil sediments (Ill B 2) resulting from the erosion of a more ancient paleosol of «Terra Rossa» type, developed during the Middle Pleistocene {{at the top of the}} Carvanno Tarvertine; - undisturbed loess and loess displaced by gelifluction (II B 21 till B 231); - recent colluvial deposits (A I + B 1). The sequence was deposited between the Upper Pleistocene and the Holocene. During the Upper Pleistocene the loess deposition, alternated with colluvial and gelifluction phases, was caused by cold-humid climatic conditions. During the postglacial, the loess was affected by weathering which lead to the development of an alfisol. The micromorphological analysis evidenced several stages in the postglacial soil forming process. First, in unstable geomorphological conditions, complex cutans (scheletans-matransiltans) covered the walls of the soil pores. In a later period, as a result of landscape stability, laminated and birefringent [erri-argillans were mainly deposited. The deposition of the upper colluvial cover (AI + BI) and the coarse fills of the underlying horizons were produced by a degradational phase due to the deforestation of the area in historical times. The undisturbed <b>argillans</b> of the AI + BI horizons indicate that the clay illuviation is still active in the area...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Different parent {{materials}} {{participate in}} the formation of soils in the hilly landscape of “Mar de Morros” in the Atlantic Forest environment. Those derived from mafic igneous rock (gabbro) frequently show erosion problems because of land use, which is aggravated by the mountainous relief and soil attributes. This study evaluated the main pedogenic processes of soils formed from mafic igneous rock (gabbro) in a toposequence in Pinheiral (RJ) by characterizing physical, chemical, mineralogical and micromorphological attributes. The profiles are located at different sections in the toposequence: summit (P 1), shoulder (P 2), backslope (P 3) and footslope (P 4). They were classified according to the Brazilian System of Soil Classification (SiBCS) and correlated to Soil Taxonomy. The soil morphology of profiles P 2, P 3 and P 4 is expressed by a brownish-red color, blocky structure with high to moderate development, clay films and clay loam to clay texture, with a textural B horizon. P 1 shows less development, with a shallow profile and the sequence of horizons A-C-Cr. The soils have a slightly low degree of weathering, identified by the presence of pyroxenes and feldspars in the sand fraction and montorillonite in the clay fraction; the sum of bases is from 15 to 24 cmolc kg- 1; and cation exchange capacity (CEC) is from 12 to 22 cmolc kg- 1. A significant presence of clay skins was observed in the field and was confirmed by thin section analysis, which showed features such as <b>argillans,</b> ferriargillans and iron nodules. The soil profile at the summit (P 1) was classified as Neossolo Regolítico Órtico (Typic Udorthents), and the other profiles as Chernossolo Argilúvicos Órticos (Typic Argiudolls) ...|$|R
40|$|Cores of the Iatan Limestone and {{overlying}} Stranger Shale {{in southwestern}} Iowa display characteristics of paleosol development {{other than the}} weathered-clay or caliche horizons or underclay type of paleosol profiles from the Upper Pennsylvanian in the Midcontinent described by other authors. Paleosol features in the Iatan-Stranger sequence include clay-filled fractures and solution channels (cryptokarst) {{in the top of}} the Iatan Limestone which display some degree of secondary clay orientation along the edges (neostrians). The clay-filled fractures widen upward and grade into the gray to red mottled, non-calcareous, blocky mudstone of the Stranger Shale, which is characterized by an absence of fauna and presence of slickensides, clay coatings on grains (<b>argillans),</b> quartz silt-filled fractures (skeletans), and possible former rooted zones. The mudstone matrix locally displays the sepic plasmic fabrics that are characteristic of soil development. Pedogenesis in this unit resulted from subaerial exposure during retreat of the sea following the transgressive-regressive marine cycle that deposited the Iatan Limestone. Solution-channelling of the top of the Iatan and leaching of clays within its fractures indicates initial exposure to a humid climate with strong meteoric flux. The Stranger paleosol, however, displays features of Entisol, Inceptisol, or Vertisol development in terrestrial deposits under a somewhat drier climate following the partial solution of the upper Iatan. These features include a thick (1 to 2. 4 m) paleosol profile with weak morphologic expression which contains crystalline illitic clays and oxidized iron minerals. Lack of fluvial-alluvial features in the thick, monotonous quartz-silty mudstone sequence of the lower Stranger Shale suggests that fine aeolian detrital influx (desert loess) may have contributed much of the material to this unit. The lack of caliche or weathered clays in the Stranger mudstone indicates the importance of using multiple lines of evidence for recognizing paleosols...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Horizons {{with varying}} degrees of {{cementation}} are a common feature of the soils from the coastal tablelands of Northeastern Brazil. In most cases, these horizons are represented by the following subsurface horizons: fragipan, duripan, ortstein, and placic. The aims of this study were to analyze differences regarding the development and the degree of expression of cementation in soils from the coastal tablelands of Northeastern Brazil: Planossolo Háplico (p-SX), Espodossolo Humilúvico (p-EK), Espodossolo Ferrihumilúvico (p-ESK), and Argissolo Acinzentado (p-PAC) pedons. The pedons studied displayed features related to drainage impediments. The cemented horizons from p-SX and p-EK had the same designation (Btgm), displaying a duric character that coincided with gleization features and are under podzolized horizons. In the p-ESK, the podzolization process is of such magnitude that it leads to the cementation of its own spodic horizons, which were both of the ortstein type (Bhsx and Bsm). In the p-PAC cementation is observed in two placic horizons and in the Btx/Bt horizon, {{as well as in the}} upper parts of the Bt/Btx horizon. Analysis of the micrographies from the cemented horizons showed predominance of a low porosity matrix. Such porosity is relatively greater in the horizons of &# 8220;x&# 8221; subscript than in the horizons with duric character. The Fe segregation lines were notable in the cemented horizons from p-EK and p-PAC, which corroborates the presence of placic horizons in such pedons. The preponderance of kaolinite in the clay fraction was widely verified in all the cemented horizons analyzed. Water immersion tests were the criteria adopted to define the duric character of the Btgm horizons from p-SX and p-EK, and in the Bsm horizon from the p-ESK. These tests were also used to confirm field morphology. In most cases, the maximum values of Fe, Al, and Si, determined by different extractions, occurred in positions overlaying the cemented horizons, whether they were spodic or not. The extracts of the aqueous solution displayed a noticeable accumulation of Si in the cemented horizons, except in the p-PAC. The presence of <b>argillans</b> in all cemented horizons allows them to be defined as illuvial, with the exception of the placic horizons, regardless of the presence of podzolization processes. The cemented horizons were preponderantly apedal, with a matrix of little porosity. The Fe, Al, and Si contents extracted by acid ammonium oxalate were effective at highlighting the influence of compounds with a low degree of crystallinity in the morphology of cemented horizons...|$|R
40|$|Gypsum {{accumulation}} {{is one of}} {{the prominent}} pedogenic processes occurring in many arid regions of the world. Gypsiferous soils are common in large areas of the Iranian central plateau. There has been a long debate about the source of gypsum, mechanism(s) of gypsum deposition, and the genesis of associated silicate clay minerals in these soils. The main objectives of this thesis were to: (1) trace the source of gypsum, (2) understand the mechanism(s) of the accumulation of high amounts of gypsum, and (3) study the clay mineralogy and micromorphology of gypsiferous soils from the Isfahan region, central Iran. Soil samples from 15 pedons occurring in three different landscapes, river and rain waters, and dominant parent rock samples from the area were studied. Stable isotope techniques coupled with mineralogical, submicroscopic, and micromorphological studies provided an insight into an understanding of the pedological processes involved {{in the formation of the}} soils. The sulfur and oxygen stable isotope data of the soil gypsum and dissolved sulfate indicate that the gypsum in the soils originates from the local sedimentary rocks tying in well with the hypothesis that central Iran was part of the Tethyan geosynclinal belt which was cut off from the sea in the late Mesozoic era. Both δ 34 S and δ 18 O values of the soil gypsum decrease from high elevations in colluvial fans to plateaus and eventually to the lowest positions in the toposequence (alluvial plains). Dissolution-precipitation followed by the less significant process of adsorption-desorption of sulfate appear to be the possible mechanisms responsible for the restricted isotope fractionation. Palygorskite is the dominant silicate clay mineral in both fine and coarse clay fractions of the soils, and of the Oligo-Miocene limestone, a parent rock that forms low hills in the area. The mountains are underlain by Jurassic shale and Cretaceous limestone, which contain illite and chlorite with a trace amount of palygorskite. The association of extremely large amounts of well-formed palygorskite bundles with gypsum in the soils supports the hypothesis that palygorskite was mainly formed after the initial precipitation of gypsum, which created high pH and Mg/Ca ratio when central Iran was covered by the post-Tethys sea shallow hyper-saline lagoons. In addition, examination of pedogenic carbonates by scanning electron microscope, and ultra-microtomic cuts by transmission electron microscope reveal that the pedogenic calcite crystals are intimately associated with palygorskite. Evidence of illuviation in colluvial soils is the increase in the fine to total clay ratio in the argillic horizon compared to the overlying horizon in the colluvial soils and also well-developed, but considerably disrupted, <b>argillans</b> observed in thin sections.
