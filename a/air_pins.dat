It {{includes}} a complex infantry series (including navigation, survival, etc.), Parachuting course, escaping workshop, Officers Ordination and Academic Studies (lasts about five weeks). At {{the end of}} this phase the cadets receive an <b>air</b> crew <b>pin,</b> which is equivalent to the platoon commander pin which is granted to graduates of officers school.|$|R
40|$|A new {{chromium}} carbide-based coating (PS 200) is described. This coating {{is shown}} to have good friction and wear properties over a wide temperature range. A nickel alloy-bonded chromium carbide coating {{was used as a}} baseline material for comparison with experimental formulated coatings. Coatings were plasma sprayed onto metal disks, then diamond ground to a thickness of 0. 025 cm. Friction and wear were determined using a pin on disk tribometer at temperatures from 25 to 900 C in hydrogen, helium, and <b>air.</b> <b>Pin</b> materials included several metallic alloys and silicon carbide. It was found that appropriate additions of metallic silver and of barium fluoride/calcium fluoride eutectic to the baseline carbide composition significantly reduced friction coefficients while preserving, and in some cases, even enhancing wear resistance. The results of this study demonstrate that PS 200 is a promising coating composition to consider for high temperature aerospace and advanced heat engine applications. The excellent results in hydrogen make this coating of particular interest for use in the Stirling engine...|$|R

It was significantly greater than 50 % for London planetree (Platanus x acerifolia (<b>Air.)</b> Willd.), <b>pin</b> oak, and red oak (Quercus rubra L.); and significantly less than 50 % for green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh.), white pine (Pinus strobus L.), and, marginally, for honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos L.), red maple (Acer rubrum L.), and red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.).|$|R
50|$|When Richard reappears in Daddy's Little Girl, {{his powers}} have become far more {{powerful}} and refined. He demonstrates a much greater precision over small objects. He is able to summon a tomato to his hand from a great distance, stop a tranquilizer dart, and even render someone unconscious by pinching off the {{blood flow to the}} person's brain. He is able to effortlessly throw multiple full-grown adults through the <b>air</b> or <b>pin</b> them against walls- even if not in the immediate vicinity- as well as fling concrete barriers weighing hundred or possibly thousands of pounds with pinpoint accuracy.|$|R
40|$|The surface bulk {{temperature}} of a titanium alloy pin sliding on an alumina flat disk surface is estimated semi-empirically {{by measuring the}} temperature at two points along the pin axis away from the sliding interface and assuming a realistic flow field of <b>air</b> around the <b>pin.</b> The predicted temperatures {{are found to be}} better estimates than those given by ab initio calculations...|$|R
50|$|They {{are most}} often seen soaring on warm {{thermals}} but may be seen on almost any type of raised perch (from sign posts to large trees). They prey on almost any small to medium-sized animals that can be caught, but smallish mammals comprise more than 90% of prey in some studies. The most commonly recorded prey includes cavies, tuco-tucos, rabbits, mice and páramo rats. Earthworms, weevils, orthopterans and other invertebrates are often taken. Birds are sometimes taken, including tired petrels around Juan Fernández Islands. Other prey include other rodents & lagomorphs, frogs, lizards, snakes, and fish. The variable hawk hunts with prey being spotted while soaring from the <b>air</b> and <b>pinned</b> on the ground.|$|R
5000|$|Miller then rejoined TF 38 {{which had}} resumed air {{operations}} against the Philippines. The force raided air installations on Luzon, Leyte, and Samar into November, receiving, on the 19th, its {{first taste of}} a new Japanese tactic, the kamikaze. Six days later several of the suicide planes broke through the screen of planes and destroyers to score hits on the carriers , , and [...] With slight damage, except to Intrepid, the force retired to Ulithi. Thence the force sortied, 11 December, to support amphibious operations on Mindoro, and keep Japanese <b>air</b> forces <b>pinned</b> to the ground. Next came strikes on Taiwan, followed by another return to the Philippines to support amphibious operations, this time in Lingayen Gulf.|$|R
40|$|We {{present results}} of an {{experimental}} investigation of Marangoni convection for an evaporating meniscus in open <b>air</b> <b>pinned</b> {{at the mouth of}} a capillary tube. Four different liquids have been studied: ethanol, methanol, acetone and, for the first time, also FC- 72. This experimental configuration has been studied before by the present authors and others. However, {{it is the first time}} that the effect of the capillary tube thickness and material is experimentally investigated. In particular, the study considered the same internal diameter for all the tubes (1. mm) and three borosilicate external diameters (1. 4, 2, and 3. mm) as well as one polycarbonate (1. 25. mm) and one sapphire (3. mm). These three tube materials were chosen for their very different thermal properties and their optical transparency. The evaporation rate is measured by tracking the second meniscus receding inside the capillary tube while the first one is pinned at the tube mouth. It was found that the evaporation rate is influenced more by the thermal conductivity of the tubes than the wall thickness. An infrared camera has also been employed to measure the interfacial temperature at the meniscus pinned at the tube mouth and also along the wall of the tube close to the tube mouth. In addition, a heat transfer analysis has been performed at the tube mouth along with a mass transfer analysis which allowed the evaluation of the temperature of the meniscus interface and the evaporation rate, respectively, and comparing these results with the measured ones. The deviation found is maximum 65 % between measured and calculated temperature differences between wall and meniscus and 6. 7 % for the evaporation rate. The results are qualitatively assessed in the light of those obtained for evaporating sessile drops and the trends found are similar. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of {{accounting for the}} temperature dependence of air properties in numerical simulations of <b>air</b> flows over <b>pinned</b> heat sinks is demonstrated by comparisons with recently published experiments. Numerical simulations, based on a conjugate heat transfer analysis, using the RANS-based modified k-ω turbulence model, with temperature-dependent air properties, are shown to be in significantly better agreement with experimental measurements of pressure drop, heat transfer coefficient, and heat sink base temperature, than those which employ constant air properties...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Die {{design rule}} for {{semi-solid}} die casting (SSDC) with A 356 electromagnetic stirring (EMS) aluminum alloy, was proposed. The die design rule included inspection of machine, part requirements, parting line determination, sleeve, plunger, gating system, overflow, <b>air</b> vent, ejector <b>pin,</b> and heating line design. The specification of gating system, overflow, air vent, plunger tip, and sleeve suitable for respective part were regulated. Two steps die system of lower-positioned gate and three steps die system of center-positioned gate were manufactured for 4 automobile suspension parts, {{based on the}} die design rule. For the sound filling pattern and solidification behavior, injection speeds of 4 parts were summarized to the interval (from V 1 to V 4). As a result of observing the microstructure of 4 parts after T 6 heat treatment, primary Al-α phase was globularized and fine Si particles were distributed around the grain boundary. The mechanical properties of 4 parts with T 6 heat treatment were investigated and showed ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 330 MPa, yield strength (YS) of 250 MPa, and elongation of 7. 5 % as average...|$|R
50|$|When the P.11 entered {{service in}} 1934, as a {{contemporary}} of the British Gloster Gauntlet and German Heinkel He 51 it was {{arguably the most}} advanced fighter in the world. However, due to the quick progress in aircraft technology, the P.11 was obsolete by 1939, overtaken by cantilever designs with retractable landing gear such as the British Supermarine Spitfire and German Messerschmitt Bf 109. Together with the older P.7, both remained the only Polish fighters in service, however, with about 185 P.11s available, distributed within six air regiments and the aviation school in Deblin. Although aware that the P.11 was outdated, the Polish <b>Air</b> Force had <b>pinned</b> their hopes on the new PZL.50 Jastrząb, which suffered extended delays. When {{it became apparent that}} the PZL.50 would not be in widespread service in time for a war that was clearly looming, consideration was given to producing an updated P.11 version with the 840 hp (626 kW) Mercury VIII and an enclosed cockpit, known as the P.11g Kobuz (hobby). Only the prototype of the P.11g with a maximum speed increase to a still-slow 390 km/h (~240 mph) was flown before the war, in August 1939.|$|R
50|$|The second {{match was}} a tag team match between The Twin Towers (Akeem and Big Boss Man) and The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty). Bossman slapped on Michaels {{in the corner}} and turned around to look on Jannetty but when he turned back, Michaels hit him a missile dropkick. He hit Akeem and Boss Man with flying forearm smashes before Bossman tagged in Akeem. The Rockers worked on Akeem's arm before he powered out and tagged Bossman. Jannetty tagged in and was hit with a leapfrog. Twin Towers took turns and beat Jannetty. He avoided a big splash by Akeem and tagged Michaels. Rockers hit Akeem with Double Flying Fists and Michaels tried a near-fall on Akeem. Akeem hit Michaels a lariat. Boss Man tagged in and tried to hit a corner body splash on Michaels but he sidestepped, getting a near-fall. They hit Akeem with a double dropkick and they hit Boss Man with a double missile dropkick. Akeem tagged in and dumped Jannetty. Michaels came off the top on Akeem but Boss Man powerbombed him. Akeem took {{advantage}} and hit Michaels with an <b>Air</b> Africa and <b>pinned</b> him to win the match.|$|R
