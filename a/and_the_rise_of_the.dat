5|$|The Byzantine–Ottoman wars were {{a series}} of decisive {{conflicts}} between the Ottoman Turks and Byzantines {{that led to the}} final destruction of the Byzantine Empire <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Under Theodosius I (15211522) the Ottoman {{governor}} of Nicopolis {{take advantage of}} the internal fights among the boyar parties, and thus dominated the political life of Wallachia. Due to the imminent danger of annexation, the boyars grouped around Radu V of Afumaţi (15221529) who fought about 20 battles against the Ottomans. Finally, he was, in 1525, forced to accept Ottoman suzerainty <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tribute.|$|E

5|$|American {{historian}} Richard Landes, {{who specializes}} {{in the history of}} apocalypticism and was co-founder and director of the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University, argues that new and emerging technologies often trigger alarmism among millenarians and even the introduction of Gutenberg's printing press in 1436 caused waves of apocalyptic thinking. The Year 2000 problem, bar codes and Social Security numbers all triggered end-time warnings which either proved to be false or simply were no longer taken seriously once the public became accustomed to these technological changes. Civil libertarians argue that the privatization of surveillance <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surveillance-industrial complex in the United States does raise legitimate concerns about the erosion of privacy. However, skeptics of mass surveillance conspiracism caution that such concerns should be disentangled from secular paranoia about Big Brother or religious hysteria about the Antichrist.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the {{majority}} of women were still wearing highly structured undergarments. Girdles were considered the ladylike norm and represented close to 40% of industry sales by volume. The 1960s also brought to Canadian Lady the challenges of feminism, fashions and the sexual revolution. The feminist movement—cultured by thought leaders like Betty Friedan and Germaine Greer—questioned the mores that defined women's roles and appearance. Changes in fashion trends, such as pantyhose <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> miniskirt, rendered the girdle unattractive and obsolete to a generation of women. While the intimate apparel industry fretted about bra-burning as a precursor to the decline of all foundation garment sales, women reserved their animosity for their girdles. The Canadian sales data for foundation undergarments, from 1960 to 1971, vividly demonstrates the shift in tastes.|$|E
5|$|Ireland– February 2011– After a high {{deficit in}} the government's budget in 2010 and the {{uncertainty}} surrounding the proposed bailout from the International Monetary Fund, the 30th Dáil (parliament) collapsed the following year, {{which led to a}} subsequent general election, collapse of the preceding government parties, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party, the resignation of the Taoiseach Brian Cowen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fine Gael party, which formed a government alongside the Labour Party in the 31st Dáil, which led to a change of government and the appointment of Enda Kenny as Taoiseach.|$|E

5|$|Livingstone {{continued}} {{his association with}} members of Trotskyite group Socialist Action, with the group's leader John Ross became his most important adviser, teaching him about economics. Investing in an advanced £25,000 computer, he and Ross used the machine to undertake complex economic analysis, {{on the basis of}} which they began publishing the Socialist Economic Bulletin in 1990. Two other members of the group, Redmond O'Neill and Simon Fletcher, also became trusted advisers. When Socialist Action founded a campaign group, the Anti-Racist Alliance, Livingstone came to be closely associated with it. They campaigned on the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> far right British National Party, but were disadvantaged by an ongoing rivalry with the Anti-Nazi League.|$|E
5|$|Over the 18th and 19th centuries, {{biological}} sciences such as botany and zoology became increasingly professional scientific disciplines. Lavoisier and other physical scientists began {{to connect the}} animate and inanimate worlds through physics and chemistry. Explorer-naturalists such as Alexander von Humboldt investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography—laying the foundations for biogeography, ecology and ethology. Naturalists began to reject essentialism and consider the importance of extinction and the mutability of species. Cell theory provided {{a new perspective on}} the fundamental basis of life. These developments, as well as the results from embryology and paleontology, were synthesized in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of spontaneous generation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> germ theory of disease, though the mechanism of inheritance remained a mystery.|$|E

He also edited L.A.

5|$|Preservation of {{elements}} of Portland's industrial laundry era, {{and its relation}} to the women’s labor movement <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle class in the United States, are factors in the building's listing on the National Register. Built and first operated by businessman Charles F. Brown, the building was bought in 1927 by Home Services Company, a power-laundry consortium. American Linen Supply and then Perfect Fit Manufacturing, a maker of automotive fabrics, used the building after Home Services sold it in 1950. Acquired by Alter LLC in 2008, the building is home to Yale Union (YU), a contemporary arts center.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{was divided}} {{into a series of}} kingdoms in the early Middle Ages, i.e. between the end of Roman {{authority}} in southern and central Britain from around 400 CE <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kingdom of Alba in 900 CE. Of these, the four most important to emerge were the Picts, the Scots of Dál Riata, the Britons of Alt Clut, and the Anglian kingdom of Bernicia. After the arrival of the Vikings in the late 8th century, Scandinavian rulers and colonies were established on the islands and along parts of the coasts. In the 9th century, the House of Alpin combined the lands of the Scots and Picts to form a single kingdom which constituted the basis of the kingdom of Scotland.|$|E

5|$|The Serjeants only enjoyed their {{returned}} {{status for}} another six years, however, before Parliament intervened. The Practitioners in Common Pleas Act 1846, from 18 August 1846, allowed all barristers {{to practice in}} the Court of Common Pleas. The next and final blow was the Judicature Act 1873, which came into force on 1 November 1875. Section 8 provided that common law judges need no longer be appointed from the Serjeants-at-Law, removing the need to appoint judicial Serjeants. With this Act <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen's Counsel, {{there was no longer}} any need to appoint Serjeants, and the practice ended.|$|E
5|$|The mandate was {{dissolved}} in 1946 {{because of a}} British ultimatum to France, and Syria became an independent country on 17 April 1946. The same elite that had governed Syria during the mandate continued in power and they governed in the same manner. The failure in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War led to {{the downfall of the}} traditional elite <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military in politics. Husni al-Za'im became the first military dictator of Syria in 1949, but in 1950, military officer Adib Shishakli gained power behind the scenes, and by 1953 had established another military dictatorship. The military's introduction to the Syrian political scene destroyed the oligarchy enabling the middle class to participate in Syrian politics. However, while their powers were weakened, the traditional elite retained the majority of the wealth produced.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} spawned {{perhaps a}} thousand metal bands, {{but only a}} few survived the advent of MTV <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more commercial glam metal {{in the second half of}} the 1980s. Among them, Iron Maiden and Def Leppard became international stars, and Motörhead and Saxon had considerable success. Other groups, such as Diamond Head, Venom and Raven, remained underground, but were a major influence on the successful extreme metal subgenres of the late 1980s and 1990s. Many bands from the NWOBHM reunited in the 2000s and remained active through live performances and new studio albums.|$|E
