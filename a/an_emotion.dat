40|$|This {{research}} {{examines how}} media-induced consumer activation level affects consumer response to highly energetic commercials. Over six studies, including a Hulu field experiment, the authors report that consumers who are experiencing <b>a</b> deactivating <b>emotion</b> (e. g., sadness induced by a movie) {{find it more}} difficult to watch highly energetic commercials compared with consumers who are not experiencing <b>a</b> deactivating <b>emotion.</b> <b>As</b> a result, consumers experiencing <b>a</b> deactivating <b>emotion</b> are less likely to watch highly energetic commercials and recall the advertiser compared with consumers who are not experiencing <b>a</b> deactivating <b>emotion.</b> The authors do not observe these effects when consumers experiencing <b>a</b> deactivating <b>emotion</b> watch commercials that are moderately energetic or when consumers do not experience <b>a</b> deactivating <b>emotion.</b> These findings suggest that when advertisers run commercials in a media context that induces <b>a</b> deactivating <b>emotion</b> (e. g., sadness, relaxation, contentment), they should avoid running highly energetic commercials (e. g., with upbeat, enthusiastic spokespeople). In addition, this research recommends that when advertisers are unable to determine the emotions induced by the media context, they should run commercials that are moderate in energy. The results of a metaanalysis across the present studies show that consumers experiencing <b>a</b> deactivating <b>emotion</b> will respond as much as 50 % more favorably to moderately energetic commercials compared with highly energetic commercials...|$|R

This system produces unique and often remarkably musical selections that tend to match <b>a</b> target <b>emotion,</b> performing this task {{at a level that}} approaches human competency for the same task. ...|$|R

25|$|Emotions {{are complex}} and involve a variety of {{physical}} and cognitive responses, {{many of which are}} not well understood. The general purpose of emotions is to produce a specific response to a stimulus.

25|$|The first {{empirical}} research {{about the social}} sharing of emotions was conducted in 1991.

In all of these studies, 88–96% of emotional experiences were followed by social sharing of those experiences at least one time.|$|E

40|$|How do {{you feel}} when you drop something? While {{previous}} research centering on the embodiment perspective has investigated such components as body parts in verb meaning, this study seeks to describe the systematic relation between 102 verbs and emotions. The first survey asked undergraduates to connect 102 early-learned verbs and 7 basic emotions (joy, love, anger, etc). The second survey asked 3 -to 5 -year-olds to connect the same verbs with 5 everyday emotional words (happy, sad, etc). At a threshold of 50 % agreement, 64 % of the verbs were associated with <b>a</b> single <b>emotion</b> and 38. 4 % with <b>a</b> pair of <b>emotions</b> in adults.

25|$|From {{the above}} {{evidence}} {{it can be}} concluded that exposure to the social sharing of <b>an</b> <b>emotion</b> is itself an emotion-eliciting event, it would follow that the listener too would later share that experience with other people. Christophe et Rimé called this subsequent phenomenon secondary social sharing of emotions. In other words, the receiver of the social sharing will consequently experience some kind of emotion, so the receiver will then become a transmitter of the narration as a part of their emotional experience of hearing the story.|$|E
25|$|Spinoza's {{philosophy}} has {{much in common}} with Stoicism inasmuch as both philosophies sought to fulfil a therapeutic role by instructing people how to attain happiness. However, Spinoza differed sharply from the Stoics in one important respect: he utterly rejected their contention that reason could defeat emotion. On the contrary, he contended, <b>an</b> <b>emotion</b> can only be displaced or overcome by a stronger emotion. For him, the crucial distinction was between active and passive emotions, the former being those that are rationally understood and the latter those that are not. He also held that knowledge of true causes of passive emotion can transform it to an active emotion, thus anticipating one of the key ideas of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis.|$|E
25|$|The Gospel of John {{focuses on}} God's glory in {{his use of}} light imagery and in his {{presentation}} of the Cross as a moment of exaltation; he also sees the Cross as the example of agape love, a love which {{is not so much}} <b>an</b> <b>emotion</b> as a willingness to serve and care for others. But in stressing love, John shifts the goal of spiritual growth away from knowledge/gnosis, which he presents more in terms of Stoic ideas about the role of reason as being the underlying principle of the universe and as the spiritual principle within all people. Although John does not follow up on the Stoic notion that this principle makes union with the divine possible for humanity, it is an idea that later Christian writers develop. Later generations will also shift back and forth between whether to follow the Synoptics in stressing knowledge or John in stressing love.|$|E

25|$|The final affective {{response}} or emotion seen in initial infidelity is anger (Johnson, 2017). Anger is <b>an</b> <b>emotion</b> that is felt in {{all stages}} of infidelity, but in different ways and at different calibers. In {{the initial stages of}} infidelity anger is an underlying emotion that is usually exposed after the buildup of other emotions such as jealousy and resentment. When a partner is suspicious of another’s intentions and actions they become frustrated with that partner and tend to get angry at them more easily and feel that the anger is not anticipated. In turn, the suspected unfaithful partner will be confused and become angry at the other starting fight. Anger is noticed to be a key emotion within a situation like infidelity, it takes on many roles and forms throughout the process but in the initial stage of cheating anger can be an affective emotion because of how unpredictable and rapid it can happen without thinking of one’s actions and feelings before doing so.|$|E
25|$|A growing {{literature}} is demonstrating {{the importance of}} emotion regulation {{in the treatment of}} substance abuse. Considering that nicotine and other psychoactive substances such as cocaine activate similar psychopharmacological pathways, <b>an</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation approach may be applicable to a wide array of substance abuse. Proposed models of affect-driven tobacco use have focused on negative reinforcement as the primary driving force for addiction; according to such theories, tobacco is used because it helps one escape from the undesirable effects of nicotine withdrawal or other negative moods. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), is showing evidence that it is effective in treating substance abuse, including the treatment of poly-substance abuse and cigarette smoking. Mindfulness programs that encourage patients to be aware of their own experiences in the present moment and of emotions that arise from thoughts, appear to prevent impulsive/compulsive responses. Research also indicates that mindfulness programs can reduce the consumption of substances such as alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana, cigarettes and opiates.|$|E
25|$|Festinger’s other {{well-known}} {{theory of}} cognitive dissonance, proposed in 1957 offers further evidence for {{why such a}} process might occur. Because emotional experiences are unexpected, they can affect one’s self-concept and thus challenge one’s system of beliefs. According to Festinger, when people’s expectations do not manifest themselves, a cognitive dissonance is created between the expectations and reality and people seek to reduce this dissonance by rationalizing the discrepancy. So after experiencing <b>an</b> <b>emotion,</b> people {{would be expected to}} communicate the event with others in order to help reduce their cognitive dissonance. An article by Thoits emphasizes the importance of the ability of others to assist in the process of coping. Other people are able to offer new perspectives on interpretations of the emotional event. In previous studies, Rimé concluded that emotions necessitate “cognitive articulation” because of their dense, complex nature. By using language to express an experience, people are forced to classify and organize the contents of the emotions, and furthermore can concretize and objectivize the experience into a script that can be more easily understood.|$|E
