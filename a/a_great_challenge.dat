5|$|The game's {{music is}} {{composed}} by Borislav Slavov and Peter Antovszki, Crytek's in-house composers. Slavov had previously led the soundtrack development of Crysis 3 and Warface. The soundtrack development began in February 2013, {{right after the}} completion of Crysis 3. Slavov considered composing the music for Ryse <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>challenge,</b> as he had to compose 250 minutes of music within a short time frame. Crytek also hired an external composer, Tilman Silescu, to help compose the music for the game.|$|E
5|$|Jefferson Davis {{served in}} many roles. As a soldier, he was brave and resourceful. As a politician, {{he served as}} a United States senator and a Mississippi congressman and was active and accomplished, {{although}} he never completed a full term in any elected position. As a plantation owner, he employed slave labor as did most of his peers in the South, and supported slavery. As president of the Confederate States of America, he is widely viewed as an ineffective wartime leader; although the task of defending the Confederacy against the much stronger Union would have been <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>challenge</b> for any leader, Davis's performance in this role is considered poor. After the war, he contributed to reconciliation of the South with the North, but remained a symbol for Southern pride.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{the beam}} intensities at superheavy element {{facilities}} result in about 1012 projectiles hitting the target per second; this cannot be increased without burning {{the target and}} the detector, and producing larger amounts of the increasingly unstable actinides needed for the target is impractical. The team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna is building a new superheavy element factory (SHE-factory) with improved detectors {{and the ability to}} work on a smaller scale, but even so continuing beyond element 120 and perhaps 121 would be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>challenge.</b> Krzysztof Rykaczewski, a professor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory which collaborates with Dubna on superheavy elements, has nevertheless predicted that in one generation element 124 would be reached. Chemist, writer, and philosopher of science Eric Scerri has noted that the development of new technologies in the field has been driven by the quest for new elements, so that the inability to proceed beyond elements 120 and 121 with current technologies may not necessarily cause a very long pause in new discoveries.|$|E

25|$|Many {{attempts}} have been made to analyze the disputed areas of The Play and resolve its controversies. This has proven to be a difficult task for several reasons. Only one television replay is available, and it is from a distant and elevated midfield camera. The rules of college football do not precisely cover The Play's bizarre final seconds. Finally, the intense passion from both Cal and Stanford fans often make objective analysis of The Play <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>challenge.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Raban was an {{engagement}} fought in autumn 958 near the fortress of Raban (in {{the north of}} modern Syria) between the Byzantine army, led by John Tzimiskes (later emperor in 969–976), and {{the forces of the}} Hamdanid Emirate of Aleppo under the famed emir Sayf al-Dawla (r. 945–967). The battle was a major victory for the Byzantines, and contributed to the demise of Hamdanid military power, which in the early 950s had proven <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>challenge</b> to Byzantium.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>great</b> <b>challenge</b> {{in visual}} {{recognition}} tasks {{is that the}} same object can be seen in a variety of conditions. It can be seen from different distances, different viewpoints, under different lighting, partially occluded, etc. In addition, for particular classes objects, such as faces, highly complex specific transformations may be relevant, such as changing facial expressions. For learning to recognize images, it is greatly beneficial to factor out these variations. It results in much simpler classification problem and, consequently, in great reduction of sample complexity of the model.|$|E

25|$|In 1866, citing {{excessive}} costs, the Portuguese government {{withdrew the}} garrison. Pedro continued his rule, however, though he faced increasing rivalry from clan-based trading magnates who drained his authority from {{much of the}} country. The most dangerous of these was Garcia Mbwaka Matu {{of the town of}} Makuta. This town had been founded by a man named Kuvo, who probably obtained his wealth through trade, since he and Garcia made a great deal of controlling markets. Though this was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>challenge</b> in the 1870s, after Garcia's death in 1880, Makuta became less problematic.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, Truffaut {{directed}} his third movie, Jules and Jim, a romantic drama starring Jeanne Moreau. Over the next decade, Truffaut had {{varying degrees of}} success with his films. In 1963, Truffaut was approached to direct an American film called Bonnie and Clyde, with a treatment written by Esquire journalists, David Newman and Robert Benton intended to introduce the French New Wave to Hollywood. Although he was interested enough to help in script development, Truffaut ultimately declined, but not before interesting Jean-Luc Godard and American actor and would be producer, Warren Beatty, the latter of whom proceeded with the film with director Arthur Penn. As for Truffaut, his first non-French film was an 1966 adaptation of Ray Bradbury's classic science fiction novel Fahrenheit 451, showcasing Truffaut's love of books. His only English-speaking film was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>challenge</b> for Truffaut, because he barely spoke English himself. This was also his first film shot in color. The larger scale production was difficult for Truffaut, who had worked only with small crews and budgets.|$|E
25|$|Participating in inter-faculty {{competitions}} {{in different}} fields of {{practice at the}} national and international level is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>challenge</b> to students. The student teams are coached by professors and teaching assistants, and they have achieved notable success in the past. Apart from national competitions in various fields, {{for a number of}} years the Faculty of Law has enabled its students to participate in international competitions, such as the William C. Vis International Commercial Arbitration Moot (in international commercial and arbitration Law), Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition (in international public law), Jean Pictet International Humanitarian Law Moot (in international humanitarian law), Clinical Legal History Competition (simulation of a court proceeding in ancient Athens), etc. Regarding Willem C. Vis Moot, since 2008, University of Belgrade Faculty of Law hosts an annual pre-moot competition better known as Belgrade Open. In 2010, 22 teams from 16 countries participated. Actual pre-moot rounds of Belgrade Open are, since 2009, preceded by an arbitration conference dealing with issues which were brought upon in that year's moot problem. In 2011, the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law team triumphed at the Monroe E. Price International Media Law Moot Court Competition at the University of Oxford.|$|E

500|$|Vincent Price as Matthew Hopkins. Decidedly not Michael Reeves's {{choice for}} the part, this was the veteran horror star's 75th film and his 17th for American International Pictures. Some of the {{performances}} he provided for his previous AIP movies had certain elements of campy overacting, but in Witchfinder he was subtle and deadly serious. The role was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>challenge</b> for Price, as his frequent clashes with Reeves left him unsure {{as to what the}} director wanted (see [...] "Filming" [...] section below).

500|$|Considered {{rare for}} Disney animals, Pascal and Maximus do not speak. The idea to make Pascal and Maximus mute was {{inspired}} by the performances of actors Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton in Silent films. Identifying themselves as [...] "huge fans" [...] of Chaplin, Greno and Howard suggested {{that it would be a}} good idea to have a character like the actor featured in the film. Additionally, the directors explained in an interview with Orange that Pascal and Maximus' silence was also inspired by the roles of Princess Aurora's animal friends in Disney's Sleeping Beauty (1959), following the film's rules and guidelines that even though they do not talk, they remain [...] "very expressive" [...] nonetheless and [...] "act and understand without words." [...] Maximus particularly [...] "belongs to the grand tradition of Disney creatures that are full of personality even though they don't talk." [...] One film critic observed that Pascal and Maximus [...] "have personalities all their own, making use of techniques harkening back to the silent era". Howard explained that [...] "Pantomime acting is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>challenge</b> for our animators" [...] because, according to animator Jin Kim, Pascal and Maximus both [...] "had to be funny without speech", forcing the animators to exaggerate their emotions and facial expressions. The Chicago Sun-Times observed that [...] "Pascal ... doesn't speak, but manages to convey himself with eye rolls and changes of color." [...] Both animals' sound effects are provided by American actor Frank Welker.|$|E
