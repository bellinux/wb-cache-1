40|$|A simple {{technique}} for decoding an unknown modulated chaotic time-series is presented. We point out that, by fitting a polynomial {{model to the}} <b>modulated</b> chaotic <b>signal,</b> the error in the fit gives sufficient information to decode the <b>modulating</b> <b>signal.</b> For analog implementation, a lowpass filter {{can be used for}} fitting. This method is simple and easy to implement in hardware. Indexing terms: chaotic time-series, secure communication (PACS: 05. 45). Secure communication using chaos has received much attention recently. Various methods for modulating and demodulating a chaotic oscillator have been proposed (see [1] and references cited in [2]). There are two ways to hide the <b>modulating</b> <b>signal</b> inside the chaotic carrier signal. One way is to add a small <b>modulating</b> <b>signal</b> to the chaotic carrier signal whose amplitude is much larger. This is called chaotic masking. In this case, power is wasted in the carrier. Another way to encode the <b>modulating</b> <b>signal</b> is to <b>modulate</b> the parameters of the carrier chaotic oscillator. This method has been demonstrated experimentally by many groups[2]. However, it has also been pointed out that secure communication using chaos can be broken ([3],[4]). The first method in [3] is specific to the Lorenz oscillator case. The second method by Short[4] is more general. In this approach by Short, the <b>modulating</b> <b>signal</b> i...|$|R

30|$|The {{correlation}} between the input and feedback signal is performed on a <b>modulated</b> <b>signal</b> that precedes the training signal because the gain compression of the amplifier makes {{the accuracy of the}} correlation over the training signal suspect. In addition, because the envelope of the <b>modulated</b> <b>signal</b> will typically have a PDF such that it spends much of its time within the linear operating region of the amplifier, correlation using the <b>modulated</b> <b>signal</b> becomes more reliable. However, because the <b>modulated</b> <b>signal</b> is stochastic, the statistics of the <b>modulated</b> <b>signal,</b> as well as the size of the data block over which the correlation operation is performed will impact the accuracy of the delay estimation. In general, the accuracy of the estimation improves as the block size increases. Unfortunately, a larger block size requires more memory and takes longer to perform the estimate. The predistortion function cannot be exactly determined following the transmission of single training ramp and recalculation of the LUT coefficients thereafter. A series of training ramps will have to be transmitted. Although significant improvement in the ACPR of the amplifier should be observed even after a single training ramp, yet simulations have shown that the predistortion function can converge to a solution after only six training ramps.|$|R
40|$|Regularly sampled {{pulse width}} {{modulation}} (PWM) has been a mainstay of the power electronics community {{since the advent of}} digital controllers. In this form of PWM the <b>modulating</b> <b>signal</b> is sampled only at either the peaks and/or the troughs of the triangular carrier waveform, then held constant until the next sampling instant, which allows ample time for the calculation of switching instants. Unfortunately, it produces phase and amplitude distortion of the <b>modulating</b> <b>signal</b> that can be significant at low pulse numbers. In applications where the desired <b>modulating</b> <b>signal</b> is not known a priori, this phase delay can become a critical limitation. The analogue alternative to regular sampling is naturally sampled PWM, where the <b>modulating</b> <b>signal</b> is permitted to vary as a continuous waveform. This form of PWM does not apply any phase or amplitude distortion to the <b>modulating</b> <b>signal.</b> True natural sampling is, however, impossible to implement on the digital control platforms that are used in modern power electronics applications. In this paper, a type of hold circuit known as a First-Order Hold (FOH) circuit is used in conjunction with the technique known as resampled regular PWM to improve upon the limitations of regular sampling. It is found that this augmentation to the PWM strategy improves both the linearity and phase delay of the modulator as well as (for high pulse numbers) harmonic performance. The FOH circuit has an overshoot in its transfer function which should be avoidable if the <b>modulating</b> <b>signal</b> is sampled at a sufficiently high rate...|$|R
