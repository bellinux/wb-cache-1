500|$|When visiting Venice in 1978, Gould {{noted that}} the {{spandrels}} of the San Marco cathedral, while quite beautiful, were not spaces planned by the architect. Rather the spaces arise as [...] "necessary architectural byproducts of mounting a dome on rounded arches." [...] Gould and Lewontin thus defined [...] "spandrels" [...] in the evolutionary biology context to mean any biological feature of an organism that arises as a necessary side consequence of other features, which is not directly selected for by natural selection. Proposed examples include the [...] "masculinized genitalia in female hyenas, exaptive use of <b>an</b> <b>umbilicus</b> as a brooding chamber by snails, the shoulder hump of the giant Irish deer, and several key features of human mentality." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rotalinidae - have simple chamber interiors, <b>an</b> <b>umbilicus</b> partly {{covered by}} chamber {{extensions}} or closed, and an aperutre {{that is a}} low interiomarginal arch. Gavellinopsis, Nevconorbina, Rosalina ...|$|E

5000|$|A phaneromphalous shell has <b>an</b> open <b>{{umbilicus}}.</b> <b>A</b> cryptomphalous shell has {{the opening}} of the umbilicus completely plugged.|$|R
50|$|This genus {{differs from}} the other genera in the family Calliostomatidae by several characteristics: the {{conspicuous}} spiral whorls, obvious sculpture, <b>an</b> open <b>umbilicus,</b> <b>a</b> thin shell and external iridescence.|$|R
50|$|The {{shell of}} species within this family varies from planispiral to needle-shaped. The shell may have <b>an</b> open <b>umbilicus</b> or <b>a</b> plugged <b>umbilicus.</b> The {{thickness}} of the shell can vary from thin to fairly solid. The shell may be transparent and horn-colored, or colorless.|$|R
50|$|The {{shell of}} species in this genus {{is more or}} less transparent, subdepressed and {{contains}} <b>an</b> <b>umbilicus.</b> The aperture is semilunar and usually lacks teeth. The outer lip is thin and sharp.|$|E
50|$|The {{specimens}} {{from the}} surroundings of Barbosa and Moniquira {{differ from those}} from near Villa de Leyva in the smaller shell with more strongly arched whorls, a weaker spiral sculpture on the protoconch and <b>an</b> <b>umbilicus</b> that is on average narrower.|$|E
5000|$|<b>An</b> <b>umbilicus</b> {{can vary}} from very narrow and punctured, as found in Petasina unidentata, to wide and shallow, such as the deep and wide {{depression}} in the rounded snail (Discus rotundatus). Shells with a conspicuous umbilicus are always orthostylic, i.e. they have a poorly developed columella.|$|E
50|$|The {{shell of}} Hyperlioceras is very {{compressed}} and involute, {{with a tall}} persistent keel and <b>a</b> deep <b>umbilicus.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{shell of}} this species is {{globular}} with <b>a</b> deep <b>umbilicus.</b> The shell color is whitish or brownish.|$|R
50|$|The nacreous, white {{shell is}} {{somewhat}} broader (2.45 mm) than high (2.1 mm). The thick shell has <b>a</b> narrow <b>umbilicus.</b>|$|R
50|$|Paraphaeosphaeria michotii has {{a rather}} similar {{morphology}} to P. pilleata, {{but can be}} distinguished microscopically {{by the lack of}} both <b>an</b> <b>umbilicus</b> and an evanescent cap on the tips of the asci. Additionally, P. michotti has narrower ascomata (up to 250 μm wide), a thinner peridium (16 μm), and branched pseudoparaphyses.|$|E
50|$|The {{shell of}} Falcitornoceras is {{strongly}} involute, lacking <b>an</b> <b>umbilicus.</b> Juvenile stages have falcate ribs which cross the ventral rim; the ventro-lateral area bears weak to strong furrows. The adventitious lobe, {{high on the}} flank, is rounded or subacute and the lateral lobe has an inconspicuous saddle at the umbilical seam.|$|E
50|$|Snails in this genus are {{characterized}} by their relatively large, silky-white, thin shell. They lack <b>an</b> <b>umbilicus.</b> Their spiral whorls are flat to slightly convex. The first three spiral cords can show some sculpture that may persist on later whorls. They have a rachidian radula. They can be found worldwide in deep water.|$|E
50|$|Gundolficeras {{differs from}} its partly contemporary, but {{slightly}} older relative Falcitornoceras {{in the details}} of the suture and in sometimes having <b>an</b> open <b>umbilicus.</b>|$|R
50|$|This genus {{was founded}} by S. Wood for an English fossil trochid, conical in form, with tubular whorls and <b>a</b> deep <b>umbilicus,</b> its margin crenulated.|$|R
40|$|The {{umbilicus}} {{is essential}} to the aesthetic appearance of the abdomen. However, little research exists on what characterizes <b>an</b> aesthetically pleasing <b>umbilicus.</b> Often, the plastic surgeon is called on to reconstruct the umbi-licus. Although a variety of reconstructive methods are available, no real standards define the appearance of <b>an</b> aesthetically pleasing <b>umbilicus.</b> To ascertain the charac-teristics of <b>an</b> aesthetically pleasing <b>umbilicus,</b> <b>a</b> photo-graphic analysis was undertaken using 147 female partic-ipants between the ages of 18 and 62 years. Each subject’s age, height, and weight were recorded. Photographs of each participant’s umbilicus were then taken from 30 cm and 50 cm away. The photographs were reviewed by the authors, and each umbilicus was catego-rized on the basis of size, shape, hooding, or protrusion...|$|R
50|$|The Calliostomatidae are unusually diverse. They are {{characterized}} by a stepped spire and a pointy aperture. They may possess or lack <b>an</b> <b>umbilicus.</b> The columella is sometimes thicker, partially covering the aperture. The spiral whorls can differ between narrow and robust. They inhabit {{a wide range of}} ocean habitats, from the intertidal zone to mid-bathyal depths.|$|E
50|$|The {{species in}} Syrnola are medium sized and slender. Their shell is subulate and polished, marked by fine lines {{of growth and}} {{microscopic}} spiralstriations.

The outer lip is simple.They possess only one columellar fold.|$|E
50|$|The {{shells of}} species in this {{subfamily}} are mostly low-spired, subglobose, with few whorls. They are either Haliotis-shaped or non-spiral and limpet-like. They lack <b>an</b> <b>umbilicus.</b> Most species lack an operculum. The aperture is very arge, {{and through it}} {{the interior of the}} last whorl is entirely visible from below. The interior of the shell is iridescent because of a layer of nacre. The muscle impression inside the shell is crescent-shaped.|$|E
5000|$|Frogdenites has an evolute {{globular}} shell with <b>a</b> deep <b>umbilicus</b> {{and covered}} by bifurcating ribs that cross the venter, the outer {{rim of the}} shell, without interruption.|$|R
5000|$|Assiminea nitida (Pease, 1865): {{this species}} {{belongs to the}} genus Paludinella as has been {{demonstrated}} by Thiele (1927, p. 128), because of a different dentition and <b>an</b> open <b>umbilicus</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Most {{species in}} this family are small, usually up to 10 mm. They show a diverse range of morphologies.The shell has a conical shape with rounded whorls and <b>a</b> wide <b>umbilicus.</b>|$|R
50|$|The size of {{an adult}} shell of Littoraria scabra varies between 15 mm and 40 mm. These shells are ovate-conical, without <b>an</b> <b>umbilicus.</b> The outer surface shows a spiral {{sculpture}} without nodules, with a pattern of irregular dark stripes. As in other bark-living snail species the shell color is brown. The mouth is rounded and the radula quite long, in order {{to adapt to the}} surface or the bark.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shell is}} broadly ovate, thick, and sharply pointed except when eroded. [...] The shell {{contains}} {{six to seven}} whorls with some fine threads and wrinkles. The color is variable from grayish to gray-brown, often with dark spiral bands. The base of the columella is white.

5000|$|The {{shell of}} this species is globose, ovate, and has <b>an</b> <b>umbilicus.</b> The shell color is white with 3 pink lines running along {{the surface of the}} body whorl, the middle line being twice the width of the other two. The shell also has 7 pinkish axial lines, but they are more diffuse. The spire is {{relatively}} low, approximately 1/9 of the shell height, with a large protoconch, and rounded whorls.|$|E
50|$|Kosmoceras jason has a {{shell that}} reaches a size of about 10 cm. These ammonites {{have a very}} {{compressed}} section and <b>a</b> narrow <b>umbilicus</b> on phragmocone. Ornamentation is fine and dense.|$|R
50|$|The size of {{the shell}} of species in this genus is small to moderate. The {{iridescent}} shell is thin and contains <b>a</b> conspicuous <b>umbilicus.</b> Its sculpture shows spiral rows with many tubercles.|$|R
5000|$|Opheletinae, Knight,1956 - {{generally}} low spired with <b>a</b> wide <b>umbilicus</b> and V-shaped labral sinus {{ending at}} the periphery {{in a short}} notch that generates an obscure selenizone. U Camb - L Ord ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{size of the}} {{elongated}} shell varies between 2.8 mm and 3.1 mm. The {{conical shell}} lacks a spiral microstructure. The teleoconch consists of eight to nine rather low whorls with a clearly marked horizontal suture.The growthlines vary between orthocline (at right angles to the growth direction) and opisthocline (following the growth direction). The outer lip contains some teeth. <b>An</b> <b>umbilicus</b> is lacking. The columella shows a fold.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species is}} similar to Eulimella cerullii (Cossmann, 1916). The size of the slender, conical shell varies between 3.5 mm and 4.3 mm. The teleoconch {{contains}} six to seven rather flat whorls with a deep suture between them. The growthlines, shaped like an inverted S, are at about right angles to the growth direction. The aperture is oval. The shell lacks <b>an</b> <b>umbilicus</b> and has a noticeable fold on the columella.|$|E
50|$|Benthic {{gastropods}} {{were heavily}} preyed upon throughout the MMR, the weaker shelled types being {{pushed out of}} the benthic zone into more isolated habitats. The Palaeozoic archaeogastropods were subsequently replaced by neritaceans, mesogastropods and neogastropods. The former typically have symmetrical, umbilicate shells that are mechanically weaker than the latter. These lack <b>an</b> <b>umbilicus</b> and also developed the ability to modify the interior of their shells, allowing them to develop sculptures on their exterior to act as defence against predators.|$|E
50|$|Cadomites is {{directly}} descended from Stephanoceras, {{with a similar}} collared and lipped aperture rim, but has denser, finer, sharper ribbing. The shell is discoidal, evolute, with <b>a</b> wide <b>umbilicus.</b> The suture is complex.|$|R
50|$|The {{aperture}} is roundly ovate, {{slightly longer}} than broad and rounded anteriorly. The peristome is not continuous. The peristome is sharp, simple, slightly reflected near the columella, suggesting <b>a</b> faint <b>umbilicus.</b> The suture is slightly impressed.|$|R
5000|$|Oxydiscites is a genus of ammonites {{from the}} Upper Jurassic Kimmeridgian {{included}} in the Ochetoceratinae, Oppeliidae. The shell is involute, compressed, with <b>a</b> minute <b>umbilicus,</b> sharp venter with a tall finely toothed keel, and faloid ribbing.|$|R
