40|$|The current {{literature}} review presents data of adenoids hyperplasia and <b>adenotomy</b> {{effect on the}} children’s immunity and health. The presence of adenoid hyperplasia in a child was found to provide conditions for higher prevalence of severe respiratory pathology due to prolonged colonization by pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms {{against the background of}} morpho-functional rearrangement of mucosal immunity structures with its transient insufficiency. <b>Adenotomy</b> has a positive effect only as a means of eliminating mechanical obstructions to nasal breathing, without affecting other components of the pathological process in the nasopharynx of children with adenoid hyperplasia...|$|E

40|$|Breathing {{disorders}} {{which have}} their origin within the pharynx mainly occur during sleep. These so-called obstructive sleep-related breathing disorders include three different disturbances which {{have to be}} distinguished properly: simple snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Each disturbance requires a different treatment. Simple snoring {{does not affect the}} physical health of the snorer himself, but often leads to social problems due to the annoying character of the breathing sounds. Appropriate treatment modalities are oral devices and transcutaneous or ttransmucosal electrical stimulation of the muscles of the floor of the mouth via surface electrodes. As reconstructive surgical procedures <b>adenotomies,</b> tonsillectomies, tonsillotomies, or adenotonsillectomies are successfully used in children. Moreover, in adults radiofrequency treatments of the tonsils, the soft palate and of the base of tongue, as well as uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP) and palatal implants are adequate treatments for simple snoring. Adequate therapies for UARS and mild OSA (less than 20 breathing events per hour of sleep) are oral appliances. Nasal continuos positive airway pressure (NCPAP) ventilation is a very successful treatment modality, but shows low compliance in these patients, as daytime symptoms like excessive sleepiness or or impaired cognitive functions are often unincisive in patients with mild OSA. Reconstructive procedures like UPPP, radiofrequency surgery of the tonsils or the base of tongue, hyoid suspension, mandibular osteotomy with genioglossus advancement (MO) are successful treatment options either as isolated procedures or in combination within so-called multi-level surgery concepts. Goldstandard for the treatment of moderate to severe OSA is the nCPAP ventilation. All patients should at least try this treatment modality. Only in the rare cases of nCPAP failure (2 %) and in the relatively frequent cases of nCPAP incompliance (30 %) reconstructive surgical procedures become necessary as second choice treatments. These are adenectomies, tonsillectomies, tonsillotomies in children and hyoid suspension, MO, multi-level surgery concepts, or maxillomandibular advancement osteotomies in adults...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To analyse the {{incidence}} {{and timing of}} postoperative haemorrhage that requires re-operation following tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy, and to formulate a recommendation regarding the optimal duration of postoperative clinical observation. DESIGN: Retrospective. METHOD: Data were collected on {{the incidence}} of haemorrhage that required exploratory surgery in all patients who underwent <b>adenotomy</b> (n= 3508) or tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy (n= 4909) in the period 1996 - 2002 at the Sint Lucas Andreas Hospital in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The Sluder technique was used on an outpatient basis in 2439 of the 4909 patients who underwent tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy; these patients were aged or = 10 years and underwent conventional dissection followed by 24 hours of clinical observation before being discharged. RESULTS: Postoperative haemorrhage was recorded in 0 of the 3508 patients who underwent <b>adenotomy,</b> 12 (0. 5 %) of the 2439 patients aged or = 10 years who underwent conventional dissection. Of the 43 cases of haemorrhage after conventional dissection, 31 (75 %) occurred within 24 hours, including 2 cases that occurred between 12 and 24 hours (2 / 2470; 0. 08 %; 95 % CI: 0. 001 - 0. 29). CONCLUSION: Reducing the postoperative observation period from 24 hours to 12 hours would have unfavourable consequences in 1 (95 % CI: 0 - 3) per 1 ooo patients operated. In regard {{to the risk of}} postoperative haemorrhage, outpatient tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy appear to be justified for patients aged 10 years or over, provided that surgery is performed in the morning and the patient is observed in a ward that is open until the evenin...|$|E
40|$|A 4 -year-old girl {{presented}} with sleep-disordered breathing. Her parents described breathing pauses {{of up to}} 20 s and progressive tiredness during the day. Obstructive apneas from an enlarged adenoid {{were thought to be}} the most probable cause. However, an <b>adenotomy</b> did not resolve the problem. Polysomnography demonstrated central apneas, and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed a Chiari type I malformation. We describe the differential diagnosis of apnea in children and the role of polysomnography in the distinction between obstructive and central apneas. Conclusion: This case illustrates that, in children with apnea, {{it is important to consider}} central causes as well as the more common obstructive causes, even in the absence of additional neurological signs or symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Presented {{results of}} {{treatment}} efficacy research for topical fusafungin in patient with acute rhinosinusitis. 70 patients with acute rhinosinusitis aged 3 to 17 years were included into the study. All patients {{had been treated}} with fusafungin aerozole for 10 days. The results show that fusafungin is effective {{as a part of}} complex therapeutic schemes for treating subchronic rhinorhinosinusitis after <b>adenotomy</b> as well as in patients with rhinosinusitis and 1 – 2 stage adenoids. Patients with rhinosinusitis against the background of chronic adenoiditis had positive dynamics later on probably due to protracted inflammation and failure of a normal nasal drainage.

40|$|Aim. Study {{course of}} {{perioperative}} period after <b>adenotomy</b> in children {{in different ways}} of general anesthesia by examining indicators of heart rate variability and efficacy of postoperative analgesia. Materials and methods. To study included 70 children aged from 6 to 8 years, which was held <b>adenotomy.</b> Patients were divided into 3 groups: group I (n = 28) - operated under conditions of intravenous anesthesia based on propofol combined with fentanyl; group II (n= 23) – operated under conditions of inhalation anesthesia by sevoflurane in combination with fentanyl and analginum; group III (n= 19) – operated under conditions of intravenous anesthesia based on thiopental sodium combined with fentanyl. Differences were considered significant at p < 0. 05 using Student t-test. Results. Indicators of heart rate variability indicated that in the extubation stage in all groups of patients revealed high activity of the sympathetic tone with the trend of decline in the morning after surgery. Statistically higher activity of the sympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system was in patients of group III - 1 hour after surgery compared with patients groups I and II (p < 0, 001 and p < 0, 01, respectively). After 1 hour after surgery on the scales "Faces" and "Oucher" scores indicated that the child "a little hurt" in all groups of patients In the dynamics of observation in all groups tended to reduce the intensity of pain. An interpretation of scores on the FLACC scale indicated that patients in both groups felt comfortable. Conclusions. It was found that in patients in all groups there are changes in the nervous regulation of heart rate variability, characterized by increased activity of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system.

40|$|This trial {{studied the}} rate of {{contamination}} of mucous tunica of throat, nasopharyngeal and palatine tonsils with human papilloma viruses, type 6, 11, 16, 18, 31 and 33. 29 children with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) and 57 children hospitalized for planned <b>adenotomy,</b> tonsillotomy or tonsillectomy took part in this trial. Virus in bioptate from removed papillomas was discovered in 100 % of patients with RRP (type 6 and (or) 11 in all cases). Despite absence of clinical symptoms of throat papillomatosis, contamination of mucous tunic of throat was discovered in 48 % of patients in this group. Children without clinical signs of RRP had virus contamination of upper airways in 44 % cases. The rate of contamination of schoolchildren and younger children was comparable.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} the reliability, validity, and responsiveness {{of a new}} pain measure for children aged 1 to 4 years that was developed from the Children's Hospital of Ontario Pain Scale and its Neonatal Infant Pain Scale. Pain in 311 children, aged 1 to 4 years, was measured by two observers at fixed intervals after adenotonsillectomy (n = 114), <b>adenotomy</b> (n = 109), or insertion of ventilation tubes (grommets) (n = 88) until discharge using a dichotomous pain scale of 9 behavioral and physiological categories. The scale proved to be strongly homogeneous. The interobserver agreement was substantial for 7 items. On these final 7 items, the ability to distinguish between patients with differing degrees of pain and the sensitivity to detect changes over time within each patient were substantial. The resulting Pain Observation Scale for Young Children is reliable {{and easy to use}} for assessment of short- and longer-lasting pain after ear, nose, and throat surgery and may be used for assessing pain with other condition...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) in acromegaly in a retrospective analysis. Patients and methods: Thirty-four patients (17 females, median 43 years (range 30 - 74)) with acromegaly were treated with FSRT (conformal dynamic arcing, dose 54 Gy, 27 - 30 fractions) between January 1998 and April 2007. Thirty-two of the 34 patients had undergone transsphenoidal <b>adenotomy,</b> and 28 were on medical therapy before FSRT. Patients on medical therapy continued this {{during and after the}} irradiation. The treatment was gradually decreased/withdrawn after careful assessment. Results: MR scanning of the pituitary gland 34 months (median, range 11 - 95) after irradiation showed stable or reduced volume of the remaining tumour tissue in 31 of 34 patients (91 %). Seventeen patients (50 %) were biochemically controlled (normalised nadir growth hormone during OGTT and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF- 1) <+ 2 SD) 30 months after FSRT (median, range 6 - 60), ten of them had true biochemical remission (off medical therapy) 30 months after FSRT (median, range 12 - 69). Eight of 28 patients (29 %) with one or more functioning pituitary axes before irradiation developed further deficit of 1 or 2 pituitary axes 48 months (median, range 6 - 102) after FSRT.

40|$|Introduction: The authors {{report about}} the {{efficacy}} of inserted tympanostomy tube in children with serous otitis media. Aim: The aim of the authors {{was to assess the}} status of eardrum, the function of Eustachian tube and hearing level 10 years after the use of tympanostomy tube. Method: Patients filled up a questionnaire and microscopic examination of tympanic membrane, tympanometry, Eustachian tube function examination, and audiometry tests were performed. Results: In the period of 2003 - 2004, ventilation tube insertion was performed in 711 patients in the ENT Department of Pediatric Health Center of University of Szeged. In 349 patients <b>adenotomy</b> and tympanostomy tube insertion, in 18 cases tonsillectomy and grommet insertion and in 344 patients only typmanostomy tube insertion were performed. Due to objective difficulties (address change, no phone number) 453 patients were asked for control test and 312 persons accepted the invitation. Normal hearing level was found in 84. 6 % of patients and normal tympanometry result occurred in 82 %. Tympanic ventilation disorder, perforation of tympanic membrane, sensorineural hearing loss and sensorineural hearing loss due to noise exposure were diagnosed. Conclusions: Application of tympanostomy tube is effective in the treatment of serous otitis media resulting from ventilation disorder. The authors draw attention to the importance of tympanometry examination to prevent the adhesive processes and cholesteatoma in chronic ventilation disorder of the middle ear...|$|E
40|$|This study {{tries to}} prove the {{relation}} between the occurence of adenoid vegetation hypertrophy and allergies in children. In a group od 299 patients from the ages of 3 to 5, who were in the period from 1. 1. 2008 to 31. 12. 2008 at the Otolaryngological clinic FNKV given an <b>adenotomy,</b> there is evidence of the occurence of allergies, asthma and secretorial otitid. The occurence of allergies was confirmed among 104 children and occurence of recidivial otitid among 152 children. The most prevalent was respiratory alergy in 35, 6 % of the children and atopic eczema in 24 % of the children. The most common allergen was pollen in 52 %. Recurring secretorial otitid was present in 152 children, that is in 50. 8 % {{of the total number of}} children. Current occurence of allergies and secretorial otitid was confirmed in 17 % of children. On the whole allergies were found to be more prevalent in boys. I compared the data from my research with statistics from the State Medical Institute from the year 2006. Current life style, environment and prolonged pollen season contribute to the appearance of allergies. From the results of my research I proved that adenoid vegetation hypertrophy also contributes to the onset of allergies (SZÚ: prevalence of allergic children in the Czech Republic to the age of five is 27, 9 %, ORL FNKV: 34, 8 %).

40|$|Interventions of {{paediatric}} obstructive {{sleep apnea}} syndrome are complex, varied and multidisciplinary. The goal of the treatment is to restore optimal breathing during the night and to relieve associated symptoms. Evidence suggests that the surgical intervention with removal of the tonsils and adenoids will lead to significant improvements in the most incomplicated cases, as recently reported from a meta-analysis. However, post-operative persistence of this syndrome in paediatric population is more frequent than expected, which supports {{the idea of the}} complexity of this syndrome. <b>Adenotomy</b> alone may not be sufficient in children with OSAS, because it does not address oropharyngeal obstruction secondary to tonsillar hyperplasia. Continuous positive airway pressure can effectively treat this syndrome in selected groups of children, improving both nocturnal and daytime symptoms, but poor adherence is a limiting factor. For this reason, CPAP is not recommended as first-line therapy for OSAS when adenotonsillectomy is an option. It is now being investigated the incorporation of nonsurgical approaches for milder forms and for residual OSAS after surgical intervention. Althought adeno­tonsillar hypertrophy is the most common for OSAS in children; obesity is emerging as an equally important etiological factor. Therefore an intensive weight reduction program and adequate sleep hygiene are also important lifestyle changes that may be very effective in mitigating the symptoms of this syndrome. Pharmacological therapy (leukotriene antagonists, topical nasal steroids) is usually use for mild forms of OSAS and in children with associated allergic diseases. Special orthodontic treatment and oropharyngeal exercises are a relatively new and promising alternative therapeutic modality used in selected groups of children with OSAS...|$|E
40|$|Background: Recurrent {{upper airway}} infections in young {{children}} are a major concern of parents, general practitioners, ENT-surgeons and pediatricians. The current treatment is wait-and-see, tympanostomy tubes, <b>adenotomy</b> or tonsillectomy. Dietary nutrients are known important mediators of the immunological mechanism in children. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate whether a dietary advice of full-fat butter, whole milk, green vegetables, and beef, for at least three months, offers an advantage to the current treatment of recurrent respiratory tract infections in children aged between 1 and 6 years. Methods: 115 included children between the age of 1 and 6 years with recurrent upper airway infections are retrospectively subdivided in 4 groups: wait-and-see, dietary advice, surgical intervention and combination of surgical intervention and dietary advice. Average amount of days with symptoms of cold, fever, amount of antibiotics and general practitioner consultations are measured in a questionnaire at the moment of inclusion, and after a follow-up of 3 months after surgery or giving dietary advice. Results: Groups are retrospectively subdivided and differ for sexe, age and health history. Two of four groups are too small. The average reduction of days with cold-symptoms was 6, 3 in the group with combined treatment, compared to the surgery-group (p= 0, 016). In the groups without surgery there was a reduction of 1, 0 in treatment with antibiotics in the group with the dietary advice, compared to the group without intervention (p= 0, 039). In the groups that underwent surgery the reduction in treatment with antibiotics was 0, 2 in the group with combined treatment, compared to 1, 8 in the surgery-group (p= 0, 016). Conclusion: Due to methodological flaws, the research question cannot be answered. However, dietary interventions are a promising, simple and intervention with low costs and recurrent upper airway infections are a major concern. Therefore, it is important to investigate the effect of this dietary advice (full-butter, whole milk, green vegetables and beef) in a randomized trial with inclusion of more children. ...|$|E
