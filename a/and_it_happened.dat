It spent most of its 21-week chart time bubbling under 100 and 197. When released in the UK in November, it performed better, reaching number 9 of the UK Albums Chart. Critics and fans were generally underwhelmed by the album. Leaf wrote: [...] "By the time Smiley Smile {{was released}}... the Beach Boys had become cultural dinosaurs. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> almost overnight."

2500|$|Another {{case in the}} {{literature}} is Eugene Pauly, known as E.P., a severely amnesic patient (owing to viral encephalitis) {{who was able to}} learn three-word sentences. He performed better on consecutive tests over a 12-week period (24 study sessions). However, when asked how confident he was about the answers, his confidence did not appear to increase. Bayley and Squire proposed his learning was similar to the process required by procedural memory tasks; E.P. could not get the answers right when one word in the three-word sentence was changed or the order of words was changed, and his ability to answer correctly, thus, became more of a [...] "habit." [...] Bayley and Squire claim the learning may have happened in the neocortex, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> without the conscious knowledge of E.P. They hypothesized the information may be acquired directly by the neocortex (to which the hippocampus projects) when there is repetition. This case illustrates the difficulty in separating procedural from declarative tasks; this adds another dimension to the complexity of anterograde amnesia.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{subsequently}} started afresh {{in early}} 2012, returning to Droste's mother's home in Cape Cod, where the band had previously recorded its second studio album, Yellow House (2006). Commenting {{on the return}} to Yellow House, Droste noted, [...] "It's so funny that we went back there in the end. It's my grandmother's house, we know it, and we can use it for free. And {{as soon as we}} got there, things started happening. [...] We just sat by the fire, Dan strumming, me singing, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened.</b> Some of the best songs on the record, like [...] "Speak in Rounds" [...] and [...] "Half Gate", came out of that. We stayed there in isolation for two months straight." [...] Droste stated that he and Rossen decided to [...] "'try writing from the bottom up. We've never done it before.' There's a little bit of fear there because it's a new process we've never tried. We've never sat side by side and said, 'Let's literally, out of the ether, start writing songs together.' A couple of songs came that way, and that's why they're verse me, chorus Dan. [...] Suddenly the synergy hit, and the momentum struck, and then everyone got excited. And that's when the ball started to roll, and then we just started playing around, and people were much more open."" ...|$|E
2500|$|Several urban legends exist {{regarding}} the chariot sequence. One states that a stuntman died during filming. Stuntman Nosher Powell {{says in his}} autobiography, [...] "We had a stunt man killed in the third week, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> {{right in front of}} me. You saw it, too, because the cameras kept turning and it's in the movie." [...] But film historian Monica Silveira Cyrino discounted this statement in 2005, and said there were no published accounts of any serious injuries or deaths during filming of the chariot race. Indeed, the only recorded death to occur during the filming was that of producer Sam Zimbalist, who {{died of a heart attack}} at the age of 57 on November 4, 1958, while on the set. MGM executives asked Wyler to take over the executive producer's job, with an extra salary of $100,000. [...] Wyler agreed, although he had assistance from experienced MGM executives as well. Production supervisor Henry Henigson was so overcome by stress-related heart problems during the shoot that doctors feared for his life and ordered him off the set. Henigson, however, returned to the production shortly thereafter and did not die. [...] Nor were any horses injured during the shoot; in fact, the number of hours the horses could be used each day was actually shortened to keep them out of the summer heat.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{suspected}} {{ulterior motives}} in the media's reaction, expressing, [...] "It was just perfect timing to take people's focus off of other things. That's what happens, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> to me." [...] Accounts from several university leaders and management groups offered a similar premise. Michael Rich, director of Harvard's Center on Media and Child Health, exclaimed, [...] "Here we have Michael Powell {{upset about the}} happening in the Super Bowl, but the same Powell has been unwilling {{to do anything about}} the violence on television, where there has been much more research showing it has a harmful impact on kids." [...] Robert Thompson, founding director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, said, [...] "Michael Powell is representing the Super Bowl like everybody in the family sits around knitting booties, or like, it's the Macy's Day Parade. [...] Come on. There's gambling, there's a lot of drinking, partying, a carnival atmosphere", he asserted. Jay Rosenthal, attorney for the Recording Artists' Coalition, says the FCC's involvement was a smoke-screen, or a [...] "sound bite attempt" [...] by the Republican-led commission to act as if it's doing something. [...] "When it comes to media consolidation issues affecting consumers and artists, they don't care about that. But when it comes to indecency, after ignoring it for years, all of a sudden they're snapping to attention", he said. Simon Renshaw of management group The Firm stated it to be [...] "inappropriate" [...] that Powell is trying to distract people from the real issues of what's currently going on in the media. [...] "What I find offensive is CBS' refusal to carry MoveOn.org's ad during the Super Bowl", which pictured children working in factories to pay off the Bush administration's budget deficit. The Boston Legal episode [...] "Let Sales Ring" [...] likened the incident to being used as a distraction, portraying a news corporation which used the mishap to attract attention over other important events in the media. Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone explained, [...] "For the FCC, Nipplegate provided an opportunity to restore order and flex whatever power they had left. Faced with lax broadcast standards for cable TV and satellite radio, as well as the absolute lawlessness of the Internet, the FCC becomes hell-bent on preserving common decency in the family-friendly realm of network television. Thus, screws are tightened everywhere under the body's jurisdiction: Tape delays are lengthened and more frequent and sexually suggestive performances are replaced by less provocative selections. While the aftermath of Nipplegate starts to fade, the FCC will continue to carry its torch for the next half-decade." [...] Cynthia Fuchs of Popmatters stated, [...] "It behooves TV producers and consumers to focus their attentions on significant [...] "news", rather than the daily distractions offered up by politicians, performers, professional spinners, and journalists. Janet is not that person you watch on TV. And neither is anyone else." ...|$|E
