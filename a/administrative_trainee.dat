40|$|Conversation {{analysis}} {{has been used}} as a research method within a number of disciplinary areas to gain understanding of how work practices are constituted. These areas include medicine, law, education, journalism and international trade. However, currently, there appears to be little application of conversation analysis within the vocational education and training research literature. This paper is intended to begin to address this gap. Firstly, an overview of the basic principles relating to the analysis of conversation, as developed by Sacks (1992), and more recently applied, is presented. Secondly, several examples of the institutional talk integral to the role of level three <b>administrative</b> <b>trainees</b> is analaysed to show how this method can be an effective tool for researchers, trainers and assessors within the vocational education and training field...|$|R

40|$|The {{summer of}} 2012 has {{been filled with}} many memorable events and activities. As an intern, I had {{responsibilities}} {{that had to be}} fulfilled. My tour of duty was completed as an <b>administrative</b> student <b>trainee</b> in the Information Technology and Communications Services Business Office (IT-A). In accordance with the Business Objectives and Agreement of the Business Office and my performance plan, I was to provide business office support, improve business, project management, and technical work processes. With this being stated, I supported a project called "The Big Move Project" (TBMP), which will take course over the next several years. The Big Move Project is the planning of the Information Technology (IT) Directorate's relocation to various buildings in the course of upcoming years, when designs and the building of Central Campus have been completed. Working directly with my supervisor and the project manager, I was responsible for gathering both administrative and operational area requirements for the Information Technology (IT) Directorate, along with its outsourced support and contractors, such as IMCS, NICS, and ACES. My first action was to create rubrics that will serve as a guideline for the information that should be given by each branch of IT. After receiving that information via a few KAITS actions, I was able to start the consolidation process, and begin working on a presentation. A SharePoint was created shortly after for others to view the progression of the project, which I managed. During the consolidation ofthis information, I would occasionally present to the IT Deputy Director and IT Chiefs. The draft of this presentation was shown to employees of Center Operations (T A) and stakeholders-IT Chief Officers and contractor managers-in the relocation of IT to make them aware of what requirements must be met that will enable IT to be accommodated appropriately in the design of Central Campus Phase 11 -the time in which IT and its contractors are scheduled to be relocated. Besides supporting TBMP, I also supported the Section 508 Policy Compliance Coordinator, R. Liang. Section 508 is a policy that requires employers to implement accessibility assurance of information and technology to disabled communities. On Thursday, July 19, 2012, I was able to go to Camp Boggy Creek-a camp for disabled children-for an education outreach, in collaboration with the Education Office. We shared with them information about how astronauts live and work in space, they were able to ride hovercrafts, build paper rockets, and then launch them outside. Although this outreach was quite fun with the kids at the camp, this was a learning opportunity to gain some insight to those with cognitive and physical disabilities, the problems they typically face, and in tum, how to accommodate those with disabilities in the work environment. In the process of implementing accessibility and Section 508 compliance, I attended various teleconferences, did field runs to supply closed-caption call phones to employees with limited hearing, and helped with the development of the charter ofthe Section 508 Compliance Working Group...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine if such effective teaching behaviors as enthusiasm and verbal clarity impact decisions by administrators when they are faced with assigning teachers to high and low track classes. An experiment was conducted where subjects were presented two fictitious job descriptions (one low track and one high track) and asked to assign a fictitious teacher to one of the two positions. Nine fictitious teachers were created for the experiment. Two hundred and ninety-eight subjects were selected and within present position were randomly assigned to treatment conditions. The sample was stratified according to present position held (practicing administrator; teacher; <b>administrative</b> <b>trainee,</b> and teacher trainee), allowing a 3 x 3 x 4 x 2 (enthusiasm x verbal clarity x position x track assignment) completely crossed design. Dependent measures in addition to assignment to track were predicted teacher effectiveness in a low track position and predicted teacher effectiveness in a high track position. Methods of analysis employed included logic modeling, analysis of variance, and multiple regression. The major findings of this study indicated that the enthusiasm of a teacher affected the assignment of that teacher. The nature of this effect was characterized by a tendency to assign teachers exhibiting higher levels of enthusiasm to low track positions. This effect is in the opposite direction of what which would account for the previously reported imbalance of student perceptions of teacher enthusiasm observed between student tracks. Teacher verbal clarity and the position of the decision-maker did not effect the decision-maker's subsequent assignment of the teacher. While both teacher enthusiasm and verbal clarity were found to affect the predicted effectiveness of a teacher in a low track position, neither were found to affect the predicted effectiveness of a teacher in a high track position. Position of the decision-maker did not affect the predicted effectiveness of the teacher in either track. Based on subjects' responses to an open-ended question other variables identified as important to the assignment of teachers to high track positions are college GPA and coursework...|$|E
