25|$|Boxing is {{a combat}} sport {{in which two}} people, usually wearing {{protective}} gloves, throw punches <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> predetermined set of time in a boxing ring.|$|E
25|$|On April 4, {{after the}} two {{unfamiliar}} armies had exchanged messages and stared <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few days, da Gama formed his troops into an infantry square and marched against the Imam's lines, repelling successive waves of Muslim attacks with musket and cannon. This battle ended when Imam Ahmad {{was wounded in the}} leg by a chance shot; seeing his banners signal retreat, the Portuguese and their Abyssinian allies fell upon the disorganized Muslims, who suffered losses but managed to reform next to the river on the distant side.|$|E
60|$|Denis and {{he looked}} silently <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second or two.|$|E
60|$|Left together, {{we looked}} <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>for</b> the first moment, in silence.|$|R
50|$|Roxy and Prue {{yet again}} were {{fighting}} and yelling <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> the whole task.|$|R
60|$|Gordon made {{a gesture}} {{indicating}} his doubt in the subject, and they looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> half a minute.|$|R
60|$|The two {{men looked}} <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, and then Nasmyth smiled.|$|E
60|$|They looked steadfastly <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, {{and then}} Don Ippolito spoke.|$|E
60|$|Mother and son looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. Then Mrs. Duncan {{began to}} laugh and cry together.|$|E
60|$|The boys gazed <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> {{one moment}} in silence, then hastily stuffed the remnant of their feast into their pockets.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Effingham and his {{daughter}} looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>for</b> it <b>at</b> once struck them all painfully, {{that there must be}} Asshetons of another family.|$|R
6000|$|Father {{and child}} looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> {{some time in}} silent dismay. It was a terrible homecoming--so {{different}} from what each had been fondly anticipating! ...|$|R
60|$|We looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second. Then {{he began}} to smile, and we both went off into a peal of laughter.|$|E
60|$|Just as {{he spoke}} the {{lighthouse}} received a blow so tremendous that all the men started and looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment in surprise.|$|E
60|$|The two stood gazing <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{minute in}} silence; then June walked forward {{and held out}} her hand. Irene did not take it.|$|E
60|$|The {{farmer and}} his wife were {{confused}} by this statement and looked guiltily <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>for</b> they were honest people and wished to wrong no one.|$|R
60|$|She {{bent forward}} to kiss his cheek, and he kissed hers. Then they looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> an instant with clasped hands, {{and he turned}} away.|$|R
60|$|The young Hardys looked aghast <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>for</b> in the {{pressure}} of other matters the question of apparatus for the sugar manufacture had been quite forgotten.|$|R
60|$|She obeyed; {{he seized}} it with avidity as if eager {{to raise it}} to his lips, but halfway up {{released}} his grasp. They looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time.|$|E
60|$|They looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. My father {{seemed to}} think it beneath his dignity to answer her. He went on with {{what he had to}} say to me.|$|E
60|$|The old horse-trader and his {{right-hand}} rider looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment in}} silence. They understood each other. Then Bostil {{returned to the}} task of pulling on wet boots and Holley went away.|$|E
6000|$|The two {{old ladies}} were stunned, paralyzed--petrified, one may almost say--and could only sit and gaze vacantly <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> some moments; then Aunt Betsy Hale said impressively: ...|$|R
6000|$|The brethren and Rosamund looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>for</b> {{having so}} much to say it seemed {{that they could not}} speak at all. Then with a low cry Rosamund said: ...|$|R
60|$|He then departed, having first saluted the Englishman and Angus M'Aulay, who {{remained}} looking <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> {{some time in}} silence, and then burst out into a fit of laughter.|$|R
60|$|The two of 'em {{stood there}} looking <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute, {{and then my}} wife, holding the letter between 'er finger and thumb {{as if it was}} pison, passed it to Mrs. Smithers.|$|E
6000|$|The two {{men looked}} <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few seconds. Stangrave longed to say, [...] "You intend to shoot me? Then try at once;" [...] {{but he was}} ashamed, of course, {{to make use of}} words which he had so accidentally overheard.|$|E
6000|$|After Mary had {{concluded}} this story, which, we may remark, she related with much fewer comments {{than we have}} seen fit to pass upon it, she and March looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time in silence. Then March suddenly exclaimed-- ...|$|E
60|$|The Caterpillar and Alice looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> {{some time}} in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and {{addressed}} her in a languid, sleepy voice.|$|R
6000|$|Foy and Martin looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>for</b> {{now they}} {{understood}} exactly {{why they were}} there, and Ramiro, watching {{them out of the}} corners of his eyes, went on in a low voice: ...|$|R
60|$|They {{remained}} looking <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> {{three or}} four seconds. Then Manning flopped {{back in his chair}} and dropped his chin like a man shot. There was a long silence between them.|$|R
60|$|With this, {{the mare}} pulled {{alongside}} and began gradually {{to pass the}} girl. Chris and Lute looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, the mare still drawing ahead, so that Chris was compelled slowly to turn his head. The mill was a hundred yards away.|$|E
60|$|We sat looking <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment in}} a silence which I for my part could not have broken. I read in her face, in her altered expression, and the {{softened}} gleam of her eyes, all that I was expected to read. I said nothing.|$|E
60|$|But {{even this}} failed to awaken the sleeper. He turned over towards the fire, his arm {{fell to the}} ground, and his head drooped heavily upon it. The widow and her unwelcome visitor gazed at him and <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, and then she motioned him towards the door.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{in their}} dismay the brethren looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>for</b> they seemed further from their desire {{than they had}} been even in the castle of Sinan. Then a light broke upon the face of Godwin, and he stood up and answered: ...|$|R
60|$|Jack aroused him {{and they}} walked briskly back toward the little church which they found already quite filled with young people. The choir, {{including}} Mary, smiled at the audience and <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>for</b> {{the spirit of the}} little church was humanly cheerful.|$|R
6000|$|Mollett {{of course}} turned round, {{and found himself}} confronted with the woman. They stared <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> some moments, and then Mollett said, in a low dull voice, [...] "Yes, she knows me; it was she that lived with her at Tallyho Lodge." ...|$|R
