50|$|An <b>anamorphic</b> <b>stretch</b> {{transform}} (AST) {{also referred}} to as warped stretch transform is a physics-inspired signal transform that emerged from time stretch dispersive Fourier transform. The transform can be applied to analog temporal signals such as communication signals, or to digital spatial data such as images. The transform reshapes the data {{in such a way that}} its output has properties conducive for data compression and analytics. The reshaping consists of warped stretching in Fourier domain. The name “Anamorphic” is used because of the metaphoric analogy between the warped stretch operation and warping of images in anamorphosis and surrealist artworks.|$|E
50|$|Here the {{principle}} is described {{in the context of}} feature enhancement in digital images. The image is first filtered with a spatial kernel followed by application of a nonlinear frequency-dependent phase. The output of the transform is the phase in the spatial domain. The main step is the 2-D phase function which is typically applied in the frequency domain. The amount of phase applied to the image is frequency dependent with higher amount of phase applied to higher frequency features of the image. Since sharp transitions, such as edges and corners, contain higher frequencies, PST emphasizes the edge information. Features can be further enhanced by applying thresholding and morphological operations. PST is related to warped (<b>anamorphic)</b> <b>stretch</b> transform, another computational algorithm inspired by optical physics and one that performs nonuniform sampling and sparse coding.|$|E
50|$|At a minimum, HDTV {{has twice}} the linear {{resolution}} of standard-definition television (SDTV), thus showing greater detail than either analog television or regular DVD. The technical standards for broadcasting HDTV also handle the 16:9 aspect ratio images without using letterboxing or <b>anamorphic</b> <b>stretching,</b> thus increasing the effective image resolution.|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{method of}} producing fingerprints by {{total internal reflection}} using a right-angle prism does not give true size images. In this case an anamorphic real image is formed by the Scheimpflug condition with keystone distortion. A method of combining a single prism with the right-angle prism for <b>anamorphic</b> <b>stretching</b> to get the correct fingerprint image is described. The method of constructing such a type of an optical system is discussed in detail. The method is useful to directly obtain the correct fingerprints using a CCD camera...|$|R
50|$|<b>Anamorphic</b> (warped) <b>stretch</b> {{transform}} is a physics-based mathematical {{operation that}} reduces the signal bandwidth without proportionally increasing {{the size of the}} signal, thus providing space-bandwidth product compression. Its digital implementation emulates the physical effect by a non-uniform allocation of pixel density. This compression mechanism {{can be used as a}} pre-processing operation than may enhance conventional image compression techniques.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} coherent temporal imaging and its combination with the <b>anamorphic</b> <b>stretch</b> transform. The new system can measure both temporal profile of fast waveforms {{as well as their}} spectrum in real time and at high-throughput. We show that the combination of coherent detection and warped time-frequency mapping also performs time-bandwidth compression. By reducing the temporal width without sacrificing spectral resolution, it addresses the Big Data problem in real time instruments. The proposed method is the first application of the recently demonstrated <b>Anamorphic</b> <b>Stretch</b> Transform to temporal imaging. Using this method narrow spectral features beyond the spectrometer resolution can be captured. At the same time the output bandwidth and hence the record length is minimized. Coherent detection allows the temporal imaging and dispersive Fourier transform systems to operate in the traditional far field as well as in near field regimes...|$|E
40|$|Remote Sensing {{techniques}} are powerful tools for many {{civilian and military}} applications. However, in many cases high spatial, radiometric and temporal resolutions are required, leading to {{a large amount of}} data to be transmitted and/or stored. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is able to produce high resolution coherent images of a scene in any light and weather condition. In this paper we introduce the use of the Discrete <b>Anamorphic</b> <b>Stretch</b> Transform (DAST) to perform near lossless data compression of complex valued SAR image. DAST is applied to actual SAR data demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed technique...|$|E
40|$|Medical image {{compression}} {{have an important}} role in medical field because they are used for future reference of patients. Medical imaging poses the great challenge of having compression algorithms that reduce the loss of fidelity as much as possible so as not to contribute to diagnostic errors and yet have high compression rates for reduced storage and transmission time. A new method for medical {{image compression}} is introduced. It uses a new physics-based mathematical transformation that increases spatial coherency by causing feature selective stretch. <b>Anamorphic</b> <b>Stretch</b> Transform is used for compressing the medical images. The transformation increases the spatial coherence resulting in superior compression without sacrificing the image quality. AST can be considered as the generalized (or nonlinear) time-wavelength mapping. It minimizes the number of samples needed for a digital representation of the signal; in other words, it reduces the record length or the digital data size...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{concepts}} of radio interferometry which {{is very difficult to}} apply to the visible domain is phase closure. The main difficulty is the spatial requirement, namely that all pencil beams will interfere with all other beams on a flat detector. We use a pair-wise combination method using <b>anamorphic</b> <b>stretching</b> of the beams. All beams are lined up, imaged through a cylindrical lens into a square where each beam is now spread into a parallel line. The comb of lines is made to interfere with a copy of itself rotated at 900. A rotation shear interferometer is employed for that stage, and the cross pattern of apertures is imaged on the detector. The diagonal shows interference of each beam with itself, for intensity calibration purposes. An extended source clearly reduces contrast on some off-axis patterns, in a symmetric manner. We have already tested two designs in the laboratory using lasers and white light...|$|R
50|$|The Iscorama Cinegon was {{an updated}} version of the {{original}} 1968 Iscorama, designed specifically for the Cine market. It comprised an 1.8 10mm C-Mount taking lens, plus a detachable 1.5× <b>stretch</b> <b>anamorphic</b> adapter. This adapter appeared to be visually identical to the front section of the original Iscorama, but actually had a much larger 36mm diameter rear anamorphic element, which offered improved vignetting performance when the adapter was attached to third-party taking lenses. Like the original 1968 Iscorama, all Cinegons were single coated.|$|R
50|$|The Centa Vision was {{the only}} 2× {{horizontal}} <b>stretch</b> <b>anamorphic</b> adapter with an Iscorama style form-factor that ISCO ever produced, and closely resembled the Iscorama 42 visually. ISCO-manufactured Centa Visions were always multicoated. Confusingly, ISCO also marketed a batch of re-branded Kowa Prominar 16-H lenses under the Centavision name. These were manufactured by Kowa in Japan, and were optically identical to the other versions of this lens (Kowa 8Z, Kowa for Bell & Howell, Elmoscope II), but differed physically in three respects: the ISCO version included a front filter thread (72mm), had a standard diameter rear mounting thread (49mm), and featured a dual unit metric/imperial focus scale. The Kowa-manufactured version of the Centavision utilised a standard anamorphic focus mechanism, rather than ISCO's patented system.|$|R
