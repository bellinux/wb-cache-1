500|$|Brooks did not {{direct and}} write a film again for seven years until 2004's Spanglish.

He opted to cast Adam Sandler in a more dramatic role than his usual goofball comedy parts based on his performance in Punch-Drunk Love and Sandler's relationship with his family. Describing the length of production, Brooks said: [...] "It's <b>amazing</b> <b>how</b> much more perverse you are as a writer than as a director. I remember just being so happy that I'd painted myself into some corners [...] I thought that would make it interesting. When I had to wrestle with that as a director, it was a different story."

Gerrick D.

Dan Snierson for Entertainment Weekly opined that [...] "Ballad" [...] was {{not as good as}} the preceding episode, [...] "Wheels", but that overall: [...] "it did offer up a few choice cuts and fun moments while advancing one big story line".

[...] Slant Magazines critic and writer, Sal Cinquemani, wrote that the single [...] "isn't exactly filled with combustible energy and it lacks the full-throttle belting that accompanied the Return of the Voice three years ago, but it features all of the characteristics one expects from a latter-day Mariah track." [...] Rachel Devitt of Rhapsody expressed a desire to see Carey [...] "show off those legendary five octaves a bit more", while also noting the song's [...] "slightly paranoid/just-this-side-of-crazy lyrics threatening to hunt down her lover if he videos their tryst." [...] New York Daily News critic, David Hinckley, was critical on the song's simplicity, and wrote [...] " [...] a single that could have been cut by any one-hit diva-ette today – has scored a chart grand slam.

500|$|... "Duets" [...] was {{generally}} well received by critics, {{many of whom}} contrasted it favorably with the preceding season two episodes. The New York Times Rebecca Milzoff called it {{the best of the}} season to that point [...] "in terms of old-school Glee", and indeed, both Lisa Respers France of CNN and Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post found it a reminder of why they originally loved the show. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal summarized: [...] "This was a return to that honeymoon feeling, when Glee first surprised, scandalized and satisfied you." [...] TV Guide Damian Holbrook and the Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson appreciated the lack of gimmicks; the former explained [...] "No Britney numbers. No forced guest stars. No reasons to check out. It's <b>amazing</b> <b>how</b> satisfying a show can be when the characters we invested in a year ago get to do something more than set-dress a stunt." [...] James Poniewozik of Time labelled it [...] "easily the strongest character episode so far this season". While The Atlantic Kevin Fallon opined that the series finally achieved the correct [...] "tonal balance of comedy and drama", his colleague Meghan Brown provided one of few dissenting reviews; she called it a lazy, nonsensical episode which contributed to a building [...] "sophomore slump". MTV's Aly Semigran found it lackluster after [...] "Grilled Cheesus", and although Anthony Benigno of the Daily News deemed it an improvement on the previous episode, he concluded that it was not one of the season's best.|$|E

In December 2014, G. Babu Jayakumar of The New Indian Express included the film in his list of Balachander's noted films. Clips from Server Sundaram were screened along with clips from other films such as Iru Kodugal (1969), Arangetram (1973), Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), Avargal (1977) and Azhagan (1991) at a function held in Balachander's honour at Tiruchirappalli in January 2015, a month after his death. Server Sundaram is also used as the title of an 2017 film starring Santhanam and Nagesh's grandson Bijesh, with its producer Selva having bought the title rights from AVM Productions. On why that title was chosen, Selva said, [...] "Santhanam plays a chef in the film and we felt that Server Sundaram, in which Nagesh played the role of a server, would be apt for this film, too. It is <b>amazing</b> <b>how</b> well the title suited the concept of our film, which is why we went right ahead with our decision." [...] S. Jegathiswaran, writing for Daily News Sri Lanka, noted, [...] "In [...] Sundaram, [...] showed that after having gained the social status one shouldn't forget one's past." [...] Actor Vikram, who became popularly known by the moniker [...] "Chiyaan" [...] after the release of Sethu in 1999, stated in August 2016, [...] "After Nagesh sir [...] becomes something else, he still holds his server uniform close to his heart as a memento.

500|$|Since airing, [...] "Treehouse of Horror XXII" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Josh Harrison of Ology was positive {{and gave the}} episode a rating of seven out of ten, but commented that he preferred [...] "episodes that feature longer, more involved storylines more than the spoof collections." [...] At The A.V. Club, Hayden Childs gave the episode a C+ grade, saying, [...] "The writers seem unwilling to mock the more outrageous aspects of the movies they are sending up and settle for weakly batting at the obvious. Some of the jokes land, but none land too solidly." [...] Meredith Woerner of io9 thought that [...] "he whole thing never quite achieved {{the same level of}} brilliance as some previous years — even though the Avatar bit was funny, we've seen so many Avatar spoofs by now that, well, it's tired. However we did get a lot of joy out of seeing Homer dressed up as Doctor Manhattan and Maggie as a wee-little chest burster." [...] Even more critical was CraveOnline's Blair Marnell who gave the episode a rating of three out of ten. He commented that [...] "there is no stronger argument for ending 'The Simpsons' than the latest Halloween installment of 'Treehouse of Horror'" [...] and further said that [...] "in all honesty, it's <b>amazing</b> <b>how</b> tame 'The Simpsons' has become over the years. This show used to be the 'South Park' of its day. Now it's just showing its age and it's no longer the cool TV rebel that it used to be." [...] Alex Strachan had the opposite reaction in a review in Calgary Herald and concluded that we should [...] "orget all that talk about The Simpsons being past its prime.

For {{the first time since}} last season, I felt engrossed enough to not be consumed with all the small things this show gets wrong. Up until this episode, the majority of this season has consisted exclusively of small things: petty dramas, misdirected stakes, so much stalling. I’m not sure I can {{go so far as to}} say that it got everything right with this one, but at least it was entertaining and the nonstop action felt like content instead of just bookends." [...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald wrote that it was the closest the program [...] "ever resembled the climax of a George Romero film."
