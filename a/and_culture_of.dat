5|$|Following {{the demise}} of the Pandya kingdom in the 14th century, Kumbakonam was conquered by the Vijayanagar Empire. Krishnadevaraya (1509–29), the emperor of Vijayanagara visited the town in 1524 and is {{believed}} to have bathed in the famous Mahamaham tank during the Mahamaham festival. Kumbakonam was ruled by the Madurai Nayaks and the Thanjavur Nayaks from 1535 to 1673 when it fell to the Marathas. Each of these foreign dynasties had a considerable impact on the demographics <b>and</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> the region.

5|$|L'Homme-Rivière is {{a statue}} {{representing}} a log driver at work. The logs are heavily stylized, reduced {{to little more}} than cylinders. The driver and his hook, however, are shown as transforming into a wooden plant. Its location, in a tight space between two tall buildings, gives the sculpture the appearance of travelling down a river gorge. L'Homme-Rivière is highly dynamic, and has been described as looking as though it is about to spill onto the sidewalk. The log driver is a symbolic figure in the history <b>and</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> Quebec, thanks notably to Félix-Antoine Savard's famous novel Menaud, maître draveur.|$|E

5|$|Mycenaean civilization {{originated}} and {{evolved from}} the society <b>and</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> the Early and Middle Helladic period in mainland Greece under influences from Minoan Crete. Towards {{the end of the}} Middle Bronze Age (c. 1600 BC) {{a significant increase in the}} population and the number of settlements occurred. A number of centers of power emerged in southern mainland Greece dominated by a warrior elite society, while the typical dwellings of that era were an early type of megaron buildings. Some more complex structures are classified as forerunners of the later palaces. In a number of sites, defensive walls were also erected.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia {{is usually}} caused by {{infection}} with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications and {{conditions such as}} autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, and asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke, or a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, <b>and</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired with community, hospital, or health care associated pneumonia.|$|E

5|$|Result {{from the}} {{expansion}} of the British Empire, British cultural influence can be observed in the language <b>and</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> a geographically wide assortment of countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, the United States, and the British overseas territories. These states are sometimes collectively known as the Anglosphere. As well as the British influence on its empire, the empire also influenced British culture, particularly British cuisine. Innovations and movements within the wider-culture of Europe have also changed the United Kingdom; Humanism, Protestantism, and representative democracy have developed from broader Western culture.|$|E
5|$|Sviatoslav's {{campaign}} {{brought the}} prosperity and independence of Khazaria {{to an abrupt}} end.

Moreover, Sviatoslav's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in the region of the Saltovo-Mayaki culture, greatly changing the demographics <b>and</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> the transitional area between the forest and the steppe.|$|E
