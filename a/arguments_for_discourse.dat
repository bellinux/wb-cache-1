40|$|While ancient historians {{create and}} study surveys of extant {{literature}} {{to determine what}} texts form the core of Graeco-Roman literate education, biblical scholars have not used this approach to examine what scriptural texts might make up the core of early Christian teaching and formation. Based on a comprehensive survey of the Pauline epistles referenced in early Christian texts up {{to the time of}} Constantine, this paper aims to begin to remedy deficiencies in questions about early Christian teaching and formation. In particular, I will focus on one of the passages most used by early Christians in their writings: 1 Corinthians 2. 6 - 16. What can the widespread and frequent use of this passage by early Christians tell us about the texts they knew and how they were using the Pauline epistles? By examining the many contexts in which this Corinthian passage is used, this paper concentrates on a selection of patristic texts in order to determine whether a community of interpretation or a diversity of use exists among patristic authors who rely on 1 Corinthians 2 within their writings. I have found, and as this paper attempts to illustrate, that early Christian writers use excerpts from this Corinthian passage in at least four distinct and yet connected ways: <b>for</b> rhetorical <b>argument,</b> <b>for</b> apologetic <b>discourse,</b> <b>for</b> exegesis of difficult texts, and for discussing wisdom and Christian formation. Looking at each of these uses in patristic literature throughout our time period, therefore, this paper not only demonstrates that a community of interpretation exists in how early Christians rely on 1 Corinthians 2. 6 - 16, but also provides a foundation for further study of early Christian formation {{within the context of a}} Patristic reception of the Pauline epistles...|$|R
40|$|Approaches to {{discourse}} that directly compute the relation" that holds between adjacent units of text, {{have a problem}} with clauses that contain more than one discourse connective: the situation seems to allow such a clause to relate in {{more than one way to}} more than one other unit of text. We show how this is not a problem for an approach based on lexicalized grammar and a lexical semantics <b>for</b> <b>discourse</b> connectives. The result is an <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> syntax not stopping at the sentence boundary and <b>for</b> <b>discourse</b> not starting there. 1 Keywords: Discourse, Semantics, Lexicalized Grammar 1. Introduction Lexicalized grammars such as TAG (Joshi, 1987; XTAG-Group, 1998) and CCG (Steedman, 1996) have been very successful in showing how clause-level syntax and semantics project from the lexicon. What drives the current enterprise is the hypothesis that the same can be shown true, at some level, <b>for</b> <b>discourse</b> syntax and semantics.

While opinions concerning the ontological argument differ widely (and have been from the moment the Proslogion was written), it is generally agreed that the argument is most convincing to Anselm's intended audience: that is, Christian believers seeking a rational basis for their belief in God.|$|R

50|$|The {{attempt to}} provide proofs or <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> the {{existence}} of God is one aspect {{of what is known}} as natural theology or the natural theistic project. This strand of natural theology attempts to justify belief in God by independent grounds. There is plenty of philosophical literature on faith (especially fideism) and other subjects generally considered to be outside the realm of natural theology. Perhaps most of philosophy of religion is predicated on natural theology's assumption that the existence of God can be justified or warranted on rational grounds. There has been considerable philosophical and theological debate about the kinds of proofs, justifications and arguments that are appropriate <b>for</b> this <b>discourse.</b>|$|R

In substance, it claims that the introspective fact of inner speech provides strong evidence that our thoughts are linguistic. This article challenges this argument. I claim that the Introspective <b>Argument</b> <b>for</b> Sententialism confuses the content of our thoughts with their vehicles: while sententialism is a thesis about the vehicles of our thoughts, inner speech sentences are the content of auditory or articulatory images. The rebuttal of the introspective <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> sententialism is shown to have a general significance in cognitive science: introspection does not tell us how we think...|$|R
