5|$|Bavaro {{struggled}} with a degenerative knee condition throughout the 1990 season and was rarely able to practice. The Giants cut him in July 1991 {{because of the}} injury. After some initial dispute, the Giants signed him to a one-year US$310,000 contract and placed him on the physically unable to perform list. He spent the season as a tight end coach at Saint Dominic Savio High School in East Boston, Massachusetts. He took the position after the team's coach took <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>and</b> wrote Bavaro a letter to {{ask him if he}} would consider coaching.|$|E
5|$|Magi sacrifices {{herself to}} give the fairies <b>a</b> <b>chance,</b> <b>and</b> she tells Crysta to {{remember}} everything she's learned. Zak manages to stop the machine, depriving Hexxus {{the source of his}} power, but he manifests himself within the oil in the machine and begins to ignite the forest ablaze. Crysta seemingly sacrifices herself by allowing herself to be devoured by Hexxus and all seems lost, until he begins to sprout limbs and leaves like a tree. Pips {{and the rest of the}} fairies rally to the powers they have been given, which causes the seed that Crysta fed him to start growing wildly. Hexxus is imprisoned by the newly grown tree at the very border of FernGully which bursts into bloom. Crysta appears after the fight, having survived her ordeal and successfully succeeded Magi as a magical fairy. She gives Zak a seed, begging him to remember everything that has transpired and she sadly restores him to his human size. Remembering the seed in his hand, Zak promises to remember his adventure, and buries the seed in the soil before telling Tony and Ralph that things need to change as they leave the forest behind. The seed sprouts new growth for FernGully, as Crysta follows Pips with Batty behind her.|$|E
25|$|When {{only four}} fresh eggs were {{available}} one morning at a London hotel, he awarded {{them to the}} bowlers because Lancashire {{were likely to be}} fielding all day. His team respected and liked him, and he did exactly what an amateur should: he declared boldly to give the opposition <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>and</b> his bowlers time to take their wickets. The crowds returned to Old Trafford, and the team were slightly unlucky to finish only third.|$|E

After beating MAB Schkeuditz (2–0), Lokomotive Leipzig-Ost (7–1), Lokomotive Cottbus (7–2) and Oberliga side BSG Chemie Leipzig (1–0, 1–2, advance on away goals), the teams faced Dynamo Dresden who were ranked {{second in the}} 1975–76 DDR-Oberliga at the time.

25|$|Kent had {{to settle}} for a draw in a see-sawing match against Surrey at Tunbridge Wells, looking to control the game with skipper David Fulton and Robert Key in. However, Martin Bicknell sparked a mini-collapse, {{removing}} four wickets in a short space of time to give Surrey <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>and</b> finishing with four for 31 from 24 overs. However, after going from 112 for 0 to 129 for 5, Key and Andrew Hall built a partnership of 100 for the sixth wicket to save Kent's blushes. The Kent innings was finished off by slow left-armer Nayan Doshi who took three for 58 as Kent crumbled to 262 all out.|$|E
25|$|When the Great Depression hit in 1931, Edelbrock went to California to {{live with}} his brother, Carl. Initially, he moved in with his brother and took a job as an auto mechanic. In order to earn some extra money to open his own repair shop, Edelbrock took an evening job in {{downtown}} Los Angeles parking cars at a large apartment complex. It was a chance encounter at this parking complex where he bumped into the 19-year-old Irish woman, Katherine (Katie) Collins, who was working as a day maid. Despite the fact that Katie was engaged, Edelbrock convinced her to give him <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>and</b> not marry her fiancé. They married in June 1933, just eight weeks after meeting.|$|E

25|$|Deke Slayton was the Director of Flight Crew Operations and {{effectively}} chose the crews for the flights. He {{did not intend}} to give astronauts two lunar landing commands but, according to historian Michael Cassutt, as late as the summer of 1969when 10 landings were still scheduledSlayton planned to give Lunar Module Pilots Fred Haise, Edgar Mitchell, and James Irwin the opportunity to walk again on the Moon as Commanders. During the early Apollo missions he used a rotation system of assigning a crew as backup and then, three missions later, as the prime crew; however, by the later Apollo flights, this system was used less frequently as astronauts left the program, Slayton wanted to give rookies <b>a</b> <b>chance,</b> <b>and</b> astronauts did not want to take backup positions that no longer could lead to prime-crew spots.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{contests}} {{took place}} from January 3 to July 14 and elected and allocated 2,286 voting {{delegates to the}} 2012 Republican National Convention in the week of August 27. To become the Republican Party's nominee for the 2012 presidential election a candidate needed a majority of 1,144 delegates {{to vote for him}} and plurality in five state delegations. The 2012 race was significantly different from earlier races. Many states switched from their old winner-take-all allocation to proportional allocation. Many remaining winner-take-all states allocated delegates to both the winner of each congressional district and the winner of the state. The change was made to prolong the race, giving lesser known candidates <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>and</b> making it harder for a frontrunner to secure the majority early. It was also hoped that this change in the election system would energize the base of the party.|$|E

25|$|Going back to Nalebuff (1987), the Monty Hall {{problem is}} also much {{studied in the}} {{literature}} on game theory and decision theory, and also some popular solutions correspond to this point of view. Vos Savant asks for a decision, not <b>a</b> <b>chance.</b> <b>And</b> the chance aspects of how the car is hidden and how an unchosen door is opened are unknown. From this point of view, one has to remember that the player has two opportunities to make choices: first of all, which door to choose initially; and secondly, whether or not to switch. Since he does not know how the car is hidden nor how the host makes choices, he may be able to make use of his first choice opportunity, as it were to neutralize the actions of the team running the quiz show, including the host.|$|E
25|$|Wong Kar-wai {{was born}} on 17 July 1958 in Shanghai, the {{youngest}} of three siblings. His father was a sailor {{and his mother was}} a housewife. By the time Wong was five years old, the seeds of the Cultural Revolution were beginning to take effect in China and his parents decided to relocate to British-ruled Hong Kong. The two older children were meant to join them later, but the borders closed before they had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>and</b> Wong did not see his brother or sister again for ten years. In Hong Kong, the family settled in the Tsim Sha Tsui district, and his father got work managing a night club. Being an only child in a new city, and speaking only Mandarin, Wong has said he felt isolated during his childhood; he struggled to learn Cantonese and English, only becoming fluent in these new languages when he was a teenager.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{receiving}} a red {{card in the}} previous game, Ljungberg was ineligible to play the next Seattle Sounders game. As a result, All-Star coach Dominic Kinnear played Ljungberg for a full 90 minutes. At {{the end of the}} game, Ljungberg started to have impaired vision. When the game went to penalty kicks, he chose to sit it out due to his loss of vision after an on-set migraine. Unfortunately for Ljungberg, the initial five kicks ended in a draw. Kinnear, not fully understanding Ljungberg's condition, sent him out as the sixth kicker. Ljungberg, unable to see, took <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>and</b> just tapped the ball in the center of net. However, Tim Howard caught it, resulting in Everton's win. Immediately following the game, Ljungberg was removed from the field on a stretcher. Later, Ljungberg told reporters that he ingested trace amount of red wine while in Utah, resulting in his second migraine within months.|$|E

25|$|In June 2009, Bale {{underwent}} surgery for a knee injury, ruling {{him out for}} over two months. He missed pre-season matches and it was projected that he would miss {{the first few weeks}} of the 2009–10 season. On 26 September, he made his comeback as an 85th-minute substitute in Tottenham's 5–0 win over Burnley. This was Bale's first ever involvement in a Premier League win, after playing a record 24 league matches for Spurs without being on the winning side. However, he struggled to break into the first team, in part thanks to Benoît Assou-Ekotto's good form. When Assou-Ekotto was sidelined with an injury, manager Harry Redknapp decided to give Bale <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>and</b> he impressed in Spurs' FA Cup third-round 4–0 win over Peterborough. He finally tasted victory {{for the first time as}} a starter in a league game in the 2–0 win over London rivals Fulham on 26 January 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{fourth day}} saw the turnaround. V.V.S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid batted the entire day, never {{offering}} <b>a</b> <b>chance,</b> <b>and</b> ran the Australian fielders ragged as Waugh called on nine different bowlers {{to try to}} break the partnership. Laxman and Dravid added 335 runs, taking India to 589/4 and a commanding lead in the game. In the process, Laxman set a new individual high score record for India, surpassing Sunil Gavaskar's 236. Laxman was finally dismissed the next day on 281. Dravid made 180, and India declared on day 5 at 657/7, setting Australia an almost impossible target of 384 runs. Australia did not immediately crumble under the reversed pressure; at tea, they were 161/3 for their final innings, and a draw looked the most likely result. Then, the Australians lost 5 wickets for 8 in a span of 31 balls, with Harbhajan taking the first two wickets in the same over and Tendulkar taking the other three. Australia fell for 212 all out, with Harbhajan leading the bowling attack with 6–73. India had {{come back from the}} dead and recorded a stunning 171-run victory to level the series 1–1. They were only the third team in history to win a Test match after following on.|$|E
