40|$|The {{increased}} demand for pork, reared in bedded systems, has caused more pigs to be produced in bedded systems such as hoop barns. Much of the current swine nutrition information has been generated in confinement settings without bedding. As omnivores, pigs ingest some bedding. The objectives {{of the study were}} {{to determine the effects of}} bedding on finishing pigs in bedded hoop barns by: 1) conducting digestibility trials using indigestible markers in the feed, and 2) conducting a growth performance study of pigs with and without bedding in hoop barns. The trials were conducted during summer 2010 and will continue in 2011 at the ISU Western Research Farm, Castana, IA in three mini-hoop barns each with two pens. Each hoop had one bedded and one non-bedded pen of pigs. Cornstalks were used as bedding. Each pen had a self-feeder with one feeder space and an <b>automatic</b> <b>waterer.</b> The gating between the pens was altered to allow no bedding to pass through. All pigs on the trials were barrows. There were 2 trials during summer 2010 and there will be 2 trials in summer 2011. There were five pigs per pen starting at approximately 150 lb and fed for 49 days. For the last 14 days of the trials, the feed included titanium oxide as an indigestible marker. After five days on the marker, a fecal grab sample was collected from each pig. Fecal samples were frozen for later analysis of the marker to determine feed digestibility. Because the experiment is not complete, statistical analysis was not conducted; however, the growth feed intake, feed efficiency, backfat thickness and loin muscle area were similar for the barrows with and without bedding during summer months. Feed digestibility values are pending laboratory analysis...|$|E
40|$|Pigs {{used were}} both barrows and gilts, either Duroc or Black Poland China breeds. All pigs {{used in the}} study were {{approximately}} the same age when they went on test. The heavier pigs were assigned to lot 4. They were self-fed the basal ration listed in Table 22 while confined on a concrete floor. The ration was ground and pelleted. Water was available from <b>automatic</b> <b>waterers</b> at all times. For nozzles were use dot keep the pigs cool during warm weather. Individual pigs were removed from the test pen when they weighed approximately 230 pounds...|$|R
40|$|One hundred forty feeder pigs {{weighing}} approximately 60 to 80 {{pounds each}} and averaging 12 weeks of age were randomly divided by weight into groups of 14 pigs each. The pigs had been vaccinated previously for hog cholera {{and had been}} wormed with piperuzine. All pigs had been on concrete from birth {{and they had been}} raised under complete confinement. Each group of 14 pigs was placed in a pen 7 feet wide by 28 feet long with 16 feet of the pen under roof. Complete rations, either meal or pellets, were self-fed. An all-steel three-hole self-feeder was used in each pen. Water was always available from <b>automatic</b> <b>waterers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} various sources of protein in diets of lactating sows (fish meal, soybean oil meal and meat meal) and the effects of their supplementation on sows production. Forty-eight F₁ crossbred lactating sows (Large White x Swedish Landrace) were assigned to four treatment on the basis of litter order and weight. During pregnancy all the sows were fed the same diet. They were group fed in indoor concrete pens equipped with self-feeders and <b>automatic</b> <b>waterers.</b> During lactation period the sows were individualy fed with the mixtures of different composition (tab. 2). Control group of sows (I) was fed standard diet, but second group was fed with diet contained soybean protein, third group was fed with diet contained fish meal, and fourth group was fed diet contained meat protein. Sukling piglets received supplementary diet of the same composition. The piglets were weaned at four weeks of age. The data from this trial was evaluated by analysis of variance techniques as outlined by Barić (1964). On the basis of obtained results the following conclusions may be drawn: 1. Various sources of protein in diets of lactating sows did not have significant effect on their body weight changes and milk production. 2. Litter size at weaning and level of surviving of suekling piglets were not effected by various protein sources in ration of lactating sows. 3. Weaning weight of piglets of control group was significantly lower (P< 0. 05) than in piglets of testing groups. 4. Different feeding treatments of lactating sows did not have significant effect on „interim“ period lenght...|$|R
