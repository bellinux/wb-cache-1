5|$|The sperm whale's unique body is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species. The sperm whale's distinctive shape comes from its very large, block-shaped head, which can be one-quarter to one-third of the animal's length. The S-shaped blowhole is located very close {{to the front of the}} head <b>and</b> <b>shifted</b> to the whale's left. This gives rise to a distinctive bushy, forward-angled spray.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{earliest}} temnospondyls were primarily semiaquatic, {{they had the}} ability to feed on land. Later, eryopoids and dissorophoids, some well adapted to terrestrial life, also fed on land.

40|$|Abstract. We obtain {{expressions}} for Rydberg level broadening <b>and</b> <b>shift</b> {{cross sections}} <b>and</b> rates suitable for elastic collisions of ground-state rare-gas atoms with Rydberg atoms. The semiclassical impact broadening theory is used. The interaction of a Rydberg atom with a rare-gas atom is approximated by the superposition of polarisation potentials and the Fermi pseudopotential. It is shown that similar expressions for the broadening <b>and</b> <b>shift</b> cross sections {{due to the}} perturber-Rydberg-electron interaction can be obtained in the JWKB approximation for the Rydberg-electron wavefunctions and for the square-well model potential. Consequently the <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> width of the Rydberg level are not very sensitive {{to the shape of}} the potential but only to its normalisation. Expressions for the <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> width in the square-well potential approximation suitable in the high-density limit of the perturb-ing atoms are obtained. Limits of the applicability of the expressions for the broadening <b>and</b> <b>shift</b> cross sections are discussed. Calculated broadening <b>and</b> <b>shift</b> rates agree well with experimental results for the broadening <b>and</b> <b>shift</b> of Rydberg levels with small, medium and large principal quantum numbers by all rare gases excepting neon. 1...|$|R
5|$|Moving west, {{the troop}} {{followed}} the division {{as it took}} positions in the Saar-Moselle Triangle, facing the Siegfried Switch Line on 7 January 1945, <b>and</b> <b>shifted</b> to the offensive on 14 January, seizing Tettingen and Butzdorf that day. The following day, the Nennigberg-Wies area was wrested from the German army, but heavy counterattacks followed and Butzdorf, Berg, and most of Nennig changed hands several times before being finally secured. On 20 January, an unsuccessful battalion attack against Orscholz, eastern terminus of the switch position, cost the division most of two companies. In early February, the division, with troop in tow, took the woods of Campholz and later Sinz.|$|E

5|$|Using {{techniques}} of genetic complementation, Macrae paired nonluminescent monocaryons with luminescent ones, {{and concluded that}} luminosity in P.stipticus is an inherited character, and governed by {{a single pair of}} alleles in which luminosity was dominant over nonluminosity. Luminosity factors were independent of intersterility factors. In 1992, Lingle and colleagues agreed with Macrae about luminosity and stated that at least three different gene mutations could lead to the loss of luminescence. They also reported that the maximum bioluminescence was found at 525nm, <b>and</b> <b>shifted</b> to 528nm in deeply pigmented fruit bodies.|$|E

5|$|During British Mandate rule in Palestine, al-Birwa {{was home}} to local power brokers, who {{mediated}} disputes in neighboring villages. Al-Birwa became a center of rebel operations during the 1936–1939 revolt against British rule. By the 1940s, many of the village's agrarian inhabitants lost their lands due to debt, <b>and</b> <b>shifted</b> to labor jobs in nearby cities, such as Haifa. However, {{the majority of the}} residents—men and women—continued to engage in farming, selling their olives, grains and other crops in the markets of Acre. Al-Birwa was captured by the Israelis in early June 1948, after which its local militia recaptured the village. Al-Birwa was then permanently occupied by the Israelis in late June. Afterward, its inhabitants, including future Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, fled to nearby villages or Lebanon. The Jewish communities of Yas'ur and Ahihud were established on al-Birwa's lands in 1949 and 1950, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Following the Stonewall riots, lesbian {{themes in}} {{literature}} {{became much more}} diverse and complex, <b>and</b> <b>shifted</b> the focus of lesbianism from erotica for heterosexual men to works written by and for lesbians. Feminist magazines such as The Furies, and Sinister Wisdom replaced The Ladder. Serious writers who used lesbian characters and plots included Rita Mae Brown's Rubyfruit Jungle (1973), which presents a feminist heroine who chooses to be a lesbian. Poet Audre Lorde confronts homophobia and racism in her works, and Cherríe Moraga is credited with being primarily responsible for bringing Latina perspectives to lesbian literature. Further changing values {{are evident in the}} writings of Dorothy Allison, who focuses on child sexual abuse and deliberately provocative lesbian sadomasochism themes.|$|E

5|$|Hong Kong's {{population}} recovered {{quickly after}} the war, as {{a wave of}} skilled migrants from the Republic of China moved in to seek refuge from the Chinese Civil War. When the Communist Party eventually took full control of mainland China in 1949, even more skilled migrants fled across the open border for fear of persecution. Many newcomers, especially {{those who had been}} based in the major port cities of Shanghai and Guangzhou, established corporations and small- to medium-sized businesses <b>and</b> <b>shifted</b> their base operations to British Hong Kong. The establishment of a socialist state in China (People's Republic of China) on 1 October 1949 caused the British colonial government to reconsider Hong Kong's open border to mainland China. In 1951, a boundary zone was demarked as a buffer zone against potential military attacks from communist China. Border posts along the north of Hong Kong began operation in 1953 to regulate the movement of people and goods {{into and out of the}} territory.|$|E
5|$|In 1230 the Teutonic Knights, a crusading {{military}} order, {{moved to}} Chełmno Land and launched the Prussian Crusade against the pagan Prussian clans. With {{support from the}} pope and Holy Roman Emperor, the Teutons conquered and converted the Prussians by the 1280s <b>and</b> <b>shifted</b> {{their attention to the}} pagan Grand Duchy of Lithuania. For about 100 years the Knights raided Lithuanian lands, particularly Samogitia, as it separated the Knights in Prussia from their branch in Livonia. While the border regions became an uninhabited wilderness, the Knights gained very little territory. The Lithuanians first gave up Samogitia during the Lithuanian Civil War (1381–1384) in the Treaty of Dubysa. The territory was used as a bargaining chip to ensure Teutonic support for one of the sides in the internal power struggle.|$|E
5|$|In June 1912, {{during one}} of his Friday prayer sermons, he called for volunteers to engage in a jihad against the Italians. Accepting only volunteers with prior Ottoman {{military}} training, al-Qassam enlisted dozens of volunteers and set up a fund for the expedition to Libya as well as a small pension for the families of volunteers while they were abroad. Although accounts vary, al-Qassam was accompanied by 60 to 250 volunteers known as mujahideen (those who engage in jihad) when he arrived in Alexandretta {{in the latter part of}} that year. Intending to gain sea transportation from the Ottomans, al-Qassam's request was rejected by the authorities who ordered him and his men back to Jableh. A new Ottoman government in Istanbul had gained power <b>and</b> <b>shifted</b> the state's focus to the Balkan front in October, abandoning the Libyan resistance. Part of the money that was raised was then used to establish a madrasa in Jableh while the remainder was saved for future efforts.|$|E

5|$|In September 2014, {{a wave of}} {{ransomware}} Trojans surfaced {{that first}} targeted users in Australia, under the names CryptoWall and CryptoLocker (which is, as with CryptoLocker 2.0, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker). The Trojans spread via fraudulent e-mails claiming to be failed parcel delivery notices from Australia Post; to evade detection by automatic e-mail scanners that follow all links on a page to scan for malware, this variant was designed to require users to visit a web page and enter a CAPTCHA code before the payload is actually downloaded, preventing such automated processes {{from being able to}} scan the payload. Symantec determined that these new variants, which it identified as CryptoLocker.F, were again, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker due to differences in their operation. A notable victim of the Trojans was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; live programming on its television news channel ABC News 24 was disrupted for half an hour <b>and</b> <b>shifted</b> to Melbourne studios due to a CryptoWall infection on computers at its Sydney studio.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{possession}} of the second half, the Terrapins were forced to punt after a run attempt for loss, a false start penalty, and two incomplete passes. The Maryland defense took the field and stopped a Clemson drive. On the first play of their second series, wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey executed a reverse to gain 76yards before being stopped at the Clemson four-yard line. This set up a short Chris Turner touchdown pass to receiver Torrey Smith, <b>and</b> <b>shifted</b> the game's momentum in favor of Maryland. In the fourth quarter, three completions to Danny Oquendo {{set the stage for}} a one-yard rush into the endzone by Da'Rel Scott.
