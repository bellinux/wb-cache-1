500|$|I saw the boy getting {{injured in}} his leg, {{and the father}} asking for help. Then I saw him getting injured in his arm, the father. The father was asking the {{ambulances}} to help him, because {{he could see the}} ambulances. I cannot see the ambulance... I wasn't far away, maybe from them [...] face to face about 15 meters, 17 meters. But the father didn't succeed to get the ambulance by waving to them. He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> said, [...] "Help me." [...] I said, [...] "I cannot, I can't help you." [...] The shooting till then was really heavy... It was really raining bullets, for more than for 45minutes. Then... I hear something, [...] "boom!" [...] Really is coming with a lot of dust. I looked at the boy, I filmed the boy lying down in the father's lap, and the father really, getting really injured, and he was really dizzy. I said, [...] "Oh my god, the boy's got killed, the boy's got killed," [...] I was screaming, I was losing my mind. While I was filming, the boy got killed... I was very afraid, I was very upset, I was crying, and I was remembering my children.... This was the most terrible thing that has happened to me as a journalist.|$|E
2500|$|I said, [...] "I {{love the}} script and I love you, but I am a little afraid {{after all these years}} of playing heroines to go into an out-and-out killer." [...] And Mr. Wilder – and rightly so – looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> said, [...] "Well, are you a mouse or an actress?" [...] And I said, [...] "Well, I hope I'm an actress." [...] He said, [...] "Then do the part". And I did and I'm very {{grateful}} to him.|$|E
2500|$|Case 3. This case {{illustrates}} autonomic status epilepticus {{with frequent}} vomiting witnessed from onset. An 8-year-old boy of mixed race had 2 prolonged seizures {{at the age}} of 5 years. The first seizure occurred during a brief nap. He woke up and walked with “shaking feet” to his mother, complaining that he felt sick. Within 2 to 3 minutes, his eyes and subsequently his head turned to the extreme right. His mother recalls: “I asked him to look <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> would not. If I moved his head to the front, it would go back to the right. Within a minute he vomited, and his eyes started blinking, and there were also tiny jerks of his body, legs, and arms that lasted for a minute. He became unresponsive to anything I said to him. He then was rigid, and he went to a deep sleep like in a coma. In the hospital he continued to be in this unconscious state, ever so often just getting up to be sick, and straight back down again. He did not start to regain consciousness or be aware of people around until about 3 hours later. He was well the next morning and discharged home.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Hirsh {{had good}} leverage, pitched down to hitters, {{and had a}} refined {{repertoire}} of pitches. [...] He had a [...] "plus" [...] 2-seam fastball that had sink and good movement at 91–94mph, and threw a [...] "filthy" [...] hard-breaking slider that was consistently precise, and had bite at 80–86mph (managers rated it the best breaking ball in the Texas League). [...] Hirsh continued to refine his moderate changeup, which had fair deception and movement in the low-80s. [...] He also threw a 4-seam fastball in the 94–96mph range. [...] He was not afraid to pitch inside, and threw strikes to {{both sides of the}} plate. [...] "I'm 6-foot-8 and I keep a high three-quarters arm angle," [...] noted Hirsh. [...] "You figure the mound is a foot and a half, and my arm may be another two, three, four feet. [...] It makes the batter have to look up instead of straight <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> may have a difficult time adjusting." [...] During the 2007 season, Hirsh had trouble throwing his fastball enough. Pitching coach Bob Apodaca gave this assessment of Hirsh before 2008: [...] "All Jason has to do is trust his stuff. [...] He has the type of fastball you work off, but he was using his fastball the way you'd use an off-speed pitch —- to try and trick hitters." ...|$|E
60|$|It was not {{a verbal}} remark, but a {{proceeding}} in dumb-show, and was pointedly addressed to me. He stirred his rum and water pointedly <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> tasted his rum and water pointedly <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> <b>he</b> stirred it and he tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him, but with a file.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's Boom," [...] he said. [...] "Boom and his damned newspapers. He's {{trying to}} fight me down. Ever since I offered to buy the Daily Decorator he's been <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> <b>he</b> thinks {{consolidating}} Do Ut cut down the ads. He wants everything, damn him! He's got no sense of dealing. I'd like to bash his face!" ...|$|E
60|$|He laughed for answer, with {{something}} of exultation in his voice. He swung {{me to his}} shoulder, <b>and</b> held <b>me</b> poised there, looking up <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> then <b>he</b> laughed again.|$|R
6000|$|The giant stood awhile looking <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and,</b> as <b>he</b> stood, Indaba-zimbi {{walked across}} the ring behind me, muttering as he passed, [...] "Keep cool, Macumazahn, and wait for him. I will make it all right." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "People looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> thought, <b>he</b> can't run, he's {{not very}} quick <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> {{not very good}} in the air, so how can he score goals? My answer to that was: 'Just add them {{up at the end}} of the season!" [...] Cullerton answers his critics.|$|R
6000|$|Ae {{man there}} {{in the thick of}} the throng Sat in his saddle, {{straight}} and strong. I looked at him and he <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>And</b> <b>he</b> was a master-man to see. [...] .

6000|$|... "I {{told the}} captain this, {{and he looked}} hard <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> said: 'It will {{take a couple of}} days to mend that leak and to pump out the brig. If this fine weather keeps on I think we can do it in that time. And if while we are working at it you choose {{to try to find out}} more about them two ships, you can do it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The purely animal fury {{of his eye}} {{suddenly}} changed {{again to}} cunning. [...] "You think they hangs me for it, Tommy, but they don't. Not much, Tommy. I goes to the biggest lawyer there, and I says to him, 'Salviated by merkery,--you hear me,--salviated by merkery.' And he winks <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> goes to the judge, and he sez, 'This yer unfortnet man isn't responsible,--he's been salviated by merkery.' And he brings witnesses; you comes, Tommy, and you sez ez how you've seen me took bad afore; and the doctor, he comes, and he sez as how he's seen me frightful; and the jury, without leavin' their seats, brings in a verdict o' justifiable insanity,--salviated by merkery." ...|$|E
6000|$|The old {{man looked}} at him <b>and</b> then <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> laughed. [...] "All right, bub," [...] said he. [...] "If ever you want to hire a boat, I've got one. My name is Menendez. Just ask for my boat at the club-house wharf." [...] <b>And</b> then <b>he</b> went on.|$|R
6000|$|... "A bit," [...] {{she replied}} slowly. [...] "And then he {{seemed as if}} he couldn't get <b>AT</b> <b>me,</b> really. <b>And</b> then <b>he</b> got brutal--he WAS brutal!" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> paused. 'Well,' <b>he</b> went on at last, {{after a long}} interval; 'since {{you insist}} upon it, I will leave the bequest to stand without condition.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Of course, it was {{possible}} that he had not seen me; but for some reason his attitude struck me as ominous. As far as I could see, he was looking straight <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was not a short-sighted man. I could think of no reason why he should cut me. We had met on the links on the previous morning, and he had been friendliness itself. He had called me [...] "me dear boy," [...] supplied me with a gin and gingerbeer at the clubhouse, and generally behaved {{as if he had been}} David and I Jonathan. Yet in certain moods we are inclined to make mountains out of molehills, and I went on my way, puzzled and uneasy, with a distinct impression that I had received the cut direct.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I, Ebbits, journeyed down to Cambell Fort {{to collect}} the debt. Jones, who is chief trader, looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> laughed. He made great laughter, and would not give payment. I went to the medicine-man, what you call missionary, and had large talk about the bad water and the payment that should be mine. And the missionary made talk about other things. He talk about where Moklan has gone, now he is dead. There be large fires in that place, and if missionary make true talk, I know that Moklan will be cold no more. Also the missionary talk about where I shall go when I am dead. And he say bad things. He say that I am blind. Which is a lie. He say that I am in great darkness. Which is a lie. And I say that the day come and the night come for {{everybody}} just the same, and that in my village {{it is no more}} dark than at Cambell Fort. Also, I say that darkness and light and where we go when we die be different things from the matter of payment of just debt for bad water. Then the missionary make large anger, and call me bad names of darkness, and tell me to go away. And so I come back from Cambell Fort, and no payment has been made, and Moklan is dead, and in my old age I am without fish and meat." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the moment}} of my visit to Sheffield, it {{happened}} that many works were running half-time or no time, and many people were out of work. At one place {{there was a little}} oblong building between branching streets, round which sat a miserable company of Murchers, as I heard them called, on long benches under the overhanging roof, who were too obviously, who were almost offensively, out of work. Some were old and some young, some dull and some fierce, some savage and some imbecile in their looks, and they were all stained and greasy and dirty, and looked their apathy or their grim despair. Even the men who were coming to or from their work at dinner-time looked stunted and lean and pale, with no color of that south of England bloom with which they might have favored a stranger. Slatternly girls and women abounded, and little babies carried about by a little larger babies, and of course kissed on their successive layers of dirt. There were also many small boys who, I hope, were not so wicked as they were ragged. At noon-time they hung much about the windows of cookshops which one would think their sharp hunger would have pierced to the steaming and smoking dishes within. The very morning after I had denied that man a penny at the theatre door, and was still smarting to think I had not given him sixpence, I saw a boy of ten, in the cut-down tatters of a man, gloating upon a meat-pie which a cook had cruelly set behind the pane in front of him. I took out the sixpence which I ought to have given that poor man, and made it a shilling, and put it into the boy's wonderfully dirty palm, and bade him go in and get the pie. He looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> looked at the shilling, and then I suppose he did as he was bid. But I ought to say, in justice to myself, that I never did anything of the kind again as long as I remained in Sheffield. I felt that I owed a duty to the place and must not go about corrupting the populace for my selfish pleasure.|$|E
6000|$|Without ceasing to {{converse}} with Mr. Purcey and Signor Egregio Pozzi, she moved her left eye upwards. Mrs. Tallents Smallpeace understood this to mean: 'Be frank, and guarded!' Stephen, however, interpreted it otherwise. To him it signified: 'What the deuce do you look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for?' <b>And</b> <b>he</b> felt justly hurt. He therefore said abruptly: ...|$|R

6000|$|In the parlour, the father, big and comfortable, was {{sleeping}} in an arm-chair. Emily was writing at the table—she hurriedly hid her papers when I entered.

5000|$|The album {{incorporates}} use of wah-wah pedal and fuzzbox. [...] Marshall Chess augmented {{the rhythm}} of Howlin Wolf's live band {{with the use of}} electronic organ and saxophone. Blues purists criticized the album's psychedelic sound. Howlin' Wolf disliked the sound, which he did not consider to be blues. According to guitarist Pete Cosey, during the recording sessions, Howlin' Wolf [...] "looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> said 'Why don't you take them wah-wahs and all that other shit and go throw it off in the lake — on your way to the barber shop?'" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "By the way, {{the morning}} my father made {{the picture of}} JFK at the window, the {{president}} was reading the Times. He had gotten to the editorial page.
