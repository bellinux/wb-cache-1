5|$|The 767 is {{equipped}} with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces, landing gear, and utility <b>actuation</b> systems. Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses electric pumps. A ram air turbine provides power for basic controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. An early form of fly-by-wire is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system reduces weight and allows independent operation of individual spoilers.|$|E
5|$|To {{control the}} engine's output, the MEC {{operates}} five hydraulically actuated propellant valves on each engine; the oxidizer preburner oxidizer, fuel preburner oxidizer, main oxidizer, main fuel, and chamber coolant valves. In an emergency, the valves can be fully closed {{by using the}} engine's helium supply system as a backup <b>actuation</b> system.|$|E
25|$|The primary modern {{mechanical}} <b>actuation</b> mechanism uses brake levers {{coupled to}} Bowden cables to move brake arms, thus forcing pads against a braking surface. Cable mechanisms are usually less expensive, but may require some maintenance related to exposed {{areas of the}} cable. Other mechanical <b>actuation</b> mechanisms exist: see Coaster brakes for back-pedal <b>actuation</b> mechanisms, and Rod-actuated brakes for a mechanism incorporating metal rods. The first Spoon brakes were actuated by a cable that was pulled by twisting {{the end of a}} handlebar.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} influences of electrostatic charge, flow, delay, and multiple <b>actuations</b> on the in vitro delivery of salbutamol generated by a pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) from small volume spacers used in infants. METHODS: Ten <b>actuations</b> from a salbutamol pMDI were drawn at different flow rates after either single or multiple <b>actuations,</b> with or without delay, through either static or reduced static spacers. An ionic detergent was used to reduce the charge of plastic spacers (Babyhaler, Babyspacer, Aerochamber, Nebuhaler). Electrostatic charge was measured using an electrometer. A multistage liquid impinger {{was used to determine}} the particle size distribution of the output of the pMDI through the spacers. RESULTS: Electrostatic charge on the surface of plastic spacers had the greatest influence on delivery, causing a decrease in drug delivery. Reducing charge by coating the surface with ionic detergent resulted in an increase of 46. 5 - 71. 1 % (p < 0. 001) in small (< 6. 8 microns) particle delivery from small volume plastic spacers. Lower flow, delay, and multiple <b>actuations</b> resulted in decreased delivery from static spacers. Lower flow resulted in a decrease of 15 % in small (< 9. 6 microns) particle delivery. Delay and multiple <b>actuations</b> resulted in a decrease of 40. 7 % and 76. 0 %, respectively, in small (< 6. 8 microns) particle delivery. The influences of lower flow, delay, and multiple <b>actuations</b> were greatly reduced or even eliminated by reducing charge. However, multiple <b>actuations</b> still resulted in a significant decreased delivery (p < 0. 05). The reduced static Nebuhaler had a higher delivery than all small volume spacers. CONCLUSIONS: Electrostatic charge has a major influence on the delivery of salbutamol from small volume spacers. Using a metal spacer or ionic detergent coating of plastic spacers resulted in no or reduced charge and hence in improved delivery. Lower flow, delay, and multiple <b>actuations</b> played a major part only in static spacers...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundConsistent {{delivery}} of medication to treat asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) {{is critical for}} disease control. Dose tracking may eliminate the possibility of sub-therapeutic dosing. This study evaluated the overall performance, including accuracy and ruggedness, of the mometasone furoate/formoterol (MF/F) metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with an integrated numerical dose-counting mechanism in adolescent and adult subjects (aged ≥ 12  y) with persistent asthma or COPD. MethodsIn a phase III, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study, subjects demonstrating at least 90 % compliance with MF/F during the screening period received twice daily MF/F MDI 100 / 10  μg with the integrated dose counter for 4 weeks. Accuracy and ruggedness of the dose counter were assessed by the overall discrepancy rate of subject-recorded <b>actuations</b> versus subject-recorded dose counter readings. Discrepancy rates for Counterstrip™, a manual counting method, were evaluated for reference. Compliance and ergonomic safety were also assessed. ResultsThe 233 subjects who used ≥ 90 % of labeled <b>actuations</b> were included in the primary analysis. Of 26, 317 total <b>actuations,</b> 33 dose counter discrepancies occurred (rate =  0. 13 / 100 <b>actuations),</b> of which 13 were due to undercounting. In comparison, the Counterstrip discrepancy rate was 10 -fold higher (1. 34 / 100 <b>actuations).</b> Compliance with medication use, Counterstrip use, and e-diary recordings were all high (> 98 %). No new repetitive strain injuries or exacerbations of preexisting ergonomic injuries of the finger, hand, or arm were reported. ConclusionsThe MF/F MDI dose counter was accurate and rugged in subjects with asthma or COPD. No new repetitive strain injuries or exacerbations of existing ergonomic injuries were associated with inhaler use.

25|$|If {{the front}} brake is mounted behind the fork a {{so-called}} self-assisting effect occurs. The friction force between brake shoe and rim creates a bending moment which presses the shoe even stronger {{on the rim}} thus leading to an amplified brake force.

40|$|This {{document}} contains as a Final Grade Project {{the study}} of the operational security rules at the Barcelona-Bages (LEMS) airdrome for a flight school and for other aerial works. The project is developed in 5 chapters, where altogether describe the reason of the project, the currently airdrome state, the needed requirements to comply with the Operational Security rules, the projections needed to perform in order to comply with the rules, and a study of the costs of the <b>actuations.</b> The project starts with the will of the airdrome owner to start a Flight School during the next years, so a project was needed to evaluate if the equipment follows the Operational Security rules of the National and European Authorities. The study is based at the airdrome air zone, where after detailing the dimensions, the currently installed equipment and signals, some operational security discrepancies were found that must be projected and solved. The planned <b>actuations</b> are the relocation of the wind markers, the correct signing of the non-paved runway, the runway side strip marking, and the fire extinguishers acquisition. Otherwise, as a project to asphalt the runway, the taxiway and the apron that already exists, the projection of the marking of these paved surfaces has been also included in this document. All the projections that are quoted and planned will be available for the owner, so he can decide whether to perform part of the <b>actuations</b> for the non-paved airdrome or otherwise, to perform the full <b>actuations</b> on the airdrome surface to pave them and comply with the Operational Security rules...|$|R

25|$|These brakes {{are simple}} and {{effective}} for relatively narrow tyres but have significant flex and resulting poor performance if the arms are made {{long enough to}} fit wide tyres.
