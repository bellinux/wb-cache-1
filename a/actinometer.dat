A moveable arm carrying a brass plate with a slit and a vernier, enables the observer to read off at the vanishing point of the sun's limb, to one five-hundredth of an inch. I generally took the mean of five readings as one, and the mean of five of these again I regarded as one observation; but I place little dependence upon the results.

As far as {{the effects of the}} sun's light on vegetation are concerned, I am inclined to think that it is of more importance to register the number of hours or rather of parts of each hour, that the sun shines, and its clearness during the time.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of drugs}} photodegradation {{have traditionally been}} treated using thermal kinetic analysis methods consisting most commonly in zero and first order kinetics. These treatment strategies were shown to lack specificity and present a number of limitations when applied to photoreactions kinetics. Nevertheless, these methods have widely been used {{due to a lack}} of integrated rate-laws for the majority of photoreactions types, in turn, due to the presence of a variable time-dependent factor in most photoreactions rate-laws that prevents their mathematical integration. To address these limitations, a new methodology for the development and validation of semi-empirical integrated rate-laws that faithfully describe photoreactions kinetics and photoreactions simulated cases generated by numerical integration methods (NIMs), is hereby presented. Using this methodology, a new kinetic order was ascribed to photoreactions namely the Φ-order kinetics. Semi-empirical integrated rate-laws were, thus, developed for three photoreaction types namely, unimolecular, AB(1 Φ), photoreversible,AB(2 Φ), and consecutive, AB 4 (4 Φ), photoreactions. The proposed models were further tested experimentally on drugs following these photodegradation mechanisms using; nifedipine and nisoldipine for unimolecular photoreactions; montelukast and fluvoxamine for photoreversible reactions; and riboflavin for consecutive photoreactions. The developed models not only accurately described the photoreaction kinetics of these drugs but also allowed the determination of all the kinetic parameters that characterise them.

60|$|The {{observations}} {{for solar}} radiation were {{taken with a}} black-bulb thermometer, and also with <b>actinometers,</b> but {{the value of the}} data afforded by the latter not being fixed or comparative, I shall give the results in a separate section. (See Appendix K.) From a multitude of desultory observations, I conclude that at 7,400 feet, 125.7 degrees, or + 67 degrees above the temperature of the air, is the average maximum effect of the sun's rays on a black-bulb thermometer* [From the mean of very many observations, I find that 10 degrees is the average difference {{at the level of the}} sea, in India, between two similar thermometers, with spherical bulbs (half-inch diam.), the one of black, and the other of plain glass, and both being equally exposed to the sun's rays.] throughout the year, amounting rarely to + 70 degrees and + 80 degrees in the summer months, but more frequently in the winter or spring. These results, though greatly above what are obtained at Calcutta, are not much, if at all, above what may be observed on the plains of India. This effect is much increased with the elevation. At 10,000 feet in December, at 9 a.m., I saw the mercury mount to 132 degrees with a difl: of + 94 degrees, whilst the temperature of shaded snow hard by was 22 degrees; at 13,100 feet, in January, at 9 a.m., it has stood at 98 degrees, diff. + 68.2 degrees; and at 10 a.m., at 114 degrees, diff. + 81.4 degrees, whilst the radiating thermometer on the snow had fallen at sunrise to 0.7 degree. In December, at 13,500 feet, I have seen it 110 degrees, diff. + 84 degrees; at 11 a.m., 11,500 feet; 122 degrees, diff: + 82 degrees. This is but a small selection from many instances of the extraordinary power of solar radiation in the coldest months, at great elevations.|$|R
40|$|This study aims at {{tackling}} some of {{the problems}} often encountered in photostability testing and liquid formulation development. Three anti-cancer drugs will be employed as models; Dacarbazine (DBZ) has well established photostability issues, Axitinib (AXI) and Sunitinib (SUT) are two new drugs only commercially available in solid dosage forms. In ethanol, the photokinetics of these drugs were well described by the newly proposed Φ-order kinetic mathematical model. This has confirmed the photoreversible character of AXI and SUT’s and unimolecular photoreaction of DBZ’s photodegradations. Also, the Φ-order kinetics is proven to describe them better than the usually used classic thermal reaction orders. In aqueous solution, the drugs were found to undergo thermal and photochemical complex degradations, involving at least 3 photoproducts. A new photokinetic approach has been proposed in this work to solving and unravelling the attributes of such complex mechanisms. For the first time, the quantum yields (QY) of the three drugs were determined and found to increase with irradiation wavelength. SUT’s QY were comparable in ethanol and water (QY 460 = 0. 02), DBZ was found to be more photoefficient in water (QY 330 = 0. 04 and 0. 1, respectively) and AXI in water (QY 330 = 0. 06 and 0. 03). Φ-order kinetics’ potential for the development of reliable <b>actinometers</b> of the three drugs, without prior knowledge of unknown reaction parameters, has also been established. A general equation to describe the isotherm of a (Gn:Hm) guest-host multicomponent complex was proposed in this work to palliate the lack of a strategy for characterising nanosponge-drug complexes. It provides information on both stiochiometry and association constant of the complex. The results indicate that hydrophobic AXI forms a 1 : 0. 8 complex, indicating the possibility of multiple association sites and/or different types of binding. The newly developed AXI/nanosponge liquid formulation has significantly increased solubility (5000 -fold) and thermal stability. Furthermore, the photostability of DBZ and SUT were considerably improved by using a strategy based on light-absorption competitors. Their initial velocities reduced from 10 and 3 s- 1 (respectively) to 1 and 0. 13 s- 1. The successful application of these methods to the model anti-cancer drugs has set out new approaches that might be found useful for future treatments of photodegradation data, development of drug-actinometers and liquid formulations of drugs...|$|R
