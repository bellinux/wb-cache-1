In this sense, the study objective was to identify main critical factors and technology demands and public policy to improve the competitiveness of the milk <b>agro-alimentary</b> <b>chain</b> from cow's milk in the Hidalgo state. Through a forum with various actors in the chain were validated and prioritized 12 critical factors, likewise its causes were identified and subsequently their demands. Were identified 19 demands; 10 to technological area, 7 demands of political and 2 of knowledge. Through literature review was identify the available technology for the settlement of claims raised, we found a total of 286 titles mostly for the primary link. It was identified {{that much of the}} technology and knowledge demands can be covered by the available supply, while for the politics demands there is not information that might fill them. In conclusion, most be work on developing public policies based on what raised by those attending the forum, in to train to producers and in the process of technology transfer, to guarantee that the technology generated in the centers and research institutions and education reaches the <b>agro-alimentary</b> <b>chain</b> links from cow's milk in Hidalgo state. Demands catch, milk <b>agro-alimentary</b> <b>chain,</b> technological supply, critics factors., Agribusiness,...|$|E
40|$|Geographical Information Systems {{have proved}} to be since years, with {{extremely}} significant results, among the most common and efficient tools for territorial planning activities. There are several applications and fields in which GIS have been used, among these the studies on environmental impact assessment and environmental sensibilities of the territory are of great importance. The present work has been carried out within the Agrieco Project, financed by the Forlì-Cesena province and the Emilia-Romagna region, whose aim, in its first phase, is to guide a group of enterprises of the <b>agro-alimentary</b> supply <b>chain</b> to obtain the certification of their environmental management systems according to the EMAS II or ISO 14001 standards. A study on environmental sensibility has been carried out to single out the more sensible áreas towards some of the more important factors of environmental pressure. The use of a GIS allowed superimposing the information concerning the studied área and thus drawing updated indications on the environmental situation. The aim was essentially to determinate, through the superimposition of information layers such as slopes, pedology and land use, the loss of soil due to erosive phenomena. The study has had a potential character but gives anyhow useful indications to plan interventions on the territory. The environmental receptors that form the used layers have been carefully evaluated and a weight quantifying the receptor’s relevance towards the erosive phenomenon has been given to each receptor using the AHP method (Analytic Hierarchy Process). The superimposition of the information through an overlay process has given a thematic map with the distribution of the territory’s potential erosion...|$|R
