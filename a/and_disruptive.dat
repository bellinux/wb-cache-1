5|$|Ashley Smith (born 29 January 1988, New Brunswick, Canada) {{was adopted}} {{when she was}} 5 days old, and {{according}} to her adoptive parents, Coralee Smith and Herbert Gober, had a normal childhood in Moncton, New Brunswick. Between the ages of 13-14, her parents noted distinct behavioural changes in the child; by age 15 she had been before juvenile court 14 times for various minor offences such as throwing crabapples at a mailman, trespassing, and causing a disturbance. In March 2002, Smith was assessed by a psychologist who {{found no evidence of}} mental illness. However, her behavioural problems continued and she was suspended from school multiple times in the fall of 2002. In March 2003, after multiple court appearances, Smith was admitted to the Pierre Caissie Centre for assessment. She was diagnosed with ADHD, learning disorder, borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality traits. She was discharged several days early from the Centre for unruly <b>and</b> <b>disruptive</b> behaviour and returned to the New Brunswick Youth Centre (NBYC). Smith was remanded to the NBYC multiple times over the next 3 years; during this time she was involved in more than 800 reported incidents and at least 150 attempts to physically harm herself.|$|E

This area was formerly called Understanding <b>and</b> Managing <b>Disruptive</b> <b>and</b> Transformational Technologies. Major technological changes unleash large-scale social, cultural, economic and political consequences. Digitized computing is the most recent example of disruptive technology; the wheel could be {{regarded as one of the}} earliest. MU's collaborative work across all fields—including the social sciences and the humanities—will advance research, education and economic development as scientists and scholars study how current technologies fundamentally change in these rapidly evolving times...|$|R

25|$|Of {{fundamentally}} {{greater importance}} was {{the role of}} the middle nobility, propertied and better qualified people, able to pursue careers within magnate courts, or assume public offices obtained with the help of their magnate benefactors.

25|$|Leucophores, usually located {{deeper in}} the skin than iridophores, are also {{structural}} reflectors utilizing crystalline purines, often guanine, to reflect light. Unlike iridophores, however, leucophores have more organized crystals that reduce diffraction. Given a source of white light, they produce a white shine, in red they produce red and in blue they produce blue. Leucophores assist in camouflage by providing light areas during background matching (e.g. by resembling light-colored objects in the environment) <b>and</b> <b>disruptive</b> coloration (by making the body appear to be composed of high-contrasting patches).|$|E

25|$|By 1742, {{the revival}} had entered {{a more radical}} <b>and</b> <b>disruptive</b> phase. Lay people became more active {{participants}} in the services by crying out, exhorting, or having visions. Uneducated men and women began to preach without formal training, and some itinerant preachers were active in parishes without {{the approval of the}} local pastor. Enthusiasts even claimed that many of the clergy were unconverted themselves and thus unqualified to be ministers. Congregationalists split into Old Lights and New Lights over the Awakening, with Old Lights opposing it and New Lights supporting it.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} design and cinematography also won some praise from critics. Claire Sisco King called {{the use of}} real footage unconventional <b>and</b> <b>disruptive</b> in a positive way. The editing was described as akin {{to that of a}} music video, and critic Laura Kern found it effectively paced. Michael Koresky described Joey's death scene in the red-drenched bathroom very effectively staged, although Peter Hartlaub found that the lighting obscured the action rather than enhancing it. Except for the strobe light effects during Chaz's death and the moment when the killer's scythe touches Eddie's glass eye, Kern found the special effects only average.|$|E
25|$|Africa has a {{population}} of roughly 1.02 billion and a surface of 30,221,532 km². Industrialization started marginally in the early 20th century in the colonies of the European nations, namely Portugal, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The continent's various wars for independence brought on the violent <b>and</b> <b>disruptive</b> division of Africa. Africa, being a major source of raw materials, saw the colonial powers vie for influence among the newly independent nations, with former colonial powers establishing special relations with their former colonies, often by offering economic aid and alliances for access to the vast resources of their former territories.|$|E

25|$|The Xiongnu were a {{confederation}} of nomadic tribes from Central Asia with {{a ruling}} class of unknown origin and other subjugated tribes. They {{lived on the}} Mongolian Plateau between the 3rd century BC and the 460s AD, their territories including modern day Mongolia, southern Siberia, western Manchuria, and the modern Chinese provinces of Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Xinjiang. The Xiongnu was the first unified empire of nomadic peoples. Relations between early Chinese dynasties and the Xiongnu were complicated and included military conflict, exchanges of tribute and trade, and marriage treaties. They were considered so dangerous <b>and</b> <b>disruptive</b> that the Qin Dynasty ordered {{the construction of the}} Great Wall to protect China from Xiongnu attacks.|$|E
25|$|The film is stunningly {{beautiful}} at times, and wildly ambitious, {{an attempt}} to be both wordless and wordy, {{to get to the}} hypnotic state that poetry and music can induce while saying something meaningful about black and white attitudes to land and love. This last part, as I read Murray, is largely imposed <b>and</b> <b>disruptive,</b> trying to pin a romantic political agenda to the work that's hardly there. It makes the film too literal, too current, when it wants to lodge itself in the more mysterious part of the brain. The film still has a power – Haywood's performance is magnificent – but it never achieves a strong inner reality. It falls short of its own tall ambitions.|$|E
25|$|After Villa {{successfully}} {{captured the}} strategic prize of Torreón, Carranza ordered Villa {{to break off}} action south of Torreón and instead to divert to attack Saltillo. He threatened to cut off Villa's coal supply, immobilizing his supply trains, {{if he did not}} comply. This was widely seen as an attempt by Carranza to divert Villa from a direct assault on Mexico City in order to allow Carranza's forces under Álvaro Obregón, driving in from the west via Guadalajara, to take the capital first. This was an expensive <b>and</b> <b>disruptive</b> diversion for the División del Norte. Villa's enlisted men were not unpaid volunteers but paid soldiers, earning the then enormous sum of one peso per day. Each day of delay cost thousands of pesos.|$|E

25|$|Ibrahim is {{believed}} to have ordered and helped organise the bombings in Mumbai, through one of his subordinates, Tiger Memon. The bombings are also believed to have been financially assisted by the expatriate Indian smugglers, Hajji Ahmed, Hajji Umar and Taufiq Jaliawala, as well as the Pakistani smugglers, Aslam Bhatti and Dawood Jatt. The Indian authorities have also alleged the involvement of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, in the blasts. On 16 June 2017 giving its verdict in the 1993 Mumbai bomb-blast case, a Special Terrorism <b>and</b> <b>Disruptive</b> Activities Act court pronounced gangster Mustafa Dossa and Firoz Khan guilty of conspiracy. The charges can draw the punishment of the death penalty. Accused Abu Salem also got convicted under charges of conspiracy and terror activities.|$|E
25|$|The {{common law}} is more {{malleable}} than statutory law. First, common law courts are not absolutely bound by precedent, but can (when extraordinarily good reason is shown) reinterpret and revise the law, without legislative intervention, {{to adapt to}} new trends in political, legal and social philosophy. Second, the common law evolves {{through a series of}} gradual steps, that gradually works out all the details, so that over a decade or more, the law can change substantially but without a sharp break, thereby reducing disruptive effects. In contrast to common law incrementalism, the legislative process is very difficult to get started, as legislatures tend to delay action until a situation is totally intolerable. For these reasons, legislative changes tend to be large, jarring <b>and</b> <b>disruptive</b> (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively, and sometimes with unintended consequences).|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the conspirators}} {{who managed to}} flee out of India after the bombings were arrested and extradited to India later on.

Abu Salem, Mustafa Dossa, Firoz Khan, Taher Merchant, Riyaz Siddiqui, Karimullah Khan,and Abdul Qayoom amongst others were arrested and trial continued against these absconders in a special TADA court in Mumbai. Ujjwal Nikam who was earlier the Special Prosecutor in these case was later on replaced by Deepak Salvi to continue with the trial in the light of the subsequent developments. On 16 June 2017,a Special Terrorism <b>and</b> <b>Disruptive</b> Activities Act court Giving its verdict in the 1993 Mumbai serial bomb blast case, pronounced gangster Mustafa Dossa and Firoz Khan guilty of conspiracy.The charges can draw the punishment of the death penalty.
