5|$|Sodium atoms have 11 electrons, {{one more}} than the {{extremely}} stable configuration of the noble gas neon. Because of this and its low first ionization energy of 495.8 kJ/mol, the sodium atom {{is much more likely}} to lose the last electron and <b>acquire</b> <b>a</b> positive charge than to gain one and <b>acquire</b> <b>a</b> negative charge. This process requires so little energy that sodium is readily oxidized by giving up its 11th electron. In contrast, the second ionization energy is very high (4562 kJ/mol), because the 10th electron is closer to the nucleus than the 11th electron. As a result, sodium usually forms ionic compounds involving the Na+ cation.|$|E
