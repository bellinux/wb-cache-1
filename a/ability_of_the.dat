5|$|Approximately 1000 {{passengers}} {{were trapped in}} darkness for several hours inside two Eurostar trains {{on the night of}} 19/20 February 1996. The trains stopped inside the tunnels due to electronic failures caused by snow and ice.

5|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity {{depend on the}} <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immune system to distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E

The radar systems were completed in late 1966 with the fourth Dnestr at Balkhash being used for testing.

5|$|From the 1986–87 season, {{the club}} {{finishing}} {{bottom of the}} Football League's basement division was relegated to the Conference National (now National League), {{the highest level of}} non-League football, depending on the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Conference champions to meet FA requirements. Before this, clubs would lose their League status by failing to gain re-election after finishing in the bottom four of the bottom division. Since the 2002–03 season, the bottom two clubs of League Two face relegation to the Conference/National League.|$|E

Furthermore, Admiral Benson was uneasy about the prospect, ever-present in the early 20th century, of a second war breaking out with Japan. For the moment, the U.S. Navy would send destroyers to Europe, but no battleships.|$|E

5|$|Some valkyrie names may be {{descriptive}} of {{the roles}} and abilities of the valkyries.

The name Herfjötur has been theorised as pointing to the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valkyries to place fetters.

5|$|The {{ability of}} birds to {{navigate}} during migrations cannot be fully explained by endogenous programming, {{even with the}} help of responses to environmental cues. The ability to successfully perform long-distance migrations can probably only be fully explained with an accounting for the cognitive <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> birds to recognize habitats and form mental maps. Satellite tracking of day migrating raptors such as ospreys and honey buzzards has shown that older individuals are better at making corrections for wind drift.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{director}} to align along an external field {{is caused by}} the electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.|$|E
