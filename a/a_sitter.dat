25|$|Andrew Strauss {{failed to}} proved himself {{again with a}} second ball lbw, falling for {{successive}} double-digit scores {{for the first time}} in 35 Test matches, leaving No. 3 Vaughan to effectively open once more. With the total on 28, and both batsmen with two fours to their name, Denesh Ramdin threw up the ball after an appeal off Cook, who scurried for a single in the confusion. Cook was awarded a run, though as the ball hadn't hit bat and he wasn't caught behind, it was eventually a bye. Then, Ramdin let slip <b>a</b> <b>sitter</b> through his legs which went on to hit his helmet, boosting the English with a mandatory five penalty runs before the second day's play ended.|$|E
25|$|Abramovic {{sat in a}} {{rectangle}} drawn with tape in {{the floor of the}} second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on her sitting in a chair and a chair opposite her. Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained eye contact with them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to rush for a more preferable place in the line to sit with Abramovic. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less and the line attracted no attention from museum security except for {{the last day of the}} exhibition when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovic, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovic wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if <b>a</b> <b>sitter</b> cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovic sat across from 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed and Bjork; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramovic concluded the performance by slipping from the chair where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep.|$|E

500|$|Writing in {{the journal}} for the Society for Psychical Research, Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo {{described}} a letter by Dr. Barthez, a physician {{in the court of}} Empress Eugenie, which claimed <b>a</b> <b>sitter</b> Morio de l'lle caught Home using his foot to fake supposed spirit effects during a séance in Biarritz in 1857. Home wore thin shoes, easy to take off and draw on, and also cut socks that left the toes free. [...] "At the appropriate moment he takes off one of his shoes and with his foot pulls a dress here, a dress there, rings a bell, knocks one way and another, and, the thing done, quickly puts his shoe on again." [...] Home positioned himself between the empress and Napoleon III. One of the séance sitters known as General Fleury also suspected that Home was utilizing trickery and asked to leave but returned unobserved to watch from another door behind Home. He saw Home slip his foot from his shoe and touch the arm of the Empress, who believed it to be one of her dead children. The observer stepped forward and revealed the fraud, and Home was conducted out of the country: [...] "The order was to keep the incident secret." [...] The allegations described by Dr. Barthez and General Fleury are second hand and have caused dispute between psychical researchers and skeptics.|$|E
