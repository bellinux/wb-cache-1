Brüel&Kjær PULSE™, Multi-analyzer System Type 3560 was used in the analysis. The operating frequency ranges in case of Los Angels <b>Abrasion</b> <b>Machine</b> is found to be 48 Hz – first frequency and 73 Hz – second frequency. In case of Jaw Crushing Machine is 42. 2 Hz – first frequency and 71. 8 Hz – second frequency. Where as, in case of steel flat the operating frequency is found to be 41. 50 Hz. The fiber reinforced glass composites were decreased in area in a regular pattern and the pattern of frequency variation was observed. In case of 16 layers the first frequency decreased from 284 Hz – 236 Hz and the second frequency also depicted similar pattern. In case of 12 layers the first frequency decreased from 190 Hz – 160 Hz and the second frequency varied from 588 Hz – 390 Hz. The observed trend is justified as the value of K decreases as we decrease the area of the sample. We have also studied the determination of Buckling load from frequency study incase of a steel flat. When steel flat is subjected to increasing axial load the operating frequency is observed to decrease. When this operating frequency tends to zero the axial load nears the buckling load of that structure. 30 cm steel flat is tested in a UTM under increasing axial load. The initial frequency under no load condition is 260 Hz. Under a load of 0. 4 ton the first frequency decreases to 168 Hz. Extrapolating the decreasing trend we get the buckling load as 1. 1739 ton. A similar trend was observed in case of second frequencies. The vibration analysis of the foundations of various machines will help us in designing them such that their serviceability is increased.

Methods. Fifteen experimental composites and 15 corresponding copolymers were prepared combining bis-GMA and TEGDMA, CH 3 bis-GMA or CF 3 bis-GMA, with aldehyde (24 mol% and 32 mol%) or diketone (24 mol% and 32 mol%) totaling 30 groups. For composites, hybrid treated filler (barium aluminosilicate glass/pyrogenic silica; 60 wt%) was added to monomer mixtures. Photopolymerization was affected by 0. 2 wt% each of camphorquinone and N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine. Wear (W) test was conducted in a toothbrushing <b>abrasion</b> <b>machine</b> (n = 6) and quantified using a profilometer. Surface roughness (R) changes, before and after abrasion test, were determined using a rugosimeter. Microhardness (H) measurements were performed for dry and wet samples using a Knoop microindenter (n = 6). Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey`s test (alpha = 0. 05). Results. Incorporation of additives led to improved W and H values for bis-GMA/TEGDMA and bis-GMA/CH(3) bis-GMA systems. Additives had no {{significant effect on the}} W and H changes of bis-GMA/CF(3) bis-GMA.

40|$|Motorcycle crashes {{represent}} a significant health burden to the community, accounting for 22 % of serious casualties on Australian roads each year. In addition, {{it is well}} known and accepted that motorcyclists are significantly overrepresented in crashes given that motorcycle usage accounts for only one percent of vehicle kilometres travelled (ATC, 2011; BITRE, 2009). Soft tissue injuries are the most common injuries experienced by crashed motorcyclists (NSAI, 1998, 2003, 2010). Protective clothing has been developed to help prevent these injuries, yet the performance of protective clothing in Australia is still variable (de Rome et al., 2011). In Australia, while there are no design standards for motorcycle protective clothing, there are non-mandatory Australian Guidelines for manufacturing. However, the guidelines specify the use of an <b>abrasion</b> testing <b>machine</b> which is not designed for the purpose of testing motorcycle protective clothing. Therefore, at present in Australia, there are no mechanisms in place to help maintain a high quality of performance. There is a European Standard for motorcycle protective clothing and this Standard specifies the general requirements for clothing intended to protect the rider against mechanical injury. This Standard (EN 13595) was developed from work undertaken by Woods who examined crash damage to 100 motorcycle suits (99 leather and 1 Kevlar) and observed where damage most frequently occurred as well as the type of damage. Based on the damage distribution, a clothing template was developed that specified four zones, each with different levels of protection dependent upon the clothing’s ability to resist the main types of damage: burst, cut, abrasion and tear. (Woods, 1996 a, 1996 b). It is still unknown how well the performance of materials in the laboratory tests of EN 13595 relates to the performance of clothing in real world motorcycle crashes. With a larger variety of fabrics currently available to motorcycle riders, the performance of clothing in the real world may have varied since Woods developed the Cambridge <b>Abrasion</b> <b>machine</b> in 1996. There is a need to validate the observations on which the EU Standard requirements are based, particularly using a greater range of materials and more modern materials. Additionally, there has been no study since the work of Woods (Woods, 1996 b) that examines the adequacy of the test methods. The objective {{of this study was to}} address this gap and, as abrasion resistance is considered to be the highest priority compared to other damage types (Meredith, Brown, Ivers, & de Rome, 2013), this study set out to determine whether the approach taken to assess abrasion resistance in the EU Standard is appropriate. Specifically, the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the abrasion resistance performance of the clothing worn by the motorcycle riders when tested as required in EN 13595 and the probability of real world injury outcome.

40|$|Motorcyclists are {{the fastest}} growing sector of road users {{globally}} and represent an increasing proportion of road crash casualties. Few gains in motorcycle rider protection have been made, and as such, there is limited protection available for motorcyclists. Passive protective measures for motorcycle riders have focussed on helmets and protective clothing, {{but there is still}} progress to be made in terms of the performance of this clothing. Additionally, the pelvic region is a frequently injured body region and currently there is no protection provided for this body region. This thesis presents five inter-related studies addressing the gaps in motorcycle rider protection. Methods used included retrospective review of motorcycle crashes, in-depth crash investigation and mechanical testing. Descriptive and nonparametric statistical analysis techniques were used. The results indicated that while protective clothing can help prevent rider injury, the quality of clothing is variable. They confirmed that the EU Standard for motorcycle clothing is an appropriate approach to assessing the quality of motorcycle clothing, but minor modifications are recommended to the clothing template and consideration should be given to inclusion of requirements for lining materials. The results also indicate that the Cambridge <b>abrasion</b> <b>machine</b> effectively assesses and ranks the performance of motorcycle clothing and longer abrasion times result in a reduced probability of injury. However, the abrasion performance requirements of EN 13595 may be set too low. The relatively poor abrasion resistance performance of clothing currently being worn by Australian motorcyclists observed in this body of work indicates the need form of quality control or a performance rating system of the clothing. One in five riders sustain pelvic injuries, yet this body region currently remains unprotected. These injuries are commonly due to contact with the motorcycle fuel tank and display patterns associated with frontal loading. These injuries could be minimised through appropriate fuel tank design, rider clothing or motorcycle airbags but the tank features causing these injuries remain to be identified. The results suggest that fuel tank angle and the type of motorcycle may have a role to play...|$|R

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Background: Since the {{introduction}} of glass ionomer cements (GICs) in the 1970 s, many {{attempts have been made}} to improve them and expand their application in restorative dentistry. Recently, GC America introduced a new glass ionomer restorative system called EQUIA. The manufacturer claims that this material has improved wear resistance by coating the surface of high-strength GIC with a nano-filled resin coating. Objective: The objective of this study was to measure the wear resistance and hardness of EQUIA and to compare it to other current restorative materials. Materials and Methods: Four different materials were used in this study: EQUIA, Fuji IX GP Extra, Fuji II LC and Z- 100. Six specimens of each material were made and then tested in a toothbrush <b>abrasion</b> <b>machine</b> for 20, 400 cycles, after which the amount of volume loss was calculated. Eight specimens of each material were made and tested in a three-body Alabama wear testing machine under a load of 75 N for 400, 000 cycles. Four surface profiles were obtained from each specimen and volume loss was calculated using computer software. Five specimens of each material were made and Knoop microhardness was determined by using the mean of the three values from the top surface of the specimen. Results of each test were collected and compared with the other materials using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at a significance level of 0. 05. Results: Wear-resistance results showed that EQUIA has wear-resistance values comparable to composite resin and higher values than those for the high-strength GIC. The results also showed that Fuji II LC had the highest wear among all tested materials. Microhardness results showed that EQUIA has significantly lower microhardness than Fuji IX GP Extra and Z- 100. Conclusion: Based on the results of the present study, it can be concluded that coating the surface of glass ionomer restorations with a nano-filled resin coat results in increasing the wear resistance and decreasing the microhardness of the material. Within the limitations of this study, EQUIA has comparable wear resistance to composite resin...|$|R

A custom made National Instruments LabView program is used to control, monitor and log the activities in the abrasion laboratory. Ice abrasion testing has been done at the NTNU Ice Abrasion Laboratory, investigating a possible difference in abrasion rate for identical concrete with unlike initial treatment. A total of four concretes sample were tested. All four of them were saturated after this saturation period 2 of them was abrasion tested directly and 2 of them were dried, resaturated and then abrasion tested. Abrasion results were distorted by cracking of the concrete samples. No conclusive data on the abrasion rate were obtained. Two possible reasons for cracking of the concrete samples were found.

During abrasion material removal occurred by cracking and detachment from the matrix of eutectic carbides as well as by penetration and micromachining effects of the abrasive grits being crushed at the wearing surface. Under the particular test conditions used martensitic matrix structures gave higher resistance to abrasion than austenitic or pearlitic. However, no simple relationship was found between general hardness or matrix microhardness at wear surfaces and abrasion resistance, and the test yielded pessimistic results for austenitic irons. The fine structures of the 15 % Cr and 30 % Cr alloys were studied by thin foil transmission electron microscopy. It was found that both the matrix and carbide constituents could be thinned for examination at 100 Kv using conventional dishing followed by ion beam thinning.

40|$|International audienceDiscrete Model {{is based}} on the {{description}} of the physical state (velocity, position, temperature, magnetic moment, electric potential [...] ) {{of a large number of}} discrete elements that form the media to be studied. It is not based on a continuous description of the media. Then, it is particularly well adapted to describe media evolution driven by discontinuous phenomena : - multi fracturation problems like abrasion process and composite machining, - description of multi fracturation followed by debris flow like wear study Recently, the use of discrete model has been widened to face problem encountered with complex rheological behavior and/or multi-physical behavior. Multi-physical problems face complex mathematical formulation because of the mixing of different families of differential equations when continuous approach is chosen. With the discrete model, each particle has a physical state and state evolution is due to local physical particle interaction: it is often much simple to write. Some attempt to study complex multi-physical problems has been recently presented: - thermal study of a contact and how dissymmetry appears in an apparently symmetrical problem, - study of Friction Stir Welding. This work outlines how discrete element model can be a useful tool in the simulation of material forming. Example is given on <b>abrasion</b> process and <b>machining</b> of composite...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Cigarette {{production}} lines are automatic production equipments with high efficiency. Glue rolls {{are the key}} parts of cigarette {{production lines}}. The surfaces of the glue rolls will be worn by friction because of continuous running of production lines. Traditional glue rolls with the materials of 4 Cr 13 and 9 Cr 18 possess weak wear resistance and short durability. And {{this leads to the}} stop of the production lines and causes enormous economic losses. This paper makes investigations on cigarette production lines and develops three kinds of new-style glue rolls: SiC chemical composite plating glue rolls, TiN ion plating glue rolls and ZrO 2 ceramic glue rolls with fine grains; a friction and <b>abrasion</b> characteristics experiment <b>machine</b> tool is developed to make comparison and testing between new-style glue rolls and traditional ones. Calculate formulation of wear volume is deduced according to wear marks. And practical software is programmed; Based on the facts above, a series of systemic comparison experiments about the friction and wear characteristics of the several kinds of glue rolls are performed. It is showed through a great deal of experiment data that three kinds of new-style rolls have high surface hardness, upstanding capability of wear resistance and long durability. ZrO 2 ceramic glue roll has the best capability of wear resistance and its durability is about 10 times of that of traditional ones. The capability of wear resistance of SiC chemical composit...|$|R
40|$|High speed milling {{of various}} {{proportions}} Al 2 O 3 particles reinforced aluminum-based Metal Matrix Composites (MMC) by coated carbide tools under different cutting fluid application conditions {{is presented in}} this paper. It is found that Built-Up Edge (BUE) formed easily in high speed dry milling of 10 wt% Al 2 O 3 aluminum MMCs. The chip welding is significantly reduced and a better workpiece surface finish and lowering cutting force is achieved together with negligibly small tool wear under wet cutting and MQL (minimum quantity lubrication). Hence a very high cutting speed together with MQL is recommended to cut this type of MMCs. High speed dry milling of 15 wt% Al 2 O 3 aluminum MMCs generates few BUE but accompanied with serious wear of the tool by <b>abrasion.</b> A better <b>machined</b> surface finish and an increased tool life than those under dry cutting and wet cutting are resulted when MQL is applied. Permeation of the oil mist to wet tool-chip interface is responsible for these advantageous effects. On the contrary, the wear due to the increasing amount of Al 2 O 3 reinforced particles is so serious {{that there is little}} improvement in tool wear and workpiece surface finish in the machining of 20 wt% Al 2 O 3 aluminum MMCs under MQL condition. In summary, high cutting speed with the aid of MQL is appropriate in machining aluminum MMCs containing fewer reinforced particles. Aluminum MMCs with reinforced particles content higher than 20 wt% should be cut at a lower cutting speed...|$|R

40|$|Industrial {{machines}} {{during their}} operation generate vibration due to dynamic forces {{acting on the}} machines. This vibration may create noise, <b>abrasion</b> in the <b>machine</b> parts, mechanical fatigue, degrade performance, transfer to other machines via floor or walls and may cause complete shutdown of the machine. To limit the vibration pre-installation, vibration isolation measures are usually employed in workshops and industrial units. However, such vibration isolation may not be sufficient due to varying operating and physical conditions, such as machine ageing, structural changes and new installations etc. Therefore, {{it is important to}} assess the quantity of vibration generated and transmitted during true operating conditions. The thesis work is aimed at the estimation of vibrational transmissibility or transfer from industrial machines to floor and to other adjacent installed machines. This study of transmissibility is based on the measurement and analysis of various spectral estimation tools such as Power Spectral Density (PSD), Frequency Response Function (FRF) and Coherence Function. The overall study is divided into three major steps. Firstly, the initial measurements are carried in BTH on simple Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) systems to gain confidence in measurement and analysis. Then the measurements are performed on a Lathe machine “Quick Turn Nexus 300 -II” in a laboratory at BTH. Finally, the measurements are taken on the machines of an Industrial workshop (KOSAB). The analysis results revealed that vibration measurements in industry are challenging and not easy as measurement in labs. Measurements are contaminated by noise from other machines, which degrade the coherence function. However, vibration transferred from one machine to the floor or other machines may be studied using FRF and PSD. Appropriate further isolations may be employed based on the spectral analysis...|$|R
