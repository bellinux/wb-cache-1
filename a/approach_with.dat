In addition, he survived a crash during World War II as a passenger in a Miles Master.|$|E

5|$|Born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary (now Austria), Cartier {{initially}} {{studied to}} become an architect, before changing career paths and enrolling to study drama at the Vienna Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. There he was taught by Max Reinhardt, who proved {{a major influence on}} Cartier. Reinhardt thought of a script as being similar to a musical score, which should be interpreted by a director {{in the same way as}} a musician interpreting a piece of music—an <b>approach</b> <b>with</b> which Cartier agreed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} six decades of the republic, between 1923 and 1983, Turkey {{generally}} adhered to a quasi-statist <b>approach</b> <b>with</b> strict government planning of the budget and government-imposed limitations over foreign trade, flow of foreign currency, foreign direct investment and private sector participation in certain fields (such as broadcasting, telecommunications, energy, mining, etc.). However, in 1983, Prime Minister Turgut Özal initiated a series of reforms designed to shift the economy from a statist, insulated system to a more private-sector, market-based model.|$|E

40|$|Approaches to {{multimedia}} search often evolve {{from existing}} <b>approaches</b> <b>with</b> strong average precision. However, work on search evaluation shows that average precision {{does not always}} capture effectiveness in terms of satisfying user needs because it ignores the diversity of search results. This paper investigates whether search <b>approaches</b> <b>with</b> diverse results have been neglected within the multimedia retrieval research agenda due {{the fact that they}} are overshadowed by search <b>approaches</b> <b>with</b> strong average precision. To this end, we compare 361 search approaches applied on the TrecVid benchmarks between 2005 and 2007. We motivate two criteria based on measure correlation and statistical equivalence to estimate whether search <b>approaches</b> <b>with</b> diverse results have been neglected. We show that hypothesized effect indeed occurs in the above examined collections. As a consequence, the research community would benefit from reconsidering existing approaches in the light of diversity...|$|R
5|$|Dworkin and MacKinnon, however, {{continued}} to discuss civil rights litigation {{as a possible}} approach to combating pornography. In the fall of 1983, MacKinnon secured a one-semester appointment for Dworkin at the University of Minnesota, to teach a course in literature for the Women's Studies program and co-teach (with MacKinnon) an interdepartmental course on pornography, where they hashed out details of a civil rights <b>approach.</b> <b>With</b> encouragement from community activists in south Minneapolis, the Minneapolis city government hired Dworkin and MacKinnon to draft an antipornography civil rights ordinance as {{an amendment to the}} Minneapolis city civil rights ordinance.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like the}} player's pilot, {{most of the}} other {{characters}} are low-key. The non-player character Admiral Aken Bosch, however, plays a crucial part in moving the story. As a prominent antagonist from the start, he sparks off a rebellion which escalates the scale of action, and brings in the other antagonist force, the Shivans, into the story. The storytelling took on a character-driven <b>approach</b> <b>with</b> expositions taking the form of cutscenes in which Bosch gives out monologues, revealing the purpose and driving forces behind his actions. A few established voice actors were brought in to give a polished touch to the voices in the game. Academy Award nominee Robert Loggia voiced the player's commanding officer, Admiral Petrarch, and Admiral Bosch was voiced by Ronny Cox. Kurtwood Smith and Stephen Baldwin participated in bit roles as well.|$|E
5|$|On 7 October 1964, Vulcan B.2 XM601 crashed during {{overshoot}} from an asymmetric power practice approach at Coningsby. The copilot had executed the asymmetric power <b>approach</b> <b>with</b> two engines producing thrust and two at idle. He {{was being}} checked by the Squadron Commander, who was {{unfamiliar with the}} aircraft. When he commenced the overshoot the copilot moved all the throttles to full power. The engines that had been producing power reached full power more quickly than the engines at idle and the resultant asymmetric thrust exceeded the available rudder authority, causing the aircraft to spin and crash. All the crew perished.|$|E
40|$|Leading {{scholars}} in discourse analysis and European foreign policy join force in this book, marking a real {{breakthrough in the}} literature. Not only do they offer original perspectives on European foreign policy, but they bring together various theories on foreign policy discourses that remain too often isolated from each other. This theoretical diversity is clearly reflected in the book’s four-pronged structure: Part I - Post-structuralist <b>Approaches</b> (<b>with</b> contributions from Thomas Diez, Henrik Larsen and Beste Isleyne). Part II - Constructivist <b>Approaches</b> (<b>with</b> contributions from Knud Erik Jørgensen, Jan Orbie, Ferdi de Ville, Esther Barbé, Anna Herranz-Surrallés and Michal Natorski) Part III - Critical Discourse Analytical <b>Approaches</b> (<b>with</b> contributions from Senem Aydin-Düzgit, Amelie Kutter, Ruth Wodak, Salomi Boukala, and Caterina Carta.

5|$|The riots {{caused a}} major change in the government's {{approach}} to racial issues, and led to the introduction of an aggressive affirmative action policy strongly favouring the Malays, the New Economic Policy (NEP). The National Culture Policy, also introduced in 1970, emphasised an assimilation of the non-Malays into the Malay ethnic group. However, during the 1990s Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad rejected this <b>approach,</b> <b>with</b> his Bangsa Malaysia policy emphasising a Malaysian instead of Malay identity for the state. During the 2000s decade politicians began stressing ketuanan Melayu again, and publicly chastised government ministers who questioned the social contract.|$|E
5|$|Tătărescu later contrasted his {{diplomatic}} <b>approach</b> <b>with</b> {{the strategy}} of Barbu Știrbey (who had only attempted {{an agreement with the}} Western Allies in Cairo, instead of opening relations with the Soviets). Initially meeting with the refusal of Iuliu Maniu and Dinu Brătianu (who decided to invest their trust in Știrbey), he was relatively successful after the Cairo initiative proved fruitless: the two traditional parties accepted collaboration with the bloc formed by the PCR, the Romanian Social Democratic Party, the Ploughmen's Front, and the Socialist Peasants' Party, leading to the formation of the short-lived and unstable National Democratic Bloc (BND) in June 1944. It overthrew Antonescu in August, by means of the successful King Michael Coup.|$|E
5|$|With Thalapathi, Mani {{ended his}} {{long-term}} association with music director Ilaiyaraaja, bringing in debutant music director A. R. Rahman to score his Tamil classic Roja (1992). The venture was successful, earning Mani various awards. Roja, a romantic film, was about {{terrorism in the}} Kashmir region. Starring Arvind Swamy and Madhoo, it was nominated for the Golden St. George Award at the 18th Moscow International Film Festival. It became highly popular, gaining an iconic status in Indian cinema and was dubbed into other languages and met similar success in other regions. Mani took a more light-hearted <b>approach</b> <b>with</b> his next film—Thiruda Thiruda (1993). Scripted by Ram Gopal Varma, the film was a fun filled caper, which was a departure from Mani's previous style and fared moderately well at the box office. Thiruda Thiruda was premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 1994.|$|E
