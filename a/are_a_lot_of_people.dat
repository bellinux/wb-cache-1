[...] Many reviewers agreed with this sentiment, commenting on the {{transition}} from a [...] "spoiled brat" [...] to a young, confused, but courageous teenager were noted by several reviewers positively.

500|$|Bushnell {{felt that}} Pong was {{especially}} significant in {{its role as}} a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: [...] "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play Pong and there's nobody to play.' It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ...
