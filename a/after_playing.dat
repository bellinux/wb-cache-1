40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was made to}} evaluate the influences {{of the use of}} visual display terminal (VDT) on eye function and mental activities. The subjects, ten female university students, were asked to play a TV-game for 80 min. Immediately before and <b>after</b> <b>play,</b> measurements were made on near point of eye accommodation and flicker values, together with a survey on subjective fatigue symptoms. The measurements and survey were repeated at 30 and 60 min <b>after</b> cessation of <b>play</b> to examine the recovery process. During and <b>after</b> <b>play,</b> frequency of blinking in each subject was also counted as a sign of fatigue. For comparison, the experiments were made at the two different settings of view-distance, 0. 5 m and 1. 5 m, between the eyes of subjects and the screen of VDT. 1. Near point of accommodation did not change significantly <b>after</b> <b>play</b> at view-distance of 0. 5 m because of a large variability among the subjects, but prolonged immediately <b>after</b> <b>play</b> at view-distance of 1. 5 m and recovered after 30 min rest. 2.

Many subjects complained of subjective fatigue symptoms in their eyes <b>after</b> <b>play.</b> The number of complaints was larger and the recovery time from fatigue was longer when view-distance was shorter. 4. Frequency of blinking increased continuously with time <b>after</b> start of <b>play.</b> The degree of increase was greater at shorter view-distance, indicating greater loads on eye functions...|$|R
