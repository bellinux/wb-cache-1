500|$|VanDerWerff {{said that}} Morrison had [...] "a nice {{moment when he}} underplays the scene where he talks about how Will once {{contemplated}} suicide after getting caught cheating on a test", though while Lynch thought the [...] "idea of the scene was nice", it was [...] "more awkward than meaningful". Slezak called it [...] "the worst moment of the episode", and criticized the [...] "utter lack of context" [...] regarding what else Will might have been going through. Kubicek described it as an [...] "embarrassingly uncomfortable speech", and Will's implicit comparison of cheating on a test to the stresses of teenage homosexuality was [...] "just wrong". VanDerWerff thought that the next part of the sequence had [...] "a smallness, a realness to the scene that's kind of beautiful, really", and that it feels [...] "like they're actual high school kids"; Votta commented that [...] "as the kids admit <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> are looking forward to", it reminds viewers why they are [...] "rooting for this ragtag bunch".|$|E

They talked of the places they must go to, of their home and of the beautiful things with which they would fill it. Margaret's animation was extraordinary. Arthur was amused at her delight with the brightness of the place, with the good things they ate, and with the wine. Her laughter was like a rippling brook. Everything tended to take him out of his usual reserve. Life was very pleasing, at that moment, and he felt singularly joyful.|$|E
60|$|Once {{again he}} read the letter, which seemed now {{impregnated}} with fresh meaning, and the anger which had mingled with his first sensation of relief detached itself and grew in force. In that letter there was something tyrannous, a denial of his {{right to have a}} separate point of view. It was like a finger pointed at him as an unsound person. In marrying her he would be marrying not only her, but her class--his class. She would be there always to make him look on her and on himself, and all the people that they knew and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> did, complacently; she would be there to make him feel himself superior to everyone whose life was cast in other moral moulds. To feel himself superior, not blatantly, not consciously, but with subconscious righteousness.|$|E
6000|$|... "'In {{the reign}} of the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid, there was at Bagdad a druggist, called Alboussan Ebn Thaher, a very rich, {{handsome}} man. He had more wit and politeness than people of his profession ordinarily have. His integrity, sincerity, and jovial humour made him beloved and sought after by all sorts of people. The Caliph, who knew his merit, had entire confidence in him. He had so great an esteem for him that he entrusted him with the care to provide his favourite ladies with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> stood in need of. He chose for them their clothes, furniture, and jewels, with admirable taste. His good qualities and the favour of the Caliph made the sons of Emirs and other officers of the first rank be always about him. His house was the rendezvous of all the nobility of the Court.' ...|$|E

60|$|They {{were sitting}} {{in a sort of}} litter on the hillside; <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> had hurriedly collected, in various places, for their flight, were strewn indiscriminately round them. The two swords with which they had lately sought each other's lives were flung down on the grass at random, like two idle walking-sticks. Some {{provisions}} they had bought last night, at a low public house, in case of undefined contingencies, were tossed about like the materials of an ordinary picnic, here a basket of chocolate, and there a bottle of wine. And to add to the disorder finally, there were strewn on top of everything, the most disorderly of modern things, newspapers, and more newspapers, and yet again newspapers, the ministers of the modern anarchy. Turnbull picked up one of them drearily, and took out a pipe.|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Callaway {{translates}} some Zulu communications which {{indicate the}} amount of belief in this very practical and sceptical people. Amusing illustrations of their scepticism will be quoted later, under 'Possession,' but they do accept as seers certain hysterical patients. These are tested by their skill in finding objects which have been hidden without their knowledge. They then behave much like Mr. Stuart Cumberland, but have not the advantage of muscular contact with the person who knows where the hidden objects are concealed. The neighbours even deny that they have hidden anything at all. 'When they persist in their denial ... he finds {{all the things that}} they have hidden. They see that he is a great inyanga (seer) when he has found <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> have concealed.' No doubt he is guided, perhaps in a super-sensitive condition, by the unconscious indications of the excited spectators.|$|E

5000|$|Hellenic Christians {{and their}} medieval successors then applied this Form-based {{philosophy}} to the Christian God. Philosophers took <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that <b>they</b> considered good, Power, Love, Knowledge and Size, and posited that God was [...] "infinite" [...] {{in all these}} respects. They then concluded that God was omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent and omnibenevolent. Since God was perfect, any change would make him less than perfect, so they asserted that God was unchanging, or immutable.|$|R

And losing our heads, and rushing off in crowds to where there wasn't any more safety than where we were. They don't want to bother us yet. They're making their things--making <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> couldn't bring with them, getting things ready {{for the rest of}} their people. Very likely that's why the cylinders have stopped for a bit, for fear of hitting those who are here. And instead of our rushing about blind, on the howl, or getting dynamite on the chance of busting them up, we've got to fix ourselves up according to the new state of affairs. That's how I figure it out. It isn't quite according to what a man wants for his species, but it's about what the facts point to. And that's the principle I acted upon. Cities, nations, civilisation, progress--it's all over. That game's up. We're beat." ...|$|E
6000|$|Surely {{everyone}} must love Randall. It {{had never occurred}} to Janet to ask herself, as Avery had asked, if she would like to marry Randall. Randall could never fancy her--a little plain, brown thing, only half grown. Nobody could think of her beside beautiful, rose-faced Avery. Janet accepted this fact unquestioningly. She had never been jealous. She only felt that she wanted Randall to have everything he wanted--to be perfectly happy. Why, it would be dreadful if he did not marry Avery--if he went and married some other girl. She would never see him then, never have any more delightful talks with him about <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> both loved so much--winds and delicate dawns, mysterious woods in moonlight and starry midnights, silver-white sails going out of the harbour in the magic of morning, and the grey of gulf storms. There would be nothing in life; it would just be one great, unbearable emptiness; for she, herself, would never marry. There was nobody for her to marry--and she didn't care. If she could have Randall for a real brother, she would not mind a bit being an old maid. And there was that beautiful new frame house Randall had built for his bride, which she, Janet, had helped him build, because Avery would not condescend to details of pantry and linen closet and cupboards. Janet and Randall had had such fun over the cupboards. No stranger must ever come to be mistress of that house. Randall must marry Avery, and she must love him. Could anything be done to make her love him? ...|$|E
60|$|Among {{the words}} which have {{undergone}} so many successive transitions of meaning that every {{trace of a}} property common to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> are applied to, or at least common and also peculiar to those things, has been lost, Stewart considers the word Beautiful to be one. And (without attempting to decide a question which in no respect belongs to logic) I can not but feel, with him, considerable doubt whether the word beautiful connotes the same property when we speak of a beautiful color, a beautiful face, a beautiful scene, a beautiful character, and a beautiful poem. The word was doubtless extended from one of these objects to another on account of a resemblance between them, or, more probably, between the emotions they excited; and, by this progressive extension, it has at last reached things very remote from those objects of sight to {{which there is no}} doubt that it was first appropriated; and it is at least questionable whether there is now any property common to all the things which, consistently with usage, may be called beautiful, except the property of agreeableness, which the term certainly does connote, but which can not be all that people usually intend to express by it, since there are many agreeable things which are never called beautiful. If such be the case, it is impossible to give to the word Beautiful any fixed connotation, such that it shall denote all the objects which in common use it now denotes, but no others. A fixed connotation, however, it ought to have; for, so long as it has not, it is unfit to be used as a scientific term, and is a perpetual source of false analogies and erroneous generalizations.|$|E
