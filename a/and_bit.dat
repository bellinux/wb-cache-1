5|$|The Cretaceous period saw the {{appearance}} of more plant defense mechanisms. The diversification of flowering plants (angiosperms) at that time {{is associated with the}} sudden burst of speciation in insects. This diversification of insects represented a major selective force in plant evolution, and led to selection of plants that had defensive adaptations. Early insect herbivores were mandibulate <b>and</b> <b>bit</b> or chewed vegetation; but the evolution of vascular plants lead to the co-evolution of other forms of herbivory, such as sap-sucking, leaf mining, gall forming and nectar-feeding.|$|E
5|$|The factory {{was located}} on the rocky banks of the Poesten Kill, a creek that was {{commonly}} used for water power in the area. Allen had two new buildings erected and funneled creek water to them through tunnels in the bedrock underneath the buildings. He named his enterprise the Millville Manufacturing Company and converted the mill into an auger <b>and</b> <b>bit</b> factory. At one point, he experimented with producing cable chains and files, as well. But the company soon ran into legal difficulties and was dissolved.|$|E
5|$|To {{defy the}} prophecies, Oleg sent the horse away. Many {{years later he}} asked where his horse was, and was told it had died. He asked to see the remains and {{was taken to the}} place where the bones lay. When he touched the horse's skull with his boot a snake slithered from the skull <b>and</b> <b>bit</b> him. Oleg died, thus {{fulfilling}} the prophecy.|$|E

5|$|Jared {{tells the}} police that he was with Ricko; {{when he tries to}} suggest Tracy's death may have been an accident, the police show him the photos of Tracy's {{battered}} body. Jared aggressively confronts Ricko at the beach and Ricko confesses that Tracy's death was not an accident. He had found her walking on the beach after the rape and she asked him to take her home. He agreed, but wanted to have sex with her first. She tried to fight him off <b>and</b> <b>bit</b> him in the process, which enraged him enough to beat her to death.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 1920, Alexander {{was injured}} while {{walking through the}} grounds of the Tatoi estate. A {{domestic}} Barbary macaque belonging to the steward of the palace's grapevines attacked or was attacked by the king's German Shepherd Dog, Fritz, and Alexander attempted to separate the two animals. As he did so, another monkey attacked Alexander <b>and</b> <b>bit</b> him deeply on the leg and torso. Eventually servants arrived and chased away the monkeys, and the king's wounds were promptly cleaned and dressed but not cauterized. He did not consider the incident serious and asked that it not be publicized.|$|E
5|$|There exist data {{structures}} that may improve on binary search {{in some cases}} for both searching and other operations available for sorted arrays. For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more efficiently than binary search on specialized data structures such as van Emde Boas trees, fusion trees, tries, <b>and</b> <b>bit</b> arrays. However, while these operations can always be done at least efficiently on a sorted array regardless of the keys, such data structures are usually only faster because they exploit the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus will be time or space consuming for keys that lack that attribute. Some structures, such as Judy arrays, {{use a combination of}} approaches to mitigate this while retaining efficiency and the ability to perform approximate matching.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{additional}} transistors, {{the reduction in}} ground wires <b>and</b> <b>bit</b> lines allows a denser layout and greater storage capacity per chip. (The ground wires <b>and</b> <b>bit</b> lines are actually much wider than the lines in the diagrams.) In addition, NANDflash is typically permitted to contain {{a certain number of}} faults (NORflash, as is used for a BIOSROM, is expected to be fault-free). Manufacturers try to maximize the amount of usable storage by shrinking the size of the transistors.|$|E

25|$|Sam rescued Frodo from {{a band of}} orcs at the Tower of Cirith Ungol.

At that moment, however, Gollum attacked him <b>and</b> <b>bit</b> off his finger, taking back the Ring. Gollum {{was too close to}} the edge: as he gloated over his prize he fell into the fires of Mount Doom, taking the Ring with him, thus destroying it and Sauron's power.|$|E
25|$|Compared to NOR flash, {{replacing}} single transistors with serial-linked groups adds {{an extra}} level of addressing. Whereas NORflash might address memory by page then word, NANDflash might address it by page, word <b>and</b> <b>bit.</b> Bit-level addressing suits bit-serial applications (such as hard disk emulation), which access only one bit at a time. Execute-in-place applications, {{on the other}} hand, require every bit in a word to be accessed simultaneously. This requires word-level addressing. In any case, both bit and word addressing modes are possible with either NOR or NANDflash.|$|E

Also, the various 8-inch formats supported by 86-DOS and MS-DOS do not fit this scheme.|$|E

25|$|The eighth {{match was}} between The Giant and Diamond Dallas Page. The Giant {{dominated}} Page after sending {{him into the}} ringsteps and ringposts. After delivering several attacks, The Giant applied the bear hug. Page fought out, <b>and</b> <b>bit</b> The Giant's forehead, but The Giant performed a chokeslam backbreaker. Page performed a tornado DDT, and both were down. Bret Hart came out, and accidentally hit The Giant with a steel chair. Page performed flying clotheslines until The Giant caught him, and attempted a chokeslam from the top turnbuckle. Page countered it into a Diamond Cutter, and pinned The Giant to win the match.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, {{after signing}} his first solo career record deal, Osbourne bit the {{head off a}} dove during a meeting with CBS Records {{executives}} in Los Angeles. Apparently {{he had planned to}} release doves into the air as a sign of peace, but due to being intoxicated at the time, he instead grabbed a dove <b>and</b> <b>bit</b> its head off. He then spat the head out, with blood still dripping from his lips. Despite its controversy, the head-biting act has been parodied and alluded to several times throughout his career and is part of what made Osbourne famous.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to implement new high-power slim-hole motors <b>and</b> <b>bits</b> into field gas well drilling applications. Development of improved motors <b>and</b> <b>bits</b> is critical because rotating time constitutes the major cost of drilling gas wells. Conventional motors drill most formations 2 to 3 times faster than rotary continuous coring systems due to greater power transfer to the drill bit. New high-power motors <b>and</b> large-cutter TSP <b>bits</b> being developed by Maurer Engineering, Inc. (MEI) drill 2 to 3 times faster than conventional motors. These slim-hole high-power motors <b>and</b> <b>bits,</b> which are ready for field testing on this DOE project, should reduce drilling costs by 20 to 40 percent in many areas. The {{objective of}} Phase I is to design, manufacture and laboratory test improved high-power slim-hole motors <b>and</b> large-cutter TSP <b>bits.</b> This work will be done in preparation for Phase II field tests. The objective of Phase II will be to field test the high-power motors <b>and</b> <b>bits</b> in Amoco`s Catoosa shallow-test well near Tulsa, OK, and in deep gas wells. The goal will be to drill 2 to 3 times faster than conventional motors and to reduce the drilling costs by 20 to 40 percent over the intervals drilled...|$|R
