5|$|Believing {{that men}} {{should not be}} given {{the right to vote}} without women also being granted the franchise, Sojourner Truth, a former slave and feminist, {{affiliated}} herself with Stanton and Anthony's organization. Stanton, Anthony, <b>and</b> <b>Truth</b> were joined by Matilda Joslyn Gage, who later worked on The Woman's Bible with Stanton. Despite Stanton's position and the efforts of her and others to expand the Fifteenth Amendment to include voting rights for all women, this amendment also passed, as it was originally written, in 1870.|$|E
5000|$|Both facts <b>and</b> <b>truths</b> are {{normally}} established prior to argument; these are aspects of reality {{that would be}} agreed to, for instance, by the universal audience as conceived by the orator. Neither facts nor truths provide opportunity for dispute; as Perelman explains, [...] "if we presuppose the coherence of reality <b>and</b> of our <b>truths</b> taken as a whole, there cannot be any conflict between facts <b>and</b> <b>truths</b> on which we would be called to make a decision" [...] (2001, p. 1394). Presumptions, like facts <b>and</b> <b>truths,</b> need not be defended. Should the argument require opposing presumptions, however, the orator may overturn previous opinion by proving an opposite case.|$|R

5|$|Gandhi first {{proposed}} a flag to the Indian National Congress in 1921. The flag {{was designed by}} Pingali Venkayya. In the centre was a traditional spinning wheel, symbolising Gandhi's goal of making Indians self-reliant by fabricating their own clothing. The design was then modified to include a white stripe in the centre for other religious communities, and provide a background for the spinning wheel. Subsequently, to avoid sectarian associations with the colour scheme, saffron, white and green were chosen for the three bands, representing courage and sacrifice, peace <b>and</b> <b>truth,</b> and faith and chivalry respectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{night after}} SummerSlam, Punk accused Nash of conspiring with Triple H to keep Punk {{away from the}} WWE Championship. After {{repeated}} confrontations, Nash and Punk demanded to face each other at Night of Champions, to which Triple H acquiesced. However, after Punk's repeated verbal attacks towards {{him and his wife}} Stephanie McMahon, Triple H booked himself to replace Nash. At Night of Champions, Punk lost a No Disqualification match after Nash, The Miz, and R-Truth attacked both men. Miz <b>and</b> <b>Truth</b> also attacked Punk at Hell in a Cell after he lost a WWE Championship triple threat match. He attempted to avenge this by teaming with Triple H against Miz <b>and</b> <b>Truth</b> at Vengeance, but lost again due to Nash attacking Triple H. This helped transition Punk's anti-establishment voice from Triple H to John Laurinaitis, who became the interim Raw general manager. Punk balked at Laurinaitis' promotion and verbally attacked him as a dull yes man.|$|E

5|$|The Shaiva Puranas, {{particularly}} the Shiva Purana and the Linga Purana, present the {{various aspects of}} Shiva, mythologies, cosmology and pilgrimage (Tirtha) associated with him. The Shiva-related Tantra literature, composed between the 8th and 11th centuries, are regarded in devotional dualistic Shaivism as Sruti. Dualistic Shaiva Agamas which consider soul within each living being and Shiva as two separate realities (dualism, dvaita), are the foundational texts for Shaiva Siddhanta. Other Shaiva Agamas teach that these are one reality (monism, advaita), and that Shiva is the soul, the perfection <b>and</b> <b>truth</b> within each living being. In Shiva related sub-traditions, there are ten dualistic Agama texts, eighteen qualified monism-cum-dualism Agama texts and sixty four monism Agama texts.|$|E
5|$|The various {{speakers}} represent different {{facets of}} Holmes's life and experiences. The {{speaker of the}} first installment, for example, is understood {{to be a doctor}} who spent several years studying in Paris, while the second volume—The Professor at the Breakfast-Table—is told {{from the point of view}} of a professor of a distinguished medical school. Although the speakers discuss myriad topics, the flow of conversation always leads to supporting Holmes's Paris-taught conception of science and medicine and how they relate to morality and the mind. Autocrat in particular addresses philosophical issues such as the nature of one's self, language, life <b>and</b> <b>truth.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{speaking}} of {{language as a}} general concept, definitions can be used which stress {{different aspects of the}} phenomenon. These definitions also entail different approaches and understandings of language, and they also inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory. Debates about the nature and origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as Gorgias and Plato debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication <b>and</b> <b>truth</b> were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.|$|E

5|$|The balcony is {{topped by}} a niche {{consisting}} of allegorical figures of Justice <b>and</b> <b>Truth,</b> as well as triumphal sculptures of a winged female figure and a putto. Some parts of the sculptures, such as the scales held by Lady Justice, are now missing. The empty spaces between these figures contained Pinto's bust and coat of arms, but they were removed during the French occupation of Malta or in the early 19th century. It is not known how the bust of Pinto looked like, however {{it may have been}} either sculpted similar to the bust on the façade of Auberge de Castille or an original work. In either case it was probably made of bronze, and stood on a marble plinth which is still there. Similar to other busts of the time, {{it may have been the}} work of Jacques Saly. The triumphal figures are similar to those found on the 17th century funerary monument of Nicolas Cotoner sculpted by Domenico Guidi, but it is unknown who worked on the replica of the Castellania.|$|E
5|$|The twin pylons rise to {{a height}} 30metres above the memorial's stone platform; one bears the maple leaf for Canada and the other the fleur-de-lis for France, and both symbolize the unity and {{sacrifice}} of the two countries. At {{the top of the}} pylons is a grouping of figures known collectively as the Chorus. The most senior figures represent Justice and Peace; Peace stands with a torch upraised, making it the highest point in the region. The pair is in a style similar to Allward's previously commissioned statues of Truth and Justice, located outside the Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa. The remainder of the Chorus is located directly below the senior figures: Faith, Hope <b>and</b> <b>Truth</b> on the eastern pylon; and Honour, Charity and Knowledge on the western pylon. Around these figures are shields of Canada, Britain, and France. Large crosses adorn the outside of each pylon. The First World War battle honours of the Canadian regiments, and a dedicatory message to Canada's war dead in both French and English are located {{at the base of the}} pylons. The Spirit of Sacrifice is located at the base between the two pylons. In the display, a young dying soldier is gazing upward in a crucifixion-like pose, having thrown his torch to a comrade who holds it aloft behind him. In a lightly veiled reference to the poem In Flanders Fields by John McCrae, the torch is passed from one comrade to another in an effort to keep alive the memory of the war dead.|$|E
