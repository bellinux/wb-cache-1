To determine the azimuth angle encoder errors and verify their values {{stored in the}} tracker’s internal error map, several methodologies were evaluated, differing in complexity, measurement time {{and the need for}} specialised measuring equipment. These methodologies are: an artefact-based technique developed by NIST; a multi-target network technique developed by NPL; and the classical precision <b>angular</b> <b>indexing</b> table technique. It is shown that the three methodologies agree within their respective measurement uncertainties and that the NPL technique has the advantages of a short measurement time and no reliance on specialised measurement equipment or artefacts. ...|$|E

SelfA (Self-calibratable Angle device) {{rotary encoder}} can detect {{some kinds of}} angle error, not only its encoder scale error, but also the encoder {{attachment}} error (e. g. eccentricity error). When rotary table with built-in SelfA encoder rotates only one revolution, inner SelfA rotary encoder can calibrate the own angle error with a high accuracy. However, {{in the case of}} the SelfA using the encoder of 36, 000 graduation scales, since the angular interval of the calibrated main scales corresponds to 36 ", it is insufficient for high resolution <b>angular</b> <b>indexing</b> control with high accuracy.

40|$|Polygons {{are basic}} angle {{standards}} for angle measurement, particularly used for calibration of rotary <b>angular</b> <b>indexing,</b> and for measuring {{equipment such as}} dividing heads and tables. A main application in daily life is in bar-code readers. Calibration of such angle standards is required for traceability and at the highest accuracy it is a responsibility of national metrology institutes. In order to investigate uncertainty parameters on polygon calibration and to establish the capabilities of national metrology institutes, intercomparision measurements {{in the name of}} EUROMET project 371 2 ̆ 2 angle calibration on precision polygons 2 ̆ 2 between 12 European countries have been carried out. Two precise polygons with 7 and 24 faces have been calibrated by the participants. Difficulties arose for precise calibration of seven-sided polygon for those institutes, which do not have a high- resolution angle comparator or two autocollimators. UME, the National Metrology Institute of Turkey, has applied an alternative technique for precise calibration of seven-sided polygon without using high-resolution angle comparators (i. e., indexing tables or angle dividers) or two autocollimators. The technique is based on the circle closure principle. The pitch and cumulative angles of the polygon are extracted from the angle measurement between some polygon faces (such as one and four (1 / 4), analogous 2 / 5, 3 / 6, 4 / 7, 5 / 1, 6 / 2 and 7 / 3) the angle of which can be generated close enough by the indexing table. This means that the polygon can be regarded as unfolded in seven 3 -pitch angle intervals of 3 x 360 degrees/ 7; 154 degrees 17 ', making up 1080 degrees in total. The method gives the differences between these seven intervals; with the closure condition (the sum must be zero) this gives all absolute angles. A full uncertainty evaluation is given that is based on the model function which relates the measured values to the polygon angles. For the calibration actually carried out, this yielded an uncertainty of 0. 242 ̆ 2. Within this uncertainty the measured polygon angles corresponded very well with the reference values of the intercomparison. The method is of use for laboratories which do not have a high-resolution angle comparator (i. e., an indexing table or angle divider) or two autocollimators for the calibration of such angle standards.

For this purpose, we calculated the frequencies of the fundamental torsional oscillations with various <b>angular</b> <b>indices</b> ℓ, by changing the stellar mass and radius.

Significant theoretical advances have recently been made in finding efficient polygon triangulation algorithms. However, there is substantial effort being made in finding a simple and practical triangulation algorithm. We propose the concept of pseudo-triangulation (a generalized version of triangulation in which the member triangles need not all have the same orientation), and explore some of its combinatorial and topological properties. Some of the main results of this paper are: (1) We prove the triangulation-flip-graph of a simple polygon is connected. Using this theorem we obtain a very simple linear-time algorithm to recognize whether a given triangulation of a simple polygon is its unique triangulation. (2) We prove the maximum diameter of the triangulation-flip-graph is Θ(n 2). (3) We prove the Spin-Number Theorem on simple polygons; an interesting topological result. (4) We propose a triangulation heuristic that uses the <b>angular</b> (deficit) <b>indices,</b> and the chord-flip operation, in a local search to transform an initial pseudo-triangulation (which is easy to construct) into a triangulation.

This power-law is entirely due to the presence of the black hole. The D= 4 case is special and exhibits, as is well known, the t^[-(2 l+ 3) ] behavior.

Higher multipoles carry a larger fraction of the total energy as q increases. We introduce and compare three different definitions for the ringdown starting time. Applying linear estimation methods (the so-called Prony methods) to the ringdown phase, we find resolution-dependent time variations in the fitted parameters of the final black hole.

The TDRK is the inverse Laplace transform of a frequency-domain radiation kernel (FDRK) which is essentially the logarithmic derivative of the asymptotically outgoing solution to the radial ODE. We numerically implement the ROBC via a rapid algorithm involving approximation of the FDRK by a rational function. Such an approximation is tailored to have relative error ϵ uniformly along the axis of imaginary Laplace frequency. Theoretically, ϵ is also a long-time bound on the relative convolution error. Via study of one-dimensional radial evolutions, we demonstrate that the ROBC capture the phenomena of quasinormal ringing and decay tails. Moreover, carrying out a numerical experiment in which a wave packet strikes the boundary at an angle, we find that the ROBC yield accurate results in a three-dimensional setting. Our work is a partial generalization to Schwarzschild wave propagation and Heun functions of the methods developed for flatspace wave propagation and Bessel functions by Alpert, Greengard, and Hagstrom.
