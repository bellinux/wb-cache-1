2500|$|The statue {{is made of}} {{a bronze}} cast {{depicting}} Lincoln and his son Tad on a bench with Lincoln's <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> son.

The words [...] "To Bind Up The Nation's Wounds" [...] from Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address are carved into granite behind them.|$|E
2500|$|Boxing at {{that time}} was very {{different}} from the boxing of today. [...] There were few rules. [...] There was no boxing organization to oversee the sport or lay down regulations or procedures. [...] There was no formal end to the fights: [...] they would go on until one fighter was unable to continue or would give up. [...] A now obsolete practice was that of the seconds. The seconds would wait in the ring during the fight, and assist the boxer between rounds. [...] There were no restrictions regarding fight tactics. [...] For example, a fighter could hit his opponent's head off a corner post, or wrestle his opponent to the ground, or pull his hair, or wrap his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck in a choking motion and then hit him in the face with the other hand. [...] The fights were very severe and often brutal, and they would continue until the end.|$|E

60|$|The landlady {{left the}} room silently. The girl came over to her uncle and threw her <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck.|$|E
60|$|Moses {{bent down}} and kissed her, and felt her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck.|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth {{suddenly}} {{threw her}} <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck {{and held her}} cheek to his.|$|R
5000|$|Cause {{she wants}} to put her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck, and {{look in his eyes}} so blue ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This way," [...] roared Councill, {{putting his}} <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> wife's waist. She boxed his ears, while he guffawed and clucked at his team.|$|E
6000|$|The girl {{beside him}} put her <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck {{and tried to}} hush him, and through the mufflement of her embrace they could hear him gurgling: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Home now. Hasten; we will {{be there}} before any one will know it," [...] she said, as she threw one <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> waist, with superb unconsciousness.|$|E
60|$|As he finished, she {{suddenly}} threw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck, burst into tears, and sobbed convulsively.|$|R

60|$|The speaker stopped, {{not because}} {{he had come to}} the end of his remarks, but because one of the seamen had passed his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck and was choking him.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's {{the matter}} with you, chump? Can't you see where you're goin'?" [...] he cried, angrily, and the {{tightening}} of the little maid's <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck told that she was frightened.|$|E
6000|$|... "And you {{are little}} Walter," [...] {{returned}} the cavalier, instantly dismounting, and flinging his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> brother; [...] "why, what a fine fellow you are grown! How are {{my mother and}} all?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{threw her}} <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck. He made no response, {{nor did he}} thrust her away. He {{remained}} quite passive.|$|R

60|$|The Colonel {{passed his}} <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> daughter, {{and pulled his}} goatee thoughtfully. And Virginia, glancing shyly upward, saw a smile in the creases about his mouth: She smiled, too, and then the tears hid him from her.|$|E
60|$|The full voice quavered and broke. It {{would indeed}} {{have been a}} {{hardened}} youth who could not have felt something of the deep and unutterable affection in the old man. Jack Belllounds put an <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> father's shoulder.|$|E
60|$|She squealed with delight, and, manifestly {{surrendering}} to a long-considered temptation, {{she threw her}} <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck and hugged him close.|$|R
60|$|She {{threw her}} <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck, and he rested his head upon her shoulder. It {{was like an}} elixir of life for him.|$|R
60|$|Whereupon Betty ran to him, flung her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> {{neck and}} clung to him. Isaac kissed her tenderly and {{disengaged}} himself from her arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was a kind}} of {{a manager}} of the place, and I reckon he'd seen me in there a good many times. He had a face like a fish and an eye like Judas, but I got up and put one <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck.|$|E
60|$|Hilda {{motioned to}} him to come close to her. He came, and bent over and kissed her, and she, with an effort, threw one ivory <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck, and smiled sweetly.

6000|$|... "Don't, Pam, don't! I'll {{come back}} all right, and bring you news {{and all the}} pretty things I can. I must go; I feel as if I couldn't breathe, shut up here winters. I s'pose it's wicked, but I can't help it," [...] whispered Eli, with his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> buxom eighteen-year old sister, who laid {{her head on his}} {{shoulder}} and held him tight.|$|E
60|$|Fred {{could not}} arise; but he flung both <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> tormentor's neck, hugging him so close as {{to prevent the}} latter from using his hands.|$|R
60|$|He did not answer. She {{stood up}} and passed one of her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck, {{and with the other}} hand gently {{disengaged}} his fingers from before his face.|$|R
