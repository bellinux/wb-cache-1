50|$|During the 84-day Skylab 4 mission, {{the spine}} {{elongation}} of one astronaut was measured and recorded to the 1/16th inch (Thornton, 1987). This study described an asymptomatic increase in height during flight that plateaued at 29 days. The total height increase was 1.5 inches, {{measured at the}} end of the mission. This elongation is presumed to be due to the expansion of intervertebral discs during weightlessness (<b>axial</b> <b>unloading).</b> The astronaut also reported back pain on landing day that was associated with a herniated intervertebral disc.|$|E
5000|$|Intervertebral disc volume {{changes were}} {{quantified}} by {{magnetic resonance imaging}} in response to varying scenarios of <b>axial</b> <b>unloading.</b> [...] The cross-sectional areas and the transverse proton relaxation constants (T2) of IVDs were indices used to monitor adaptive changes of the intervertebral discs to overnight bed rest (over 5 weeks and 17 weeks) and after 8 days of spaceflight. The averaged expansion of IVDs with bed rest appeared to reach an equilibrium anywhere between 9 hours and 4 days of unloading with the expansion ranging between 10-40% of baseline, pre-bed rest values (mean = 22%). There were mild increases in T2 relaxation times relative to increases in disc area. Restoration of IVD volumes after unloading was not evaluated systematically but Table 1 provides a relative comparison of the elapsed time in 1 G at which time the measured IVD volumes were no different from baseline measurements; the relative periods of recovery appear to lengthen as the period of IVD adaptation to unloading increases.|$|E

To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} study to assess the effect of long-term <b>axial</b> <b>unloading</b> on morphology of healthy vertebras in adults. The objective {{of this study is to}} quantify the effects of long-term relative <b>axial</b> <b>unloading</b> on thoracolumbar vertebral body height in adults. In this study, 218 vertebras on 200 plain lateral radiograms of patients with thoracolumbar vertebral body fracture, which underwent long segment instrumentation and fusion and had a relative <b>axial</b> <b>unloading</b> on five vertebrae of thoracolumbar spine were evaluated. Anterior vertebral body height (AVBH) and posterior vertebral body height (PVBH) proximal and distal to the fractured vertebrae were measured before and at least 1  year after the unloading operative procedures. AVBH of the first distal adjacent vertebrae and summative AVBHs of the first distal and proximal adjacent vertebras to the fractured vertebrae were significantly increased after 1  year of unloading, whereas the PVBH changes were not noticeable and the mean of cumulative height of two levels of proximal and distal adjacent vertebras to the fractured vertebrae did not show significant difference. Vertebral body height of lumbar was more influenced by unloading when compared with thoracic spine. Long-term relative <b>axial</b> <b>unloading</b> can affect the height of healthy vertebral bodies in adult spine...|$|E

Using the iso-diameter headgear, different axial-radial unload ratio tests were done on the GDS triaxial apparatus, and the <b>axial</b> load was <b>unloaded</b> smaller than the radial load.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the correlation between neurogenic intermittent claudication (NIC) in LSS and different positions as well as loading status, using the treadmill device. The study was a prospective clinical trial on lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) using a treadmill equipment. The study population comprised of 80 LSS patients with a mean age of 61. The equipment included a treadmill, unloading station and loading vests. The patients were instructed to walk in five different positions. The initiation time of symptoms and total walking time were recorded. The examination was stopped after 20  min or at the onset of severe symptoms. In order to obtain pretest demographic data on subjects, visual analog scale, Roland–Morris questionnaire, pain disability index, and Beck depression index were used. The initiation time of symptoms (ITS) and total walking time (TWT) were measured during the test. Unloading provided a longer and loading a shorter ITS and TWT. Decline or incline positions did not affect ITS or TWT. The changes in posture had no correlation with the appearance of symptoms in LSS patients with NIC on a treadmill in this study, rather ITS and TWT were determined by <b>axial</b> loading and <b>unloading...</b>|$|R
40|$|Space {{flight is}} known to cause {{alterations}} in multiple physiological systems including changes in sensorimotor, cardiovascular, and neuromuscular systems. These physiological changes cause balance, gait and visual disturbances, cardiovascular deconditioning, and loss of muscle mass and strength. These changes may affect a crewmember's ability to perform critical mission tasks immediately after landing on a planetary surface. To understand how changes in physiological function affect functional performance, an interdisciplinary pre- and postflight testing regimen, Functional Task Test (FTT), was developed to systematically evaluate both astronaut functional performance and related physiological changes. Ultimately this information {{will be used to}} assess performance risks and inform the design of countermeasures for exploration class missions. We are currently conducting the FTT study on International Space Station (ISS) crewmembers before and after 6 -month expeditions. Additionally, in a corresponding study we are using the FTT protocol on subjects before and after 70 days of 6 deg head-down bed-rest as an analog for space flight. Bed-rest provides the opportunity for us to investigate the role of prolonged <b>axial</b> body <b>unloading</b> in isolation from the other physiological effects produced by exposure to the microgravity environment of space flight. Therefore, the bed rest analog allows us to investigate the impact of body unloading on both functional tasks and on the underlying physiological factors that lead to decrement in performance and then compare them with the results obtained in our space flight study. Functional tests included ladder climbing, hatch opening, jump down, manual manipulation of objects and tool use, seat egress and obstacle avoidance, recovery from a fall and object translation tasks. Physiological measures included assessments of postural and gait control, dynamic visual acuity, fine motor control, plasma volume, heart rate, blood pressure, orthostatic intolerance, upper- and lower-body muscle strength, power, endurance, control, and neuromuscular drive. ISS crewmembers were tested three times before flight, and on 1, 6, and 30 days after landing. Bed-rest subjects were tested three times before bed-rest and immediately after getting up from bed-rest as well as 1, 6, and 12 days after reambulation...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{engineering}} practices used in mining the protective coal seam at Huainan coalfield in China, this study investigates the temporal evolution of three-dimensional {{stress of the}} protected coal seam by numerical simulation. The coal body of the protected coal seam should first be loaded and then unloaded with the three-dimensional stress being reduced simultaneously. In accordance with the forcing process around the coal body of the protected coal seam, permeability experiments were performed under fixed <b>axial</b> displacement with <b>unloading</b> confining pressure (FADUCP) and fixed deviatoric stress with unloading confining pressure (FDSUCP) stress paths. During the loading stage before the unloading point, the permeability and axial strain have a negative exponential relationship. However, during the unloading stage after the unloading point, the permeability and axial strain have a positive exponential relationship. Using the relationship between permeability and axial strain, along with the swelling and deformation of the protected coal seam, the permeability distribution characteristics for the protected coal seam was obtained. According to the permeability distribution characteristics of the protected coal seam, drilling designs for gas drainage can be optimized. Finally, the rationality of the drilling design was verified using gas data measured during mining of the protected coal seam...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn most rock {{mechanical}} testing devices, {{the texture}} developed during deformation is only observed after the failure, and the detailed mapping of cracks and pore structure evolution, just {{before or after}} rupture, remains speculative. Computerized X-ray tomography (CT X-ray) offers a way to observe 'in vivo' some characteristics of a tested sample {{in the course of}} its deformation. Therefore we developed an X-ray transparent tri-axial cell that was included in a medical purpose X-ray scanner with a volumetric resolution of the order of 1 mm 3. This technique is described and applied to a porous calcarenite, which is regularly scanned for porosity evolution during mechanical testing. The experiment is performed at low confining pressure (2 - 10 MPa). During testing, an axial load is applied until failure and is then progressively decreased. In these experiments, the peak stress is preceded by phase of diffuse dilatancy. After failure localization, the <b>axial</b> stress is <b>unloaded</b> until the stress reaches isotropy. During this unloading phase, the previous diffuse dilatancy is lost due to an elastic relaxation. Then, the stress is completely relaxed. At this moment the dilatancy increases again and the residual dilatancy is larger than that reached at the peak stress. When observed "post mortem" at microscopic scale, the dilatant structures are comprised of cataclastic deformation bands and cracks in some larger crystals...|$|R

Ultimately this information will be used to assess performance risks and inform the design of countermeasures for exploration class missions. We are currently conducting studies on both ISS crewmembers and on subjects experiencing 70 days of 6 degrees head-down bed-rest as an analog for space flight. Bed-rest provides the opportunity for us to investigate the role of prolonged <b>axial</b> body <b>unloading</b> in isolation from the other physiological effects produced by exposure to the microgravity environment of space flight. This allows us to parse out the contribution of the body unloading component on functional performance. In this on-going study both ISS crewmembers and bed-rest subjects were tested using an interdisciplinary protocol that evaluated functional performance and related physiological changes before and after 6 months in space and 70 days of 6 head-down bed-rest, respectively. Functional tests included ladder climbing, hatch opening, jump down, manual manipulation of objects and tool use, seat egress and obstacle avoidance, recovery from a fall, and object translation tasks. Crewmembers were tested three times before flight, and on 1, 6 and 30 days after landing. Bed-rest subjects were tested three times before bed-rest and immediately after getting up from bed-rest as well as 1, 6 and 12 days after reambulation. A comparison of bed-rest and space flight data showed a significant concordance in performance changes across all functional tests. Tasks requiring a greater demand for dynamic control of postural equilibrium (i. e. fall recovery, seat egress/obstacle avoidance during walking, object translation, jump down) showed the greatest decrement in performance. Functional tests with reduced requirements for postural stability (i. e. hatch opening, ladder climb, manual manipulation of objects and tool use) showed little reduction in performance. Bed-rest results indicate that body support unloading experienced during space flight plays a central role in postflight alteration of functional task performance. These data point to the importance of providing axial body loading as a central component of an inflight training system that will integrate cardiovascular, resistance and sensorimotor adaptability training modalities into a single interdisciplinary countermeasure system...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour of the intervertebral disc highly {{depends on the}} content and transport of interstitial fluid. It is unknown, however, {{to what extent the}} time-dependent behaviour can be attributed to osmosis. Here we investigate the effect of both mechanical and osmotic loading on water content, nucleus pressure and disc height. Eight goat intervertebral discs, immersed in physiological saline, were subjected to a compressive force with a pressure needle inserted in the nucleus. The loading protocol was: 10  N (6  h); 150  N (42  h); 10  N (24  h). Half-way the 150  N-phase (24  h), we eliminated the osmotic gradient by adding 26 % poly-ethylene glycol to the surrounding fluid. For 62 additional discs, we determined the water content of both nucleus and annulus after 6, 24, 48, or 72  h. The compressive load was initially counterbalanced by the hydrostatic pressure in the nucleus. The load forced 4. 3 % of the water out of the nucleus, which reduced nucleus pressure by 44 (± 6) %. Reduction of the osmotic gradient disturbed the equilibrium disc height, and a significant loss of annulus water content was found. Remarkably, pressure and water content of the nucleus pulposus remained unchanged. This shows that annulus water content is important in the response to <b>axial</b> loading. After <b>unloading,</b> {{in the absence of an}} osmotic gradient, there was substantial viscoelastic recovery of 53 (± 11) % of the disc height, without a change in water content. However, for restoration of the nucleus pressure and for full restoration of disc height, restoration of the osmotic gradient was neede...|$|R

We have previously shown that for Shuttle, ISS and bed rest subjects functional tasks requiring a greater demand for dynamic control of postural equilibrium (i. e. fall recovery, seat egress/obstacle avoidance during walking, object translation, jump down) showed the greatest decrement in performance. Functional tests with reduced requirements for postural stability (i. e. hatch opening, ladder climb, manual manipulation of objects and tool use) showed little reduction in performance.

These results indicate that body support unloading experienced during space flight plays a central role in postflight alteration of functional task performance. Given the importance of body-support loading we set out to determine if there is a relationship between the load experienced during inflight treadmill exercise (produced by a harness and bungee system) and postflight functional performance. ISS crewmembers (n= 13) were tested using the FTT protocol before and after 6 months in space. Crewmembers were tested three times before flight, and on 1, 6, and 30 days after landing. To determine how differences in body-support loading experienced during inflight treadmill exercise impacts postflight functional performance, the loading history for each subject during inflight treadmill (T 2) exercise was correlated with postflight measures of performance. Crewmembers who walked on the treadmill with higher pull-down loads had less decrement in postflight postural stability and dynamic locomotor control than those subjects who exercised with lighter loads. These data point to the importance of providing significant body loading during inflight treadmill exercise. This and the addition of specific balance training may further mitigate decrements in critical mission tasks that require dynamic postural stability and mobility. Inflight treadmill exercise provides a multi-disciplinary platform to provide sensorimotor, aerobic and bone mechanical stimuli benefits. Forward work will focus on the development of an inflight training system that will integrate aerobic, resistive and balance training modalities into a single interdisciplinary countermeasure system for exploration class missions...|$|R

These results indicate that body support unloading experienced during space flight plays a central role in postflight alteration of functional task performance. These data also support the concept that space flight may cause central adaptation of converging body-load somatosensory and vestibular input during gravitational transitions [1]. Therefore, we conclude that providing significant body-support loading during inflight treadmill along with balance training is necessary to mitigate decrements in critical mission tasks that require dynamic postural stability and mobility. Data obtained from space flight and bed rest support the notion that in-flight treadmill exercise, in addition to providing aerobic exercise and mechanical stimuli to the bone, also has a number of sensorimotor benefits by providing: 1) A balance challenge during locomotion requiring segmental coordination in response to a downward force. 2) Body-support loading during performance of a full-body active motor task. 3) Oscillatory stimulation of the otoliths and synchronized periodic foot impacts that facilitate the coordination of gait motions and tune the full-body gaze control system. 4) Appropriate sensory input (foot tactile input, muscle and tendon stretch input) to spinal locomotor central pattern generators required for the control of locomotion. Forward work will focus on a follow-up bed rest study that incorporates aerobic and resistance exercise with a treadmill balance and gait training system that can serve as an integrated interdisciplinary countermeasure system for future exploration class missions...|$|R
40|$|Deformation {{parameters}} of concrete are adequately studied under static uploading of samples until fracture. Methods of their determination during unloading (primarily {{due to the}} lack of experimental data) is not presented in the regulatory and scientific literature. That hinders the development of calculating methods of loadings for reinforced concrete structures, which vary according to certain cyclical regularities. The basis for computational models development for unloading are the results of the studies with short-term tests of concrete samples, where the sample is loaded to a predetermined level of compressive stresses, and then it is unloaded. The purpose of the research is to establish an analytical connection between stress and deformation {{parameters of}} concrete on <b>axial</b> loading and <b>unloading</b> branches with compressive stresses. The subject of the study is: axial and transverse deformation coefficient of transverse deformation volume deformations. The treated cycles have different values of maximum stress, including close to the limit values, taking into account the dilation of concrete. Permanent deformations during unloading are determined in increments of stress and strain by radial method. A connection is established between the initial elastic modulus of concrete and the modulus of deformation during unloading. On the basis of experimental data the analytical determination of the quantities depending on the residual strains for partial or complete unloading was offered. It was found out that in case of increasing stress level at the beginning of unloading the share of transverse strain increases and in case of full unloading, volume deformations increase. In case of unloading from the stress level, when dilatation property is manifested, they change the sign to the opposite, which is, become positive.

The popular one is the utilization of water and wind energy. The blowing wind in Indonesia, according to LAPAN, is variably and the average of its velocity is low (0 – 5 m/s). In utilizing this variably energy, there should be needed electrical machine (generator) that appropriate with the characteristics of its driver. Electrical generator has been widely spread in the market (radial flux type), usually {{in the kind of}} high speed induction generator where in this type, it needs gearbox transmission to get high rotation and also needs initial electrical energy (excitation voltage) to make its magnetic field.

As the solution, in this research, there has been designed the permanently magnetic generator with multi pole to replace the existence voltage by magnetic induction type axial flux that easy to manufacture. The axial generator can be driven by wind turbine and water turbine or other sources. Axial generator has two main parts, they are rotor and stator.
