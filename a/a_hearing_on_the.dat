5|$|Ashbrook was {{defeated}} {{for re-election in}} the 1920 elections; at that time congressional terms did not end until March 4 of the following year. He was friendly with the new committee chairman Albert Henry Vestal (Republicanâ€“Indiana), and persuaded him to schedule <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> peace coin proposal for December 14, 1920. Though no bill was put before it, the committee heard from the ANA delegates, discussed the matter, and favored {{the use of the}} silver dollar, which as a large coin had the most room for an artistic design. The committee took no immediate action; in March 1921, after the Harding administration took office, Vestal met with the new Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew W. Mellon, and Mint Director Raymond T. Baker about the matter, finding them supportive so long as the redesign involved no expense.|$|E
5|$|Osbert {{was accused}} of murdering William, {{specifically}} by poisoning him through the communion chalice. A fellow cleric, Symphorian, {{who had been a}} chaplain of the deceased archbishop, brought murder charges against Osbert. Symphorian obtained <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> charges at a royal council presided over by King Stephen of England at Michaelmas in 1154, but Stephen's subsequent death prevented a resolution. Osbert attempted to have the trial switched to an ecclesiastical court and was supported in his efforts by Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury. A trial was finally held in 1156 and Osbert's accuser did not produce any witnesses, but Osbert was unable to prove his innocence, prompting the transfer of the case to a papal court. No record of any judgment exists, but Osbert apparently appeared before two popes, Adrian IV and Alexander III. A further appeal to the papal court was referred to papal judges-delegate between 1175 and 1180.|$|E
5|$|Before the Columbine High School massacre, {{perpetrator}} Dylan Klebold referenced lyrics from Nine Inch Nails songs {{multiple times}} in his journal. Klebold heavily identified with the protagonist of The Downward Spiral {{as a symbol of}} his own depression. On May 4, 1999, <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> marketing and distribution practices of violent content to minors by the television, music, film, and video game industries was conducted before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The committee heard testimony from cultural observers, professors, and mental health professionals, that included conservative William Bennett and the Archbishop of Denver, Reverend Charles J. Chaput. Participants criticized the album, Nine Inch Nails' label-mate Marilyn Manson, and the 1999 film The Matrix for their alleged contribution to the environment that made tragedies like Columbine possible. The committee requested that the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice investigate the entertainment industry's marketing practices to minors.|$|E

5|$|However, the court's {{role was}} to rule on whether {{publication}} was legal, not whether it was wise. In keeping with the usual practice of keeping {{a temporary restraining order}} in effect for as short a time as possible, Warren ordered that hearings be held on a preliminary injunction in one week's time, on March 16. At the request of both parties, this was postponed to March 26 so they would have time to file their briefs and affidavits. The parties were therefore back in court again on March 26 for <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> government's request for a preliminary injunction. Warren decided not to hold an evidentiary hearing at which the opposing teams of experts could be cross examined. He also declined a suggestion by the Federation of American Scientists in its amicus curiae brief that a panel of experts be charged with examining the issue. The case relied on written affidavits and briefs, and the opposing counsels' oral arguments.|$|E
5|$|In May 1951, ABC {{chairman}} Edward Noble and United Paramount Theatres president Leonard Goldenson {{announced a}} proposed merger between their companies. The {{plan was to}} merge ABC and its five television stations with United Paramount Theatres, a company only recently spun off from Paramount Pictures. UPT also owned the network's Chicago station, WBKB; that station {{would have to be}} sold in order for the merged company to stay under the five-station cap. Because the proposed merger involved the sale of a television station, it required the approval of the FCC, which opened <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue that August. The proposed deal was complex, and would affect many parties involved in television broadcasting, including Paramount, DuMont, and CBS (CBS executives wanted to purchase WBKB). During the hearing, Allen DuMont asked the FCC to force Paramount to sell its share of the DuMont Network. He stated that Paramount in effect owned two television networks, the PTN and DuMont; the FCC had similarly forced NBC to sell off one of its two radio networks eight years earlier due to concerns about multi-network ownership. Paramount executives, however, denied ever having operated a television network. Evidence presented against Paramount included network affiliation contracts and advertisements for the Paramount Television Network from 1951. Despite Paramount executives' testimony, advertisements for the Paramount Television Network ran as late as 1952.|$|E
5|$|On 17 July 1995, U.S. Senator William Roth, {{chairman}} of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, authorized a Senate investigation into the incident, primarily in response to complaints from {{family members of the}} shootdown victims that it appeared that the U.S. military was not holding anyone seriously accountable for the shootdown. Also in response to complaints about the DoD's response to the incident, the U.S. House of Representatives' Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel scheduled <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> incident for 3 August 1995 to examine the accident investigation and the judicial actions that followed. In addition, on 24 July the DoD ordered the USAF to reexamine the disciplinary and administrative actions for the personnel involved in the shootdown and for the Joint Chiefs of Staff to review the corrective actions taken against those involved and determine whether further action was necessary. Widnall requested that the new USAF chief of staff, Ronald R. Fogleman begin his own review of accountability for the incident.|$|E

5|$|On December 9, 1993, a United States Senate {{committee}} held <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{subject of}} video game violence. The hearing {{was led by}} senators Joe Lieberman and Herb Kohl and was covered in major newspapers including USA Today, The Washington Post and The New York Times. Throughout the hearing, the committee scrutinized Night Trap along with Midway's Mortal Kombat (1992). Lieberman, who admitted never playing the game, claimed Night Trap featured gratuitous violence and promoted sexual aggression against women. One game over scene considered particularly offensive involved the nightgown-clad character Lisa being captured by Augers attempting to drain her blood. Tom Zito attempted to explain {{the context of the}} nightgown scene in defense of the game, but he claims he was silenced. In the short documentary Dangerous Games (included with PC versions), the producers and some members of the cast explain that the plot of the game was to in fact prevent the trapping and killing of women. In addition, the blood draining device was intended to look very unrealistic to mitigate the violence. Despite scenes in which the girls are grabbed or pulled by enemies, no nudity or extreme acts of violence were ever filmed or incorporated into the game.|$|E

25|$|The D.C. Office of Campaign Finance {{began an}} {{investigation}} into the 2004 Chavous Democratic primary campaign. The Washington Post reported that the Chavous campaign failed to file financial reports for October and November and paid three invoices totaling $9,000 when the campaign did not have funds to cover the checks. A creditor then {{filed a complaint with the}} D.C. police. The Office of Campaign Finance scheduled <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> alleged campaign violations in November 2004, but Chavous did not appear. In an interview with the Post, Chavous blamed a bank error and his campaign treasurer for the problems. Chavous personally gave one creditor a $5,000 cashier's check to cover a radio ad purchase, and his campaign's field coordinator was paid using $2,000 of Chavous' personal funds and $1,000 of the campaign's funds.|$|E
25|$|FATCA was the revenue-raising {{portion of}} the 2010 {{domestic}} jobs stimulus bill, the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment (HIRE) Act, and was enacted as Subtitle A (sections 501 through 541) of Title V of that law. FATCA is controversial because foreign banks {{have been forced to}} comply under threat of a 30% withholding penalty on all their U.S. transactions. The U.S. has yet to comply with FATCA itself, because as of 2017, it has not yet provided the promised reciprocity to its partner countries and it has failed to sign up to the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). FATCA has also been criticised for its impacts on Americans living overseas, and implicated in record-breaking numbers of U.S. citizenship renunciations throughout the 2010s. Bills to repeal FATCA have been introduced in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, citing its unconstitutionality, particularly its breach of 4th amendment rights, as well as its high implementation costs and lack of revenue generation. <b>A</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> unintended consequences of FATCA was held by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on 26 April 2017.|$|E
25|$|On December 30, 1996, Chavous {{was elected}} {{chairman}} of the Council's Committee on Education, Libraries and Recreation. Ward 3 council member Kathy Patterson, a veteran education activist, also fought for the chairmanship. Patterson strongly criticized Chavous' commitment to educational reform, but Council Chairman David A. Clarke awarded the post to Chavous after he publicly declared education reform {{to be the biggest}} issue facing the sity. Patterson, however, won an agreement that stripped jurisdiction over labor issues from Chavous' committee and gave it to the Committee on Government Operations (chaired by Patterson). During his first year in office, the District of Columbia Public Schools undertook an emergency $50 million project to repair leaking and structurally unsound roofs at several public schools. The project was significantly mismanaged, and forced a delay in the opening of the school year. Chavous ordered <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue in September 1997, but a significant number of parents of schoolchildren complained he had not provided enough oversight and acted too late. In March 1997, Chavous sponsored another significant piece of legislation, a resolution disapproving a construction contract for the highly controversial Barney Circle Freeway.|$|E

25|$|Richard Ceballos {{had been}} {{employed}} since 1989 as a {{deputy district attorney}} for the Los Angeles County District Attorneyâ€™s Office, {{which at the time}} was headed by Gil Garcetti. After the defense attorney in a pending criminal case contacted Ceballos about his motion to challenge a critical search warrant based on inaccuracies in the supporting affidavit, Ceballos conducted his own investigation and determined that the affidavit contained serious misrepresentations. Ceballos contacted the deputy sheriff who had sworn out the affidavit but was not satisfied by his explanations. Ceballos then communicated his findings to his supervisors and submitted a memorandum in which he recommended dismissal of the case. A meeting was subsequently held to discuss the affidavit with his superiors and officials from the sheriff's department, which Ceballos claimed became heated and accusatory of his role in handling the case. Despite Ceballosâ€™ concerns, his supervisor decided to proceed with the prosecution. The criminal trial court held <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> motion, during which Ceballos was called by the defense to recount his observations about the affidavit. The trial court nevertheless denied the motion and upheld the warrant.|$|E
500|$|On March 21, Braves {{general manager}} Eddie Donovan {{announced}} that he would resign effective April 1.
