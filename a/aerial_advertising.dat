25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the American company Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company Inc. (CAMCO) was {{interested}} in means of <b>aerial</b> <b>advertising.</b> A requirement was identified for an 18-letter message to be displayed by means of electric lights, which would be easily readable at a range of 2–3 miles (3–5km). The use of blimps (non-rigid airships) was not considered economical, while a fixed wing aircraft carrying such a message would be much longer than any ever built.|$|E
25|$|Widerøe was {{established}} on {{the foundations of}} two small aircraft operators. The first was the company Lotsberg & Skappel. The other was Widerøe & Bjørneby, which was founded by Viggo Widerøe and Halvor Bjørneby. During the winter, they stationed aircraft at mountain resorts and made revenue from flying skiers into the wilderness. <b>Aerial</b> <b>advertising</b> flights were introduced, in which a company or product name was painted on an aircraft's fuselage, with a neon-light version underneath, and leaflets dropped mid-flight.|$|E

25|$|On August 23, 1952, a bi-plane piloted by Charles McKay and John Pretner {{took off}} from the island airport and crashed in the {{backyard}} of a home on Markham Street, near Dundas Street West in Toronto. Both men {{were killed in the}} crash and ensuing fire. The plane was used by owner Charles Catalano's <b>Aerial</b> <b>Advertising</b> Service to pull signs behind it over the annual Canadian National Exhibition (CNE). It was not pulling a sign {{at the time of the}} crash. McKay was a pilot for Catalano and Pretner was his guest aboard the plane. According to Catalano, the plane had passed an airworthiness test two weeks previous. According to witnesses, the pilot appeared to lose control of the plane when it went down. According to Donald Saunders, the Ontario District Air Regulations supervisor at the time, it was the first plane crash within Toronto since the island airport opened in 1938.|$|E

50|$|Often {{working in}} epic scale, Dirk Skreber's {{paintings}} monumentalise the banal. Figurative scenes of lone train carriages and road accidents aren’t tableaux of narrative spectacles, but abstract incidents of incomprehensible beauty and horror. Rendered perfect in their making, their surfaces are impenetrable, exacting and serene; they don’t offer spatial illusion, but vast fields of emptiness. Skreber does not strive for photorealism; his work only borrows from the tropes of mechanical reproduction. The soft focus of <b>advertising,</b> <b>aerial</b> views of surveillance photography and image replication of print media are placebos of intimacy. Translated into painting, these devices serve as filters transforming the familiar into the uncanny. Dirk Skreber uses the paint {{itself as a}} language of contradiction. Varying stylistically from seamless gradients to gestural rendering, his paintings don’t offer pictorial illusion, but instead, exploit their own material qualities. Photography captures a single moment in time; Skreber's paintings are frozen in expectation. In his more abstract work, Skreber transfers the sublime contemplation of modernism into a more frightening contemporary construct, where personal psychology is replaced by the public realm. Dirk Skreber presents trepidation as a normalised condition of collective consciousness, awe as a symptom of mass-media proliferation, and spirituality as an achievement of design.|$|R
50|$|<b>Aerial</b> <b>advertising</b> is {{effective}} if a large target audience is gathered near {{the source of}} advertising. Balloons, skywriting, and banner towing are usually strategically located. Long-range vehicles such as blimps and flogos can reach a broader audience along their flight route. Secondary distribution such as news media coverage, word of mouth and photos of <b>aerial</b> <b>advertising</b> can reach an extended audience. Due to safety, privacy, and aesthetic reasons, the ability to perform <b>aerial</b> <b>advertising</b> is regulated by local and federal entities throughout the world.|$|E

50|$|Detractors of <b>aerial</b> <b>advertising</b> {{maintain}} {{it has a}} highly limited and ineffective scope {{in the age of}} the internet. In particular, they state that the use of aircraft near two major metropolitan regions (NYC and D.C.) tends to be tightly regulated and restricted, and that, at least in the U.S., the use of aerial advertisement over sporting events with 30,000 or more in attendance is prohibited. <b>Aerial</b> <b>advertising</b> planes do fly before the events over the masses of tailgaters. A 2003 article by the Associated Press reports that aerial advertisement companies had lost a preliminary injunction against new federal security regulations, and all data indicate that the use of civilian fixed-wing aircraft over sporting events in the U.S. is forbidden.|$|E
