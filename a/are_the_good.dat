He was also praised for suppressing the local bullies and helping the weak. However, it was {{also said that he}} divorced his wife and married a Lady Li as his new wife. Lady Li was said to be promiscuous and jealous, but was greatly favored by Zhang. When they went to Xiang Prefecture, there was a young man who sold pens for a living and was good at singing and dancing. Lady Li carried on an affair with the young man, and, falsely declaring that Zhang had previously carried on an affair with the young man's mother, encouraging Zhang to adopt the young man as a son, to be named Zhang Shenji (張慎幾) — an act opposed by Zhang's son, by his former wife, Zhang Shenwei (張慎微), to no avail. It was also said that Lady Li favored witchcraft, engaging many witches, and interfered with Zhang's administration, and from that point on, Zhang's reputation began to suffer.|$|E
500|$|The Canadian {{government}} declined Mitsui's {{offer of}} military service. [...] A series of Orders in Council in 1942 deprived Canadians of Japanese descent {{of their property}} and rights, culminating in Japanese-Canadian internment {{for the duration of}} the war. [...] The government confiscated the Mitsui family's 17-acre property and poultry facilities in Coquitlam and sold it off, compensating the family with an estimated one-third of its total value. [...] The RCMP took Mitsui and his daughter Lucy to Hastings Park for registration as an enemy alien. [...] Mitsui wore his military medals and when the registering official asked him, [...] "What can I do for you, Sarge?", Mitsui responded, [...] "What are you doing to me? I served my country. [...] You've taken everything away from me.... What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> of my medals?" [...] He scattered his medals on the floor and table, and refused to wear them thereafter when they were returned to him. [...] He and his family were detained in a facility in Greenwood, British Columbia. [...] Mitsui later stated, [...] "I had complete confidence in the government that they wouldn't be doing anything to me because of being a veteran." [...] All the family could later retrieve was a samurai sword Mitsui's son George had buried.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1987 {{review of}} a {{biography}} of Hubbard, , Francis Hamit of the Daily News of Los Angeles wrote: [...] "Currently a recently discovered first novel, Buckskin Brigades, {{an account of the}} settlement of the Northwest Territories where the Indians <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> guys, is selling well and is further evidence of his considerable gift for writing compelling narrative." [...] Cecil D. Roy, Jr. reviewed the book for The Advocate (Baton Rouge), and wrote that [...] "Hubbard's style at times approaches the stilted, artificial style of some novelists of the late 19th and early 20th century," [...] and that Hubbard [...] "never achieves the easy flow of descriptive prose" [...] of writers Zane Grey and Stewart Edward White. Roy Jr. characterized the book as [...] "a good adventure novel of the West", but concluded with: [...] "..don't look for the true Mountain Man in Buckskin Brigades." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{an essay}} written {{specifically}} {{in answer to}} the biography, noted Wilson biographer John Milton Cooper offers his perspective, including this overarching comment: [...] "The quality of the writing in the book, the pleasure in reading it, and the warm human impression it leaves of its subject <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> news. The {{bad news is that}} the book leaves out much that it ought to include and includes some that it ought to leave out." [...] As an example of what he felt should have been included, Cooper notes [...] "In spite of the book’s strength in depicting Wilson’s family life, it is also oddly unsatisfactory about one of its most important figures: his father." [...] As another example, Cooper states that [...] "Equally glaring is the lack of attention to Wilson’s thought." [...] Cooper questions Berg's inclusion of the memories of Wilson wife by saying [...] "Kristie Miller’s excellent biography of Wilson’s two wives could have raised red flags about Edith’s memory." [...] Cooper not only disputes Berg's framing of Wilson's racism but also his religious perspective, calling into question the use of Bible quotations {{at the beginning of each}} chapter: [...] "Other reviewers have found this practice tiresome; I found it unenlightening and strange." [...] Cooper ends by saying [...] "To sum up, this biography has much to recommend it, especially the pleasure it affords in reading it. Its shortcomings make it far from balanced or comprehensive, much less “definitive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not {{long after}} the group formed, Foster wrote and {{recorded}} a song at Mophonics called [...] "Pumped Up Kicks", which eventually {{proved to be the}} band's breakthrough. After Foster posted the song on his website as a free download in early 2010, it drew considerable attention; Nylon magazine used the track in an online advertising campaign, and through various blogs, it went viral. The group, yet to be signed, garnered buzz with performances at the South by Southwest music festival in March 2010. Foster was emailed by many people about [...] "Pumped Up Kicks", and needing professional guidance, he contacted artist manager Brent Kredel at Monotone, Inc. in March, saying, [...] "Everyone is calling me and emailing me—what do I do? Who <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> guys, who are the bad guys?" [...] Kredel recalled that [...] "He went from the guy who couldn't get a hold of anyone to being the guy who had hundreds of emails in his inbox." [...] Kredel and Brett Williams were subsequently hired to co-manage Foster the People, and they arranged meetings for the band with several record labels, including Warner Bros., Atlantic, Columbia, and Universal Republic. In May 2010, the band was signed to the Columbia imprint Startime International in a multi-album deal. The deal did not involve ancillary rights. Foster controls publishing of the songs in North America, while a separate 2010 deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing controls publishing outside of North America.|$|E
