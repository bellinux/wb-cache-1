In the result of the study the article systemises and considers the conduct of the credit process of Ukrainian commercial banks. It becomes clear from result of the study {{that it is impossible to}} obtain a single assessment <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> <b>of</b> a borrower with generalisation of numerical and non-numerical data. Assessment of qualified analysts is required for a justified assessment <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> apart from information represented in numbers. Improvement of approaches to assessment <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> <b>of</b> borrowers and adaptation of the existing foreign experience in this field to specific features <b>of</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> <b>of</b> Ukrainian borrowers are important tasks for the Ukrainian banking system. Prospects of further studies in this direction are establishment of importance of the conduct of business analysis and its key role in assessment <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> <b>of</b> borrowers as a main instrument of minimisation of the credit risk. Improvement of this sphere of analytical work in Ukrainian banks should be carried out in the following main directions: study and analysis of qualitative indicators of business activity; analysis of main sections of the business plan; expansion of the composition of indicators of the financial analysis for obtaining information; conduct of analysis of possible sources of repayment of loan liabilities; and active use of analysis of cash flows of an enterprise...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contains}} a critique <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> regulation such as imposed on banks by Basel I and II. It argues that banks seeking to maximize {{rate of return}} on risk-adjusted capital (RORAC) aim at an optimal level <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> because on the one hand, solvency S lowers the cost of refinancing; on the other, it ties costly capital. In period 1, exogenous changes in mean returns dµ and in volatility occur, causing optimal adjustments dS * / dµ and dS * / ds in period 2. Since banks reallocate their assets with certain µ and s values in response to the changed solvency level, an endogenous trade-off with slope dµ / ds results in period 3. Both Basel I and II are shown to modify this slope, inducing at least some banks to opt for a higher value of s in certain situations. Therefore, this type <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> regulation can prove counter-productive...|$|R
