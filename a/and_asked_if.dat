5|$|After Whitlam left, Kerr {{called in}} Fraser, {{informed}} {{him of the}} dismissal, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he would form a caretaker government, to which Fraser agreed. Fraser later stated that his overwhelming sensation at the news was relief. Fraser left to return to Parliament House, where he conferred with Coalition leaders, while Kerr joined the luncheon party that {{had been waiting for}} him, apologising to his guests and offering the excuse that he had been busy dismissing the Government.|$|E
5|$|Dixon's {{first job}} was at Ladbrokes, {{although}} she aspired {{to become a}} PE teacher after leaving college. After completing a diploma course in sports studies, she had planned {{to take up a}} place at Loughborough University, but whilst at dance classes in London she was approached by a talent scout from a production company. Whilst travelling back home on the train she was approached by another scout who was forming a group <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> she was interested.|$|E

5|$|Purnell, Parsons, Tibbets, Spaatz and Curtis LeMay met on Guam on 7 August, the {{day after}} the Hiroshima attack, to discuss what should be done next. Parsons said that Project Alberta would have a Fat Man bomb ready by 11 August, as {{originally}} planned, but Tibbets pointed to weather reports indicating poor flying conditions on that day due to a storm, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> it could be readied by 9 August. Parsons agreed to do so.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{started the}} 2003 season 4–4, but lost their final eight games. With two games {{remaining}} in the season, Jim Fassel requested a meeting with team management, <b>and</b> <b>asked,</b> <b>if</b> {{he was to be}} fired, that they do so now rather than wait {{until the end of the}} season. Management complied with his request, formally firing Fassel on (or around) December 17, 2003, but allowing him to coach the team's final two games.|$|E
5|$|After {{the group}} disbanded, Schulz and Esch formed the band Slick Idiot, while Konietzko and Skold regrouped as MDFMK, adding singer Lucia Cifarelli {{to form a}} trio. MDFMK {{released}} one self-titled album with Republic/Universal Records, and toured North America. After being released from his contract with Universal due to a disagreement over who would produce the next album, Konietzko said he called Metropolis Records <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> they'd be interested in signing KMFDM. The label agreed, although at the time only Konietzko himself was certain to participate.|$|E

5|$|At {{this point}} Colonel Michaelis {{went to the}} 1st Cavalry Division command post in Hwanggan and asked {{division}} commander Major General Hobart R. Gay for permission to withdraw his regiment through that division. Gay telephoned the Eighth Army headquarters <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he should attack {{in an effort to}} relieve the pressure on the 27th Infantry, or if that regiment should withdraw into the 1st Cavalry Division's area, move south to Kumch'on, and then turn toward Sangju to rejoin the 25th Division. The Eighth Army decided the 27th Regiment should withdraw, as Gay feared it would quickly be surrounded if it tried to hold its position.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{had interviewed}} several actresses {{to play the}} blind flower girl but was unimpressed with them all. While seeing a film shoot with bathing women in a Santa Monica beach, he found a casual acquaintance, Virginia Cherrill. Cherrill waved <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> she would ever {{get the chance to}} work with him. After a series of poor auditions from other actresses, Chaplin {{eventually}} invited her to do a screen test. She was the first actress to subtly and convincingly act blind on camera due to her near-sightedness, and Cherrill signed a contract on November 1, 1928.|$|E
5|$|Early on 8 July, U-255 caught another {{ship from}} Convoy PQ 17, the 6,069 ton American {{merchant}} ship Olopana, loaded with 6,000 tons of explosives, gasoline, and trucks as deck cargo. A single torpedo hit the ship, blowing {{out all the}} bulkheads, and killing seven of the crew. The surviving crewmen abandoned ship on four rafts, as U-255 surfaced and fired 20 shells at the ship, which sank after 20 minutes. U-255 questioned the survivors, gave them a course to land, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> they had enough food and water before leaving. The survivors landed at Moller Bay, Novaya Zemlya, two days later.|$|E

5|$|Elvis Presley as Vince Everett, a {{prisoner}} who, after being released, becomes a star for his singing talent. Producer Pandro S. Berman's wife {{convinced him to}} make a film with Presley starring in the leading role. Berman contacted Presley's manager, Colonel Thomas Parker, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he could send Presley or Parker the script to read it. Parker was uninterested and denied the request. Berman asked Parker under which conditions would he take the project, to which Parker replied that he was only interested in the music score of the movie and owning the rights for record sales and publishing royalties. Presley's payment was settled at 250,000 and 50% of the royalties from the distribution of the movie.|$|E
5|$|George Holdcroft {{composed}} the score for The FP. He {{was invited to}} a screening of the film by producer Christian Agypt, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he could compose the music for it. Holdcroft, who lived in Chicago at the time, spent 12 hours a day composing the score and e-mailed his compositions to the Trost brothers. To emulate {{the sound of a}} choir for one song, Holdcroft sang the same segment more than 200 times using different voices and melodies to achieve the desired result. For another song, he sang in falsetto and altered the pitch of his voice to make himself sound like a woman.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Jamal Al-Durrah (born 1988) was {{in fifth}} grade, but his school was closed on 30 September 2000; the Palestinian Authority {{had called for}} a general strike and day of {{mourning}} following violence in Jerusalem the day before. His mother {{said he had been}} watching the rioting on television <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he could join in. Father and son decided instead to go to a car auction. Jamal had just sold his 1974 Fiat, Motro wrote, and Muhammad loved cars, so they went to the auction together.|$|E

50|$|In 1995, Nisan and Ta-Shma {{showed the}} {{surprising}} result that SL is closed under complement, {{which at the}} time was believed by many to be false; that is, SL = co-SL. Equivalently, if a problem can be solved by reducing it to a graph <b>and</b> <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> two vertices are in the same component, it can also be solved by reducing it to another graph <b>and</b> <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> two vertices are in different components. However, Reingold's paper would later make this result redundant.|$|R
5|$|Newt Lee, {{the night}} watchman, arrived at work shortly before 4:00 and Frank, who was {{normally}} calm, came bustling {{out of his}} office. Frank told Lee {{that he had not}} yet finished his own work and asked Lee to return at 6:00. Newt Lee noticed that Frank was very agitated <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he could sleep in the packing room, but Frank was insistent that Lee leave the building and told Lee to go out {{and have a good time}} in town before coming back.|$|E
5|$|Purnell, Parsons, Tibbets, Spaatz, and LeMay met on Guam {{that same}} day to discuss {{what should be done}} next. Since there was no {{indication}} of Japan surrendering, they decided to proceed with dropping another bomb. Parsons said that Project Alberta would have it ready by August 11, but Tibbets pointed to weather reports indicating poor flying conditions on that day due to a storm, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> the bomb could be readied by August 9. Parsons agreed to try to do so.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{negotiations}} with the union ended, the mine owners met secretly with Sheriff Bowers in Colorado Springs. They told Bowers they intended to bring in hundreds of nonunion workers, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he could protect such a large force of men. Bowers said he could not, for the county lacked the financial resources to pay and arm {{more than a few}} deputies. The mine owners offered to subsidize an initial force of a hundred or so men. Bowers agreed, and immediately began recruiting ex-police and ex-firefighters from Denver.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, at 09:35, two USAF F-15C fighter {{aircraft}} {{from the}} 53d Fighter Squadron, piloted by Captain Eric Wickson and Lieutenant Colonel Randy W. May, departed Incirlik AB. Their {{mission was to}} perform an initial fighter sweep of the TAOR to clear the area of any hostile aircraft prior to the entry of coalition forces. The air tasking order (ATO) {{that was supposed to}} list all scheduled coalition aircraft missions for that day and which the two pilots reviewed before takeoff, mentioned that U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters would be operating in the TAOR that day but did not list takeoff times, routes, or flight durations for them. At 10:15, Wickson radioed Martin on the AWACS <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he had any information to pass to them to which Martin replied in the negative.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 1940, John Randall and Harry Boot first ran their cavity {{magnetron}} at 10cm (3GHz). In April, GEC was told {{of their work}} <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> they could improve the design. They introduced new sealing methods and an improved cathode, delivering two examples capable of generating 10kW of power at 10cm, {{an order of magnitude}} better than any existing microwave device. At this wavelength, a half-dipole antenna was only a few centimetres long, and allowed Lovell's team to begin looking at parabolic reflectors, producing a beam only 5 degrees wide. This had the enormous advantage of avoiding ground reflections by simply not pointing the antenna downwards, allowing the fighter to see any target at its altitude or above it.|$|E
5|$|On April 3, the Spanish {{approached}} the chiefdom of Altamaha, {{led by a}} chief named Zamuno, who always bore arms in case of attack by Cofitachequi. It is unclear if De Soto entered the main town at the Shinholser site. Zamuno exchanged gifts with De Soto <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he should pay tribute directly to him, instead of to his overlord Ocute. De Soto replied that the previous relationship should stand. De Soto erected a cross and left behind a cannon somewhere in the chiefdom. He summoned the paramount chief of Ocute, and then visited his main town, apparently at the Shoulderbone site, on April 9. He received gifts and set up another cross, and the army rested for two days. On April 12, De Soto visited another subject chiefdom, Cofaqui, which was governed by a young noble named Patofa {{on behalf of his}} elderly uncle. Patofa reiterated his compatriots' policy of amity and gave the army provisions and porters.|$|E
