50|$|There {{was also}} {{no way to}} see a Cyclops image stored in the Altair. So work began on <b>a</b> <b>{{graphics}}</b> <b>interface</b> card which could connect the Altair to a color TV set. This graphics interface, called the Dazzler, {{was introduced in the}} February 1976 issue of Popular Electronics. One use for an Altair Computer with a Dazzler was to play games. But {{there was no way to}} interface a game console or joystick to the Altair. So the next project was to design a joystick console and an interface card that supported an 8-bit digital channel and 7 analog channels (called the D+7A). The D+7A could do much more than just interface a joystick, however, and it was this card that allowed the Altair to be connected to the world of data acquisition and industrial computing.|$|E

40|$|Robots prove {{advantageous}} for the deburring of {{machined parts}} {{because they are}} more repeatable than humans and suffer no fatigue. However, most deburring robots are programmed manually, requiring a large investment in programming time. At the National Bureau of Standards ' Automated Manufacturing Research Facility, research is being conducted on techniques to automate robot programming. Atechnique has been developed and demonstrated in the Cleaning and Deburring Workstation which uses CAD geometry data to automatically generate robot deburring paths. Using <b>a</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>interface,</b> an operator specifies the edges on a part to be deburred, the deburring tools to be used, and the speeds, feed rates, and contact forces desired. Deburring paths are generated and sent to a PUMA 760 robot controlled by the NBS Real-Time Control System. The robot uses a two-pass technique for deburring. On the first pass, the robot uses force feedback to correct the deburring path points to account for robot kinematic errors, tool wear, and minor part misplacement. On the second pass, the robot follows the corrected path, deburring the part. This paper describes the techniques, algorithms and data formats used in this robotic deburring system...|$|E
