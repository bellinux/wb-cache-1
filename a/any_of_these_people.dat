Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people?</b> None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E

[...] In The Times, Paul Hoggart summarised all six episodes as [...] " [...] a tightrope between satire and sentimentality, frequently falling off on the sugary side", but wrote positively of the writing, directing, acting, and editing. He approved of the deliberately unhappy ending, {{looking forward to seeing}} how Rachel's departure would be resolved in the second series. Andy Harries attributed the mixed critical reaction to the unusual timeslot the series was given.|$|E

Previous studies have reported that demographic and disease-related aspects can predict whether a person with MS will leave their job. The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the factors that people with MS believe to contribute to their employment status and to determine whether <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> differentiate <b>people</b> with MS who are employed from those who are not employed. A multinational questionnaire assessed aspects related to employment that facilitate or hinder job maintenance. Data was collected in 18 European countries. A total of 1, 141 questionnaires were completed. Of those responding, 694 (61 %) subjects were employed and 477 (39 %) were unemployed. The items that significantly differentiated the groups were related to MS symptoms, workplace environment and financial considerations. While MS influences employment status for many people who face difficult symptoms, aspects like a flexible work schedule and financial security are important and perhaps key to promoting job maintenance among people with MS...|$|R

6000|$|But {{here is to}} {{be noted}} the {{essential}} difference between Russia and Prussia; especially by those who use the ordinary Liberal arguments against the latter. Russia has a policy which she pursues, if you will, through evil and good; but at least so as to produce good as well as evil. Let it be granted that the policy has made her oppressive to the Finns and the Poles--though the Russian Poles feel far less oppressed than do the Prussian Poles. But it is a mere historic fact, that if Russia has been a despot to some small nations, {{she has been a}} deliverer to others. She did, so far as in her lay, emancipate the Servians and the Montenegrins. But whom did Prussia ever emancipate--even by accident? It is indeed somewhat extraordinary that in the perpetual permutations of international politics, the Hohenzollerns have never gone astray into the path of enlightenment. They have been in alliance with almost everybody off and on: with France, with England, with Austria, with Russia. Can anyone candidly say that they have left on <b>any</b> one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> the faintest impress of progress or liberation? Prussia was the enemy of the French Monarchy; but a worse enemy of the French Revolution. Prussia had been an enemy of the Czar; but she was a worse enemy of the Duma. Prussia totally disregarded Austrian rights: but she is to-day quite ready to inflict Austrian wrongs. This is the strong particular difference between the one empire and the other. Russia is pursuing certain intelligible and sincere ends, which to her at least are ideals, and for which, therefore, she will make sacrifices and will protect the weak. But the North German soldier is a sort of abstract tyrant, everywhere and always on the side of materialistic tyranny. This Teuton in uniform has been found in strange places; shooting farmers before Saratoga and flogging soldiers in Surrey, hanging niggers in Africa and raping girls in Wicklow; but never, by some mysterious fatality, lending a hand to the freeing of a single city or the independence of one solitary flag. Wherever scorn and prosperous oppression are, there is the Prussian; unconsciously consistent, instinctively restrictive, innocently evil; [...] "following darkness like a dream." ...|$|R
