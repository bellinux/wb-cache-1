40|$|Microalgae are {{a diverse}} group of single-cell {{photosynthetic}} organisms that include cyanobacteria and a wide range of eukaryotic algae. A number of microalgae contain high-value compounds such as oils, colorants, and polysaccharides, which are used by the food <b>additive,</b> <b>oil,</b> and cosmetic industries, among others. They offer the potential for rapid growth under photoautotrophic conditions, and they can grow {{in a wide range of}} habitats. More recently, the development of genetic tools means that a number of species can be transformed and hence used as cell factories for the production of high-value chemicals or recombinant proteins. In this article, we review exploitation use of microalgae with a special emphasis on genetic engineering approaches to develop cell factories, and the use of synthetic ecology approaches to maximize productivity. We discuss the success stories in these areas, the hurdles that need to be overcome, and the potential for expanding the industry in general...|$|E
40|$|Biodiesel is the {{alternate}} fuel which {{is derived from}} renewable sources either is vegetable oils or animal fats. Biodiesel is non-toxic, have higher biodegradability, free of sulphur, no aromatics and its oxygen content of about 10 - 11 % which is usually not contained in diesel fuel. These characteristics thus predominantly influences to the emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) in the exhaust gas. Purpose {{of this study is}} to investigate the effects of fuel <b>additive,</b> <b>oil</b> palm blended fuel, engine speed and test load conditions on the exhaust emissions and engine performance. The engine speed was varied from 1500 to 3000 rpm, load test condition varied by dynapack chassis dynamometer in 0, 50 and 100 % and blends of 5 (B 5), 10 (B 10) and 15 vol%(B 15) palm oil with the diesel fuel. Increased of blends ratio with same mixing booster quantity can improve the engine performance, combustion process and give less CO emission.

50|$|Although {{motor oil}} is {{manufactured}} with numerous <b>additives,</b> aftermarket <b>oil</b> <b>additives</b> exist, too. A glaring inconsistency of mass-marketed aftermarket <b>oil</b> <b>additives</b> {{is that they}} often use additives which are foreign to motor oil.

40|$|In {{enhanced}} oil recovery (EOR), {{the objective of}} chemical flooding is to recover additional oil after a waterflood. However, chemical flooding is not widely applied in the oil fields due to {{the high cost of}} chemicals. The goal of this study is produce pyrolytic oil from oil palm shell as {{enhanced oil}} recovery <b>additive.</b> <b>Oil</b> palm shell as a solid waste from the palm oil industrs was converted into liquid oil by a fast bed pyrolytic process. The pyrolysis oil was collected in ice– cooled collector. The chemical compositions of the pyrolysis oil were then analyzed by Gas Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry (GC – MS). The chemical composition of pyrolysis oil was complex, comprising of mainly phenolic compounds, carboxylic acids and aldehydes. The physical properties of pyrolysis oil were also carried out. The phenolic compounds were further separated from the pyrolysis oil by liquid-liquid extraction using alkali and organic solvent. The extracted phenol fractions were analyzed by the Fourier Transform Infra-red (F. T. I. R) spectroscopy. Those phenolic compounds {{can be used as a}} starting material in the development of chemicals for enhanced oil recovery because they are inexpensive, high recoverability, and the most important thing is, they are not petroleum derivatives...|$|E
40|$|Refined Soybean Oil (RSBO) was freshly {{obtained}} {{before adding}} any additive {{from a local}} Vegetable Oil factory in Owo, Ondo- State, Nigeria. Ripped peels of banana and plantain were removed from their fruits, cut, sun dried, ground, sieved and separately extracted with methanol. The methanol extracts were dosed at varying concentrations (0. 02 %- 0. 10 %) into RSBO. RSBO containing 0. 02 % and 0. 04 % of citric acid (CA) were also set up for comparison. The stability effects of methanol extracts and citric acid of RSBO were evaluated by monitoring the Free Fatty Acid (FFA), Acid Value (AV) and Peroxide Value (PV) of the oil sample monthly {{for a period of}} six months. The results indicated that RSBO containing both extracts (0. 02 %- 0. 10 %) and citric acid were more oxidatively stable than RSBO that contained no <b>additive.</b> <b>Oil</b> samples containing 0. 08 %- 0. 10 % banana peel extract, 0. 08 % plantain peel extract and citric acid (0. 02 %- 0. 10 %) were more hydrolytically stable than oil sample that contained no additive. Plantain peel extract in RSBO competed more favourably with citric acid than banana peel extract in terms of oxidative stability of RSBO. The plantain peel extract had higher antioxidative activity than banana peel extract against oxidative deterioration of RSBO.

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of {{lubricating}} <b>oil</b> <b>additive</b> diesel fuel on the diesel engine emission particles characterizations, such as size distribution, morphology, nanostructure and composition was investigated on a light-duty diesel engine. Fast particle spectrum analysis {{was used for the}} determination of size distribution, and transmission electric microscopy (TEM) technique for the investigation of morphology of particles. On the other hand, the element carbon fraction can be obtained through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Compared with the emission particles from burning pure diesel fuel, the emission particles from burning lubricating <b>oil</b> <b>additive</b> diesel fuel have lower fractal dimension. Measurement results of the nanostructure parameters show that emission particles from burning <b>oil</b> <b>additive</b> dosed fuel have lower graphite structure than those from burning pure diesel fuel. TGA results indicate that more volatile and ash fraction were contained in the particles when <b>oil</b> <b>additive</b> was mixed into diesel. In conclusion, the <b>oil</b> <b>additive</b> may increase the nucleation mode particles and ash component. Therefore, the enhanced performance of diesel particulate filter (DPF) system may be required.
