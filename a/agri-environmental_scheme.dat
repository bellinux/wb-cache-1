Swiss integration into the EU would reinforce the already existing trend towards renunciation of an essentially productivist farming ethos in an economic environment still largely free from the problems of agricultural overproduction.

A life cycle assessment (LCA) method was adopted to estimate emissions per kilogram of CO 2 equivalent per kilogram of live weight (LW) leaving the farm gate per annum (kg CO 2 kg− 1 LW yr− 1) and per hectare (kg CO 2 ha− 1 yr− 1). Fifteen units engaged in suckler-beef production (five conventional, five in an Irish <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>scheme,</b> and five organic units) were evaluated for emissions per unit product and area.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we broaden {{the debate on}} <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>scheme</b> {{participation}} to include farm woodland expansion and renewable energy production, developing a conceptualisation of ‘agri-environmental diversification’. Utilising structural equation modelling, we assess a telephone survey of 2416 Scottish farmers, undertaken in 2013. Findings demonstrate the path dependencies of farming participants, with those already engaged {{in each of these}} activities the most likely to plan to be involved in future. Similar factors have influenced the uptake of all three activities since 2005, and intention to increase involvement by 2020. Farmers who are: younger, better educated, information-seeking, certified as organic, receive subsidies, have non-farming income and plan to continue farming in the medium term, are more likely to plan for future engagement in the three activities. Environmental attitudes are also important, but a stronger relationship was found between observation of environmental gains from agri-environmental schemes and the three forms of agri-environmental diversification, suggesting that scheme involvement enables farmers to learn to produce, recognise and value environmental goods. We argue that when assessed within the broader perspective of agri-environmental diversification, <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>scheme</b> participation may represent an initial step on a farming trajectory that involves multiple forms of agri-environmental engagement...|$|E

40|$|Farmers’ {{attitudes towards}} {{viability}} of specific conservation practices or actions strongly impact their decisions on adoption and change. This review of ‘attitude’ information reveals {{a wide range}} of perceptions about what conservation means and what the impacts of adoption will mean in economic and environmental terms. Farmers operate in a tight financial situation, and in parts of the world they are highly dependent on government subsidies, and cannot afford to risk losing that support. Use of conservation practices is most effective when these are understood {{in the context of the}} individual farm, and decisions are rooted in land and resource stewardship and long-term concerns about health of the farm and the soil. The attitudes of farmers entering <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>schemes</b> decide the quality of the result. A model is developed to show how attitudes of the farmer, the farming context and <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>schemes</b> interact and thus influence how the farming community affects nature and biodiversity.

40|$|AbstractEuropean <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>schemes</b> {{are being}} criticised for {{reinforcing}} rather than negating an opposition between agricultural production and environmental production, and for assuming instead of securing a public {{willingness to pay}} for agri-environmental change. This paper explores if a regionalisation of agri-environmental governance may contribute to overcome these criticisms. The paper empirically explores three regionalised <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>schemes</b> from Flanders, Belgium, {{with the use of}} 40 qualitative interviews with farmers and other relevant stakeholders. Building on the Bourdieusian theory of capital and the conceptual distinction between bonding and bridging social capital, the paper analyses whether and why the regionalised arrangements incited farmers to integrate environmental production in their farm management to meet other regional stakeholders’ demands for agri-environmental change. In doing so, the paper particularly focuses on the role of bridging social capital in fostering farmer participation in agri-environmental governance, which is a topic that—despite a growing scholarly recognition of the importance of social capital in mediating farmers’ environmental behaviour—has to date received scant conceptual and empirical attention. The paper reveals that farmers principally participated in the regionalised <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>schemes</b> to enhance the long-term viability of their agricultural businesses by building up more cooperative and appreciative, bridging social ties with other regional stakeholders. Notably, such participation is only likely to be substantive and lead to long-term, pro-environmental behaviour change of farmers, if farmers actually succeed in building up bridging social capital by receiving other regional stakeholders’ appreciation for their agri-environmental work.

40|$|Animal {{husbandry}} is a {{major source}} of nutrient loading. Both feed production and manure spreading cause nutrient emissions into ground and surface waters. In regions where intensive animal husbandry meets soils already rich in phosphorus, risk for eutrophication increases. This article analyses how livestock installations and manure spreading are regulated as potential sources of nutrient loading in Finland. The regulation is a complex mix of economic and command-and-control instruments. The agri-environmental subsidy scheme acts as the primary tool in regulating agricultural water pollution. In Finland, about 90 % of farms have been committed to the <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>scheme</b> and its terms, but as shown in the paper, the share is decreasing and may well continue to do so as agricultural production continues to intensify. For the farms outside the <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>scheme,</b> general legal standards limit fertilisation, but in a less strict manner. Additional local restrictions can be established by municipal regulations. The environmental permit scheme covers vast majority of livestock installations. Stipulations issued in the permits do not only regulate the emissions from the livestock installation as a point source, but extend to regulate even the spreading of manure, which is often contracted out and spread on the fields by other farmers. The analysis indicates that the regulatory system suffers from unnecessary duplication, sometimes even incoherency. As a result, regulation seems to place a relatively high regulatory burden on farmers and authorities. Questions on optimal regulatory approach – and the role of legal standards and environmental permits in particular – are further stressed by ongoing structural development in livestock production: as farm size continues to grow and farms become ever more specialised, manure management will be decoupled from the livestock installation...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable {{agricultural}} practices {{in conjunction with}} ecological restoration methods can reduce the detrimental effects of agriculture. The Society for Ecological Restoration International has produced generic guidelines for conceiving, organizing, conducting and assessing ecological restoration projects. Additionally, there are now good conceptual frameworks, guidelines and practical methods for developing ecological restoration programmes {{that are based on}} sound ecological principles and supported by empirical evidence and modelling approaches. Restoration methods must also be technically achievable and socially acceptable and spread over a range of locations. It is important to reconcile differences between methods that favour conservation and those that favour economic returns, to ensure that conservation efforts are beneficial for both landowners and biodiversity. One option for this type of mutual benefit is the use of <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>schemes</b> to provide financial incentives to landholders in exchange for providing conservation services and other benefits. However, further work is required to define and measure the effectiveness of <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>schemes.</b> The broader potential for ecological restoration to improve the sustainability of agricultural production while conserving biodiversity in farmscapes and reducing external costs is high, but there is still much to learn, particularly for the most efficient use of <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>schemes</b> to change land use practice...|$|R
40|$|With {{regard to}} <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>schemes</b> under Regulation (EC) No. 1257 / 1999 in Europe a rather divers uptake {{as well as}} a lack of {{effectiveness}} and efficiency of these current schemes can be observed. In contrast to most of the related literature, we suggest that the ineffectiveness and inefficiency is inherent to the way those schemes are currently institutionalised in the framework of European agricultural policies. The paper draws on experiences made within the GRANO research project on Approaches for Sustainable Agricultural Production in Northeast Germany. Among other sub-projects, round tables, so-called Agri-Environmental Forums (AEF), were installed in two districts in Brandenburg to integrate local actors directly into the process of designing and implementing local <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>schemes</b> in order to improve their economic and ecological efficiency. While the participants were successful in designing such local scheme, it did not become part of the Rural Development Plan in Brandenburg. Based on this case study, we argue that the process of designing <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>schemes</b> in Germany can be conceptualised as a rather complex negotiation process at Laender level. The institutional settings in which this negotiation process takes place shape the possible outcomes and, thus, the design of the schemes. With only passive support for decentralised and participatory approaches, yet compulsory complex bureaucratic procedures on part of the EU, there are no incentives for the administration at Laender level to actively support those approaches. Further, it can not be expected that the lack of effectiveness and efficiency can be wiped out completely from the current European Agri-environmental Policy framework. Therefore, we have to drop the assumption that agri-environmental issues in general can be solved through <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>schemes</b> alone.
