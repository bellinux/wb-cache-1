[...] The single portrays a [...] "modern" [...] electropop song and a pop ballad, which acts as a departure from her previous dance styles. It also serves as the first ballad released in her career. Lyrically, the recording delves on themes of new beginnings, choices {{that can be made}} in difficult situations in order to move forward, and discovering the joy of being yourself. In interviews, Stan expressed that the content of [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] is personal and refers to her recovery following her alleged violent incident previously mentioned with Prodan.

50|$|Before {{there was}} a {{specialty}} recognized as forensic nursing, the term used was clinical forensic medicine.

A strong advocate for the forensic nursing specialty in United States was Virginia Lynch. She pushed to have the specialty recognized and helped to form programs in the U.S. for proper education.

40|$|This {{relative}} {{dearth of}} material {{is due to}} a number of obvious and some less obvious factors. 1948 is the marker of transformation in Palestine and the historic moment whose shadow hangs over everything, including scholarship, though the Nakba is an on-going colonial process of which the war in 1967 is a major aspect. For historians, working on the Nakba within the (narrow) lens of 1948 has been a duty of national importance. After all, the mere scope and size of Zionist mythology on the matter has taken decades to counter.

2500|$|The Pesher on Psalms has {{the theme}} of {{salvation}} that takes part of an interpretation on those who are wrongdoers before the eyes of God and how those who do good will see the rewards of life.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} developments in macroeconomic policy-making {{over the last two decades}} has been the growing recognition that inflation is usually bad for economic growth. There is still substantial disagreement among researchers, however, <b>about</b> <b>how</b> quantitatively <b>important</b> are the growth depressing effects of inflation and at what levels of inflation these effects begin to appear. Some economists have been concerned by rates of inflation of three or four percent while others have been unconcerned by rates of twenty or thirty percent. A recent paper by Sarel (1996) makes an important contribution to the research literature on the growth effects of inflation. Much of the literature has assumed that the effects of inflation on growth are linear. But threshold rates of inflation may have to be surpassed before the growth depressing effects of inflation become important. Sarel shows that failure to take such thresholds into account leads to a substantial downward bias in estimates of the growth costs of inflation. Most analysis of nonlinear or threshold effects (such as Fischer, 1993; Barro, 1996; and Sarel, 1996) groups together industrial and developing countries. Recent research has demonstrated that the size of the growthdepressin...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUniversity Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) need a {{wide range}} of {{abilities}} to facilitate commercial exploitation of research outputs; however, we know relatively little <b>about</b> <b>how</b> these <b>important</b> abilities are developed and refined over time. We draw on practice-based studies of learning to create a novel conceptualization of learning processes and their outcomes in TTOs and show that this conceptualization of learning provides new empirical insights into how learning in TTOs shapes their commercialization practice. We investigate learning-in-practice in case studies of six UK TTOs and find two approaches to commercialization, namely transactions-focused practice and relations-focused practice. We find that both practices co-exist and co-evolve in some TTOs while other TTOs are predominantly transactions-focused. For the latter the development of a relations-focused approach is difficult, but possible if there is strategic direction and if sources of inertia are removed by TTO directors. Given that evolving practice cannot be fully explained by informal learning processes, we suggest that so far separate streams of practice-based literature on learning and strategizing should be brought together. The implications for further investigations of TTO abilities and some recommendations for policy and practice are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The idea of {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) is based on voluntary responsibility of companies for their operations in economic, social and environmental spheres {{as well as for}} ethical behavior. In accounting, it is reflected in the form of social accounting which deals with disclosing information on the organization’s achievements in respect of the CSR concept implementation. During the current economic crisis, company relationships with employees have become the most important of all the issues related to CSR. Additional challenges in this respect are posed by Generation Y comprising the people born after 1980 who enter the labor market.
