5000|$|Zoom lenses (sometimes {{referred}} to as [...] "true" [...] zoom) are ideally parfocal in that focus is maintained as the lens is zoomed (focal length and magnification changed), which not only is convenient, but also {{has the advantage of}} allowing more <b>accurate</b> <b>focusing</b> at maximal focal length and then zooming back to a shorter focal length to compose the image.|$|R
50|$|The {{direction}} of this displacement indicates the {{direction of}} the necessary focus correction.

50|$|The Contax I had six {{identifiable}} variants, but fundamentally identical; {{every aspect}} {{was designed to}} be better than the Leica. For instance, the removable back was for faster loading and reloading, the bayonet lens mount was designed for rapid lens interchangeability, the long-base rangefinder was for more <b>accurate</b> <b>focusing</b> with large aperture lenses, and the vertical metal shutter not only gave a faster maximum speed but also banished the problem of shutter blinds burning.|$|R
5000|$|Wide angle lens - a lens that reproduces {{perspective}} that generally looks [...] "wider" [...] than a normal lens. The problem {{posed by the}} design of wide-angle lenses is to bring to an <b>accurate</b> <b>focus</b> light from a wide area without causing internal flare.

5000|$|These pairings are {{the same}} as those used for later Leica M series camera viewfinders (Leica M4-P and {{subsequent}} models) and use the same frameline selection mechanism at the lens mount. A frameline preview lever {{on the front of the}} camera allows for temporary selection of a frameline pair other than the one selected by the mounted lens. The [...]60x magnification used in the Hexar RF viewfinder allows for all framelines to be easily seen, including by those wearing eyeglasses - even the 28 mm frameline (the largest). This also allows for generous amounts of [...] "outside the frame" [...] space in the viewfinder for other focal lengths, which can aid photographic composition.

50|$|A {{dual speed}} focuser can provide two {{focusing}} speeds {{by using a}} set of co-axial knobs, one for fast focusing and another for fine focusing when the film or CCD is near the perfect focal plane. This {{is different from the}} two separate focusing knobs seen on low level microscopes. Another common reason to employ a dual-speed focuser is with the use of short focal length eyepieces, where the depth of focus is short, requiring critically <b>accurate</b> <b>focusing.</b>|$|R

The preferred technique is a phase retrieval method which solves for certain Zernike coefficients, usually focus, coma and astigmatism, from model fits to the nearly in-focus PSFs. Here, we discuss what data from the ongoing monitoring strategies and special observations tell us about modes and timescales observed in HST optical variations, and suggest examining the current scientific need for PSF characterization. As the primary purpose for this monitoring is to support <b>accurate</b> <b>focus</b> maintenance, we also present {{a picture of the}} current focus state of the Observatory...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{focusing}} is {{a critical}} challenge of whole slide imaging, primarily due to inherent tissue topography variability. Traditional line scanning and tile-based scanning systems are limited {{in their ability to}} acquire a high degree of focus points while still maintaining high throughput. This review examines limitations with first-generation whole slide scanning systems and explores a novel approach that employs continuous autofocus, referred to as independent dual sensor scanning. This "second-generation" concept decouples image acquisition from focusing, allowing for rapid scanning while maintaining continuous <b>accurate</b> <b>focus.</b> The technical concepts, merits, and limitations of this method are explained and compared to that of a traditional whole slide scanning system...|$|E
40|$|A novel multi-spectral focus {{measure that}} is based on {{algorithms}} for interest point detection, particularly on the FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test), Fast Hessian and Harris-Laplace detector, is described in this paper. The proposed measure methods are compared with commonly used focus measure techniques like energy of image gradient, sum-modified Laplacian, Tenenbaum's algorithm or spatial frequency when testing their reliability and performance. The measures have been tested on a newly created database containing 420 images acquired in visible, near-infrared and thermal spectrum (7 objects in each spectrum). Algorithms based on the interest point detectors proved to be good focus measures satisfying all the requirements described in the paper, especially in thermal spectrum. It is shown that these algorithms outperformed all commonly used methods in thermal spectrum and therefore can serve as a new and more <b>accurate</b> <b>focus</b> measure...|$|E

50|$|Today the CL is a superbly {{compact and}} quite cheap camera {{on which to}} mount M-mount lenses, {{but it does not}} have a {{rangefinder}} as precise as that of any Leica M body. The rangefinder base of the CL is 31.5 mm and the viewfinder magnification is 0.60, leading to a small effective rangefinder base of 18.9 mm. This is too short for <b>accurate</b> <b>focusing</b> with lenses longer than 90mm and fast lenses used at full aperture. Some users report the camera is rather fragile, especially the rangefinder alignment and meter mechanism.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new SAR data {{processing}} algorithm denoted with Extended Omega-K (EOK) is analytically presented and formulated.

The new EOK algorithm integrates a two-step range adaptive motion compensation correction in the general formulation of the wavenumber domain algorithm, leading to a new SAR processing scheme, which is much more robust concerning long synthetic apertures and squint angle than for example the chirp-scaling method. Additionally it offers the possibility of processing wideband low-frequency airborne SAR data up to near-wavelength resolution.

40|$|Single {{particle}} reconstruction {{using the}} random conical tilt data collection geometry is a robust method {{for the initial}} determination of macromolecular structures by electron microscopy. Unfortunately, the broad adoption of this powerful approach has been limited by the practical challenges inherent in manual data collection of the required pairs of matching high and low tilt images (typically 60 ° and 0 °). The microscopist is obliged to keep the imaging area centered during tilting {{as well as to}} maintain <b>accurate</b> <b>focus</b> in the tilted image while minimizing the overall electron dose, a challenging and time consuming process. To help solve these problems, we have developed an automated system for the rapid acquisition of accurately aligned and focused tilt pairs. The system has been designed to minimize the dose incurred during alignment and focusing, making it useful in both negative stain and cryo-electron microscopy. The system includes a feature for montaging untilted images to ensure that all of the particles in the tilted image may be used in the reconstruction...|$|E
40|$|Recent PET results {{indicate}} that the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor density measured with the BZ receptor antagonist [11 C]flumazenil is reduced in human epileptic foci. The present study examines the applicability of this finding in the presurgical investigation of patients with intractable partial epilepsy. In eight patients, the PET measurements were performed after injection of the BZ receptor antagonist [11 C]flumazenil and [2 - 18 F] 2 -deoxy- 2 -fluoro-D-glucose ([18 F]FDG) [...] a tracer for measurements of the rate of regional glucose metabolism. The focus localising ability of the two PET tracers was examined using extra [...] and intracranial EEG recordings as reference. The focus was first determined visually on the PET images obtained after a bolus injection of each of the PET tracers. Its anatomical localisation and spatial delimitation was then evaluated for each patient with a computerised anatomical brain atlas. [11 C]flumazenil was found to be a more sensitive and <b>accurate</b> <b>focus</b> localiser than [18 F]FDG. This observation was valid both for quantified and non-quantified images. In the preoperative diagnosis of epileptic foci, the PET measurements of BZ receptors may be a suitable and, in some cases, superior method to the generally used "[18 F]FDG-PET" method...|$|E
40|$|Estimation of geoacoustic {{models of}} the sea bed is an {{underlying}} research issue in understanding acoustic propagation in shallow water environments where the propagation is generally bottom limited. Inversion methods based on matched field processing have become widely used in applications with experimental data at various sites worldwide. Traditionally, the experiments {{have been carried out}} with controlled source geometries. This paper presents a new experimental approach that makes use of the noise radiated by passing ships as the sound source for the inversion. Ship noise data were measured on a 16 -element vertical line array in shallow water off the west coast of Vancouver Island. The data were filtered into low (70 - 110 Hz) and high (170 - 290 Hz) frequency bands, and processed in an inversion algorithm based on back propagation of the spectral components of the noise signal. The geoacoustic model that generated the most <b>accurate</b> <b>focus</b> at the source location was taken as the best estimate. The band limited data allowed estimation separately of geoacoustic model parameters of the sea floor with the high frequencies, and then for the deeper layers using the low frequencies. The estimated model parameters compared well with ground truth data from a seismic survey and from sediment samples at the sit...|$|E

50|$|The trough {{is usually}} aligned on a north-south axis, and rotated {{to track the}} sun as it moves across the sky each day. Alternatively, the trough can be aligned on an east-west axis; this reduces the overall {{efficiency}} of the collector due to cosine loss but only requires the trough to be aligned with the change in seasons, avoiding the need for tracking motors. This tracking method approaches theoretical efficiencies at {{the spring and fall}} equinoxes with less <b>accurate</b> <b>focusing</b> of the light at other times during the year. The daily motion of the sun across the sky also introduces errors, greatest at the sunrise and sunset and smallest at solar noon. Due to these sources of error, seasonally adjusted parabolic troughs are generally designed with a lower concentration acceptance product.|$|R
