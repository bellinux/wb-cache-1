25|$|The Foundation is the <b>authorised</b> <b>staffing</b> {{establishment}} of the cathedral, few of whom are clergy. The head of the cathedral is the dean, currently Robert Willis, who is assisted by a chapter of 30 canons, four of whom are residentiary, the others being honorary appointments of senior clergy in the diocese. There are also a number of lay canons who altogether form the greater chapter which has the legal responsibility both for the cathedral itself and also for the formal election of an archbishop {{when there is a}} vacancy-in-see. By English law and custom they may only elect the person who has been nominated by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister. The Foundation also includes the choristers, lay clerks, organists, King's Scholars, the Six Preachers and a range of other officers; some of these posts are moribund, such as that of the cathedral barber. The cathedral has a work force of over 300 (many of whom work part-time), and approximately 800 volunteers.|$|R

SecuriTAS may change the conditions for accessing an office, for example, based on the presence of high cost resources, or the presence of highly <b>authorised</b> <b>staff.</b> This is achieved through an autonomic controller that updates and analyses a set of models (that define system objectives and vulnerabilities, threats to the system, and importance of resources in terms of a cost value) at run-time.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to explore {{priorities}} of supply chain partners for the integrated flow of information during the provision of industrial services. We adopted a qualitative multi-case logic methodology and a research model of flow integration and partnership uncertainty which we applied in an exploratory study with five major companies that provide aerospace services. From the analysis, we found that in view of the challenges for reducing partnership uncertainty and for enhancing integrated flow, firms prioritised how historical service data was made available to <b>authorised</b> <b>staff</b> and how lessons were learnt from existing service projects. We also found that congruity of aircraft platforms and duologues during service phases are important priorities in decision making situations of firms towards their supply chains for industrial services; and that these priorities are often driven by unplugged communication gaps and obsolescence of technologies...|$|E

50|$|In 1981, Kombo Moyana left UNCTAD to join Mr Bernard Chidzero, former Deputy Secretary General of UNCTAD and Minister of Finance in Zimbabwe at the time. Other {{members of}} the Branch had to cover Sub-Saharan Africa waiting for the {{replacement}} of Mr Moyana. In particular, Mr Cosío-Pascal covered Liberia, Madagascar and Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo). Four countries, in 1981, agreed to form the initial DMFAS pool—contributing from their national United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) funds to a common technical cooperation fund with UNCTAD—that allowed {{the development of the}} first version. Those countries were two from Latin America: Bolivia and Costa Rica and two from Africa: Liberia and Madagascar. These resources allowed hiring a systems analyst, Pekka Sankala Finland and a programmer, Ms Cameron Turkey. These two persons, jointly with Mr Cosio-Pascal, team leader, and Mr Baert, formed the first DMFAS Programme team. The first DMFAS version, finalised in early 1982, was developed in COBOL and designed to run on an IBM System/370 mainframe computer. This very first version was installed at the National Institute of Statistics of Bolivia, which was the only institution in Bolivia owning an IBM 370 computer. However, at the time, the country was governed by a Military Junta, the Head of State being General Luis García Meza, and it was decided by the Bolivian authorities that external debt data was classified information, and no one should be able to access it, {{with the exception of the}} authorised persons belonging to the International Department of the Central Bank of Bolivia. Therefore, it was requested to UNCTAD to develop a DMFAS version for Personal Computer (PC) that should be at the Central Bank with limited access to <b>authorised</b> <b>staffs.</b> This was a very fortunate request, because PC’s prices subsequently went down, being by far less expensive than mainframe computers, and since all DMFAS versions have be created to run on PCs. The second version of DMFAS, the PC version, was installed at the Central Bank of Bolivia, the Central Bank of Costa Rica and the Central Bank of Madagascar. It was never installed in Liberia due to the recrudescence of civil war.|$|R

40|$|Over the years, the {{advancement}} in computing technology, {{the reliability of}} computers, coupled {{with the development of}} easy-to-use but nevertheless sophisticated software has led to significant changes in the way that data are collected and analyzed. Computations has shifted from off-site main frames, dependent on highly trained operators and located in special rooms accessible only to certain <b>authorised</b> <b>staff,</b> to the more accessible desktop and laptop computers. This accessibility has resulted in an increasing number of researches in data mining in which hidden predictive information are extracted from large databases, using techniques from database research, artificial intelligence and statistics, {{to a wide variety of}} domains such as finance, manufacturing and medicine. In this research we describe our experiments on the application of Classification And Regression Tree (CART) to predict the survival of AIDS. CART builds classification and regression trees for predicting continuous dependent variables and categorical or predictor variables, and by predicting the most likely value of the dependent variable. In this paper, a total of 998 patients who had been diagnosed with AIDS were grouped according to prognosis by CART. We found that CART were able to predict the survival of AIDS with an accuracy of 60 - 93 % based on selected dependent variables, validated using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC). This could be useful in determining potential treatment methods and monitoring the progress of treatment for AIDS patients...|$|E
40|$|A City Council {{administration}} in Victoria, Australia developed {{a vision for}} a Corporate Information Management Strategy (CIMS), and envisaged that CIMS would provide {{the foundation for the}} organization to make better use of its knowledge.

25|$|The Admiralty {{were not}} {{initially}} encouraging to Hawker's approaches, {{in part due}} {{the presence of the}} in-development jet-powered Supermarine Attacker aircraft. However, the service was intrigued by the long-range capability of the P.1040, {{as well as by the}} promise of increased power from the Nene engine. Thus, in May 1946, the Naval <b>Staff</b> <b>authorised</b> the manufacture of three prototypes and a further test specimen, one of these being the original prototype internally ordered by Hawker, in accordance with Naval Specification N.7/46. Hawker quickly found their development focus for the type being divided between the navy's P.1046 and the general-purpose P.1040, which was still hoped to be viable as an RAF fighter. The P.1040 would lead to the eventual development of the land-based swept wing Hawker Hunter fighter. Swept wing versions (P.1052 and P.1081) were built and experience gained with these were instrumental in developing the design of the Hunter.|$|R
5|$|The Combined Chiefs of <b>Staff</b> <b>authorised</b> Morgan {{to issue}} orders {{in the name}} of the Supreme Allied Commander to the Commanders in Chief of the Air, Naval and Land Forces, even though they outranked him. When Montgomery was {{appointed}} Commander in Chief Land Forces for the invasion, in December 1943, he declared that Morgan's original plans were unworkable; they had originally been limited by the availability of landing craft, but Montgomery insisted it would require more men attacking over a wider front. Ultimately, more landing craft were obtained and the invasion was scaled up to Montgomery's satisfaction, at the cost of a month's delay and a reduction in the Southern France operation. However, all the key features of Morgan's plan remained; the choice of Normandy as the assault area, the use of Mulberry harbours, the deployment of American forces on the right and British on the left, the use of airborne troops to cover the flanks, and some form of diversionary operation in Southern France.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of school improvement programmes {{has been investigated}} primarily {{with a focus on}} children’s academic attainments. Research on school improvement programmes acknowledges the importance of stakeholder inclusion in organisational change. The views and experience of school personnel were sought in order to triangulate this information with improvement indicators of school performance. The Solution Oriented Schools (SOS) Programme is a strengths-based school improvement programme which builds on school capacity and inclusive practices. The outcomes of the SOS Programme’s improvement criteria were monitored in 26 schools over one year using a mixed methodology design. Data on improvement indicators such as pupil and staff attendance, fixed-term exclusions and staff turnover was used. Average rates before and after SOS implementation were compared to identify and investigate any improvement in these indicators in line with SOS programme claims. Using a Friedman test, decreases in fixed-term exclusion reached significance. (p< 0. 001). The rate of <b>authorised</b> pupil absences, <b>staff</b> absences and turnover decreased but not significantly and unauthorised pupil absences significantly increased (p< 0. 05). The self-esteem of 316 pupils aged between 4 and 11 was measured using the LAWSEQ scale before and after SOS programme implementation and a significant increase was found (p< 0. 001). Staff self-esteem, measured using the Rosenberg scale also increased significantly (p< 0. 05) and provided a significant indicator of Programme sustainability (p< 0. 05). IV Thematic analysis of seventeen interviews undertaken with staff led to a proposed model of school improvement. This model demonstrated that the extent of the {{effectiveness of}} school improvement programmes rested on the preparation of staff in terms of capacity, perceptions of change and stability of the school before implementation of the programme. Goal Attainment Scales were significantly correlated with fidelity of Programme participation (p< 0. 05). The SOS Programme was useful in enabling schools to achieve these goals. Feedback on the process of change necessary for the success of the SOS programme indicated that there was more to school improvement programmes than simply buying one ‘off the shelf’...|$|R
40|$|E-Leukaemia is a web {{application}} framework that targets the Leukaemia sector which will aid and benefit children suffering from leukaemia. The application has a responsive web design and aims {{to adjust the}} presentation on any mobile devices to allow access to information from anywhere and at any time with an active internet connection. The proposed solution target kids with leukaemia aged 0 - 16 and it will help parents to administrate the treatment as kids can’t take medication unsupervised due to safety precautions. The consequences of incorrectly administering medication can range from minor to life-threating. E-leukaemia is expected to provide the users with various functions such as retrieving patients profile, visibility to weekly treatment and blood tests results, ability to track symptoms when required and create appointments. Medical staff will post patients treatment and lab results on a weekly/monthly basis allowing transparency for the end users on the functions outlined. Administrators can register new accounts only if patients are diagnosed with leukaemia and are attending this hospital. Role based access along with security features will ensure integrity and availability in the system.

40|$|This {{advice is}} aimed at head teachers, school staff and {{governing}} bodies in all schools in England. This advice is intended to explain schools’ powers of screening and searching pupils so that school staff have the confidence to use them. In particular it explains {{the use of the}} power to search pupils without consent. It also explains the powers schools have to seize and then confiscate items found during a search. It includes statutory guidance which schools must have regard to. Key points: Searching  School staff can search a pupil for any item if the pupil agrees 1.  Head teachers and staff authorised by them have a statutory power to search pupils or their possessions, without consent, where they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that the pupil may have a prohibited item. Prohibited items are: o knives or weapons o alcohol o illegal drugs o stolen items o tobacco and cigarette papers o fireworks o pornographic images o any article that the member of staff reasonably suspects has been, or is likely to be, used i) to commit an offence, ii) to cause personal injury to, or damage to the property of, any person (including the pupil) o head teachers and <b>authorised</b> <b>staff</b> can also search for any item banned by the school rules which has been identified in the rules as an item which may be searched for Confiscation  School staff can seize any prohibited item found {{as a result of a}} search. They can also seize any item, however found, which they consider harmful or detrimental to school discipline...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The authors devised an {{experimental}} marking tool using Microsoft Access. Its features were assessed together {{with those of}} commonly available marking software and systems that had been identified by a survey of web and other sources. The marking tools identified, consisting mostly of software designed {{for the needs of}} US High Schools, could be categorised by their features. The categories included the ability to calculate and record marks; provide statistical feedback to staff; provide standard written comments to students; and receive work and/or transmit feedback over a computer network. None of these products had the intuitive feel the authors were seeking, and so we propose a model of an ideal Integrated Marking Tool (IMT). The IMT would allow lecturers to mark work using an electronic pen, replicating their current paper-based approach. It would also provide scores for named assessment categories; calculate marks; provide statistical analysis and provide written feedback to students (collated from an editable bank of comments that would build as the number of similar pieces of work passed through assessment). A full report of the above would be printed or transmitted over a computer network for the student and for the central university system. Issues of plagiarism in written work would also be addressed. The model is extended to cover wider networking potential and appropriateness, including the possible network delivery of elements of the IMT, especially the comments database, and the linkage of recorded results to the student records, where they might be shared with other <b>authorised</b> <b>staff.</b> This paper sets out these criteria, and includes comparisons with commercial examples such as Mindtrail, presenting an opportunity for the delegates to discuss the merits of the IMT model and comment on their own experiences with such products...|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite these}} difficulties, by mid1941 the fledgling {{airborne}} establishment {{was able to}} form the first British airborne unit. This was No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion, which numbered approximately 350 officers and other ranks, and had been formed by converting and retraining No. 2 Commando. On 10 February 1941 thirtyeight men from the battalion conducted the first British airborne operation, Operation Colossus, a raid against an aqueduct in southern Italy; {{it was hoped that}} the destruction of the aqueduct would deprive Italian civilian and military installations of their water supply, damage Italian morale and the Italian war effort in North Africa. The raid was a failure, with {{all but one of the}} airborne troops being captured by Italian military forces, but it did help provide the British airborne establishment with vital lessons for future operations. Shortly after the operation had been conducted, a memorandum was circulated through the War Office by the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Royal Air Force requiring that No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion be expanded into a Parachute Brigade. In July, after a period of discussion about the problems of creating such a formation, the Chief of the Imperial General <b>Staff</b> <b>authorised</b> the raising of a brigade headquarters, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Parachute Battalions and an air troop of sappers from the Royal Engineers. Given the title of 1st Parachute Brigade, volunteers from infantry units were recruited for the new formation from 31 August. Initially commanded by Brigadier Richard Nelson Gale, who was replaced in mid1942 by Brigadier Edwin Flavell, the brigade began an extensive training regime, which included conducting trials and tests of new airborne equipment. On 10 October it was joined by 1 Airlanding Brigade, which had been formed from 31 Independent Brigade Group, a formation recently returned from India. This was shortly followed, on 29 October, by the formation of Headquarters 1st Airborne Division under the command of Brigadier F.A.M. Browning, who would have under his control 1st Parachute Brigade, 1st Airlanding Brigade, and the glider units currently training with the two brigades.|$|R
40|$|This study investigates how {{knowledge}} is transferred in the Nigerian public service, {{the features of}} its bureaucratic culture, as well as, the effects that this culture has on knowledge transfer. The motivation to undertake this study is borne out of the identified gap in the literature, which bothers on the dearth of studies {{in the area of}} knowledge transfer, as well as, the specific features inherent in that of the Nigerian public service bureaucratic culture. Qualitative and quantitative research methods (i. e. semi-structured interviews and survey) are combined in gathering data for this study. Both the interviews and survey sample frames undertaken with key players of the public service covering the three cadres, (senior, and junior and management/directorate staff), were representative of all the aspects of the public service covered. Seven ministries {{out of a total of}} seventeen in the Bayelsa state public service forms the sample frame used for this research The overall empirical results indicate that there is knowledge transfer in the Nigerian public service in view of the available mechanisms used for the transfer of knowledge. In addition, the Nigerian bureaucratic culture has more negative effects than positive on knowledge transfer. The application of Hofstede?s theory reveals a high level of inequality, masculinity and autocracy as features of the Nigerian public service bureaucratic culture. The study also reveals that there is the use of very high sounding military fashion language in the public service, due to the long period of military rule. This research finds that there is reasonable awareness amongst public servants about knowledge and its sources that is needed to run the public service, but that access to knowledge, particularly tacit knowledge by <b>authorised</b> <b>staff</b> is difficult. Public servants agree that certain kind of knowledge transfer activities persist, although the terminology is relatively new to Nigeria. They agree that under the current democratic environment in which the public service operates, government should make concerted efforts to establish a knowledge transfer culture so as to make knowledge readily available. It recommends the entrenchment of a leaning, training and collaborative culture, as well as, the de-emphasising of hierarchy and creation of a more flexible public service. The contribution of this study to {{knowledge is}} in the area of putting in place a framework for the effective implementation of knowledge management practice (transfer) in the Nigerian public service...|$|E
