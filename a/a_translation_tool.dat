50|$|The European Thesaurus on International Relations and Area Studies (abbreviated: European Thesaurus) is a multilingual, {{interdisciplinary}} thesaurus {{covering the}} subject fields of International Relations and Area Studies. The European Thesaurus consists of about 8.200 descriptors organised in 24 subdomains. To enhance {{the access to}} the thesaurus’ controlled vocabulary the descriptors are arranged both alphabetically as well as systematically. The semantic relationships (equivalence, hierarchy, association) between all individual descriptors have been established. The European Thesaurus {{is intended to be}} used primarily in bibliographic databases for indexing and retrieval of professional literature from the relevant domains. The European Thesaurus can, in addition, even serve as a terminological reference work and/or as <b>a</b> <b>translation</b> <b>tool</b> in international affairs matters.|$|E

On the next day, the boy {{from the start of}} the movie {{secretly}} moves into Nobita's room and hides inside the closet. When Gian and Suneo come, Gian fights with him and, due to weakness, the boy faints. On the arrival of Nobita, Shizuka and Doraemon, the group again moves to the past. They take the boy into their cave and when he regains consciousness, Shizuka gives him food. Meanwhile, Doraemon searches with a signal through time and learns that the boy hails from somewhere in present-day Nanjing, China, which has been already inhabited by humans since more than 70,000 years ago. Doraemon further uses <b>a</b> <b>translation</b> <b>tool</b> in order to understand him.

50|$|Ares I-X used {{avionics}} hardware {{from the}} Atlas V Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) to control its flight. This hardware included the Fault Tolerant Inertial Navigation Unit (FTINU) and Redundant Rate Gyro Units (RRGUs), and cable harnesses. The first stage was controlled primarily by heritage hardware from existing Space Shuttle systems. A new electronics box, the Ascent Thrust Vector Controller (ATVC), acted as <b>a</b> <b>translation</b> <b>tool</b> to communicate commands from the Atlas-based flight computer to the solid rocket booster’s {{thrust vector control}} system. The ATVC was the only new avionics box for the flight. All other components were existing or off-the-shelf units. Ares I-X also employed 720 thermal, acceleration, acoustic, and vibration sensors {{as part of its}} developmental flight instrumentation (DFI) to collect the data necessary for the mission. Some of this data was transmitted real-time via telemetry while the rest was stored in electronics boxes located in the First Stage Avionics Module (FSAM), located inside the hollow first-stage fifth segment.|$|E

50|$|The {{prototype}} {{was launched}} on 20 November 2008. At its beta launch, the site gave access to 4.5 million digital objects - {{more than double}} the initial target - from over 1,000 contributing organisations, including world-famous national library, gallery and museum collections from the capitals of Europe. Due to an unexpected user surge (peaking at an estimated 10 million hits an hour), the servers were unable to cope with the massive load. The site was temporarily taken down, and after series of technical upgrades went up again in December 2008.In February 2009, the successor of EDLnet - Europeana version 1.0 - began. This 30-month project was to develop the prototype into a fully operational service. In 2010, the project accomplished its objective of giving access to over 10 million digital objects. Early in 2011, new features on the site included <b>a</b> <b>translation</b> <b>tool</b> and the ability to expand on information by automatically transferring the search term to Wikipedia and other services.|$|E

'World clock II' allows users to view time zones across the world; the graphical user interface highlights the current time zone yellow, and allows users to navigate, left or right, across the world, showing the city at {{the centre of the}} time zone. 'Converter II' is an excellent application for converting anything from currencies, grams, pounds, and so forth. Through the 'Options', users can customise the conversions to suit their needs; this is especially useful when currencies alter in value.

Mucheffort is required to implement <b>a</b> <b>translation</b> <b>tool</b> in conventional programming languages. Maude provides powerful meta-programming facilities that allow us to develop formal translation tools with less effort. In this paper, we present a modular implementation of a translator that is developed in Maude. The translator takes a behavioral specification and produces a rewrite theoryspecification. The implementation of the translator is modular so that multiple translation strategies can be modularized and embedded in the translator. Therefore, multiple styles of rewrite theory specifications can be generated for one behavioral specification. リサーチレポート（北陸先端科学技術大学院大学情報科学研究科...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} model-based systems {{engineering}} framework that couples supervisory control and verification. The framework has a process-theoretic backbone, which supports all required concepts, {{and it is}} implemented using state-of-the-art tools: Supremica for supervisor synthesis and UPPAAL for state-based verification. The process theory relies on partial bisimulation to model controllability and propositional signal emission to model a supervisory control loop with state-based observations. Supremica can model the signal observation by employing finite integer variables and action guards, whereas the supervised system can be consistently translated to UPPAAL by using <b>a</b> <b>translation</b> <b>tool</b> we developed. We illustrate the framework by revisiting an industrial case study of coordinating maintenance procedures of a high-tech Océ printer...|$|E
