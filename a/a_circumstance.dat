5|$|<b>A</b> <b>circumstance</b> {{occurred}} during the action which so strongly marks the invincible spirit of British seamen, when engaging the enemies of their country, that I cannot resist the pleasure I have in making it known to their Lordships; the Temeraire was boarded by accident; or design, by a French ship on one side, and a Spaniard on the other; the contest was vigorous, but, {{in the end the}} combined ensigns were torn from the poop and the British hoisted in their places. Collingwood's account, probably based largely on Harvey's report {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the battle, contained several errors. Temeraire had closely engaged two French ships, rather than a French and a Spanish ship, and had not been boarded by either during the action. Nevertheless, the account was popular and a print was rushed out purporting to show Harvey taking the lead in clearing Temeraires decks of enemy seamen.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{three-quarters of}} all extant strepsirrhine species are nocturnal, {{sleeping}} in nests made from dead leaves or tree hollows during the day. All of the lorisoids from continental Africa and Asia are nocturnal, <b>a</b> <b>circumstance</b> that minimizes their {{competition with the}} simian primates of the region, which are diurnal. The lemurs of Madagascar, living {{in the absence of}} simians, are more variable in their activity cycles. The aye-aye, mouse lemurs, woolly lemurs, and sportive lemurs are nocturnal, while ring-tailed lemurs and most of their kin, sifakas, and indri are diurnal. Yet {{some or all of the}} brown lemurs (Eulemur) are cathemeral, which means that they may be active during the day or night, depending on factors such as temperature and predation. Many extant strepsirrhines are well adapted for nocturnal activity due to their relatively large eyes; large, movable ears; sensitive tactile hairs; strong sense of smell; and the tapetum lucidum behind the retina. Among the adapiforms, most are considered diurnal, with the exception of Pronycticebus and Godinotia from Middle Eocene Europe, both of which had large orbits that suggest nocturnality.|$|E

25|$|After his release, Salisbury {{pursued a}} case in the High Court of Chancery {{concerning}} his wife's marriage portion under her father's will, as only £10,000 of a legacy of £20,000 had been paid.

On 1 May 1691 the Court found in Salisbury's favour and ordered that he should receive a further £10,000, by way of a charge on his wife's sisters' estates.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Peter Diggle and Richard Gratton {{suggested}} using {{a systematic}} simulation scheme to approximate the likelihood function {{in situations where}} its analytic form is intractable. Their method was based on defining a grid in the parameter space and using it to approximate the likelihood by running several simulations for each grid point. The approximation was then improved by applying smoothing techniques to the outcomes of the simulations. While {{the idea of using}} simulation for hypothesis testing was not new, Diggle and Gratton seemingly introduced the first procedure using simulation to do statistical inference under <b>a</b> <b>circumstance</b> where the likelihood is intractable.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} {{to think of the}} advancing wave of depolarisation as a dipole with a head and a tail. The length of the refractory period and the time taken for the dipole to travel a certain distance—the propagation velocity—will determine whether such <b>a</b> <b>circumstance</b> will arise for re-entry to occur. Factors that promote re-entry would include a slow-propagation velocity, a short refractory period with a sufficient size of ring of conduction tissue. These would enable a dipole to reach an area that had been refractory and is now able to be depolarised with continuation of the wavefront.|$|E

25|$|In {{the event}} of a foul being {{committed}} on a player as or after that player succeeds in scoring a try, the scoring team will be awarded a penalty kick in addition to the conversion attempt. In such <b>a</b> <b>circumstance,</b> the conversion attempt is taken in line with where the ball was grounded, followed by a penalty goal attempt taken from {{directly in front of the}} goal posts, regardless of the spot of the foul. Should both kicks be successful, this event is often referred to as an 8-point try. The 8-point try differs from a penalty try, because the attacking player must have successfully scored the try.|$|E
25|$|The {{placement}} delete {{functions are}} called from placement new expressions. In particular, {{they are called}} if the constructor of the object throws an exception. In such <b>a</b> <b>circumstance,</b> {{in order to ensure}} that the program does not incur a memory leak, the placement delete functions are called. A placement new expression first calls the placement operator new function, then calls the constructor of the object upon the raw storage returned from the allocator function. If the constructor throws an exception, it is necessary to deallocate that storage before propagating the exception back to the code that executed the placement new expression, and that is the purpose of the placement delete functions.|$|E
