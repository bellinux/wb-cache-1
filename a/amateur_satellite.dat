25|$|In late January 2008, {{reports from}} {{anonymous}} U.S. officials indicated a U.S. spy satellite, later confirmed as USA-193, {{was in a}} deteriorating orbit and was expected to crash onto Earth within weeks. This {{came as no surprise}} to <b>amateur</b> <b>satellite</b> watchers, who had been predicting the deorbit of the satellite for some time.|$|E
25|$|On 21 March 2016, after a {{lifespan}} {{extended by}} two years, the Space Engineering Office announced that Tiangong-1 had officially ended its service. They {{went on to}} state that the telemetry link with Tiangong-1 had been lost. A couple of months later, <b>amateur</b> <b>satellite</b> trackers watching Tiangong-1 found that China's space agency had {{lost control of the}} station. In September, after conceding they had lost control over the station, officials announced that the station would re-enter and burn up in the atmosphere late in 2017. It is currently expected to deorbit some time between early January and late February 2018.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>amateur</b> <b>satellites</b> do {{not receive}} their {{sequential}} OSCAR designation until after they are successfully in orbit, and then only {{at the request of}} the launching organization. Regardless, <b>amateur</b> <b>satellites</b> will have been named by the organization that constructed it, and that name is frequently prepended to its OSCAR designation, resulting a name such as CubeSat-OSCAR 57. In conversation, names are usually abbreviated as CO-57 or similar.|$|R

50|$|Amateur radio {{operators}} {{have access}} to <b>amateur</b> <b>satellites,</b> which have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne repeaters, and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with UHF or VHF radio equipment and highly directional antennas such as Yagis or dish antennas. Due to launch costs, most current <b>amateur</b> <b>satellites</b> are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with {{only a limited number}} of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the X.25 or similar protocols.|$|R
50|$|Other {{programs}} besides OSCAR {{have included}} Iskra (Soviet Union) circa 1982, JAS-1 (Fuji-OSCAR 12) (Japan) in 1986, RS (Soviet Union and Russia), and CubeSats. (There {{is a list}} of major <b>amateur</b> <b>satellites</b> in Japanese Wikipedia).|$|R

5000|$|The 2-meter band is {{also used}} in {{conjunction}} with the 70-centimeter band, or the 10-meter band and various microwave bands via orbiting <b>amateur</b> radio <b>satellites.</b> This is known as cross band repeating. On-board software defines what mode or band is in use at any particular time and this is determined by amateurs at so-called earth stations who control or instruct the <b>satellite</b> behavior. <b>Amateurs</b> know what mode is in use via published internet schedules. For instance, a favorite mode is Mode [...] "B" [...] or [...] "V/U" [...] which simply indicates the uplink and downlink frequencies or bands the satellite is currently using. In this example, V/U means VHF/UHF or VHF uplink with UHF downlink. Most <b>amateur</b> <b>satellites</b> are Low Earth Orbit satellites, or LEO's as they are affectionately known, and generally are about 450 miles (700 km) high. At that height amateurs can expect reception distances of up to around 3000 mi. However, there are a few <b>amateur</b> <b>satellites</b> that have very high elliptical orbits. These satellites can reach altitudes of 30,000 miles (50,000 km) above the earth where an entire hemisphere is visible providing outstanding communications capabilities from any two points on the earth within line of sight of the satellite; distances that are far {{beyond the reach of the}} LEO's. Satellites are basically orbiting repeaters.|$|R
