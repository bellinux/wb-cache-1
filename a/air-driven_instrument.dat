40|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight tests {{were made to}} {{determine}} the performance characteristics of two designs of commercially available venturi tubes used in airplanes to operate air-driven gyroscopic instruments. Data obtained at sea level {{may be used to}} make approximate predictions of performance at higher altitudes. There is some indication that this may also be done for single venturi tubes. For a given installation in which an <b>air-driven</b> <b>instrument</b> is connected through tubing with a venturi tube, the volume rate of induced air flow is approximately proportional to the product of indicated air speed and the square root of the ratio of standard to ambient air pressure. The efficiency of such a system at a given altitude is constant. Rather large variations in suction and efficiency were found for individual tubes of the same design. Cylindrical fairings on the external surface resulted in a reduction of both drag and suction but little change in efficiency...|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{basis of calculation}} of pressure drop in tubing is reviewed briefly. The effect of pressure drop in connecting tubing upon the operation and indication of aircraft instruments is discussed. Approximate equations are developed, and charts and tables based upon them are presented for use in designing installations of altimeters, air-speed indicators, rate-of-climb indicators, and <b>air-driven</b> gyroscopic <b>instruments...</b>|$|R
30|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is {{a potentially}} serious clinical complication of dental treatments involving forceful injection of air into connective tissue below the dermal layer [1]. Typical incidences are encountered during surgical extraction of teeth, restorative treatment, endodontic treatment, {{and the use}} of air-driven hand pieces [2]. The etiology of subcutaneous emphysema is related to traumatic, iatrogenic, incidental, or pathological events, all of which result from the introduction of gas between the tissue layers [3]. It has been commonly reported that <b>air-driven</b> dental <b>instruments</b> can also cause various degrees of subcutaneous or cervicofacial emphysema.|$|R
