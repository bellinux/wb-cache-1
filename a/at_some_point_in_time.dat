5|$|Neuroblastoma is {{the most}} common cancer in babies and the third most common cancer in {{children}} after leukemia and brain cancer. About 1 in every 7,000 children is affected <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> About 90% of cases occur in children less than 5 years old and it is rare in adults. Of cancer deaths in children about 15% are due to neuroblastoma. The disease was first described in the 1800s.|$|E
5|$|Parts of NY418 {{run through}} a {{proposed}} tourism district known as the First Wilderness Heritage Corridor. The corridor, conceived by Warren County, is intended to revitalize the Hudson River corridor by {{turning it into a}} tourist destination. Areas currently being studied for future development include the primarily residential and agricultural areas around Thurman Station, the privately owned train station along NY418 in this same area, and two vacant lots adjacent to the Hudson River on NY418. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> the entire length of NY418 was included as part of the Dude Ranch Trail, a New York State Scenic Byway that connects Lake George to the Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} main types of {{psoriasis}}: plaque, guttate, inverse, pustular, and erythrodermic. Plaque psoriasis, {{also known as}} psoriasis vulgaris, makes up about 90 percent of cases. It typically presents as red patches with white scales on top. Areas of the body most commonly affected are {{the back of the}} forearms, shins, navel area, and scalp. Guttate psoriasis has drop-shaped lesions. Pustular psoriasis presents as small non-infectious pus-filled blisters. Inverse psoriasis forms red patches in skin folds. Erythrodermic psoriasis occurs when the rash becomes very widespread, and can develop from any of the other types. Fingernails and toenails are affected in most people with psoriasis <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> This may include pits in the nails or changes in nail color.|$|E

5|$|As a term, neo {{soul was}} coined by Kedar Massenburg of Motown Records {{in the late}} 1990s as a {{marketing}} category following the commercial breakthroughs of artists such as D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell. The success of D'Angelo's 1995 debut album Brown Sugar has been regarded by several writers and music critics as inspiration behind the term's origin. While some artists have ignored the label, others have received the designation with controversy because it may seem contrived to music audiences and imply that soul music had ended <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> In a 2002 interview for Billboard, Massenburg said that genre classifications are often unpopular because they may be suggestive of a short-lived trend. However, although he said neo soul is still essentially soul music, Massenburg felt {{there was a need}} to market artists of the genre for listeners to have an understanding of what they were buying.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{analyzing}} the unique cracks lining Europa found evidence showing that it likely spun around a tilted axis <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks {{serves as a}} record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt also could affect the estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis means that more heat is generated by tidal forces. This heat helps the ocean to remain liquid longer. Scientists did not specify when the tilt would have occurred and measurements have not been made of the tilt of Europa's axis.|$|E

25|$|Structural {{analysis}} is mainly concerned with finding out {{the behavior of}} a physical structure when subjected to force. This action can be in the form of load due to the weight of things such as people, furniture, wind, snow, etc. or some other kind of excitation such as an earthquake, shaking of the ground due to a blast nearby, etc. In essence all these loads are dynamic, including the self-weight of the structure because <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> these loads were not there. The distinction is made between the dynamic and the static analysis on the basis of whether the applied action has enough acceleration in comparison to the structure's natural frequency. If a load is applied sufficiently slowly, the inertia forces (Newton's first law of motion) can be ignored and the analysis can be simplified as static analysis.|$|E
