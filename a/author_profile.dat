40|$|The task of {{analyzing}} a text {{of interest in}} order to find demographicinformation of an unknown author based on how the text is written,called <b>author</b> <b>profiling,</b> has become a problem of growing interest. <b>Author</b> <b>profiling</b> can for instance be used in crime investigations togain more information about a possible suspect, which could forexample be a potential violent lone actor that reveals an intentionof committing targeted violence. Machine learning algorithms offers an efficient approach to performauthor profiling. Previous work in <b>author</b> <b>profiling</b> have mostly usedtraditional machine learning algorithms where features are manuallyextracted, which the algorithms base their prediction on. However,in this thesis we compare two different approaches towards authorprofiling, one where the features are manually extracted using thelearning algorithms Support Vector Machine and Feed-Forward NeuralNetworks and one where the features are learned from raw datausing the learning algorithms Convolutional Neural Networks and LongShort-Term Memory. These learning algorithms were used to predictthe gender, age and native language from a text of an unknown author. Also, to get an understanding of how well <b>author</b> <b>profiling</b> works inthe wild, we tested our models on a different domain than they weretrained on. The results showed that in our setting, manually extracted featuresworked better for <b>author</b> <b>profiling.</b> Also, applying learning algorithms toa different domain than they were trained on significantly decreased theperformance.

40|$|<b>Author</b> <b>Profiling</b> is {{the task}} of {{predicting}} characteristics of {{the author of a}} text, such as age, gender, personality, native language, etc. This is a task of growing importance due to the potential applications in security, crime detection and marketing, among others.

40|$|This paper gives a brief {{description}} on the methods adopted for the task of author-profiling {{as part of the}} competition PAN 2016. <b>Author</b> <b>profiling</b> is the task of predicting the author's age and gender from his/her writing. In this paper, we follow a two-level ensemble approach to tackle the cross-genre <b>author</b> <b>profiling</b> task where training documents and testing documents are from different genres. We use the soft-voting approach to build the classification ensemble. To include various feature sets, we first train logistic regression models using the extracted word n-gram, character n-gram, and part-of-speech n-gram features for each genre. We then ensemble single-genre predictive models trained on the blog, social media and Twitter data sources, to build our multi-genre ensemble approach. The experimental results indicate that our approach performs well in both single-genre and cross-genre <b>author</b> <b>profiling</b> tasks. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Author</b> <b>Profiling</b> is {{the task}} of {{predicting}} characteristics of {{the author of a}} text, such as age, gender, personality, native language, etc. This is a task of growing importance due to its potential applications in security, crime and marketing, among others. One of the main difficulties in this field is the lack of reliable text collections (corpora) to train and test automatically derived classifiers, in particular in specific languages such as Spanish. Although some recent data sets were generated for the PAN competitions, these documents have a lot of “noise” that prevent researchers from obtaining more general conclusions about this task when more formal documents are used. In this context, this work proposes and describes SpanText, a data collection of formal texts in Spanish language which is, as far as we know, the first collection with these characteristics for the <b>author</b> <b>profiling</b> task. Besides, an experimental study is carried out where the difference in performance obtained with formal and informal texts is clearly established and opens interesting research lines to get {{a deeper understanding of the}} particularities that each type of documents poses to the <b>author</b> <b>profiling</b> task.

40|$|In {{this work}} we are solving authorship {{attribution}} and <b>author</b> <b>profiling</b> tasks (by {{focusing on the}} age and gender dimensions) for the Lithuanian language. This paper reports the first results on literary texts, which we compared to the results, previously obtained with different functional styles and language types (i. e., parliamentary transcripts and forum posts). Using the Naïve Bayes Multinomial and Support Vector Machine methods we investigated an impact of various stylistic, character, lexical, morpho-syntactic features, and their combinations; the different author set sizes of 3, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 candidate authors; and the dataset sizes of 100, 300, 500, 1, 000, 2, 000, and 5, 000 instances in each class.
