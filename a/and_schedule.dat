5|$|From the outset, {{the team}} {{wanted to make}} a grand RPG, but were {{restricted}} by their budget <b>and</b> <b>schedule.</b> They were reluctant to cut any content such as one of the time periods or the multiplayer aspect, and they decided to postpone the original release date from March 2000 to June the same year. They also scaled back the scope of their multiplayer testing and canceled the planned release of an interactive pre-launch demo. The delay allowed Nihilistic to retain most of the intended design but they were forced to remove the ability to play the entire single-player campaign as a team online, compensating for this by adding two multiplayer scenarios built using levels from the single-player game. Huebner said they did not plan appropriately for multiplayer when building the Java scripts for the single-player game, meaning the scripts did not work effectively in multiplayer mode.|$|E

Although the backpressure framework is conceptually viewed as layered, {{the decisions of}} routing <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> are made jointly, which imposes several challenges in practice. In this work, we present Diff-Max, an approach that separates routing <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> has three strengths: (i) Diff-Max improves throughput significantly, (ii) the separation of routing <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> makes practical implementation easier by minimizing cross-layer operations; i. e., routing is implemented in the network layer <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> is implemented in the link layer, and (iii) the separation of routing <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> leads to modularity; i. e., routing <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> are independent modules in Diff-Max and one can continue to operate even if the other does not. Our approach is grounded in a network utility maximization (NUM) formulation {{of the problem and}} its solution.

5|$|Challenges for the {{localization}} teams include space limitation (due to {{data storage}} and/or on-screen space), achieving a natural dialogue flow despite multiple plot branches and script lines being stored out of order, and, when voiced footage is not re-recorded for lip movement, dealing with file length and lip-synch limitations. When {{the same team}} works on different games in a series such as Final Fantasy, they often need to adopt different writing styles depending on the setting of their games. Another point to consider is humorous elements that do not translate properly into English, and different cultural expectations about character interactions. The localization process depends on {{factors such as the}} development teams' wishes, as well as budget <b>and</b> <b>schedule.</b> Traditionally, translation usually started late in development or after the original Japanese release, but recent titles have been translated during initial development, making the translators appear more like additional planners or consultants and not just translators-this was the case for Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XIV and Final Fantasy XV. A few titles, like The Bouncer, have actually been recorded in English first and then adapted to Japanese. The Last Remnant also adopted this approach, featuring motion-capture and dialogue synched to English rather than Japanese actors. This was done due to the company's wish to create a title for the international market.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. 1 The {{conventional}} wisdom and practice is that planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> tasks are solved separately using different methods and approaches. However, recent development in industrial planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> demands for mixing both tasks to allow modelling of wider class of problems. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to present a framework for mixing planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> tasks within single system. We analyse traditional views of planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> we highlight the drawbacks of separating both tasks when applied to modelling complex process environments. We give some real-life examples where the mixed approach helps to model the problems and we propose a generic framework for such mixture. We also argue for using constraint programming as underlying solving technology and, finally, we describe some constraint models based on the proposed framework. Although, we concentrate on planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> in complex process environments we believe that the results contribute to both planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> communities in general. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> attracts an unceasing {{attention}} of computer science community. However, despite of similar character of both tasks, in most current systems planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> problems are solved independently using different methods. Recent development of Constraint Programming brings a new breeze to these areas. It allows {{using the same}} techniques for modelling planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> problems as well as exploiting successful methods developed in Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research. In the paper we analyse the problems behind planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> in complex process environments and we propose to enhance the traditional schedulers by planning capabilities to solve these problems. We argue for using dynamic models to capture such mixed planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> environment. Despite of studying the proposed framework using the complex process environment background {{we believe that the}} results are applicable in general to other (nonproduction) problem areas where mixed planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> capabilities are desirable. ...|$|R
