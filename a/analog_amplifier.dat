2500|$|The first {{thyristor}} {{devices were}} released commercially in 1956. Because thyristors can control {{a relatively large}} amount of power and voltage with a small device, they find wide application in control of electric power, ranging from light dimmers and electric motor speed control to high-voltage direct current power transmission.

[...] The latter is known as a gate turn-off thyristor, or GTO thyristor. [...] A thyristor is not a proportional device like a transistor. In other words, a thyristor can only be fully on or off, while a transistor can lie in between on and off states.

50|$|Modern {{speakers}} {{marketed as}} 'digital' are always analog speakers, {{in most cases}} driven by an <b>analog</b> <b>amplifier.</b> The widespread {{use of the term}} 'digital' with speakers is a marketing ploy intended to claim better suitability with 'digital' source material (e.g., MP3 recordings), or impute 'higher technology' than some other speaker, and perhaps higher price. If pressed, manufacturers may claim the term means the product is 'ready' for input from digital players; this is true of essentially all speaker systems.|$|E
50|$|While {{originally}} designed to handle logic-level digital signals, a TTL inverter can be biased as an <b>analog</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Connecting a resistor between the output and the input biases the TTL element as a negative feedback amplifier. Such amplifiers {{may be useful to}} convert analog signals to the digital domain but would not ordinarily be used where analog amplification is the primary purpose. TTL inverters can also be used in crystal oscillators where their analog amplification ability is significant.|$|E
50|$|After {{the success}} of the Resound Corporation, other hearing aid {{companies}} began putting out hybrid hearing aids that included <b>analog</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> filters, and limiters that were managed digitally.

In <b>analog</b> <b>amplifiers</b> this curtailment of frequency response {{is a major}} implication of the Miller effect. In this example, the frequency ω3dB such that ω3dB CMRA = 1 {{marks the end of}} the low-frequency response region and sets the bandwidth or cutoff frequency of the amplifier.|$|R
50|$|An analog {{front-end}} (AFE or {{analog front-end}} controller AFEC) {{is a set}} of analog signal conditioning circuitry that uses sensitive <b>analog</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> often operational amplifiers, filters, and sometimes application-specific integrated circuits for sensors, radio receivers, and other circuits to provide a configurable and flexible electronics functional block, needed to interface a variety of sensors to an, antenna, analog to digital converter or in some cases to a microcontroller.|$|R
50|$|The major {{advantage}} of a class-D amplifier {{is that it can}} be more efficient than an <b>analog</b> <b>amplifier,</b> with less power dissipated as heat in the active devices. Given that large heat sinks are not required, Class-D amplifiers are much lighter weight than analog amplifiers, an important consideration with portable sound reinforcement system equipment and bass amplifiers. Output stages such as those used in pulse generators are examples of class-D amplifiers. However, the term mostly applies to power amplifiers intended to reproduce audio signals with a bandwidth well below the switching frequency.|$|E
50|$|A TTL gate may operate {{inadvertently}} as an <b>analog</b> <b>amplifier</b> if {{the input}} {{is connected to}} a slowly changing input signal that traverses the unspecified region from 0.8 V to 2 V. The output can be erratic when the input is in this range. A slowly changing input like this can also cause excess power dissipation in the output circuit. If such an analog input must be used, there are specialized TTL parts with Schmitt trigger inputs available that will reliably convert the analog input to a digital value, effectively operating as a one bit A to D converter.|$|E

A method to model high-gain feedback-loop <b>analog</b> <b>amplifiers</b> on an event driven time axis is presented. The demonstrator is coded in digital VHDL’ 93. In the event-driven scheme any node in the network must converge „on its own “ {{based on the information}} delivered from its neighbors, as no overall matrix is set up. For this reason signal loops with a loop gain larger than one are typically unstable. This communication presents a numerically stable generic model for high gain amplifiers with a user defined feedback network. Non-ideal effects like offset or finite gain can be taken into account. ...|$|R
50|$|However, when wider {{bands are}} needed, for {{instance}} {{a very high}} (action potentials) or a low frequency (local field potentials), they could be filtered digitally, perhaps with second-stage <b>analog</b> <b>amplifier</b> before being digitized. There may be some drawbacks when several amplifiers in cascade. It depends on the type, analog or digital. However, in general, filters cause time-delay and amendments are needed to have signals in sync. Also, as extra complexity is added, it costs more money. In terms of digital amplifiers, a lot of works that the laboratories do are feeding back signals to the networks in closed loop, real-time. As a result, more time is needed to apply on signals when there are more digital amplifiers on the way. One solution is using field-programmable gate array (FPGA), the “blank slate” integrated circuit that is written whatever on it. Using FPGA sometimes reduces a need to use computers, resulting in a speed-up of filtering. Another problem with cascaded filters occurs when the maximum output of the first filter is smaller than the raw signals, and the second filter has a higher maximum output that the first filter. In that case, {{it is impossible to}} recognize if the signals have reached the maximum output or not.|$|E
