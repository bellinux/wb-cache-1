5|$|The {{extent of}} Rommel's {{involvement}} in the military's resistance against Hitler or the 20 July plot is difficult to ascertain, as people most directly involved did not survive, and limited documentation of the conspirators' plans and preparations exists. Thus, Rommel's participation remains ambiguous, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> it largely has its source in subsequent events, (especially Rommel's forced suicide), and the post-war accounts by surviving participants.|$|E
5|$|A new Prisons Act {{was passed}} in 1981, which updated the 1903 act and its eleven {{amendments}} with modern philosophies and practices – codifying departmental orders, instructions, and policy documents. The act was, however, slanted towards prisoner management and safety, as the government and opposition were mindful of public opinion, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> lax security at Fremantle. The result was legislation criticised by the Criminal Lawyers Association, academics, and newspapers, including for minimal welfare provisions that did little to ensure prisoner welfare. The department was {{at the same time}} renamed the Prisons Department once more, to emphasise imprisonment as its primary responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the bird's size.|$|E

Data were collected from 718 parents and 111 teachers by means of a written survey— School Effectiveness Questionnaire published by The Psychological Corporation (Baldwin, et al., 1998). Three research questions were answered by testing 21 hypotheses. Mean scores, paired-sample t-test, Multiple Analysis of Variances (MANOVA) and descriptive comparative statistics were used. Based on the statistical treatment, the following conclusions appear warranted: (1) Significant differences existed in <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> parents in high-performing schools <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> parents in low-performing schools with respect to clear and focused mission.

5|$|One colonist at Wessagusset, {{seeing these}} signs and other {{indications}} of hostility, fled to Plymouth to bring word of an imminent attack. Adding to his desperation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> imminent hostility, he was pursued by natives during his flight. Arriving at Plymouth on March 24, {{he met with}} the Governor and town council. It is unclear whether this colonist's report was the tipping point, or whether Plymouth had already decided to mount a preemptive attack. Plymouth's Edward Winslow had recently been warned by Massasoit, a sachem whose life he saved using English medicine, of a conspiracy of several tribes against Wessagusset and Plymouth. The threatening tribes, he was told, were led by the Massachusett but also included the Nauset, Paomet, Succonet, Mattachiest, Agowaywam, and Capawack tribes {{from as far away as}} Martha's Vineyard. In either case, Plymouth colony sent a small force under Miles Standish to Wessagusset. They arrived there on March 26.|$|E

25|$|Kramer {{witnessed}} {{the spread of}} the disease later known as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) among his friends in 1980. He co-founded the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC), which has become the world's largest private organization assisting people living with AIDS. Kramer grew frustrated with bureaucratic paralysis and the apathy of gay men to the AIDS crisis, and wished to engage in further action than the social services GMHC provided. He expressed his frustration by writing a play titled The Normal Heart, produced at The Public Theater in New York City in 1985. His political activism continued with the founding of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) in 1987, an influential direct action protest organization with the aim of gaining more public action to fight the AIDS crisis. ACT UP has been widely credited with changing public health policy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> people living with AIDS (PWAs), and with raising awareness of HIV and AIDS-related diseases.

25|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War forced Turkish {{leaders to}} {{reassess}} their country's international position. The disappearance of the Soviet threat <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> being excluded from Europe have created a sense of vulnerability with respect to Turkey's position in the fast-changing global political environment. Özal believed Turkey's future security depended on the continuation of a strong relationship with the United States. For that reason, he supported the United States' position during the Persian Gulf War, although Turkey's economic ties to Iraq were extensive and their disruption hurt the country. After the war, he continued to support major United States initiatives in the region, including {{the creation of a}} no-fly zone over northern Iraq, the Arab–Israeli peace process, and expanded ties with the Central Asian members of the CIS. Özal's pro-United States policy was not accepted by all Turks. The United States' use of Turkish military installations during the bombing of Iraq in 1991 led to antiwar demonstrations in several cities, and sporadic attacks on United States facilities continued in 1992 and 1993. Nevertheless, among Turkey's political elite, a consensus had emerged by January 1995 that Turkey's security depended on remaining a strategic ally of the United States. For that reason, both the Demirel and Çiller governments undertook efforts to cultivate relations with the administrations of presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} focuses on the {{relationship}} among the Dark Triad (psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism), <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> organizational politics, political skills, and counterproductive work behavior.

Moreover, the results identify the moderating role of political skills in strengthening the link between <b>the</b> Dark Triad <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> organizational politics.
