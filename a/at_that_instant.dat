25|$|Conventional bombsights {{are set up}} {{pointing}} at a fixed angle, the range angle, which accounts for the various effects on the trajectory of the bomb. To the operator looking through the sights, the crosshairs indicate the location on the ground the bombs would impact if released <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant.</b> As the aircraft moves forward, the target approaches the crosshairs from the front, moving rearward, and the bombardier releases the bombs as the target passes through {{the line of the}} sights. One example of a highly automated system of this type was the RAF's Mark XIV bomb sight.|$|E
25|$|The {{system worked}} by having two dipole antennas instead of one, {{slightly}} offset {{on either side}} of the mounting mast projecting through the middle of the parabolic dish. Being offset, the beams produced by the two dipoles were angled away from each other, to either side of the dish centreline. Normally the signals from both were added together and displayed, producing an output largely identical to the single-dipole case. The dipole shaft was mounted on another motor that rapidly spun them at 800rpm. A switch was placed so that it was triggered by the motor when the dipoles were roughly vertical or roughly horizontal, triggering a second circuit that subtracted the signals from each other instead of adding. The result was the difference in signal strength, which indicated which of the two dipoles was receiving more energy <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant.</b> This signal was fed into the scanner motors, driving it in the right direction.|$|E
25|$|On 9 April 1799, after reconnoitering two French frigates in L'Orient, St Fiorenzo and HMS Amelia sailed towards Belle Île. Conditions were hazy and {{although}} Neale had sighted some vessels, {{it was only}} when he had passed the island that he discovered three French frigates and a large gun vessel. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> a sudden squall carried away Amelias main-top-mast and fore and mizzen top-gallant masts; the fall of the main-top-mast tore away much of the mainsail from the yard. Neale shortened St Fiorenzos sail and ordered Amelia to keep close to St Fiorenzo to maintain the weather gage, and to prepare for battle. An action commenced but the French vessels avoided close-quarter action and, although the British ships came under fire from shore batteries, they had to bear down on the French three times to engage them. After nearly two hours the French wore ship and sailed away to take refuge in the Loire, with the gun-vessel returning to Belle Île.|$|E

25|$|The team first {{considered}} {{spinning the}} radar dish around a vertical axis and then angling the dish {{up and down}} a few degrees with each complete circuit. The vertical motion could be smoothed out by moving continually rather than in steps, producing a helix pattern. However, this helical-scan solution had two disadvantages; one was that the dish spent half of its time pointed backwards, limiting the amount of energy broadcast forward, and the other was that it required the microwave energy to somehow be sent to the antenna through a rotating feed. At a 25 October all-hands meeting attended by Dee, Hodgkin and members of the GEC group at GEC's labs, {{the decision was made to}} proceed with the helical-scan solution in spite of these issues. GEC solved the problem of having the signal turned off half the time by using two dishes mounted back-to-back and switching the output of the magnetron to the one facing forward <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant.</b> They initially suggested that the system would be available by December 1940, but as work progressed it became clear that it would take much longer.|$|E
500|$|Shelley's first travel {{narrative}} and first published work, History of a Six Weeks' Tour, was published anonymously and was co-written with her husband. Rambles, {{on the other}} hand, places Mary Shelley at {{the centre of the}} narrative. It tells the story of [...] "the recovery of paradise" [...] and the fears of a mother. Her maternal sorrow is generalised. For example, in discussing the death of her daughter in 1818, she writes: [...] "I was agitated again by emotions—by passions—and those the deepest a woman's heart can harbour—a dread to see her child even <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> expire—which then occupied me". Connecting these deep feelings to writings by Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Thomas Holcroft, she argues that intense emotion and environment are intertwined, contending that maternal grief is sublime.|$|E
500|$|Another {{well-known}} {{story is}} that the actors did not know until {{the last day of}} shooting how the film was to end. The original play (set entirely in the cafe) ended with Rick sending Ilsa and Laszlo to the airport. During scriptwriting, the possibility was discussed of Laszlo being killed in Casablanca, allowing Rick and Ilsa to leave together, but as Casey Robinson wrote to Hal Wallis before filming began, the ending of the film [...] "set up for a swell twist when Rick sends her away on the plane with Laszlo. For now, in doing so, he is not just solving a love triangle. He is forcing the girl {{to live up to the}} idealism of her nature, forcing her to carry on with the work that in these days is far more important than the love of two little people." [...] It was certainly impossible for Ilsa to leave Laszlo for Rick, as the production code forbade showing a woman leaving her husband for another man. The concern was not whether Ilsa would leave with Laszlo, but how this result could be engineered. The problem was solved when the Epstein brothers, Julius and Philip, were driving down Sunset Boulevard and stopped for the light at Beverly Glen. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> the identical twins turned to each other and simultaneously cried out, [...] "Round up the usual suspects!" [...] By the time they had driven past Fairfax and the Cahuenga Pass and through the Warner Brothers studio's portals at Burbank, in the words of Julius Epstein, [...] "the idea for the farewell scene between a tearful Bergman and a suddenly noble Bogart" [...] had been formed and all the problems of the ending had been solved. The confusion was probably caused by Bergman's later statement that she did not know which man she was meant to be in love with. Rewrites did occur during the filming, but Aljean Harmetz's examination of the scripts has shown that many of the key scenes were shot after Bergman knew how the film would end; any confusion was, in critic Roger Ebert's words, [...] "emotional", not [...] "factual".|$|E

50|$|When the {{electromagnetic}} energy from a sferic escapes the Earth-ionosphere waveguide {{and enters the}} magnetosphere, it becomes dispersed by the near-earth plasma, forming a whistler signal.

[...] When either the reference or signal has a positive edge, the corresponding flip-flop switches high. [...] Once both reference and signal is high, both flip-flops are reset. [...] Which flip-flop is high determines <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> whether the reference or signal leads the other. [...] The error signal {{is the difference between}} these two flip-flop values. [...] The pole-zero filter is implemented by adding the error signal and its derivative to the filtered error signal.

2500|$|During the springtime when mating is observable, {{adults are}} {{commonly}} found paired with the males {{mounted on the}} females. This position will be maintained for periods of time even though copulation may not be occurring <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant.</b> Typically, males will firmly take hold of the female’s antennae with their mandibles in order to position themselves for sexual activity. Once copulation is achieved the male will release the female’s antenna and begin to slide backward onto the female’s elytra. He will then begin to use his antennae to stroke the pronotum of the female. Again the male searches for and grabs the female’s antennae and this series of events is repeated. This activity will occur frequently until the female oviposits. [...] Males have not been seen to be sexually active when the eggs and/or instar larvae are present at the carcass. This behavior suggests that the males might use this time to insure paternity of the offspring of the particular female with which he mated.|$|E
2500|$|In 1682, {{the minutes}} of the Royal Society in London Robert Hooke noted Thomas Digges' 1571 Pantometria, (a book on measurement, {{partially}} based on his father Leonard Digges' notes and observations) seemed to support an English claim to {{the invention of the}} telescope, describing Leonard as having a fare seeing glass in the mid 1500s based on an idea by Roger Bacon. Thomas described it as [...] "by proportional Glasses duly situate in convenient angles, not only discovered things far off, read letters, numbered pieces of money with the very coin and superscription thereof, cast by some of his friends of purpose upon downs in open fields, but also seven miles off declared what hath been done <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> in private places." [...] Comments on the use of proportional or [...] "perspective glass" [...] are also made in the writings of John Dee (1575) and [...] William Bourne (1585). Bourne was asked in 1580 to investigate the Diggs device by Queen Elizabeth I's chief advisor Lord Burghley. Bourne's is the best description of it, and from his writing it seemed to consist of peering into a large curved mirror that reflected the image produced by a large lens. The idea of an [...] "Elizabethan Telescope" [...] has been expanded over the years, including astronomer and historian Colin Ronan 1990s explorations concluding this reflecting/refracting telescope was built by Leonard Digges between 1540 and 1559. This [...] "backwards" [...] reflecting telescope would have been unwieldy, it needed very large mirrors and lens to work, the observer had to stand backwards to look at an upside down view, and Bourne noted it had a very narrow field of view making it unsuitable for military purposes.
