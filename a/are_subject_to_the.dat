5000|$|A stranger's ratings about a {{participant}} are more correspondent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> participant's self-assessment ratings when <b>the</b> stranger has <b>been</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> participant's {{thoughts and feelings}} than when <b>the</b> stranger has <b>been</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> participant's behavior alone, {{or a combination of}} the two.|$|R
5|$|The note further elaborates {{that unlike}} {{the rest of}} the EU, where most guns are owned for hunting, the vast {{majority}} of Czech gun owners possess firearms suitable for protection of life, health and property, explicitly mentioning, inter alia, semi-automatic rifles (which <b>are</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proposed EU Gun Ban, see above).|$|E
5|$|Because {{judicial}} decisions <b>are</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sometimes arbitrary {{assessments of the}} CCP, citizens who attempt {{to make use of}} the legal system to pursue grievances find that, if their cause is determined to have the potential to undermine the authority of the Communist Party, they may be suppressed. Defendants who find themselves facing criminal charges, such as for conducting activism or for their religious beliefs, often have few means of pursuing an effective defense.|$|E
5|$|Note: While {{the general}} plot of Invisible War follows a {{distinct}} path, many {{elements such as}} faction alliances and character interactions <b>are</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> player's decisions. The game also offers several subplots and explanations which the player {{may or may not}} encounter, depending on their actions within the game. This synopsis concentrates on the main, unavoidable plot thread of the game.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} the Spanish arrived Tzapopan was a fairly large settlement, {{but it was in}} decline due to wars with various {{surrounding}} nomadic tribes. It <b>was</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dominion of Atemajac, also called Tlatoanazgo, which itself <b>was</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hueytlatoanazgo of Tonalá.|$|R
50|$|The {{environment}} objective has seen limited policy initiatives in the past. All major energy development projects <b>are</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mandatory {{environmental impact assessment}} requirement. Environmental consequences, such as emissions, discharges and noise <b>are</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> environmental quality standards like air quality and emission standards.|$|R

5|$|The United States also observes tribal {{sovereignty}} of the American Indian nations to a limited degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands <b>are</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states {{they have a great}} deal of autonomy, but also like the states, tribes are not allowed to make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.|$|E
5|$|The budget also {{included}} changes to {{products and services}} that <b>are</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sales tax, effective October 1, 2006. The newly taxable items included downloaded music, ringtones, movies and books; shipping and handling; drapery and carpet dry cleaning; floor installation; contracted landscaping; self-storage; tanning; massages; tattooing; magazines; investigation and security services such as armored cars and alarm systems; limousines, except for those used in funerals; memberships in health, athletic and shopping clubs; and parking, except for employee parking, parking at municipal meters and parking already subject to municipal parking taxes.|$|E
5|$|Regarding the {{taxability}} {{of income}} {{in connection with}} events or activities not involving a government privilege or franchise, the United States Supreme Court stated in United States v. Sullivan that gains from illegal traffic in liquor <b>are</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Federal income tax. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Rutkin v. United States that the receipt of money obtained by extortion is taxable as income to the wrongdoer. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in James v. United States that the receipt of money obtained through embezzlement is taxable as income to the wrongdoer, even though the wrongdoer is required to return the money to its owner.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{distinction}} between a redshift in cosmological context as compared to that witnessed when nearby objects exhibit a local Doppler-effect redshift. Rather than cosmological redshifts being {{a consequence of the}} relative velocities that <b>are</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> laws of special relativity (and thus subject to the rule that no two locally separated objects can have relative velocities with respect to each other faster than the speed of light), the photons instead increase in wavelength and redshift because of a global feature of the spacetime metric through which they are traveling. One interpretation of this effect is the idea that space itself is expanding. Due to the expansion increasing as distances increase, the distance between two remote galaxies can increase at more than 3 m/s, but this does not imply that the galaxies move faster than the speed of light at their present location (which is forbidden by Lorentz covariance).|$|E
5|$|Thirty-nine Native American tribal {{governments are}} based in Oklahoma, each holding limited powers within {{designated}} areas. While Indian reservations typical {{in most of the}} United States are not present in Oklahoma, tribal governments hold land granted during the Indian Territory era, but with limited jurisdiction and no control over state governing bodies such as municipalities and counties. Tribal governments are recognized by the United States as quasi-sovereign entities with executive, judicial, and legislative powers over tribal members and functions, but <b>are</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> authority of the United States Congress to revoke or withhold certain powers. The tribal governments are required to submit a constitution and any subsequent amendments to the United States Congress for approval.|$|E
