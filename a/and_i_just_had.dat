He {{went on to}} wear jersey number 18 for both Toronto and Cleveland, explaining that: [...] "I played in Israel before I {{came back to the}} NBA, and I had such a great time... two of my sons were born while I was playing overseas and one was actually born in Israel. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> such a great experience that I wanted to take something from that experience. The number 18, in Judaism, it means 'chai'... and it's the symbol for life and good fortune in Judaism.

500|$|Explaining that {{he wrote}} it as per his whim, and not {{according}} {{to the need to}} have more philosophy or love or war, Tripathi was sure that The Oath of the Vayuputras would have a tragic ending. During an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Tripathi explained that he had purposefully used the modern terms for the different historical locations described in the book, including calling India by its name, rather than its ancient name, Jambudweep. He did not believe that India could be represented as a political concept in his book, since at the timeline followed in the Shiva trilogy, India was still a cultural concept. Since some of the characters have their mythological names, but do not follow the characteristic traits, Tripathi believed that such development was spontaneous and did not question his writing further. Giving an example, the author said: [...] "When I was writing the first book, I was struggling with the Naga, because I wanted to desperately change his character – that he should be jovial and happy. But he kept ending up as a tormented and troubled a guy who was suffering. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to surrender" ...|$|E

500|$|In early 2008 {{during an}} {{interview}} with the Daily Mail, Lister expressed her feelings on the subject of lesbian storylines, stating: [...] "I'd definitely do a lesbian love scene in Hollyoaks. That would be a really good story." [...] It was later confirmed by Channel 4 that Lister's character would be involved in a sexual relationship with Sarah during the new late night series Hollyoaks Later. After the screening of the scenes, Lister explained: [...] "It was quite nerve-wracking actually as I'm good friends with Loui — it's quite a strange thing to smooch a really good friend so we had to get over the giggles and think 'right, just do it!'" [...] Also commenting on her worries about the scenes, she said: [...] "I thought it was hilarious! I thought it'd be interesting, though. I was obviously quite worried about them. Loui [...] and I chatted a lot when we found out {{that it was going to}} be in the late-night eps and we were wondering 'oh no, what does this mean?!' But in the end, they weren't graphic or anything like that, so it was fine." [...] She continued: [...] "It was completely mental filming them. Loui <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> a massive attack of the giggles. I think the crew were more embarrassed than we were! We were kind of ignored for the day." ...|$|E
500|$|Julian Jarrold became {{attached}} {{to direct the}} film in early 2005. It was his second feature film, after Kinky Boots, which was released later that year. According to Bernstein, he [...] "liked [...] style as it was modern and visceral, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> a {{feeling that he was}} the right choice. This piece needed to be handed with delicacy but also {{with a certain amount of}} brio and Julian was able to bring those two things to the production." [...] The director began work on the project in early 2006, rereading the novels Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Persuasion and also reviewing Austen biographies such as Spence's book. Jarrold depended most heavily on the script, calling it [...] "a rich, witty and clever screenplay from someone who obviously knew his subject very well. It is a love story but much more besides. Kevin's screenplay has so many layers and interesting ideas. Apart from the love story I was very attracted by the themes of imagination and experience." [...] The director intended to [...] "bring Austen up to date by roughening her up a bit" [...] and adding [...] "more life and energy and fun," [...] opining that past Austen adaptations had been [...] "a little bit picture-postcard and safe and sweet and nice." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the subject}} of his religion, Hawke {{previously}} wrote, while attending the 1952 World Christian Youth Conference in India, that [...] "there were all these poverty stricken kids at the gate of this palatial place where we were feeding our face <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> this struck by this enormous sense of irrelevance of religion to the needs of people". He subsequently abandoned his Christian beliefs. By the time he entered politics he was a self-described agnostic. Hawke told Andrew Denton in 2008 that his father's Christian faith had continued to influence his outlook, saying [...] "My father said if you believe in the fatherhood of God you must necessarily believe in the brotherhood of man, it follows necessarily, and even though I left the church and was not religious, that truth remained with me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Piper starred as Hannah Baxter in Secret Diary of a Call Girl, an ITV2 {{adaptation}} of Brooke Magnanti's The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl, a memoir detailing {{the life of}} a high-class prostitute who adopted [...] "Belle de Jour" [...] as her pseudonym, which aired from September 2007. As part of her preparation for the role, Piper met the memoir's author two years before her identity as a research scientist was revealed in a Sunday newspaper: [...] "I absolutely had to meet the person behind the words {{to be able to take}} the part... people did ask me about her <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to smile, to avoid giving anything away." [...] A second season, with Piper again in the starring role, started filming in May 2008, during which two body doubles were hired to hide Piper's pregnancy during the sex scenes. The third season began airing in January 2010. For the third and fourth series Piper was credited as executive producer.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't think I {{was crying}} because I was really so {{very fond of}} him," [...] {{reflected}} Anne. [...] "I just cried because all the others did. It was Ruby Gillis started it. Ruby Gillis has always declared she hated Mr. Phillips, but {{just as soon as}} he got up to make his farewell speech she burst into tears. Then all the girls began to cry, one after the other. I tried to hold out, Marilla. I tried to remember the time Mr. Phillips made me sit with Gil--with a, boy; and the time he spelled my name without an e on the blackboard; and how he said I was the worst dunce he ever saw at geometry and laughed at my spelling; and all the times he had been so horrid and sarcastic; but somehow I couldn't, Marilla, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to cry too. Jane Andrews has been talking for a month about how glad she'd be when Mr. Phillips went away and she declared she'd never shed a tear. Well, she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a handkerchief from her brother--of course the boys didn't cry--because she hadn't brought one of her own, not expecting to need it. Oh, Marilla, it was heartrending. Mr. Phillips made such a beautiful farewell speech beginning, 'The time has come for us to part.' It was very affecting. And he had tears in his eyes too, Marilla. Oh, I felt dreadfully sorry and remorseful for all the times I'd talked in school and drawn pictures of him on my slate and made fun of him and Prissy. I can tell you I wished I'd been a model pupil like Minnie Andrews. She hadn't anything on her conscience. The girls cried all the way home from school. Carrie Sloane kept saying every few minutes, 'The time has come for us to part,' and that would start us off again whenever we were in any danger of cheering up. I do feel dreadfully sad, Marilla. But one can't feel quite in the depths of despair with two months' vacation before them, can they, Marilla? And besides, we met the new minister and his wife coming from the station. For all I was feeling so bad about Mr. Phillips going away I couldn't help taking a little interest in a new minister, could I? His wife is very pretty. Not exactly regally lovely, of course--it wouldn't do, I suppose, for a minister to have a regally lovely wife, because it might set a bad example. Mrs. Lynde says the minister's wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she dresses so fashionably. Our new minister's wife was dressed in blue muslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses. Jane Andrews said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for a minister's wife, but I didn't make any such uncharitable remark, Marilla, because I know what it is to long for puffed sleeves. Besides, she's only been a minister's wife for a little while, so one should make allowances, shouldn't they? They are going to board with Mrs. Lynde until the manse is ready." ...|$|E
