5|$|In 1961, Fischer {{started a}} 16-game match with Reshevsky, split between New York and Los Angeles. Reshevsky, 32 years Fischer's senior, was {{considered}} the favorite, since he had far more match experience and had never lost a set match. After 11 games <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tie</b> score (two wins apiece with seven draws), the match ended prematurely due to a scheduling dispute between Fischer and match organizer and sponsor Jacqueline Piatigorsky. Reshevsky was declared the winner, by default, and received the winner's share of the prize fund.|$|E
5|$|The NHL became first {{involved}} in international {{play in the}} mid-1970s, starting with the Summit Series in 1972 which pitted the top Canadian players of the NHL against the top players in the Soviet Union. With the eight-game series tied at three wins apiece <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tie,</b> Paul Henderson scooped up a rebound and put it past Soviet goaltender Vladislav Tretiak with 34 {{seconds left in the}} eighth and final game to score the series-winning goal.|$|E
5|$|Kiprusoff {{was offered}} {{a spot on the}} Finnish team for the 2002 Winter Olympics, but {{declined}} citing a desire to focus on his professional career in North America. Kiprusoff was named the starting goaltender for the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, and earned a shutout against the Czech Republic. He posted four wins <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tie,</b> including a second shutout, and a 1.18 GAA to lead the upstart Finns into the championship game against Canada. In spite of his 30 saves, the Finns were defeated by Canada 3–2. Kiprusoff did not play his best game in the final, according to Finland Head Coach Raimo Summanen, though he expressed pride in his team's effort.|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma {{was led by}} seventh-year {{head coach}} Bud Wilkinson. He had assumed the {{position}} himself after Tatum resigned to leave for Maryland. The two had also both served as assistant coaches in the U.S. Navy for the Iowa Pre-Flight football team under Don Faurot. Faurot had pioneered the split-T offense that both Tatum and Wilkinsons' teams employed. Since taking over at Oklahoma, Wilkinson had achieved a 62–8–3record. Oklahoma entered the game on an eight-game winning streak with a single loss in the season-opener to Notre Dame <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tie</b> in Week 2 against Pittsburgh. Oklahoma also had an injured quarterback, second-stringer Pat O'Neal had separated his sternum at Miami and would miss the game.|$|E
5|$|The Original Six era {{ended in}} 1967 when the NHL {{doubled in size}} by adding six new {{expansion}} teams. The six existing teams were formed into the newly created East Division, while the expansion teams were formed into the West Division. The NHL continued to expand, adding another six teams, to total 18 by 1974. This continued expansion was partially {{brought about by the}} NHL's attempts to compete with the World Hockey Association, which operated from 1972 until 1979 and sought to compete with the NHL for markets and players. Bobby Hull was the most famous player to defect to the rival league, signing a $2.75 million contract with the Winnipeg Jets. The NHL became involved in international play in the mid-1970s, starting with the Summit Series in 1972 which pitted the top Canadian players of the NHL against the top players in the Soviet Union, which was won by Canada with four wins, three losses, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tie.</b> Eventually, Soviet-Bloc players streamed into the NHL with the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989.|$|E
5|$|This {{discrepancy}} is {{also caused}} by ties. In men's artistic gymnastics, a three-way tie {{for the gold}} medal in the horizontal bar meant that no silver and bronze medals were awarded; in the pommel horse, rings and parallel bars ties for first positions resulted in two golds per event, and thus no silvers were awarded; <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tie</b> for silver in the individual all-around resulted in no bronze being awarded. In women's artistic gymnastics, ties for {{the gold medal in}} the uneven bars and floor meant that no silvers were awarded for those events. In athletics, a three-way tie in the men's high jump, and ties in the men's 3,000m steeplechase and the women's high jump for second place meant that no bronzes were awarded for those events. In men's bowling, a tie for second place in the singles and trios resulted in two silver medals per event, and thus no bronzes were awarded; a tie for the bronze-medal position in the doubles and the team of five meant that two bronzes were awarded for each event. In softball, due to rainy weather at the final competition the ranking was decided by the results of the preliminary round and semifinals. Japan was awarded the gold medal based on its unbeaten record in the preliminary games; China and Chinese Taipei shared the silver. Those two were to have played to decide who would meet Japan in the gold-medal game. In swimming, a tie for first position in the men's 50m freestyle resulted in two gold medals and no silver was awarded; a tie for second position in the women's 100m freestyle meant that no bronze medal was awarded.|$|E

5|$|When Arsenal {{was founded}} in 1886 by munition workers' from Woolwich, the club {{resisted}} the lure of professionalism and remained an amateur side. Success in local cup competitions soon followed, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tie</b> against Derby County in the FA Cup on 17 January 1891 led to the opposition approaching two of Arsenal's players, in view of offering them professional contracts. Later that year the club resigned its membership of the Kent County and London Football Associationsboth amateur governing bodiesand voted to turn professional, a move which attracted criticism from many southern clubs. In 1893, the club received an invitation to join the Football League, which the board accepted. Arsenal played in the Second Division for eleven seasons, while also participating in regional competitions, the Southern Combination and United League. The club won promotion in 1904, and enjoyed strong FA Cup campaigns in the mid-1900s, but the increase of football clubs in the capital and falling attendances at the Manor Ground pushed Arsenal close to bankruptcy by 1910. Sir Henry Norris and William Hall in that year took over Arsenal, and planned to relocate the team to Highbury {{in order to improve}} their financial standing. Arsenal were relegated back to the Second Division in 1913, but the move to North London brought about larger attendances than ever before.|$|E

25|$|During {{this era}} under Carr, Michigan began to {{establish}} for itself {{a reputation as}} a quarterback school, with future NFL quarterbacks such as Brian Griese (1993–1997), Tom Brady (1996–1999), Drew Henson (1998–2000), John Navarre (1999–2003), and Chad Henne (2004–2007) all playing for Michigan. With this string of quarterbacks, Michigan had a starting quarterback that later joined the NFL every year from 1993 through 2007.
