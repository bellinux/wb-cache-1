The British infantry and Home Guard had little with which to put up a fight against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of Molotov Cocktails and SIP grenades it was evident that they could do little to a modern tank other than to provide a blinding pall of smoke.

5|$|For {{the events}} {{surrounding}} 572, the most exhaustive source available is Paul the Deacon's Historia Langobardorum, {{a history of the}} Lombard nation up to 744. The book was finished {{in the last two decades}} of the 8th century, after the Lombard Kingdom had been conquered by the Franks in 774. Because of the apparent presence in the work of many fragments preserved from Lombard oral tradition, Paul's work has been often interpreted as a tribute to a vanishing culture. Among these otherwise lost traditions stands the tale of Alboin's death. According to Herwig Wolfram, what Paul deals with is an example of how nationally vital events were personalized to make them easier to preserve in the collective memory. Even later than the Historia Langobardorum, but possibly using earlier lost sources, are the last two primary sources to speak about Helmichis: the anonymous Historia Langobardorum Codicis Gothani and the Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae Ravennatis written by Andreas Agnellus. The first is a brief Christianizing version of the Origo that was made in the first decade of the 9th century from a Carolingian point of view. The second was written in the 830s by a priest from Ravenna and is a history of the bishops who held the see of Ravenna through the ages. Agnellus' passage on Alboin and Rosamund is mostly derived from Paul <b>and</b> <b>little</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E

Knowledge about the Atlantic African coast was fragmented and derived mainly from old Greek and Roman maps based on Carthaginian knowledge, including the time of Roman exploration of Mauritania.

25|$|La Rocca's {{arguments}} hinge {{upon the}} fact that there are few documents about Pacificus that can be proven to have been written from his lifetime. She admits the two documents relating to the establishment of the schola as legitimate, <b>and</b> <b>little</b> <b>else.</b> The epitaphs in the Verona cathedral, which had long been thought contemporaneous to Pacificus, she argues in fact date from the construction of the cathedral in the twelfth century. She argues that it was during the tenure of Theobald as archdeacon of Verona (1120-1135), who was the first bishop to be appointed from the ranks of the cathedral chapter (1135-1157), that Pacificus' name first appeared in reference to many documents related to the cathedral chapter's history and the founding of the schola and xenodochium. She argues that these documents were created to strengthen the chapter's claims to a number of churches and other properties in Verona, by constructing the story around Pacificus to illustrate the chapter's Carolingian roots and traditions in an attempt to support its claims of autonomy from the bishop of Verona and protect the chapter from the reforms within the church at the time. One of the items constructed during this period, according to La Rocca, is the epitaphs, or at least the first one, which were mounted in the Verona Cathedral, where they were publicly visible, to support their claims surrounding Pacificus and have him serve as a model of the duties of an archdeacon. She argues that it is based on this epitaph that much of the later work written about Pacificus is based upon, with later additions to his story being similarly constructed to serve the purposes of the present by moving the argument into the past, such as Panvinius' account of the trial surrounding the payment for the reconstruction of the city's walls being fabricated to underscore an argument the clergy of Verona were having at the time with the Venetian Republic's tax assessment of the church.|$|E
500|$|Ironclad {{construction}} also prefigured {{the later}} debate in battleship design between tapering and 'all-or-nothing' armor design.

[...] Inflexibles armor protection was largely limited to the central citadel amidships, protecting boilers and engines, turrets and magazines, <b>and</b> <b>little</b> <b>else.</b> An ingenious arrangement of cork-filled compartments and watertight bulkheads was intended to keep her stable and afloat in the event of heavy damage to her un-armored sections.|$|E

For example, in the Elkhorn Slough at Monterey Bay, cancrid crabs and innkeeper worms are mostly eaten in winter and spring, fish eggs from winter to early summer, bony fish in summer, and grapsid crabs and clams in fall.

There's the Unstoppable Monster ... or there's the Professional White Guy In A Suit With An Ego ... No matter which of the groups the above villains fall into, they share one common purpose: evil. The motivations for evil likely differ—although, invariably, they fall under the umbrella of 'misguided belief in a greater good that doesn't exist'—but that really doesn't matter, because without fail, there will be so little time in the movie to actually properly explore those motivations, meaning that to all intents and purposes, the villain is being evil for reasons of plot necessity <b>and</b> <b>little</b> <b>else</b> ...
