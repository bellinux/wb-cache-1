25|$|The wounded Emery {{suggests}} that Annie {{be killed in}} order to allow everyone to escape, alarming the rest of the group. While in the kitchen, Cathy Kramer is attacked by Mrs. Waterman and is rescued by Nick. The two decide to tie up the deranged woman and leave her in the kitchen. They agree not to inform Emery so that the unstable young man does not become more unbalanced. A ghostly Sukeena appears and drags Mrs. Waterman off into the dark wine cellar. As Nick and Cathy head back toward the main hall, the house changes around them and they become lost. A mysterious shape under the carpet chases them, and they flee. The shape begins to catch up to them, and Nick shoves Cathy into a room <b>and</b> <b>slams</b> <b>the</b> door behind her, turning around {{just in time to see}} a skeletal monster rushing up to him. With silence in the hallway, Cathy opens the door again but finds no sign of Nick or the entity in the empty hallway. As the house continues to change around her, Cathy ends up in the attic. Suddenly overcome by the urge to automatically write, she witnesses the murder of John Rimbauer by Ellen and Sukeena. Steve and Rachel, meanwhile, decide to look for Nick and Cathy. They find Cathy in the attic, where she is about to be attacked by a corpse-like creature. Their presence seemingly prevents the house from acting, and the corpse drops lifeless to the floor. The corpse's withered arm lets them deduce that the carcass is that of Steven's missing great-aunt (and Ellen's daughter), April Rimbauer. Suddenly, April's corpse releases a bright white light from its mouth and instantly disintegrates.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{aspects of}} Kiki's {{behavior}} and appearance {{have been the}} focus of commentary. One major theme is Kiki's transition into adulthood. While being raised by loving parents who support her independence, [...] Kiki is faced with problems common in adolescence such as finding a job, seeking acceptance, and taking care of herself. The concept of vulnerability is also examined closely in the film. Critic Mark Schilling noted a scene during Kiki's first night away from home, staying with the bakers: [...] Early in the morning, she quickly steps out of her room into the outhouses and peers out to see the husband, Fukuo, stretching his muscles. After he leaves the scene, Kiki rushes back to her room <b>and</b> <b>slams</b> <b>the</b> door behind her while gasping for air. [...] "The scene does absolutely nothing to advance the plot and the humor in it is low...but...it wordlessly — and eloquently — expresses Kiki's youth, vulnerability, and isolation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two months later, Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa), {{working with}} {{homeless}} people, sees Ian at a homeless shelter. Tanya Cross (Jo Joyner), Max Branning (Jake Wood) and Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) find him {{and bring him}} back to the Square but Lucy is unsympathetic, angered by his leaving her and Bobby, <b>and</b> <b>slams</b> <b>the</b> door in his face. Ian refuses to acknowledge anyone. He stays with Tanya and Max until Phil finds out he is back and takes him to his house to ensure he does not tell anybody about Ben murdering Heather. Ian continues to be unresponsive until Phil's partner Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) mentions Heather, and his memory returns. Ben attempts to help Ian by taking him to the café, but Lucy screams and has him physically removed. Ian, extremely miserable, collapses in tears outside, while Phil worries that Ian will remember that Ben murdered Heather. After Sharon returns to Walford, she successfully persuades Lucy to give Ian another chance. Lucy agrees but on the condition that Ian signs all of his businesses over to her so that if Ian abandons her again she can be financially secure. [...] Ian agrees to this. Ben confesses to murdering Heather and is remanded in custody, leaving Ian shocked. He starts working again at the café and getting back into his old life. Phil then gets Ian to visit Ben in prison to try to get him to retract his confession, but Ian says he cannot tell Ben what is right.

2500|$|In Portal 2, GLaDOS {{initially}} resumes {{her role}} as test monitor in a now-ruined facility after Wheatley inadvertently reactivates her. This time, she makes no attempt to hide her contempt and hatred for Chell; this is partly because Chell outwitted her, and partly because a backup system has forced her to relive her death over and over since her deactivation. Soon after she repairs the facility, a plot twist occurs when Wheatley convinces Chell to perform a core transfer, putting him {{in charge of the}} facility in place of GLaDOS. At this point he immediately becomes power-mad and puts GLaDOS into a potato battery after she tells him what he was originally designed to be a moron. He then turns on Chell <b>and</b> <b>slams</b> <b>the</b> elevator they are in, sending both into the bowels of the facility. GLaDOS is kidnapped by a bird and later saved by Chell, who teams up with GLaDOS to escape from the facility. While they are escaping from the old testing facility, GLaDOS discovers that her personality originally came from an assistant to former Aperture CEO Cave Johnson named Caroline, who was later uploaded into the GLaDOS program (it is suggested that this might have been done against her will at Cave Johnson's urging). The two of them find their way back to the testing facility, where Wheatley tasks them with completing tests until he springs a trap upon them and fails to kill them. Once they find Wheatley's lair, they cause him to become corrupted and switch GLaDOS back in charge of the facility. Anticipating the outcome, Wheatley boobytraps the trigger system with explosives. The deteriorating facility's ceiling starts to collapse, which Chell uses to shoot a portal at the moon and suck Wheatley and herself into space. GLaDOS rescues Chell, and shows relief for her safety. However, GLaDOS is able to discover where Caroline is in her brain, and immediately deletes her, reverting to her old self. Nevertheless, she decides that it is in her best interest to let Chell go, as GLaDOS learned the easiest solution is usually the best one, and felt that killing Chell was [...] "too hard".|$|E
