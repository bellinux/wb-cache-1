5|$|The new {{brigadier general}} {{was placed in}} command of the Albany post, serving under Major General Jeffery Amherst. In 1759, shortly after {{capturing}} Ticonderoga without a fight, General Amherst learned of the death of General John Prideaux whose expedition had captured Fort Niagara. Amherst then ordered Gage to take Prideaux's place, and to take Fort de La Présentation (also known as Fort La Galette) {{at the mouth of the}} Oswegatchie River on Lake Ontario. When Amherst learned that the French had also abandoned Fort St. Frédéric, he sent a messenger after Gage with more explicit instructions to capture La Galette <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>if</b> at all possible, to advance on Montreal.|$|E

5|$|Vertical jumps (high {{jump and}} pole vault) set a bar at a {{particular}} height. The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that are holding the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt, {{which can be used}} to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so on down the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>if</b> still tied, {{by the total number of}} misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.|$|E
5|$|Where {{the late}} army {{appears to have}} evolved to some extent is in battle tactics. The older army of the Principate had relied on a barrage of heavy {{javelins}} (pila) followed by an infantry charge, which was often sufficient to shatter, or at least disorganise, the barbarian line. After that, legionaries were trained to engage in aggressive hand-to-hand combat, using the gladius short-sword to execute quick thrusts at the abdomen of their enemies, {{in a similar manner}} to more recent bayonet drill. In close combat, the Romans had the crucial advantage of superior armour, and such tactics very often resulted in the rout of the less well-equipped and trained barbarian foe. The mounted archers and slingers in front of the main infantry line would loose their missiles on the enemy before the infantry lines engaged and would then hastily retreat to the rear of their own infantry line, whence, in conjunction with the foot archers already there, they would loose a continuous rain of missiles on the enemy foot by shooting over the heads of their own infantry. The cavalry's task on each wing was to scatter the enemy cavalry facing them <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>if</b> possible, to encircle the main body of enemy infantry and attack them from the flanks and rear.|$|E

25|$|Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) is {{a chronic}} skin {{disorder}} observed primarily in Europe among the elderly.

25|$|The string method uses splines {{connecting}} the points, , {{to measure and}} enforce distance constraints between the points and to calculate the tangent at each point. In each step of an optimization procedure, the points might be moved according to the force acting on them perpendicular to the path, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>if</b> the equidistance constraint between the points is no-longer satisfied, the points can be redistributed, using the spline representation of the path to generate new vectors with the required spacing.|$|E
25|$|By default, an IEEE 754 {{exception}} is resumable and is handled by substituting a predefined value for different exceptions, e.g. infinity for a divide by zero exception, and providing status flags for later checking {{of whether the}} exception occurred (see C99 programming language for a typical example of handling of IEEE 754 exceptions). An exception-handling style enabled {{by the use of}} status flags involves: first computing an expression using a fast, direct implementation; checking whether it failed by testing status flags; <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>if</b> necessary, calling a slower, more numerically robust, implementation.|$|E

25|$|In cricket, a {{follow-on}} {{is where}} the team that bats second is forced to take its second batting innings immediately after its first, because the team {{was not able to}} get close enough to the score achieved by the first team batting in the first innings. If the second team to bat scores substantially fewer runs than the first team, the first team have the option of enforcing the follow-on, that is, instructing the second team to bat again immediately. In this case the sequence of batting innings will be first team, second team, second team <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>if</b> required, the first team again. This is in contrast to the normal progression of batting innings which is first team, second team, first team, second team. The first team may choose not to enforce the follow-on, and bat themselves instead.|$|E
25|$|A {{component}} of stimulus control therapy is sleep restriction, {{a technique that}} aims to match the time spent in bed with actual time spent asleep. This technique involves maintaining a strict sleep-wake schedule, sleeping only at certain {{times of the day}} and for specific amounts of time to induce mild sleep deprivation. Complete treatment usually lasts up to 3 weeks and involves making oneself sleep for only a minimum amount of time that they are actually capable of on average, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>if</b> capable (i.e. when sleep efficiency improves), slowly increasing this amount (~15 min) by going to bed earlier as the body attempts to reset its internal sleep clock. Bright light therapy, which is often used to help early morning wakers reset their natural sleep cycle, can also be used with sleep restriction therapy to reinforce a new wake schedule. Although applying this technique with consistency is difficult, it can {{have a positive effect on}} insomnia in motivated patients.|$|E
25|$|In a {{language}} with lazy evaluation, like Haskell, a list is evaluated {{only to the}} degree that its elements are requested: for example, if one asks for the first element of a list, only the first element will be computed. With respect to usage of the list monad for non-deterministic computation that means that we can non-deterministically generate a lazy list of all results of the computation and ask for the first of them, and only as much work will be performed as is needed to get that first result. The process roughly corresponds to backtracking: a path of computation is chosen, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>if</b> it fails at some point (if it evaluates mzero), then it backtracks to the last branching point, and follows the next path, and so on. If the second element is then requested, it again does just enough work to get the second solution, and so on. So the list monad is a simple way to implement a backtracking algorithm in a lazy language.|$|E
