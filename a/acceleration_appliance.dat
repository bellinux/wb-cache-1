5000|$|ISP: Through {{discontinuation}} of NetApp's NetCache in 2006 and Packeteer's {{product line}} in 2008, Blue Coat's ProxySG {{is not only}} a cache, but also a UTM, P2P control and WAN <b>acceleration</b> <b>appliance.</b> The addition of such features (that are more aimed at the corporate market and of limited use to ISPs) have increased the cost per URL/sec that can be cached. Conversely; CACHEbox is one of the only dedicated caches still available.|$|E
50|$|The ANX 1500 {{throughput}} <b>acceleration</b> <b>appliance</b> supported TCP/IP, NFS, DHCP and 10GbE {{standards and}} features 48GB of DRAM {{and up to}} 4TB of solid state drives. The ANX 1500 caches active data stemming from client requests, such as frequent access of the same payload data or NFS metadata, and optimizes performance {{through the use of}} TCP and NFS Offload technology embedded in Alacritech’s custom silicon. The ANX 1500 has a two-tiered caching system that provides record performance by accelerating READ and NFS metadata-intensive OPS, greatly reducing the burden on existing NAS devices, and enabling better WRITE performance and scalability. With a performance layer based on frequency of use, NFS OPS are maximized, resulting in reduced traffic on backend NAS servers, and a dramatic reduction in total IOPS required and storage drives needed from back-end storage.|$|E

5000|$|Compression - Relies on data {{patterns}} {{that can be}} represented more efficiently. Essentially compression techniques similar to ZIP, RAR, ARJ etc. are applied on-the-fly to data passing through hardware (or virtual machine) based WAN <b>acceleration</b> <b>appliances.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Alacritech was a Silicon Valley {{company which}} marketed [...] "intelligent" [...] network {{interface}} cards (NICs) to offload TCP/IP processing from the CPU of computer systems to dedicated hardware on the NIC: a concept {{now known as}} a [...] "TCP offload engine" [...] (TOE). Later it manufactured storage network products. Alacritech’s main products were the ANX 1500 series of network throughput <b>acceleration</b> <b>appliances.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) is {{technology}} {{developed by}} Cisco Systems that optimizes {{the performance of}} any TCP-based application operating in a wide area network (WAN) environment while preserving and strengthening branch security. WAAS combines WAN optimization, acceleration of TCP-based applications, and Cisco's Wide Area File Services (WAFS) in a single appliance or blade. It is Cisco's attempt to keep WAN optimization residing firmly in the router, eliminating the need to deploy <b>acceleration</b> <b>appliances</b> throughout the infrastructure. The technology preserves TCP information within the network while offering the performance benefits that come along with using WAN optimization technology.|$|R
