5|$|A small species, the Inaccessible Island rail has brown plumage {{and a black}} {{bill and}} feet. It {{occupies}} most habitats on Inaccessible Island, from the beaches to the central plateau, feeding {{on a variety of}} small invertebrates <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> plant matter. Pairs are territorial and monogamous, with both parents being responsible for incubating the eggs and raising the chicks. Its adaptations to living on a tiny island at high densities include low base metabolic rates, small clutch sizes, and flightlessness.|$|E

5|$|Water pipits {{construct}} a cup-like nest {{on the ground}} under vegetation or in cliff crevices and lay four to six speckled grey-ish white eggs, which hatch in about two weeks with a further 14–15days to fledging. Although pipits occasionally catch insects in flight, they feed mainly on small invertebrates picked off the ground or vegetation, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> plant material.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in October 2003. The {{overview}} {{of the game}}'s story was originally drafted before the first Knights of the Old Republic was released, after which it saw many revisions <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> major redrafts. In preparation to write Knights of the Old Republic II, Chris Avellone, the game's lead designer, tried {{to learn as much}} about the Star Wars universe as possible. He read many books, guides, modules, and graphic novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first Knights of the Old Republic and the original Star Wars films for inspiration. Avellone said that Obsidian recognized {{one of the things that}} made Knights of the Old Republic great was the story and the companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them.|$|E
5|$|Disraeli's {{political}} views embraced certain Radical policies, particularly democratic {{reform of the}} electoral system, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> Tory ones, including protectionism. He began to move in Tory circles. In 1834 he {{was introduced to the}} former Lord Chancellor, Lord Lyndhurst, by Henrietta Sykes, wife of Sir Francis Sykes. She {{was having an affair with}} Lyndhurst, and began another with Disraeli. Disraeli and Lyndhurst took an immediate liking to each other. Lyndhurst was an indiscreet gossip with a fondness for intrigue; this appealed greatly to Disraeli, who became his secretary and go-between. In 1835 Disraeli stood for the last time as a Radical, unsuccessfully contesting High Wycombe once again.|$|E

5|$|Horsefield founded {{one such}} society, the Prestwich Botanical Society, {{and was later}} {{president}} of a larger botanical society covering a wide area around north Manchester.

He lived most of his life near Whitefield in Lancashire, in dire poverty. At {{the time of his death}} he had been married for 42 years and had fathered eleven children.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{features}} of the Cunard Building are the large basement and sub-basement levels that initially acted as storage facilities for both the Company's property and also the luggage of passengers. Coal was also stored in the basement, with a small railway track providing {{a link to the}} boiler room, which was used to heat the building. Many original features of the basement still exist, including the timber baggage racks, ship logs and other maritime documents. Several secure vaults, which in the past were used to store the most valuable passenger items, are still used today to hold historic documents, drawings and blueprints relating to the Cunard Building <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> of Cunard's Liners, such as the RMS Queen Mary.|$|E
5|$|The Lingbao School {{borrowed}} many concepts from Buddhism, {{including the}} concept of reincarnation, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> cosmological elements. Although reincarnation was an important concept in the Lingbao School, the earlier Daoist belief in attaining immortality remained. The school's pantheon is similar to Shangqing and Celestial Master Daoism, with {{one of its most}} important gods being the deified form of Laozi. Other gods also existed, some of whom were in charge of preparing spirits for reincarnation. Lingbao ritual was initially in individual practice, but later went through a transformation that put more emphasis on collective rites. The most important scripture in the Lingbao School is known as the Five Talismans (Wufujing), which was compiled by Ge Chaofu and based on Ge Hong's earlier alchemical works.|$|E

A survey in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire also noted a memorial to Hugh Wynne, who died in 1714: he was Chancellor of Bangor Cathedral and rector of Aberffraw and Trefdraeth. Two copper collecting shovels with wooden handles were given to St Beuno's in 1777 by Hugh Williams, the rector.|$|E
5|$|The {{northeast}} monsoon, {{which begins}} in September, lasts through the post-monsoon seasons, and only ends in March. It carries winds {{that have already}} lost their moisture out to the ocean (opposite from the summer monsoon). They cross India diagonally from northeast to southwest. However, the large indentation made by the Bay of Bengal into India's eastern coast means that the flows are humidified before reaching Cape Comorin and rest of Tamil Nadu, meaning that the state, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> parts of Kerala, experience significant precipitation in the post-monsoon and winter periods. However, parts of West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Mumbai also receive minor precipitation from the north-east monsoon.|$|E
