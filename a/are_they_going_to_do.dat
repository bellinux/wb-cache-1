500|$|Even {{though the}} episode aired during the {{beginning}} of the fifth season, it was produced by the crew of the fourth season. A large part of the original crew left the show after season four. This led to the addition of several scenes, which normally would not have been considered, because the mentality of the departing crew was [...] "what <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> get us fired?" [...] Although most of the episode was completed by the staff of season four, the end was rewritten by the team of season five.|$|E
500|$|Father Ernest Sugule, {{national}} {{coordinator of the}} Congolese non-governmental organization SAIPD in Dungu, DRC, claimed that the few people there [...] "who have succeeded in watching [...] are very critical on the film," [...] as is he himself. Charlie Beckett, a media communications expert at the London School of Economics (LSE), said Invisible Children ,"haven't got the capacity for is to take that beyond another action. What <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with all this energy and interest? It's going to dissipate. ... I think this will crash and die, I don't think they will catch Kony. People will say they bought the bracelet and stuck posters on lamppost but that could have negative effects when it doesn't actually lead anywhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hoggard was {{considered}} a scapegoat for his sudden falling out of favour the England and Wales Cricket Board. [...] "We've had the same problems with the ECB since I started international cricket," [...] {{he wrote in his}} book. [...] "There were people slagging them off when I first came in and there are people still slagging them off. [...] And it's not the ECB who pick the side anyway. [...] See {{if you can find a}} player with a good word to say about the ECB. [...] What <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> sue me for telling the truth?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Fifty {{motions to}} reopen divorce cases {{that had been}} handled by Garson were {{received}} by New York's chief administrative judge for matrimonial cases. Of those, three or four were granted a hearing, and eventually settled. However, even in cases that involved both Garson and Siminovsky, rulings were not necessarily reviewed or overturned. To receive a hearing, parties were required to demonstrate some likelihood {{that they had not}} received a fair trial. Criticizing a process that required parties who did not have subpoena powers or wiretaps to prove corruption in each case, the President of the New York State chapter of the National Organization for Women said: [...] "The burden of proof is going to fall on them to show the case is corrupted; and how <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Moir's article {{resulted}} in over 25,000 complaints to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) that day, causing its site to crash for several hours. Derren Brown and Stephen Fry used Twitter to front an online {{campaign against the}} Daily Mail and Jan Moir throughout the afternoon and a Facebook page was set up urging followers to complain to the brands whose advertisements featured alongside the article. Fry wrote, [...] "I gather a repulsive nobody writing in a paper no one of any decency would be seen dead with has written something loathesome and inhumane". Brown wrote, [...] "If Gateley's [...] passing causes today's kind of gutter-journalism to be held to account, we can perhaps {{take that as a}} tribute". Father Ted and The IT Crowd writer Graham Linehan called for a complete boycott of the Daily Mail, tweeting [...] "Which brands advertise in the Mail? Are they aware of Jan Moir's piece?...what <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> about it?". Details of companies with advertisements on the same web page as Moir's article were posted on a specially established Facebook page named [...] "The Daily Mail should retract Jan Moir's hateful, homophobic article". According to The Guardian details about where Moir lived were posted on the Internet and a false rumour that the Daily Mail had reported Cowles as Gately's murderer was repeated on Twitter.|$|E

6000|$|The crowd {{gathered}} around them, still very threatening in attitude, yet clearly afraid to approach within arm's-length of the strangers.

60|$|But {{behind all}} these {{conceivable}} triumphs of scientific adjustment and direction lies the infinitely greater difficulty {{on our way}} to the Great State, the difficulty of direction.

They have them, and what <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> about it? Now I like gambling. I like to play the game. I want to play it big and play it quick. I'm just made that way. And I play it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course I did!' Henry replied. 'I {{said that}} I held her {{responsible}} for the discovery, though I had not mentioned her connection with it to the authorities as yet. She went on with her writing as if I had spoken in an unknown tongue! I was equally obstinate, on my side. I told her plainly that the head had been placed {{under the care of}} the police, and that the manager and I had signed our declarations and given our evidence. She paid not the slightest heed to me. By way of tempting her to speak, I added that the whole investigation was to be kept a secret, and that she might depend on my discretion. For the moment I thought I had succeeded. She looked up from her writing with a passing flash of curiosity, and said, [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it?"--meaning, I suppose, the head. I answered that it was to be privately buried, after photographs of it had first been taken. I even went the length of communicating the opinion of the surgeon consulted, that some chemical means of arresting decomposition had been used and had only partially succeeded--and I asked her point-blank if the surgeon was right? The trap was not a bad one--but it completely failed. She said in the coolest manner, [...] "Now you are here, I should like to consult you about my play; I am at a loss for some new incidents." [...] Mind! there was nothing satirical in this. She was really eager to read her wonderful work to me--evidently supposing that I took a special interest in such things, because my brother is the manager of a theatre! I left her, making the first excuse that occurred to me. So far as I am concerned, I can do nothing with her. But it is possible that your influence may succeed with her again, as it has succeeded already. Will you make the attempt, to satisfy your own mind? She is still upstairs; and I am quite ready to accompany you.' ...|$|E
