500|$|Sir James Henare, {{the most}} revered {{of the elders}} of Tai Tokerau, got up and said, [...] "You've proven {{that it could be}} done. And you've also proven that our {{ancestors}} did it.... because the five tribes of Tai Tokerau trace their ancestry from the names of the canoes they arrived in, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> people from Hawai'i came by canoe, therefore by our traditions, you must be the sixth tribe of Tai Tokerau.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} {{announcement}} of the concert in Singapore, also in the same month, it was revealed that she was chosen by David Foster as one of the guest artists in a one-night only [...] "David Foster and Friends" [...] show that was originally scheduled as the major event of Sapurakencana Petroleum Malaysia Grand Prix Gala Dinner & Concert 2014 on 27 March. However, due to the date's proximity to the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 incident, the entire show was later revamped to become a full-fledged tribute concert. During the night of the show, she was accompanied by Foster on piano to perform two songs that Foster originally produced - I Will Always Love You <b>and</b> <b>Because</b> <b>You</b> Loved Me. Foster also accompanied Siti to Siti's own single, Seindah Biasa.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Kidman won {{critical}} {{praise for}} her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in Stephen Daldry's The Hours, which stars Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore. Kidman famously wore prosthetics that {{were applied to}} her nose making her almost unrecognisable playing the author during her time in 1920s England, and her bouts with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel, Mrs. Dalloway. The film earned positive notices and several nominations, including for an Academy Award for Best Picture. The New York Times wrote that, [...] "Ms. Kidman, in a performance of astounding bravery, evokes the savage inner war waged by a brilliant mind against a system of faulty wiring that transmits a searing, crazy static into her brain". Kidman won numerous critics' awards, including her first BAFTA, third Golden Globe, and the Academy Award for Best Actress. As the first Australian actress to win an Academy Award, Kidman made a teary acceptance speech {{about the importance of}} art, even during times of war, saying, [...] "Why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil? Because art is important. <b>And</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> believe in what you do and you want to honour that, and it is a tradition that needs to be upheld." ...|$|E

2500|$|Both sides accuse {{each other}} of using underhanded tactics {{to pack the}} {{commission}} with countries sympathetic to their position. Edwin Snagg, the IWC commissioner for St Vincent and the Grenadines stated, [...] "It's a question of respect,....Because you are small <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> are underdeveloped there is this view and there is this feeling that you can easily be bought and you can easily be sold. We in the Caribbean feel highly offended." [...] Moreover, there are no developing countries who support an anti-whaling stance. The BBC reported that [...] "Some countries recently admitted to the European Union have been advised by a [...] "word in the ear" [...] {{that it would be}} [...] "a good idea" [...] for them to join the IWC. Some activists believe that Britain and its fellow EU old-timers such as France and Germany should recruit all member states into the Commission." [...] In Australia, National Nine News reported that [...] "New Zealand is questioning pro-whaling support among Pacific Island states with the opposition calling for a rethink of foreign aid." [...] It is expected that more countries in the future will join IWC including some landlocked countries. Currently, there are 8 landlocked IWC members. Mali and Mongolia voted with other pro-whaling countries. Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Switzerland and San Marino voted with other anti-whaling countries.|$|E
