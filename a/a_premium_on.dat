Total mintage of the special quarter would be limited to 40,000 specimens.|$|E
5|$|Chappuis {{was drafted}} by the Pittsburgh Steelers, and reports in February 1948 {{indicated}} that the Steelers had offered him a two-year contract for $20,000 per year. However, Chappuis passed up the Steelers' offer, opting instead {{to play for the}} new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). In June 1948, Chappuis signed with Branch Rickey's Brooklyn Dodgers of the AAFC after coach Carl Voyles outbid the Steelers for his services at $17,000. Chappuis had been drafted by the Cleveland Browns, and the Dodgers gave the Browns three draft picks in exchange for the right to sign Chappuis. Rickey had felt that modern football was based on speed and that he could win with a good center, passing quarterback and two tall sprinting ends. Thus, he placed <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> signing Chappuis, the passing quarterback. The college All-star game caused Chappuis to miss three weeks of practice and he played little in the early season games because he had not learned his plays.|$|E

5|$|After {{the season}} ended, Joss {{returned}} to Wisconsin where he led Racine to the 1901 Wisconsin baseball state championship against Rube Waddell's Kenosha squad. He also enrolled at Beloit College and played American football. It {{was reported that}} Joss had signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers of the National League as early as August 18 and received a $400 advance ($), but Joss denied receiving any money. Mud Hens owner Charles Stroebel stated that he had signed Joss and other Mud Hens players for the 1902 season on August 12 and that the Western League was {{under the protection of}} the National League through September 1901. Before 1901 ended, the Cleveland Bronchos offered $500 ($) to Toledo in exchange for Joss and manager Bob Gilks, who would be a scout for Cleveland. Toledo and Joss agreed and Joss was now a member of the American League, which was paying <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> baseball talent to rival the National League. Dodgers owner Charles Ebbets invited Joss for a meeting, which Joss declined, and Joss {{let it be known that}} he had told Stroebel he would play for the Mud Hens for the 1902 season, and received a $150 ($) advance in February 1902.|$|E

25|$|The {{widespread}} use of such types of GM soybeans in the Americas has caused problems with exports to some regions. GM crops require extensive certification {{before they can be}} legally imported into the European Union, where there is considerable supplier and consumer reluctance to use GM products for consumer or animal use. Difficulties with coexistence and subsequent traces of cross-contamination of non-GM stocks have caused shipments to be rejected and have put <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> non-GM soy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, the Alaskan gold rush created {{a demand for}} American-flagged ships.

Shortly thereafter, she was requisitioned by the U.S. Navy {{to serve as a}} troopship during the Spanish–American War.|$|E
25|$|The Nintendo 64's central {{processing}} unit (CPU) is the NEC VR4300. Popular Electronics said it had power similar to the Pentium processors found in desktop computers. Except for its narrower 32-bit system bus, the VR4300 retained the computational abilities of the more powerful 64-bit MIPS R4300i, though software rarely took advantage of 64-bit data precision operations. Nintendo 64 games generally used faster (and more compact) 32-bit data-operations, as these were sufficient to generate 3D-scene data for the console's RSP (Reality Signal Processor) unit. In addition, 32-bit code executes faster and requires less storage space (which is at <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> the Nintendo 64's cartridges).|$|E

25|$|Retrospectively rated {{insurance}} {{is a method}} of establishing <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> large commercial accounts. The final premium {{is based on the}} insured's actual loss experience during the policy term, sometimes subject to a minimum and maximum premium, with the final premium determined by a formula. Under this plan, the current year's premium is based partially (or wholly) on the current year's losses, although the premium adjustments may take months or years beyond the current year's expiration date. The rating formula is guaranteed in the insurance contract. Formula: retrospective premium = converted loss + basic premium × tax multiplier. Numerous variations of this formula have been developed and are in use.|$|E
25|$|FETs {{often have}} a very low 'on' {{resistance}} and have a high 'off' resistance. However the intermediate resistances are significant, and so FETs can dissipate large amounts of power while switching. Thus efficiency can put <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> switching quickly, but this can cause transients that can excite stray inductances and generate significant voltages that can couple to the gate and cause unintentional switching. FET circuits can therefore require very careful layout and can involve trades between switching speed and power dissipation. There is also a trade-off between voltage rating and 'on' resistance, so high voltage FETs have a relatively high 'on' resistance and hence conduction losses.|$|E
25|$|One {{thousand}} acres (4km²) were {{set aside for}} development as a luxury resort by the for-profit Heavenly Mountain, with over a hundred lots for sale. A 2006 article in the High Country Press reported that <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> the home prices helped to fund the SCA. The project was controversial in the area until Kaplan {{reached out to the}} community. However, Kaplan, a Purusha group member who left the group to marry, broke away from the movement in 2004 and decided to develop the land commercially. The SCA was evicted in 2006. Some home buyers were upset about being evicted and filed lawsuits and as of 2006, 44 condos and homes were still occupied.|$|E

25|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War {{presented}} an opportunity to reshape the international system. This opportunity was afforded to the Cold War's victor's-- that is to say—the United States and other western capitalist states governed by liberal-democratic values that put <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> basic human rights and democratization. In the preceding decades the state was the only entity to receive special status. While there were exceptions, such as groups struggling against colonial powers, the state possessed the ultimate degree of legitimacy. As a result, the international community rarely meddled with the internal machinations of a given country. Sovereignty {{was not to be}} violated and this was a system which benefited both superpowers, their allies, as well as third world governments.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prolific}} fish such as herrings and sardines are abundant in given waters {{only in their}} season so keeping them for use out of season required salting or smoking them. This permitted their sale in inland markets too but fresh fish tasted better {{so long as it}} really was fresh. There was therefore <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> fresh fish in this top end of the market. The medieval chasse-marée merchants catered to this originally by carrying fish in pairs of baskets on pack ponies, as far as possible, overnight. They rushed la marée (the batch from a particular landing) to market but the distance coverable before the fish deteriorated was limited. Another problem was that every lord through whose manor the road led wanted his toll so that if the road was too long, the enterprise became less economic.|$|E
25|$|Greg Hill still {{refused to}} race ABA races because he {{allegedly}} hated the ABA's direct transfer {{system in which}} the winner of the first moto would then sit out and not race the second and third cycle of motos until the Main, or if the race is big enough, the semis, quarter semis, etc. He and many other racers preferred the NBL's Olympic or cumulative {{system in which the}} qualifying rounds would be run three times and the average place in each round would be added and the four lowest numbers would advance to the main. This system put <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> consistency while the Transfer System was a little closer to luck, both good and bad for a racer. The ABA used a similar system during its controversial 1982 and 1983 Grand Nationals to choose its number one title to minimize anyone lucking into or out of the title. Also, points are awarded in the motos in the Cumulative System as well as the main so the racer doesn't walk away with nothing if he doesn't advance. Hill's objections seem odd considering he would race in the future sanctioning body the United States Bicycle Association (USBA) which used the transfer system. The USBA did offer larger, more consistent pro purses than the ABA generally.|$|E
