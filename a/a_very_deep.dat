5|$|Cladistic {{analyses}} of tyrannosaurid phylogeny often find Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa, with Daspletosaurus more basal than either. A {{close relationship between}} Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus is supported by numerous skull features, including the pattern of sutures between certain bones, {{the presence of a}} crescent-shaped crest on the postorbital bone behind each eye, and <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>deep</b> maxilla with a noticeable downward curve on the lower edge, among others. An alternative hypothesis was presented in a 2003 study by Phil Currie and colleagues, which found weak support for Daspletosaurus as a basal member of a clade also including Tarbosaurus and Alioramus, both from Asia, based on the absence of a bony prong connecting the nasal and lacrimal bones. Alioramus was found to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus in this study, based on a similar pattern of stress distribution in the skull.|$|E

25|$|The Saint Croix in Minnesota and Wisconsin {{is another}} {{important}} river in the Driftless Area, {{as it was the}} outlet for Glacial Lake Duluth, forerunner to Lake Superior, when the eastern outlet was blocked by the continental ice sheet. These rivers all have deep, dramatic canyons giving testimony to the immense quantity of water which once surged through them. The Wisconsin River drained Glacial Lake Wisconsin. Glacial River Warren, whose bed is now occupied by the Minnesota River, drained the colossal Glacial Lake Agassiz. There was ample water to dig <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>deep,</b> hundreds-of-miles-long gash into the North American bedrock.|$|E

25|$|A good {{description}} of the House as it stood before the siege {{is found in the}} Marquis's own Diary.

The lofty Gate-house, with four Turrets, looking Northwards, on the right hand thereof, without the ditch, a goodly building containing two fair courts; before them was the Grange, severed by a wall and common road, etc. Some idea of the magnitude of the place may be founds when it is remembered that from a survey made in 1798 the area of the works including gardens and entrenchments, covered about fourteen and a half acres.|$|E
25|$|The {{mole plough}} allows {{underdrainage}} {{to be installed}} without trenches, or it breaks up deep impermeable soil layers that impede drainage. It is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>deep</b> plough, with a torpedo-shaped or wedge-shaped tip, and a narrow blade connecting this to the body. When dragged through the ground, it leaves a channel deep under the ground, and this acts as a drain. Modern mole ploughs may also bury a flexible perforated plastic drain pipe as they go, making a more permanent drain– {{or they may be}} used to lay pipes for water supply or other purposes. Similar machines, so called pipe-and-cable-laying ploughs, are even used under the sea, for the laying of cables, as well as preparing the earth for side-scan sonar in a process used in oil exploration.|$|E

A simple check can be made to find if the subsoil is in the right condition for mole ploughing. Compact a tennis ball sized sample taken at moling depth by hand, then push a pencil through. If the hole remains intact without splitting the ball the soil is in an ideal condition for the mole plough.|$|E

Theoretically, you can get <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>deep</b> story and you can go so deep and open the world so beautifully, but it takes time to do that." [...] The story included normal and surreal elements, much like Lynch's earlier series Twin Peaks.

Carnotaurus was further characterized by small, vestigial forelimbs and long and slender hindlimbs.

500|$|This {{movement}} was portrayed by Robert Simpson as {{arising from the}} ashes and ruins left by {{the conflict in the}} first movement. In the first edition of his book he expressed hesitation over analysing this part, feeling that it either requires <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>deep</b> analysis, or should be described in the fewest possible words. Jack Lawson, founder and president of The Carl Nielsen Society of Great Britain, commented that in the second movement, the listener [...] "inhabits a world reborn, at first calm but a world which produces new struggles and menacing dangers" [...] and [...] "transports the listener through the depths or above the heights of more standard musical perceptions".|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} {{structural feature}} of RNA that distinguishes it from DNA {{is the presence}} of a hydroxyl group at the 2' position of the ribose sugar. The presence of this functional group causes the helix to mostly adopt the A-form geometry, although in single strand dinucleotide contexts, RNA can rarely also adopt the B-form most commonly observed in DNA. [...] The A-form geometry results in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>deep</b> and narrow major groove and a shallow and wide minor groove. A second consequence of the presence of the 2'-hydroxyl group is that in conformationally flexible regions of an RNA molecule (that is, not involved in formation of a double helix), it can chemically attack the adjacent phosphodiester bond to cleave the backbone.|$|E
500|$|The {{smallest}} subwoofers {{are typically}} those designed for desktop multimedia systems. [...] The largest common subwoofer enclosures are those used for concert sound reinforcement systems or dance club sound systems. [...] An {{example of a}} large concert subwoofer enclosure is the 1980s-era ElectroVoice MT-4 [...] "Bass Cube" [...] system, which used four 18-inch (45cm) drivers. An example of a subwoofer that uses a bass horn is the Bassmaxx B-Two, which loads an 18-inch (45cm) driver onto an [...] long folded horn. Folded horn-type subwoofers can typically produce a deeper range with greater efficiency than the same driver in an enclosure that lacks a horn. Some experimental fixed-installation subwoofer horns have been constructed using brick and concrete to produce a very long horn that allows <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>deep</b> sub-bass extension.|$|E

In 2016, Godrich said of the collaboration: [...] "I can only ever have one band like Radiohead who I've worked with for this many years. That's <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>deep</b> and profound relationship. The Beatles could only have ever had one George Martin; they couldn't have switched producers halfway through their career.

500|$|What {{is often}} {{referred}} to as [...] "clit piercing" [...] is actually the more common (and significantly less complicated) clitoral hood piercing. Since clitoral piercing is difficult and very painful, piercing of the clitoral hood is more common than piercing the clitoral shaft, owing to the small percentage of people who are anatomically suited for it. Clitoral hood piercings are usually channeled in the form of vertical piercings, and, to a lesser extent, horizontal piercings. The triangle piercing is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>deep</b> horizontal hood piercing, and is done behind the clitoris as opposed to in front of it. For styles such as the Isabella, which pass through the clitoral shaft but are placed deep at the base, they provide unique stimulation and still require the proper genital build; the Isabella starts between the clitoral glans and the urethra, exiting at the top of the clitoral hood; this piercing is highly risky with regard to damage that may occur because of intersecting nerves.|$|E
