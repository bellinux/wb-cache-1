40|$|Co-worker {{support has}} {{received}} an increasing {{amount of attention}} recently due to the positive effects it can have in the workplace. It can increase job satisfaction and {{has been found to}} help reduce work stress. As both of these are possible antecedents of intention to quit, this study investigated employee perceptions of perceived co-worker support and its effect on job satisfaction, work stress <b>and</b> <b>intention</b> to quit. It was theorised that co-worker support would have a positive relationship with job satisfaction and negative relationships with work stress <b>and</b> <b>intention</b> to quit. Co-worker support was also hypothesised to act as a moderator variable in the relationship between job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>intention</b> to quit <b>and</b> the relationship between work stress <b>and</b> <b>intention</b> to quit.

5|$|German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has {{proposed}} a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics.

Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.|$|E

As a result, South Vietnamese aerial interdiction of the communist logistical build-up became almost impossible and reconnaissance flights were held to a minimum.

Testing of the research model is conducted using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analytical techniques. The result of the testing using SEM shows that the model is fit while from the hypothesis testing results indicate that distributive justice proved to have a significant positive effect on job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>intention</b> to stay, career plateau proved to have no significant effect on job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>intention</b> to stay; <b>and</b> job satisfaction proved to have a significant positive effect on the intention to stay. ...|$|R

5|$|At the conference, {{in light}} of the little {{information}} available on Egyptian dispositions <b>and</b> <b>intentions,</b> and due to a shortage of infantry and artillery, the commanders agreed they could not relieve the surrounded strongpoints on the canal in the near future. There was a general consensus to attack Egyptian forces throwing them off balance, but disagreed on how to do so. Southern Command expected to have 640 tanks on Monday October 8, of which 530 tanks would be distributed among three divisions: 200 tanks under Adan, 180 under Sharon, and 150 under Mandler after part of his losses were replaced. Estimates put the number of Egyptian tanks at 400, when there were in fact 800 tanks across the canal by Sunday evening. In light of the apparent superiority, Gonen recommended a frontal attack at night with Adan's 162nd Division crossing to the west bank at El-Qantarah and Sharon's 143rd Division crossing into Suez City. Adan however, lacking infantry, urged a cautious approach until more reserves reached the front.|$|E
5|$|Because the South Korean {{forces had}} {{suffered}} nearly 45,000 casualties {{at the end}} of 1950, most of the South Korean units were composed of raw recruits with little combat training. After inspecting the front just days before the battle, General J. Lawton Collins, the US Army Chief of Staff, concluded that most of the ROK formations were only fit for outpost duties. At the same time, the US Eighth Army was also suffering from low morale due to its earlier defeats, and most of its soldiers were anticipating an evacuation from Korea. The Eighth Army's lack of will to fight and to maintain contact with Chinese forces resulted in a lack of information on Chinese troop movements <b>and</b> <b>intentions.</b> After inspecting the front on December 27, Ridgway ordered the US I and IX Corps to organize a new defensive line around Koyang to Uijeongbu, called the Seoul Bridgehead line, to cover the Han River crossings in case the UN forces were forced to evacuate Seoul.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{largely the}} {{fighting}} went {{in favour of}} the Allies, and finally the Japanese assault ground to a halt. Despite forcing a contraction of the Australian forces defending the beachhead, on 21 October the Japanese withdrew from Siki Cove, although the fighting around Katika continued for four more days as the Japanese attempted to retake it. Fierce resistance from the 2/28th halted them and eventually the attack was called off on 24 October, with the Japanese having suffered heavily due to tactical deficiencies, poor co-ordination and operational security, {{and a lack of}} artillery. Meanwhile, the Allied response was hampered by poor working relationships at some of the highest levels between Australian and US commanders– particularly between I Corps commander Lieutenant General Edmund Herring and the VII Amphibious Force commander Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey– the lack of a unified command structure, over cautiousness amongst naval staff, and a poor appreciation of overall Japanese strength <b>and</b> <b>intentions</b> by the highest level of the Allied command who failed to send reinforcements until it was almost too late.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to develop a conceptual model to investigate employees 2 ̆ 7 motivational influences on food safety performance and to examine the causal relationships among transformational leadership, organizational climate, employees 2 ̆ 7 attitude <b>and</b> <b>intention</b> to follow safe food handling practices in foodservice establishments utilizing leadership theory, organizational climate, and the theory of planned behavior. Questionnaires were distributed to restaurants in the U. S. Descriptive analysis, confirmative factor analysis, structural equation modeling techniques, and multi-group analysis were employed. The results {{of this study indicate that}} transformational leadership did not statistically impact employees 2 ̆ 7 attitude <b>and</b> <b>intention</b> to follow safe food handling practices. However, transformational leadership significantly impacted organizational climate. Organizational climate significantly impacted employees 2 ̆ 7 attitude <b>and</b> <b>intention</b> to follow safe food handling practices. Employees 2 ̆ 7 attitude significantly impacted intention to perform safe food handling practices. Food handling certification had a significantly different effect on the relationships among organizational climate, employees 2 ̆ 7 attitude <b>and</b> <b>intention</b> to follow safe food handling practices. In other words, organizational climate has a significantly strong impact on attitude <b>and</b> <b>intention</b> of employees with no certification.

5|$|Henry's precise motivations <b>and</b> <b>intentions</b> {{over the}} coming years are not widely agreed on. Henry himself, {{at least in the}} early part of his reign, was a devout and well-informed Catholic to the extent that his 1521 {{publication}} Assertio Septem Sacramentorum ("Defence of the Seven Sacraments") earned him the title of Fidei Defensor (Defender of the Faith) from Pope Leo X. The work represented a staunch defence of papal supremacy, albeit one couched in somewhat contingent terms. It is not clear exactly when Henry changed his mind on the issue as he grew more intent on a second marriage. Certainly, by 1527 he had convinced himself that in marrying Catherine, his brother's wife, he had acted contrary to Leviticus 20:21, an impediment Henry now believed that the Pope never had the authority to dispense with. It was this argument Henry took to Pope Clement VII in 1527 in the hope of having his marriage to Catherine annulled, forgoing at least one less openly defiant line of attack. In going public, all hope of tempting Catherine to retire to a nunnery or otherwise stay quiet were lost. Henry sent his secretary, William Knight, to appeal directly to the Holy See by way of a deceptively worded draft papal bull. Knight was unsuccessful; the Pope could not be misled so easily.|$|E
