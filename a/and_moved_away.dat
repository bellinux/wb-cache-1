5|$|As Darby {{approached}} Hawaii on July21, {{a tropical}} storm watch was issued for Hawaii County and Maui County. These were modified to tropical storm warnings by noon the next day. A tropical storm watch was issued for Oahu late on July22 as Darby continued to move closer to Hawaii, and was modified to {{a tropical storm}} warning the next morning. Eventually, after Darby made landfall in Kaʻū District in the afternoon of July23, the tropical storm warning was extended to all islands {{in the state of}} Hawaii. The watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Darby weakened <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> from the islands, with none remaining by July25.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{analysis}} from Météo-France (MFR), a disturbance in the Indian Ocean {{intertropical convergence zone}} became evident south of the Chagos Archipelago on February6, after Cyclone Geralda struck Madagascar <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> from the region. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed it as developing a day prior in the same general area. Later on February6, a circulation developed concurrently with an area of organized convection. On February8, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Hollanda as it moved southwestward, its motion influenced by a ridge to its south. A trough turned the storm to the south-southwest, and Hollanda intensified into a tropical cyclone– the equivalence of a hurricane– on February9.|$|E

5|$|Chief Tenaya and his Ahwahneechee were {{eventually}} captured and their village burned; they were removed to a reservation near Fresno, California. The chief {{and some others}} were later {{allowed to return to}} Yosemite Valley. In the spring of 1852 they attacked a group of eight gold miners, and then moved east to flee law enforcement. Near Mono Lake, they took refuge with the nearby Mono tribe of Paiute. They stole horses from their hosts <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>away,</b> but the Mono Paiutes tracked down and killed many of the Ahwahneechee, including Chief Tenaya. The Mono Paiute took the survivors as captives back to Mono Lake and absorbed them into the Mono Lake Paiute tribe.|$|E
5|$|In about 1829, Samuel Miller and {{his brother}} John opened a store on the north {{bank of the river}} at the forks. In 1830, they {{enlarged}} their store and began to operate it as a tavern in competition with the Wolf Point Tavern. On June 2, 1829 Samuel Miller and Archibald Clybourn had been authorized to operate the first ferry across the Chicago River. Clybourn was the ferry man, crossing the North Branch of the river between Miller's tavern and the Wolf Point Tavern. In 1831 John Miller built a log house near his brother's tavern that he used as a tannery; Chicago's first recorded factory. Samuel Miller sold the tavern <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> following the death of his wife in 1832.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for the arrival of}} Marty, classes were suspended in Acapulco and the Costa Grande region. The Mexican Navy was put on standby to deal with incidents occurring within the zones of Chiapas, Guerrero, Michoacan and Jalisco. The Government of Mexico issued multiple watches and warnings for coastal communities across Guerrero; by 21:00UTC (4p.m.CDT) on September28, a tropical storm watch was in effect for west of Lázaro Cárdenas to Punta San Telmo, a tropical storm warning for Acapulco to east of Tecpán de Galeana, and a hurricane warning for Tecpán de Galeana to Lázaro Cárdenas. These were discontinued as Marty weakened <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> from the region; all had been cancelled by early on September30.|$|E

5|$|Loch Leven Castle is {{a ruined}} castle {{on an island}} in Loch Leven, in the Perth and Kinross local {{authority}} area of Scotland. Possibly built around 1300, the castle was the location of military action during the Wars of Scottish Independence (1296–1357). In {{the latter part of}} the 14th century, the castle was granted by his uncle to William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas, and remained in Douglas' hands for the next 300 years. Mary, Queen of Scots was imprisoned here in 1567–1568, and forced to abdicate as queen, before escaping with the help of her gaoler's family. In 1588, the Queen's gaoler inherited the title Earl of Morton, <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> from the castle. It was bought, in 1675, by Sir William Bruce, who used the castle as a focal point in his garden; it was never again used as a residence.|$|E
5|$|On July20, the Government of Mexico {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch {{for a portion of}} the southwestern Mexico coast from Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco; this watch remained posted until the early hours of July21. Several hours later, another tropical storm watch was issued for coastal areas of the Baja California Peninsula from Agua Blanca to Buenavista, and was later upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} warning as Dora neared the coast. However, the warning was lifted after the hurricane weakened <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> from land. In Guerrero, the threat of flooding prompted the state government to prepare 900shelters, while boaters were ordered to exercise caution due to rough seas generated by the nearby tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|The South Indian {{convergence}} zone spawned a circulation that organized into a tropical {{depression in the}} Mozambique Channel on January9. It gradually intensified while moving to the southwest, developing spiral rainbands. On January11, Elinah passed between Anjouan and Mohéli in the Comoros archipelago. The next day, JTWC upgraded the storm to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane, although land interaction with Mozambique weakened Elinah. After it turned to the south <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> from the coast, the storm re-intensified, and MFR estimated Elinah reached peak winds of 115km/h (70mph) on January14. Subsequently, the {{convergence zone}} caused the storm to weaken, ultimately absorbing it by January16.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} western coast of Africa on September26, quickly spawning {{an area of}} low pressure. Upon {{the formation of the}} low, the wave split into two pieces and a second area of low pressure developed along the southern portion of the wave as it traveled west. The northern low quickly developed, spawning Tropical Depression Fourteen on September28. The southern low attached to the wave failed to develop <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> from the intensifying tropical depression. It continued through the Atlantic, entering the Pacific Ocean, after crossing Central America, on October8. A broad area of low pressure accompanied by showers and thunderstorms developed along the wave around 275miles (440kilometres) south of Acapulco, Mexico. However, the low remained disorganized because of strong upper-level winds. On October13, the low became better organized due to a relaxation in the shear. The low developed enough convection late on October14 to be declared Tropical Depression Fifteen-E while located about 435mi (705km) southwest of Colima, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|His father, Niccolò Polo, a merchant, traded {{with the}} Near East, {{becoming}} wealthy and achieving great prestige.

In 1260, Niccolò and Maffeo, while residing in Constantinople, then {{the capital of the}} Latin Empire, foresaw a political change; they liquidated their assets into jewels <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>away.</b> According to The Travels of Marco Polo, they passed through much of Asia, and met with Kublai Khan, a Mongol ruler and founder of the Yuan dynasty. Their decision to leave Constantinople proved timely. In 1261 Michael VIII Palaiologos, the ruler of the Empire of Nicaea, took Constantinople, promptly burned the Venetian quarter and re-established the Eastern Roman Empire. Captured Venetian citizens were blinded, while many of those who managed to escape perished aboard overloaded refugee ships fleeing to other Venetian colonies in the Aegean Sea.|$|E
