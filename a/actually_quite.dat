5|$|In {{the upper}} Vistula basin, where the Przeworsk culture {{settlements}} were still relatively dense {{in the first}} half of the 5th century, they are markedly absent during the second half of it. This is also the case in Silesia - the depopulation pattern began there earlier and the latest finds are dated around 400 AD. All of it agrees well with the information given by Procopius of Caesarea, according to whom the Heruli returning to Scandinavia from the Carpathian Basin in 512, heading towards the Varni tribe area in Germany, crossed a large region devoid of human settlements - presumably Silesia and Lusatia. Likewise there are no settlements found in Masovia and Podlasie beyond the early part of the 5th century. On the other hand, in central Poland and Greater Poland isolated remnants from the Roman era cultures continue to be located through the end of 5th and even into the earlier parts of the 6th century. Still further north, in Pomerania, such findings are <b>actually</b> <b>quite</b> numerous, including many cult coin deposit sites (Roman and then Byzantine golden solidi). That's where the Germanic groups lasted the longest (and kept up trade and other contacts with their brethren elsewhere).|$|E
25|$|Though Arius {{was also}} accused by his opponents {{of being too}} liberal, and too loose in his theology, {{engaging}} in heresy (as defined by his opponents), some historians argue that Arius was <b>actually</b> <b>quite</b> conservative, and that he deplored how, in his view, Christian theology was being too freely mixed with Greek paganism.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the simple}} {{appearance}} of the equations they are <b>actually</b> <b>quite</b> complicated. Given a specified distribution of matter and {{energy in the form}} of a stress–energy tensor, the EFE are understood to be equations for the metric tensor , as both the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature depend on the metric in a complicated nonlinear manner. In fact, when fully written out, the EFE are a system of ten coupled, nonlinear, hyperbolic-elliptic partial differential equations.|$|E

25|$|A {{basic problem}} with this {{explanation}} is that the Serrano decision and school finance equalization were <b>actually</b> <b>quite</b> popular among California voters. It is true that Californians who voted for Proposition 13 were less likely than other voters to support school finance, but Proposition 13 supporters were not more likely to oppose the Serrano decision, and on average they were typically supportive of both the Serrano decision and of school finance equalization.|$|E
25|$|Sri Ramana led {{a modest}} and renunciate life. However, {{according}} to David Godman, {{who has written}} extensively about Ramana, a popular image of him as a person who {{spent most of his time}} doing nothing except sitting silently in samadhi is highly inaccurate. From the period when an Ashram began to rise around him after his mother arrived, until his later years when his health failed, Ramana was <b>actually</b> <b>quite</b> active in Ashram activities such as cooking and stitching leaf plates.|$|E
25|$|A sister {{process to}} the {{synchrotron}} radiation is the inverse-Compton process, {{in which the}} relativistic electrons interact with ambient photons and Thomson scatter them to high energies. Inverse-Compton emission from radio-loud sources {{turns out to be}} particularly important in X-rays, and, because it depends only on the density of electrons, a detection of inverse-Compton scattering allows a somewhat model-dependent estimate of the energy densities in the particles and magnetic fields. This has been used to argue that many powerful sources are <b>actually</b> <b>quite</b> near the minimum-energy condition.|$|E

25|$|Butterbean {{appeared}} in the film , in a public stunt: an arranged fight with Johnny Knoxville in a department store. After the fight began, Knoxville fell, got up, was asked by Butterbean to hit him at least once. Knoxville did so, was easily knocked to the floor by Esch, and received several stitches in his head after the encounter (the camera catches Knoxville snoring). After waking up, a groggy Knoxville jokingly asked if Butterbean survived the fight. Knoxville stated that Esch is <b>actually</b> <b>quite</b> friendly outside of the ring, despite his fearsome ringside demeanor.|$|E

25|$|In Jämtland County (including the {{province}} of Härjedalen) {{the number of people}} living outside an urban area is 34% of the total population, making Jämtland one of the largest rural regions in Scandinavia. Most people in Jämtland live in Storsjöbygden, the area around lake Storsjön which includes Jämtland's only chartered city, Östersund, founded 1786 (now including Frösön), Krokom, Ås, Svenstavik, Nälden and Jämtland's second largest town Brunflo. This region is <b>actually</b> <b>quite</b> densely populated.

25|$|There is {{an entirely}} {{different}} way to accomplish the same timing measurement, not by comparing {{the timing of the}} pulse envelopes, but timing the phase of the signals. This is <b>actually</b> <b>quite</b> easy to do in electronics, and can be displayed directly using a simple mechanical pointer. The trick to such a system is to ensure the master and slave stations are phase-coherent, which was an expensive and complex proposition during World War II. But by isolating the expensive portions of the system at the few broadcast stations, the Decca Navigation System using this technique went active in 1944, offering accuracy similar to Gee but using low-cost mechanical displays which were also much easier to use.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{principle of}} plant organization based upon auxin distribution is apical dominance, {{which means the}} auxin produced by the apical bud (or growing tip) diffuses (and is transported) downwards and inhibits the development of ulterior lateral bud growth, which would otherwise compete with the apical tip for light and nutrients. Removing the apical tip and its suppressively acting auxin allows the lower dormant lateral buds to develop, and the buds between the leaf stalk and stem produce new shoots which compete to become the lead growth. The process is <b>actually</b> <b>quite</b> complex, because auxin transported downwards from the lead shoot tip has to interact with several other plant hormones (such as strigolactones or cytokinins) in the process on various positions along the growth axis in plant body to achieve this phenomenon. This plant behavior is used in pruning by horticulturists.|$|E

25|$|Paroxysmal kinesigenic choreathetosis (PKC) {{also called}} {{paroxysmal}} kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by attacks of involuntary movements, which are triggered by sudden voluntary movements. The number of attacks can increase during puberty and decrease in a person's 20s to 30s. Involuntary movements {{can take many}} forms such as ballism, chorea or dystonia and usually only affect {{one side of the}} body or one limb in particular. This rare disorder only affects about 1 in 150,000 people with PKD accounting for 86.8% of all the types of paroxysmal dyskinesias and occurs more often in males than females. There are two types of PKD, primary and secondary. Primary PKD can be further broken down into familial and sporadic. Familial PKD, which means the individual has a family history of the disorder, is more common, but sporadic cases are also seen. Secondary PKD can be caused by many other medical conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, pseudohypoparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, central nervous system trauma, or peripheral nervous system trauma. PKD has also been linked with infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis (ICCA) syndrome, in which patients have afebrile seizures during infancy (benign familial infantile epilepsy) and then develop paroxysmal choreoathetosis later in life. This phenomenon is <b>actually</b> <b>quite</b> common, with about 42% of individuals with PKD reporting a history of afebrile seizures as a child.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960-1970s, {{research}} to further understand {{the properties of}} Seyfert galaxies was carried out. A few direct measurements of the actual sizes of Seyfert nuclei were taken, and it was established that the emission lines in NGC 1068 were produced in a region over a thousand light years in diameter. Controversy existed over whether Seyfert redshifts were of cosmological origin. Confirming estimates of the distance to Seyfert galaxies and their age were limited since their nuclei vary in brightness over a time scale of a few years; therefore arguments involving distance to such galaxies and the constant speed of light cannot always {{be used to determine}} their age. In the same time period, research had been undertaken to survey, identify and catalogue galaxies, including Seyferts. Beginning in 1967, Benjamin Markarian published lists containing a few hundred galaxies distinguished by their very strong ultraviolet emission, with measurements on the position of some of them being improved in 1973 by other researchers. At the time, it was believed that 1% of spiral galaxies are Seyferts. By 1977, it was found that very few Seyfert galaxies are ellipticals, most of them being normal or barred spiral galaxies. During the same time period, efforts have been made to gather spectrophotometric data for Seyfert galaxies. It became obvious that not all spectra from Seyfert galaxies look the same, so they have been subclassified according to the characteristics of their emission spectra. A simple division into types I and II has been devised, with the classes depending on the relative width of their emission lines. It has been later noticed that some Seyfert nuclei show intermediate properties, resulting in their being further subclassified into types 1.2, 1.5, 1.8 and 1.9 (see Classification). Early surveys for Seyfert galaxies were biased in counting only the brightest representatives of this group. More recent surveys that count galaxies with low-luminosity and obscured Seyfert nuclei suggest that the Seyfert phenomenon is <b>actually</b> <b>quite</b> common, occurring in 16%nbsp&±nbsp&5% of galaxies; indeed, several dozen galaxies exhibiting the Seyfert phenomenon exist in the close vicinity (≈27 Mpc) of our own galaxy. Seyfert galaxies form a substantial fraction of the galaxies appearing in the Markarian catalog, a list of galaxies displaying an ultraviolet excess in their nuclei.|$|E
