5|$|When The Daily Californian {{published}} {{excerpts from}} the Argonne letter on June 11, the DOE obtained {{a court order to}} prevent further publication. Undeterred, The Daily Californian published the letter in its entirety on June 13. In September, the DOE declared the Hansen letter to be classified and obtained <b>a</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>restraining</b> <b>order</b> prohibiting The Daily Californian from publishing it, but the Hansen letter was published by the Madison Press Connection on September 16.

5|$|However, the court's {{role was}} to rule on whether {{publication}} was legal, not whether it was wise. In keeping with the usual practice of keeping <b>a</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>restraining</b> <b>order</b> in effect for as short a time as possible, Warren ordered that hearings be held on a preliminary injunction in one week's time, on March 16. At the request of both parties, this was postponed to March 26 so they would have time to file their briefs and affidavits. The parties were therefore back in court again on March 26 for {{a hearing on the}} government's request for a preliminary injunction. Warren decided not to hold an evidentiary hearing at which the opposing teams of experts could be cross examined. He also declined a suggestion by the Federation of American Scientists in its amicus curiae brief that a panel of experts be charged with examining the issue. The case relied on written affidavits and briefs, and the opposing counsels' oral arguments.|$|E
5|$|After their 2010 separation, Berry and Aubry became {{involved}} in a highly publicized custody battle, centered primarily on Berry's desire to move with their daughter from Los Angeles, where Berry and Aubry resided, to France, the home of French actor Olivier Martinez, whom Berry had started dating in 2010 after they met while filming Dark Tide in South Africa. Aubry objected to the move {{on the grounds that}} it would interfere with their joint custody arrangement. In November 2012, a judge denied Berry's request to move the couple's daughter to France in light of Aubry's objections. Less than two weeks later, on November 22, 2012, Aubry and Martinez were both treated at a hospital for injuries after engaging in a physical altercation at Berry's residence. Martinez performed a citizen's arrest on Aubry, and because it was considered a domestic violence incident, was granted a temporary emergency protective order preventing Aubry from coming within 100 yards of Berry, Martinez, the child with whom he shares custody with Berry, until November 29, 2012. In turn, Aubry obtained <b>a</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>restraining</b> <b>order</b> against Martinez on November 26, 2012, asserting that the fight began when Martinez threatened to kill Aubry if he did not allow the couple to move to France. Leaked court documents included photos showing significant injuries to Aubry's face, which were widely displayed in the media.|$|E
