25|$|Aneutronic fusion loses much of {{its energy}} as light. This energy results from the {{acceleration}} and deceleration of charged particles.

The radiation can be estimated using the Larmor formula <b>and</b> <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> the X-ray, IR, UV and visible spectrum. Some of the energy radiated as X-rays may be converted directly to electricity. Because of the photoelectric effect, X-rays passing through an array of conducting foils transfer some of their energy to electrons, which can then be captured electrostatically. Since X-rays can go through far greater material thickness than electrons, many hundreds or thousands of layers are needed to absorb the X-rays.|$|E
