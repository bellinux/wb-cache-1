40|$|The {{objective}} of this research study is to investigate how the tax rules and regulations applicable to agriculture affect the optimality for agriculture decision making. The study examines such issues as how the cash method of accounting affects the optimal timing for economic transactions, how the opportunity to convert ordinary tax deductions into long-term capital gains affect the optimal strategy for choosing raised pigs for breeding purposes and how the <b>alternative</b> <b>minimum</b> income <b>tax</b> rules restrict the benefits of designated tax rules and regulations. This examination also provides insights as to what types of accounting information is needed to support the agriculture decision making process. ^ The research study uses the principles of Multiperiod Linear Programming to construct a series of decision models for this investigation. These decision models allow revenue to be earned from either a corn or hog production operation. The statistical data {{used for this study}} are provided by a thesis conducted by Neal Stanley and statistics maintained by the Agriculture Extension Services at the University of Nebraska. The various decision models are used to examine how (1) the initial state, (2) the use of expected values, (3) inflation, (4) the assumptions for computing borrowing capacity, and (5) the choice of objective functions affect the optimality for agricultural decision making. ^ The solutions for the various decision models demonstrate that the tax law introduces biases which can modify the optimality for agriculture decision making, that deferred taxes are a source of capital for conducting agriculture operations, and that the <b>alternative</b> <b>minimum</b> income <b>tax</b> rules restrict the benefits provided by specific tax rules. The manner in which these various tax rules affect the optimality of decision making depends upon the non-tax parameter for the decision making process. The interaction between the tax and non-tax parameters introduces interperiod dependency for the decision making process. Moreover, the tax law also introduces interdependency between decisions which would not exist except for the tax law. These findings suggest that the tax law creates a need to use mathematical tools which allow the consideration of various decisions at various points of time simultaneously. Thus, the development of multi-period linear programming may improve the relevance and reliability of accounting information. ...|$|R
40|$|Our federal {{government}} annually donates more than $ 75 billion in potential revenue to the States under section 164 of the Tax Code, the provision allowing itemizing taxpayers to deduct {{the cost of}} the state and local income, property, and sales taxes they paid during the tax year. This Article argues that expenditure may be a massive mistake. The deduction is, in theory, supposed to further federalism, by shifting revenues [...] and therefore regulation [...] downwards from the {{federal government}} to states and their local subsidiaries. What few commentators seem yet to have recognized, though, is that using the deduction for that end, rather than some other fiscal tool, may have the perverse effect of undermining the efficiency, transparency, and even the democratic character of those local governments. The eye-popping size of the $ 75 billion number makes section 164 a perennial issue in tax policy circles, and, as one of the deductions omitted from the <b>Alternative</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>Tax’s</b> parallel tax universe, the section is also a key component of debates about the AMT. Recent Bush administration rumblings that the deduction may be on their agenda for reform, even aside from any possible AMT fix, make a reconsideration of section 164 especially timely. It has been almost a decade since the last major legal academic examination of the merits of the deduction. This Article begins, humbly, by attempting to update that earlier work with recent developments, such as our expanded understanding of the limits of taxpayers’ capacity to analyze their own economic situation, and the need for more cooperative tax enforcement in a “flatter” world. The Article proposes a novel justification for the deduction, based on my claim that cognitive biases and other factors in the political economy of taxation would, absent the deduction, prevent states from sharing the burden of tax enforcement with the federal government. More generally, however, my goal here is to show that section 164 is about more than (boatloads of) money. Other commentators, especially economists, have recognized that the deduction may shift the locus of regulation from federal to state and local governments. In this Article I argue that the deduction may play a large but currently underappreciated role not only in the relative sizes of local and federal governments but also in the structure and effectiveness of sub-national governments. Local governments develop in response both to direct political demands and also the indirect pressure generated by the threat of “exit,” or out-migration to a more efficient or more responsive jurisdiction. The deduction, I argue, significantly affects both of these factors [...] most obviously by reducing exit pressures, but also by in more subtle ways transforming the processes of direct politics. Thus, what we should think about section 164 depends on much more than the bottom of a balance sheet. Any fully considered judgment must include our philosophy of mind, our plan for the individual states’ place in an international marketplace, and our optimal design for good local government. Seventy-five billion? That’s nothin’...|$|R

Comprehensive {{universal access}} to health insurance may {{not be on the}} minds of American families, but it captivates the likes of Michael Moore who prefer Cuban-style health care to American. The fascination extends beyond Hollywood. It is also high on the “To Do ” list of the Democratic congressional leadership. A pattern seems to be emerging regarding proposed health care legislation: Create a new health care entitlement for low-income and middle-class children and their parents with annual family incomes up to $ 82, 600. Ironically tens of thousands of these families who take up the new entitlement would then have to pay the <b>Alternative</b> <b>Minimum</b> Income <b>Tax,</b> a 1989 federal law targeting tax loopholes for the wealthy. 1 At the same time, the Democratic Party is proposing to lower the age for Medicare, the health care entitlement for seniors, with the hope of eventually creating a federal “Medicare for all” program. Moreover, they are actively involved in dismantling effective strategies that model private sector and competitive initiatives within the entitlement programs. The current social and political climate seems inauspiciously reminiscent of the early 90 ’s – the last time there was a national discussion over solutions to a health care delivery. But there is one big difference this time: the bargaining chip is the family, starting with insurance for children in middle-class families!

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{proposals for}} the reform of the U. S. system of taxing cross-border income including dividend exemption, full current inclusion, a Japanese type version of dividend exemption with an effective tax rate test subject to an exception for an active business, dividend exemption combined with a <b>minimum</b> <b>tax,</b> and repeal of check-the-box. We consider two versions of dividend exemption with a minimum tax: {{one in which the}} <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> is imposed on a country by country basis and another in which the <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> is based on overall foreign income. In addition we evaluate versions of <b>minimum</b> <b>taxes</b> that allow current deductions for tangible investment against the <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> base. To compare these schemes with current law, we reevaluate the efficiency cost of the dividend repatriation tax using evidence from the response to the 2005 repatriation tax holiday. We find that the burden of avoiding repatriations is higher than found in previous estimates, particularly for high tech profitable foreign businesses, and rises as deferrals accumulate. We simulate the effect of the various alternatives on effective tax rates for investment in high and low tax countries with inclusion of the importance of parent developed intangibles and their role in shifting income from the United States. Our analysis demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} make improvements to the system across many dimensions including the lockout effect, income shifting, the choice of location and complexity. The goals are not necessarily in conflict. Compared to the other schemes, we find the per country <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> with expensing for real investment has many advantages with respect to these margins. The per country <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> offsets (at least in part) the increased incentives for income shifting under pure dividend exemption and is better than full inclusion in tailoring companies' effective tax rates to their competitive position abroad. No U. S. tax burden will fall on companies that earn just a normal return abroad. The <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> is basically a tax on large excess returns in low tax locations, cases in which the company probably has less intense foreign competition. The investment will still be made. Unlike the Japanese type dividend exemption alternative considered, there is no cliff in which the income is subject to the full home country rate if it fails the <b>minimum</b> effective <b>tax</b> rate and active business test. Under the <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> with no cliff the company has more of an incentive to lower foreign taxes and will often prefer paying the U. S. <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> to paying a higher foreign <b>tax.</b> Finally, the <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> with expensing is more effective in discouraging income shifting than repeal of check-the-box. In summary, the per country <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> with expensing combines the advantages of the extreme alternatives, dividend exemption and full inclusion, and reduces their shortcomings. Our comparison of the overall and per country <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> suggests that the overall version deserves serious consideration. While it is not as thorough as the per country <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> in targeting tax haven income, it is a substantial move in that direction and is much simpler...|$|R
