40|$|Abstract—Modern {{parallel}} {{and distributed}} applications {{have a wide}} range of communication characteristics and performance requirements. These diverse characteristics affect the performance and suitability of particular routing <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> policies in multihop point-to-point networks. In this paper, we identify a core set of architectural features necessary for flexible selection and implementation of multiple routing <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> schemes. Using this, we present a flexible router whose routing <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> policies can be tailored to the application, allowing the network to meet these diverse needs. By dedicating a small programmable processor to each incoming link, we can implement wormhole, virtual cut-through, <b>and</b> packet <b>switching,</b> as well as hybrid switching schemes, each under a variety of unicast and multicast routing algorithms. In addition, a flexible router can support several applications or traffic types simultaneously, enabling better support of applications with multiple traffic classes. We have designed, implemented, and fabricated the Programmable Routing Controller (PRC). Cycle-level simulations of mesh-connected PRCs also demonstrate that flexible routing <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> can significantly enhance application performance.

Together these practices constitute illegal bait <b>and</b> <b>switch.</b> Is this phenomenon necessarily harmful to consumers and to the economy? We show that bait <b>and</b> <b>switch</b> can benefit consumers because utility is created through in-store promotions and price competition is enhanced.

40|$|Context-aware {{applications}} monitor {{changes in}} their environment <b>and</b> <b>switch</b> their behaviour {{in order to continue}} satisfying requirements. Specifying monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> in such applications can be difficult due to their dependence on varying environmental properties. Two problems require analysis: the detection of changes in the operating environment to assess their impact on requirements satisfaction, and the adaptation of application behaviour to ensure requirements satisfaction. This thesis borrows from the world of problem-oriented software system development and product-lines to analyse monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> problems on one hand and contextual changes on the other. It proposes a shift of focus from treating monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> as activities to be analysed as part of the design, to treating them as part of the problem whose requirements are analysed. We claim three novel contributions: (1) we provide concepts and mechanisms for analysing monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> problems in context; (2) we formulate and prove two theorems for monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching,</b> which define the necessary and sufficient conditions for monitoring a contextual variable <b>and</b> for <b>switching</b> application behaviour to restore requirements satisfaction when they are violated; and (3) we provide a tool for automated derivation of the conditions for monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching.</b> Our approach is evaluated using two case studies of a proof of concept mobile phone productline and a logistics company that delivers and monitors products across the UK. We found the applications of the approach to be effective in analysing unforeseen requirements violations caused by changes in the systems operating environments. Furthermore, the monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> mechanisms derived from the analysis enabled the software to become, to some extent, context-aware.

Specifying monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> in such applications can be difficult due to their dependence on varying environmental properties. Two problems require analysis: the monitoring of environmental properties to assess their impact on continual requirements satisfaction, and the selection of appropriate behaviours that ensure requirements satisfaction. To address these problems, we provide concepts for refining contextual properties which we then use to formulate two theorems for monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching.</b> These enable us to formally analyse the impact of context on monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> problems. We have instantiated our general approach by encoding monitoring <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> problems into propositional logic constraints, which we analyse automatically using a standard SAT solver. The approach is applied to an industrial case study to assess its efficacy.
