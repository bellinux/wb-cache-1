40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that {{additional}} information can be gained on time series by investigating their associated complex networks. In this work, we investigate the multifractal property and Laplace spectrum of the horizontal visibility graphs (HVGs) constructed from fractional Brownian motions. We aim to identify via simulation and curve fitting the form of these properties in terms of the Hurst index H. First, we use the sandbox algorithm to study the multifractality of these HVGs. It is found that multifractality exists in these HVGs. We find that the average fractal dimension 〈 D(0) 〉 of HVGs approximately satisfies the prominent linear formula 〈 D(0) 〉 = 2 - H; while the average information dimension 〈 D(1) 〉 and average correlation dimension 〈 D(2) 〉 are all approximately bi-linear functions of H when H> 0. 15. Then, we calculate the spectrum and energy for the general Laplacian operator and normalized Laplacian operator of these HVGs. We find that, for the general Laplacian operator, the <b>average</b> <b>logarithm</b> of second-smallest eigenvalue 〈 (u_ 2) 〉, the <b>average</b> <b>logarithm</b> of third-smallest eigenvalue 〈 (u_ 3) 〉, and the <b>average</b> <b>logarithm</b> of maximum eigenvalue 〈 (u_n) 〉 of these HVGs are approximately linear functions of H; while the average Laplacian energy 〈 E_nL〉 is approximately a quadratic polynomial function of H. For the normalized Laplacian operator, 〈 (u_ 2) 〉 and 〈 (u_ 3) 〉 of these HVGs approximately satisfy linear functions of H; while 〈 (u_n) 〉 and 〈 E_nL〉 are approximately a 4 th and cubic polynomial function of H respectively.

Reconstructed muon tracks allow investigation of muon pseudorapidity (η) distributions. These distributions are nearly identical to the pseudorapidity distributions of their parent mesons produced in hadronic interactions. Comparison of the η distributions from measured and simulated showers can be used to test the quality of the high energy hadronic interaction models.

Investigators, in studies demonstrating the usefulness of bright light therapy, also have implicated light's role in non-seasonal depression. The precise cause of postpartum depression has not been delineated, but it seemed possible that new mothers would spend reduced time in daylight. The goal {{of this study was}} to examine the levels of illumination experienced by postpartum mothers and to discover any relationship between light exposure and mood levels experienced during the postpartum period. Methods Fifteen postpartum women, who did not have any baseline indication of depression, wore a wrist device (Actillume) for 72 hours to measure their exposure to light. At the end of the recording period, they completed a self-reported measure of mood. The mean light exposure of these postpartum women (expressed as the 24 -hour <b>average</b> <b>logarithm</b> of illumination in lux) was compared with that of a representative sample of women of comparable age, residence, and seasonal months of recording. Mood levels were then rank-ordered and tested for correlation with light exposure levels. Results There was no significant difference between the amount of light [log 10 lux] experienced by postpartum (1. 01 SD 0. 236) and control women (1. 06 SD 0. 285). Mood was not correlated with illumination in the postpartum sample. Conclusions Postpartum women in San Diego did not receive reduced light, nor was low mood related to low illumination. </p...|$|E

DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative case series. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven patients (9 female, 2 male; average age, 57 +/- 3 years) with spontaneous retinal detachment due to macular hole. All patients had a myopia higher than - 10. 0 D {{and had no}} proliferative vitreoretinopathy and no history of trauma. The average myopia amounted to - 17. 7 +/- 1. 1 D, and in eight cases, a large posterior staphyloma was present. Follow-up was 69 +/- 17 months. INTERVENTION: Patients underwent pars plana vitrectomy, temporary silicone oil tamponade, and laser photocoagulation of the macular hole rim. Silicone oil removal was performed after 2. 8 +/- 0. 8 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anatomic attachment of the retina was determined and visual acuity was measured.

Methods: The authors performed a retrospective study of 80 consecutive cases of rhegmato genous retinal detachment from January 2009 to December 2011 treated by scleral buckling surgery. Two groups of patients were defined according to inpatient (group 1) or outpatient (group 2) surgery, and {{a comparison of}} several parameters between these two groups was performed. Results: Of the 80 subjects in this study, {{the average age of}} group 1 (50 patients) was 49. 7 years, and that of group 2 (30 patients) was 47. 5 years. There were no statistically significant differences in the <b>average</b> <b>logarithm</b> of the minimum angle of resolution-visual acuity, the condition of the lens, or the presence of retinal lattice degeneration prior to the surgery between the groups. There were no statistically significant differences in the patterns of tear or retinal detachment or in surgical procedure between the groups.

Visual acuity data from the two charts were analyzed with Bland-Altman plot to determine the limits of agreement. The Wilcoxon signed test was performed in children aged 3 - 4 years and in children aged 5 - 6 years separately to evaluate the influence of age. The inter-eye {{difference between the two}} charts were further analyzed with the paired t-test. A p value < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 47 children were enrolled for the study. The <b>average</b> <b>logarithm</b> of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) monocular visual acuity with Lea symbols (0. 17 ± 0. 13) was better than the Bailey-Lovie tumbling E chart (0. 22 ± 0. 14). The mean difference between Bailey-Lovie tumbling E chart and Lea symbol chart was 0. 05 ± 0. 12 in logMAR units. A second analysis eliminating outliers showed the same result but lower differences (n = 43, 0. 05 ± 0. 05 logMAR units). Visual acuity results between the two charts in children aged 3 - 4 years showed a significant difference (p = 0. 000), but not for children aged 5 - 6 years (p = 0. 059).

A retrospective analysis was performed on 79 eyes of 40 patients with cGVHD referred to the University of Southern California department of ophthalmology between November 2009 and July 2013 for PROSE treatment. This analysis included an assessment of ocular symptoms and visual function before and after treatment using the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) survey. Pre- and post-treatment visual acuity and clinical data were also compared. Twenty-eight male patients and 12 female patients were included in this study. The average age was 56. 1  years (range, 27 to 74). Of the 79 eyes treated, 71 (90 %) showed improved visual acuity with PROSE treatment. Fifty-seven eyes (72 %) experienced a 2 - or greater line visual acuity improvement and 14 eyes (18 %) experienced a 1 -line improvement. <b>Average</b> <b>logarithm</b> of the minimal angle of resolution improved from. 49  ± . 52 to. 16  ± . 44 (P < . 0001), which correlates to a Snellen score improvement of approximately 20 / 60 to 20 / 30.

Similarly, we aggregated the data for the subset of comprehensive states (IL-MA-RI) with initial treatment in the year 1987 when the first mandate was enacted in Massachusetts. 31 The synthetic control group is constructed as the convex combination of control states that are most similar to the states with strong coverage and comprehensive coverage with respect to various socioeconomic predictors as well as lagged values of the average age of first motherhood before treatment (i.e., before 1985 and 1987, respectively). More precisely, the predictors chosen include the following: (1) variables that control for the demographic and family structure of the female population, such as the percentage of new mothers older than 35 and the percentage of married women in the state; (2) variables that control for the state’s race composition, such as percentage of white and black females; (3) variables that control for the education level of the female population, such as the percentage of highly educated women; (4) variables related to the female labour market, such as the participation rate and employment rate, the <b>average</b> <b>logarithm</b> of the hourly wage, and the percentage of women covered by Employment Sponsored Insurance (ESI); (5) variables that control for differences in abortion laws or attitudes, such as the abortion rate per 1000 women by state of residency; and (6) several lags of average age at first birth. 32 All of these predictors are averaged over different periods to maximise the fit of the estimation. Although the predictors are roughly the same for the four estimations (strong, strong whites only, IL-MA-RI, IL-MA-RI whites only), the composition of the synthetic control group is not exactly the same.
