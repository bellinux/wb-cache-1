25|$|General George Patton, the {{commander}} of the United States Third Army and military governor of Bavaria, where most of the Jewish DPs resided, was known for pursuing a harsh, indiscriminate repatriation policy.

Joseph Dunner, an American officer who in civilian life was <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>science,</b> sent a memorandum to military authorities protesting the order.
