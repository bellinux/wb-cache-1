Euclidean {{functions}} with {{values in}} an arbitrary well-ordered set were first considered in a 1949 work of Motzkin and studied {{in more detail}} in work of Fletcher, Samuel and Nagata in the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s. Here these results are revisited, simplified, and extended. The two main themes are (i) consideration of Ord-valued functions on an Artinian poset and (ii) use of ordinal arithmetic, including the Hessenberg-Brookfield ordinal sum. In particular, to any Euclidean ring we associate an ordinal invariant, its Euclidean order type, and we initiate a study of this invariant. The main new result gives {{upper and lower bounds}} on the Euclidean order type of a finite product of Euclidean rings in terms of the Euclidean order types of the factor rings. Throughout, “a ring ” means a commutative ring with multiplicative identity. We denote by R • the set R 0 and by R × the group of units of R. We denote by N the natural numbers, including 0. When we are thinking of N as the least infinite ordinal, we denote it by ω. If S is any class equipped with a “zero element ” – here, either the least element of an ordered class or the identity element of a monoid – then we put S • = S 0.

A hypergraph is said simple if none of its edges is contained within another. A transversal (or hitting set) of H is a set T ⊆ V that intersects every edge of E. A transversal is minimal {{if it does not}} contain any other transversal as a subset. The set of all minimal transversal of H is denoted by T r(H). The hypergraph (V, T r(H)) is called the transversal hypergraph of H. Given a simple hypergraph H, the hypergraph dualization problem (Trans-Enum for short) concerns the enumeration without repetitions of T r(H).

40|$|AbstractBinary {{analysis}} {{is useful in}} many practical applications, such as the detection of malware or vulnerable software components. However, our survey of the literature shows that most existing binary analysis tools and frameworks rely on assumptions about specific compilers and compilation settings. It {{is well known that}} techniques such as refactoring and light obfuscation can significantly alter the structure of code, even for simple programs. Applying such techniques or changing the compiler and compilation settings can significantly affect the accuracy of available binary analysis tools, which severely limits their practicability, especially when applied to malware. To address these issues, we propose a novel technique that extracts the semantics of binary code in terms of both data and control flow. Our technique allows more robust binary analysis because the extracted semantics of the binary code is generally immune from light obfuscation, refactoring, and varying the compilers or compilation settings. Specifically, we apply data-flow analysis to extract the semantic flow of the registers as well as the semantic components of the control flow graph, which are then synthesized into a novel representation called the semantic flow graph (SFG). Subsequently, various properties, such as reflexive, symmetric, <b>antisymmetric,</b> and transitive <b>relations,</b> are extracted from the SFG and applied to binary analysis. We implement our system in a tool called BinGold and evaluate it against thirty binary code applications. Our evaluation shows that BinGold successfully determines the similarity between binaries, yielding results that are highly robust against light obfuscation and refactoring. In addition, we demonstrate the application of BinGold to two important binary analysis tasks: binary code authorship attribution, and the detection of clone components across program executables. The promising results suggest that BinGold can be used to enhance existing techniques, making them more robust and practical...|$|R

ND 4 DS 0 4 has considerable interest because of its ferroelectric properties: spectra were recorded at 300 K and 230 K, within the paraelectric and ferroelectric phases respectively. Symmetry relationships were used in solving the structure, particularly for refining the orientation data. At room temperature, {{the two sets of}} bisu 1 phate deuterons were found to have (within xperimental error) the same quadrupole coupling constants and asymmetry parameters: h = 191. 9 ± 3 KHz, T 1 = 0. 094 ± 0. 02 h = 193. 2 ± 3 KHz, T 1 = 0. 070 ± 0. 0 l. The quadrupolar constants appear somewhat larger than expected from the known 0 ···· 0 distances. No evidence of disorder is apparent from the room temperature data. At 230 K, both groups of deuterons appear to have suffered small angular displacements, essentially planar and <b>antisymmetric</b> with <b>relation</b> to the room temperature positions. One type of deuteron undergoes movements of larger amplitude in a plane more favourably oriented with respect to the polar axis, [Cl], which suggests a definite contribution from these deuterons to the appearance of ferroelectricity. The Curie point has been determined independently by use of the radio frequency spectrometer; a value of 266 ± 2 K was obtained, in reasonable agreement with the literature value from dielectric constant measurements. The ND 4 + group is reorienting rapidly both at 230 K and 300 K. Little change seems to occur upon transition. Some distortion of the tetrahedral structure, a possible difference in the reorientation rate for the two kinds of ND 4 + ions, and a slight difference in their respective environments could be the main causes for the fine structure observed in the ammonium resonance. The study of Sr(DCOO) 2. 2 D 2 0 gave the following average values for the quadrupolar constants and asymmetry parameters at 300 K: 2 formate ion [DC(1) 0 (1) 0 (2) ]- = 167. 6 + 3 KHz 'T] = 0. 043 ± 0. 01, DB h = 170. 3 ± 3 KHz 'T] = 0. 025 ± 0. 01. formate ion [DC(2) 0 (3) 0 (4) ]- DB= h 242. 8 + 3 KHz 'T] = O. 100 ± 0. 005 2 = 216. 8 + 3 KHz 'T] = O. 113 ± 0. 005 Both formate ions give e. f. g. tensors very close to axial symmetry. For [DC(1) 0 (1) 0 (2) ]-, the deuteron is approximately aligned with the C(1) 0 (10 (2) bisectrix in an essentially planar arrangement. For [DC(2) 0 (3) 0 (4) ]- the deuteron shows a surprising deviation of 22 ̊ from the plane of the COO group, as determined from Osaki's X-ray data.
