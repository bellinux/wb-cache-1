In 2015 and 2016 she {{organised}} the European Week of Bees and Pollination in the European Parliament. In 2016 Albert II, Prince of Monaco, was a keynote speaker. As {{part of this}} event she established the European forum of beekeepers and farmers. In 2017 she started the national campaign ‘Honey breakfast’ in schools aiming to promote the contribution of bees for biodiversity and the benefits from the consumption of honey and other <b>apiculture</b> <b>products.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{municipality}} based {{its economy}} on the commercial exchange of agricultural producers, coffee, sugar cane, bananas, citrus, fruit and agricultural resources. As {{for the transition}} is important crops cultivation of beans. The exploitation of pastures livestock owners took over 50% of the municipal territory. The honey and other <b>apiculture</b> <b>products</b> are other sources of the population. The main formal employer was the State, through the various institutions that provided services in the municipality: Municipal Government, Judiciary, Police and Health sector, financial institutions and the educational sector which generated a total of approximately 230 jobs.|$|E
40|$|The savannah {{forests in}} Adamaoua, Cameroon, {{are home to}} traditional, forest-based beekeepers, {{subsistence}} farmers and pastoralists. This sparsely populated region is economically marginal and little developed, with lower than national average incomes. Forest apiculture is important here: honey, beeswax and propolis contribute on average to 68 % of household income and have high food, medicinal and cultural value. Bees are also critical pollinators of crops and trees. Practised by 48 % {{of the population in}} Djerem Division, apiculture is a route out of poverty only for a few larger-scale beekeepers, but provides a safety net and income diversification {{for the majority of the}} 12, 000 beekeepers in the region. This savannah ecosystem has been historically subject to climatic changes. Unusual and increasing climatic variations add to human and forest vulnerability by affecting flowering seasons, pests and apiculture production. Land tenure is traditionally regulated, and the government, the formal landowner of public domain forest, is practically non-existent. Increasing <b>apiculture</b> <b>product</b> commercialization, mineral finds, dams and growing migration are transforming local perceptions of forest and land tenure and adding to already insecure livelihoods. The results of research (2004 – 2010) on how these beekeepers use the forest, their vulnerabilities and responses indicate that individual and group solutions are being bricolaged to secure livelihoods, adapt and mitigate changes. This includes formalization, collective action, product value-adding, tentative customary tenure changes and innovative new chain and market arrangements. <b>Apiculture</b> professionalization and <b>product</b> diversification are increasing the value of forest beekeeping and of revenues for men and women...|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, in {{the late}} 1980s, animal {{husbandry}} continued {{to be an important}} component of the national economy, supplying foodstuffs and raw materials for domestic consumption, for processing by industry, and for export. In 1985 there were 22,485,500 head of livestock, of which 58.9 percent were sheep; 19.1 percent, goats; 10.7 percent, cattle; 8.8 percent, horses; and 2.5 percent, camels. In addition, pigs, poultry, and bees were raised. In 1985 there were 56,100 pigs and 271,300 head of poultry; no figures were available on <b>apiculture.</b> Livestock <b>products</b> included meat and fat from camels, cattle, chickens, horses, goats, pigs and sheep; eggs; honey; milk; wool from camels, cattle, goats, and sheep; and hides and skins from camels, cattle, goats, horses, and sheep. In 1986 exports of livestock products included 15,500 tons of wool, 121,000 large hides, 1,256,000 small hides, and 44,100 tons of meat and meat products.|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the main animal products intercepted and seized by the agricultural surveillance units. This paper studied three Agricultural Surveillance Units located at land borders in the North region of Brazil: Assis Brasil and Epitaciolândia (Acre State) and Pacaraima (Roraima State), respectively borders with Peru, Bolivia and Venezuela. The main animal products confiscated were dairy products, fish, meat, sausage, veterinary products (drugs), animal food (pet foods) and <b>apiculture</b> <b>products.</b> Given the clandestine nature of animal transit and its products in these borders, the possibilities of introduction of infectious agents and diseases must be better evaluated, considering the type of products confiscated, as well as the sanitary status of the countries of origin...|$|E

The most important share of rapeseed species (especially {{in recent years}} when the cultivated areas have increased significantly, and {{this is due to}} the production of biodiesel fuels, what has made this the rape picked to become a senior, picked when in addition to the development of the bee families, and an important marketable honey production), Acacia, lime, sunflower, forage, pasture and meadows. Of particular importance in achieving constant yields of honey-a harvest of Manna sources have, coming from the secretions of plants. Honeydew honey is rich in mineral salts, popular among consumers, but it is harmful to bees embedded in the their winter reserves. Romania has more than 11 million hectares of multifarious flora, half of which is agricultural and half is logging. However 80 % of marketed production of honey in the country is provided by the varieties and hybrids of sunflower seeds, Acacia and Linden forests. Producing quality honey is a matter of prestige, the main criterion for classifying <b>apiculture</b> <b>products</b> shall become just the quality of the products delivered, the presentation, selection and varieties. </p...|$|E
