Jackson later said of [...] "Beat It", [...] "the point {{is no one}} has to be the tough guy, you can walk away from a fight and still be <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> <b>You</b> don't have to die to prove you're a man". [...] "Human Nature", co-written by Steve Porcaro of the band Toto, is moody and introspective, as conveyed in lyrics such as, [...] "Looking out, across the morning, the City's heart begins to beat, reaching out, I touch her shoulder, I'm dreaming of the street".|$|E
500|$|The {{perceived}} lack {{of remorse}} by Waddle, plus {{reports in the}} Japanese media that Greeneville had {{made no effort to}} assist Ehime Maru survivors as they waited for almost one hour for rescue angered many Japanese citizens, especially the family members of the missing. [...] One Japanese family member publicly referred to Waddle as, [...] "the most terrible criminal of them all." [...] Another family member, referring to Waddle said, [...] "If you're <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>you</b> should fall on your knees and ask for our pardon!" [...] In response, Waddle delivered letters of apology to the Japanese consulate in Hawaii for delivery to the victims' families during the last week of February.|$|E
500|$|However, Anderson {{conceded that}} Grade [...] "was not <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>you</b> could argue with. If he said [...] "No", {{you had to}} accept that he wouldn't change his mind." [...] Of Grade's decision, La Rivi√®re conjectures, [...] "No one knows what was running through [...] mind ... but given {{the ease with which}} the 'Unwinese' element could have been removed [...] the series, it seems {{probable}} that he simply didn't like a lot of what he was seeing." [...] In a move that would lead to the discontinuation of the Supermarionation format, Anderson and Grade coordinated to transfer most of the production staff from the Century 21 base at the Slough Trading Estate in Berkshire to Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire for the commencement of filming on UFO, the Andersons' first full live-action series.|$|E

500|$|Wilson {{was born}} in Winchester, Massachusetts on March 16, 1982. While he was in second grade, he moved to Londonderry, New Hampshire. Today, he talks little of his {{childhood}} except to discuss his father, Mike Wilson, who was an Air Force veteran and a demanding perfectionist. During fall, he would have Brian bag leaves and bury them in the woods; and in winter, he would have Brian spend seven hours shoveling snow on weekends. Brian said in a 2011 interview, [...] "I think that's how {{you need to be}} raised. It's not your friend, it's your dad. And he's going to be strict. And one day you're going to understand why. And sometimes, it's a little too late. They might pass away, and you might not get that chance to say thanks or understand why you did those things. But when you become <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>you</b> understand why." ...|$|E
500|$|Betrayal is the {{secondary}} theme of The Wild Bunch. [...] The characters suffer from {{their knowledge of}} having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate, thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ("$10,000 cuts {{an awful lot of}} family ties"). However, Bishop says, [...] "When you side with <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>you</b> stay with him, and if you can't do that you're like some animal." [...] Such oppositional ideas lead to the film's violent conclusion, as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable. Bishop remembers his betrayals, most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton (in flashback) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery (ostensibly to guard the hostages). Critic David Weddle writes that [...] "like that of Conrad's Lord Jim, Pike Bishop's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish." ...|$|E

2500|$|US President Theodore Roosevelt was an honored guest. Mark Twain and Henry H. Rogers {{also paid}} a visit, in the latter's yacht [...] "Kanawha". Twain's humorous talk was partly an {{introduction}} of Rear Admiral Purnell F. Harrington, former Commandant of the Norfolk Navy Yard. Said Twain, [...] "In my remarks of welcome of Admiral Harrington, I {{am not going}} to give him compliments. Compliments always embarrass <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> <b>You</b> do not know what to say. It does not inspire you with words. There is nothing you can say in answer to a compliment. I have been complimented myself a great many times, and they always embarrass me. I always feel they have not said enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|For example, {{the words}} of [...] "I'm <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> <b>You</b> Don't Meet Every Day" [...] (Roud 975) are known from a {{broadside}} in the Bodleian Library. The date is almost certainly before 1900, {{and it seems to}} be Irish. In 1958 the song was recorded in Canada (My Name is Pat and I'm Proud of That). Scottish traveler Jeannie Robertson from Aberdeen, made the next recorded version in 1961. She has changed it to make reference to [...] "Jock Stewart", one of her relatives, and there are no Irish references. In 1976 Scottish artist Archie Fisher deliberately altered the song to remove the reference to a dog being shot. In 1985 The Pogues took it full circle by restoring all the Irish references.|$|E

Rava {{interpreted the}} words of [...] "In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime; they know not the light." [...] Rava interpreted this to teach that they used to cast envious eyes on wealthy people and entrust fragrant balsam into their keeping, which they placed in their storerooms. In the evening the people of Sodom would smell it out like dogs, as [...] says, [...] "They return at evening, they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city." [...] Then they would burrow in and steal the money.|$|E

2500|$|Viewing the {{battlefield}} from horseback {{on the hill}} at Jebel Surgham, Kitchener commented: [...] "Well, we have given them a damn good dusting". As the British and Egyptians advanced in columns, the Khalifa attempted to outflank and encircle the columns; this led to desperate hand-to-hand fighting. Churchill wrote of his own experience as the 21st Lancers cut {{their way through the}} Ansar: [...] "The collision was prodigious and for perhaps ten wonderful seconds, no man heeded his enemy. Terrified horses wedged in the crowd, bruised and shaken men, sprawling in heaps, struggle dazed and stupid, to their feet, panted and looked about them". The Lancers' onslaught carried them through the 12-men-deep Ansar line [...] with the Lancers losing about 70 dead while killing hundreds of the enemy. Following the annihilation of his army, the Khalifa ordered a retreat and early in the afternoon, Kitchener rode in triumph into Omdurman and immediately ordered that the thousands of Christians enslaved by the Ansar were now all free people. Kitchener lost fewer than 500 men while killing about 11,000 and wounding 17,000 of the Ansar. Burleigh summed the general mood of the British troops: [...] "At Last! Gordon has been avenged and justified. The dervishes have been overwhelming routed, Mahdism has been [...] "smashed", while the Khalifa's capital of Omdurman has been stripped of its barbaric halo of sanctity and invulnerability." [...] Kitchener promptly had the Mahdi's tomb blown up and his bones scattered. Queen Victoria, who had wept when she heard of General Gordon's death, now wept for the man who had vanquished Gordon, asking whether it had been really necessary for Kitchener to desecrate the Mahdi's tomb. In a letter to his mother, Churchill wrote that the victory at Omdurman had been [...] "disgraced by the inhuman slaughter of the wounded and...Kitchener is responsible for this". There is no evidence that Kitchener ordered his men to shoot the wounded Ansar on the field of Omdurman, but he did give before the battle what the British journalist Mark Urban called a [...] "mixed message", saying that mercy should be given, {{while at the same time}} saying [...] "Remember Gordon" [...] and that the enemy were all [...] "murderers" [...] of Gordon. The victory at Omdurman made Kitchener into a popular war hero, and gave him a reputation for efficiency and as a man who got things done. The journalist G. W. Steevens wrote in the Daily Mail that [...] "He [...] is more like a machine than <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> <b>You</b> feel that he ought to be patented and shown with pride at the Paris International Exhibition. British Empire: Exhibit No. 1 hors concours, the Sudan Machine". The shooting of the wounded at Omdurman, along with the desecration of the Mahdi's tomb, gave Kitchener a reputation for brutality that was to dog him for the rest of his life, and posthumously.|$|E
