Roger Ebert of the Chicago Times cited it as one of the “top dozen documentaries of 2012.” His newly released novel “The Boys of Truxton” is set in Upstate New York and deals with a teenager convicted of a heinous crime. In fact, many of Lieberman’s novels appear to be set in Ithaca, New York, where he continues to live on a 135 acre farm. Ithaca frequently appears in his films, either for setting, detail, or theme. The feature comedy Green Lights, which he wrote and directed, {{is the story of a}} small town swept up into a frenzy by a location scout who is taken for a big film producer. His film Last Stop Kew Gardens is a personal exploration in which he returns to the “small town” within the city of Queens, New York, where he was raised, the child of refugees from Hitler’s Vienna. In Faces in a Famine Lieberman goes to Ethiopia during the height of the famine and provides a novelist’s eye view of the people who descended on the scene, the relief workers, the press and the “disaster groupies.” ...|$|R
