5|$|Grown on <b>agar</b> <b>plates,</b> the mycelia of A.serialiformis and A.serialis have {{identical}} chemical reactivity, and {{are rather}} similar in appearance, although the authors {{note that the}} former's was more cottony than the latter's. The authors mated several combinations of North American collections using vegetative compatibility tests, and confirmed the presence of different mating alleles—indicating {{that all of the}} North American collections represented a single species. Similar pairings performed between North American and European collections showed the species to be incompatible, and therefore distinct.|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, {{bacteria}} are usually grown using solid or liquid media. Solid growth media, such as <b>agar</b> <b>plates,</b> {{are used to}} isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain. However, liquid growth media are used when measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required. Growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension, making the cultures easy to divide and transfer, although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult. The use of selective media (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or with antibiotics added) can help identify specific organisms.|$|E
25|$|Another type plating out organisms, next to streaking, on <b>agar</b> <b>plates</b> is {{the spot}} {{analysis}}. This type of analysis {{is often used}} to check the viability of cells and performed with pinners (often also called froggers). A third used technique is the use of sterile, glass, beads to plate out cells. In this technique cells are grown in a liquid culture of which a small volume is pipetted on the agar plate and then spread out with the sterile, glass beads. Replicate plating is another technique in order to plate out cells on <b>agar</b> <b>plates.</b> These four techniques are the most used ones, but others are also possible. It is crucial to work in a sterile manner in order to prevent contamination on the <b>agar</b> <b>plates.</b> Plating is thus often done in a laminar flow cabinet or on the working bench next to a bunsen burner.|$|E

25|$|<b>Agar</b> <b>plates</b> {{may also}} be {{indicator}} plates, in which the organisms are not {{selected on the basis}} of growth, but are instead distinguished by a color change in some colonies, typically caused by the action of an enzyme on some compound added to the medium.|$|E
25|$|H. larsenii is {{resistant}} to the following antibiotics: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, neomycin, penicillin G, rifampicin, streptomycin, and tetracycline.

Antibiotic sensitivity and resistance was determined using the agar diffusion test in which paper discs saturated with antibiotics were placed on <b>agar</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tryptic (trypticase) soy agar (TSA) is a {{general-purpose}} medium {{produced by}} enzymatic digestion of soybean meal and casein. It is frequently the base medium of other agar types; for example, blood <b>agar</b> <b>plates</b> {{are made by}} enriching TSA plates with blood.

40|$|Background: Strongyloides stercoralis is {{a common}} {{parasitic}} nematode in Iran, especially in north of the country. The early {{diagnosis and treatment of}} S. stercoralis is crucial to prevent complicated cases of strongyloidiasis. The value of the preference of <b>agar</b> <b>plate</b> culture, in detection of S. stercoralis compared to formalin ether concentration method, reported in different studies in the world is variable from 1. 6 to 6 times. Therefore, the current study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of <b>agar</b> <b>plate</b> on some isolates from north of Iran. Methods: Nine hundred stool samples were randomly collected from rural areas of Mazandaran Province, northern Iran. All samples were examined by <b>agar</b> <b>plate</b> culture, formalin ether concentration and direct smear. Results: <b>Agar</b> <b>plate</b> was 2 times superior to formalin ether; however, it showed some false negative results, too. The direct method could only detect cases of hyperinfection strongyloidosis. Conclusion: On the whole, combination of <b>agar</b> <b>plate</b> culture and formalin ether concentration is recommended to obtain higher efficacy...|$|R

The diagnostic {{efficacy of the}} <b>agar</b> <b>plate</b> culture was as high as 93. 9 % compared to only 28. 5 % and 26. 5 % by the Harada-Mori filter paper culture and faecal concentration methods, when faecal samples were examined simultaneously by these three methods. Among the 49 positive samples, about 60 % were confirmed to be positive only by the <b>agar</b> <b>plate</b> culture.

25|$|Bartonella spp. are fastidious, slow-growing {{bacteria}} {{that are difficult}} to grow using traditional solid agar plate culture methods due to complex nutritional requirements and potentially a low number of circulating bacteria. This conventional method of culturing Bartonella spp. from blood inoculates plated directly onto solid <b>agar</b> <b>plates</b> requires an extended incubation period of 21 days due to the slow growth rate.|$|E
25|$|Although {{this method}} can be time consuming, it gives an {{accurate}} {{estimate of the}} number of viable cells (because only {{they will be able to}} grow and form visible colonies). It is therefore extensively used in experiments aiming to quantify the number of cells resisting drugs or other external conditions (for instance the Luria–Delbrück experiment or the gentamicin protection assay). In addition, the enumeration of colonies on <b>agar</b> <b>plates</b> can be greatly facilitated by using colony counters.|$|E
25|$|Blood <b>agar</b> <b>plates</b> (BAPs) contain {{mammalian}} blood (usually sheep or horse), typically at {{a concentration}} of 5–10%. BAPs are enriched, differential media used to isolate fastidious organisms and detect hemolytic activity. β-Hemolytic activity will show lysis and complete digestion of red blood cell contents surrounding a colony. Examples include Streptococcus haemolyticus. α-Hemolysis will only cause partial lysis of the red blood cells (the cell membrane is left intact) and will appear green or brown, due to the conversion of hemoglobin to methemoglobin. An example {{of this would be}} Streptococcus viridans. γ-Hemolysis (or nonhemolytic) is the term referring to a lack of hemolytic activity. BAPs also contain meat extract, tryptone, sodium chloride, and agar.|$|E

25|$|<b>Agar</b> <b>plates</b> may be {{formulated}} {{as either}} permissive, {{with the intent}} of allowing the growth of whatever organisms are present, or restrictive or selective, {{with the intent of}} only allowing growth a particular subset of those organisms. This may {{take the form of a}} nutritional requirement, for instance providing a particular compound such as lactose as the only source of carbon and thereby selecting only organisms which can metabolize that compound, or by including a particular antibiotic or other substance to select only organisms which are resistant to that substance. This correlates to some degree with defined and undefined media; undefined media, made from natural products and containing an unknown combination of very many organic molecules, is typically more permissive in terms of supplying the needs of a wider variety of organisms, while defined media can be precisely tailored to select organisms with specific properties.|$|E
25|$|Although theoretically, any living cell {{might be}} used as the {{background}} to a two-hybrid analysis, there are practical considerations that dictate which is chosen. The chosen cell line should be relatively cheap and easy to culture and sufficiently robust to withstand application of the investigative methods and reagents. The latter is especially important for doing high-throughput studies. Therefore the yeast S. cerevisiae has been the main host organism for two-hybrid studies. However it is not always the ideal system to study interacting proteins from other organisms. Yeast cells often {{do not have the same}} post translational modifications, have a different codon use or lack certain proteins that are important for the correct expression of the proteins. To cope with these problems several novel two-hybrid systems have been developed. Depending on the system used <b>agar</b> <b>plates</b> or specific growth medium is used to grow the cells and allow selection for interaction. The most common used method is the agar plating one where cells are plated on selective medium to see of interaction takes place. Cells that have no interaction proteins should not survive on this selective medium.|$|E
