5|$|After winning Miss India World, Chopra {{was cast}} as the female lead in Abbas-Mustan's romantic thriller Humraaz (2002), {{in which she was}} to make her film debut. However, this fell through for various reasons: she stated the {{production}} conflicted with her schedule, while the producers said they re-cast because Chopra took on various other commitments. Her screen debut occurred in the 2002 Tamil film Thamizhan as the love interest of the protagonist, played by Vijay. A review published in The Hindu was <b>appreciative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film for its wit and dialogue, however it felt that Chopra's role was limited from an acting viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|Coolsma {{found that}} Sundanese {{literature}} consisted predominantly of poetry, including the narrative wawacan, {{and thought that}} prose needed to be developed as well so that the people would embrace modernity. He considered that they rarely read, instead preferring to listen to more educated persons sing in verse. As such, the contents of written prose would not be conveyed. This {{is not to say}} that he disliked Sundanese poetry; he was <b>appreciative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dangding verse forms– derived from Javanese literary tradition– which were used to write wawacan, and considered an existing translation of the Gospel of Matthew in dangding to be the best Sundanese-language book in print.|$|E
5|$|Four {{days after}} the shootout, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against Doc Holliday and the Earps. Wyatt and Holliday were arrested and brought before Justice of the Peace, Wells Spicer. Morgan and Virgil were still {{recovering}} at home. Only Wyatt and Holliday were required to post $10,000 bail, which was paid by their attorney Thomas Fitch, local mine owner E.B. Gage, Wells Fargo undercover agent Fred Dodge, and other business owners <b>appreciative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earps' efforts to maintain order. Virgil Earp was suspended as town marshal pending {{the outcome of the}} trial. Justice Spicer convened a preliminary hearing on October 31 to determine if there was enough evidence to go to trial.|$|E

5|$|After {{these changes}} were made, the test {{audience}} became more <b>appreciative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series, and GSN announced its development {{to the public}} at an upfront presentation in New York City on March 21, 2012 for the network's upcoming programming. By this time, a pilot episode had already been shot with American stand-up comedian and television personality Jeff Foxworthy performing the hosting duties for the show. When first asked if he was interested in hosting the show, Foxworthy was hesitant; he agreed to take on the role after learning that contestants would be playing for charity rather than on their own behalf. Casting for the series was held in various cities from May to June 2012. On July 7, 2012, GSN confirmed the show would premiere on August 23, 2012, alongside the premiere of Beat the Chefs.|$|E
5|$|Loev had {{its world}} premiere at the 2015 Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival. Upon its initial release, the film {{garnered}} generally positive reviews from film critics. It had its North American premiere at the 2016 South By Southwest Film Festival and premiered in India at the 2016 Mumbai International Film Festival, and was well {{received by the}} critics and audience alike. The script and the performances of Pandit and Ganesh were particularly praised. Commentators were also <b>appreciative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unconventional and fresh treatment of the taboo subject matter of same-sex relationships in India. The film won the Audience Award for Best Feature Film at the 2016 Tel Aviv International Film Festival. The worldwide distribution rights for Loev were acquired by Netflix and it was released on the platform on May 1, 2017.|$|E

The jury cited Gehry as [...] "Always open to experimentation, he has as well a sureness and {{maturity}} that resists, {{in the same way}} that Picasso did, being bound either by critical acceptance or his successes.

25|$|Almost {{immediately}} the 200B became Australia's top selling four-cylinder car, a position it held {{until it was}} displaced by the Mitsubishi Sigma. Its popularity however remained strong right through the production run, family buyers <b>appreciative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plentiful interior room and standard features. It may have been somewhat conservatively styled, but the effort Nissan had put into the engineering of the car made it reliable and tough, qualities most Australians rated higher than a more advanced design.|$|E
25|$|In 1863, Charles Cowden Clarke {{also wrote}} on this play. Kehler notes {{he was the}} husband of famous Shakespearean scholar Mary Cowden Clarke. Charles was more <b>appreciative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower-class {{mechanicals}} of the play. He commented favourably on their individualisation and their collective richness of character. He thought that Bottom was conceited but good natured, and shows a considerable store of imagination in his interaction with {{the representatives of the}} fairy world. He also argued that Bottom's conceit was a quality inseparable from his secondary profession, that of an actor.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel was}} made into the film Lady in the Lake, {{starring}} and directed by Robert Montgomery. Montgomery tried a technique that had often been talked about in Hollywood but never used in a major film: he used the camera as the protagonist (Philip Marlowe) of the film. Other characters talk directly to the camera. The voice of Marlowe is that of Montgomery, but his face is shown only in reflections. Reviews of the film were not <b>appreciative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new approach. Most critics gave the director credit for trying an experimental technique but felt the experiment had been a failure.|$|E
40|$|Yes, {{there really}} are such things and people do {{actually}} keep them.

25|$|He put out in 1935 a {{sympathetic}} {{book on the}} ill-fated expedition of Semion Chelyuskin, followed in 1937 by Les onzes républiques soviétiques ("The Eleven Soviet Republics"), at Éditions Payot. The latter book was well-liked in the Soviet Union itself, and recommended by Intourist, but criticized by Pierre Pascal for its geographical and historical inaccuracies. In 1938, Slonim also translated Viktor Shklovsky's Voyage de Marco Polo. However, he had grown more <b>appreciative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sovremennye Zapiski writers, and in 1939, published generous commentary on Vladimir Nabokov's work, beginning with King, Queen, Knave. That year, Slonim also completed a version of Bunin's Liberation of Tolstoy, published by Gallimard but disliked by the author.|$|E
25|$|Reports {{from the}} armored {{divisions}} that received them {{prior to the}} end of hostilities were generally positive. Crews liked the improved off-road performance and reliability, but were most <b>appreciative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 75mm main gun, which was a vast improvement over the 37mm. The M24 was not up to the challenge of fighting German tanks, but the bigger gun at least gave its crews a much better chance to fight back when it was required. The M24's light armor made it vulnerable to virtually all German tanks, anti-tank guns, and hand-held anti-tank weapons. The contribution of the M24 to winning the war in Europe was insignificant, as too few arrived too late to replace the worn-out M5s of the armored divisions.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{retirement}} from competitive golf in 1930, {{and even in}} the years leading up to that, Jones had {{become one of the most}} famous sports figures in the world, and was recognized virtually everywhere he went in public. While certainly <b>appreciative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enormous adulation and media coverage, this massive attention caused Jones to lose personal privacy in golf circles, and he wished to create a private golf club where he and his friends could play golf in peace and quiet. For several years, he searched for a property near Atlanta where he could develop his own golf club. His friend Clifford Roberts, a New York City investment dealer, knew of Jones's desire, became aware of a promising property for sale in Augusta, Georgia, where Jones's mother-in-law had grown up, and informed Jones about it. Jones first visited Fruitlands, an Augusta arboretum and indigo plantation since the Civil War era, in the spring of 1930, and he purchased it for $70,000 in 1931, with the plan to design a golf course on the site.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{increased}} {{applications and}} scholarship, appreciative inquiry remains a research method with little self-reflection or critique {{to evaluate the}} process as an action research method. Perhaps counter-intuitively, we propose that critical theory provides one useful lens through which to develop an <b>appreciative</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process. We begin this article with a brief introduction to appreciative inquiry (Ai) as it {{is presented in the}} literature. Calls for evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process are acknowledged, as are <b>the</b> few evaluations/critiques <b>of</b> Ai we have found in literature. We discuss how critical theory may be applied to an evaluation <b>of</b> <b>appreciative</b> inquiry bridging an apparent paradox between the negativity associated with the former and <b>the</b> positive focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter. An initial application <b>of</b> Critical <b>Appreciative</b> Process (CAP) is described to illustrate how <b>the</b> integrated use <b>of</b> <b>appreciative</b> inquiry and critical theory deepens insight and recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complexity in human endeavours...|$|R

40|$|According to the {{proposition}} {{brought about by}} Yanagi at its early stage, Mingei (Folk Crafts) are, originally, objects of household, by unknown craftsmen and for everyday use of ordinary people. Thanks to these properties, handicrafts become <b>appreciative</b> <b>of</b> beauty. In <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> Mingei, <b>the</b> act <b>of</b> creation alone {{is not sufficient to}} give things beauty. All crafts have to have 'after-life' and beauty to a large extent arises from the way in which things are used in this after-life. That is why, the more objects are used, the more beautiful they become. As a matter of fact, however, a number of Mingei used to turn out different things...|$|R
25|$|In 1965, Martin {{launched}} his weekly NBC comedy-variety series, The Dean Martin Show, which ran for 264 episodes until 1974. He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy in 1966 and was nominated again {{the following three}} years. The show exploited his image as a carefree boozer. Martin capitalized on his laid-back persona of the half-drunk crooner, hitting on women with remarks that would get anyone else slapped, and making snappy if slurred remarks about fellow celebrities during his roasts. During an interview on the British TV documentary Wine, Women and Song, aired in 1983, he stated, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that he had someone record them on cassette tape so he could listen to them. His TV show was a success. The show's loose format featured quick-witted improvisation from Martin and his weekly guests. This prompted a battle between Martin and NBC censors, who insisted on more scrutiny of the content. The show was often in the Top Ten. Martin, <b>appreciative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show's producer, his friend Greg Garrison, made a handshake deal giving Garrison, a pioneer TV producer in the 1950s, 50% of the show. However, the validity of that ownership {{is the subject of}} a lawsuit brought by NBCUniversal.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the close}} of a September day in the year 1864, a crowd of {{students}} was collected on the Bowdoin campus near the Thorndike oak. Each class was not only represented, but present almost in its entirety; still, as the college at that time bore upon its rolls only about a hundred names, the reader is not to imagine the assembly as one of remarkable proportions. The several classes, without being grouped as separate bodies, were in a measure distinct, as if their members were drawn together by community of sentiment or interest. The center, of the throng was composed mainly of Sophomores who, to the melody of tin horns, devil's fiddles and watchmen's rattles, {{from time to time}} added vocal effects scarcely less loud and discordant. Next to them stood the open-eyed Freshmen, eagerly <b>appreciative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novelty of the scene; while most of the upper-class men were ranged along the outer edge or a little apart, and were endeavoring to preserve looks and attitudes of aloofness and indifference. The object of attraction appeared to be a tall, spare man who was standing upon a rude plank-and-barrel rostrum, and, whenever the uproar would permit, launching his remarks in a violent manner at the bystanders. He was apparently some sixty years of age. His head was uncovered, showing his hair thin and streaked with gray. His face was smooth except for a stubbly two days' growth of beard, and was wrinkled and browned by exposure to the weather. Beside him upon the platform rested a dilapidated silk hat which, as well as his suit of rusty black, looked as if it might have been discarded some years before by its former owner. They were not, however, incongruous {{with the rest of his}} attire, since both his dickey above and his shirt below his black stock bore the same signs of poverty and neglect.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Since its {{publication}} in 1985 Paul David’s “Economics of QWERTY ” {{has provided a}} paradigm case for the understanding and application of path-dependent processes in economics, {{some of which have}} been identified as yielding sub-optimal outcomes. The accuracy and relevance of this case, and this entire theoretical approach, has been subjected to critical scrutiny by Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margolis {{in a series of articles}} and in a recent book. In this article I provide a wide ranging, and largely <b>appreciative,</b> review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book and highlight, in some detail, the fundamental disagreements with which it deals.

500|$|Peter and Lois {{are leaving}} a doctor's office when actor Ryan Reynolds asks them for directions. He seems very <b>appreciative</b> <b>of</b> Peter. <b>The</b> next morning Peter notices that Ryan has moved in across the street, taking Cleveland Brown's former residence. Ryan says he's filming {{for a movie}} nearby. Peter attends Ryan's housewarming party that night, at which Ryan tickles him and {{requests}} that he return the favor. [...] Later that week, they go out to dinner, but Peter immediately exits the restaurant when Ryan tries to kiss him. The next day, Peter tells Lois he believes Ryan is gay but Lois rejects the idea. Peter confronts Ryan, who replies that he is only attracted to Peter's spirit {{in the way that}} a man is attracted to a woman. Angered by Peter's accusation, Ryan orders him to leave and that they can never talk again—but hands him a cell phone so they can [...] "always talk".|$|R
