5|$|The legal Underbelly DVD was {{released}} 8 May 2008 by Roadshow Entertainment, {{a day after}} the final episode was aired on television. In accordance with the legal suppression, the release was not distributed through any retail or rental outlets in Victoria or on the internet. Roadshow Entertainment has confirmed that all box sets and point of sale displays will carry a sticker or stamp reminding buyers the series is not for sale, distribution or exhibition in Victoria. Legal experts said Victorians who bought the box set interstate <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>it</b> themselves at home would likely not fall foul of the law, but anyone who showed it more widely could be charged with contempt. The DVD has sold 265,000 copies around Australia. In September 2008, a Limited Edition DVD {{was released}}, containing a numbered steel case and an extra disc with a documentary entitled Carl Williams– A Day of Reckoning. The Underbelly soundtrack was released on 29 March 2008, both as a CD and online. It features elements of the score by Burkhard Dallwitz in addition to music tracks that were featured in the series. Underbelly was released on Blu-ray on 5 August 2010.|$|E

25|$|A new clubhouse {{was built}} on Belle Isle in 1891, but was burned in 1893. Another {{boathouse}} lasted until 1901 when it also burned. In an attempt to save the structure, club member and fire commissioner Fred Moran ordered all available firefighting apparatus to the scene. Horses thundered over the old wooden bridge, dragging heavy engines and trucks behind them. The fire tug James Battle became grounded in the shallow water and remained stuck fast until the following noon. Fire equipment failed to {{get close enough to}} the burning building due to mud and the distance of the old clubhouse from the shore. Helpless, they stood <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>it</b> burn. The next morning, club members vowed once again to rebuild their clubhouse.|$|E

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{wrote that}} the ending from this episode [...] "did have a season finale feel to it with the big musical number. [...] Still, {{it was a great}} season, and I loved going out with two of the best characters on TV summing up the moment perfectly – Liz: 'We sure had quite a year.' Jack: 'What are you talking about? It's May.'" [...] Canning gave it an 8.5 out of 10 rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{wrote that the}} [...] "all-star cast of musicians" [...] featured were not able to dominate the episode [...] "to the point where the episode didn't work." [...] Sepinwall, however, added that despite [...] "Kidney Now!" [...] not being a classic 30 Rock episode [...] "it was [...] funny enough – which, I suppose, also makes it an appropriate finale for this uneven season." [...] Further in the review, Sepinwall was complimentary towards Liz's plot, writing that the character's sequence on The Vontella Show was [...] "hilarious, and a fine demonstration of how much confidence Tina Fey has gained as an actress over the years." [...] The A.V. Club’s Nathan Rabin also enjoyed the Liz character, reporting that she [...] "delivered a virtuoso performance in , instantly homing in on the fatal flaw in every relationship and obliterating it with highly quotable sass." [...] In discussion to Tracy's plot, Rabin opined it was the [...] "weakest of the various threads" [...] in this episode. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad confessed in his recap {{that he was going to}} summarize [...] "Kidney Now!" [...] as [...] "a little disappointing, but then I hit rewind on my DVR <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>it</b> again and realized, wow, they actually hit all of the season finale notes rather perfectly [...] This episode was quite funny." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by David Mould was filmed entirely in black-and-white in Plaça de Sant Felip Neri, Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic), Barcelona on October 10, 2003. Lee described {{the place of}} the filming during an interview with MTV News: [...] "We did it in a cool, old area of town. We shot some of it at this scenic point, and there was a rooftop where you could see Barcelona below. It was really neat." [...] The version of the song used on the video is different from the one off the record, with the band entering the song {{at the end of the}} bridge and a string arrangement by David Campbell. [...] Evanescence wanted the band version to be on the album as well, but [...] "the label was stuck on the demo and wouldn't let us use the version we really wanted. We fought back and forth about it and finally we gave in, but we were all so angry about it." [...] The video was filmed two weeks before Ben Moody's departure from the band. Amy Lee admitted that the visuals in the video were [...] "striking in retrospect", but added that the similarities between what was filmed and Moody's departure were coincidental: [...] "We shot it in Barcelona about a week before Ben left the band unexpectedly. I think none of us knew, including him, that he was going anywhere. And when we got the video back <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>it,</b> it was right after he had left. And it's bizarre how much the video is about that. We all sat there with goose bumps, like, 'Holy crap. We've got to watch that again.'"

500|$|The episode {{featured}} Mel Gibson {{as a guest}} voice. Scully {{had previously}} met him while writing jokes for a school fundraiser {{along with his wife}} Julie Thacker. Gibson and Daniel Stern were the hosts and needed jokes for the event. It turned out that Gibson was a fan of the show <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>it</b> with his children. With that knowledge, it did not take Scully long to invite him to do a part. Gibson was willing to do the job and even came in on three separate occasions to do retakes – mostly because he knew his children would be watching. Unlike most guest voices, Gibson recorded the show along with the cast. On one occasion, it turned out that a joke written for Gibson actually did happen in real life. The writing staff wanted Gibson to say that he would urinate behind a dumpster, because it sounded like {{it would not be a}} classy thing to do for a movie star. He had, however, already done that during a couple of film premieres because he can feel trapped in a public toilet with a lot of fans. Gibson was surprised the writers knew about the story, but it turned out to be a coincidence. Otherwise, the episode frequently references films Gibson appeared in. After the studio cart crashes, Gibson says to Homer, [...] "I'm getting too old for this crap," [...] a reference to a line said by Danny Glover's character Roger Murtaugh to Gibson's character Martin Riggs in the Lethal Weapon film series. A poster for his film Braveheart is on the wall in the editing room and the Road Warrior car from the 1981 film Mad Max 2 is also featured. In addition to Gibson, Jack Burns guest starred in the episode, voicing a film studio executive named Edward Christian. His frequent use of the terms [...] "Huh?" [...] and [...] "You know what I mean?" [...] is a reference to a comedy routine performed by Burns and Avery Schreiber. The episode also features John Travolta, in whose private jet Gibson flies to Springfield, but his voice was imitated by Dan Castellaneta.|$|E

2500|$|In Faraday's first {{experimental}} demonstration (August 29, 1831), {{he wrapped}} two wires around {{opposite sides of}} an iron ring or [...] "torus" [...] (an arrangement similar to a modern toroidal transformer). Based on his understanding of electromagnets, he expected that, when current started to flow in one wire, a sort of wave would travel through the ring and cause some electrical effect on the opposite side. He plugged one wire into a galvanometer, <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>it</b> as he connected the other wire to a battery. He saw a transient current, which he called a [...] "wave of electricity", when he connected the wire to the battery and another when he disconnected it. This induction {{was due to the}} change in magnetic flux that occurred when the battery was connected and disconnected. Within two months, Faraday found several other manifestations of electromagnetic induction. For example, he saw transient currents when he quickly slid a bar magnet {{in and out of a}} coil of wires, and he generated a steady (DC) current by rotating a copper disk near the bar magnet with a sliding electrical lead ("Faraday's disk").|$|E
