Asymmetric pulses are charge-balanced stimuli where the contribution of one phase (one polarity) is reduced by making it longer and lower in amplitude than the other. For the design of novel CI speech processing strategies using asymmetric pulses, it is particularly relevant to know which of the two polarities (negative/cathodic or positive/anodic) is most effective. Research on animal models and computational models have shown that the cathodic phase is the most “effective” one in terms of producing most of the excitation in the auditory nerve. However, recently, psychophysical and physiological data obtained from CI users in our lab suggested just the opposite, i. e. that the <b>anodic</b> <b>phase</b> is more effective than the cathodic one. The aim of the present study is to examine how AN fibers are affected by different stimuli in human CI users and more specifically, to determine which phase is the most effective one.

40|$|International audienceMost {{cochlear}} implants (CIs) {{stimulate the}} auditory nerve with trains of symmetric biphasic pulses {{consisting of two}} phases of opposite polarity. Animal and human {{studies have shown that}} both polarities can elicit neural responses. In human CI listeners, studies have shown that at suprathreshold levels, the <b>anodic</b> <b>phase</b> is more effective than the cathodic phase. In contrast, animal studies usually show the opposite trend. Although the reason for this discrepancy remains unclear, computational modelling results have proposed that the degeneration of the peripheral processes of the neurons could lead to a higher efficiency of anodic stimulation. We tested this hypothesis in ten guinea pigs who were deafened with an injection of sysomycin and implanted with a single ball electrode inserted in the first turn of the cochlea. Animals were tested at regular intervals between 1 week after deafening and up to 1 year for some of them. Our hypothesis was that if the effect of polarity is determined by {{the presence or absence of}} peripheral processes, the difference in polarity efficiency should change over time because of a progressive neural degeneration. Stimuli consisted of charge-balanced symmetric and asymmetric pulses allowing us to observe the response to each polarity individually. For all stimuli, the inferior colliculus evoked potential was measured. Results show that the cathodic phase was more effective than the <b>anodic</b> <b>phase</b> and that this remained so even several months after deafening. This suggests that neural degeneration cannot entirely account for the higher efficiency of anodic stimulation observed in human CI listeners...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Depending on {{waveform}} parameters such as amplitude, frequency or phase, transcranial {{alternating current}} stimulation (tACS) can {{increase or decrease}} cortical excitability. Cortical networks are composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and tACS has a spatially broad effect across this network. We hypothesised that low frequency tACS simultaneously activates both excitatory and inhibitory neurons within a network and that network output, measured as an increase or decrease in cortical excitability, depends on the intra-network balance between excitation and inhibition. Methods In anesthetized rats (n= 5) a disk electrode {{was placed on the}} skull over the hind-limb motor cortex area to deliver standard subthreshold tACS (2 - 6 Hz sine waves, 0. 05 - 0. 6 mA) and short bursts of suprathreshold pulse-trains (see figure). Two modes of suprathreshold stimulation were developed using short bursts (10 pulses, 11 - 33 ms) of either low or high-frequency pulse trains (300 - 900 pps) at high current amplitudes (2 - 4 mA). Continuous tACS was presented with short suprathreshold pulse-trains inserted at different phases to assess cortical excitability via limb movement quantified with an accelerometer and EMG. An MRI based computational model was used to calculate the cortical electric field produced by the stimulation. Results High and low-frequency suprathreshold stimulation produced distinctly different patterns of hind-limb EMG activity, indicating different modes of excitation. When cortical excitability was assessed using low-frequency pulse trains, tACS cathodic phases decreased cortical excitability and <b>anodic</b> <b>phases</b> increased excitability (see figure). However, when a high-frequency pulse train was used, the effect was reversed - tACS cathodic phases increased cortical excitability and <b>anodic</b> <b>phases</b> decreased excitability. The computational model showed that tACS produced electric fields between 1 - 12 V/m, while the suprathreshold stimulation was 40 - 80 V/m. Discussion Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that tACS acts on a network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Whether a tACS phase increases or decreases excitability depends on the intra-network balance between inhibition and excitation. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{behavioral}} {{studies have}} suggested that the human auditory nerve of cochlear implant (CI) users is mainly excited by the positive (anodic) polarity. Those findings were only obtained using asymmetric pseudomonophasic (PS) pulses where the effect of one phase was measured {{in the presence of a}} counteracting phase of opposite polarity, longer duration, and lower amplitude than the former phase. It was assumed that only the short high-amplitude phase was responsible for the excitation. Similarly, it has been shown that electrically evoked compound action potentials could only be obtained in response to the <b>anodic</b> <b>phases</b> of asymmetric pulses. Here, experiment 1 measured electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses to standard symmetric, PS, reversed pseudomonophasic, and reversed pseudomonophasic with inter-phase gap (6 ms) pulses presented for both polarities. Responses were time locked to the short high-amplitude phase of asymmetric pulses and were smaller, but still measurable, when that phase was cathodic than when it was anodic. This provides the first evidence that cathodic stimulation can excite the auditory system of human CI listeners and confirms that this stimulation is nevertheless less effective than for the anodic polarity. A second experiment studied the polarity sensitivity at different intensities by means of a loudness balancing task between pseudomonophasic anodic (PSA) and pseudomonophasic cathodic (PSC) stimuli. Previous studies had demonstrated greater sensitivity to anodic stimulation only for stimuli producing loud percepts.

40|$|International audienceThe {{number of}} devices for {{electrical}} stimulation of nerve fibres implanted worldwide for medical applications is constantly increasing. Stimulation charge {{is one of}} the most important parameters of stimulation. High stimulation charge may cause tissue and electrode damage and also compromise the battery life of the electrical stimulators. Therefore, the objective of minimizing stimulation charge is an important issue. Delaying the second phase of biphasic stimulation waveform may decrease the charge required for fibre activation, but its impact on stimulation selectivity is not known. This information is particularly relevant when transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode (TIME) is used, since it has been designed to provide for high selectivity. In this in vivo study, the rat sciatic nerve was electrically stimulated using monopolar and bipolar configurations with TIME.

Thresholds for alternating monophasic stimuli, in which <b>anodic</b> and cathodic <b>phases</b> alternated every 5 ms, were 5 - 8 dB lower than for the biphasic waveforms for all four subjects.

These pseudomonophasic thresholds were greatly affected neither by a 500 -micros gap inserted between the two phases, nor by whether the shorter phase preceded or followed the longer one. Loudness balancing measures performed at the most comfortable levels also showed that, for equal loudness, alternating monophasic stimuli required a lower level than biphasic and pseudomonophasic waveforms.

The multi-electrode system contained ninety-nine platinum electrodes {{embedded within a}} self-curling spiral silicone sheet. The electrodes were organized in a matrix having nine parallel groups, each containing eleven electrodes. Preliminary testing of the nerve cuff was performed in an isolated segment of a swinish left cervical vagus nerve. For selective vagus nerve stimulation, precisely defined current quasitrapezoidal, asymmetric and biphasic stimulating pulses were applied to preselected locations along the left vagus segment via appointed group of three electrodes within the cuff. Selective stimulation was obtained by anodal block. However, these pulses may not be safe for a long-term application because of a frequently used high imbalance between the cathodic and anodic part of the stimulating pulse. Preliminary {{results show that the}} cuff was capable of exciting A and B-fibres, and, that for a certain range of parameters used in stimulating pulses, the contribution of A-fibres to the CAP was slightly reduced and the contribution of B-fibres was slightly larger.

40|$|Worldwide, Cochlear Implants (CIs) {{have already}} {{partially}} restored hearing to over 219000 profoundly hearing-impaired people. CIs attempt {{to stimulate the}} survival Auditory Nerve (AN) fibers directly by means of electrical pulses. Electrical stimulation is provided via an array of electrodes implanted inside the cochlea, which directly activates the AN fibers by means of biphasic Symmetric (SYM) pulses, i. e. an initial phase followed by a second phase with the same amplitude but with opposite polarity. Because electrical stimulation is delivered extracellularly, AN fibers could become depolarized and hyperpolarized at several neural sites and the excitation may be substantially different depending on AN status, electrode-neuron interface, and polarity. The necessity of charge balanced stimulation has precluded the use of monophasic stimuli (pulses consisting only in one phase) to study polarity effects in human CI users {{and most of the}} research concerning polarity effectiveness has been investigated in animal and computational models. However, recently, asymmetric charge-balanced pulse shapes and CI devices with recording capabilities have allowed researchers to study polarity effectiveness on CI users either by means of Electrically evoked Compound Action Potential (ECAP) or by means of behavioral measurements. Contrary to the majority of the results obtained with animals and computational models, those studies suggest that the positive (anodic) current stimulates the AN more effectively than the cathodic one in human CI users. The studies presented in this document aim to examine how neurons at different sites are affected by different stimulus shapes as well as the potential benefits of combining non-standard pulse shapes by means of objective ECAP and Electrically evoked Auditory Brainstem Response (EABR) as well as behavioral experiments. In chapter 2 we study whether the high sensitivity to the anodic current observed formerly for an electrode {{in the middle of the}} array, can be generalized to stimulation at the base and apex of the CI array. Threeexperiments studied the effect of stimulus polarity on the ECAP obtained with the masker-probe paradigm on different sites along the cochlea in CI users. The results of all the experiments extend those of a previous study, showing that the AN in humans is preferentially activated by anodic stimulation, to different sites along the cochlea by means of Monopolar (MP) stimulation. In chapter 3 we present a quantitative analysis of ECAP responses in order to determine an objective detection criterion based on the statistical properties of the noise. The study quantitatively investigates the properties of the Background Noise (BN) and the remaining post average Residual Noise (RN) in ECAP responses recorded from human CI users with the Across-sweeps Noise Estimator (ASNE) method. The analysis of the statistical properties of the noise indicated that a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 1. 7 dB as a detection criterion corresponds to a false positive detection rate of 1 % with the used measurement setup. In chapter 4 we study whether the high sensitivity to the anodic current is also observed in Bipolar (BP) stimulation mode. Spreads of Excitation (SOEs) produced by different masking pulse shapes presented in MP and BP mode are examined by means of the ECAP, obtained using the forward-masked paradigm in human CI users. The SOEs obtained with the MP masker showed a main excitation peak close to the masker electrode, whereas SYM maskers produced bimodal excitation patterns showing two peaks close to the electrodes of the masker channel. The SOEs obtained using Symmetric with a long Inter-Phase Gap (SYM-IPG) (for which the maskers second phase is responsible for most of the masking) and Pseudomonophasic (PS) maskers were more pronounced close to the masker electrode for which the effective <b>phase</b> was <b>anodic.</b> These results showed that the anodic polarity is the most effective one in BP mode and that the bimodal patterns produced by SYM maskers could be partially reduced by using asymmetric pulses. Chapter 5 investigates polarity effects at the level of the brainstem. Previous behavioral studies showing that the human AN of CI users is mainly excited by the anodic polarity have only been obtained with asymmetric PS, and it was assumed that only the short high-amplitude phase was responsible for the excitation. Similarly, in our previous studies it has been shown that ECAPs could only be obtained in response to the <b>anodic</b> <b>phases</b> of asymmetric pulses. However, it is possible that ECAP responses to cathodic responses were not detected due to the characteristics of the effective place of excitation across and along the AN fibers. In this chapter we measured EABRs to SYM and asymmetric pulse shapes presented for both polarities. It is shown that responses were time-locked to the short high-amplitude phase of asymmetric pulses, and were smaller, but still measurable, when that phase was cathodicthan when it was anodic. A behavioral experiment studied the polarity sensitivity at different intensities by means of a loudness balancing task between asymmetric stimuli of opposite polarity. The results showed that cathodic stimuli required higher amplitudes than anodic stimuli to reach the same loudness at different stimulus levels. This study provides the first evidence that cathodic stimulation can excite the auditory system of human CI listeners, and confirms that this stimulation is nevertheless less effective than for the anodic polarity. nrpages: 245 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The low {{density and}} high {{relative}} strength of Mg alloys means they can offer engineering benefits over steels or Al alloys. However, the susceptibility of Mg alloys to corrosion has limited their exploitation and restricted their use to more benign environments. An Mg-Al intermetallic surface layer {{is a good}} candidate for a robust corrosion protection method. This work demonstrates their development by using a novel ionic liquid electroplating process to deposit Al on to Mg substrates that when heat treated diffuses to form discrete intermetallic layers. Examination of three Mg-Al-Zn alloys showed that the amount Mg-Al intermetallic phases in their microstructures was linked to the quantity of Al they contained. Subsequent self-corrosion measurements using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated that their performance was connected to the amount of intermetallic present, and in particular the strength of the micro-galvanic couples generated between the <b>anodic</b> and cathodic <b>phases.</b> Measurements of the self-corrosion behaviour of manufactured samples of the Mg-Al intermetallics confirmed that they could provide significant improvements, but it was acknowledged that their noble nature compared to an Mg substrate would encourage galvanic corrosion if a surface layer was damaged. As such the galvanic activity of the Mg-Al-Zn alloys and Mg-Al intermetallics was compared against a pure Mg standard using zero resistance ammetry and the resistance box technique. Galvanic models of alloy self-corrosion and a damaged intermetallic surface layer were also used to assess the potential problem. These measurements demonstrated that the intermetallics could act as strong cathodes, but further discussion {{on the nature of the}} behaviour suggested means by which galvanic corrosion might self-limit or self-repair. The galvanic corrosion experiments also revealed how the combination of current flow and a solution saturated with Mg 2 + ions could lead to the formation of a highly protective Mg(OH) 2 film with promising characteristics...|$|R

Switched dc and sinusoidal currents are applied with amplitudes of several amps and operating frequencies being varied between 10 Hz and 10 kHz. The temperature is deduced from the grey body radiation of the electrode being recorded with a spectroscopic measuring system. Phase resolved {{values of the}} electrode tip temperature T tip and of the power input P in are determined comparing the measured temperature distributions with the integral of the one dimensional heat balance with these parameters as integration constants. They are supplemented by phase resolved measurements of the sum of cathode and anode fall called electrode sheath voltage. If a switched dc current is applied {{it is found that}} both quantities are within the cathodic phase only marginally higher than for a cathode being operated with a dc current. T tip and P in start to decrease for low currents and to increase for high currents {{at the beginning of the}} <b>anodic</b> <b>phase.</b> But with increasing operating frequency the deviations from the cathodic phase are reduced until they cannot be resolved for frequencies of several kHz. A more pronounced modulation but the same tendencies are observed with a sinusoidal current waveform. For 10 kHz a diffuse arc attachment with an almost phase independent electrode tip temperature, which deviates only marginally from that of a dc cathode, and an electrode sheath voltage proportional to the arc current is established with both current waveforms...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{dependence}} of the gas phase emitter effect of Dy on {{a variation of the}} operating frequency between some Hz and 2 kHz is investigated in a HID lamp. The buffer gas of the lamp consisting of Ar, Kr and predominantly Hg is seeded with DyI 3, its burner vessel is formed from transparent YAG material. Phase and spatial resolved emission spectroscopy in front of the lamp electrode and pyrometric temperature measurements along the tungsten electrode are performed with a spectroscopic set up. Dy atom and ion densities in front of the electrode are deduced from absolute intensities of optically thin Dy lines and a plasma temperature, derived from the absolute intensity of mercury lines. Phase resolved values of the electrode tip temperature T tip and input power P in are obtained from temperature distributions along the electrode. Distinctly higher Dy ion and atom densities are measured in front of the electrode within the cathodic phase. With increasing operating frequency a reduction of both, atoms and ions, is observed in front of the cathode. In contrast, an increase of the ion density in front of the anode is seen. Moreover, the Dy ion density is drastically reduced by an additional seeding of the lamp with T lI. It is found that an up rating of the Dy ion density is correlated with a decline of T tip and P in. At higher frequencies this effect takes place not only within the cathodic phase but also within the <b>anodic</b> <b>phase.</b> The reduction of the average electrode tip temperature on the order of several hundred Kelvin compared to a YAG lamp with a pure mercury filling is explained by a Dy monolayer on the electrode surface which is sustained by a Dy ion current...|$|E
40|$|Bipolar (BP) {{stimulation}} {{has been}} suggested as a method to reduce the spread of current along the cochlea. However, behavioral measurements in BP mode have shown either similar or worse performance than in Monopolar (MP) mode. This {{could be explained by}} a bimodal excitation, with two main excitation peaks at the sites of the stimulating electrodes. Here, we compared excitation patterns produced by different pulse shapes presented in BP mode from 5 human Cochlear Implant (CI) users. Spread of Excitations (SOEs) were estimated by means of Electrically Evoked Compound Action Potential (ECAP) responses obtained with the forward-masking paradigm. Four types of askers were used: Symmetric (SYM), Pseudomonophasic (PS), Reversed Pseudomonophasic (RPS) and Symmetric with Inter-Phase Gap (SYM-IPG) pulses. Maskers were presented in BP + 9 (wide), BP + 3 (narrow) and MP (only SYM) mode on fixed electrodes. The SOEs obtained with MP maskers showed a main excitation peak closer to the masker electrode. Wide SYM maskers produced bimodal excitation patterns showing two peaks close to the electrodes of the masker channel, whereas SYM-IPG maskers showed a single main peak near the electrode for which the masker’s second phase (responsible for the masking) was anodic. Narrow SYM maskers showed complex and wider excitation patterns consistent with the overlap of the patterns produced by each channel’s electrodes. Narrow SYM-IPG, PS and RPS maskers patterns were high close to the masker electrode that delivered the effective <b>anodic</b> <b>phase.</b> These results showed that the anodic polarity is the most effective one in BP mode and that the bimodal pattens produced by SYM maskers can be reduced by using asymmetric pulses. Finally, analyses of ECAP’s latencies, amplitudes and widths suggest central excitation of the auditory nerve with both MP and BP stimulation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} years many {{scientific}} advances have been done {{on the development of}} neural prostheses [1] for hand amputees. Recent achievements in this field have made this challenge easier with the introduction of innovative biocompatible materials and the production of smart, light, artificial limbs characterized by lots of freedom degrees [2]. Despite such improvements, the communication between an implanted electrode and a prosthetic limb is still an open issue, due to long cables and cumbersome electronic equipments that typically separate them. In this contest it is very important the miniaturization of the electronic used to acquire the neural signals from efferent fibers of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) and to elicitate the afferent axons in order to restore the sensory feedback. Due to the weak amplitude of neural signals, this kind of design is particularly critical. Indeed neural signals are drowned in a noisy environment characterized by other biological electrical sources such as Electromyographic (EMG) interferences which have amplitudes many orders of magnitude greater than that of the neural signal and a bandwidth very close to them. The system proposed in this paper is based on a sigma delta converter divided into two main blocks: an on-chip analog front-end, that includes a sigma delta modulator and a digital part, realized off- chip on a FPGA. The main aim is to move the majority of the complexity on the digital side, keeping the analog part as simple as possible. The CMOS recording chip, designed on an AMS 0. 35 um process, contains 8 parallel readout channels and has a 4. 1 mm x 4. 1 mm die size. Several parameters (amplifier gain, opamp bandwidths, etc.) are programmable. Fig. 1 shows the chip test results for an input trace obtained from real measurements of an electrode implanted in a rat sciatic nerve. The original signal is largely affected by low-frequency noise (ECG and EMG) which is completely removed by the system. Regarding the stimulation unit another CMOS analog chip has been designed. It is able to deliver biphasic current pulses whose shape and parameters are summarized in Fig. 2 (on the left). The system is based on a single supply with anodic and cathodic active phases. Fig. 2 (on the right) shows the stimulation diagram. The stimulation is enabled by closing switch S 1 whereas with switch S 2 it is possible to select between <b>anodic</b> or cathodic <b>phase.</b> Even though the positive and negative currents have the same value, a residual charge can be accumulated at the electrode-nerve interface due to mismatches in the two current paths. As a result, some electrochemical damaging processes can occur at this interface. Therefore, to avoid charge accumulation, a periodic charge cancellation phase is necessary. A switch S 3 has been introduced to periodically shortcut the two electrode terminals removing all the stored charge. Due to the high value and to the high variability of the electrode-tissue impedance, a programmable high voltage stimulator is required. The designed stimulation system (Fig. 3) is based on a low voltage 6 -bit current DAC used to setup the stimulation current level. The current is then converted from a low into a high voltage signal by the output stage and injected into the nerve. The high voltage supply for the output stage is generated by a programmable voltage booster that increases the voltage up to 20 V. The stimulation unit and in particular the voltage booster has been designed achieving a good compromise between size and boosting time. The IC has been designed on an AMS High Voltage 0. 35 um CMOS process which includes both low voltage and high voltage transistors. Fig. 4 shows the stimulating chip layout...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three chapters. Each chapter addresses a specific topic and has been, or will be, submitted as a journal article. The overarching theme connecting {{the content of the}} three chapters is the problem of accurately determining the rate off corrosion in alloy-electrolyte systems. At the beginning of every chapter there is a separate abstract that has been prepared for the respective journal publication. Broadly, in order to computationally simulate the process of corrosion we need the following: a knowledge of the physical laws that govern the rate of corrosion, a framework to compute the rate for alloy-electrolyte systems using these laws, and a method to update the position and the electrochemical properties of a corrosive front using the computed reaction rate. In the electrolytic domain, the effect of ionic concentration on the reaction rate is computed using ionic transport models. The most commonly used ionic transport model combines a set of Nernst-Planck equations with the electroneutrality condition without including the Gauss' law. On the other hand, the methods using Gauss' law have been reported to be challenging for a numerical solution. We developed an alternative ionic transport model based on Onsager's theory of nearequilibrium dissipative processes. We assumed the flow caused due to ionic interactions, as obtained using Onsager's theory, to be an additional unknown for the ionic transport model. We proposed that the flux density created due to this additional flow is the minimum that is required to satisfy the electroneutrality condition. Using our method we were able to reproduce the transient characteristics of electrodes that agreed in behavior with experimental observations. Also based on our numerical simulations, we observed that the dissipation due to ionic interactions is higher near the ionic sources at the boundaries and diminishes gradually into the bulk of the electrolyte. The motion of an alloy-electrolyte interface due to corrosion is a multiscale problem in time. The ionic transport process evolves at a time step depending on the diffusivity of the ions and dimensions of the anodic-cathodic regions on an alloy surface. It turns out that this time step is several order of magnitudes smaller than the time step at which we can observe a significant change in the alloy-electrolyte boundary due to corrosion. We proposed a quasi-steady state assumption in order to alleviate this problem. We assumed that for a fixed description of the alloy-electrolyte boundary there exists a steady state solution to the corrosion current density as dictated by the ionic transport process. This is a reasonable assumption for several corrosive systems, particularly for the ones surrounded by seawater. A finite element framework with adaptive remeshing was developed that uses the ionic transport model described above to determine the corrosion rate and explicitly integrate the motion of the corrosive front. We studied and observed the convergence of this method with respect to refinement in time steps. This framework was built to modify the electrodic properties along an alloy-electrolyte interface depending upon the material composition of the alloy domain. Using this methodology we can computationally determine the evolution of the anode-cathode ratio and the corrosion current density for given organization of <b>anodic</b> and cathodic <b>phases</b> within an alloy domain. Most of the alloy structures that suffer corrosion are designed to transfer mechanical load. Hence, {{it is important to understand}} the impact of a stress field on the reaction kinetics that has been experimentally measured for an unstressed alloy. We used a stress-dependent chemical potential from the Gibbs-Duhem equation and used it to derive the reaction kinetics along the lines of the wellestablished Butler-Volmer model. In the presence of a stress field our model introduces an additional amplification-reduction factor to the forward and the reverse components of the Butler-Volmer kinetics. We further explored that the mechanical-electrochemical coupling produces a change in the shape of a dissolution front in addition to the change in the reaction rate. In our study we also examined the possible change in the reaction rate due stress-induced surface instabilities. Our calculations show that the combined shift in the reaction rate due to stress and surface patterns can be quite different from the change obtained due to the same stress field in the absence of patterns. 2018 - 01 - 2...|$|R
40|$|Cochlear {{implants}} {{stimulate the}} spiral ganglion cells (SGCs) with trains of charge-balanced current pulses. How the SGCs respond {{has often been}} studied with the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model. However, while the LIF model partially reproduces how SGCs respond to monophasic pulses, which are not charge balanced, it does not reproduce how the opposite-polarity phases of charge-balanced pulses interact to reduce their efficacy, and nor does it reproduce the temporal distributions of the evoked spikes, or how they depend {{on the strength of}} the stimulus. To address these limitations, I extended the LIF model by adding an initiation period to spiking, delaying spike emission by a stochastic, stimulus-dependent duration, so that the temporal distribution of the model reproduces that of the SGC. During its initiation, a spike may be cancelled by anodic current, thus allowing opposite-polarity phases to interact, reducing the stimulus’s efficacy in a way that reproduces how the thresholds of SGCs depend on the delay between the phases of cathodic-leading biphasic pulses. A spike may only be cancelled by anodic current after it has been initiated by cathodic current, and thus, cancellation only occurs in response to pulses in which a cathodic phase precedes an <b>anodic</b> <b>phase.</b> Reversing the phase order of a pulse therefore changes how the phases interact. To investigate whether phase order has a similar effect in the real neuron, I analysed the phase plane of a biophysical point-neuron model and found that the qualitative description of excitation depends on phase order {{in a way that is}} consistent with the theory of spike cancellation. That the phase order of a biphasic pulse affects how excitation occurs has direct consequences for cochlear implant coding strategies, as it affects whether the interactions between consecutive biphasic pulses are facilitatory or inhibitory...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe work {{function}} {{and with it}} the temperature of tungsten electrodes in HID lamps can be lowered and the lifetime of lamps increased by the gas phase emitter effect. A determination of the emitter effect of Cs and Ce is performed by phase resolved measurements of the electrode tip temperature T tip (ϕ), plasma temperature T pl (ϕ) and particle densities N (ϕ) by means of pyrometric, optical emission and broadband absorption spectroscopy in dependence on the operating frequency. The investigated HID lamps are ceramic metal halide lamps with transparent discharge vessels made of YAG, filled with a buffer gas consisting of Ar, Kr and predominantly Hg and seeded with CsI or CeI 3. In the YAG lamp seeded with CsI and CeI 3 as well as in a YAG lamp seeded with DyI 3 (corresponding results {{can be found in a}} preceding paper) a gas phase emitter effect is observed in the cathodic phase due to a Cs, Ce or Dy ion current. In the YAG lamp seeded with CsI the phase averaged coverage of the electrode surface with emitter atoms decreases and the electrode temperature rises with increasing frequency, whereas the emitter effect of Ce and Dy is extended to the <b>anodic</b> <b>phase,</b> which leads to a decreased average temperature T tip (ϕ) with increasing frequency. This different behaviour of the averaged values of T tip (ϕ) for increasing frequency is caused by the differing adsorption energies E a of the respective emitter materials. In spite of the influence of E a on the coverage of the electrode with emitter atoms, the cathodic gas phase emitter effect produces in the YAG lamps seeded with CsI, CeI 3 and DyI 3 a general reduction of the electrode tip temperature T tip (ϕ) in comparison to a YAG lamp with Hg filling only...|$|E
40|$|Background: Three {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} study the polarity sensitivity of the auditory nerve in CI users on different sites along the cochlea by means of Electrically Evoked Compound Action Potentials (ECAP) obtained with the masker-probe paradigm. A fourth behavioral experiment studied how current intensity affected polarity sensitivity. Methods: In experiment 1 were compared amplitudes and latencies of ECAP responses obtained with a biphasic cathodic- 1 st masker and either anodic- 1 st (BIA) or cathodic- 1 st (BIC) probes. In experiment 2 were used biphasic maskers with long inter-phase gaps (2. 9 ms) to study the effectiveness of each polarity by manipulating the polarity of the second phase (closest {{in time to the}} biphasic probe). In experiment 3 were used both masker and probe with the same polarity to ensure that differences in polarity sensitivity were not caused by the masker stimulating a different site than the probe. In experiment 4 the change of polarity sensitivity with current intensity was studied by means of a loudness-balancing task between pseudo-monophasic anodic- 1 st (PSA) and cathodic- 1 st (PSC) stimuli presented at different current intensities. Results: Experiment 1 showed that ECAP N 1 peak latencies were longer for BIC than for BIA probes on all electrodes under test. Absolute and relative differences in latency between BIA and BIC probes increased when the phase duration of both masker and probe increased. Experiment 2 showed that only an <b>anodic</b> <b>phase</b> could mask the probe response. In experiment 3 ECAP responses were only obtained when the polarity was anodic. Finally, experiment 4 showed that PSC stimuli require higher current intensities than PSA to reach the same loudness, and that this finding held for current levels ranging from 10 to 90 % of dynamic range. Conclusions: Results of all experiments suggest that the anodic polarity is the most effective one at different sites along the cochlea. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{electrically}} evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) are mainly elicited by the positive (<b>anodic)</b> <b>phase</b> of the masker and the probe, in a forward-masking paradigm. An issue about the underlying mechanisms is that ECAP responses may not necessarily reflect the action potentials traveling to the central auditory system (orthodromic), but may reflect the action potential traveling to the periphery. Here we studied whether the anodic polarity causes compound action potentials traveling orthodromically, and whether polarity sensitivity changes at different intensities in human users of the CII or HiRes 90 K cochlear implant (Advanced Bionics). We recorded electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses (EABR) which represent brainstem auditory activity and should reflect action potentials traveling orthodromically. Responses were recorded for standard symmetric (SYM), pseudomonophasic (PS), reversed pseudomonophasic (RPS) and reversed pseudomonophasic with inter-phase gap (6 ms) (RPS-IPG) pulses presented for both polarities. Amplitude and latency analyses were obtained for peak V. Additionally, sensitivity to polarity at different intensities was studied by means of a loudness-balancing task between pseudomonophasic anodic (PSA) and cathodic (PSC) stimuli. Results show that EABR to SYM pulses have similar latencies and amplitudes for both polarities. Responses to PS and RPS show higher amplitudes and shorter latencies when the high-amplitude is anodic than cathodic. Latency differences between PS and RPS responses are in agreement with the timing of the high-amplitude phase. Responses to the second phase of RPS-IPG pulses are similar to the ones obtained with PS and RPS, i. e. higher amplitudes and shorter latencies for anodic than for cathodic polarity. The loudness balancing task shows that PSC stimuli require higher intensities than PSA stimuli to reach the same loudness, and that this holds for current levels ranging from 10 to 100 % of dynamic range. Results indicate that anodic stimulation is more effective than cathodic stimulation even at low levels, and that this difference can be observed in EABRs that must result from auditory-nerve action potentials that travel orthodromically. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Bipolar {{stimulation}} (BP) {{has been}} suggested as a method to reduce the spread of current along the cochlea and {{increase the number of}} effective cochlear implant (CI) channels. However, behavioral measurements in BP mode have shown either similar or worse performance than in monopolar mode (MP). One possible limitation of BP stimulation is the bimodal spatial excitation that it may produce, with two peaks corresponding to the two stimulating electrodes. We have recently shown that the <b>anodic</b> <b>phase</b> of a pulse produces Electrically evoked Compound Action potentials (ECAP) more effectively than the cathodic phase. In the present study, we estimate and compare excitation patterns produced by different pulse shapes presented in BP mode by means of ECAP responses. Method: Spreads of excitations (SOEs) were estimated by means of ECAP responses obtained with the masker-probe paradigm. Three types of maskers were used: biphasic (BI), pseudomonophasic (PS) and delayed biphasic (DBI) pulses, which are biphasic pulses with a long inter-phase gap of 2. 1 ms. Maskers were loudness balanced and presented at a comfortable level either in BP+ 3 or in MP mode (only with BI pulses). BP maskers were presented on a fixed channel (electrodes 7 and 11) and MP maskers were presented on an electrode placed between the BP electrodes (electrode 9) of the array. For all maskers, the same BI probe was used in MP mode. SOEs were obtained by keeping the masker fixed and measuring the probe response on all electrodes of the array. In this way, ECAP responses are expected to be large when the fibers excited by the masker and probe overlap. For the BP maskers, two SOEs were estimated; one where the leading phase of the stimulus was anodic on the more apical electrode of the channel (electrode 7), and another where it was cathodic. Results: All SOEs obtained in BP mode depend on the leading polarity. This may reflect the combined effect of neural survival close to each electrode (one site may be more sensitive than the other) and pulse shape. DBI maskers allow us to study the effect of each polarity since the probe is presented after the last phase of the masker. SOEs showed higher excitation closer to the electrode that delivered the effective anodic masker. SOEs obtained with PS maskers tend to be more similar to the ones obtained with BI maskers but showed higher excitation when the main amplitude of the pulse was anodic. SOEs obtained in MP mode showed more excitation around the stimulating electrode. Conclusions: SOEs obtained in BP mode differ significantly (in amplitude and effective stimulation site) when the polarity is reversed. These results are also in agreement with our previous finding that the anodic polarity is the most effective one. The proposed method may help investigating, at least in part, the differences in excitation patterns between MP and BP mode, and it may also be used to evaluate, objectively, other novel pulse shapes in order to maximize selectivity. status: accepte...|$|E
