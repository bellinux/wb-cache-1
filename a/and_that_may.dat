5|$|Complex: These viruses {{possess a}} capsid that is neither purely helical nor purely icosahedral, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> possess extra {{structures}} such as protein tails or a complex outer wall. Some bacteriophages, such as Enterobacteria phage T4, have a complex structure consisting of an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail, which may have a hexagonal base plate with protruding protein tail fibres. This tail structure acts like a molecular syringe, attaching to the bacterial host and then injecting the viral genome into the cell.|$|E
5|$|The first {{tradition}} relates that Thomas {{served as}} a spatharios (staff officer) to Bardanes Tourkos, the monostrategos ("single-general", i.e. commander-in-chief) of the eastern themes, who in 803 rose in rebellion against Emperor Nikephoros I (r. 802–811). Alongside Thomas were two other young spatharioi in Bardanes's retinue, who formed a fraternal association: Leo the Armenian, the future Leo V, and Michael the Amorian, the future Michael II. According to a later hagiographic tradition, before launching his revolt, Bardanes, {{in the company of}} his three young protégés, is said to have visited a monk near Philomelion who was reputed to foresee the future. The monk predicted what would indeed happen: that Bardanes's revolt would fail, that Leo and Michael would both become emperors, and that Thomas would be acclaimed emperor and killed. When Bardanes did in fact rise up, he failed to win any widespread support. Leo and Michael soon abandoned him and defected to the imperial camp and were rewarded with senior military posts. Thomas alone remained loyal to Bardanes until his surrender. In the aftermath of Bardanes's failure, Thomas disappears from the sources for ten years. Bury suggests that he fled (for a second time according to his interpretation) to the Arabs, a view accepted by a number of other scholars, such as Romilly James Heald Jenkins. The historian Warren Treadgold, however, argues that Thomas stayed in the empire <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have even remained in active military service, and explains his obscurity by Thomas's association with Bardanes, which hampered his career.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} relics and remains have been {{interpreted}} {{as evidence that}} the Portuguese reached Australia. The primary evidence advanced to support this theory is the representation of the continent of Jave la Grande, which appears on a series of French world maps, the Dieppe maps, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>may,</b> in part, be based on Portuguese charts. However, most historians do not accept this theory, and the interpretation of the Dieppe maps is highly contentious.|$|E
25|$|Hameroff {{provided}} a hypothesis that microtubules would be suitable hosts for quantum behavior. Microtubules {{are composed of}} tubulin protein dimer subunits. The dimers each have hydrophobic pockets that are 8nm apart <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> contain delocalized pi electrons. Tubulins have other smaller non-polar regions that contain pi electron-rich indole rings separated by only about 2nm. Hameroff proposed that these electrons are close enough to become entangled. Hameroff originally suggested the tubulin-subunit electrons would form a Bose–Einstein condensate, but this was discredited. He then proposed a Frohlich condensate, a hypothetical coherent oscillation of dipolar molecules. However, this too was experimentally discredited.|$|E

25|$|February 8, 2007 was a {{very cold}} day, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have been a {{contributing}} factor in the low voter turnout. When the polling stations closed at 8:00p.m., it took two hours to count the ballots and declare Ferreira the winner. At his victory party, Donald C. MacDonald (the former Ontario CCF/NDP leader from the 1953 to 1970 and local area MPP for almost thirty years), joined Ferreira onstage in a symbolic passing of the generational torch ceremony. One of the coincidences of this NDP election victory was, that it came almost exactly 65 years to the day, when the CCF first won York South, in the February 9, 1942 by-election. In that election Joseph Noseworthy won a surprise victory, similar to Ferreira's.|$|E
25|$|This stork shows unique nesting {{behaviours}} {{not observed}} {{in many other}} storks <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> reflect its adaptation to nesting on the ground. For example, {{it is one of}} a minority of stork species to perform a distinct Nest Covering Display to protect nestlings from potential predators. During this display, the nesting stork droops its wings along its sides with a strongly cocked tail and erect feathers on the head and neck; accompanied by a clattering of the bill that is pointed almost vertically downward. Another nesting behaviour apparently unique to the maguari stork is the Mock Resting display. Here, during the presence of an intruder near the nest, the individual stands motionless with its back strongly arched, neck retracted, and wings and bill folded almost vertically downward. This behaviour likely evolved as an adaptation to ground nesting in dense vegetation because the posture maintained by the nesting bird amongst the grass and reeds may render it difficult to see by the intruder; and at the same time, the bird is poised ready to attack.|$|E

500|$|At the time, {{popular music}} at large {{was seen as}} {{becoming}} more experimental. Gouldman's arrangement was perceived as creating an exotic sound. [...] Yardbirds' drummer Jim McCarty explained that [...] "the riff on the [...] demo suggested a sitar" [...] and that the group's manager, Giorgio Gomelsky, hired a sitar and a tabla player for a recording session. Beck biographer Martin Power notes that [...] "For Your Love" [...] had been made more memorable by a prominent harpsichord part (played by Brian Auger) <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have influenced Gomelsky's decision. [...] Beck also notes this parallel. The use of sitar was a new approach. Several months later, the Beatles recorded [...] "Norwegian Wood", which is often recognised as the first rock song released to incorporate a sitar part. Session guitar player Jimmy Page, who later joined the Yardbirds, was working in an adjacent studio and attended the session.|$|E

Timothy Dalton's Bond is a serious bloke who swallows his words and approaches his job with responsibility and humanity, and eschews promiscuity – Dirtless Harry. You get the feeling that on his off nights, he might curl up with the Reader's Digest and catch an episode of Moonlighting – he'd try to memorize the jokes – before nodding off under the influence of Ovaltine. The British reviews of The Living Daylights have been laudatory, perhaps because this Bond is the most British of all, if British is to be understood as a synonym for reserved".|$|E

500|$|Some modern authors {{suggest that}} Druitt was {{dismissed}} {{because he was}} a homosexual or pederast <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have driven him to suicide. One speculation is that the money found on his body was going to be used for payment to a blackmailer.
