40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>aid</b> <b>and</b> FDI {{and its effect}} on economic growth What is the {{relationship between}} <b>aid</b> <b>and</b> FDI and is there an enhanced combined effect of both on economic growth? This paper empirically assesses the contribution of FDI <b>and</b> <b>aid</b> to economic growth in a panel of 139 developing countries over 23 years (1990 - 2012). This study makes a distinction between foreign <b>aid</b> <b>and</b> foreign infrastructure <b>aid.</b> The latter is foreign aid, which is purely targeted at infrastructural developments of a country. The relationship between <b>aid</b> <b>and</b> FDI is also tested in this paper. Furthermore, this study tries to find whether there is an enhanced combined effect of FDI <b>and</b> <b>aid</b> on growth. This study finds some result to support a significant positive relationship between foreign <b>aid</b> <b>and</b> FDI. A second result is that the positive effect of aid seems to be stronger when using the infrastructure aid variable. We could not verify that more aid combined with more FDI lead to a higher growth. The above findings are important, particularly in light of th...|$|R
