Comparison of lung <b>age</b> <b>equations</b> by regression analysis used an independent dataset of 3, 206 randomly selected community-dwelling adults aged > 18 years in the North West Adelaide Health Study. RESULTS: The more recent <b>equations</b> estimated lung <b>age</b> as greater than chronological age as lung function decreased, whereas the oldest <b>equations</b> estimated lung <b>age</b> as less than chronological age until lung function was severely limited.

40|$|Traditionally the “average” age of {{multiple}} (U–Th) /He analyses has been calculated as the arithmetic mean age. This paper presents three alternative methods: (a) in analogy with the fission track method, the pooled age is calculated {{by adding the}} respective U, Th and He abundances of several grains together, thereby generating one “synthetic” multi-grain measurement; (b) the isochron age is the slope of helium concentration versus present-day helium production; (c) the central age is computed from the geometric mean U–Th–He composition. Each of these methods is more appropriate than the arithmetic mean age in certain applications. The pooled age is useful for comparing single-grain with multi-grain analyses, while the isochron age {{can be used to}} detect “parentless helium”. The central age is the most accurate and statistically robust way to calculate a sample average of several single-grain analyses because U, Th and He form a ternary system and only the central age adequately captures the statistics of this compositional data space. Fortunately, the expected difference between the arithmetic mean age and the central age is relatively small, less than 1 % if the external age reproducibility is better than 15 % (1 σ). Finally, the (U–Th) /He <b>age</b> <b>equation</b> is visualized on a ternary diagram to illustrate that the α-ejection correction should be applied before, and not after age calculation, in order to avoid a partial linearization of the <b>age</b> <b>equation.</b> Including Sm as a fourth parent element precludes a straightforward visualization of the <b>age</b> <b>equation</b> on a two-dimensional plot.

In all countries considered (n = 32), the second-order term of age is negative, indicating {{a decrease in the}} rate of rise of log cancer mortality at older age. This could be explained by a lesser accuracy of the diagnosis of cancer at older age, by selective survival of subjects resistant to cancer, by a cohort effect, or by a decrease in the rate of growth of cancer al older age. The decrease in the rate of rise of cancer mortality, after 65 years of age occurs in all countries and applies to nearly all cancers except breast cancer in women after 75 years of age. A high cancer mortality in a country is characterized by a low intercept and a steep slope of the log mortality-log <b>age</b> <b>equation.</b> These parameters are influenced by dietary fat intake in men and women, with saturated fat increasing total cancer mortality and the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat and the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fat decreasing it. The data on dietary fat were obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) food balance sheets (n = 32) and from dietary sunveys (n = 21).

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldBACKGROUND: The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare three different equations to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on serum creatinine (SCr) and to estimate the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the Icelandic population. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using data from the Reykjavik Heart Study. GFR was estimated with three equations: Equation I was based on 1 /SCr; Equation II based on the Cockcroft-Gault equation; and Equation III was the modified MDRD equation. The eGFR calculated with Equation III and proteinuria were used to estimate the prevalence of CKD. The prevalence was age-standardized to the truncated world population. We used chi-square and ANCOVA to compare the group with low eGFR to age-matched controls. RESULTS: The subjects consisted of 9229 males and 10, 027 females, aged 33 - 85 years. The equations performed very differently. Equation I showed women with higher eGFR than men and little change with <b>age.</b> <b>Equation</b> II showed men with higher eGFR than women and marked decline in eGFR with <b>age.</b> <b>Equation</b> III was similar to Equation II but the decline in eGFR with age was not as great. Regardless of the equation used, most subjects (63. 7 - 80. 7 %) had an eGFR in the range of 60 - 89 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2. Using Equation III, age-standardized prevalence of low eGFR for the population aged 35 - 80 + years was estimated to be 4. 7 and 11. 6 % for men and women, respectively. The proportion of subjects with eGFR < 60 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 increased with advancing age. An additional 2. 39 % of men and 0. 89 % of women had proteinuria. The prevalence of renal and cardiovascular risk factors including proteinuria, hypertension, lipid abnormalities and markers of inflammation was higher among those with low eGFR than age-matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: GFR estimates and the prevalence of CKD are dependent on the equation used to calculate eGFR. Unexpectedly, a low proportion of the Icelandic population had normal kidney function according to the eGFR regardless of the equation used.
