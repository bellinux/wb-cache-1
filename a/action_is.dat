The project began when Dylan's office approached McPherson and suggested creating a play using Dylan songs. The drama received favorable reviews.|$|E
5|$|English {{does not}} have a morphologised future tense. Futurity of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> {{expressed}} periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs will or shall. Many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb be going to.|$|E
5|$|Mutations in the TREM2 gene {{have been}} {{associated}} with a 3 to 5 times higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. A suggested mechanism of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> that when TREM2 is mutated, white blood cells in the brain are no longer able to control the amount of beta amyloid present.|$|E

5|$|Two-level utilitarianism is {{virtually}} {{a synthesis of}} the opposing doctrines of act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism. Act utilitarianism states that in all cases the morally right <b>action</b> <b>is</b> the one which produces the most pleasure, whereas rule utilitarianism states that the morally right <b>action</b> <b>is</b> {{the one that is}} in accordance with a moral rule whose general observance would create the most happiness. In terms of two-level utilitarianism, act utilitarianism can be likened to the 'critical' level of moral thinking, and rule utilitarianism to the 'intuitive' level.|$|E
5|$|Utilitarianism {{is a type}} of consequentialist ethical theory. According to such theories, {{only the}} outcome of an <b>action</b> <b>is</b> morally {{relevant}} (this contrasts with deontology, according to which moral actions flow from duties or motives). Utilitarianism is a combination of consequentialism and the philosophical position hedonism, which states that pleasure, or happiness, is the only good worth pursuing. Therefore, since only the consequences of an action matter, and only happiness matters, only happiness that is the consequence of an <b>action</b> <b>is</b> morally relevant. There are similarities with preference utilitarianism, where utility is defined as individual preference rather than pleasure.|$|E

5|$|Utilitarians {{believe that}} an <b>action</b> <b>is</b> right if it {{produces}} the best possible state of affairs. Traditional utilitarianism treats this as a claim that people should try {{to ensure that their}} actions maximise overall happiness or pleasure.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} is the electric action which uses low voltage DC to control the key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control the action indirectly through air pressure valves (pneumatics), {{in which case the}} <b>action</b> <b>is</b> electro-pneumatic. In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet. When electricity operates the action directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is commonly referred to as direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet's armature carries a disc pallet.|$|E
5|$|Although {{set in a}} hospital, it uses {{no medical}} storylines; the <b>action</b> <b>is</b> {{produced}} {{by a series of}} soap opera-style twists and turns in the personal lives of the characters. They proceed through a series of often absurd sketch-like scenes, or by sequences where the film is slowed down or sped up, often emphasizing the body language of the characters. The show had eight writers. Two series were made by the Talkback Thames production company for Channel 4.|$|E

40|$|Davidson famously {{contended that}} all <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> {{movements}} of the agent's body. It has been objected, however, that Davidson's view is incompatible with his own definition of primitive actions. This paper argues that this objection {{is based on an}} incorrect reading of Davidson's argument. I will show that by reading 'movements', in 'all <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> bodily movements', transitively, Davidson's definition of primitive actions ceases to contradict with his thesis that all <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> bodily movements...|$|R
5|$|Amazon {{lost three}} in the battle and six in her wreck, with 15 wounded, while Indefatigable did not lose a single man killed, {{suffering}} only 18wounded. The discrepancy in losses during the <b>action</b> <b>is</b> likely due to the extreme difficulty the French crew had in aiming their guns given their ship's instability in heavy seas.|$|E
5|$|Another {{exception}} to the general rule that courts will generally only judicially review errors of law is where <b>action</b> <b>is</b> taken or a decision is {{made on the basis}} of no evidence, a lack of sufficient evidence, or an error of material fact. In such situations, intervention by the High Court is warranted as the action or decision is factually unsustainable.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{divergent}} {{evolution of}} function (and even the triad's nucleophile), catalytic triads show {{some of the}} best examples of convergent evolution. Chemical constraints on catalysis have led to the same catalytic solution independently evolving in at least 23 separate superfamilies. Their mechanism of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> consequently one of the best studied in biochemistry.|$|E

The reduction in sulfur will also prevent an estimated 8,300premature deaths, 5,500cases of chronic bronchitis and 17,600cases of acute bronchitis in children. In addition, an estimated 360,000asthma attacks and 386,000cases of respiratory symptoms in asthmatic children will also be avoided every year.|$|E
5|$|Dirge of Cerberus is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} third-person shooter. Battles occur in real-time, with the HUD displaying {{information such as}} Vincent's hit points and magic points, the currently selected item and quantity thereof, and a cross-hair to aid in targeting enemies. The <b>action</b> <b>is</b> viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective similar to Resident Evil 4, although players can switch to a first-person perspective if they wish. Defeating enemies yields EXP, {{and at the end}} of each stage, the player can either use that EXP to level up, increasing Vincent's stats, or convert it to Gil (the in-game currency), which can then be used to purchase items and equipment upgrades.|$|E
5|$|However, {{justiciability}} is {{a concept}} that eludes precise categorization or definition, and this has caused disquiet amongst some critics. The implication is that there may be some unfairness where questionable executive action remains unchallenged. Nonetheless, the concept of justiciability is useful in determining the likelihood of whether an executive <b>action</b> <b>is</b> within the purview of judicial review.|$|E

5|$|In {{languages}} {{other than}} English, its name also reflects the action it resembles. Sports journalist Alejandro Cisternas, from Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, {{compiled a list}} of these names. In most cases, they either refer to the kick's scissor-like motion, such as the French ciseaux retourné (returned scissor) and the Greek psalidaki, or to its bicycle-like action, such as the Portuguese pontapé de bicicleta. In other languages, the nature of the <b>action</b> <b>is</b> described: German Fallrückzieher (falling backward kick), Polish przewrotka (overturn kick), Dutch omhaal (turnaround drag), and Italian rovesciata (reversed kick).|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that a person lacks standing, there is a {{possibility}} that he or she may be able to ask the Attorney-General to allow him or her to bring a relator action. In this scenario, the Attorney-General would be the nominal plaintiff in the judicial review proceedings, but the case would actually be conducted by the individual. Bringing a relator <b>action</b> <b>is</b> one means of circumventing the requirement of standing on the part of the individual applicant, because the Attorney-General has an interest in upholding the law for the public benefit.|$|E
5|$|Jim Reardon {{directed}} the episode and has noted {{he remembers the}} episode for several scenes in which the <b>action</b> <b>is</b> viewed through windows, such as when Homer prank calls the dean.

40|$|Cultures {{differ in}} many {{important}} ways, but one trait {{appears to be}} universally valued: prosociality. For one’s reputation, around the world, it pays {{to be nice to}} others. However, recent research with American participants finds that evaluations of prosocial <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> asymmetric—relatively selfish <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> evaluated according to the magnitude of selfishness but evaluations of relatively generous <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> less sensitive to magnitude. Extremely generous <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> judged roughly as positively as modestly generous actions, but extremely selfish <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> judged much more negatively than modestly selfish actions (Klein & Epley, 2014). Here we test whether this asymmetry in evaluations of prosociality is culture-specific. Across 7 countries, 1, 240 participants evaluated actors giving various amounts of money to a stranger. Along with relatively minor cross-cultural differences in evaluations of generous actions, we find cross-cultural similarities in the asymmetry in evaluations of prosociality. We discuss implications for how reputational inferences can enable the cooperation necessary for successful societies...|$|R
