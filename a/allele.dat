5|$|Alleles at a locus may be {{dominant}} or recessive; dominant alleles {{give rise}} to their corresponding phenotypes when paired with any other <b>allele</b> for the same trait, whereas recessive alleles {{give rise to}} their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same <b>allele.</b> If you know the genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which alleles are dominant and which are recessive. For example, if the <b>allele</b> specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the <b>allele</b> specifying short stems, then pea plants that inherit one tall <b>allele</b> from one parent and one short <b>allele</b> from the other parent will also have tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently {{in the production of}} gametes, or germ cells, ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known genetic disorders) it does not include the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} organism's phenotype {{results from}} both its genotype {{and the influence}} from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the phenotypic variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation. The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular <b>allele</b> will become more or less prevalent relative {{to other forms of}} that gene. Variation disappears when a new <b>allele</b> reaches the point of fixation—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral <b>allele</b> entirely.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{genetic drift}} {{is the only}} {{evolutionary}} force acting on an <b>allele,</b> {{at any given time}} the probability that an <b>allele</b> will eventually become fixed in the population is simply its frequency in the population at that time. For example, if the frequency p for <b>allele</b> A is 75% and the frequency q for <b>allele</b> B is 25%, then given unlimited time the probability A will ultimately become fixed in the population is 75% and the probability that B will become fixed is 25%.|$|E
5|$|From a Neo-Darwinian perspective, {{evolution}} {{occurs when}} there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms. For example, the <b>allele</b> for black colour in a population of moths becoming more common. Mechanisms {{that can lead to}} changes in <b>allele</b> frequencies include natural selection, genetic drift, genetic hitchhiking, mutation and gene flow.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of genetic drift can be illustrated with a simplified example. Consider {{a very large}} colony of bacteria isolated in a drop of solution. The bacteria are genetically identical except for a single gene with two alleles labeled A and B. A and B are neutral alleles meaning {{that they do not}} affect the bacteria's ability to survive and reproduce; all bacteria in this colony are equally likely to survive and reproduce. Suppose that half the bacteria have <b>allele</b> A and the other half have <b>allele</b> B. Thus A and B each have <b>allele</b> frequency 1/2.|$|E
5|$|W8 {{is found}} in one Icelandic horse with sabino-like white spotting, mottling, and roaning. Both parents and four {{maternal}} half-siblings, all non-white, were found without the W8 <b>allele.</b> The W8 <b>allele</b> is also a splice site mutation (c.2222-1G>A), located on Intron15.|$|E
5|$|When some {{component}} of a trait is heritable, selection alters the frequencies of the different alleles, or variants of the gene that produces the variants of the trait. Selection {{can be divided into}} three classes, {{on the basis of its}} effect on <b>allele</b> frequencies: directional, stabilizing, and purifying selection. Directional selection occurs when an <b>allele</b> has a greater fitness than others, so that it increases in frequency, gaining an increasing share in the population. This process can continue until the <b>allele</b> is fixed and the entire population shares the fitter phenotype. Far more common is stabilizing selection, which lowers the frequency of alleles that have a deleterious effect on the phenotype – that is, produce organisms of lower fitness. This process can continue until the <b>allele</b> is eliminated from the population. Purifying selection conserves functional genetic features, such as protein-coding genes or regulatory sequences, over time by selective pressure against deleterious variants.|$|E
5|$|When the <b>allele</b> {{frequency}} is very small, drift {{can also}} overpower selection even in large populations. For example, while disadvantageous mutations are usually eliminated quickly in large populations, new advantageous mutations {{are almost as}} vulnerable to loss through genetic drift as are neutral mutations. Not until the <b>allele</b> frequency for the advantageous mutation reaches a certain threshold will genetic drift have no effect.|$|E
5|$|A genetic hybrid carries two {{different}} alleles {{of the same}} gene, where for instance one <b>allele</b> may code for a lighter coat colour than the other.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-known}} <b>allele</b> {{found only}} in the Bengal subspecies produces the white tiger, a colour variant first recorded in the early 19th century and found in an estimated one in 10,000 natural births. Genetically, whiteness is recessive: a cub is white only when both parents carry the <b>allele</b> for whiteness. It is not albinism, pigment being evident in the white tiger's stripes and in their blue eyes. The causative mutation changes a single amino acid in the transporter protein SLC45A2.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{differences}} exist between different racial groups which affect {{the risk of}} developing alcohol dependence. For example, there are differences between African, East Asian and Indo-racial groups in how they metabolize alcohol. These genetic factors are believed to, in part, explain the differing rates of alcohol dependence among racial groups. The alcohol dehydrogenase <b>allele</b> ADH1 B*3 causes a more rapid metabolism of alcohol. The <b>allele</b> ADH1 B*3 is only found in those of African descent and certain Native American tribes. African Americans and Native Americans with this <b>allele</b> have a reduced risk of developing alcoholism. Native Americans however, have a significantly higher rate of alcoholism than average; it is unclear why this is the case. Other risk factors such as cultural environmental effects e.g. trauma have been proposed to explain the higher rates of alcoholism among Native Americans compared to alcoholism levels in caucasians.|$|E
5|$|Genetic drift (also {{known as}} allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect after {{biologist}} Sewall Wright) {{is the change}} in the frequency of an existing gene variant (<b>allele)</b> in a population due to random sampling of organisms. The alleles in the offspring are a sample of those in the parents, and chance has a role in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces. A population's <b>allele</b> frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form. Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce genetic variation.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in the risk that a person will develop PTE; people with the ApoE-ε4 <b>allele</b> may be at higher risk for PTE. The {{haptoglobin}} Hp2-2 <b>allele</b> may be another genetic risk factor, possibly because it binds hemoglobin poorly and thus allows more iron to escape and damage tissues. However, most studies have found that having family members with epilepsy does not significantly increase the risk of PTS, suggesting that genetics are not a strong risk factor.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's {{disease has}} {{autosomal}} dominant inheritance, meaning that an affected individual typically inherits one {{copy of the}} gene with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (the mutant <b>allele)</b> from an affected parent. Since penetrance of the mutation is very high, {{those who have a}} mutated copy of the gene will have the disease. In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutant <b>allele</b> and therefore being affected with the disorder (see figure). This probability is sex-independent.|$|E
5|$|It is even {{possible}} {{that in any}} one generation no marbles of a particular colour are chosen, meaning they have no offspring. In this example, if no red marbles are selected, the jar representing the new generation contains only blue offspring. If this happens, the red <b>allele</b> has been lost permanently in the population, while the remaining blue <b>allele</b> has become fixed: all future generations are entirely blue. In small populations, fixation can occur {{in just a few}} generations.|$|E
5|$|Mathematical {{models of}} genetic drift can be {{designed}} using either branching processes or a diffusion equation describing changes in <b>allele</b> frequency in an idealised population.|$|E
5|$|Most {{cases of}} Alzheimer's disease do not exhibit autosomal-dominant {{inheritance}} and are termed sporadic AD, in which environmental and genetic differences may act as risk factors. The best known genetic risk {{factor is the}} inheritance of the ε4 <b>allele</b> of the apolipoprotein E (APOE). Between 40 and 80% of people with AD possess at least one APOEε4 <b>allele.</b> The APOEε4 <b>allele</b> {{increases the risk of}} the disease by three times in heterozygotes and by 15 times in homozygotes. Like many human diseases, environmental effects and genetic modifiers result in incomplete penetrance. For example, certain Nigerian populations do not show the relationship between dose of APOEε4 and incidence or age-of-onset for Alzheimer's disease seen in other human populations. Early attempts to screen up to 400 candidate genes for association with late-onset sporadic AD (LOAD) resulted in a low yield. More recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found 19 areas in genes that appear to affect the risk. These genes include: CASS4, CELF1, FERMT2, HLA-DRB5, INPP5D, MEF2C, NME8, PTK2B, SORL1, ZCWPW1, SlC24A4, CLU, PICALM, CR1, BIN1, MS4A, ABCA7, EPHA1, and CD2AP.|$|E
5|$|Random {{changes in}} <b>allele</b> {{frequencies}} {{can also be}} caused by effects other than sampling error, for example random changes in selection pressure.|$|E
5|$|The Hardy–Weinberg {{principle}} {{states that}} within sufficiently large populations, the <b>allele</b> frequencies remain constant {{from one generation}} to the next unless the equilibrium is disturbed by migration, genetic mutations, or selection.|$|E
5|$|The law {{of large}} numbers predicts that when the {{absolute}} number of copies of the <b>allele</b> is small (e.g., in small populations), the magnitude of drift on <b>allele</b> frequencies per generation is larger. The magnitude of drift {{is large enough to}} overwhelm selection at any <b>allele</b> frequency when the selection coefficient is less than 1 divided by the effective population size. Non-adaptive evolution resulting from the product of mutation and genetic drift is therefore considered to be a consequential mechanism of evolutionary change primarily within small, isolated populations. The mathematics of genetic drift depend on the effective population size, {{but it is not clear}} how this is related to the actual number of individuals in a population. Genetic linkage to other genes that are under selection can reduce the effective population size experienced by a neutral <b>allele.</b> With a higher recombination rate, linkage decreases and with it this local effect on effective population size. This effect is visible in molecular data as a correlation between local recombination rate and genetic diversity, and negative correlation between gene density and diversity at noncoding DNA regions. Stochasticity associated with linkage to other genes that are under selection is not the same as sampling error, and is sometimes known as genetic draft in order to distinguish it from genetic drift.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} of GWA studies is the case-control setup, which compares two {{large groups of}} individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped {{for the majority of}} common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million or more. For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the <b>allele</b> frequency is significantly altered between the case and the control group. In such setups, the fundamental unit for reporting effect sizes is the odds ratio. The odds ratio is the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are the odds of disease for individuals having a specific <b>allele</b> and the odds of disease for individuals who do not have that same <b>allele.</b> When the <b>allele</b> frequency in the case group is much higher than in the control group, the odds ratio is higher than 1, and vice versa for lower <b>allele</b> frequency. Additionally, a P-value for the significance of the odds ratio is typically calculated using a simple chi-squared test. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease.|$|E
5|$|W5 {{is found}} in Thoroughbreds {{descending}} from Puchilingui, a 1984 stallion with sabino-like white spotting and roaning. Horses with the W5 <b>allele</b> exhibit a huge range in white phenotype: a few have been pure white or near-white, while others have sabino-like spotting limited to high, irregular stockings and blazes that covered the face. Twenty-two members of this family were studied, and the 12 {{with some degree of}} dominant white spotting were found to have a deletion in exon 15 (p.T732QfsX9), {{in the form of a}} frameshift mutation. A later study found that the members of this family with the greatest depigmentation were compound heterozygotes who also carried the W20 <b>allele.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{multiple}} different alleles for a gene {{are present}} in a species's population it is called polymorphic. Most different alleles are functionally equivalent, however some alleles can give rise to different phenotypic traits. A gene's most common <b>allele</b> is called the wild type, and rare alleles are called mutants. The genetic variation in relative frequencies of different alleles in a population is due to both natural selection and genetic drift. The wild-type <b>allele</b> {{is not necessarily the}} ancestor of less common alleles, nor is it necessarily fitter.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{two studies}} further pinpointed the {{responsible}} region to chromosome 11 and a 4.5-Mb covering chromosomal rearrangement. The scientists {{were able to}} show that the first genetic change happened 3.8 million years ago on the resident chromosome, when a part of it broke off and was reintroduced in the wrong direction. This inversion created the faeder <b>allele.</b> About 500,000 years ago another rare recombination event of faeder and resident <b>allele</b> in the very same inverted region lead to the satellite <b>allele.</b> The 4.5 Mb inversion covers 90 genes, {{one of them is the}} centromere coding gene N- CENPN-, which is located exactly at one of the inversion breakpoints. The inactivation of the gene has severe deleterious effects and pedigree data of a captive ruff colony suggests that the inversion is homozygous lethal. Over the course of the past 3.8 million years, further mutations have accumulated within the inversion i.e. three deletions ranging from 3.3 to 17.6 kb. Two of these deletions remove evolutionary highly conserved elements close to two genes- HSD17B2 and SDR42E1-both holding important roles in metabolism of steroid hormones. Hormone measurements around mating time showed that whereas residents have a sharp increase of testosterone, faeders and satellites only experience higher androstenedione levels, a substance which is considered an intermediate in testosterone biosynthesis. The authors conclude that one or more of the deletions act as a cis-acting regulatory mutation which is altering the expression of one or both genes and eventually contributes to the different male phenotypes and behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Preserved {{woolly mammoth}} fur is orange-brown, {{but this is}} {{believed}} to be an artefact from the bleaching of pigment during burial. The amount of pigmentation varied from hair to hair and also within each hair. A 2006 study sequenced the Mc1r gene (which influences hair colour in mammals) from woolly mammoth bones. Two alleles were found: a dominant (fully active) and a recessive (partially active) one. In mammals, recessive Mc1r alleles result in light hair. Mammoths born with at least one copy of the dominant <b>allele</b> would have had dark coats, while those with two copies of the recessive <b>allele</b> would have had light coats. A 2011 study showed that light individuals would have been rare. A 2014 study instead indicated that the colouration of an individual varied from non-pigmented on the overhairs, bi-coloured, non-pigmented and mixed red-brown guard hairs, and non-pigmented underhairs, which would give a light overall appearance.|$|E
5|$|Some {{forms of}} {{balancing}} selection do {{not result in}} fixation, but maintain an <b>allele</b> at intermediate frequencies in a population. This can occur in diploid species (with pairs of chromosomes) when heterozygous individuals (with just one copy of the <b>allele)</b> have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals (with two copies). This is called heterozygote advantage or over-dominance, of which the best-known example is the resistance to malaria in humans heterozygous for sickle-cell anaemia. Maintenance of allelic variation can also occur through disruptive or diversifying selection, which favours genotypes that depart from the average in either direction (that is, the opposite of over-dominance), and {{can result in a}} bimodal distribution of trait values. Finally, balancing selection can occur through frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of one particular phenotype depends on the distribution of other phenotypes in the population. The principles of game theory have been applied to understand the fitness distributions in these situations, particularly in the study of kin selection and the evolution of reciprocal altruism.|$|E
5|$|The first {{successful}} GWAS {{was published in}} 2005. It investigated patients with age-related macular degeneration and found two SNPs with significantly altered <b>allele</b> frequency compared to healthy controls. , {{hundreds or thousands of}} individuals are tested in a typical GWA study, over 3,000 human GWA studies have examined over 1,800 diseases and traits, and thousands of SNP associations have been found.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} sickle cell trait on malaria {{immunity}} illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs {{that have occurred}} because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes {{a change in the}} hemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow capillaries; however, when the modified hemoglobinS molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape. In these strands the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are homozygous (with two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin beta <b>allele)</b> have sickle-cell anaemia, while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal <b>allele</b> and one normal <b>allele)</b> experience resistance to malaria without severe anemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavor the trait's survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the benefits provided by the heterozygous form.|$|E
5|$|The major {{effect of}} the apolipoprotein A5 gene (and its variants) is on plasma {{triglyceride}} levels. Minor alleles (C1131 and Trp19) are primarily associated with the elevation of plasma triglyceride levels. The most extensive information available has been drawn from Caucasian populations, particularly {{in relation to the}} rs662799 SNP. Here, one minor <b>allele</b> is associated with an approximate 0,25mmol/L increase of plasma TG levels. A similar effect is associated with the Trp19 <b>allele,</b> even though it has not been confirmed by a huge number of studies. Original studies have further described that the strongest effect of APOA5 polymorphisms on plasma TG levels is observed among Hispanics, with only minor effects detected among Africans. Among Asians, the effect on plasma TG levels is similar that found among Caucasians. Generally, studies have suggested significant interethnic differences and in some cases sex-dependent associations as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between the short and long <b>allele</b> of the 5-HTTLPR gene has been examined in OCD, and a meta analysis found that the S <b>allele</b> was associated with OCD in females only. A systematic review found that while neither <b>allele</b> was associated with OCD overall, in caucasians the L <b>allele</b> was associated with OCD. Another meta analysis observed an increased risk in those with the homozygous S <b>allele,</b> but found the LS genotype to be inversely associated with OCD.|$|E
25|$|The {{two common}} O alleles, O01 and O02, share their first 261 {{nucleotides}} {{with the group}} A <b>allele</b> A01. However, unlike the group A <b>allele,</b> a guanosine base is subsequently deleted. A premature stop codon results from this frame-shift mutation. This variant is found worldwide, and likely predates human migration from Africa. The O01 <b>allele</b> is considered to predate the O02 <b>allele.</b>|$|E
25|$|Inclusive fitness {{differs from}} {{individual}} fitness by including {{the ability of}} an <b>allele</b> in one individual to promote the survival and/or reproduction of other individuals that share that <b>allele,</b> in preference to individuals with a different <b>allele.</b> One mechanism of inclusive fitness is kin selection.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} this mixing depend on the types (the alleles) of the gene. If the father has two copies of an <b>allele</b> for red hair, and the mother has two copies for brown hair, all their {{children}} get the two alleles that give different instructions, one for red hair and one for brown. The hair color of these children depends on how these alleles work together. If one <b>allele</b> dominates the instructions from another, {{it is called the}} dominant <b>allele,</b> and the <b>allele</b> that is overridden is called the recessive <b>allele.</b> In the case of a daughter with alleles for both red and brown hair, brown is dominant and she ends up with brown hair.|$|E
25|$|C/CCr heterozygotes {{have one}} cream <b>allele,</b> and one {{wildtype}} non-cream <b>allele.</b> Only red pigment {{in the hair}} is diluted, as seen in buckskins and palominos.|$|E
25|$|In the end, a workshop, {{based on}} sequence, decides which new <b>allele</b> goes into which {{serogroup}} either by sequence or by reactivity. Once the sequence is verified, it is assigned a number. For example, a new <b>allele</b> of B44 {{may get a}} serotype (i.e. B44) and <b>allele</b> ID i.e. B*44:65, {{as it is the}} 65th B44 <b>allele</b> discovered. Marsh et al. (2005) can be considered a code book for HLA serotypes and genotypes, and a new book biannually with monthly updates in Tissue Antigens.|$|E
25|$|Wright's {{mathematical}} work described fitness as {{a function}} of <b>allele</b> frequencies. Here, each dimension describes an <b>allele</b> frequency at a different gene, and goes between 0 and 1.|$|E
