Three new editions of the piano version were prepared celebrating Rossin's 200th anniversary in 1992: two critical editions by Oxford and Carus-Verlag, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> Novello, with only one piano part.|$|E
5|$|Canterbury, {{along with}} Whitstable and Herne Bay, {{is in the}} City of Canterbury local {{government}} district. The city's urban area consists of the six electoral wards of Barton, Blean Forest, Northgate, St Stephens, Westgate, and Wincheap. These wards have eleven of the fifty seats on the Canterbury City Council. Six of these seats are held by the Liberal Democrats, four by the Conservatives <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> Labour.|$|E
5|$|Christoph Wolff notes a {{similarity}} between the fugue theme <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> Johann Hugo von Wilderer, whose mass Bach had probably copied and performed in Leipzig before 1731. Wilderer's mass also has a slow introduction, a duet as the second movement and a motet in stile antico, similar to late Renaissance music, as the third movement. Bach based the work on a composition in C minor, as mistakes in the copying process show.|$|E

5|$|France's {{intervention}} in the coup was openly applauded by the Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Niger, and Upper Volta. In fact, France was barely criticised at all in Africa, other than a mild response by Dahomey <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> the Democratic Republic of Congo. The matter was not discussed at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers of the OAU, held on 24 February–29 February in Lagos. The revolutionary movement in French Africa immediately retrogressed following the coup.|$|E
5|$|Herne Bay, {{along with}} Whitstable and Canterbury, {{is in the}} City of Canterbury local {{government}} district. The town contains the five electoral wards of Heron, Herne and Broomfield, Greenhill and Eddington, West Bay and Reculver. These wards have thirteen of the fifty seats on the Canterbury City council. As at the 2011 local elections, twelve of those seats were held by the Conservatives <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> the Liberal Democrats.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the eleven}} poems the Gosen Wakashū {{attributed}} to Narihira, several were really by others—for example, two were actually by Fujiwara no Nakahira <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> Ōshikōchi no Mitsune. The Shin Kokinshū and later court anthologies attribute more poems to Narihira, {{but many of}} these were likely misunderstood to have been written by him because of their appearance in The Tales of Ise. Some of these were probably composed after Narihira's death. Combined, poems attributed to Narihira in court anthologies total 87.|$|E

At the 2007 local elections, two of those seats were won by the Conservative Party <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> an independent candidate. Conservative candidates in the ward won 45.8% of the vote, independent candidates won 27.0%, Labour Party candidates 17.6% and a Grey Party candidate 4.6%. The turnout was 34.5%.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}.

Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks and said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E

5|$|All of the {{children}} attended the nearby George Street State School <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> one the brothers joined the Fitzroy Cricket Club as they reached their early teens. The club had a program whereby they gave a medal for every local school to award to the best cricketer in their ranks in that year. The successful student would then be given access {{to all of the}} club's facilities. All of the Harvey brothers were recipients were of this medal. At Fitzroy, they came under the influence of former Victorian all-rounder Arthur Liddicut and the club's veteran captain Joe Plant. The Harveys had no formal coaching, and their father, although a regular presence at the club, chose to stay in the background as their respective careers developed. Horace did not advise his sons on how to bat, allowing them to formulate their own style and technique. According to the Harvey brothers, it was their mother who was vocal and extroverted, in contrast to their reserved father. The boys who failed to score runs were given kitchen duty and according to them, their parents never showed favouritism.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} {{purpose of the}} bombing campaign in Malaya was to kill as many insurgents as possible, the impracticality of achieving this in operations over dense jungle resulted in a shift towards harassing and demoralising the communists, driving {{them out of their}} bases and into areas held by Commonwealth ground troops. Operation Kingly Pile, which involved two sorties by No.1 Squadron <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> English Electric Canberra jet bombers of No.12 Squadron RAF on 21February 1956, was considered the most successful of the more than 4,000 missions conducted by the Lincolns, killing at least 14 communist troops. By the time it was withdrawn to Australia in July 1958, the squadron had dropped over 14,000 tonnes of bombs—85 per cent of the total delivered by Commonwealth forces during the Emergency. Its service was recognised with the presentation of a Squadron Standard by the Commander-in-Chief Far East Air Force, Air Marshal The Earl of Brandon. Until 2014, the Malayan Emergency had marked the last occasion that the unit took part in combat operations.|$|E
5|$|Another parodied film is the 1964 thriller Fail-Safe by Sidney Lumet: at the {{beginning}} of the third act of the episode, scenes of everyday life across Springfield are shown, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> one, with a 'zooming' sound effect, they all freeze-frame in anticipation of the (supposedly) imminent nuclear blast; such was the ending of Fail-Safe. One of the scenes before the supposed nuclear blast shows Maggie picking flowers in a field, with the camera zooming into her eye, and then the minuscule blast occurs. This is a parody of the infamous and controversial Daisy ad used by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election.|$|E
