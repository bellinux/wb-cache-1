5|$|Both species eat {{primarily}} squid. The whales make seasonal inshore {{and offshore}} movements {{in response to}} the dispersal of their prey. Fish that are consumed include Atlantic cod, Greenland turbot, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Atlantic herring, hake, and spiny dogfish in the northwest Atlantic. In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, but will also eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting. However, Faroe whales do not seem to feed on cod, herring, or mackerel even when they are abundant.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whales {{have also}} {{fallen victim to}} bycatches. In one year, around 30 short-finned pilot whales were caught by the squid round-haul fishery in {{southern}} California. Likewise, California's drift gill net fishery took around 20 whales {{a year in the}} mid-1990s. In 1988, 141 whales caught on the east coast of the U.S. were taken by the foreign <b>Atlantic</b> <b>mackerel</b> fishery, which forced it to be shut down.|$|E
5|$|Humpbacks feed {{primarily}} {{in summer and}} live off fat reserves during winter. They feed only rarely and opportunistically in their wintering waters. The humpback is an energetic hunter, taking krill and small schooling fish such as juvenile Atlantic and Pacific salmon, herring, capelin and American sand lance, as well as <b>Atlantic</b> <b>mackerel,</b> pollock and haddock in the North Atlantic. They have been documented opportunistically feeding near fish hatcheries in Southeast Alaska, feasting on salmon fry released from the hatcheries. Krill and copepods are prey species in Australian and Antarctic waters. Humpbacks hunt by direct attack or by stunning prey by hitting the water with pectoral fins or flukes.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to his administrative and supervisory responsibilities in Washington, Sette remained active in fisheries biology, particularly as it related to his interest in fluctuations in the abundance of fish stocks. As early as 1911, the Bureau of Fisheries had expressed interest in working {{as part of the}} International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) to determine the reasons for fluctuations in the annual catch of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>mackerel</b> in the Atlantic Ocean, but the United States had withdrawn from the ICES in 1916 after making little progress. Having himself noted highly variable annual <b>Atlantic</b> <b>mackerel</b> catches, Sette began an investigation of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>mackerel</b> on his own initiative. His former chemistry teacher Elmer Higgins, now also at the Bureau of Fisheres in Washington as Chief of the Division of Scientific Inquiry, noted his work on the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>mackerel</b> and offered him a position as a full-time fisheries investigator in his division, which Sette accepted in 1928.|$|E

Before his research ended abruptly in June 1932, when the aging ship became uneconomical to operate and was decommissioned, he concluded that mortality rates among <b>Atlantic</b> <b>mackerel</b> larvae changed from year to year according to variations in drift based on winds and not, as had earlier been proposed, based on changes in mortality at the critical period when larvae switched over from their yolks to exogenous food sources.

500|$|The {{etymology}} of {{the word}} [...] "porbeagle" [...] is obscure. A common suggestion is that it combines [...] "porpoise" [...] and [...] "beagle", referencing this shark's shape and tenacious hunting habits. Another {{is that it is}} derived from the Cornish porth, meaning [...] "harbor", and bugel, meaning [...] "shepherd". The Oxford English Dictionary states that the word was either borrowed from Cornish or formed from a Cornish first element with the English [...] "beagle"; however, none of the proposed Cornish root words is fully satisfactory. The Dictionary also notes that there is no evidence for a connection to the French porc, meaning [...] "swine", or to porpoise, as has been proposed. Other common names for the porbeagle include <b>Atlantic</b> <b>mackerel</b> shark, Beaumaris shark, bottle-nosed shark, and blue dog.|$|E

2500|$|Due to the {{geographic}} situation of Tenerife, the island enjoys {{an abundance of}} fish of various kinds.

The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>mackerel</b> (caballa), sardine (sardine), and Jack mackerels (chicharros) are also consumed frequently. Moray eels (morenas) are also eaten, usually fried.

40|$|Small pelagic fishes are {{particularly}} abundant {{in areas with}} high environmental variability (zones of coastal upwelling and areas of tidal mixing and river discharge), and because of this, their abundance suffers large inter-annual and inter-decadal fluctuations. In Portugal, the most important species in terms of landings are European sardine, <b>Atlantic</b> horse <b>mackerel</b> and <b>Atlantic</b> chub <b>mackerel.</b> Small pelagic fish landings account for 62. 8 % of the total fish biomass and represent 32. 7 % of the economical value of all catches. We have investigated trends in landings of these small pelagic fishes and detected the effects of environmental factors in this fishery. In order to explain the variability of landings of small pelagic fishes, we have used official landings (1965 - 2012) for trawling and purse seine fisheries and applied generalized linear models, using the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO) (annual and winter NAO index), sea surface temperature (SST), wind data (strength and North-South and East-West wind components) and rainfall, as explanatory variables. Regression {{analysis was used to}} describe the relationship between landings and SST. The models explained between 50. 16 and 51. 07 % of the variability of the LPUE, with the most important factors being winter NAO index, SST and wind strength. The LPUE of European sardine and <b>Atlantic</b> horse <b>mackerel</b> was negatively correlated with SST, and LPUE of <b>Atlantic</b> chub <b>mackerel</b> was positively correlated with SST.
