When he wakes, he hikes the last mile {{to the edge of}} the river where he sees the trout feeding in the evening light [...] "making circles all down the surface of the water as though it were {{starting}} to rain." [...] He pitches his tent, unpacks his supplies, cooks his dinner, fills his water bucket, heats <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> and kills a mosquito before falling asleep.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{scene that}} was in {{an earlier version of}} the script had young George visiting his father at his work. After George tells off Mr. Potter and closes the door, he {{considers}} asking Uncle Billy about his drugstore dilemma. Billy is talking on the phone to the bank examiner, and lights his cigar and throws his match in the wastebasket. This scene explains that Tilly (short for Matilda) and Eustace are both his cousins (not Billy's kids though), and Tilly is on the phone with her friend Martha and says, [...] "Potter's here, the bank examiner's coming. It's a day of judgment." [...] As George is about to interrupt Tilly on the phone, Billy cries for help and Tilly runs in and puts the fire out with <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> George decides he is probably better off dealing with the situation by himself.|$|E
60|$|The pan {{was over}} the fire getting hot. Blumpo cleaned the fish and put them on. In the meantime, Jerry made <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|E
60|$|My {{friend and}} his wife were {{finishing}} a poor meal--rags of old mutton, the remainder cakes from breakfast eaten cold, and <b>a</b> starveling <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|R
50|$|Jeremy Rowley as Paul Merkin - The Jr. Mail Room Engineer, and {{a common}} target of Terry's wrath for offenses such as forgetting to make <b>a</b> new <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> and farting in an elevator.|$|R
6000|$|Lee {{returned}} soon with <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> fresh <b>coffee</b> {{and some}} sandwiches, {{the sight of}} which roused young Gregg to impudent remark. [...] "Well, notice that! And we're left out!" [...] But Edwards shrank into the shadow, as if the light hurt him.|$|R
6000|$|Dominique came {{round to}} them, bearing {{appearance}} {{of one who}} has seen better days, and <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> brewed on a spirit lamp. Breakfast--he said--was served! ...|$|E
60|$|Of the lads, it was Randy who was {{the first}} to arise in the morning. He found Uncle Barney in the act of {{stirring}} up the fire. The old lumberman had already brought in some ice to be melted for <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Not if {{the court}} knows itself do I let a lady stake my horse for me," [...] said he. [...] "But if you'll run in, /chica/, and throw <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> {{together}} while I attend to the /caballo/, I'll be a good deal obliged." ...|$|E
60|$|The boys {{told the}} story of the trouble up the stream, and then related how they had shot the cougar, and {{exhibited}} the body of the slain beast. In the meantime they broiled some more fish, and made <b>an</b> extra <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> and some flapjacks for the newcomer.|$|R
60|$|At noon {{they stopped}} {{in a small}} hollow, {{sheltered}} from the wind, and made themselves <b>a</b> hot <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> and ate <b>a</b> frugal lunch. Tom sat up {{for a few minutes}} and the others were glad to see that the journey had done him no harm, either physically or mentally.|$|R
60|$|Wood was {{piled on}} the fire, and soon <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> {{steaming}} <b>coffee</b> made all feel better. When {{the man in}} charge went out to look at the sheep in the various folds Dave went with him. The air was filled with snow, and it was very dark.|$|R
6000|$|... "Breakfast," [...] said Rupert, firmly. [...] "If {{you don't}} {{know what it}} is, I can teach you in half a minute. You play it with <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> a knife and fork, and about a hundred-weight of {{scrambled}} eggs. Try it. It's a pastime that grows on you." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{now seen}} that both sailors were almost exhausted, and Captain Blossom {{allowed them to}} rest, while Dick {{prepared}} <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> While they were drinking, Gibson told them the particulars of how the mate had made himself leader of the sailors now left on the wreck.|$|E
60|$|They skated to the {{opposite}} shore and stopped near the shelter of some pines and hemlocks. All were willing to rest, and a small campfire was built, over which they made <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> They had brought with them some sandwiches and some cake, and these made up the brief noonday meal.|$|E
6000|$|Whopper had {{not been}} idle, and he soon had <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> hot <b>coffee,</b> to which they added some {{condensed}} milk and water-soaked sugar. They also got some fish from the lake, and the entire morning was devoted to [...] "drying out" [...] and getting a substantial meal.|$|R
60|$|Under the old hunter's {{directions}} {{they went}} to work, and by seven o'clock had the shelter cleaned out. This gave {{them a chance to}} get at their stores and also use the fireplace once more, and they cooked a fish breakfast and made <b>a</b> generous <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> and another <b>of</b> chocolate.|$|R
60|$|A long night's {{sleep and}} <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> delicious <b>coffee</b> for breakfast {{put so much}} {{sunshine}} into my world that I set out for Franklin Square with a gambler's countenance, resolute to conceal my dismay from my friends and especially from my publisher. There {{was something in the}} very air of Broadway which generated confidence.|$|R
60|$|The {{afternoon}} wore away slowly {{until the}} sun began to set behind the timber west of the ranch. In the meantime, the boys, having had no dinner, grew hungry, and Ralph spent some time below in boiling <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> and stirring and baking some ash-cakes, serving both {{with a bit of}} broiled steak.|$|E
60|$|Harz set <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> on a spirit-lamp, and cut himself some bread. Through {{the window}} the {{freshness}} of the morning came; the scent of sap and blossom and young leaves; the scent of earth, and the mountains freed from winter; the new flights and songs of birds; all the odorous, enchanted, restless Spring.|$|E
6000|$|That noon, up {{in their}} cabin, Shorty placed on the table a pot of beans, <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> a pan of sourdough biscuits, a tin of butter and a tin of {{condensed}} cream, a smoking platter of moose-meat and bacon, a plate of stewed dried peaches, and called: [...] "Grub's ready. Take a slant at Sally first." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bill was pasting court-plaster {{over the}} {{scratches}} and bruises on his features. There {{was a fire}} burning behind the big rock {{at the entrance of}} the cave, and the boy was watching <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> boiling <b>coffee,</b> with two buzzard tail-feathers stuck in his red hair. He points a stick at me when I come up, and says: ...|$|R
60|$|The new fall of {{snow had}} made {{traveling}} very heavy, and by noon they had covered only nine miles. Not a hut was in sight, {{and they made}} a temporary camp {{at the edge of}} a pine forest, where the trees sheltered them from the wind. A fire was built and they broiled a piece of mutton and made <b>a</b> large <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|R
50|$|A man {{finds himself}} {{alone on a}} dirt road, walking towards a diner. Inside he finds a jukebox playing loudly, and <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> hot <b>coffee</b> on the stove, {{but there are no}} other people. He {{inquires}} for some breakfast, but no chef or waitress is to be found. He is dressed in an Air Force flight suit, but he does not remember who he is or how he got there.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the little party had reached the ranch house. They went inside, {{and despite the fact}} that the boys were {{impatient}} to hear what Noel Urner might have to say, they gave the young man time to wash up and make himself otherwise presentable, Chet in the meanwhile frying another fish and preparing <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{was one in}} the {{afternoon}} when they started to climb. At eight that evening they cleared the rim and {{for half an hour}} lay where they had fallen. Then came the fire, <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> and an enormous feed of moosemeat. But first Linday hefted the two packs, and found his own lighter by half.|$|E
60|$|At noon they halted {{near the}} top of a second hill, and here started up just enough of a fire to boil {{themselves}} <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> They had brought jerked meat and crackers from home and made a comfortable, if not luxurious meal. In twenty minutes they were again on the way, the horses in the meantime having also been fed.|$|E
60|$|All three {{attempted}} to spring to their feet, Glutts knocking over <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> hot <b>coffee</b> {{as he did}} so. But the movement came too late, for the next instant the six snowballs bowled over the three boys, hurling them in all directions. One ball rolled through the lunch, carrying most of this along, imbedded in the snow. Another snowball went directly through the campfire, smashing that flat and leaving the embers hissing and blackened.|$|R
50|$|After {{the wife}} of a Johnson Wax {{executive}} heard the program, the Jordans, and Quinn, moved to their more memorable radio series Fibber McGee and Molly. Quinn was famous for delaying the actual writing of the scripts. Many from the show remember that he would wait until the last minute then lock himself in his office with a big plate <b>of</b> sandwiches, <b>a</b> huge <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> and two cartons of cigarettes. And hours later, he would emerge with a fresh script rarely in need of revision.|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm tired {{enough to}} drop right {{down and go}} to sleep in the snow, but my little tummy won't let me," [...] confessed Hal. [...] "Ring for the waiter, please, and have him bring me a planked steak with half a chicken on the side, {{grapefruit}} salad, and <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> with real cream. Wake me up when it comes." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{the girls}} arose {{they found the}} boys and Captain Jerry already {{preparing}} breakfast. On the shore Tom, had found some oysters and shell-fish, and these were baking. Among the provisions were a little tea and coffee, and old Jerry had made <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> which did one good to smell. Sam had brought down some cocoanuts from a nearby tree, and also found some ripe bananas.|$|E
60|$|With {{security}} {{from the}} storm, {{at least for}} the time being, everybody found himself hungry. A small fire of fir branches was started, and over this they made <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> and broiled a piece of the mutton brought along. They had some bread with them, and also some cheese-cake, and managed to make a square meal. They took their time eating, since there was nothing else to do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dinner is ready!" [...] called Fred at last, and {{one after}} another took a seat and ate the canned corn, tomatoes, and salmon which had been made ready. They also had a few {{crackers}} and <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> rather weak <b>coffee,</b> but they were sincerely thankful that matters were not worse.|$|R
60|$|Dinner was noiselessly and {{perfectly}} {{served by the}} butler who had first appeared, and a slighter and smaller edition of himself who brought him the dishes. There was no champagne, but other wines were served in their due order, the quality of which Arnold appreciated, although more than one was strange to him. With {{the removal of the}} last course, fruit was placed upon the table, with a decanter of Chateau Yquem. On a small table near was <b>a</b> brass <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> and <b>a</b> flask of green liqueur. Sabatini pushed the cigarettes towards his companion.|$|R
60|$|Soon a {{fire was}} blazing merrily. They built {{it under the}} outer {{end of a long}} tree limb, and from the limb {{suspended}} <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> full <b>of</b> water by a long iron chain they had brought along. As the ground was covered with snow, there was little danger of spreading a conflagration. Soon the water was boiling and the guide made <b>a</b> steaming <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> which was passed around in tin cups, with sugar and a little condensed milk. They had brought along bread, cheese, chipped beef, and boiled eggs, and also a mince pie which Mrs. Barrow had baked the day before, and these made what Tom declared was a famous dinner.|$|R
