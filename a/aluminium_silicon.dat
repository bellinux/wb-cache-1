25|$|Crystalline bulk silicon {{is rather}} inert, but becomes more {{reactive}} at high temperatures. Like its neighbour <b>aluminium,</b> <b>silicon</b> forms a thin, continuous surface layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) {{that protects the}} metal from oxidation. Thus silicon does not measurably react with the air below 900nbsp&°C, but formation of the vitreous dioxide rapidly increases between 950nbsp&°C and 1160nbsp&°C and when 1400nbsp&°C is reached, atmospheric nitrogen also reacts to give the nitrides SiN and Si3N4. Silicon reacts with gaseous sulfur at 600nbsp&°C and gaseous phosphorus at 1000nbsp&°C. This oxide layer nevertheless does not prevent reaction with the halogens; fluorine attacks silicon vigorously at room temperature, chlorine does so at about 300nbsp&°C, and bromine and iodine at about 500nbsp&°C. Silicon does not react with most aqueous acids, but is oxidised and fluorinated by a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid; it readily dissolves in hot aqueous alkali to form silicates. At high temperatures, silicon also reacts with alkyl halides; this reaction can be catalysed by copper to directly synthesise organosilicon chlorides as precursors to silicone polymers. Upon melting, silicon becomes extremely reactive in the liquid state, alloying with most metals to form silicides, and reducing most metal oxides because the heat of formation of silicon dioxide is so large. As a result, containers for liquid silicon must be made of refractory, unreactive materials such as zirconium dioxide or group 4, 5, and 6 borides.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this work, Al/SiO 2 {{composite}} coatings were {{deposited on}} the surface of aluminum alloy through atmospheric plasma spray. The effects of SiO 2 volume in Al/SiO 2 composite powders on the deposition behavior were investigated. It was found that the deposition of the Al/SiO 2 composite powder became more difficult through plasma spray with the increasing of SiO 2 contents. There were reactions between <b>aluminium</b> and <b>silicon</b> dioxide during the deposition of Al/SiO 2 powders in the plasma flame. The reactions were helpful to interface cohesions between <b>aluminium</b> and <b>silicon</b> dioxide.

Evaluating solubility data from a system containing Na', CI-, and OFf ions as well as <b>aluminium</b> and <b>silicon</b> compounds, allowed to elucidate the characteristics of the aluminosilicate scaling process, especially with regards to the influence of the <b>aluminium</b> and <b>silicon</b> distribution in solution. A chemical model was developed to describe the equilibrium of sodalite and hydroxysodalite over a range of conditions encountered in industrial liquors (OH- molality and ionic strength from 1 to 4). Pitzer's activity coefficient equations were successfully fitted to describe the apparent solubility product (i. e., [Al] [Si], in molalities) over the whole range of experimental data.

50|$|Considering that bicchulite {{was found}} in skarns, the mineral {{contains}} various impurities, thus preventing theformation of an absolute chemical formula. Even {{with the use of}} X-ray powder diffraction techniques, an accurate composition of bicchulite could not be determined. However, after performing some experiments of hydrating gehlenite, not only was bicchulite created but also an ideal chemical formula for the rare mineral was arranged as 2CaO •Al2O3 •SiO2 •H2O. Since bicchulite contains <b>aluminium,</b> <b>silicon,</b> and oxygen it is considered an aluminosilicate. At room temperature aluminosilicates typically have a ratio of aluminium to silicon that is close to 1 as a result of alternating linkages of Al and Si ions with O, or Loewenstein’s rule. Though bicchulite is an aluminosilicate, it is the only one to have an Al to Si ratio of 2:1 and have a framework structure. Bicchulite is also a sodalite-type mineral not only because of its similar composition components of Na6(Na,Ca)2(Al6Si6O24)X1−2n•H2O, but also because of its analogous structure.|$|E
50|$|Halloysite is an {{aluminosilicate}} {{clay mineral}} with the empirical formula Al2Si2O5(OH)4. Its main constituents are <b>aluminium</b> (20.90%), <b>silicon</b> (21.76%) and hydrogen (1.56%). Halloysite typically forms by hydrothermal alteration of alumino-silicate minerals. It can occur intermixed with dickite, kaolinite, montmorillonite and other clay minerals.
