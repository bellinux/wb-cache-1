500|$|Writing in Variety, {{the sister}} of Parker's alleged victim {{discussed}} the immense pain that Parker's The Birth of a Nation brought to her and her family, [...] "As her sister, the thing that pains me most of all is that in retelling {{the story of the}} Nat Turner slave revolt, they invented a rape scene. The rape of Turner’s wife is used as a reason to justify Turner’s rebellion. [...] This is fiction. I find it creepy and perverse that Parker and Celestin would put a fictional rape at the center of their film, and that Parker would portray himself as a hero avenging that rape. [...] Given what happened to my sister, and how no one was held accountable for it, I find this invention self-serving and sinister, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> as a cruel insult to my sister’s memory." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{an instant}} I was {{as full of}} {{resource}} as ever. There was but one course for a gentleman, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|There {{was only}} one chance, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> hurled myself across the dyke, and {{escaping}} out of the very clutches of my foes threw myself into the stream.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Austen, dispassionately. He {{had hardly}} heard what Zeb had said; his mind {{had been going}} onward. [...] "Yes. They sent me an annual pass, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{some truth}} in your remark <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> as a compliment, but my arrival's easily explained. I saw your {{fire in the}} {{distance}} and curiosity brought me along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are glad}} {{to have you with us}} on any terms, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> as {{particularly}} kind, that you did not pass my door. You have been here some days?" ...|$|E
6000|$|PAUL. But I am all {{attention}} and sympathy, my dear Dolphin. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> a little hardly {{that you should}} regard me as a stranger. (He lays a hand on Dolphin's shoulder.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{got a new}} manager. Watch him pitch now!" [...] That {{was what}} Nan Brown said to me about Rube Hurtle, my great pitcher, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> as her way of announcing her engagement.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We sent a great {{piece of}} our wedding-cake to the Whites,' put in Valetta. 'Fergus <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> on Saturday afternoon, but nobody {{was at home}} but Mrs. White, and she is fatter than ever.' ...|$|R
6000|$|This is no work of mine. My friend, Gabral Misquitta, the half-caste, spoke it all, between moonset and morning, {{six weeks}} before he died; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> down from his mouth as he {{answered}} my questions so:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} {{something}} like fifty, and may say I counted that many. They were chiefs, however, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> for granted, a goodly number of common warriors are not far off. Am I right, Pigeonswing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That settles it, my dears," [...] said Uncle John, cheerfully, {{when the}} soldier and the {{concierge}} had withdrawn. [...] "This Italian friend doesn't do things by halves, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> we are perfectly safe {{from this time}} on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know that, my lord, and I like {{a republican}} {{as little as}} you can do, or His Majesty himself, for that matter; <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> he has as little relish for the animal as flesh and blood can give." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Alam {{played a}} hitwoman {{in the movie}} Cash and Curry. In an {{interview}} {{she said of the}} role: “It was a role that presented itself to me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> on as one of life’s experiences”.|$|R
6000|$|... "'He handed <b>it</b> over, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> to the lamplight. The {{handwriting}} seemed {{unfamiliar to}} me; but when I {{glanced at the}} last page, I {{saw that it was}} signed [...] "Irene." [...] I read it through hastily.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps I {{was in a}} {{condition}} to receive the romantic impression he made upon me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> upon myself to ask his company as guide, and he cheerfully assented. But some domestic duty called him presently away.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is, indeed; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> {{to be the}} news, or {{connected}} with the news, that you have sent to the First Lord, in the late despatches. It has not taken you altogether by surprise, if the truth were said?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Speak not of it, {{think not}} of it," [...] said the eunuch. [...] "Say only that {{you leave it}} in my hands. Nay, then, if you cannot say it, do but nod your head, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> as your signal." ...|$|E
60|$|The persons principally {{concerned}} in the Event are:--a blind girl; two (twin) brothers; {{a skilled}} surgeon; and a curious foreign woman. I am the curious foreign woman. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> on myself--for reasons which will presently appear--to tell the story.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Finest {{piano in}} San Antone,' says Uncle Cal, waving his hand, proud. 'Genuine rosewood, and the finest, loudest tone you ever listened to. I heard the {{storekeeper}} play <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> {{on the spot}} and paid cash down.' ...|$|R
60|$|I dined at {{the club}} and looked in at a show afterward, and it wasn't till fairly late that I {{got back to the}} flat. There were no signs of Motty, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> that he had gone to bed.|$|R
60|$|I {{was going}} out when I saw a great big, fat, interesting-looking book lying there, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> up. It was {{an account of the}} {{invasion}} of England in the fourteenth century by the Preaching Friar, and it interested me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, go ahead," [...] I says. [...] "I'm sorry, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> all back. I didn't mean nothing. Fix it any way {{you want}} it. HE ain't any {{consequence}} to me. If he's killed, I'm as glad of it as you are; and if he--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear!" [...] he cried, {{glancing over}} his shoulder; [...] "my dear, {{here is our}} guest! Welcome, welcome to Greylands! I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Cousin Marshall, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> as a great {{compliment}} that you should honour this sleepy little country place with your presence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 1. This veil was one partition, betwixt {{the holy}} and most holy place; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> {{it was to}} keep from {{the sight of the}} worshippers the things most holy, when the high-priest went in thither, to {{accomplish}} the service of God (Exo 26:33; 2 Chron 3:14; Heb 9:8).|$|E
60|$|As I said, <b>I</b> looked around, <b>and</b> {{behind me}} found a heavy spade the {{gardener}} had {{at one time}} or another used for digging post holes. It was a strong and sharp implement, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> up with a good deal of satisfaction.|$|R
6000|$|... "He pressed me very hard," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "and I am afraid I made some admissions--well, there were necessary--which, {{to say the}} least of it, were compromising. There was only one way out of it decently for me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it.</b> You don't mind?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "’That’s my bisness,’ ses Bob Pretty, staring ’em {{full in the}} face. ’I just ’ad a {{excellent}} oppertunity {{offered me}} of going into the pork and poultry line <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it.</b> Now, all them as doesn’t want to buy any pork or fowls go out o’ my house.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{must you}} tell me? Your coming 'near' doesn't concern me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> you don't suppose I'm {{watching}} or sounding you. Mrs. Brook will have come terribly near," [...] Vanderbank continued {{as if to}} make the matter free; [...] "but she won't have done it either. She'll have been distinctly tempted--!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I quit,' he said pleasantly. 'The {{episode is}} closed. I {{am a man}} of peace, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> {{that you would not}} keep on lying quietly on that bed while I went into the other room and {{abstracted}} our young friend? Unless you have changed your mind again, would a fifty-fifty offer tempt you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And he's got a {{voice like}} a bird--you wouldn't think," [...] Dolly went on; [...] "he can sing a Christmas carril as his father's taught him; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> for a token as he'll come to good, as he can learn the good tunes so quick. Come, Aaron, stan' up and sing the carril to Master Marner, come." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{footsteps}} {{to and fro}} grew fewer. She {{moved to}} rise. Stirred by an impulse, I stretched out my hand, then seeing the flush upon her face, drew it back hastily. But the next moment, changing her mind, she held hers out to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it.</b> It was the first clasp of a hand I had felt since six months before I had said good-bye to Hal. She turned and walked quickly away. I stood watching her; she never looked round, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never saw her again.|$|R
60|$|There was but {{a single}} forlorn hope, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it.</b> Filling my lungs with air, I dived beneath the surface and swam through the inky, icy {{blackness}} on and on along the submerged gallery. Time <b>and</b> time again <b>I</b> rose with upstretched hand, only to feel the disappointing rocks close above me.|$|R
60|$|And then he {{took his}} load from me and dashed down the gang-plank. I went below to look for Pomona. The lantern still hung on the nail, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> down <b>and</b> went into the kitchen. There was Pomona, dressed, and with her hat on, quietly packing some things in a basket.|$|R
