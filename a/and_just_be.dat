5|$|Just Be Free is a demo album {{released}} by Warlock Records featuring music recorded by American recording artist Christina Aguilera. After finishing her run on The New Mickey Mouse Club, a then fifteen-year-old Aguilera began recording the album with New Jersey-based producers Roberts Alleca and Michael Brown. The pair gave Aguilera {{the opportunity to}} use a recording studio and presented her with demo music {{with the understanding that}} they could use the material for their own purpose, but also claiming they would not commercially release the recordings. Musically, the album consisted of dance style tracks as well as ballads, and saw Aguilera performing in Spanish language songs. The record was conceived to showcase Aguilera's vocals in an effort to reach out to record labels, a venture which actually backfired after the recordings were not very well received among critics. Six years after the completion of the album and Aguilera had achieved mainstream success, Brown and Allecca released the record <b>and</b> <b>Just</b> <b>Be</b> Free has sold over 128,000 copies in the United States.|$|E

Because I {{would be ready to}} go onstage <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> crying hysterically not understanding even how I was feeling. I was feeling very dizzy, I had a lot of vertigo, I had pain but it's like fuck if I know what hurts the most because I'd been on tour for a year. But I didn't want to let them down and I just couldn't cancel because the thought of leaving 50,000 kids in the arena just broke my heart. So I went out every night and I played and I played and I played until I couldn't walk one night." ...|$|E

So I've always understood that there's good and there's bad and you have to take them together <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> thankful for it all." ...|$|E

I had to really switch this button [...] like don't listen to it and feel what you’'re feeling.

500|$|Despite his folkloric qualities, the Slender Man {{is not in}} {{the public}} domain. Several for-profit ventures {{involving}} the Slender Man have unequivocally acknowledged Knudsen as the creator of this fictional character, while others were civilly blocked from distribution (including the Kickstarter-funded film) after legal complaints from Knudsen and other sources. Though Knudsen himself has given his personal blessing to a number of Slender Man-related projects, the issue is complicated by the fact that, while he is the character's creator, a third party holds the options to any adaptations into other media, including film and television. The identity of this option holder has not been made public. Knudsen himself has argued that his enforcement of copyright {{has less to do with}} money than with artistic integrity: [...] "I just want something amazing to come off it... something that's scary and disturbing and kinda different. I would hate for something to come out <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> kinda conventional." [...] As of May 2016, the media rights to Slender Man have been sold to production company Mythology Entertainment.|$|E

After Singer's statement, Dickinson reappeared on a subsequent broadcast of Entertainment Tonight to reassert her account from her prior interview on the program. In addition, she publicized photographs she took with a Polaroid camera of Cosby wearing a checkered bathrobe {{in order to support}} her assertions. In the interview with Kevin Frazier she stated her account was the truth: [...] "It is not a lie. It is my right as a woman. I have to speak up {{and you have to be}} able to go in <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> brave and do it for all the women that can't come forward." [...] She explained her motivation for going public and her desire for her voice to be heard: [...] "The loss of innocence that I suffered and that these women suffered is why I'm sitting here today. And I don't care about what Cosby or networks or anybody says, you will hear me." ...|$|E

500|$|After Underwood's Play On Tour {{ended in}} December 2010, {{she started to}} work on her then-untitled fourth studio album. Sony Music Nashville chairman/CEO Gary Overton said that the singer [...] "took nearly a year to compile and record the songs." [...] Songwriters Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who {{previously}} wrote [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] for Underwood's debut album, Some Hearts, worked on a track titled [...] "Blown Away" [...] {{and sent it to}} the singer. Underwood loved the song and recorded it, also naming her album Blown Away as it was the song that defined the album's darker direction. She then started writing material with several songwriters, including Hillary Lindsey and Kear. Together, the trio wrote [...] "Two Black Cadillacs", which is about two women finding out that they both are involved in a relationship with the same man and set their differences aside to kill him. Underwood said that [...] "it was so much fun to write <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> in that room" [...] with Lindsey and Kear, as they [...] "didn't really know what to expect or where we were headed or what we would end up with." [...] Kear described the writing session: ...|$|E
500|$|You {{know how}} many verses I did for that song. I did a version of that before her album [...] even came out. I did two verses. I love these verses too, but they ended up going with André's verse and André killed it. [...] Then [...] reached out to me and {{she wanted me to}} get on the remix. I did two more verses. Out of the second set that I did, she picked the first verse. But my second verse, I just gotta say for the record… It was just too long, I think she was looking for {{something}} shorter and more to the point. [...] It's just a blessing to even be able to work with [...] I'm on my defensive rapper, like yo man. When you follow in André's 3000's shoes, you're expected to really go in. Just the fact to even be on the song with her and shoot the video with her <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> in her presence. She's such a hard working, incredible artist. I’ll never forget that day we shot the video, I'll never forget being able to be on that song, and hopefully we got more as time goes on[...]|$|E
500|$|Although the Daddies were {{experiencing}} commercial success {{under the guise}} of swing revivalists, having been declared the [...] "leaders" [...] of the movement by Rolling Stone, the band openly contested being labeled a retro act at the exclusion of their dominant ska and punk influences and modernist lyricism. While still vocal supporters of both the swing revival and its bands, the Daddies adamantly tried to disassociate themselves from the swing scene and in particular its nostalgia-based mentality. Perry explained to Spin in July 1998, [...] "it's not our mission to be a swing band. I'm not a guy from the '40s. That's why we play ska and use heavy guitars", noting elsewhere [...] "I can't fully take us out of the retro classification, but we harp on the fact that we're contemporary music". Thusly, the Daddies avoided touring with swing bands, selecting Latin rock group Ozomatli and ska/soul band The Pietasters as support on their first headlining U.S. tour, and opening for Argentine rock band Los Fabulosos Cadillacs on their 1998 North American tour. At one point, the Daddies attempted to arrange a tour with Primus which never materialized; said Perry, [...] "I know there are people who come to our shows who'd like nothing more than for us to play swing 24/7...there are plenty of bands who want to be swing bands and swing bands only. We're trying to find the audience who'll let us write songs <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> who we are".|$|E

500|$|... "742617000027" [...] is the intro {{track to}} the album. It {{contains}} some guitar scratches and abstract sound {{samples from the}} sampler Craig Jones. Some of the dialogue was reportedly taken from a Charles Manson documentary. The dialogue is [...] "The whole thing, I think it's sick." [...] In an interview shortly after the album was released, Joey Jordison claimed the voice is Corey Taylor's, sped up. 742617000027 was the barcode number on their 1996 self-released album Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. All of the band members wear that number on their jumpsuits. [...] "Wait and Bleed" [...] is {{about a man who}} keeps having repetitive black and white dreams about laying in a bathtub full of his own blood with his wrists slit. One day, he wakes up and sees that his dream has become a reality. However, he doesn't want to believe it and he tries to fall back asleep again. Chris Fehn said that [...] "Surfacing" [...] "basically encompasses everything. Kind of encompasses the attitude of the band and the attitude of how we feel about life: Don't judge me. Everything that you think that you know about the world, and about Slipknot, and about your own life, might not be the case. So I think it's just openmindedness <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> cool." [...] Paul Gray said about the meaning behind [...] "Surfacing" [...] chorus: [...] "Basically, we dedicate it to the kids as their new national anthem. It's our way of saying don't worry about everybody else. Just worry about yourself. Don't worry about the people judging and the people coming down on you and all the fake crap. Stick to what you believe in." [...] "Spit It Out" [...] was written in response to some individuals who worked at a local radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, where Slipknot is from. These individuals worked hard to keep Slipknot off the air. [...] "Prosthetics" [...] was inspired by the 1965 film The Collector, which is about a butterfly collector who chose to collect humans, too.|$|E

[...] She also cited the Superstar, Nora Aunor as her inspiration, but she admitted she doesn't want to be compared with Aunor who originally showcased Domingo's latest theater role, Bona. She also cited the Philippines Star For All Season, Vilma Santos as one of her idols. She also parodied some of the famous dialogues and looks of Santos in various films such as D' Lucky Ones. Domingo also announced admiration for the Philippine actress, Maricel Soriano who is dubbed as [...] "The Diamond Star". She likes how she handled her career and all the issues being thrown at her and she was impressed by her class and elegance.|$|E

2500|$|One of the band's most {{striking}} aspects is B-Real's exaggeratedly high-pitched nasal vocals. In the book Check the Technique, B-Real describes his nasal style, saying his rapping voice is [...] "high and annoying... the nasal style I have {{was just something}} that I developed... my more natural style wasn't so pleasing to DJ Muggs and Sen Dog's ears" [...] {{and talking about the}} nasal style in the book How to Rap, B-Real says, [...] "you want to stand out from the others <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> distinct... when you got something that can separate you from everybody else, you gotta use it to your advantage." [...] In the film Art of Rap, B-Real credits the Beastie Boys as an influence when developing his rapping style. Sen Dog's voice is deeper, more violent and often shouted alongside the rapping; his vocals are often emphasized by adding another background/choir voice to say them. Sen Dog's style is in contrast to B-Real's, who says, [...] "Sen's voice is so strong," [...] and [...] "it all blends together" [...] when they are both on the same track.|$|E

[...] In June, she participated in VidCon's opening show, YouTube OnStage, in The Arena at Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California, where she premiered the first single from the upcoming album, [...] "Moonlight". She later released additional singles from the album. In July, she performed at the [...] Starkey Gala in St. Paul, Minnesota, to support hearing charities. In August, she returned [...] to AGT as a guest performer, singing [...] "Moonlight". The same month, Windex used VanderWaal's [...] "Beautiful Thing" [...] as the soundtrack to an advertisement, Honda used her cover of [...] "Over the Rainbow" [...] for a Japanese ad, and SheKnows Media ranked [...] "I Don't Know My Name" [...] as one of the 16 most empowering songs for women so far in 2017. In September, VanderWaal performed on Live with Kelly and Ryan. The same month, she appeared on Treehouse Masters in an episode about the tree houses that VanderWaal had planned since her appearance on AGT, and modeled at New York Fashion Week for Marc Jacobs. She also promoted the album with performances in September on Ellen and in October at the Austin City Limits Music Festival, where she was [...] "ne of the fest's biggest breakout acts ... whose soaring voice and sweet pop songs charmed large ... crowds." [...] She performed at more WE Day events in Vancouver, Canada, in October and St. Paul, Minnesota, in November.|$|E
