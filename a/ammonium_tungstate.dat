For this purpose, different techniques were used such as adsorption of N 2 at 77 K and mercury porosimetry; X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; temperatureprogrammed desorption of previously adsorbed NH 3; and behavior in the decomposition reactions of isopropanol. Results show {{that in the case}} of the catalysts prepared from <b>ammonium</b> <b>tungstate</b> an increase in the treatment temperature between 623 and 1223 K leads to a drop in the O/W ratio to below 3, resulting in the appearance of nonstoichiometric oxides such as W 25 O 73,W 20 O 58, and W 18 O 49. At 1223 K, a mixture of W, tungsten carbides, and tungsten trioxide was detected. The catalysts prepared from tungsten hexacarbonyl presented a higher dispersion and no X-ray diffraction peaks. Total surface acidity, as measured by ammonia desorption, decreased with increasing treatment temperature, and the study of the decomposition reactions of isopropanol showed that the catalysts were essentially of acid character, with a much higher selectivity (or rate) to propene than to acetone. Moreover, there was a linear relationship between the reaction rate to propene and the amount of NH 3 desorbed from the catalysts, irrespective the method of preparation and treatment temperature. c ○ 2000 Academic Press Key Words: tungsten catalysts; carbon support; total surface acidity...|$|E

Laser Raman spectra provided evidence for existence of(WO 6) (n-) groups constructing polytungstate ions in the acidified solution of <b>ammonium</b> <b>tungstate.</b> The H- 2 -TPR {{results showed that the}} reduction of precursor of the 3 % W-H 2 SO 4 /HZSM- 5 catalyst may occur at temperatures below 900 K, producing W species with mixed valence states, W 5 + and W 4 +, whereas the reduction of the 3 % W/HZSM- 5 occurred mainly at temperatures above 1023 K, producing only one type of dominant W species, W 5 +. The results seem to imply that the observed high DHAM activity on the W-H 2 SO 4 /HZSM- 5 catalyst was closely correlated with (WO 6) (n-) groups with octahedral coordination as the precursor of catalytically active species. Incorporation of Zn (or La) into the W-H 2 SO 4 /HZSM- 5 catalyst has been found to pronouncedly improve the activity and stability of the catalyst for DHAM reaction.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} influences of temperature on the conversion of <b>ammonium</b> <b>tungstate</b> pentahydrate (ATP) powder to tungsten trioxide (WO 3) particles with controllable sizes, crystallinities, and physicochemical properties. In this study, we used a simple thermal decomposition method. In the experimental procedure, we explored the effect of temperature on the physicochemical properties of ATP by testing various heating temperatures (from 100 to 900 °C). The heated ATP samples were then characterized by a physical observation (i. e. color) and various analysis methods (i. e. a thermal gravimetric and differential thermal analysis, infrared spectroscopy, an X-ray diffraction, and a scanning electron microscope). Experimental results showed that increases in temperature had an impact to the decreases in particle size, the change in material crystallinity, and the change in physical properties (e. g. change of color from white, orange, to yellowish green). The relationships between the reaction temperatures and the physicochemical properties of the ATP were also investigated in detail along with the theoretical consideration and the proposal of the WO 3 particle formation mechanism. In simplification, the phenomena can be described into three zones of temperatures. (1) Below 250 °C (release of water molecules and some ammonium ions).; (2) At 250 - 400 °C (release of water molecules and ammonium ions, restructurization of tungsten and oxygen elements, and formation of amorphous tungsten trioxide). (3) At higher than 400 °C (crystallization of tungsten trioxide). Since ATP possessed reactivity on temperature, its physicochemical properties changing could be observed easily, and the experimental procedure could be done easily.
