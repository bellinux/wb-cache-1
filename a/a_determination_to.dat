5|$|Benaud {{returned}} for the Third Test, when England levelled the series despite twin half-centuries of 73 and 53 from Harvey, who top-scored in both innings on a dustbowl in a match that lasted only three days. Harvey {{failed to pass}} 35 {{in the last two}} Tests, and ended with 338 runs at 42.25, and was a significant factor in Australia's eventual 2–1 victory. In {{the second half of the}} tour, Harvey added centuries against Nottinghamshire and Warwickshire and took his career best bowling fugres of 4/8 against Middlesex to help set up a ten-wicket win. He ended his final tour for Australia with 1452 runs at 44.00 with five centuries. During the season, Harvey and Benaud led aggressively to force a result through attacking strategy and <b>a</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> avoid time-wasting.|$|E
5|$|Although the Offaly revolt was {{followed}} by <b>a</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> rule Ireland more closely, Henry was wary of drawn-out conflict with the tribes, and a royal commission recommended that the only relationship with the tribes was to be promises of peace, their land protected from English expansion. The man to lead this effort was Sir Antony St Leger, as Lord Deputy of Ireland, who would remain into the post past Henry's death. Until the break with Rome, it was widely believed that Ireland was a Papal possession granted as a mere fiefdom to the English king, so in 1541 Henry asserted England's claim to the Kingdom of Ireland free from the Papal overlordship. This change did, however, also allow a policy of peaceful reconciliation and expansion: the Lords of Ireland would grant their lands to the King, before being returned as fiefdoms. The incentive to comply with Henry's request was an accompanying barony, and thus a right {{to sit in the}} Irish House of Lords, which was to run in parallel with England's. The Irish law of the tribes did not suit such an arrangement, because the chieftain did not have the required rights; this made progress tortuous, and the plan was abandoned in 1543, not to be replaced.|$|E

25|$|In Edinburgh, {{in early}} 1787, he met James Johnson, a {{struggling}} music engraver and music seller with {{a love of}} old Scots songs and <b>a</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> preserve them. Burns shared this interest and became an enthusiastic contributor to The Scots Musical Museum. The first volume was published in 1787 and included three songs by Burns. He contributed 40 songs to volume two, {{and he ended up}} responsible for {{about a third of the}} 600 songs in the whole collection, as well as making a considerable editorial contribution. The final volume was published in 1803.|$|E
25|$|The Consultation's {{main purpose}} was to decide the overall goals of the revolution.

25|$|The {{projected}} {{movement that}} was to decide the Battle of Ligny was preceded, at about 20:30, by the rapid advance of several batteries of the Imperial Guard, which opened-up a destructive fire upon the Prussians posted within, and formed in the immediate rear of, Ligny. Under cover of this cannonade, Girard, with the 12th Infantry Division (Pécheux's), reinforced the troops that still maintained {{that half of the}} village of Ligny which lay on the right bank of the Ligny, and pushed forward with <b>a</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> dislodge the Prussians from the remaining portion on the left bank.|$|E

The most important factors that drove Egyptian foreign policy in this period was on the one hand, <b>a</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> see the entire Middle East as Egypt's rightful sphere of influence, and on the other, a tendency on the part of Nasser to fortify his pan-Arabist and nationalist credibility by seeking to oppose any and all Western security initiatives in the Near East.|$|E
25|$|Chad's eschatological {{consciousness}} {{and its effect}} on others is brought to life in a reminiscence attributed to Trumbert, who was one of his students at Lastingham. Chad used to break off reading whenever a gale sprang up and call on God to have pity on humanity. If the storm intensified, he would shut his book altogether and prostrate himself in prayer. During prolonged storms or thunderstorms he would go into the church itself to pray and sing psalms until calm returned. His monks obviously regarded this as an extreme reaction even to English weather and asked him to explain. Chad explained that storms are sent by God to remind humans of the day of judgement and to humble their pride. The typically Celtic Christian involvement with nature was not like the modern romantic preoccupation but <b>a</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> read in it the mind of God, particularly in relation to the last things.|$|E
25|$|The character's {{difficult}} ethical history, and {{the character}} himself, were laid to rest by DC in its year-long weekly title, 52, in which Sage recruits and trains Gotham ex-cop Renee Montoya as his replacement before dying of lung cancer. In this incarnation he is wry, cheerful and avuncular, although still enigmatic. He displays no discernible philosophical commitments, aside from <b>a</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> recruit Montoya and to have her decide who she is and who she will become. Montoya is herself agonized {{over the issue of}} killing criminals, although her guilt is over a principled refusal to kill one, specifically the murderer of her former partner. The series' action chiefly alternates between Gotham City, where Montoya struggles to save Kate Kane from Intergang and its Crime Bible cult, and Nanda Parbat, where she trains with Sage's mentors Rodor and Dragon, and whence she later returns with Sage, too late to find him a cure for his cancer. En route there, Sage dies muttering snatches of conversations from his early comics appearances and a final invocation to Montoya to decide who she will become. After grieving, she determines to take up his mantle as the new Question.|$|E

500|$|In the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Barry Millington has {{described}} the 'Powerhouse' style as [...] "arresting images of dislocated reality, an inexhaustible repertory of stage contrivances, <b>a</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> explore the social and psychological issues latent in the works, and above all an abundant sense of theatricality." [...] As examples, Millington mentioned Rusalka (1983), with its Edwardian nursery setting and Freudian undertones, and Hansel and Gretel (1987), its dream pantomime peopled by fantasy figures from the children's imagination ... Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (1987) and Wozzeck (1990) exemplified an approach to production in which grotesque caricature jostles with forceful emotional engagement.|$|E
500|$|Both of the books' {{historical}} premises {{and practical}} prescriptions have been challenged. For example, according to Peter Berkowitz, {{the reason that}} [...] "he primarily democratic nature of the Constitution's governmental structure has not always seemed obvious", as Breyer puts it, is [...] "because it's not true, at least in Breyer's sense that the Constitution elevates active liberty above modern [...] liberty". [...] Breyer's position [...] "demonstrates not fidelity to the Constitution", Berkowitz argues, [...] "but rather <b>a</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> rewrite the Constitution's priorities". [...] Berkowitz suggests that Breyer is also inconsistent, in failing to apply this standard {{to the issue of}} abortion, instead preferring decisions [...] "that protect women's modern liberty, which remove controversial issues from democratic discourse". [...] Failing to answer the textualist charge that the Living Documentarian Judge is a law unto himself, Berkowitz argues that Active Liberty [...] "suggests that when necessary, instead of choosing the consequence that serves what he regards as the Constitution’s leading purpose, Breyer will determine the Constitution’s leading purpose {{on the basis of the}} consequence that he prefers to vindicate".|$|E
