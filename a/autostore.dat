50|$|Similar {{critical}} {{applications such}} as medical equipment and high end servers can use nvSRAMs to store their data. In case of external power failure, or unforeseen calamities, nvSRAM can hold the data without external intervention (<b>autostore</b> feature). Hence it would provide the flexibility of an EEPROM but at SRAM speeds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Autostore</b> happens {{automatically}} {{when the}} data main voltage source drops below the device's operating voltage. When this occurs, the power control is switched from Vcc to the capacitor. The capacitor will power the chip {{long enough to}} store the SRAM contents into the non-volatile part. The HSB (Hardware Store Busy) pin externally initiates a non-volatile hardware store operation. Using the HSB signal, which requests a non-volatile hardware STORE cycle, is optional. Software store is initiated by a certain sequence of operations. When the defined operations are done in sequence the software store is initiated.|$|E

40|$|The {{authors of}} this thesis have worked {{together}} with Hatteland and their partner Swisslog {{in order to help}} them to do a research on the brand <b>AutoStore.</b> The objective through this research was to answer the following problem definition; “What could prevent the Chinese market from adopting the <b>AutoStore</b> system?” To answer this, several questions were raised, both towards the market, the competitors and the product itself. The authors agreed on an explorative design as both the authors’ and Hatteland’s knowledge of the market was limited. With this situation as the fundament of the research, the authors began collecting secondary, and then primary data. The internal analysis identified several challenges for Hatteland in regard of entering China. The most important factors are localization of the production of <b>AutoStore,</b> organizational efficiency and the price of <b>AutoStore.</b> The external analysis identified several challenges including the Chinese culture and competitors. In the research, potential customers recognized space saving, which is the core competitive advantage of <b>AutoStore,</b> as the most important factor when investing in a new storage system. This indicates that <b>AutoStore</b> has a potential in the Chinese market. The authors have proposed a strategy which can enable Hatteland to introduce <b>AutoStore</b> to the Chinese market. The most important aspects of the strategy include a tighter cooperation with their partner, local production to reduce the price of <b>AutoStore,</b> setting up a test grid and adopting the price policy. Furthermore, it will be important to get the first customer {{in order to have a}} local reference. A pre-sale offer is suggested in order to attain the first customer...|$|E

Authors employ the idea of attribute affinity used {{in the works of}} 80 s and 90 s (e.g. [4, 5]) and “dynamize” it.

40|$|Abstract. Vertical and Horizontal {{partitions}} allow database adminis-trators (DBAs) to considerably {{improve the}} performance of business in-telligence applications. However, finding and defining suitable horizontal and vertical partitions is a daunting task even for experienced DBAs. This is because the DBA has to understand the physical query execution plans for each query in the workload very well to make appropriate de-sign decisions. To facilitate this process several algorithms and advisory tools have been developed over the past years. These tools, however, still keep the DBA in the loop. This means, the physical design cannot be changed without human intervention. This is problematic in situations where a skilled DBA is either not available or the workload changes over time, e. g. due to new DB applications, changed hardware, an increasing dataset size, or bursts in the query workload. In this paper, we present AutoStore: a self-tuning data store which rather than keeping the DBA in the loop, monitors the current workload and partitions the data au-tomatically at checkpoint time intervals — without human intervention. This allows <b>AutoStore</b> to gradually adapt the partitions to best fit the observed query workload. In contrast to previous work, we express partitioning as a One-Dimensional Partitioning Problem (1 DPP), with Horizontal (HPP) and Vertical Partitioning Problem (VPP) being just two variants of it. We provide an efficient O 2 P (One-dimensional Online Partitioning) algorithm to solve 1 DPP. O 2 P is faster than the specialized affinity-based VPP algorithm by more than two orders of magnitude, and yet it does not loose much on partitioning quality. <b>AutoStore</b> {{is a part of}} the OctopusDB vision of a One Size Fits All Database System [13]. Our experimental results on TPC-H datasets show that <b>AutoStore</b> outperforms row and column layouts by up to a factor of 2. Key words: changing workload, online partitioning, self-tunin...|$|E
