Methods We formed two reference groups and sought consumer <b>and</b> <b>community</b> representatives' perspectives on {{all aspects of the}} project over a three year period. We developed an evaluation framework and asked consumer <b>and</b> <b>community</b> representatives <b>and</b> researchers to complete a self-administered questionnaire {{at the end of the}} project. Results Fifteen researchers (93. 8 %) and seven (53. 8 %) consumer <b>and</b> <b>community</b> representatives completed a questionnaire. Most consumer <b>and</b> <b>community</b> representatives agreed that the process and context measures of their participation had been achieved. Both researchers <b>and</b> consumer <b>and</b> <b>community</b> representatives identified areas for improvement and offered suggestions how these could be improved for future research. Researchers thought consumer <b>and</b> <b>community</b> participation contributed to project outputs and outcomes by enhancing scientific and ethical standards, providing legitimacy and authority, and increasing the project's credibility and participation. They saw it was fundamental to the research process and acknowledged consumer <b>and</b> <b>community</b> representatives for their excellent contribution. Consumer <b>and</b> <b>community</b> representatives were able to directly influence decisions about the research. They thought that consumer <b>and</b> <b>community</b> participation had significant influence on the success of project outputs and outcomes. Conclusions Consumer <b>and</b> <b>community</b> participation is an essential component of good research practice and contributed to the Alcohol and Pregnancy Project by enhancing research processes, outputs and outcomes, and this participation was valued by <b>community</b> <b>and</b> consumer representatives and researchers. The National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia expects researchers to work in partnership and involve consumer <b>and</b> <b>community</b> representatives in health and medical research, <b>and</b> to evaluate <b>community</b> <b>and</b> consumer participation. It is important to demonstrate whether consumer <b>and</b> <b>community</b> participation makes a difference to health and medical research. </p...|$|R
