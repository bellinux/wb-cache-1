5|$|Archaeological finds {{from the}} Carpathian Basin provide {{evidence}} of the crafts practiced by the Magyars. 10th-century warriors' graves yielding sabres, arrow-heads, spear-heads, stirrups, and snaffle bits made of iron show that blacksmiths had a pre-eminent role in the militarized Magyar society. Engraved or gilded sabres and sabretache platesoften decorated with precious stonesand golden or silver pectoral disks evidence {{the high levels of}} skills of Magyar gold- and silversmiths. Cemeteries in the Carpathian Basin also yielded scraps of canvas made of flax or hemp. The positioning of metal buttons in the graves shows the Magyars wore clothes that either opened down the front or were fastened <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck.</b> Ear-rings were the only accessories worn above the belt by Magyar warriors; jewelry on their upper bodies would have hindered them from firing arrows.

40|$|SummaryThe GTPase dynamin assembles <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>necks</b> of budded vesicles in vivo and {{functions}} in membrane fission. We have developed fluid supported bilayers with excess membrane reservoir, (SUPER) templates, to assay vesicle formation and membrane fission. Consistent with previous studies, {{in the absence}} of GTP, dynamin assembles in spirals, forming long membrane tubules. GTP addition triggers disassembly, but not membrane fission, arguing against models in which fission is mediated by concerted and global GTP-driven conformational changes. In contrast, under physiological conditions in the constant presence of GTP, dynamin mediates membrane fission. Under these conditions, fluorescently labeled dynamin cooperatively organizes into self-limited assemblies that continuously cycle <b>at</b> <b>the</b> membrane and drive vesicle release. When visualized <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>necks</b> of emergent vesicles, self-limited dynamin assemblies display intensity fluctuations and persist for variable time periods before fission. Thus, self-limited assemblies of dynamin generated in the constant presence of GTP catalyze membrane fission...|$|R

Joyce is chained <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Dagen's progress. After he escapes the cage, which dangles over a floor of spikes, he begins searching for Joyce.

They represent the three wise monkeys and are killed despite Dagen's efforts to save them. After removing his upper wisdom teeth to obtain the combination for a security door, Dagen finds Joyce and is forced to reenact the trap {{he claimed to have}} survived: he must drive hooks through his pectoral muscles and hoist himself up to the ceiling to deactivate her trap. He fails nonetheless, and is forced to watch as a brazen bull capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her to death.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a No Surrender Dog Collar {{match for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Raven and the {{challenger}} Abyss, who was accompanied by James Mitchell. The encounter lasted 19 minutes and 17 seconds. In a Dog Collar match, both competitors are tied together <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> by a long steel chain that {{is attached to a}} dog collar. The match is fought under no disqualification rules; in this case the only way to win was by pinfall. Abyss crashed through a table at ringside after Raven pushed him off the stage. Abyss removed the collar during the match and retrieved a bag of thumbtacks. He then poured them over the mat and ripped Raven's shirt off, before attempting to slam him into them. Cassidy Reilly interfered in the contest stopping Abyss. Later, Cassidy was shoved off the ring apron by Abyss and he crashed through a table. Raven followed by slamming Abyss back-first into the tacks with a powerbomb and covered for a near-fall. Abyss also gained a near-fall on Raven after slamming him into the mat back-first with his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver. Raven finally won the contest following forcing Abyss head-first into thumbtacks with his signature Raven Effect DDT maneuver to retain the championship. Following the bout, a segment took place between Raven and Jeff Jarrett, which ended when Rhino made his TNA debut and tackled Raven with his signature Gore maneuver.|$|E

40|$|We examine, with {{asymptotic}} {{analysis and}} numerical simulation, the iterated stretching dynamics of FENE and Oldroyd-B jets of initial radius r(sub 0), shear viscosity nu, Weissenberg number We, retardation number S, and capillary number Ca. The usual Rayleigh instability stretches the local uniaxial extensional flow region near a minimum in jet radius into a primary filament of radius [Ca(1 - S) / We](sup 1 / 2) r(sub 0) between two beads. The strain-rate within the filament remains constant while its radius (elastic stress) decreases (increases) exponentially {{in time with}} a long elastic relaxation time 3 We(r(sup 2, sub 0) /nu). Instabilities convected from the bead relieve <b>the</b> tension <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>necks</b> during this slow elastic drainage and trigger a filament recoil. Secondary filaments then form <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>necks</b> from <b>the</b> resulting stretching. This iterated stretching is predicted to occur successively to generate high-generation filaments of radius r(sub n), (r(sub n) /r(sub 0)) = square root of 2 [r(sub n- 1) /r(sub 0) ](sup 3 / 2) until finite-extensibility effects set in...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{initiation}} {{and growth}} of necks in polymer tubes subjected to rapidly increasing internal pressure is analyzed numerically. Plane strain conditions are assumed to prevail in the axial direction. The polymer {{is characterized by a}} finite strain elastic–viscoplastic constitutive relation and the calculations are carried out using a dynamic finite element program. Numerical results for neck development are illustrated and discussed for tubes of various thicknesses. The sensitivity to the wave number of the thickness imperfections is studied with a focus on comparing a long wave length imperfection and a short wave length imperfection. After some thinning down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>necks,</b> <b>the</b> mode of deformation switches to <b>neck</b> propagation along <b>the</b> circumference of the tube. A case is shown in which <b>the</b> <b>necks</b> have propagated along the entire tube wall, so that network locking in the polymer results in high stiffness against further expansion of the tube. The rate dependence of <b>the</b> <b>necking</b> behavior gives noticeable differences in neck development for slow loading versus fast loading...|$|R

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of complex}} fluids can be investigated by subjecting them to controlled rheometric flows such as extensional flow. A uniaxial extensional flow is generated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>necking</b> plane of liquid filaments due to surface tension. Simple stress balances {{are often used}} to model capillary thinning dynamics <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>necking</b> plane, and extract the extensional viscosity of the sample fluid. Previous modelling studies have focussed on liquids where either viscous or inertial effects are dominant. Experimental observations {{on the other hand}} are obtained where effects of viscosity and inertia are both important. The failure to account for both effects simultaneously can cause discrepancies in interpreting experimental data. Here a stress-balance that simultaneously incorporates both viscous and inertial effects is used to predict the evolution of the mid-plane radius as a function of time in capillary thinning experiments. The stress-balance is extended to include non-Newtonian stresses, and is used to study the dynamics of slender filaments of polymer solutions and suspensions of motile microbes. The results of modelling the non-Newtonian fluids are used with new micro-structure based constitutive models for non-Newtonian stresses in extensional flow...|$|R

However, in the fixation model, <b>the</b> implant <b>neck</b> and tip had substantially equivalent values and the stress generation range was also narrower {{than that of the}} contact model. This shows that under immediate loading conditions, there is a high likelihood that loading applied to the superstructure is also supported by cancellous bone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> implant threads and tip, but the majority is supported by cortical bone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> implant <b>neck.</b> That is, under immediate loading conditions, it is believed {{there is a need to}} be mindful of <b>the</b> stress concentration <b>at</b> <b>the</b> implant <b>neck.</b> <b>The</b> material properties of the FEA models constructed in the present study cannot not be compared to actual oral cavity stress values because they differ significantly from an actual bone. However, when regarding how peri-implant bone is impacted by contact between the implant and bone, it is considered sufficiently useful in predicting tendencies.|$|R
