40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is to {{critically}} evaluate the col-lective epidemiologic evidence that a history of breast-feeding may decrease {{the risk of breast}} cancer. Original data for inclusion were identified through a MEDLINE ® search of the English language literature from 1966 through 1998. To date, virtually all epidemiologic data regarding breast-feeding and breast cancer risk are derived from case–control studies, which vary according to classification of breast-feeding history. Overall, the evidence with respect to “ever” breast-feeding remains inconclusive, with results indicating either no association or a rather weak protective effect against breast cancer.

40|$|Visual {{tracking}} of multiple objects with continuous interactions {{is important for}} many applications such as surveillance and effective user interfaces. Complex interactions between objects results in both temporally and spatially significant occlusions, making multi-object tracking a challenging problem. We present an approach for tracking varying number of objects through significant occlusions. Our approach builds {{on the idea of}} object permanence [2]. That is, partially or fully occluded objects, even though not observable, still exist in the close proximity of their occluders. In an image, given a fixed background model, objects within close proximity reside in the same connected foreground area, or a region. Our approach to tracking relies on (<b>i)</b> <b>a</b> regionlevel <b>association</b> process and (ii) an object-level localization process to track objects through long periods of occlusions...|$|R

In these cases, impaired Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -specific CD 8 (+) T-cell immunity is strongly implicated and antigen presentation within the malignant B-cell is intact Interestingly, {{several studies have}} reported HLA class I alleles with protective or susceptibility associations. However, results are conflicting, likely influenced by methodology including inconsistent use of multiple hypothesis testing. By contrast, HLA class <b>I</b> <b>associations</b> have been repeatedly reported for classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL), in which EBV is also implicated in a proportion of cases. In contrast to EBV+ PTLD which expresses the immunodominant EBV latency III EBNA 3 A/B/C proteins, EBV+ cHL is restricted to the subdominant EBNAl/LMP 1 /LMP 2 proteins. Herein, we report a study of HLA class <b>I</b> <b>associations</b> in EBV+ PTLD, with 263 patients with lymphoma (cHL or PTLD) evaluated. Two Australian population cohorts, n = 23, 736 and n = 891 were used for comparison.

40|$|International audienceAmerican trypanosomiasis or Chagas {{disease is}} endemic in Latin America and {{caused by the}} {{flagellate}} Trypanosoma cruzi, which exhibits broad genetic variation. In various areas, the transmission of Chagas disease is ensured by sylvatic vectors, mainly carrying the evolutionary lineage I of T. cruzi. Despite its epidemiological importance, this lineage is poorly studied. Here, we investigated the genetic variability and the phylogenetic relationships within T. cruzi I using sequences of the non-transcribed spacer of miniexon genes. The variability was firstly analysed between 10 repeats of spacer-miniexon genes in two strains of T. cruzi I and in the CL Brener strain, showing lower intra-strain variability than inter-strain. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis of 19 T. cruzi I strains (49 copies in total) clusters the copies into at least three groups. Two evolutionary phenomena can be proposed to explain the partition of the strains: (<b>i)</b> <b>an</b> <b>association</b> between strains and Didelphis sp. hosts and (ii) geographical clustering between the North American and South American strains.

Molecular Plant Pathology, 6, (1), 65 - 78 Sponsorship: Marie Curie Individual Fellowship (E. P.); DEFRA (T. L. W. C.) Nonspecific penetration resistance due to papilla formation and race-specific hypersensitive response (HR) can both contribute to Blumeria graminis resistance in barley. Some effective papillae form {{even in the}} susceptible cv. Pallas and the isoline P 01 carries the additional Mla 1 allele conditioning HR. The NO-specific stain DAF- 2 DA (4, 5 -diaminofluorescein- 2 -diacetate) revealed a transient NO generation burst commencing 10 h after inoculation (h. <b>a.</b> <b>i.)</b> in close <b>association</b> with sites of papilla formation in both barley lines. In P 01 a burst of NO production throughout some attacked cells was initiated around 10 ? 12 h. <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> and this preceded whole-cell autofluorescence indicative of HR. The specificity of DAF- 2 DA staining was demonstrated by the suppression of staining following application of the NO scavenger C-PTIO (1 H-imidazol- 1 -yloxy- 2 -(4 -carboxyphenyl) - 4, 5 -dihydro- 4, 4, 5, 5 -tetramethyl- 3 -oxide). In addition, C-PTIO application increased penetration frequencies in both barley lines, indicating a role for NO in papilla-based resistance. Furthermore, C-PTIO application slightly delayed HR in P 01 whereas, conversely, application of an NO donor, sodium nitroprusside, slightly accelerated HR in P 01 and increased cell death frequency in Pallas. Thus, NO generation {{is one of the}} earliest responses of barley epidermal cell defence against B. graminis attack and may be important in both the initiation and the development of effective papillae and cell death due to HR.
