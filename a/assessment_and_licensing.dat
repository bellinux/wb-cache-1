40|$|Species of {{conservation}} concern, or those {{in conflict with}} man, are most effi-ciently managed {{with an understanding of}} their population dynamics. European bats exemplify the need for successful and cost-effective management for both reasons, often simultaneously.

However, for effi-cient decision-making, this assessment requires knowledge on the demographic rates and long-term dynamics of populations. We used capture–mark–recapture to describe demographic rates for the Serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) at two sites in England and investigate the transition rates between three stages: juve-niles, immatures, and breeders.

40|$|Background: The {{demand for}} {{international}} harmonization in medical education increases {{with the growing}} mobility of students and health professionals. Many medical societies and governmental offices have issued outcome frameworks (OF), which describe aims and contents of medical education based on competencies. These national standards affect the development of curricula as well as <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> <b>licensing</b> procedures. Comparing OF and identifying factors that limit their comparability may thus foster international harmonization of medical education. Summary of Work: We conducted a systematic search for national OF in MedLine, EmBase and the internet. We included all OF in German or English that resulted from a national consensus process and were published or endorsed by a national society or governmental body. We extracted information in five predetermined categories: history of origin, audience, formal structure, medical schooling system and key terms. Summary of Results: Out of 1816 results, 13 OF were included into further analyses. OF reference each other, often without addressing existing differences (e. g. in target audiences). The two most cited OF are “CanMEDs” and “Scottish Doctor”. OF differ especially in their level of detail {{as well as in}} the underlying educational system. Discussion and Conclusions: Based on our results we propose a two-step blueprint for OF, that may help to establish comparability for internationally aligned key features – so-called “core competencies” – while at the same time allowing for necessary regional adaptations in terms of “secondary competencies”. Take-home messages: Considerable differences in at least five categories of OF currently hinder the comparability of outcome frameworks...|$|E
40|$|The Amazon {{region is}} the final {{frontier}} and central focus of Brazilian hydro development, which raises a range of environmental concerns. The largest project in the Amazon is the planned Belo Monte Complex on the Xingu river. If constructed {{it will be the}} second biggest hydroelectric plant in Brazil, third largest on earth. In this study, we analyse the private and social costs, and benefits of the Belo Monte project. Furthermore, we present risk scenarios, considering fluctuations in the project’s feasibility that would result from variations in total costs and power. For our analysis, we create three scenarios. In the first scenario Belo Monte appears feasible, with a net present value (NPV) in the range of US$ 670 million and a rate of return in excess of the 12 % discount rate used in this analysis. The second scenario, where we varied some of the project costs and assumptions based on other economic estimates, shows the project to be infeasible, with a negative NPV of about US$ 3 billion and external costs around US$ 330 million. We also conducted a risk analysis, allowing variation in several of the parameters most important to the project’s feasibility. The simulations brought together the risks of cost overruns, construction delays, lower-than-expected generation and rising social costs. The probability of a positive NPV in these circumstances was calculated to be just 28 %, or there is a 72 % chance that the costs of the Belo Monte dam will be greater than the benefits. Several WCD recommendations are not considered in the project, especially those related to transparency, social participation in the discussion, economic analysis and risk <b>assessment,</b> <b>and</b> <b>licensing</b> of the project. This study underscores the importance of forming a participatory consensus, based on clear, objective information, on whether or not to build the Belo Monte dam...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of clinical competence {{is the main}} purpose of medical education. The long road to become clinically competent starts {{on the first day of}} medical school, and every institution strives to select the best students. The responsibility of medical schools is to train those students to become clinically competent physicians who are highly qualified and specialized professionals able to function in a constantly changing society that puts continuously growing demands on the medical profession. Understanding clinical competence is therefore crucial not only for medical education, <b>assessment,</b> <b>and</b> <b>licensing</b> examinations, but also for society and its responsibility for the quality of health care. However, there is little consensus about what clinical competence is and how to measure it. A proper definition and a better understanding of clinical competence and its components would serve as a criterion for validating medical educational programs and would ! assure a minimum level of competency at the end of medical school and beyond during residency. Each of the previous chapters of this thesis highlights different aspects of clinical competence and its development. In the introductory chapter the lack of consistency in definitions of clinical competence is emphasized and a historical overview is given to shed light on the variety of definitions used over the last decades. The study presented in Chapter 2 explores the effect of level of pre-university performance on preclinical and clinical performance. The study in Chapter 3 addresses the impact of clinical training during clerkships on studentsâ€™ learning. Specifically, the relationship among the nature and volume of patient encounters, quality of supervision, and the learning outcomes were explored. The study of Chapter 4 is directed at the interaction between knowledge and a problem-solving ability during studentsâ€™ diagnostic problem solving at end-of-clerkship examinations. Chapter 5 focuses on clinical competence during clerkships and end-of-clerkship examinatio! ns. In this study we explored whether clinical teachers place different values on individual components of competence while students work on the wards or while students are examined during clerkship examinations. The study reported in Chapter 6 investigates how recall of case information changed for different expertise groups under different conditions, while research discussed in Chapter 7 was conducted to find out how the selection of case information by students and doctors during different stages of the diagnostic process is related to different expertise groups. In the present and final chapter of this thesis the main findings of all previous chapters are summarized and discussed. At the end of this chapter, conclusions and suggestions for further research are given...|$|E

40|$|The neccessity {{of finding}} a {{suitable}} solution for the disposal of radioactive waste {{has led to a}} growing interest in the last few decades in the development of accelerator-driven systems (ADS) which could efficiently perform the transmutation of this waste transforming it to shorter-lived, less hazardous radioactive species. One of the most prominent ADS projects worldwide is MYRRHA (Multi-purpose hYbrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications). MYRRHA is currently under development at the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre (SCK•CEN). MYRRHA consists of a subcritical core coupled to a proton accelerator and cooled by lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE). The use of LBE in ADS such as MYRRHA is supported by advantageousnbsp;properties. However it also presents certain challenges. One important concern with the use ofnbsp;as coolant is the formation of large quantities of 210 Po due to neutron capture reaction with bismuth (Bi). Polonium (Po) is critical to safety of ADS due to its elevatednbsp;and propensity to evaporate. A qualitative and quantitative understanding of Po evaporation from LBE is thus required for safety <b>assessments,</b> design <b>and</b> <b>licensing</b> ofnbsp;nuclear systems. In this work the evaporation of Po from LBE was investigated with the so-called transpiration method under different conditions relevant to MYRRHA. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The project European Airport Movement Management by A-SMGCS (EMMA), an Integrated Project {{launched}} by the European Commission in its sixth framework programme, was executed between March 2004 and April 2006. The aim of the EMMA project was to mature and validate the A-SMGCS concept levels 1 and 2 by setting de facto standards for A-SMGCS systems and their operational usage and by the streamlining of existing products. The EMMA project brought A-SMGCS one further step towards the harmonised European implementation of A-SMGCS. In close cooperation with EUROCONTROL, the advanced operational concept for A-SMGCS levels 1 and 2 has been proven and strengthened by the implementation of levels 1 and 2 A-SMGCS and extensive validation and verification activities at three different European airports: Milano-Malpensa, Prague-Ruzyne, and Toulouse-Blagnac. In Prague-Ruzyne, controllers {{went as far as}} to work with the system in low visibility conditions, although this was not expected within the time-frame of the EMMA project. Measurement indicators and test procedures were defined and a significant amount of data was collected during the functional and operational tests. Controllers and pilots actively participated and contributed to the results. The analysis resulted in detailed recommendations covering: •	the concept of an A-SMGCS levels 1 and 2, •	the technical and operational requirements, •	procedures, •	implementation issues (e. g. safety <b>assessment,</b> training <b>and</b> <b>licensing),</b> <b>and</b> •	detailed recommendations for a harmonised A-SMGCS V and V methodology.
