Wilders was first accused of criminally insulting religious <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> and inciting hatred and discrimination. He {{was found not guilty}} in June 2011. In 2016, he landed in court again and was found guilty of incitement and encouraging discrimination against Moroccans.|$|E
5|$|Utica's neighborhoods have {{historically}} been defined by their residents, allowing them {{to develop their own}} individuality.

5|$|Third class {{passengers}} were {{a diverse group}} of nationalities <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups.</b> In addition to large numbers of British, Irish, and Scandinavian immigrants, there were passengers from Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East (primarily Lebanon and Syria) and Hong Kong. Some travelled alone or in small family groups. Several groups of mothers were travelling alone with their young children—most going to join their husbands who had already gone to America to find jobs, and, having saved up enough money, could now send for their families.|$|E

5|$|The {{sociology}} {{of race and}} of ethnic relations is {{the area of the}} discipline that studies the social, political, and economic relations between races and ethnicities at all levels of society. This area encompasses the study of racism, residential segregation, and other complex social processes between different racial <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups.</b> This research frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as stratification and social psychology, as well as with postcolonial theory. At the level of political policy, ethnic relations are discussed in terms of either assimilationism or multiculturalism. Anti-racism forms another style of policy, particularly popular in the 1960s and 70s.|$|E
5|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} is found among all social, racial <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> {{and has been}} reported {{in all parts of the}} world; it is three to four times more frequent among males than among females. The tics of Tourette syndrome begin in childhood and tend to remit or subside with maturity; thus, a diagnosis may no longer be warranted for many adults, and observed prevalence rates are higher among children than adults. As children pass through adolescence, about one-quarter become tic-free, almost one-half see their tics diminish to a minimal or mild level, and less than one-quarter have persistent tics. Only 5 to 14% of adults experience worse tics in adulthood than in childhood.|$|E
5|$|The NWMP was {{commanded}} by {{a relatively small}} team of commissioned officers, having an establishment of 25 officers in its early years, of whom around a quarter were medical and veterinary officers, rising to 50 after 1885, a ratio of approximately one officer to every twenty enlisted men. The officers were usually from middle- or upper-class backgrounds, and were typically Canadian-born; deliberate {{attempts were made to}} reflect the different religious <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> that made up white Canadian society. They depended on political patronage from the government of the day in Ottawa for their appointment and career progression, and were typically {{selected on the basis of}} their military experience, service in the police ranks or previous study at the Royal Military College in Ontario.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Country <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> {{differences}} on adjustment {{have been demonstrated}} numerous times, {{and the source of}} these differences has been typically interpreted as cultural. We report two studies in which country (Study 1) <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> (Study 2) {{differences on}} depression, anxiety, optimism versus pessimism, well-being, and self-esteem are me-diated by dispositional traits. These findings provide an alternative ex-planation for previously reported country <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> differences on these variables and encourage researchers to consider multiple sources, including traits, in their models and studies. Many country differences have been documented on a host of vari-ables related to adjustment (Diener, Diener, & Diener, 1995; Group...|$|R

40|$|This article extends Stratford's brief {{observations}} about the problematic status of racial <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> statistics {{to a discussion}} of the relationship among these statistics, public policy, and the conceptual status of race and ethnicity. Federal statistics are organizational products that are socially constructed. They represent the implementation of public policies that govern political, social, and economic life. It is the interaction between politics and the subjective meaning of race and ethnicity that is responsible for the continual modification of racial <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> statistics. The article discusses the premises on which racial <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> statistics have been based and illustrates how they were implemented in the instructions of the decennial censuses for classifying the race and ethnicity of the population. The article then summarizes some of the empirical evidence from recent research conducted by federal agencies and social scientists to show that racial <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> statistics produced by government record keeping systems have no objective status. The meaning of race and ethnicity is contextual, situational, and subjective, and, thus, how respondents and observers define these concepts has significant consequences for the quality of federal statistics...|$|R
25|$|The {{results for}} 2001 were coded using the Australian Standard Classification of Cultural <b>and</b> <b>Ethnic</b> <b>Groups</b> (ASCCEG). This {{classification}} of cultural <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> {{is based on}} the geographic area in which a group originated or developed; and the similarity of cultural <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> in terms of social and cultural characteristics. The classification is specific to Australian needs and was developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The classification {{is based on the}} self-perceived group identification approach, using a self assessed response to a direct question. This approach measures the extent to which individuals associate with particular cultural or ethnic groups.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between levels of gender representation <b>and</b> levels of <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> representation in national parliaments. Taagepera (1994) and Lijphart (1999) predicted that because of shared mechanisms and covariates levels of representation in the two forms should be positively correlated. Whilst this paper can identify a number of shared covariates, {{there is no evidence}} of an association between levels of gender <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> representation. The lack of negative association suggests that increasing levels of representation in one form does not necessarily come at the cost of the other. Instead it appears that the salience and politicisation of divisions – approximated by the make-up of society – may shape the relationship between levels of gender <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> representation: representation scores tend to be higher in the forms of representation that are thought to be more salient...|$|R
