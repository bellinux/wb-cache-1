5|$|Angie (Drea de Matteo) {{takes an}} instant dislike {{to her son}} Danny's (Beau Mirchoff) new girlfriend, Ana (Maiara Walsh), who she fears is too fun-loving and not serious enough. However, Danny feels {{comfortable}} talking to Ana, who seems to understand what he has been through. Ana assures Angie she is not going anywhere. Meanwhile, Katherine (Dana Delany) speaks to her psychiatrist at a mental clinic. She says the medicine is working, but she now realizes the person she has become and how much she has hurt her neighbors and friends. Karen (Kathryn Joosten) visits her and asks {{her to come back}} to Wisteria Lane, but Katherine says she will not come back because she does not feel she will be forgiven. Later, Karen returns with Bree, Lynette, Gabrielle and Susan, who comfort Katherine <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> will try to forgive her.|$|E
25|$|ICV-EUiA ecosocialist and Catalan {{nationalist}} coalition (ICV hold 10 {{seats and}} EUiA hold 3): ICV, an eco-socialist group, defends {{the right to}} self-determination, but party leaders have never responded {{as to how they}} would vote in a referendum <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> are a union of federalists and separatists. Joan Herrera, current leader of ICV, has declared he will not vote in the participation process.|$|E
25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E

25|$|Several studies {{reveal that}} France seems to be, among the Western countries, {{the one where}} Muslims {{integrate}} the best and feel the most for their country. French Muslims also have the most positive opinions about their fellow citizens of different faiths. The study from the Pew Research Center on Integration {{is an example of}} works revealing this typically French phenomenon. In Paris and the surrounding Île-de-France region where French Muslims tend to be more educated and religious, the vast majority rejects violence <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> are loyal to France according to studies by Euro-Islam, a comparative research network on Islam and Muslims in the West sponsored by GSRL Paris/CNRS France and Harvard University. On the other hand, a 2013 IPSOS survey published by the French daily Le Monde indicated that only 26% of French respondents believed that Islam was compatible with French society (compared to 89% identifying Catholicism as compatible and 75% identifying Judaism as compatible). A thorough survey by the Pew Research Center in Spring 2014 revealed that out of all Europeans, the French view Muslim minorities most favorably with 72% having a favourable opinion.|$|E
500|$|... "Pets was Pets. Mongrels is Mongrels. If, as a viewer, you can {{sit down}} <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> are the same, then there is little point of making any new shows, if the {{slightest}} similarity (puppets and animals) can be suggested as idea stealing. I am surprised Basil Brush hasn't been on the blower, as he is a fox, and that must be a copy! Right? I worked on both, and {{know for a fact}} where they both come from. Two very different ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|Anjuli Bawa, a parent-activist {{and founder}} of Action Dyslexia Delhi, said {{that the number of}} parents who visit her office {{increased}} tenfold in the months following the film's release. Many began taking a more proactive approach by contacting her after noticing problems, rather than using her as a last resort. Gupte himself received [...] "many painful letters and phone calls" [...] from Indian parents. He noted, [...] "Fathers weep on the phone <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> saw the film and realized that they have been wrong in the way they treated their children. This is catharsis." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the {{vacation}} season, the Phanceys entrust Viv with looking after the motel for the night before the owner, Mr. Sanguinetti, can arrive to take inventory and close it up for the winter. Two mobsters, [...] "Sluggsy" [...] Morant and Sol [...] "Horror" [...] Horowitz, both of whom work for Sanguinetti, arrive <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> are there to look over the motel for insurance purposes. The two have been hired by Sanguinetti to burn down the motel so that Sanguinetti can make a profit on the insurance. The blame for the fire would fall on Viv, who was to perish in the incident. The mobsters are cruel to Viv and, when she says she does not want to dance with them, they attack her, holding her down and starting to remove her top. They are about to continue the attack with her rape when the door buzzer interrupts them.|$|E
500|$|The BBC Deputy Director General, Mark Byford, also {{defended the}} {{decision}} {{on the day of}} the programme, saying: [...] " [...] should have the right to be heard, be challenged, and for the public who take part in Question Time and the viewers to make up their own minds about the views of the BNP. It's not for the BBC to censor <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> can't be on". The BBC's chief political adviser, Ric Bailey, stated after the failed appeal that the BBC [...] "would have been breaking its charter if it had not treated the BNP with impartiality ... We absolutely stand by that judgement, even though there's obviously been a lot of controversy about it". A senior BBC presenter, John Humphrys, said the decision was [...] "absolutely right". He said: [...] "Why should we be afraid of what they have to say? Free speech is the issue here, and the BBC's obligations." [...] However, broadcasting unions said some of its members would protest at the invitation.|$|E
500|$|Cohen and Ken Keeler {{traveled}} to New York {{to work with}} the Beastie Boys for their role. They waited three days for the Beastie Boys to call <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> were willing to record but eventually gave up and returned to the studios in Los Angeles. The audio tracks were recorded later. Adam [...] "MCA" [...] Yauch was unavailable {{at the time of the}} recording so only Adam [...] "King Adrock" [...] Horovitz and Michael [...] "Mike D" [...] Diamond voice themselves in the episode, with Horovitz also voicing Yauch. The Beastie Boys perform three songs in the episode: their 1998 hit single [...] "Intergalactic", [...] "Super Disco Breakin", and a brief a capella version of [...] "Sabotage". It was initially requested that they perform [...] "Fight for Your Right" [...] but they declined. The episode also contains Futuramas first original musical number. The lyrics to [...] "Welcome to Robot Hell" [...] were written by Kaplan and Keeler and the music was written by Keeler and Christopher Tyng. When praised for his performance in the audio commentary, John DiMaggio, the voice of Bender, noted that the most difficult part of the performance was singing in a lower octave rather than keeping up with the song's fast pace.|$|E

500|$|In August 2016, Singer {{said that}} Legion had been {{designed}} {{to fit into the}} X-Men universe, but also to stand alone, so [...] "you wouldn't have to label" [...] the relationship between the series and the films. Hawley explained that because the series is depicting the title character's [...] "subjective reality", it would not have to address any connections to the films straight away, noting that his series Fargo, which is connected to the 1996 film of the same name, at first [...] "had to stand on its own feet" [...] before exploring those connections more; [...] "We have to earn the right {{to be part of this}} universe. My hope is we create something so strong that the people in the movie studio call <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> would be foolish enough not to connect these things." [...] He did state that [...] "you can't tell this story without" [...] acknowledging that Legion is the son of Charles Xavier, who appears in the films. This acknowledgement comes in [...] "Chapter 7", with the appearance of Xavier's signature wheelchair in one of Haller's memories. Hawley explained that Haller would look to learn more of his father in future seasons, with Xavier potentially making a physical appearance in the series at that point.|$|E

2500|$|... “I {{remember}} {{one day we}} tricked two dumb high-school girls from town into the fraternity house and made them put out for all the fellows there who wanted them by threatening to call up their parents <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> were putting out for us.

2500|$|... "I am {{the kind}} of Christian who {{believes}} {{that the most important}} theological principle is the principle of positive doubt. Even Christ doubted, on the cross. And I think if people say they hear the voice of God all the time <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> know what to do, then impose that on you, politically, it is theological tyranny. Whereas if you have doubt, it stops you from abusing your religious belief. Religion can be so abused in the interests of power, especially on behalf of institutions and governments." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 1, 2009 in {{response}} to a question on CBS's Face the Nation as to who spoke for the Republican Party, President Obama's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel said it was Rush Limbaugh because [...] "whenever a Republican criticizes , they have to run back and apologize to him, <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> were misunderstood. He is the voice and the intellectual force and energy behind the Republican Party. And he has been upfront about what he views, and hasn't stepped back from that, which is he hopes for [...] failure. He said it. And I compliment him for his honesty, but that's their philosophy that is enunciated by Rush Limbaugh." ...|$|E

2500|$|Facing these setbacks, the ATNM made {{a series}} of {{concessions}} to the government. On 25 January they released the final three Malian soldiers they had held, and requested the government release seven ATNM fighters. [...] On 2 February, Amed Ag Oussouf – reputedly Ibrahim Ag Bahanga's lieutneant—called on the government to accept Algerian mediation and an immediate cease fire. The group had previously rejected an Algerian peace deal accepted by the remainder of the ADC, and on 25 January, Ag Bahanga had told an Algerian paper that their only alternative was armed conflict. [...] The Malian Armed Forces stated on that same day that they would not engage in talks with Ag Bahanga's fighters, describing them as [...] "bandits". Malian forces set up a forward base in the Kidal Region <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> have killed 31 ATNM fighters since 22 January.|$|E
