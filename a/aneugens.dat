40|$|Distinguishing between clastogens and <b>aneugens</b> {{is vital}} in cancer risk {{assessment}} because the default {{assumption is that}} clastogens and <b>aneugens</b> have linear and non-linear dose-response curves, respectively. Any observed non-linearity must be supported by mode of action (MOA) analyses where biological mechanisms are linked with dose-response evaluations. For <b>aneugens,</b> the MOA has been well characterised as disruptors of mitotic machinery where chromosome loss via micronuclei (MN) formation is an accepted endpoint used in risk assessment. In this study we performed the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay and immunofluorescence mitotic machinery visualisation in human lymphoblastoid (AHH- 1) and Chinese Hamster fibroblast (V 79) cell lines after treatment with the aneugen 17 -b-oestradiol (E 2). Results were compared to previously published data on bisphenol-A (BPA) and Rotenone data. Two concentration-response approaches (the threshold-[Td] and benchmark-dose [BMD] approaches) were applied to derive {{a point of departure}} (POD) for in vitro MN induction. BMDs were also derived from the most sensitive carcinogenic endpoint. Ranking comparisons of the PODs from the in vitro MN and the carcinogenicity studies demonstrated a link between these two endpoints for BPA, E 2 and Rotenone. This analysis was extended to include 5 additional <b>aneugens,</b> 5 clastogens and 3 mutagens and further concentration and dose-response correlations were observed between PODs from the in vitro MN and carcinogenicity.

40|$|Detection of clastogenic {{compounds}} in the peripheral blood micronucleus test (MNT) in rats is a well-established methodology. However, {{the results obtained}} on the induction of micronuclei by <b>aneugens</b> in rat peripheral blood are controversial. Our aim was a comparative evaluation of the peripheral blood flow cytometry MNT in Wistar Han rat and CD 1 mouse exposed to three <b>aneugens</b> (vinblastine, vincristine and colchicine) after single-dose applications. In addition, the same compounds were tested in the rat bone marrow MNT. The treatment with vinblastine (0. 25, 0. 5, 1, mg/kg), vincristine (0. 025, 0. 05, 0. 1 mg/kg) or colchicine (0. 7, 1, 1. 3 mg/kg) induced no statistically significant increase in MN-PCEs (micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes or reticulocytes) in rat peripheral blood. In rat bone marrow, a clear statistically significant increase in MN-PCE was found with vincristine and vinblastine. However, colchicine showed a clear increase in MN-PCE frequency without reaching statistically significant level only at 1 mg/kg. The positive effect in the bone marrow MNT shows that the target organ was exposed to the appropriate concentration levels of the respective <b>aneugens.</b> In mouse, the peripheral blood flow cytometry analysis after the treatment with vinblastine, vincristine and colchicine showed clear statistically significant increase in MN-PCE with all three compounds. The experiments with splenectomized rats treated with vincristine and colchicine were performed and statistically significant increases in MN-PCE were found with 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 15 mg/kg of vincristine and 0. 7 and 1 mg/kg of colchicine. Our results demonstrate that micronucleated cells induced by <b>aneugens</b> are removed from rat peripheral blood by the spleen due to the large size of micronuclei. Based on our data, it is concluded that the flow cytometry peripheral blood MNT after single-dose applications is an appropriate test system for evaluating the genotoxic effects of <b>aneugens</b> in mice. However, in rats peripheral blood MNT aneugen detection might require multiple-dose applications to overwhelm the spleen effec...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2013. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Combinations of genotoxic agents have frequently been assessed without clear assumptions regarding their expected (additive) mixture effects, often leading to claims of synergisms that might {{in fact be}} compatible with additivity. We have shown earlier that the combined effects of chemicals, which induce micronuclei (MN) in the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay in Chinese hamster ovary-K 1 cells by a similar mechanism, were additive according {{to the concept of}} concentration addition (CA). Here, we extended these studies and investigated for the first time whether valid additivity expectations can be formulated for MN-inducing chemicals that operate through a variety of mechanisms, including <b>aneugens</b> and clastogens (DNA cross-linkers, topoisomerase II inhibitors, minor groove binders). We expected that their effects should follow the additivity principles of independent action (IA). With two mixtures, one composed of various <b>aneugens</b> (colchicine, flubendazole, vinblastine sulphate, griseofulvin, paclitaxel), and another composed of <b>aneugens</b> and clastogens (flubendazole, doxorubicin, etoposide, melphalan and mitomycin C), we observed mixture effects that fell between the additivity predictions derived from CA and IA. We achieved better agreement between observation and prediction by grouping the chemicals into common assessment groups and using hybrid CA/IA prediction models. The combined effects of four dissimilarly acting compounds (flubendazole, paclitaxel, doxorubicin and melphalan) also fell within CA and IA. Two binary mixtures (flubendazole/paclitaxel and flubendazole/doxorubicin) showed effects in reasonable agreement with IA additivity...|$|E

40|$|The {{human in}} vitro {{micronucleus}} (MN) test {{has become a}} fast and reliable assay for mutagenicity testing. Currently, this assay is mostly performed with cytochalasin B, which prevents cytokinesis, resulting in polynucleated cells. The number of nuclei per cell indicates the number of nuclear divisions that have occurred since the addition of cyto-chalasin B. It is recommended that MN are only counted in binucleated lymphocytes, because these cells have ®nished one nuclear division. Therefore, almost no atten-tion {{has been paid to}} MN in mononucleated cells. However, recent studies have indicated that <b>aneugens,</b> but not clastogens, also induce MN in mononucleates. In order to evaluate mononucleates to distinguish between aneu-genic and clastogenic effects, we tested some typical aneu-gens and clastogens in whole blood lymphocyte cultures of four donors with the cytokinesis block micronucleus (CBMN) assay. Results showed that the <b>aneugens</b> diethyl-stilbestrol (80 mM), griseofulvin (25 mg/ml) and vincristine sulphate (15 mg/ml) increased MN frequencies in mono-nucleated and binucleated cells, whilst the clastogens mitomycin C (500 ng/ml), bleomycin (6 mg/ml) and doxo-rubicin (20 mg/ml) increased MN frequency only in binucleates. We also tested the Y heterochromatin decon-densing drug berenil (300 mg/ml). Berenil induced an extremely high number of MN in mononucleated as well as in binucleated cells, indicating an aneugenic action. This was con®rmed by centromere labelling.

The use of the micronucleus test in rats, however, has been problematic because the spleen of adult rats efficiently removes micronucleated erythrocytes from the blood. In the present study, we have treated 5 -day-old rats with either X-rays (a clastogen) or vinblastine (an <b>aneugen)</b> and measured micronuclei in erythrocytes from the blood and liver. Each treatment increased the frequency of micronuclei in both tissues, with the percentages of CREST-staining micronuclei reflecting the mechanism of micronucleus induction by the two agents.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{micronucleus}} assay is broadly used, {{but is not}} per se able to discriminate aneugenic from clastogenic compounds, and cytotoxicity can be a confounding factor. In vitro genotoxicity assays generally rely on cell lines with limited metabolic capabilities. Recently, the use of histone H 2 AX and H 3 phosphorylation markers (γH 2 AX and p-H 3) was proposed to discriminate aneugenic from clastogenic chemicals. The aim {{of the present study}} was to develop a new genotoxic screening strategy based on the use of the γH 2 AX and p-H 3 biomarkers in combination with cell lines with distinct biotransformation properties. First, we tested a training set of 20 model chemicals comprised of 10 <b>aneugens,</b> five clastogens and five cytotoxics on three human cell lines (HepG 2, LS- 174 T and ACHN). Our data confirm the robustness of these two biomarkers to discriminate efficiently clastogens, <b>aneugens</b> and misleading cytotoxic chemicals in HepG 2 cells. Aneugenic compounds induced either an increase or a decrease in p-H 3 depending on their mode of action. Clastogens induced γH 2 AX, and cytotoxic compounds generated a marked decrease in these two biomarkers. Moreover, the use of different cell lines permits to discriminate direct from bioactivated genotoxins without the need of an exogenous metabolic activation system. Finally, we further evaluated this strategy using a test set of 13 chemicals with controversial genotoxic potential. The resulting data demonstrate that the combined analysis of γH 2 AX and p-H 3 is an efficient strategy. Notably, we demonstrated that three compounds (fisetin, hydroquinone and okadaic acid) display both aneugenic and clastogenic properties...|$|E
40|$|The marine {{environment}} provides a sink {{for a host}} of toxic chemicals, directly or inadvertently, released as a result of human activity. Some of these chemicals have the potential to act as <b>aneugens,</b> substances that cause numerical chromosomal aberrations (NCAs). NCAs {{are one of the most}} important classes of genetic abnormality and are implicated in a variety of deleterious effects, including premature ageing, birth defects and cancer. Clearly, any increase in the incidence of these agents in the {{marine environment}} poses a risk to the indigenous biota and its predators, including man. In this paper, we describe our recent success with applying the fluorescence in situ hybridisation technique (FISH) to detect NCAs in the interphase cell nuclei of Pomatoceros lamarckii, a common rocky shore invertebrate. Given the lack of requirement for any detailed cytogenetic knowledge, the method holds considerable promise for laboratory and field studies in general, and should lend itself to automated screening protocols, where large numbers of cells can be screened rapidly, for example, using a flow cytometer. When exposed either under acute or chronic (viz. adult) exposure conditions, colchicine and di-butylphthalate (DBP) (a widely-used plasticiser), two recognised <b>aneugens,</b> induced significant increases in the levels of NCAs, in the dose range 1 × 10 − 6 – 5 × 10 − 6 M, in both four to eight cell embryo stages and 24 h-old larvae.

40|$|In {{the present}} study an {{automated}} image analysis assisted in vitro micronucleus assay was developed with the rodent cell line CHO-k 1 and the human hepatoma cell line HepG 2, which are both commonly used in regulatory genotoxicity assays.

These properties may result in an assay with a high predictivity for in vivo genotoxicity. The assays with CHO-k 1 and HepG 2 cells were both evaluated by testing a set of compounds recommended by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), among which are in vivo genotoxins and non-genotoxins. The CHO-k 1 cell line showed a high sensitivity (percentage of genotoxic compounds that gave a positive result: 80 %; 16 / 20) and specificity (percentage of non-genotoxic compounds that came out negative: 88 %; 37 / 42). Although the sensitivity of the HepG 2 cell line was lower (60 %; 12 / 20), the specificity was high (88 %; 37 / 42). These results were confirmed by testing an additional series of 16 genotoxic compounds. For both the CHO-k 1 and the HepG 2 cell line it was possible to size-classify micronuclei, enabling distinguishing <b>aneugens</b> from clastogens. It is concluded that two high-throughput micronucleus assays were developed that can detect genotoxic potential and allow differentiation between clastogens and <b>aneugens.</b> The performance scores of the CHO-k 1 and HepG 2 cell lines for in vivo genotoxicity were high.

Mitomycin C and colchicine were used as positive controls for clastogen and <b>aneugen,</b> respectively, and these compounds produced the expected responses. The fluorescence in situ hybridization assay with a centromeric DNA probe for erythrocyte micronuclei showed that epirubicin is not only clastogenic but also aneugenic in somatic cells in vivo. By using the BrdU-incorporation assay, it could be shown that the meiotic delay caused by epirubicin in germ cells was approximately 48 h. Disomic and diploid sperm were shown in epididymal sperm hybridized with DNA probes specific for chromosomes 8, X and Y after epirubicin treatment. The observation that XX- and YY-sperm significantly prevailed over XY-sperm indicates missegregation during the second meiotic division. The results also suggest that earlier prophase stages contribute less to epirubicin-induced aneuploidy. Both the clastogenic and aneugenic potential of epirubicin can give rise to the development of secondary tumors and abnormal reproductive outcomes in cured cancer patients and medical personnel exposed to epirubicin...|$|R

Arsenic is a potential clastogen and <b>aneugen.</b> In general, {{the majority of the}} studies on clastogenic effects of arsenic are based on frequency of micronuclei (MN) study in peripheral lymphocytes, urothelial and oral epithelial cells. To find out the most suitable cell type, here, we compared cytogenetic damage through MN assay in (a) various populations exposed to arsenic through drinking water retrieved from literature review, as also (b) arsenic-induced Bowen's patients from our own survey. Results For literature review, we have searched the Pubmed database for English language journal articles using the following keywords: "arsenic", "micronuclei", "drinking water", and "human" in various combinations. We have selected 13 studies consistent with our inclusion criteria that measured micronuclei in either {{one or more of the}} above-mentioned three cell types, in human samples. Compared to urothelial and buccal mucosa cells, the median effect sizes measured by the difference between people with exposed and unexposed, lymphocyte based MN counts were found to be stronger. This general pattern pooled from 10 studies was consistent with our own set of three earlier studies. MN counts were also found to be stronger for lymphocytes even in arsenic-induced Bowen's patients (cases) compared to control individuals having arsenic-induced non-cancerous skin lesions.

Non-linear dose–responses have been reported for low doses of genotoxic compounds with diverse indirect (e.g. <b>aneugens,</b> topoisomerase inhibitors etc.) and direct deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) reactive mechanisms (e.g. alkylating agents) and the shape of the respective dose–response appears to be dependent on related cytoprotective cellular processes. It is however unlikely that small genotoxic effects, i.e. within the normal background range, can be excluded experimentally. Thus, published data mostly report practical thresholds where non-linear dose–responses are described through statistical approaches to define a point of departure. The least complex are the single effect levels such as the no observed genotoxic effect level (NOGEL) and the lowest observed genotoxic effect level (LOGEL). The regulatory approach to such compounds can be based on the identification of a NOGEL and use of uncertainty factors to calculate a permissible daily exposure when data are available.|$|E

DNA from the metacentric chromosomes was amplified by PCR using the linker/adaptor method. In this pilot study, mouse was whole-body irradiated with 1, 2 and 3 Gy and aberrations were scored in metaphase spreads of splenocytes cultured in vitro.

In order to extend in vitro maturation tests to earlier stages of oogenesis, an in vitro assay with mouse preantral follicle cultures has been established. It permits the identi®cation of direct and also indirect effects of environmental chem-icals on the somatic compartment, the follicle and theca cells, {{that may lead to}} disturbances of oocyte growth, mat-uration and chromosome segregation.

Although a variety of reproductive complications have been ascribed to compounds with androgenic or estrogenic properties, {{little attention has been}} directed at the potential consequences of such exposures to the genetic quality of the gamete. Results: A sudden, spontaneous increase in meiotic disturbances, including aneuploidy, in studies of oocytes from control female mice in our laboratory coincided with the accidental exposure of our animals to an environmental source of bisphenol A (BPA). BPA is an estrogenic compound widely used in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. We identified damaged caging material as the source of the exposure, as we were able to recapitulate the meiotic abnormalities by intentionally damaging cages and water bottles. In subsequent studies of female mice, we administered daily oral doses of BPA to directly test the hypothesis that low levels of BPA disrupt female meiosis. Our results demonstrated that the meiotic effects were dose dependent and could be induced by environmentally relevant doses of BPA. Conclusions: Both the initial inadvertent exposure and subsequent experimental studies suggest that BPA is a potent meiotic <b>aneugen.</b> Specifically, in the female mouse, short-term, low-dose exposure during the final stages of oocyte growth is sufficient to elicit detectable meiotic effects. These results provide the first unequivocal link between mammalian meiotic aneuploidy and an accidental environmental exposure and suggest that the oocyte and its meiotic spindle will provide a sensitive assay system for the study of reproductive toxins...|$|R

This is of major concern for accurate assessment of hazard related to exposure to mutagens. In the present work we studied the influence of caspases, the key regulat-ors of the apoptotic process, on the induction of micronuclei in the cytokinesis block micronucleus assay. For this, we applied a combined approach in which both human peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMC) and the paired human breast carcinoma cell lines MCF- 7, which is caspase- 3 deficient, and the caspase- 3 transfected MCF- 7 (MCF- 7 casp- 3) were used to study the influence of caspase activity on micronuclei. When nocodazole induced apop-tosis was inhibited {{by the use of}} inhibitors of the two main apical caspases- 8 and- 9 in PBMC, the frequencies of micronucleated binucleates (MNCB) increased with inhibi-tion of these caspases confirming that apoptosis can elimin-ate micronucleated cells. On the contrary when caspase- 3 was inhibited, the frequencies of MNCB was lower, suggest-ing a role of caspase- 3, also in micronuclei formation. To verify this hypothesis, we compared the induction of apoptosis and micronuclei by the <b>aneugen</b> nocodazole, the clastogen methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) and the non-mutagenic apoptogen staurosporin in MCF- 7 and MCF- 7 casp- 3 cells.

Using nominal or cellular dose did not show statistically significant differences. Likewise, alkaline comet assay and FISH-centromeric probing of MNBN indicated a weak and not statistically significant induction of oxidative DNA damage, chromosome breakage and chromosome loss.

40|$|At the Washington “ 2 nd International Workshop on Genotoxicity Testing” (25 – 26 March 1999) current methodologies {{and data}} for the in vitro {{micronucleus}} test were reviewed. As a result, guidelines {{for the conduct of}} specific aspects of the protocol were developed. Agreement was achieved on the following topics: choice of cells, slide preparation, analysis of micronuclei, toxicity, use of cytochalasin-B, number of doses, and treatment/harvest times [Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 35 (2000) 167]. Because {{there were a number of}} important in vitro micronucleus validation studies in progress, it was not possible to design a definitive, internationally harmonized protocol at that time. These studies have now been completed and the data were reviewed at the Plymouth “ 3 rd International Workshop on Genotoxicity Testing” (28 – 29 June 2002). Data from studies coordinated by the French Society of Genetic Toxicology, Japanese collaborative studies, European pharmaceutical industry validation studies, along with data from Lilly Research Laboratories were used to prepare conclusions on the main aspects of the in vitro micronucleus protocol. In this paper, the consensus agreements on the protocol for performing the in vitro micronucleus assay are presented. The major recommendations concern: 1. Demonstration of cell proliferation: both cell lines and lymphocytes can be used, but demonstration of cell proliferation in both control and treated cells is compulsory for the acceptance of the test. 2. Assessment of toxicity and dose range finding: assessment of toxicity should be performed by determining cell proliferation, e. g. increased cell counts (CC) or population doubling (PD) without cytochalasin-B, or e. g. cytokinesis-block proliferation index with cytochalasin-B; and by determining other markers for cytotoxicity (confluency, apoptosis, necrosis) which can provide valuable additional information. 3. Treatment schedules for cell lines and lymphocytes. 4. Choice of positive controls: without S 9 -mix both a clastogen (e. g. mitomycin C or bleomycin) and an <b>aneugen</b> (e. g. colchicine) should be included as positive controls and a clastogen that requires S 9 for activity when S 9 -mix is used (e. g. dimethylnitrosamine, or cyclophosphamide in those cell types that cannot activate this agent directly). 5. Duplicate cultures and number of cells to be scored. 6. Repeat experiments: in lymphocytes, for each experiment blood from 2 different healthy young and non-smoking donors should be compared. In cell lines, the experiments need only to be repeated if the first one is negative. 7. Statistics: statistical significance should not be the sole factor for determining positive results. Biological meaning should serve as a guideline. Examples of statistical analyses are given.

40|$|When legally {{required}} {{mutagenicity testing}} of chemicals is undertaken, the important genetic end point of aneuploidy {{is not included}} because validated test methods are lacking. Therefore, the Commission of the European Communities (CEC) has funded a research program to develop and validate tests for aneuploidy induction. Ten chemicals, {{selected on the basis}} of their ability to interact with cell organelles relevant for aneuploidy induction, were tested in 11 laboratories. The assays ranged from in vitro tubulin assembly studies to in vivo germ-cell tests. The results allow several conclusions: a) Fungal aneuploidy tests are not capable of detecting inhibitors of mammalian tubulin polymerization such as colchicine and vinblastine. Therefore, they will not play a role in screening for aneuploidy but are of value for studying the relationship between induced aneuploidy and recombination. b) Chemicals that induce aneuploidy in mammalian germ cells are readily detected in the in vitro mammalian cell systems. Some chemicals such as thiabendazole and thimerosal induce aneuploidy in vitro but do not appear to be very effective in vivo. c) Cell division aberrations induced in mammalian cells in vitro seem to be predictive for aneuploidy induction in the same cell type. Likewise, c-mitotic effects and cell cycle delay in vivo in mitotic and meiotic cells correlate with aneuploidy induction in the respective tissue. A second CEC Aneuploidy Program has started recently to refine the most promising test protocols, to provide understanding of the variety of mechanisms by which chemicals induce aneuploidy, and to establish a data base for <b>aneugens</b> among environmental pollutants...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} for the in vitro cytochalasin‐B human {{lymphocyte}} micronucleus (MN) test, the quantification of the DNA content of MN and the difference in DNA content between the two macronuclei in the binucleate cells without MN, as measured by image analysis, gives a first estimation of the aneugenic potential of a test compound. Cultures of isolated human lymphocytes were exposed either to γ‐rays as a clastogen or to carbendazim (MBC) as an an‐eugen. The lymphocytes were stained with Feulgen stain and the MN were analyzed for DNA content with a Magiscan 2 A image analyzer. The mean DNA content of MN induced by MBC were statistically higher than γ‐irradiation‐induced MN. It was demonstrated that in culture the lymphocytes, {{as well as the}} MN, are in different stages of the cell cycle, but this will not affect the discriminating power of the MN DNA content when only G 1 cells are considered, or when DNA content of the MN is expressed relative to the total genome. The identification of Gl and G 2 cell populations from image analysis data was performed by extrapolation of DNA content data from Gl‐ and G 2 ‐sorted lymphocytes with a FacStar plus flow sorter. It was demonstrated that in MBC‐treated cells the DNA rearrangement between the macronuclei in binucle‐ates without MN was on the average higher than in γ‐irradiated and untreated cells, which points to aneugenic effects of MBC without the formation of MN. In contrast to DNA content measurements, the area of the MN is not a reliable measure for discriminating clastogens from <b>aneugens.</b> © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc. Copyright © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

40|$|The {{multicopy}} lgt 10 -lacZ transgene {{shuttle vector}} of MutaMouse {{serves as an}} important tool for genotoxicity studies. Here, we describe a model for lgt 10 -lacZ transgene molecular structure, based on characterisation of trans-genes recovered from animals of our intramural breeding colony. Unique nucleotide sequences of the 47 513 bp monomer are reported with GenBank assigned accession numbers. Besides defining ancestral mutations of the lgt 10 used to construct the transgene and the MutaMouse precursor (strain 40. 6), we validated the sequence integrity of key l genes needed for the Escherichia coli host-based mutation reporting assay. Using three polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based chromosome scanning and cloning strategies, we found five distinct in vivo transgene rear-rangements, which were common to both sexes, and involved copy fusions generating 10 defective copies per haplotype. The transgene haplotype was estimated by Southern hybridisation and real-time–polymerase chain reaction, which yielded 29. 0 6 4. 0 copies based on spleen DNA of MutaMouse, and a reconstructed CD 2 F 1 genome with variable lgt 10 -lacZ copies. Similar analysis of commercially prepared spleen DNA from Big Blue mouse yielded a haplotype of 23. 5 6 3. 1 copies. The latter DNA is used in calibrating a commercial in vitro packaging kit for E. coli host-based mutation assays of both transgenic systems. The model for lgt 10 -lacZ transgene organisation, and the PCR-based methods for assessing copy number, integrity and rearrangements, potentially extends the use of MutaMouse construct for direct, genomic-type assays that detect the effects of clastogens and <b>aneugens,</b> without depending on an E. coli host, for reporting effects...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{in vitro}} {{micronucleus}} test is considered as an attractive tool for genotoxicity testing of chemicals {{because of its}} simplicity of scoring and wide applicability in different cell types. However, most of the cells currently in use are devoid of the enzyme equipment required for activation of promutagens in the genotoxic metabolites. We postulated that the human HepaRG cell line, which can express xenobiotic metabolising enzymes at levels close {{to those found in}} primary human hepatocytes and has retained the indefinite growth capacity of transformed cells, could represent a more suitable model for genotoxicity testing of chemicals requiring metabolic activation. Based on the recommendations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development test guideline TG 487 for testing of chemicals, HepaRG cell cultures containing > 80 % mature hepatocytes were treated in situ with various chemicals for 24 h followed by a 3 -day mitogenic stimulation with epidermal growth factor without cytokinesis block. In such culture conditions, HepaRG cells underwent > 1. 5 cell cycle per cell during the mitogenic stimulation. While non-genotoxic compounds (mannitol and staurosporine) did not increase the rate of micronucleated mononucleated cells, all <b>aneugens</b> (colchicine, nocodazole and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) as well as the direct acting clastogen methyl methanesulfonate and clastogens requiring metabolic activation (aflatoxin B 1, benzo(a) pyrene and 2 -nitrofluorene) induced a statistically significant concentration-related {{increase in the number of}} mono-micronucleated cells. The micronucleus test was also performed after 7 -day repeat exposure of HepaRG cells to the chemicals. Noticeably, a time-dependent effect was obtained with the three clastogens requiring metabolic activation. In conclusion, our results obtained with HepaRG hepatocytes exposed to various genotoxic compounds requiring or not bioactivation, compared favorably with those reported in various other cell types. They support the view that metabolically competent HepaRG cells have unique potential benefits for testing genotoxic compounds using the in vitro micronucleus assay...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecent {{publications}} on {{the automated}} in vitro micronucleus assay show predictive values higher than 85 % for {{the classification of}} in vitro <b>aneugens,</b> clastogens and non-genotoxic compounds. In the present work, the CHO-k 1 micronucleus assay in combination with cellular imaging was further evaluated. Firstly, {{the effect of a}} range of S 9 concentrations on micronucleus formation and cytotoxicity was investigated. Subsequently, the reproducibility and predictivity of the micronucleus assay on CHO-k 1 cells was investigated with a set of four compounds. Then, a larger set of compounds (n= 44) was tested on CHO-k 1 cells and inter-laboratory correlation was calculated. Finally, cellular imaging was compared with flow cytometry for in vivo assessment of micronucleus formation. The concentration of S 9 {{had a significant impact on}} micronucleus formation and cytotoxicity. In addition, calculations of relative cell count (RCC) and cytokinesis-block proliferation index (CBPI) showed to be complementary to cytotoxicity assessment. The CHO-k 1 micronucleus assay correctly classified the four reference compounds, with a dose-response relationship and low variability. Based on a larger set of compounds, the assay proved to be reliable with a sensitivity of 94 % (n = 31) and a specificity of 85 % (n = 13). A correlation coefficient of 97 % was obtained when the lowest observable adverse effect levels (LOAELs) from our study were compared with those published by Diaz et al. (2007) [10]. In conclusion, the in vitro CHO-k 1 micronucleus assay combined with cellular imaging is a predictive assay appropriate for genotoxicity screening at early stages of drug development. In addition, for in vivo assessment of micronucleus formation, we preferred to use flow cytometry rather than cell imaging. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{application}} of the concept of a threshold to risk assessment is widespread, there remains little experi-mental evidence for the existence of thresholds for geno-toxic compounds, other than <b>aneugens.</b> The clastogenicity of topoisomerase inhibitors is believed to result from the transient stabilization of the topoisomerase enzyme with DNA during the catalytic cycle. This leads to the forma-tion of a stabilized cleavage complex, which, in turn, may result in the formation of a DNA strand break. This indir-ect mechanism of clastogenicity is the basis for the concept of threshold for this class of drug. Using micronucleus induction in L 5178 Y mouse lymphoma cells as a genotoxic end-point, a three pronged approach was used to examine whether the concept of a threshold for clastogenicity could be demonstrated for topoisomerase type II inhibitors in vitro. This involved (i) the study of mechanism (TARDIS assay), (ii) hypothesis testing versus estimation (i. e. scoring up to 10 000 cells/treatment at concentrations immediately above and below the NOEL for micronucleus induction) and (iii) statistical modelling of the concentration±response curves for micronucleus induc-tion. Several topoisomerase type II inhibitors were investi-gated with varying clastogenic potencies (etoposide = doxorubicin < genistein < cipro¯oxacin). Pragmatic thresholds for clastogenicity in L 5178 Y cells were de®ned at 0. 00236 mg/ml for etoposide, 0. 00151 mg/ml for doxoru-bicin, 1 mg/ml for genistein and 50 mg/ml for cipro¯oxacin. In addition, it was demonstrated that etoposide-induced clastogenicity was concentration and time dependent. These results, along with mechanistic data showing that all of the compounds induced concentration-dependent increases in the formation of topoisomerase II stabilized cleavage complexes, provide a weight of evidence to sup-port a threshold concept for clastogenicity with topoisome-rase II poisons...|$|E
40|$|Two major {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} chromosome segregation errors are non-disjunction and chromosome loss, both leading to aneuploidy. Previous studies in our laboratory showed {{the existence of}} thresholds for the induction of chromosome non-disjunction and chromosome loss and the induction of apoptosis by microtubule inhibitors. From a mechanistic point of view one can expect that apoptosis contributes to the elimination of cells with premutagenic/mutagenic lesions. If aneuploid cells were eliminated by the induction of apoptosis below the threshold concentrations for chromosome loss and non-disjunction, the defined thresholds would not be applicable to cells unable to undergo apoptosis. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether apoptosis was induced directly or indirectly as a response to aberrant chromosome segregation below the thresholds for the induction of chromosome loss and non-disjunction, as previously defined by us. Therefore, human lymphocytes were exposed in vitro to five concentrations of nocodazole and five concentrations of carbendazim representing the threshold concentrations for chromosome non-disjunction and chromosome loss, two concentrations below the lowest threshold and one concentration between the two threshold values. After 48 h exposure to the <b>aneugens,</b> induction of apoptosis was analysed by the annexin-V test. The frequencies of chromosome non-disjunction and chromosome loss were estimated in cytokinesis-blocked human lymphocytes in combination with FISH; this methodology was applied to whole cell cultures as well as to apoptotic and viable cell fractions obtained using magnetic annexin microbead cell sorting. Our results suggest that elimination of aneuploid cells does occur. However, the efficiency of disappearance of micronucleated cells is higher than for cells presenting chromosome non-disjunction. The correlation found between early apoptotic events and micronucleus formation could account, at least in part, for the specific elimination of aneuploid cells.

40|$|The {{search for}} {{micronuclei}} (MN) in binucleated cells {{is not always}} the best choice to recognize microtubule-perturbing agents, as they give rise to (micronucleated) mononucleated cells, mainly via mitotic slippage. We therefore treated peripheral lymphocytes with vincristine (VCR), nocodazole (NOC) and colcemid (COL) : (i) to quantify the formation of MN in mononucleated cells and the occurrence of abnormal mitoses (c-anaphases, endoreduplicated or tetraploid metaphases); (ii) to investigate the role of cytokinesis inhibition in determining or modulating the cytogenetic effects induced by the spindle poisons (we used either cytochalasin B (cyt B) or latrunculin A, a cytokinesis inhibitor that acts differently as compared with cyt B); (iii) to assess the ploidy of cells bearing MN by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis; and (iv) to evaluate the levels of the mitotic arrest deficient (MAD 2) protein, that blocks the cell at the metaphase-anaphase transition, by immunoblotting. We observed the induction of numerous abnormal mitoses and tetraploid interphase nuclei, as well as of MN in mononucleated cells, a high percentage of which had a diploid complement. We also found that the effects were generally not dose but chemical dependent, where NOC was proven to be more effective than COL and VCR in inducing overall MN formation and, specifically, diploid micronucleated lymphocytes. <b>Aneugens</b> damaged cells to a greater extent in the presence of cytokinesis inhibitors rather than in their absence. MAD 2 protein was expressed in controls to an extent reflecting the amount of lymphocytes which were initially in the G 2 /M transition phase. The same trend was seen in aneugen-treated cells where MAD 2 levels decreased with increasing spindle poison concentration. Here, we demonstrate that micronucleated mononucleated cells and aberrant mitoses can be considered useful markers of exposure to aneugens-like spindle poisons causing preferentially, but not exclusively, mitotic slippage. Assessment of MAD 2 levels can be used to confirm the cell-damaging activity of the compounds...|$|E
