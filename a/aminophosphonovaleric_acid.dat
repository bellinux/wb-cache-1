40|$|Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK) is an {{abundant}} neuropeptide of cerebral cortex but its function {{in this region}} is largely unknown. In this study we have examined the effect of glutamate receptor activation on the depolarisation-induced release of CCK-like immunoreactivity from tissue slices of rat cerebral cortex. The K+-evoked release of cholecystokinin {{was found to be}} significantly increased by the three excitatory amino acid agonists effective against glutamate receptor subtypes, N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA), kainic acid and quisqualate. The facilitation of CCK release by NMDA was examined in more detail and shown to be significantly attenuated by Mg 2 + (2. 5 mM), Zn 2 + (50 -mu-M), MK- 801 (0. 1 and 0. 3 -mu-M), <b>aminophosphonovaleric</b> <b>acid</b> (100 -mu-M) and kynurenic acid (100 -mu-M and 300 -mu-M). These results support the conclusion that release of CCK in cerebral cortex is modulated by the NMDA receptor...|$|E
40|$|The optic tecta of surgically {{produced}} three-eyed tadpoles were chronically {{exposed to}} the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist <b>aminophosphonovaleric</b> <b>acid</b> (APV), or to NMDA itself, to assess the influence of NMDA receptor/channels on the eye-specific segregation of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) terminals that occurs whenever two retinas innervate one tectal lobe. Exposure of the tectum to the active isomer of APV produces desegregation of the RGC terminals without blocking electrical activity in the afferents or altering their terminal arbor morphology. Exposure to the inactive isomer of APV causes no perturbation of the normal stripe pattern. APV-induced desegregation is completely reversible within 2 weeks of removal of the APV. In addition, exposure of the optic tectum to NMDA results in stripes with sharper borders and fewer forks and fusions than untreated animals. These {{results suggest that the}} NMDA receptor/channel plays a role in eye-specific segregation in the three-eyed tadpole...|$|E
40|$|Lead (Pb 2 +) {{exposure}} {{is known to}} affect presynaptic neurotransmitter release in both in vivo and cell culture models. However, the precise mechanism by which Pb 2 + impairs neurotransmitter release remains unknown. In the current study, we show that Pb 2 + exposure during synaptogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons produces the loss of synaptophysin (Syn) and synaptobrevin (Syb), two proteins involved in vesicular release. Pb 2 + exposure also {{increased the number of}} presynaptic contact sites. However, many of these putative presynaptic contact sites lack Soluble NSF attachment protein receptor complex proteins involved in vesicular exocytosis. Analysis of vesicular release using FM 1 - 43 dye confirmed that Pb 2 + exposure impaired vesicular release and reduced the number of fast-releasing sites. Because Pb 2 + is a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, we tested the hypothesis that NMDAR inhibition may be producing the presynaptic effects. We show that NMDAR inhibition by <b>aminophosphonovaleric</b> <b>acid</b> mimics the presynaptic effects of Pb 2 + exposure. NMDAR activity has been linked to the signaling of the transsynaptic neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and we observed that both the cellular expression of proBDNF and release of BDNF were decreased during the same period of Pb 2 + exposure. Furthermore, exogenous addition of BDNF rescued the presynaptic effects of Pb 2 +. We suggest that the presynaptic deficits resulting from Pb 2 + exposure during synaptogenesis are mediated by disruption of NMDAR-dependent BDNF signaling...|$|E
40|$|The {{induction}} of both {{long-term potentiation}} (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampal CA 1 region is {{triggered by the}} activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and the subsequent postsynaptic intracellular Ca 2 + increase. However, how NMDA receptor activation differs between LTP and LTD induction is unclear. In the present study, we examined the eff ects of the magnitude and duration of NMDA receptor activation on the induction of LTP and LTD. Partial blockage of NMDA receptors by a low concentration of <b>aminophosphonovaleric</b> <b>acid</b> (APV) (2 &# 956;M) prevented the induction of LTP, but not LTD. In contrast, {{a high concentration of}} APV(25 &# 956;M) blocked both LTP and LTD. Tetanus stimulation-induced LTP was impaired when hippocampal slices were given the tetanus stimulation for more than 5 min. Under partial blockage of NMDA receptors, the prolonged-tetanus stimulation induced LTD but not LTP. This phenomenon was mimicked by the application of glutamate to the slices. Finally, LTD induced by prolonged activation of NMDA receptors was not aff ected by inhibition of the desensitization of &# 945;-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 methylisoxazole- 4 -propionic acid (AMPA) receptors. These results suggest that critical diff erences exist between the induction of LTP and that of LTD in terms of both the magnitude and the duration of NMDA receptor activation. The duration of the increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration may be critical for determining whether LTP or LTD induction occurs. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of quinolones on electrically evoked pyramidal cell {{activity in the}} rat hippocampus in vitro was studied by using the slice technique. We hoped {{to learn more about}} the possible mechanisms for the development of side effects of different quinolones and to find a possible treatment. As reported earlier (W. Dimpfel, M. Spüler, A. Dalhoff, W. Hofmann, and G. Schlüter, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 35 : 1142 - 1146, 1991), the amplitude of the population spike increased in the presence of ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, or ofloxacin about twofold in comparison with reference values. This increase could be prevented in a concentration-dependent manner by the concomitant presence of 3 -amino- 1 -hydroxy- 2 -pyrrolidone (HA 966), a compound acting at the so-called glycine site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, but not in the presence of <b>aminophosphonovaleric</b> <b>acid</b> (APV), which acts at a different recognition site of the NMDA receptor. Another tool, 6, 7 -dinitroquinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione, an antagonist of the so-called AMPA receptor (named after the binding of L-alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid [AMPA] to this site), could not antagonize the effect induced by the quinolones. Activation of the glycine site of the NMDA receptor induced by the presence of D-serine in the superfusion medium also resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in the population spike amplitude. This response remained unchanged in the presence of ciprofloxacin, whereas lomefloxacin and ofloxacin led to further increases in the amplitude, especially in the presence of higher concentrations of D-serine. These results also point to an involvement of the glycine site of the central NMDA receptor in the development of side effects by different quinolones. A complete attenuation of the quinolone-induced effects was obtained in the presence of 2. 5 microM gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), a physiological neuromodulator which is marketed in some countries of Europe as a sedative. It is therefore concluded that the excitatory adverse effects of quinolones might be treated by the administration of GHB...|$|E
