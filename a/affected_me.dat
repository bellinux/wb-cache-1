5|$|Two events <b>affected</b> <b>me</b> most, {{one when}} a {{colleague}} dropped himself from second floor to escape under-covered police who stormed school. The second incident was when a dear teacher was arrested. That is when my voice started {{to rise and}} become annoying. I was caught vandalizing a school wall by writing apolitical human rights statements on school walls and was given the choice to either be submitted to police or to switch school. So I took {{the easy way out}} and since I was the top student back then, I choose to switch to Sheikh Abdul Aziz school.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really <b>affected</b> <b>me</b> as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E

500|$|Those encountering Alkan at {{this phase}} {{included}} the young Vincent d'Indy, who recalled Alkan's [...] "skinny, hooked fingers" [...] playing Bach on an Érard pedal piano: [...] "I listened, riveted {{to the spot}} by the expressive, crystal-clear playing." [...] Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: [...] "What happened to the great Beethovenian poem... I couldn't begin to describe– above all in the Arioso and the Fugue, where the melody, penetrating the mystery of Death itself, climbs up to a blaze of light, <b>affected</b> <b>me</b> with an excess of enthusiasm such as I have never experienced since. This was not Liszt—perhaps less perfect, technically—but it had greater intimacy and was more humanly moving..." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 2007, Sanz {{suffered}} a mental breakdown and took two months off {{in the middle of}} a world tour at the request of his doctor. The breakdown was caused by several events in his personal life, including the death of his father in 2005, his separation with Mexican model and actress Jaydy Mitchel, and his announcement that he had a three-year-old son outside of his marriage with Mitchel. He commented on the situation, saying [...] "You have to put things in perspective. It was stress, something that had never <b>affected</b> <b>me,</b> but this time, yes, it did. So I had to pay. A doctor told me to stop for a couple of months to recuperate completely." [...] Sanz spent time in therapy, a time which [...] "helped [...] a lot" [...] and gave him [...] "more power" [...] to perform.|$|E

500|$|When Lansbury was nine, {{her father}} died from stomach cancer; she retreated into playing {{characters}} as a coping mechanism. [...] In 2014, Lansbury described this event as [...] "the defining moment of my life. Nothing before or since has <b>affected</b> <b>me</b> so deeply." [...] Facing financial difficulty, her mother became engaged to a Scottish colonel, Leckie Forbes, and moved into his house in Hampstead, with Lansbury receiving an education at South Hampstead High School from 1934 until 1939. She nevertheless considered herself largely self-educated, learning from books, theatre and cinema. She became a self-professed [...] "complete movie maniac", visiting the cinema regularly and imagining herself as certain characters. Keen on playing the piano, she briefly studied music at the Ritman School of Dancing, and in 1940 began studying acting at the Webber Douglas School of Singing and Dramatic Art in Kensington, West London, first appearing onstage as a lady-in-waiting in the school's production of Maxwell Anderson's Mary of Scotland.|$|E
500|$|David Giler {{performed}} a rewrite; Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins, friends of Spielberg, suggested the plot device of a kidnapped child. Spielberg {{then began to}} write the script. The song [...] "When You Wish upon a Star" [...] from Pinocchio influenced Spielberg's writing style. [...] "I hung my story on the mood the song created, the way it <b>affected</b> <b>me</b> personally." [...] Jerry Belson and Spielberg wrote the shooting script together. In the end, Spielberg was given solo writing credit. During pre-production, the title was changed from Kingdom Come to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. J. Allen Hynek, who worked with the United States Air Force on Project Blue Book, {{was hired as a}} scientific consultant. Hynek felt [...] "even though the film is fiction, it's based for the most part on the known facts of the UFO mystery, and it certainly catches the flavor of the phenomenon. Spielberg was under enormous pressure to make another blockbuster after Jaws, but he decided to make a UFO movie. He put his career on the line." [...] USAF and NASA declined to cooperate on the film. In fact, NASA reportedly sent a 20-page letter to Spielberg, telling him that releasing the film was dangerous. In an interview, he said: [...] "I really found my faith when I heard that the Government was opposed to the film. If NASA took the time to write me a 20-page letter, then I knew there must be something happening." ...|$|E
500|$|Presley's rise to {{national}} attention in 1956 transformed {{the field of}} popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture. As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude. With its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by Presley—rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture. In this regard, Little Richard said of Presley, [...] "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He {{opened the door for}} black music." [...] Al Green agreed: [...] "He broke the ice for all of us." [...] President Jimmy Carter remarked on his legacy in 1977: [...] "His music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of American popular culture. His following was immense, and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality, rebelliousness, and good humor of his country." [...] Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: at the age of 21, within a year of his first appearance on American network television, {{he was one of the}} most famous people in the world. John Lennon stated that [...] "Before Elvis there was nothing." [...] Lennon also said that [...] "Nothing really <b>affected</b> <b>me</b> until I heard Elvis. If there hadn't been an Elvis, there wouldn't have been the Beatles." ...|$|E

500|$|Taare Zameen Par {{received}} several positive reviews. Subhash K. Jha {{suggests that the}} film is [...] "a work of art, a water painting where the colors drip into our hearts, which could easily have fallen into the motions of over-sentimentality. Aamir Khan holds back where he could easily resort to an extravagant display of drama and emotions." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN argued that the true power of the film lies in its [...] "remarkable, rooted, rock-solid script which provides the landscape for such an emotionally engaging, heart-warming experience." [...] Manish Gajjar from the BBC stated that the film [...] "touches your heart and moves you deeply with its sterling performances. [...] a film full of substance!" [...] Jaspreet Pandohar, also of BBC, posited that Taare Zameen Par is a [...] "far cry from the formulaic masala flicks churned out by the Bollywood machine," [...] and is [...] "an inspirational story that is as emotive as it is entertaining; {{this is a little}} twinkling star of a movie." [...] Furthermore, Aprajita Anil of Screen gave the film four stars and stated, [...] "Taare Zameen Par cannot be missed. Because it is different. Because it is delightful. Because it would make everyone think. Because it would help everyone grow. Because very rarely do performances get so gripping. And of course because the 'perfectionist' actor has shaped into a 'perfectionist' director." [...] In addition, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap stated that, [...] "Taare Zameen Par took me back to my hostel days. If you take away the dyslexia, it seems like my story. The film <b>affected</b> <b>me</b> so deeply that I was almost left speechless. After watching the film, I was asked how I liked Taare Zameen Par. I could not talk as I was deeply overwhelmed." ...|$|E

At this moment in time I prefer my children don't go to football matches. In the stands they have to listen to things that are difficult to explain to a child. It is better they aren't exposed to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parker was {{inspired}} to take up various creative endeavours at a young age, [...] "I used to draw a lot when I was very young, and I used {{to get the most}} immense feeling of satisfaction from finishing a picture and looking back at it, even though I wasn't actually that good. When I started playing music I got the same feeling from making a song, even if it was just a few noises or drum patterns put together. It was all about the buzz from making something from nothing. Music always <b>affected</b> <b>me</b> greatly as a listener anyway, usually from listening to music in my dad's car or listening to him play guitar." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{telephone}} incident had {{a generally}} {{negative impact on}} Crowe's public image, an example of negative public relations in the mass media, although Crowe had {{made a point of}} befriending Australian journalists in an effort to influence his image. A professional public image as [...] "The Gladiator" [...] had to compete alongside one as [...] "the telephone throwing actor". For example, the South Park episode, [...] "The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer" [...] revolves around a lampooning of his aggressive tendencies. Crowe commented on the ongoing media perpetuation in November 2010, five years into the process, during an interview with American television talk show host and journalist Charlie Rose: [...] "it <b>affected</b> <b>me</b> psychologically" [...] (...) [...] "it indelibly changed me." ...|$|E

Walker recalled that at 16 or 17 he was [...] "listening to a lot of old blues, more country style blues ... really <b>affected</b> <b>me,</b> just the rawness of it and the sincerity of it". Walker produced Stoneking's albums King Hokum (2005) and Jungle Blues (October 2008).

2500|$|Hunter's {{entry into}} the music {{business}} came after a chance encounter with Colin York and Colin Broom at a Butlin's Holiday Camp, where the trio won a talent competition performing [...] "Blue Moon" [...] on acoustic guitars. York and Broom were members of a Northampton-based band called The Apex Group, fronted by bass player and band leader Frank Short. Hunter soon left his home in Shrewsbury, transferred his apprenticeship from Sentinel/Rolls Royce to British Timken in Northampton, and joined The Apex Group on rhythm guitar. Hunter recalls jumping around like a lunatic on stage: [...] "Music <b>affected</b> <b>me</b> so much. The rest of them just stood there. It was funny, I had kids who came just to watch me do this, and I can't imagine what it looked like." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1921, he {{appeared}} again in opera as Don José in Carmen and as Lohengrin for Carl Rosa at Covent Garden, but thereafter devoted {{most of his}} efforts to concert performance. In 1921 he sang Gerontius at the memorial meeting for Gervase Elwes at the Royal Albert Hall with the Royal Choral Society. (He sang wonderfully, according to the Sunday Times, a courageous thing to do since {{in his own words}} he found the sudden death of Elwes in a train accident 'too shocking, too staggering to contemplate. It has <b>affected</b> <b>me</b> to the very depths of my nature ... it brought me to my knees.') From 1920 he began to specialise in song-recitals, of which he gave several each year, favouring all-English performances and championing English composers, but drawing from the repertoire of German and French songs also. In 1922 Roger Quilter, who had written much for Elwes and worked closely with him, dedicated his 'Morning song' (Thomas Heywood) to Coates, one of his most vibrant and characteristic miniatures, though Coates did not give the first performance of it.|$|E
