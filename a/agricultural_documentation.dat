Out of the 45 applications from 14 francophone countries, 19 participants were selected from Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Côte d'lvoire, Gabon, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Togo. The course instructors came from BIEF (Belgium), IPD/AOS (Burkina Faso), EBAD and ISADE (Senegal). The general objectives of this workshop were to develop national capabilities in training in agricultural information in Western and Central Africa, and through this improve the effectiveness of the documentation services. The main aim of the programme is to develop a core group of trainers able to organize training activities at local and national level. At the end of this course, the participants should be able to plan a training project; manage, organize and evaluate training sessions; apply the necessary training skills; and ensure technical support in <b>agricultural</b> <b>documentation.</b> After a brief update on information management skills, the participants were introduced to the adult training approach and were taught how to develop their training skills with the help of micro-teaching sessions. The course also included management and organizational aspects of training as well as the evaluation of a training project.

The programme is intended to improve the performance of the documentation centres in particular and, more generally, the institution itself. In practice, each benefiting centre chooses for itself the books which it judges will be of greatest value to its users. Between 1991 and 1994, 71 national centres of <b>agricultural</b> <b>documentation</b> and information were {{able to take advantage of}} the service and increase their stock of publications. (See also Spore 40, p 9) Following an evaluation of the DORA programme and a meeting of representatives from the benefiting centres, DORA has, since 1995, focused on agricultural educational institutions and now targets students, teachers, scientists and senior technicians in the agricultural sector. In the francophone ACP countries, 22 institutions have benefited from the service during 1995 - 96 (see box) and 44 centres in anglophone ACP countries will benefit from the programme between 1996 and 1998. Each site receives on average 300 reference books. Single copies will be provided of 70 % of the titles requested and up to a maximum of four copies each can be provided for the remaining 30 %. Postage, customs duty or transit costs are the responsibility of the beneficiary. The books can be of any type provided that they relate to agriculture, the only exclusions being encyclopaedias and subscriptions to, or photocopied extracts of, periodicals. Documentation officers in charge of the DORA sites receive a short training course and/or self-teaching materials and they have the opportunity to participate in meetings at which they can share their experiences with others in the programme. They also receive a number of supporting documents, in particular a handbook, details of how to make requests, a questionnaire for evaluating the service and promotional material (posters and brochures) for bringing the DORA service to the attention of users.

Its aims are to 'promote, encourage {{and support the}} efforts of its member states {{in order to achieve}} agricultural development and rural well-being. ' IICA was originally established as the Inter-American Institute of Agricultural Sciences which was founded in 1942. Fifty percent of its funding (US$ 50 million per annum) now comes from the annual quotas of member states; the remainder comes from multilateral banks and cooperation agencies, both public and private. Its main sphere of activity is with the governments of member states, particularly with ministries of agriculture, and is both diagnostic and advisory. It establishes links with networks or multinational projects in order to exchange information and set up collaborative programmes between member states and promotes technical cooperation projects. The five current programmes are: analysis and planning of agrarian policy; technological development and transfer; organization and administration for rural development; trade and agro-industry and livestock health. THE PRODUCTION AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION IICA has offices in each member country and these serve as a base for an active policy of information transfer. At its headquarters in Coronado (Costa Rica) is the Inter-American Centre for <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Documentation</b> and Information (ICADI). This centre has a communications department which offers training seminars on producing radio and TV programmes and written material. A team specializing in training strategies draws up teaching programmes. There are two main libraries, one in Coronado and one in Turrialba (Costa Rica) and a publications department which publishes IlCA's own technical books and reviews: Turrialba and IICA News (in French, English and Spanish). Some of the local offices have their own newsletters {{as in the case of}} Trinidad and Tobago, which publishes Caraphin News for the Caribbean Animal and Plant Health Network.

40|$|Librarians and {{trainers}} {{working together}} in Africa If {{everyone involved in}} agricultural development {{had access to the}} right information, at the right time and in the right place, many problems in this field could be resolved overnight. In an effort to get closer to this ideal, CTA and IFLA (International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions) brought together 15 reference librarians, agronomists, trainers and publishers based in anglophone Africa for a workshop from June 15 - 26, 1987 in Lilongwe, Malawi. This workshop was held to complement one for francophone participants (held in December 1986 in Dakar) and saw ten countries represented: Botswana, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia. The training team consisted of both ACP and European specialists in this field including S. Keena of IFD; W. Robert, J. Kinney, P. Wortley and M. Kinch. The major agricultural databases and principal suppliers of background information were represented by E. Lebowitz of AGRIS, J. Loder of CABI, K. Russel of the U. S. NAL, D. Hall of IFIS and D. Wood of the British Library Document Supply Centre. Identifying user needs This meeting not only enabled the participants to better appreciate analytical methodologies and identify user needs, but also increased their familiarity with primary and secondary information sources dealing with tropical agriculture. Emphasis was placed on the means of improving the publication, distribution and acquisition of documents as well as inter-library loans. The objective is to ensure the availability and accessibility of documentation through the supply of photocopies or microfilm. The potential of CD-ROM (Compact Disc - Read Only Memory; see Spore 9) was also covered. This new technology promises considerable advances for improving access to information. Furthermore, it appears to be quite appropriate for developing countries as it is sturdy, relatively inexpensive, easy to use and does not depend on unreliable telecommunication systems. The workshop also considered the role librarians can play as intermediaries between producers and consumers of information, an aspect which is unfortunately often underestimated. The approach taken by the workshop itself was to encourage the sharing of the practical experiences {{of the participants in the}} use of resources. The presentation of national reports and the ensuing discussion enabled the identification of a certain number of major problems that were subsequently treated in detail. This session had little in common with an academic course: the theoretical presentations were only used to introduce the practical work Concrete results Among other things, this part of the workshop dealt with the use of bibliographies, abstracts and directories. A concrete result was the compilation of several guides to inforrnation sources notably a 'List of agricultural periodicals in Africa', a 'Directory of research centres, universities and rural development departments in Africa' and a 'Bibliography of agricultural bibliographies dealing with Africa'. If the first two guides will remain as working documents, the third one will be developed further and jointly published by CTA and the International Federation for Documentation (IFD) in 1988. The value of this bibliographic directory is that it offers a synthesis of agricultural information relevant for use in Africa. Other practical results of the workshop included two project proposals. The first calls for the preparation of a bibliography on women and development in Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi and Zambia, and the second for the rehabilitation of the documentation resources of the Department of Agriculture in Ghana. Both of these projects may be funded by CTA or the FAO as a follow-up to this workshop. Exhaustive but productive Two field trips were organized for participants. The first one saw them visit the library of the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences at the University of Malawi (Bunda College) where they were briefed on a course erititled 'How to use documentation'. During the second visit, at the Department of Agricultural Research in Chitedze, they were given a demonstration on the use of micro-computers for literature searches, the development of local data bases, and access to international agricultural databases (notably CABI and AGRICOLA) with CDROM technology. Two aspects of this training proved to be particularly popular with participants: information retrieval from different sources (individuals, institutions and documents) and the collection of current <b>agricultural</b> <b>documentation</b> produced at the national level in order to stock a national agricultural library. According to the evaluation sheets, the workshop was exhaustive but highly productive. As a result of similarly positive reviews of the Dakar workshop, CTA intends to continue this kind of training activity. One is planned for 1988 in the Pacific region and another in 1989 for the Caribbean. A report on these activities, including an evaluation, is planned.

40|$|ABSTRACT. “Agricultural {{communications}} ” is {{an emerging}} field which is naturally both {{part of the}} “agriculture ” and “communications ” literature. However, it is much broader than just a subset of each. The coverage of standard databases such as CAB Abstracts and Communication Abstracts, while a good start, does not sufficiently cover the field. The <b>Agricultural</b> Communications <b>Documentation</b> Center (ACDC) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has, over the last quarter century, worked to help define and collect this literature, by identifying relevant documents and entering them into a Web-searchable Microsoft Access database. An analysis of this database reveals important clues concerning the literature of agricultural communications. Of the nearly 30, 000 documents within the ACDC collection, periodical articles comprise a little over one half, from a core list of 45 periodicals within the ACDC collection. More than one half of these core periodicals are outside the traditional agriculture and life science literature; approximately one third are scholarly journals...|$|R

Goats {{are a source of}} high-quality protein in both their milk and meat; they have a good fodder/protein conversion ratio; by-products such as cheese, suckling kids, mohair and cashmere are increasingly popular; and they can control brushwood and so reduce the risk of bush fires. The 'social' status of goats has risen accordingly, over-riding the social and religious taboos that were once associated with them. (See also Dossier this issue). However, knowledge of goat husbandry, nutrition and products has not kept up with {{the increase in the number}} of goats kept in the developing world. FAO's Goat Nutriton and Feeding working group and its goat sub-network have researched the subject for eight years, and Goat nutrition, a 308 page comprehensive handbook is the result.

The book is aimed at a wide readership of researchers, teachers, students and extension officers, decision-makers, veterinarians and livestock specialists and farmers.

40|$|Mr Djibril Sene, {{formerly}} Minister of Agriculture and of Research in Senegal, {{is currently}} President of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Senegalese parliament. He {{plays a major}} part {{on the international stage}} in agricultural policy formulation. We are throwing the baby out with the bathwater! Extension services which are the main link between research and the peasant farmer are under threat from swingeing cut-backs in national public service budgets. The 'Northern' countries and Asia have both witnessed spectacular advances in their agricultural development in their own, but very different, ways and time-scales. In each case the agricultural revolution went hand in hand with a significant improvement in the level of education of farmers. As a result, crop yields in those parts of the world have increased to the extent that famine is a thing of the past, and the markets are swamped with surpluses. This is due not only to improved techniques but also to the increased managerial and organizational skills of the farmers themselves. Not that increased agricultural production in the industrialized nations necessarily results in happiness for farmers; {{it is well known that}} agriculture there is in a state of crisis and that many farmers are being driven to bankruptcy. But even if Europe is now questioning its pattern of development, what cannot be seriously challenged is the crucial role played by information at every stage of the agricultural development process. The 'grey' revolution (that of mind and attitude), which happens only if ideas and technical knowledge can circulate freely, must go hand in hand with the 'green'. Access to scientific, technical and financial information is a fundamental prerequisite for progress. In the 1960 s and, to a lesser extent, in the 1970 s many African countries invested heavily in the training of field extension officers. These people formed the channel through which information flowed from the laboratory to the farm. Through them the on-going training of farmers facilitated the spread and use of what is nowadays known as STI (scientific and technical information). This was only possible when farmers had direct access to information sources through these officers. Despite the progress made at that time, sub-Saharan Africa still lags a long way behind in agricultural production and rural development. Rural development can be defined as the efficient and sustainable use of agricultural land; training and the professional, social and cultural education of the farmers. It is of necessity a long term task, whose ultimate objective is increased agricultural production. In Africa, however, opposing trends prevent this. The increase in population growth rates is the largest in the world and brings with it rapid urbanization, draining the most dynamic and productive people away from the countryside only to stagnate in shanty towns on the periphery of the cities, looking for non-existent employment. The result of this is that the desired increase in agricultural production, especially of food crops, relies on a work force of rapidly diminishing size and motivation. The challenge can be met only by policies which bring about training and largescale advances in the use of technical skills. Unfortunately, the policies of structural adjustment, which various African states are forced to adopt, have sounded the death knell for the training of personnel who had real links with the farmer. These state cut-backs are having a disastrous effect on agricultural extension services and this in turn has a knock on effect, hitting farming hard. Public service cuts do not just get rid of the dead wood, they destroy the very fabric of the system and the adjustments which will have to be made as a result of these drastic cuts will take time. As a result, we have to think of new forms of education and training which rely more on audio-visual methods of disseminating agricultural STI. The current educational level of the small farmer is such that any agricultural information intended for his use must be within his scope, so that he can understand it and benefit from it. If information is going to be put across in simple language, there is a need for people who are themselves close to the land and who can assimilate the material and communicate it in ways appropriate to the farmers. These rural communicators must have been trained in audio-visual techniques and must be able to access the information, which must be gathered and stored accessibly in well-equipped national <b>agricultural</b> <b>documentation</b> centres, which are themselves linked to regional or international centres. The link between peasant farmers and research institutes will have to be forged anew, and we have yet to think of different ways of doing this. The practical difficulties will have to be addressed realistically. We must come up with a strategy which helps the rural producer in his village to obtain access to information and to interpret it so that he himself becomes an agent of progress towards food security to which we must all aspire. The views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CTA.

40|$|Many {{demands on}} dwindling {{resources}} have left libraries and documentation centres sliding down to {{somewhere near the}} bottom of the priority list for national funding, but can agricultural and rural development take place without a reliable basis of information from which to move forward? How can ACP countries develop their own capacities to access and deliver agricultural information for development? The Fourth ACP-EU Lomé Convention confers responsibility on CTA not only to improve the availability of scientific and technical information on agriculture to ACP States, but also to promote the capacity of ACP States for the production, purchase and exchange of this kind of information. CTA has now given every ACP country in Africa the opportunity to prepare a national monograph assessing its own agricultural information needs. Four regional workshops have been held to give participants a forum to discuss how the institutions within their countries can take advantage of the opportunities that a regional approach can offer for solving the challenge of insufficient funding, inadequate equipment, lack of trained staff and poor recognition by policy makers of the essential role that information plays in agricultural development. As Dr Amos Thapisa from the University of Botswana declared at the last of the regional workshops which was held in Windhoek, Namibia, 14 - 18 November 1994, 'We need to share information about agriculture, the thing that really feeds SADC; and I think information also can operate at that level - it feeds nations. ' This fourth regional workshop concerned the southern African countries which are members of the ACP Group and was attended by participants from Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe and by representatives of regional and international organizations. CTA sponsored the workshop, which was organized jointly by CTA, SACCAR (Southern African Centre for Cooperation in Agricultural Research) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Rural Development of Namibia. In presenting CTA's purpose in sponsoring the workshop Alan Jackson, Technical Adviser, emphasized that CTA has no wish to foster the establishment of a monolithic information system. The aim was to enhance the awareness at the highest political level of the relationship between the availability of technical information and the development of the agricultural sector which is of such importance to Africa. Furthermore, the benefits that can be derived from a regional approach to solving common problems should not be underestimated. Such an approach makes more efficient use of limited resources within the countries concerned and this, in the longer term, will lead to self-sufficiency and hence better sustainability. Potential donors are also in favour of regionalization because their limited sources of funding can be used more effectively. CTA has been working closely with SACCAR and anticipates continuing close links as SACCAR already provides a regional structure as part of SADC. Participants also endorsed the concept of SAAINET as a network where a focal point in each country serves as a link to national users, to SACCAR and to other countries in the region. It was recommended that a regional steering committee be set up in support of SAAINET (the Southern African Agricultural Information Network) to increase its effectiveness. A summary report of the workshop, which includes details of the conclusions and recommendations,will soon be available from CTA. The benefits of regionalization are well understood but, as Matseliso Moshoeshoe-Chadzingwa from the Institute of Southern African Studies at the National University of Lesotho pointed out, 'There can never be regional cooperation without national cooperation'. Weak or, in some cases, non-existent national agricultural information policies have left fragmented services with individual libraries, and their users, unclear as to who is providing what and where and whether it is provided at all. 'In soccer there is teamwork,' said Peter Masunu from Zambia's Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries. 'Even though you are passing the ball to other players you are all aiming for a score,' he added. 'Information centres collect information and pass it to their users but the idea of it all is to develop the agricultural industry and help the farmer upgrade his standard of living. We are all players in this whole game'' he continued. Wenke Adam, Librarian at the Centre for <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Documentation</b> in Mozambique, said that a vicious circle had been created because when libraries are poor they are not supported and therefore deteriorate still further. But the vicious circle can be broken in three places, she claimed. 'It can be broken by researchers who must protest at the level where something can be done about it. It can be broken by decision makers who must understand that this is an area where they have to invest. In other words, you cannot get decent documentation services for free. And it can be broken by librarians themselves who must do as much as they can with what they have in order to show that they are worth supporting. ' It was clear from discussions that librarians and documentalists are keen to take a more pro-active role in providing the best service possible to their users. They can do so if their users take them into their confidence at the earliest opportunity and work with them in order to get the information they need. As Etta Coetzee, Technical Information Officer at the Namibia Development Corporation emphasized, 'If you have a user in front of you, it's not just anybody. It's that specific person with a specific need. And if you can satisfy that need you have done a good job'regional workshops which was held in Windhoek, Namibia, 14 - 18 November 199...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the factors}} {{limiting}} agricultural development in ACP countries is the difficult access to information on research activities and development experiences. The identification of such information sources constitutes the first step towards {{a better understanding of}} agricultural sciences and techniques. Since CTA's prime objective is to facilitate access to agricultural information in ACP countries, it has undertaken the publication of a series of directories on information sources in the field of agriculture and rural development. The first directory dealt with information sources on tropical agriculture in EEC countries. The second which has just been published in English and French, deals with agricultural information sources in ACP countries. Produced with the cooperation of CAB-lnternational in the UK and the International Documentation Centre for Agriculture in Hot Regions (CIDARC) in France, it fulfills two objectives. First, it is a guide for researchers, trainers, extension workers, planners and documentalists engaged in information searches. Second, it helps to promote information exchanges among different ACP countries and between them and EEC countries. It can also help decision-makers to plan their national policies. This directory includes 337 agricultural information services (libraries, documentation centres, bibliographic databases and documentation networks), research institutes, teaching establishments and development organizations in ACP countries. It deals with all agricultural sectors: agronomic research, teaching and extension work, rural sociology and economics, animal and vegetable production, forestry, aquatic sciences and fishing, agricultural equipment, natural resources, food and nutrition sciences and the environment (a classification of these information services by field is given in Table 1). Apart from the directory itself, which is classified by country in alphabetical order, this publication includes an index of the main fields covered by each centre and a list of acronyms. Each entry includes the name of the information service followed by that of its parent organization, its address, date of establishment, and the name and title of the person to contact in addition to the staff numbers. It specifies the field of interest of the centre, its geographical coverage, its documentation resources, its users, the goods and services that it provides, its budget and its documentation cooperation service. The index was inspired primarily by that used by AGROVOC, the multilingual thesaurus of agricultural terminology and the categories used by AGRIS. The detailed analysis of the data contained in this directory reveals the current situation of <b>agricultural</b> <b>documentation</b> in ACP countries. It shows that the first agricultural information services date from the last century. The Jamaican Ministry of Agriculture created its national agricultural library in 1876. Since the 1920 s, the number of such centres has increased rapidly. At the current rate, one can hope to see more than 500 agricultural information sources in ACP countries by the year 2000 A geographical breakdown of this data reveals a strong development in West Africa which hosts more than 36 % of the agricultural information services of ACP countries (see Table 3). Documentation centres appear to be concentrated mainly in the capitals to the detriment of rural areas which would make much-later use of such information. These centres offer traditional services: providing bibliographic searches, summary reviews, lists of documents received, and catalogues of publications and periodicals as well as services for selected diffusion of information and for bibliographic searches. However, the summaries and progress reports receive relatively little attention {{despite the fact that they}} are highly regarded by 'information consumers'. The same is the case for the services of consolidation, evaluation and updating of information. It is true that researchers, teachers and students, who are the main users of these information services, are capable of doing such summaries and analyses themselves. Nevertheless, the demand for summarized information remains high. The dearth of such material is due in part to the lack of competent staff The collections of these information services are, generally speaking, relatively modest. Some centres, however, do have significant documentation resources. On average, each one contains 3217 books, 1534 reports, 375 publications of the parent organization 169 periodical titles and 495 microfiches. As far as equipment is concerned even though ACP countries are the least computerized, it is reassuring to learn that nearly a third of the information services have microcomputers although of many different brands. This diversity of equipment, which also applies to software, is no doubt a result of supply and demand but it creates problems of compatability which makes it difficult to exchange data needed for documentary cooperation. An analysis of such data also reveals that there is a greater reproduction capacity than previously thought. If only 7. 4 % of the information services have their own microfilm reproduction workshops, 55 % of the centres have microfilm or microfiche readers. Finally, the most significant phenomenon in the development of information services in ACP countries over the last decade has been the emergence of documentation networks and the exchange of information and experiences. All of the synergies and economies of scale have been exploited: interlibrary loans development of collective catalogues for periodicals and reference works, standardization of working methods, and promotion of the exploitation of their documentation capital. National sectoral networks have emerged in the Congo (REDICA), Cote d'lvoire (REDACT) and Senegal (REDAS). At regional level, the approach taken has been the establishment of a network reflecting the major socioeconomic and geopolitical concerns. One notes the presence of PADIS, oriented towards socioeconomic development in Africa of POPIN-AFRICA oriented towards the population problems of this continent, and RESADOC in Mali which is primarily concerned with problems related to drought, desertification and environmental protection. At the international level, AGRIS and CARIS remain the main global information systems. The establishment of these networks, no matter what their level, in conjunction with the use of computerized facilities, clearly shows the vitality of the documentation supply in ACP countries. It is certain, however, that these structures remain fragile and do not get sufficient attention or support. A new item must be added to the priorities of these centres: the analysis of agricultural information to provide products that respond better to the real needs of users for summarized documents. In this field, as in many others, the availability of human resources will be the determining factor. For more details, contact: Thiendou Niang.

50|$|The Agriculture Network Information Collaborative (AgNIC) {{alliance}} {{was formed}} in 1995 {{by a group of}} four land grant institutions - Cornell University, Iowa State University, University of Arizona, and University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Library (NAL). In 1998, NAL assumed the role as “secretariat” to move the partnership forward. Members were committed to creating a voluntary “alliance” dedicated to providing Internet access to quality, authoritative agricultural information, and specialized reference services. In 2007, with 60 voluntary partners, this vision continues to sustain the Alliance, largely due to its collaborative nature. University libraries affiliated with land-grant colleges—as well as other interested institutions, such as the International Rice Research Institute, the American Farmland Trust, the <b>Agricultural</b> Information and <b>Documentation</b> Service for America (SIDALC) and the University of Buenos Aires, School of Agriculture, Central Library, are working together with NAL to develop the AgNIC Alliance, its collections and services, and the technologies upon which it relies.|$|R
40|$|The {{books and}} {{journals}} in most ACP {{information and documentation}} centres tend to be old and out-of-date. This {{is the result of}} several factors: lack of funds; the high cost of imported scientific books; lack of information on recent titles; shortage of trained library staff; and convertible currency to purchase library books and subscriptions. Although some development agencies do help in the purchase of publications, this is not sufficient. This sort of support is often sporadic, and, in the case of book donations, not always appropriate {{to the needs of the}} recipients. To overcome this, CTA launched a project to help ACP <b>agricultural</b> information and <b>documentation</b> centres. The project is known as DORA (distribution of reference books on agriculture). Through this project CTA supplies a maximum of 500 reference works to 20 ACP centres each year. The target is that by 1995 all the ACP countries will have been served. The publications to be supplied are selected by the beneficiary centres themselves, which is a distinguising feature of the project. The centres are encouraged to consult the users in selecting the publications and to read not just the lists sent by CTA, but bibliographies and catalogues from publishers and specialized institutions. The choice of beneficiary centres is made using a number of criteria: whether a centre has requested assistance; how well it is likely to handle and manage the books it receives and promote their use; whether there is another centre within the same country which is already receiving help from CTA or a similar source. In 1991 20 centres from 19 ACP countries benefited from the DORA project. In 1992 the following countries will have received help: Angola, Belize, Botswana, Cameroon, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Uganda, Papua New Guinea, Western Samoa, Sierra Leone, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Swaziland and Tonga. CTA hopes that the project will help those concerned with development to use local libraries, which DORA has stocked, in their search for solutions tailored to the problems they encounter.

40|$|As part of {{its mission}} to train the {{agricultural}} information services of the ACP states, CTA organizes introductory courses in documentary microcomputing. These courses consist of two stages: firstly; {{an introduction to the}} basics of microcomputing, and secondly, practice in the use of agricultural databases. Between the two stages each participant works individually on a project relevant to his or her particular needs, using the skills and knowledge acquired in stage one. The main aim of these courses is to give <b>agricultural</b> information and <b>documentation</b> staff a basic knowledge of documentary computing, sufficient for them to master the essentials of computerized documentation, so that they can use, and add to, agricultural databases. The course programme includes an initiation into basic microcomputing, training in the MS/DOS system, general teaching on the potential uses of documentary software and its practical application in compiling agricultural databases using simple software. It also includes an introduction to reference formats and their usage both inhouse and as part of computer-linked networks, and practical training in TEXTO and micro CDS/ISIS softwares. The individual projects, completed between the two stages of the course, represent a new departure in the training of professionals in the field of agricultural information. Springing from the first stage as they do, the projects help in the selection process for the second stage. By means of practical work they provide an opportunity for indepth study and use of the skills and knowledge gained in stage one. They also take into account the participants' personal needs and experience acquired from his own workplace. The subject matter of these projects includes bibliographical databases, lists of information sources, scientists and researchers, and factual databanks. The second innovative aspect of these courses is that the provision of technical documentation is both the tool used to raise the standard of the participants to the desired level and the basis from which to continue with the training themselves back home, thereby helping them to consolidate the skills they have acquired. The first-level courses were held last year in Bordeaux (France) {{with the help of the}} Ecole Internationale for the French-speakers and at Lilongwe, Malawi, for the English speakers in conjunction with SACCAR and the University of Botswana. The secondlevel courses will be held during the second half of 1991 in Senegal and Botswana.
