25|$|An {{important}} anatomic {{landmark in}} <b>anal</b> <b>cancer</b> is the pectinate line (dentate line), {{which is located}} about 1–2cm from the anal verge (where the anal mucosa of the anal canal becomes skin). Anal cancers located above this line (towards the head) {{are more likely to}} be carcinomas, whilst those located below (towards the feet) {{are more likely to be}} squamous cell carcinomas that may ulcerate. <b>Anal</b> <b>cancer</b> is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis and the sexually transmissible infections HPV and HIV. <b>Anal</b> <b>cancer</b> may be a cause of constipation or tenesmus, or may be felt as a palpable mass, although it may occasionally present as an ulcerative form.|$|E

25|$|<b>Anal</b> <b>cancer</b> is {{investigated}} by biopsy {{and may be}} treated by excision and radiotherapy, or with external beam radiotherapy and adjunctive chemotherapy. The five-year survival rate with the latter procedure is above 70%.|$|E
50|$|HPV type 16 is {{the most}} {{malignant}} strain, present in 41 to 54% of all cervical cancers, {{and in many cases}} of vaginal/vulvar <b>cancer,</b> penile <b>cancers,</b> <b>anal</b> <b>cancers,</b> and cancers of the head and neck.|$|R
50|$|Both men {{and women}} are {{carriers}} of HPV. The Gardasil vaccine also protects men against <b>anal</b> <b>cancers</b> and warts and genital warts.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>anal</b> <b>cancers</b> are {{squamous}} cell carcinomas (epidermoid carcinomas), that arises near the squamocolumnar junction. It may be keratinizing (basaloid) or non-keratinizing (cloacogenic).|$|R
25|$|Genital human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{is a common}} virus that most sexually active people in the U.S. will have {{at some time in}} their lives. It is passed on through genital contact and is also found on areas that condoms do not cover. Most men who get HPV of any type never develop any symptoms or health problems. Some types of HPV can cause genital warts, penile cancer, or <b>anal</b> <b>cancer.</b> MSM and men with compromised immune systems are more likely than other men to develop <b>anal</b> <b>cancer.</b> Men with HIV {{are also more likely to}} get severe cases of genital warts that are hard to treat.|$|E
25|$|The lower bowel may {{be treated}} {{directly}} with radiation (treatment of rectal or <b>anal</b> <b>cancer)</b> or be exposed by radiation therapy to other pelvic structures (prostate, bladder, female genital tract). Typical symptoms are soreness, diarrhoea, and nausea.|$|E
25|$|In males, Gardasil {{may reduce}} {{their risk of}} genital warts and precancerous lesions caused by HPV. This {{reduction}} in precancerous lesions might be predicted to reduce the rates of penile and <b>anal</b> <b>cancer</b> in men. Since penile and anal cancers are much less common than cervical cancer, HPV vaccination of young men {{is likely to be}} much less cost-effective than for young women.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of a result of {{clinical}} experience with the treatment for patients with <b>anal</b> canal <b>cancer,</b> a clinicopathological study of <b>anal</b> canal <b>cancer</b> was performed in comparison with that of colon <b>cancer.</b> <b>Anal</b> canal <b>cancer</b> has a complex histologic types and a tendency toward deep invasion outside the adventitia when compared with colon cancer. Therefore, nodal involvement was in proportion to the depth of cancer infiltration. As a result, the survival time had become worst in patients with Dukes C of <b>anal</b> canal <b>cancer.</b> The <b>anal</b> canal has been defined that as a canal from the level of the attachment of puborectal muscle to the anal verge. It is mainly covered with smooth striated squamous epithelia except for the upper portion which is covered with specialized columnar epithelia, lasting to the rectal epithelium. The structure of the anal canal is complex with the composition of ecto-and endodermal tissues. <b>Anal</b> canal <b>cancer</b> is particular in gross appearance, histologic types and the modes of cancer extension in comparison with rectal cancer.

30|$|The {{established}} {{association with}} HPV infection and premalignant intra-epithelial dysplastic changes provides {{insight into the}} pathogenesis of HIV- and IBD-related <b>anal</b> <b>cancers,</b> {{and the possibility of}} prevention or early diagnosis through screening of high-risk individuals [1, 2].|$|R
25|$|Human {{papilloma}} virus (HPV) vaccines are vaccines {{that prevent}} infection by {{certain types of}} human papillomavirus. Available vaccines protect against either two, four, or nine types of HPV. All vaccines protect against at least HPV type 16 and 18 that cause the greatest risk of cervical cancer. It is estimated that they may prevent 70% of cervical cancer, 80% of <b>anal</b> <b>cancer,</b> 60% of vaginal cancer, 40% of vulvar cancer, and possibly some mouth cancer. They additionally prevent some genital warts with the vaccines against 4 and 9 HPV types providing greater protection.|$|E
25|$|Gardasil {{has been}} shown to also be {{effective}} in preventing genital warts in males. On 9 September 2009, an advisory panel recommended that the FDA licence Gardasil in the United States for boys and men ages 9–26 for the prevention of genital warts. Soon after that, the vaccine was approved by the FDA for use in males aged 9 to 26 for prevention of genital warts and <b>anal</b> <b>cancer.</b> While Gardasil and Gardasil-9 vaccines have been approved for males, the third HPV vaccine, Cervarix, is not administered to males. Unlike the Gardasil-based vaccines, Cervarix does not protect against genital warts.|$|E
25|$|Fawcett was {{diagnosed}} with <b>anal</b> <b>cancer</b> in 2006 and began treatment that included chemotherapy and surgery. Four months later, on her 60th birthday, the Associated Press reported that Fawcett {{was at that point}} cancer-free. However, in May 2007, Fawcett experienced a recurrence and {{was diagnosed}} with stage IV cancer that had metastasized to her liver (which has a 5-year survival rate of <20%); a malignant polyp was found where she had been treated for the initial cancer. Doctors contemplated whether to implant a radiation seeder (which differs from conventional radiation and is used to treat other types of cancer). Fawcett's U.S. doctors told her that she would require a colostomy.|$|E
40|$|The FHIT gene, {{a member}} of the {{histidine}} triad gene family, is a tumor suppressor gene exhibiting deletions in the majority of human cancers. Aberrant transcripts of this gene have been found in about 50 % of esophageal, stomach and colon carcinomas. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in malignant transformation of the lining cells of the anus. In this study FHIT gene expression was investigated in this particular kind of human cancer. FHIT expression was comparatively analyzed at the mRNA level, by RT-PCR, in squamous <b>anal</b> <b>cancers,</b> normal <b>anal</b> tissue and peripheral blood samples. cDNA analyses showed variability in FHIT transcripts, without apparent effects on the predicted amino acid sequence. These different FHIT mRNAs could represent transcripts from an alternative splicing event. Our data indicate that the FHIT mRNA detected in <b>anal</b> <b>cancers</b> and in normal samples is heterogeneous. Immunohistochemical data suggest that the Fhit protein is expressed only in a fraction of the tumor cells, while it is strongly expressed in the epithelial cells of glands of the normal anal mucosa. The absence or poor expression of the Fhit protein in <b>anal</b> <b>cancers</b> suggests a role for this tumor suppressor gene product, as a risk factor, in the onset of this human cancer, as reported before for other human gastrointestinal tumors...|$|R

40|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) causes {{most cases}} of <b>anal</b> <b>cancers.</b> In this study, we analyzed biopsy material from 112 patients with <b>anal</b> <b>cancers</b> in Australia {{for the presence}} of HPV DNA by the INNO LiPA HPV genotyping assay. There were 82 % (92) males and 18 % (20) females. The mean age at diagnosis was significantly (p = 0. 006) younger for males (52. 5 years) than females (66 years). HIV-infected males were diagnosed at a much earlier mean age (48. 2 years) than HIV negative (56. 3 years) males (p = 0. 05). HPV DNA was detected in 96. 4 % (108) of cases. HPV type 16 was the commonest, at 75 % (81) of samples and being the sole genotype detected in 61 % (66). Overall, 79 % (85) of cases had at least one genotype targeted by the bivalent HPV (bHPV) vaccine, 90 % (97) by the quadrivalent HPV (qHPV) vaccine and 96 % (104) by the nonavalent HPV (nHPV) vaccine. The qHPV vaccine, which is now offered to all secondary school students in Australia, may prevent <b>anal</b> <b>cancers</b> in Australia. However, given the mean age of onset of this condition, the vaccine is unlikely to have a significant impact for several decades. Further research is necessary to prove additional protective effects of the nHPV vaccine...|$|R
2500|$|Most {{cases of}} <b>anal</b> <b>cancer</b> {{are related to}} {{infection}} with the human papilloma virus (HPV). Anal sex alone does not cause anal cancer; the risk of <b>anal</b> <b>cancer</b> through anal sex is attributed to HPV infection, which is often contracted through unprotected anal sex. <b>Anal</b> <b>cancer</b> is relatively rare, and significantly less common than {{cancer of the colon}} or rectum (colorectal cancer); the American Cancer Society states that it affects approximately 7,060 people (4,430 in women and 2,630 in men) and results in approximately 880 deaths (550 in women and 330 in men) in the United States, and that, though <b>anal</b> <b>cancer</b> has been on the rise for many years, it is mainly diagnosed in adults, [...] "with an average age being in the early 60s" [...] and it [...] "affects women somewhat more often than men."

2500|$|Diseases {{affecting}} the rectum and anus are extremely common, especially in older adults. [...] Hemorrhoids, vascular outpouchings of skin, are very common, as is pruritus ani, referring to anal itchiness. Other conditions, such as <b>anal</b> <b>cancer</b> {{may be associated}} with ulcerative colitis or with sexually transmitted infections such as HIV. [...] Inflammation of the rectum is known as proctitis, one cause of which is radiation damage associated with radiotherapy to other sites such as the prostate. Faecal incontinence can result from mechanical and neurological problems, and when associated with a lack of voluntary voiding ability is described as encopresis. Pain on passing stool may result from anal abscesses, small inflamed nodules, anal fissures, and anal fistulas.|$|E
2500|$|HPV types 6 and 11 {{are most}} {{frequently}} the cause of genital warts. It is spread through direct skin-to-skin contact, usually during oral, genital, or anal sex with an infected partner.

2500|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish the radiosensitivity of a particular tumor, which to some extent is a laboratory measure, from the radiation [...] "curability" [...] of a cancer in actual clinical practice. For example, leukemias are not generally curable with radiation therapy, because they are disseminated through the body. Lymphoma may be radically curable if it is localised to one area of the body. Similarly, many of the common, moderately radioresponsive tumors are routinely treated with curative doses of radiation therapy if they are at an early stage. For example: non-melanoma skin cancer, head and neck cancer, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer, <b>anal</b> <b>cancer,</b> prostate cancer. Metastatic cancers are generally incurable with radiation therapy {{because it is not}} possible to treat the whole body.|$|E
2500|$|The {{functioning}} of the anal canal can be damaged, traumatically or atraumatically. The resting tone of the anal canal {{is not the only}} factor which is important, both the length of the high pressure zone and its radial translation of force are required for continence. This means that even with normal anal canal pressure, focal defects such as the keyhole deformity can be the cause of substantial symptoms. External anal sphincter (EAS) dysfunction is associated with impaired voluntary control, whereas internal anal sphincter (IAS) dysfunction is associated with impaired fine tuning of fecal control. Lesions which mechanically interfere with, or prevent the complete closure of the anal canal can cause a liquid stool or mucous rectal discharge. Such lesions include piles (inflamed hemorrhoids), anal fissures, <b>anal</b> <b>cancer</b> or fistulae. Obstetric injury may tear the anal sphincters, and some of these injuries may be occult (undetected). The risk of injury is greatest when labor has been especially difficult or prolonged, when forceps are used, with higher birth weights or when an midline episiotomy is performed. Only when there is post operative investigation of FI such as endoanal ultrasound is the injury discovered. FI is a much under-reported complication of surgery. The IAS is easily damaged with an anal retractor (especially the Park's anal retractor), leading to reduced resting pressure postoperatively. Since the hemorrhoidal vascular cushions contribute 15% of the resting anal tone, surgeries involving these structures may affect continence status. Partial internal sphincterotomy, fistulotomy, anal stretch (Lord's operation), hemorrhoidectomy or transanal advancement flaps may all lead to FI post operatively, with soiling being far more common than solid FI. The [...] "keyhole deformity" [...] refers to scarring within the anal canal and is another cause of mucus leakage and minor incontinence. This defect is also described as a groove in the anal canal wall, and may occur after posterior midline fissurectomy or fistulotomy, or with lateral IAS defects. Rare causes of traumatic injury to the anal sphincters include military or traffic accidents complicated by pelvic fractures, spine injuries or perineal lacerations, insertion of foreign bodies in the rectum, and sexual abuse. [...] Nontraumatic conditions causing anal sphincter weakness include scleroderma, damage to the pudendal nerves and IAS degeneration of unknown cause. Radiation induced FI may involve the anal canal as well as the rectum, when proctitis, anal fistula formation and diminished function of internal and external sphincter occur. Irradiation may occur during radiotherapy, e.g. for prostate cancer.|$|E
