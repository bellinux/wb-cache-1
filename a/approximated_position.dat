5000|$|On {{the night}} of 6/7 June, Captain Rubén Teófilo Figueroas 3rd Assault Section {{attacked}} the British patrol base near Murrell Bridge, northwest of Stanley, which was manned by Sergeant Ian Addles patrol from Captain Matthew Selfridges D Company of the 3rd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment, at the <b>approximated</b> <b>position</b> [...] After a gun-battle lasting some 40 minutes, the British abandoned the outpost under heavy mortar fire, leaving behind much of their equipment. The outcome of this engagement compelled the British to set patrol bases closer to their own lines.|$|E
5000|$|After being {{informed}} that Japanese forces were approaching and that further towing efforts were unfeasible, Admiral Halsey ordered the Hornet sunk. While {{the rest of}} the U.S. warships retired towards the southeast to get out of range of Kondos and Abes oncoming fleet, destroyers [...] and [...] attempted to scuttle Hornet with multiple torpedoes and over 400 shells, but she still remained afloat. With advancing Japanese naval forces only 20 minutes away, the two U.S. destroyers abandoned Hornets burning hulk at 20:40. By 22:20, the rest of Kondos and Abes warships had arrived at Hornets location. The destroyers [...] and [...] then finished Hornet with four 24 in torpedoes. At 01:35 on 27 October 1942, she finally sank on the <b>approximated</b> <b>position</b> [...] Several night attacks by radar-equipped Catalinas on Junyō and Teruzuki, knowledge of the head start the U.S. warships had in their retreat from the area, plus a critical fuel situation apparently caused the Japanese to reconsider further pursuit of the U.S. warships. After refueling near the northern Solomon Islands, the ships returned to their main base at Truk on 30 October.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{report the}} results of time-resolved {{photometric}} and spectroscopic near-infrared observations of the Ofpe/WN 9 star and LBV candidate GCIRS 34 W in the Galactic Centre star cluster. Diffraction limited resolution photometric observations obtained in H and K bands show a strong, non-periodic variability on time scales from months to years in both bands accompanied by variations of the stellar colour. Three K band spectra obtained in 1996, 2003 and 2004 with integral field spectrometers are identical within their accuracies and exclude significant spectroscopic variability. The most probable explanation of the stellar photometric variability is obscuration by circumstellar material ejected by the star. The <b>approximated</b> <b>position</b> of GCIRS 34 W in a HR diagram is located between O supergiants and LBVs, suggesting that this star is a transitional object between these two phases of stellar evolution...|$|E

40|$|A novel four-layered depth-of-interaction (DOI) {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET) scanner is being developed at National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Japan. It aims to improve the image resolution, particularly {{at the edge of}} field of view while maintaining high sensitivity. However, inter-crystal scatter (ICS) occurs in the detector blocks of the jPET-D 4. It is a phenomenon where there are multiple scintillations for a single irradiation of gamma photon due to Compton scatter in detecting crystals. Because of the Anger-type logic calculation, only one <b>approximated</b> <b>position</b> is detected by the jPET-D 4 in the case of ICS. This causes error in position detection and ICS worsens the image contrast, particularly for smaller hotspot. In this paper, we propose to model an ICS probability by utilizing a Monte-Carlo simulator. It is a statistical relationship between gamma-ray first interaction crystal pair and the detected crystal pair. The ICS probability is then used to improve the system matrix of statistical image reconstruction algorithm ML-EM in order to correct the error of ICS. We have shown in computer simulation that image contrast is recovered successfully by applying the proposed method...|$|E
