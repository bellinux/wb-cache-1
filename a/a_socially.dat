5|$|The {{day after}} Cleave's article {{appeared}} in the Evening Standard, Beatles press officer Tony Barrow offered Datebook, a US teen magazine, rights to all four interviews. Barrow believed the pieces were important to show fans that the Beatles were progressing beyond simple pop music and producing more intellectually challenging work. As Datebook was <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> progressive magazine that addressed subjects such as interracial dating and legalization of marijuana, {{it seemed like a}} suitable vehicle to carry this information.|$|E
5|$|The name Fefa {{was removed}} after this storm and {{replaced}} with Felicia in the 1997 season. The reason for the name retirement is unknown, as the storm itself caused little damage. Possible reasons listed {{for the removal of}} the name are pronunciation ambiguity, <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> unacceptable meaning in another language, or because the storm name represented a significant human disaster.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{black-throated blue warbler}} is <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> monogamous species, {{males are}} {{frequently}} observed in territories of other males, suggesting the occurrence of extra-pair matings. Nestling parentage is identified by microsatellites in a study plot at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The results show that extra-pair fertilization occurs and {{that the majority of}} the extra-pair sires come from males in neighboring territories. Only very few extra-pair sires are from distant territories. This local reproductive interaction is also supported by another study conducted earlier, which finds that extra pair fertilizations are strongly and positively correlated with local synchrony but there is no significant association with population level synchrony.|$|E
5|$|In {{all human}} {{cultures}} premastication/kiss-feeding or kissing {{between mother and}} infant has been observed in all with kissing believed to be <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> ritualized form of feeding premasticated food. There is high similarity in the execution of kiss-feeding and human kisses (e.g. French kiss); in the former, the tongue is used to push food from mother to child with the child receiving both the mother's food and tongue in sucking movements, and the latter simply forgoes the premasticated food. In fact, observations across various species and cultures confirms {{that the act of}} kissing and premastication have most likely evolved from the similar relationship-based feeding behaviours.|$|E

5|$|In {{individuals}} with developmental disabilities, occurrence of self-harm is often demonstrated {{to be related}} to its effects on the environment, such as obtaining attention or desired materials or escaping demands. As developmentally disabled individuals often have communication or social deficits, self-harm may be their way of obtaining these things which they are otherwise unable to obtain in <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> appropriate way (such as by asking). One approach for treating self-harm thus is to teach an alternative, appropriate response which obtains the same result as the self-harm.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} measure {{well-being}} more generally, Amartya Sen, Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, and other feminist economists helped develop alternatives to Gross Domestic Product, {{such as the}} Human Development Index. Other models of interest to feminist economists include the labor theory of value, which was most thoroughly developed in Das Capital by Karl Marx. That model considers production as <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> constructed human project and redefines wages as means to earning a living. This refocuses economic models on human innate desires and needs as opposed to monetary incentives.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, the {{variegated}} fairywren is {{a cooperative}} breeding species, with {{small groups of}} birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. Groups consist of <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females {{as part of a}} courtship display. These birds are primarily insectivorous and forage and live in the shelter of scrubby vegetation across 90% of continental Australia, which is a wider range than that of any other fairywren.|$|E

5|$|The white-winged fairywren mainly eats insects, supplementing {{this with}} small fruits and leaf buds. It occurs in {{heathland}} and arid scrubland, where low shrubs provide cover. Like other fairywrens, it is a cooperative breeding species, and {{small groups of}} birds maintain and defend territories year-round. Groups consist of <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. These helpers are progeny that have attained sexual maturity but remain with the family group for one or more years after fledging. Although not yet confirmed genetically, the white-winged fairywren may be promiscuous and assist in raising the young from other pairings. As part of a courtship display, the male wren plucks petals from flowers and displays them to female birds.|$|E
5|$|Bearing a nice narrow pointed bill {{adapted for}} probing and {{catching}} insects, the red-winged fairywren is primarily insectivorous; it forages {{and lives in}} the shelter of scrubby vegetation in temperate wetter forests dominated by the karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor), remaining close to cover to avoid predators. Like other fairywrens, it is a cooperative breeding species, with small groups of birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. Groups consist of <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. There is {{a higher proportion of}} female helpers recorded for this species than for other species of fairywren. A variety of vocalisations and visual displays have been recorded for communication and courtship in this species. Singing is used to advertise territory, and birds can distinguish other individuals on song alone. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females as part of a courtship display.|$|E
5|$|Beatrice Hicks {{was born}} in 1919 in Orange, New Jersey, to William Lux Hicks, a {{chemical}} engineer, and Florence Benedict. Hicks decided {{at an early age}} that she wished to be an engineer. While her parents neither supported nor opposed Hicks' desired career path, some of her teachers and classmates tried to discourage her from becoming an engineer, viewing it as <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> unacceptable role for a woman. She graduated from Orange High School in 1935 and received a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Newark College of Engineering (now New Jersey Institute of Technology) in 1939, one of only two women in her class. During college, Hicks worked in the treasury office of an Abercrombie & Fitch store as a telephone operator, and in the university's library. After receiving her undergraduate degree, Hicks stayed at Newark College of Engineering for three years as a research assistant, where she studied the history of Edward Weston's inventions and took additional classes at night.|$|E

5|$|Continuity-based {{theories}} {{are held by}} a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist Steven Pinker, hold the precedents to be animal cognition, whereas those who see language as <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> learned tool of communication, such as psychologist Michael Tomasello, see it as having developed from animal communication in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation. Other continuity-based models see language as having developed from music, a view already espoused by Rousseau, Herder, Humboldt, and Charles Darwin. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist Steven Mithen. Stephen Anderson states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years and that: Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|Gosling {{came to the}} {{attention}} of a wider audience in 2004 with a leading role in the commercially successful romantic drama The Notebook. His performance as a drug-addicted teacher in Half Nelson (2006) was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor and his performance as <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> inept loner in Lars and the Real Girl (2007) was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. After a three-year acting hiatus, Gosling starred in the marital drama Blue Valentine (2010), earning him a second Golden Globe Award nomination. Gosling co-starred in three mainstream films in 2011–the romantic comedy-drama Crazy, Stupid, Love, the political drama The Ides of March, and the neo-noir crime thriller Drive–and received two more Golden Globe Award nominations. His directorial debut, Lost River, was released to poor reviews in 2014. Greater success came to Gosling when he starred in two critically acclaimed films–the financial comedy-drama The Big Short (2015) and the musical La La Land (2016). For the latter, he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and received a second Oscar nomination.|$|E
5|$|The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland {{was one of}} the Allied Powers {{during the}} First World War of 1914–1918, {{fighting}} against the Central Powers (the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Bulgaria). The state's armed forces were reorganised—the war marked the creation of the Royal Air Force, for example—and increased in size because of the introduction, in January 1916, of conscription {{for the first time in}} the kingdom's history as well as the raising of what was, at the time, the largest all-volunteer army in history, known as Kitchener's Army, of more than two million men. The outbreak of war has generally been regarded as <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> unifying event, although this view has been challenged by more recent scholarship. In any case, responses in Great Britain in 1914 were similar to those amongst populations across Europe.|$|E
