2500|$|In general, BDSM play {{is usually}} {{structured}} {{such that it}} is possible for the consenting partner to withdraw his or her consent during a scene; for example, by using a safeword that was agreed on in <b>advance.</b> <b>Use</b> of the agreed safeword (or occasionally a [...] "safe symbol" [...] such as dropping a ball or ringing a bell, especially when speech is restricted) is seen by some as an explicit withdrawal of consent. Failure to honor a safeword is considered serious misconduct and could even change the sexual consent situation into a crime, depending on the relevant law, since the bottom or top has explicitly revoked his or her consent to any actions that follow the use of the safeword (see Legal status). For other scenes, particularly in established relationships, a safeword may be agreed to signify a warning ("this is getting too intense") rather than explicit withdrawal of consent; and a few choose not to use a safeword at all. This is sometimes the case for [...] "punishment scenes" [...] between master/slave couples or for some extreme or edgeplay scenes which may include abductions, rape play, or interrogation. This scene dynamic may be referred to as [...] "consensual nonconsent". In some scenes or relationships, it may be impossible for consent to be withdrawn {{in the middle of a}} scene, or the bottom may have the ability to revoke consent for a relationship as a whole, but not for a particular scene.|$|E

50|$|In Phnom Penh {{and other}} cities in Cambodia, {{motorcycle}} taxis are widely available {{as a form of}} low-cost public transport. Motorcycle taxi drivers, who are almost exclusively male, are called motodops. They tend to hang around outside major tourist attractions, office buildings, public markets, and near the corners of residential streets. There is no regulated system of training or bike maintenance and no common uniform, so anyone {{on his way home from}} the market might offer you a ride (and the driver's intentions can generally be trusted, the state of his bike, a little less so). Always negotiate the fare in <b>advance</b> (<b>use</b> gestures, if necessary). Don't expect a motodop to understand English or to read a map - he'll likely flag somebody down who can help translate or navigate, if necessary. Fares vary depending on distance and weather but should always be cheaper than a tuk-tuk. Fares are higher at night and when embarking from tourist areas. You'll get a better rate if you can negotiate in passable Khmer, but have a heart: these are generally the folks that live on a few dollars or less per day. As of 2014, helmet laws apply only to drivers, so bring your own helmet if you're worried about safety, but it's not legally required.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} {{the identification of the}} parameters entering into the equations of motion of distributed systems. Because the motion of distributed systems is described in terms of partial differential equations, these parameters are in general continuous functions of the spatial variables. For vibrating systems, these parameters ordinarily represent the mass, stiffness and damping distributions. In this paper, these distributions are expanded in terms of finite series of known functions of the spatial variables multiplied by undetermined coefficients. It is assumed that the nature of the equations of motion is known and that a limited number of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions is identified in <b>advance.</b> <b>Use</b> is then made of the least squares method, in conjunction with the eigenfunctions' orthogonality, to compute the undetermined coefficients, thus identifying the system distributed parameters. A method for the identification of the eigensolution is also presented. The procedure for the identification of the eigensolution and of the system parameters is demonstrated via a numerical example...|$|E
40|$|Assessment of soil {{structure}} {{and still more}} its changes is impeded by peculiarities of sampling and measurement. Unavoidable local destructions tend to <b>advance</b> <b>use</b> of small numbers of replicates, samples or sampling locations. Ways out of this dilemma are discussed using the results which were obtained in the project 'Qualitative and quantitative assessment of {{soil structure}} functions for the sustainable agricultural plant production'. Bulk density(BD) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (CSAT) are {{the most frequently used}} primary parameters of soil structure. The stastistical behaviour of these both is most different. High variability of CSAT usually precludes measurement at a sufficient number of replicates for statistic analysis - particularity at soil depths below topsoil. BD has smaller variability but much smaller sensitivity as well. For measurements at greater depths in soils it is preferable nevertheless owing to the lower number of necessary replicates. A two-level outflanking procedure might facilitate sampling problems by first applying an easy-going nondestructive, unspecific method to create a narrow grid of values as a first step which might help to rationalize choice of sampling locations for destructive samplings and in-situ measurements...|$|E

40|$|The <b>advance</b> <b>use</b> {{of power}} {{electronic}} devices introduces harmonics {{in the supply}} system which creates {{a problem in the}} quality of power delivered. Good Power Quality is very much important for our day to day use of appliances in both industrial and domestic sectors. Researchers have tried and implemented many useful technology for removing all the voltage and current related harmonic occurrence problems which in turn improves the quality of power delivered to the power system. The prime focus of this thesis is the implementation of control strategies like SRF theory and instantaneous power (p-q) for the operation of Unified Power Quality Conditioner (UPQC) {{which is one of the}} recent technology that includes both series and shunt active power filter operating at the same time and thereby improves all the current and voltage related problem like voltage sag/swell, flicker, etc. at the same time and helps in reduction of Total Harmonic Distortion (THD).

40|$|The land surface skin {{temperature}} diurnal cycle (LSTD) is {{very important}} for the understanding of surface climate and for evaluating climate models. This variable, however, cannot be obtained globally from polar-orbiting satellites because the satellites usually pass a given area twice per day and because their infrared channels cannot observe the surface when the sky is cloudy. In order to more optimally use the satellite data, this research is designed, for the first time, to solve the above two problems by <b>advance</b> <b>use</b> of remote sensing techniques and climate modeling. Specifically, this work is divided into two parts. Part one deals with obtaining the skin temperature diurnal cycle for cloud-free cases. We have developed a "cloud-free algorithm" to combine model results with satellite and surface-based observations, thus interpolating satellite twice-daily observations to the diurnal cycle. Part two studies the cloudy cases. The "cloudy-pixel treatment" presented here is a hybrid technique of "neighboring-pixel" and "surface air temperature" approaches. The whole algorithm has been tested against field experiments and climate model CCM 3 /BATS in global and single column mode simulations. It shows that this proposed algorithm can obtain skin temperature diurnal cycles with an accuracy of 1 - 2 K at the monthly pixel level...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The Microcontroller based {{adjustable}} closed-loop DC {{motor speed}} controller systems has already {{become an important}} drive configuration for many applications across {{a wide range of}} power and speed. This is due to their simple control, high reliability, low cost and fast response and ability to work in all the four quadrants. Control System Design and Analysis technologies are widely suppress and very useful to be applied in real-time development. Some can be solved by hardware technology and by the <b>advance</b> <b>use</b> of software, control system are analyzed easily. This paper deals with the digital control of DC motor. The motor is controlled in all the four quadrants; in fact energy is conserved during the regenerative period. The digital controller dsPIC 30 F 4011 is used, as it is very advantageous over other controllers, as it combines the calculation capability of Digital Signal Processor and controlling capability of PIC microcontroller, to achieve precise control. In this paper, control techniques of dsPIC 30 F 4011 microcontroller and MOSFET are analyzed by mainly focusing with the Modeling and Simulation of DC Motor using MATLAB. The simulation model is developed using MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. The reason for choice of MATLAB/SIMULINK as development tool is, it is the most important and widely used simulation software. The prototype hardware set is tested in the power electronics laboratory for motor rating of 1 HP. The setup is tested for open & closed loop control of motor.
