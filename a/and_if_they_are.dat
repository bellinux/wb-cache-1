5|$|A k-coloring, {{for some}} integer k, is an {{assignment}} {{of one of}} k colors to each vertex of a graph G such that the endpoints of each edge get different colors. The k-colorings of G correspond exactly to homomorphisms from G to the complete graph K'k. Indeed, the vertices of K'k correspond to the k colors, and two colors are adjacent as vertices of K'k if <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> different. Hence a function defines a homomorphism to K'k {{if and only if}} it maps adjacent vertices of G to different colors (i.e., it is a k-coloring). In particular, G is k-colorable if and only if it is K'k-colorable.|$|E
5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> bound to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E

5|$|Metal {{artefacts}} {{share the}} same geometric designs {{that are used in}} other forms of Islamic art. However, in the view of Hamilton Gibb, the emphasis differs: geometric patterns tend to be used for borders, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in the main decorative area they are most often used in combination with other motifs such as floral designs, arabesques, animal motifs, or calligraphic script. Geometric designs in Islamic metalwork can form a grid decorated with these other motifs, or they can form the background pattern.|$|E
5|$|The Charity Commission has {{the power}} to issue an inquiry into a charity under Section 46 of the 2011 act <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{satisfied}} there has been mismanagement, they are allowed to suspend trustees or officers, appoint additional trustees, vest charity property in the Official Custodian for Charities or order debtors or people holding charity property not to transfer it without their permission. They can also remove trustees on the grounds of bankruptcy, mental incapacity, failure to act or the trustee's absence from the country. The Commission is also authorised to appoint new trustees to replace removed ones, or even {{to increase the number of}} trustees.|$|E
5|$|Workers first emerge between May and July. During {{this first}} emergence, {{reproductive}} males also emerge with this first brood and {{are called the}} early males. These males provide a great adaptation because they allow {{for the presence of}} reproductive males. Nests with a greater number of early males produce a greater number of workers, cells, pupae, and emergences. Although it is uncertain as to why, queen deaths are common in Polistes exclamans, most frequently in May. The majority of original queens are dead by July, “well before eggs that became autumn reproductive were laid,” as reproductives emerged from late August through September. Thus, queens must remain alive post June in order to birth future reproductives, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not able to do so, the eldest former worker then becomes the new queen. The reproductive early males produced may be adaptive for the deaths of the queens so that the colony will not die and will be able to continue.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that the {{statistical}} underpinnings of twin research are invalid.

25|$|The half-back flank is {{very similar}} to the back pocket position. However, a true half-back flanker is more attacking and {{concentrates}} on rebounding the ball out of the defensive 50. Sometimes half-back flankers even forgo their defensive duties in order to be more attacking. When a half-back flanker is attacking, they play like a wing-back in soccer (or an attacking full-back), <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> more defensive then they play like a traditional full-back in soccer.|$|E

These traits and their non-shedding coats mean they excel at the various Service Dog roles such as hearing dogs (assistance dogs for the deaf), mobility dogs, and seizure response dogs. They also make unusually good therapy dogs.|$|E
