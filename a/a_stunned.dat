5|$|Combat in Soul Reaver is a hack and slash system, {{involving}} {{the use of}} combinations of various different attacks before a finishing move. Raziel's enemies are grouped into humans, spectral creatures, and most commonly, vampires. Human enemies include peasants, vampire hunters and vampire worshippers. In the spectral realm, players fight minor enemies called Sluagh and the souls of dead vampires who have become wraiths. Each brood of vampire enemies has unique powers reminiscent of their clan leader. Human and spectral enemies can be killed with Raziel's claws or any weapon, but vampires must be bludgeoned into <b>a</b> <b>stunned</b> state and then destroyed by impaling them, lighting them on fire, or tossing them into a hazard such as sunlight or water. When killed, enemies leave behind souls that replenish Raziel's health, which automatically decreases in the material realm and increases in the spectral. Possession of the Soul Reaver sword stops automatic degeneration of health in the physical realm, but Raziel loses the sword instantly if he sustains damage and can regain it only by restoring his health to full.|$|E

5|$|Each time a {{successful}} attack is performed on a player, their health meter depletes. Players with low health stay stunned for longer when knocked down. A player can increase their health {{by picking up}} food items that randomly appear in the ring. Running and attacks drain stamina. If a player {{does not have enough}} stamina to perform a certain move, it becomes unavailable until they recover. Stamina is regained through not pressing the actions buttons or picking up certain items. Attacks which require more stamina are generally more effective. The stun meter only appears when the opponent is knocked down. It depletes gradually, but the stunned player cannot move until the Stun meter is completely drained. A player can reduce the stun meter faster by pressing the action buttons, or by receiving certain attacks. If a player is low on health, the stun meter will normally be higher, making pin attempts harder to resist. Once a player's health is completely depleted, it will only take one hit to stun them. Certain attacks to <b>a</b> <b>stunned</b> opponent will actually reset the stun meter.|$|E
5|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back {{was written by}} Josh Mancell from Mutato Muzika, while the sound effects were created by Universal Sound Studios (consisting of Mike Gollom, Ron Horwitz and Kevin Spears). The {{characters}} were designed by Charles Zembillas of American Exitus, Incorporated. Clancy Brown provided the voice of Doctor Neo Cortex, while Brendan O'Brien voiced the dual role of Crash Bandicoot, Doctor N. Gin and Doctor Nitrus Brio and Vicki Winters voiced Coco Bandicoot. The game was unveiled at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta, Georgia in June 1997 to a positive response from the game industry. The game went into the alpha stage in August 1997. Around that time, Dan Arey, the lead designer of , joined Naughty Dog and streamlined the level design. A death animation in which Crash is squashed into <b>a</b> <b>stunned</b> head and feet was altered for the Japanese version of the game due to its resemblance to the severed head and shoes left by a serial killer loose in Japan at the time.|$|E

50|$|There {{are various}} designs of {{electric}} cattle prods. Their shape is often subject to guidelines {{of what can}} easily be used and handled. They range in length from six inches (usually of a more encased rectangular prism design like <b>a</b> <b>stun</b> gun), to up to six feet. As the precursor of stun guns, cattle prods also have {{a wide range of}} voltage with enough amperage to operate {{in the same manner as}} <b>a</b> <b>stun</b> gun does against humans. <b>A</b> <b>stun</b> gun is nothing more than a beefed up cattle prod and both can be used on humans or animals by design. Whether it is called a cattle prod or <b>a</b> <b>stun</b> gun, both units are shaped for easy carry and function in the same manner against animals or humans. Most are simple designs powered by 9-volt or a combination of other types of batteries. Anything out of that range is usually too heavy and unwieldy for practical use. Another typical design is a box containing a large battery (or battery pack) at the handle end and wires embedded in a fibreglass rod, ending with two electrodes in a rubber tip. This design is well-suited for use as a regular cattle prod.|$|R

SIUE's defense turned away everything sent at them, but made a bad habit of clearing the ball over the end line to set up Lipscomb corner kicks. The game was still scoreless with {{less than two minutes}} remaining in the second extra period when the Bisons set up for their eighth corner of the game. Cougar defenders turned away two Lipscomb headers, but the final clearance rebounded off a charging Bisons forward, falling into the net past <b>a</b> <b>stunned</b> Dal Santo.|$|E
25|$|Democrats began 1968 {{expecting that}} President Johnson, who was constitutionally {{eligible}} for election {{to a second}} full term under {{the provisions of the}} 22nd Amendment, would again be the party's presidential nominee. Those expectations were shattered by Senator Eugene McCarthy, who had entered the campaign late in November to give voice to those in the party opposed to Johnson's Vietnam policies. McCarthy narrowly lost to Johnson in the first Democratic Party primary on March 12 in New Hampshire, winning 42% of the vote to Johnson's 49%. The results startled the party establishment and spurred Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York to enter the race. Two weeks later, Johnson told <b>a</b> <b>stunned</b> the nation that he would not seek a second term. In the weeks that followed, much of the momentum that had been moving the McCarthy campaign forward shifted toward Kennedy. This, one of the most tumultuous Democratic primary election seasons in modern times, concluded with Kennedy being assassination on June 4 in Los Angeles, following a rally celebrating his victory in the California primary.|$|E

They are startled by a scream from Gustave, who awakens from a nightmare and rushes into the room. Christine introduces the Phantom as an old friend named Mr. Y, and he promises to show the boy around Phantasma the next day ("Mother Please, I'm Scared!").|$|E
