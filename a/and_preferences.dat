5|$|Marvel vs. Capcom 3 {{includes}} online play using Microsoft's Xbox Live and Sony's PlayStation Network services. Online multiplayer includes ranked matches, where players {{battle to}} increase their rank and ascend the game's leaderboards; player matches, which do not bestow rank and offer options for quick rematches; and player lobbies, which allow up to eight players in a single room {{to compete in a}} king of the hill-style format. When an online match begins, both players can view their opponent's License Card. License Cards keep track of players' tendencies based on fighting style, record player points and total number of wins and losses, and allow players to see the positive and negative points of their play styles. Included among the online features is Shadow Battle, a series of downloadable content packs that allow the player to fight against a team of AI-controlled opponents programmed after the techniques <b>and</b> <b>preferences</b> of Capcom's development staff and famous players from the fighting game community.|$|E

The LTA's ACE Magazine advertised Power Tennis and featured competitions offering the game as a prize. Nintendo also released an online questionnaire regarding players' habits <b>and</b> <b>preferences</b> in relation to tennis {{as a part of}} their Who Are You? campaign. Nintendo announced in 2008 that they would be re-releasing the title as part of their New Play Control! selection, which feature added Wii controls. The game can be controlled using the Wii Remote and optional Nunchuk attachment, allowing the player to trigger actions such as forehands and backhands by swinging the Remote like a tennis racket. It was released on January 15, 2009 in Japan and on March 2009 in other countries. It was later re-released in North America on June 10, 2012 along with Pikmin 2 as Nintendo Selects titles.|$|E

50|$|Grace and Nevin (1997) {{assessed}} both relative {{resistance to}} change in a multiple schedule <b>and</b> <b>preference</b> in a concurrent-chains procedure with pigeons pecking lighted disks for food reinforcement. When the relative rate of reinforcement was manipulated identically and simultaneously across stimulus contexts in the multiple schedule and concurrent-chains procedure, both relative {{resistance to change}} <b>and</b> <b>preference</b> was greater with richer contexts of reinforcement. When all the extant resistance to change <b>and</b> <b>preference</b> data were summarized by Grace, Bedell, and Nevin (2002), they found that those measures were related by a structural relation slope of 0.29. Therefore, relative resistance to change <b>and</b> <b>preference</b> both have been conceptualized as expressions of an underlying construct termed response strength, conditioned reinforcement value, or more generally, behavioral mass of discriminated operant behavior (see Nevin & Grace, 2000).|$|R

Results: We plot the motion of the economy and conduct a comparative dynamic analysis with regard to certain parameters to obtain insights into interactions between the <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> the economic structural changes. Conclusions: We have shown that habit formation <b>and</b> <b>preference</b> change have significant effects on the economic grow and resources utilization both with regard to the transitional paths and the long-run equilibrium...|$|R
