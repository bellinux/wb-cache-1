The silicone rubber and the fumed <b>amorphous</b> <b>silica</b> represent the system with the chemical affinity on the molecular basis. The comparative system without the chemical affinity was the epoxy resin and the same filler. It follows from the evaluation of performed experiments, that: {{the effect of the}} filler on the polymere matrix is very significant and positive {{in the case of the}} system of fumed <b>amorphous</b> <b>silica</b> - silicone rubber. This effect is explained not only on the basis of the use of particle filler ultramicroscopic dimension and the good interface adhesion but the significant chemical affinity of both material compounds, too. The fumed <b>amorphous</b> <b>silica</b> is the reinforcing filler in this polymere composite system with the expressive apply to the synergic behaviour of the used material compounds. The comparative experiments were performed with bigger dimension particles like the precipitated <b>amorphous</b> <b>silica</b> and the coarse-grained quartz sand. The experiments indicate differences in the behaviour of the ultramicroscopic filler, the microscopic filler and the macroscopic filler.

40|$|Adhesion forces between submicrometer-sized {{silicate}} grains play {{a crucial}} role in the formation of silicate dust agglomerates, rocky planetesimals, and terrestrial planets. The surface energy of silicate dust particles is the key to their adhesion and rolling forces in a theoretical model based on the contact mechanics. Here we revisit the cohesion of <b>amorphous</b> <b>silica</b> spheres by compiling available data on the surface energy for hydrophilic <b>amorphous</b> <b>silica</b> in various circumstances. It turned out that the surface energy for hydrophilic <b>amorphous</b> <b>silica</b> in a vacuum is a factor of 10 higher than previously assumed. Therefore, the previous theoretical models underestimated the critical velocity for the sticking of <b>amorphous</b> <b>silica</b> spheres, as well as the rolling friction forces between them. With the most plausible value of the surface energy for <b>amorphous</b> <b>silica</b> spheres, theoretical models based on the contact mechanics are in harmony with laboratory experiments. Consequently, we conclude that silicate grains with a radius of 0. 1 μm could grow to planetesimals via coagulation in a protoplanetary disk.

30|$|Considering {{the shape}} of the portion, the high content of silicon, as well as the {{amorphous}} state, this deposit could be interpreted as the product of precipitation of <b>amorphous</b> <b>silica</b> enriched in impurities. According to the experimental work by Wang et al. [35], magadiite, a hydrous sodium silicate phyllosilicate (NaSi 7 O 13 (OH) 3 · 4 (H 2 O)), precipitates from a hydrous silica solution in hydrothermal conditions (120  °C) after 1  day of heating.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Inhalation of {{crystalline}} silica {{is known to}} cause an inflammatory reaction and chronic exposure leads to lung fibrosis and can progress into the disease, silicosis. Cultured macrophages bind {{crystalline silica}} particles, phagocytose them, and rapidly undergo apoptotic and necrotic death. The mechanism by which particles are bound and internalized and the reason particles are toxic is unclear. <b>Amorphous</b> <b>silica</b> has been {{considered to be a}} less toxic form, but this view is controversial. We compared the uptake and toxicity of <b>amorphous</b> <b>silica</b> to crystalline <b>silica.</b> METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: <b>Amorphous</b> <b>silica</b> particles are phagocytosed by macrophage cells and a single internalized particle is capable of killing a cell. Fluorescent dextran is released from endo-lysosomes within two hours after silica treatment and Caspase- 3 activation occurs within 4 hours. Interestingly, toxicity is specific to macrophage cell lines. Other cell types are resistant to silica particle toxicity even though they internalize the particles. The large and uniform size of the spherical, <b>amorphous</b> <b>silica</b> particles allowed us to monitor them during the uptake process. In mCherry-actin transfected macrophages, actin rings began to form 1 - 3 minutes after silica binding and the actin coat disassembled rapidly following particle internalization. Pre-loading cells with fluorescent dextran allowed us to visualize the fusion of phagosomes with endosomes during internalization. These markers provided two new ways to visualize and quantify particle internalization. At 37 °C the rate of <b>amorphous</b> <b>silica</b> internalization was very rapid regardless of particle coating. However, at room temperature, opsonized silica is internalized much faster than non-opsonized silica. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that <b>amorphous</b> and crystalline <b>silica</b> are both phagocytosed and both toxic to mouse alveolar macrophage (MH-S) cells. The pathway leading to apoptosis appears to be similar in both cases. However, the result suggests a mechanistic difference between FcγRIIA receptor-mediated and non-opsonized silica particle phagocytosis...|$|R
