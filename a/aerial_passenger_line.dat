40|$|Line {{configuration}} has direct {{impacts on}} the system operating cost, passenger travel time and line transfers. The travel time and number of transfers taken by the passengers are dependent on <b>passenger</b> <b>line</b> assignment and the line configuration. Unfortunately, the interplay between transit <b>line</b> configuration and <b>passenger</b> <b>line</b> assignment has been largely ignored in the literature. This thesis presents a model for simultaneous optimization of transit <b>line</b> configuration and <b>passenger</b> <b>line</b> assignment in a general network. The model is formulated into a linear binary integer program and can be solved by any integer solver. The standard branch and bound method {{is used in the}} model. The model is illustrated with a couple of minimum spanning tree networks and a simplified version of the Hong Kong MTR network...|$|R
