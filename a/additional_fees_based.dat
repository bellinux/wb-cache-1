50|$|A {{bandwidth}} cap, {{also known}} as a band cap or a data cap, is an artificial restriction imposed on the transfer of data over a network. In particular, it refers to policies imposed by an internet service provider in order to limit customers' usage of their services; typically, exceeding a data cap would require the subscriber to pay <b>additional</b> <b>fees</b> <b>based</b> on whether they have exceeded this limit. Implementation of a bandwidth cap is sometimes termed a fair access policy, fair usage policy, or usage-based billing.|$|E

If you have not yet acquired SAP software, you should make sure you use an experienced IT licensing lawyer before contracting. If you agree to SAP’s standard licence terms and use the software in a way not expressly permitted by the licence, it could cost you {{tens of millions of}} dollars in completely unexpected incremental licence and maintenance fees. That is what happened to a UK company in a questionable decision released in the case of SAP UK Ltd v Diageo Great Britain Ltd. Diageo had paid SAP between £ 50 m and £ 61 m in licence and maintenance fees to use the mySAP Business Suite. It integrated the suite with software from Salesforce using SAP PI integrator software. SAP claimed a staggering £ 54, 503, 578 in <b>additional</b> <b>fees</b> <b>based</b> on API access to its software. A judge in England on the liability aspect of the case sided with SAP on its right to collect additional licence and maintenance fees. However, the amount owing remains to be determined...|$|E

In other words, an <b>additional</b> <b>fee</b> for the filing of divisional applications of the second or any further generation was introduced. The amount of the <b>additional</b> <b>fees</b> was announced in December 2013. The purpose of the <b>additional</b> <b>fee</b> is [...] "to discourage the filing of long sequences of divisional applications", so as to also discourage [...] "the prolongation of pendency periods". The [...] "use of divisional applications as a tool for prolonging the pendency of subject-matter before the EPO" [...] has been regarded by the EPO as [...] "detrimental to legal certainty for third parties as well as to patent office workloads".|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{methods of}} {{evaluating}} design changes fee in construction projects {{often lead to}} dispute. Sometimes it leads to unacceptable claim {{because it is not}} easy for consultant engineers to justify the amount of changes they have performed. This study has been done with the aim to propose the new approach of evaluating the additional work done due to design changes by using BIM (Building information models) system. The methodologies used for this study are literature reviews and interviews with the construction professionals. In addition, a building model is simulated in “Autodesk Revit Structure” software to illustrate the process of automated system for evaluating design changes fee. The findings showed that the most current method practice in Malaysia is based on the Percentage of Construction Cost, Salary Cost Times Multiplier and Man-Hour. This study has developed an alternative method using BIM for assessing the <b>additional</b> design changes <b>fee</b> <b>based</b> on the construction cost which derived from BIM’s quantity take-offs automated system. The result of the benefit of the newly proposed system has been validated through interviews with expert panels. It is hope that this method will be more acceptable by Malaysian construction industry players in the future considering the benefit of this approach as establish in this study...|$|R

5000|$|If the {{applicant}} {{disagrees with the}} ISA’s finding of lack of unity of invention, the <b>additional</b> <b>fees</b> may be paid under protest.

The corresponding threshold for H-1B-dependency is 15%, but one way these thresholds differ is that the 50% threshold for the <b>additional</b> <b>fees</b> requires the employer to count people in H-1B as well as people in L-1 status. Also, unlike the case of additional LCA attestations, there is no exemption for people based on how much they are earning or their educational qualifications.|$|R
