40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{completeness}} and quality of audit reports as perceived by internal audit’s primary customer – the audit committee. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire that was sent to audit committee chairpersons of banks registered with the South African Reserve Bank. Respondents were asked to provide their perceptions of the quality of the internal audit reports they routinely received. The results highlight that not all internal audit functions present clear <b>and</b> <b>appropriately</b> focused <b>reports.</b> Whilst the audit committee chairpersons recognise that the internal audit reports do have value, there is also significant potential for improvement.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "GAO examined the environmental cleanup costs of ongoing operations of the Department of Defense (DOD). These include general property, plant, and equipment facilities or other assets that are being operated or are in use at DOD installations. GAO found that DOD has not developed policies, procedures, and methodologies to ensure that cleanup costs required {{for all of its}} ongoing and inactive or closed operations are identified, consistently estimated, <b>and</b> <b>appropriately</b> <b>reported.</b> As a result, DOD's financial statements and environmental reports continue to underreport environmental liabilities and related long-term budgetary needs. The military installations GAO visited had a total of 221 sites with estimated cleanup costs of $ 259 million. Of these, only 45 sites with estimated cleanup costs of $ 61 million were being reported for the Defense Environmental Restoration Program Annual Report to Congress, and only that amount was likely included in DOD's financial statements. GAO found DOD was not reporting 149 sites related to ongoing operations with estimated cleanup costs of $ 91 million and 27 inactive and closed operations with estimated cleanup costs of $ 107 million. The environmental offices at the six installations GAO visited had comprehensive records for the installation sites subject to cleanup requirements. Although these records were reasonably accurate, the records used to maintain accountability over related land, buildings, and structures were significantly flawed. If properly maintained, the real property records should {{play a significant role in}} ensuring the accuracy of environmental site records. ...|$|R
40|$|Gastric volvulus is a {{potentially}} lethal condition with significant {{morbidity and mortality}} if not recognized and managed promptly <b>and</b> <b>appropriately.</b> We <b>report</b> a case of gastric volvulus secondary to paraesophageal hernia causing gastric necrosis and perforation of the gastroesophageal junction. An 82 -year-old woman with a large parae-sophageal hernia was admitted to our hospital with vague epigastric and right-sided chest pain. She was taken to surgery and laparotomy findings included a large paraesophageal hernia, gastric volvulus with ischemia, frank gangrene and perforation at the gastroesophageal junction. She underwent reduction of the hernia and gastric volvulus with partial gastroesophagectomy and formation of an esophagogas-trostomy anastomosis. Due to the patient’s old age and associated co-morbidities, her prognosis remained poor post-operatively and she was transferred to hospice care as per family wishes. This case report is intended to educate clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for acute gastric volvulus and its potential complications in the ap-propriate clinical setting to allow for early surgical intervention and appropriate management...|$|R

However, the extent of current PRO impact, barriers and facilitators of impact and metrics to assess PRO specific impact are currently unclear. The aim of this study was 1) to conduct a systematic review to identify: i) common types of research impact associated with PRO trial data, ii) existing metrics used to measure PRO impact and iii) factors that may affect PRO-related impact; 2) to assess REF 2014 impact case studies to explore real-world evidence of PRO data impact.|$|R
40|$|QTM {{software}} is a Windows based application, which takes {{information provided by}} ProReflex cameras and generates 2 D, 3 D, and/or 6 degree of freedom (DOF) data.

40|$|Patients with ADHD {{may have}} better {{adherence}} to treatment with modified-release methylphenidate (MPH-MR) formulations, which are taken once daily, compared with immediate-release (IR) formulations, which {{need to be}} taken several times a day. Data on long-term outcomes such as adherence may be lacking from randomised controlled trials as these are usually only short-term. Observational studies, if performed <b>and</b> <b>reported</b> <b>appropriately,</b> can provide valuable long-term data on such outcomes, as well as additional information on effectiveness and efficiency, from a real-life setting. By reviewing previous observational studies that have investigated switching treatment from MPH-IR to MPH-MR, results from a new, naturalistic observational study, the OBSEER study, are put into context. We conclude that, based on observational trial data, switching from MPH-IR to MPH-MR is a valid clinical approach, with the potential for improved clinical outcome and treatment adherence...|$|R
40|$|To {{explore the}} {{variability}} in biosensor studies, 150 participants from 20 countries were given the same protein samples and asked to determine kinetic rate constants for the interaction. We chose a protein system that was amenable to analysis using different biosensor platforms {{as well as by}} users of different expertise levels. The two proteins (a 50 -kDa Fab and a 60 -kDa glutathione S-transferase [GST] antigen) form a relatively high-affinity complex, so participants needed to optimize several experimental parameters, including ligand immobilization and regeneration conditions as well as analyte concentrations and injection/dissociation times. Although most participants collected binding responses that could be fit to yield kinetic parameters, the quality of a few data sets could have been improved by optimizing the assay design. Once these outliers were removed, the average reported affinity across the remaining panel of participants was 620 pM {{with a standard deviation of}} 980 pM. These results demonstrate that when this biosensor assay was designed <b>and</b> executed <b>appropriately,</b> the <b>reported</b> rate constants were consistent, and independent of which protein was immobilized and which biosensor was used...|$|R
40|$|Bullying {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{pervasive}} challenges in schools across the world. This investigation is an evaluation of a school’s attempt to address the large number of incidents of bullying. Materials from the Bully Free Classroom (BFC) by Allan Beane (2009) served as the intervention curriculum for 21, fifth grade students and six teachers. A 14 -week (with the exception of school breaks), six lesson intervention was implemented with three groups of students: two groups identified as perpetrators and one group of victims. Teachers received training on bullying knowledge <b>and</b> how to <b>appropriately</b> <b>report</b> bullying-related incidents. Pre and post measures of bullying knowledge, frequency ratings of bullying and prosocial behaviors observed, and discipline referrals for bullying served as the dependent measures for the student participants. Results support the use of the intervention as the mean number of discipline referrals for participants of bully status significantly decreased, student ratings for negative behaviors significantly decreased, student knowledge of bullying significantly increased, and teacher’s ratings of the frequency of bullying decreased while school climate ratings became more positive. Moderate to large effect sizes are interpreted to provide strong support for a recommendation for school-wide adoption of the program. The scope and nature of the intervention plan is discussed in relation to recommended features of bully prevention and intervention programs and recommendations are made for implementation of this intervention...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{systematic}} review aimed {{to assess the}} neuropsychological outcomes of temporal lobe resections for epilepsy in children. Additional objectives included determining whether earlier age at surgery leads to better neuropsychological outcomes; the relationships between and predictors of these outcomes. Methods: Using advanced search terms, a {{systematic review}} of electronic databases was conducted, comprising MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science and CINAHL. Included studies reported on outcome following neurosurgical treatment for epilepsy. Specifically, studies were included if they reported neuropsychological outcomes and were concerned only with temporal lobe resection. Results: 73 studies met inclusion criteria. For reported neuropsychological outcomes, {{the majority of participants}} remained stable after surgery; some declined and some improved. There was some evidence for increased material-specific memory deficits after temporal lobe surgery based on resection side, and more positive cognitive outcome for those with lower pre-surgical ability level. Significance: Retrieved evidence highlights the need for improvements to quality of methodology <b>and</b> <b>reporting.</b> <b>Appropriately</b> designed prospective multicentre trials should be conducted with adequate follow-up for long-term outcomes to be measured. Core outcome measures should be agreed between centres. This would permit higher quality evidence so that clinicians, young people and their families may make better informed decisions about whether or not to proceed with surgery and likely post-operative profile...|$|R
40|$|This study explores whether {{security}} analysts recognize firms’ going-concern problems <b>and</b> <b>report</b> <b>appropriately</b> to investors. We {{find that}} analysts signal their {{anticipation of the}} publication of a going-concern modified (GCM) audit report in two ways: 1) they downgrade more aggressively stock recommendations of GCM firms than stock recommendations of control firms as the event date approaches; 2) {{they are more likely to}} cease coverage of a GCM firm than a control firm over the one-year period prior to the GCM date. We further show that analysts react to {{the publication of a}}n actual GCM audit report by stopping coverage of such firms immediately subsequent to the event disclosure. Our results suggest that analysts know that the future viability of GCM firms is jeopardized but do not say it clearly to retail investors, who constitute the main clientele of these firms. Consistent with the SEC concerns about analyst recommendations, we conclude that investors cannot rely solely on analyst recommendations since they are reluctant to report negatively (i. e, “underperform” or “sell”) even in this extreme bad news domain. We further conclude that analyst relative pessimism and coverage cessation is likely to be associated with negative expectations about firms’ future prospects.
