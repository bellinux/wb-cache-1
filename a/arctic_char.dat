5|$|Whitefish and vendace are {{the most}} common fish species in Lake Inari, the latter having been accidentally naturalized. Lake trout can be caught in creeks. Other fish found in the park include <b>Arctic</b> <b>char,</b> grayling, pike, perch, burbot, three-spined stickleback, ninespine stickleback and minnow. Stocking with fish has {{resulted}} in the introduction of Atlantic salmon, vendace and lake trout.|$|E
5|$|The {{waters of}} {{south-west}} Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including basking sharks, Atlantic grey seals, leatherback turtles, dolphins, porpoises, jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion {{in particular are}} recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins, and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins {{in the whole of}} the UK. River fish of note include char, eel, salmon, shad, sparling and <b>Arctic</b> <b>char,</b> whilst the Gwyniad is unique to Wales, found only in Bala Lake. Wales is also known for its shellfish, including cockles, limpet, mussels and periwinkles. Herring, mackerel and hake are the more common of the country's seafish.|$|E
5|$|Entrance to {{national}} park is available by boat in Wijdefjorden from the north, or over land from Billefjorden and Dicksonfjorden from the south. During winter, {{the area is}} accessible from Longyearbyen, either by snowmobile or by ski. There are several older trapper cabins in the park, {{and some of these}} are lent to residents of Longyearbyen. Except for Einsteinvatnet, a lake with <b>Arctic</b> <b>char,</b> there are few destinations within the park, although the park {{can be used as a}} basis for other destinations. This includes trips to Perriertoppen, Svalbard's second-highest peak, and the glacier Åsgårdsfonna. Because of the shape of the park, there is little good hiking within the park, except for walking along the beaches on either side of the fjord. It is possible to see the entire national park from Mittag-Lefflerbreen, which can be hiked to from Pyramiden.|$|E
50|$|<b>Arctic</b> <b>chars,</b> trouts {{and common}} minnows {{are found in}} the park's lakes, rivers and streams.|$|R
50|$|It is {{also the}} home to other {{wildlife}} species which are muskoxen, grizzly bears, <b>Arctic</b> <b>chars,</b> red foxes, wolverines, Arctic ground squirrels, collared lemmings, and wolves. Tuktut Nogait is a major breeding and nesting ground {{for a wide variety}} of migratory birds. Raptors such as peregrine falcons, rough-legged hawks, gyr falcons and golden eagles nest along the steep walls of river canyons.|$|R
5000|$|Alaska Fishing {{says the}} river [...] "makes an {{exciting}} float...with some potentially good fishing...". [...] Boating dangers include overhanging vegetation and bears, which feed on salmon. The main game fish frequenting the Tikchik are <b>Arctic</b> grayling, <b>char,</b> and red salmon, {{as well as}} lake trout in the lakes.|$|R
5|$|While {{work on the}} Synopsis of Quadrupeds {{was still}} in progress, Pennant decided on a journey to Scotland, a {{relatively}} unexplored country and not previously visited by a naturalist. He set out in June 1769 and kept a journal and made sketches as he travelled. He visited the Farne Islands off the Northumberland coast on the way and was much impressed by the breeding seabird colonies. He entered Scotland via Berwick-on-Tweed and proceeded via Edinburgh and up the east coast, continuing through Perth, Aberdeen and Inverness. His return journey south took him through Fort William, Glen Awe, Inverary and Glasgow. He was unimpressed by the climate but was interested in all he saw and made enquiries about the local economy. He described in detail the scenery around Loch Ness. He enthused over the <b>Arctic</b> <b>char,</b> a fish new to him but did not mention a monster in the lake. He observed red deer, black grouse, white hares and ptarmigan. He saw the capercaillie in the forests of Glenmoriston and Strathglass and mentioned the pine grosbeak, the only occasion on which it has been recorded from Scotland. He enquired into the fisheries and commerce of the different places he passed through and visited the great houses, reporting on the antiquities he found there. He finished his journey by visiting Edinburgh again and travelling through Moffat, Gretna and Carlisle {{on his way back}} to Wales, having taken about three months on his travels. On his return home, Pennant wrote an account of his tour in Scotland which met with some acclaim and which may have been responsible for an increase in the number of English people visiting the country.|$|E
25|$|Saltwater and {{freshwater}} fish including sculpin, Arctic cod, <b>Arctic</b> <b>char,</b> capelin and lake trout.|$|E
25|$|The sparctic char is an {{intrageneric}} hybrid {{between the}} brook trout and the <b>Arctic</b> <b>char</b> (S. alpinus).|$|E
5000|$|Floatfishing {{is popular}} on this river, {{although}} Alaska Fishing warns {{that this is}} [...] "not a river for inexperienced boaters." [...] There are no formal campgrounds or other accommodations along the river. Game fish on the Chilikadrotna include silver salmon, <b>Arctic</b> grayling, <b>char,</b> rainbow trout, and lake trout.|$|R
50|$|Game fish inhabiting the Nuyakuk include rainbow trout, <b>char,</b> <b>Arctic</b> grayling, silver salmon, king salmon, {{and lake}} trout. Anglers {{generally}} reach the river by floatplane or boat; accommodations include a private lodge along the upper river. There are good campsites except along the lower river near the mouth.|$|R
50|$|A {{relatively}} {{straight and}} braided river, it descends from {{an elevation of}} about 500 ft to sea level. Being quite shallow, it is not navigable beyond its lower reaches. Although game fish on the river include king, chum, and silver salmon, the main species are rainbow trout, <b>Arctic</b> grayling, and <b>char.</b>|$|R
25|$|Only four {{species of}} fish have been reported: <b>Arctic</b> <b>char</b> (Salvelinus alpinus), lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), {{lumpfish}} (Cyclopterus lumpus) and ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius).|$|E
25|$|The lakes {{are mainly}} {{populated}} with <b>Arctic</b> <b>char,</b> brown trout, and burbot. The {{waters of the}} park are renowned for their abundance and have been protected since 1962.|$|E
25|$|Salmon {{frequent}} several Lewis rivers after {{crossing the}} Atlantic. Many of the fresh-water lochs {{are home to}} fish such as trout. Other freshwater fish present include <b>Arctic</b> <b>char,</b> European eel, 3 and 9 spined sticklebacks, thick-lipped mullet and flounder.|$|E
50|$|The Mulchatna River {{and one of}} its tributaries, the Chilikadrotna River, {{are popular}} Southwest Alaska {{destinations}} for floatfishing. Other Mulchatna tributaries, including the Stuyahok and Koktuli rivers, are also popular fishing streams. The main game fish frequenting the Mulchatna are king salmon, silver salmon, <b>char,</b> <b>Arctic</b> grayling, and rainbow trout.|$|R
5000|$|Alaska Fishing {{describes}} the river as [...] "one of Alaska's most celebrated {{salmon and trout}} streams". The main game fish are rainbow trout, <b>char,</b> <b>Arctic</b> grayling, king (Chinook), silver (Coho), chum, and red (sockeye) salmon. Anglers can floatfish down from the headwaters with Float Alaska, hire a boat to go upriver from Quinhagak, or fish near tent camps and lodges along the lower river.|$|R
5000|$|In 1980, {{the upper}} 80 mi {{of the river}} was {{protected}} as [...] "wild" [...] {{as part of the}} National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Managed by the Bureau of Land Management, the wild segment of the river is fished for king and silver salmon, <b>Arctic</b> grayling, and <b>char.</b> Other forms of recreation along the river include boating and camping in summer and snowmobiling, dog mushing, ice fishing, hunting, and trapping in winter. For part of its length, the Iditarod Trail runs along the Unalakleet.|$|R
25|$|Though {{there is}} an {{abundance}} of seal, walrus, and <b>Arctic</b> <b>char</b> that promoted habitation, the settlement area is bereft of trees and wood. Some brushwood is scattered amongst stones. Wildflowers and moss are found nearby, but berries are located miles further afield.|$|E
25|$|Among American {{species of}} charr, the kype reaches its maximum {{size in the}} large {{anadromous}} males, Dolly Varden trout (Salvelinus malma) and Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), whereas it is reportedly hardly visible or absent in large nonanadromous males, <b>Arctic</b> <b>char</b> (Salvelinus alpinus) and Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush).|$|E
25|$|The Lakes of Killarney contain many {{brown trout}} {{and an annual}} run of salmon. Rare species found in the lakes are <b>Arctic</b> <b>char</b> and Killarney shad. The lakes have natural stocks of brown trout and salmon that can be fished, subject only to usual Irish salmon license regulations.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the large}} numbers of salmon, there is a {{significant}} bear population in the summer and fall, including both grizzly and black bears. [...] The majority of the catchment area is a winter habitat for Alaskan caribou. Moose are also to be found during the entire year. Along the river, beaver, foxes, wolverines, mink, and otter are all found as well occasional wolf. In the water, there are several varieties of salmon, including sockeye salmon, pink salmon, chum salmon, king salmon, and silver salmon. There are also rainbow trout, <b>char,</b> <b>Arctic</b> grayling, and northern pike. Along the river there is also eclectic vegetation including spruces, willows and various types of berries.|$|R
40|$|Photosynthesis vs. {{irradiance}} {{relationships were}} determined for phytoplankton communities from seven lakes in the Canadian high <b>Arctic,</b> including ultraoligotrophic <b>Char</b> Lake, nutrient-enriched Meretta Lake, and two meromictic lakes. The derived photosynthetic parameters were low for all samples, {{with a mean}} (�SD) light-saturated photosynthetic rate (P) of 0. 46 (� 0. 28) g C g� 1 chlorophyll a (Chl a) h� 1 and a mean �B B (light-limitation parameter) m of 1. 23 (� 0. 56) g C g� 1 Chl a m 2 mol� 1. The saturation irradiance (Ek) ranged from 50 to 196 �mol quanta m� 2 s� 1 and {{was positively correlated with}} mean irradiance for the water column. Quantum yields for photosynthesis in the Arctic lake phytoplankton were also low (mostly � 10 mmol C mol� 1 quanta). An intersystem comparison of �B B and Pm values with literature data for algae from other cold environments showed that the photosynthetic parameters for phytoplankton in Arctic and Antarctic lakes are three- to sixfold lower than for marine algae, ice algae, and cultures over the same low-temperature range. This {{may be the result of}} more severe nutrient stress in high-latitude lakes relative to polar marine environments and to the persistence of nonactive pigments in col...|$|R
50|$|The Arctic Lowlands and Hudson Bay Lowlands are a physiographic division, lying {{between the}} Canadian Shield and the Innuitian regionTo {{the south of}} the {{surfaces}} and lowland plains. This is a region of tundra, a treeless Plain, with a cold, dry climate and poorly drained soil. Most of the Arctic Lowlands region is located in Nunavut. The Arctic Lowlands are plains located in Canada. Plains are extensive areas of level or gently rolling land. In North America there is a large, flat interior Plain. They are also part of what is commonly referred to as the Arctic Archipelago, occupying much of the central Canadian Arctic. They are made up of a series of islands located in Canada's far north, and have remains frozen most of the year. However, the Paleozoic sedimentary rock, from which the Lowlands are formed, contains lignite (a form of coal), oil, and natural gas deposits. Limestone is very abundant as well. The Arctic Lowlands have a small human population. The terrain is mostly ice, snow, rock, and it is full of marshes, especially in the winter. Animals that live in the area include polar bears, <b>char,</b> <b>Arctic</b> hares and Arctic foxes. This region is being affected by global warming. It is very cold and human life may be difficult. Many suffer from lack of food in this region. Commonly known as the Hudson Bay-Arctic Lowlands, the Hudson Bay part is over 50% water.|$|R
25|$|The young {{rivers in}} the upper glens are {{spawning}} grounds for salmon and brown trout. <b>Arctic</b> <b>char,</b> isolated in the Wicklow lakes {{following the end of}} the last ice age, have been recorded in Lough Dan and the lakes of Glendalough but are now believed extinct. A programme to reintroduce them into the Upper Lake at Glendalough commenced in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Canada's rivers {{are famous}} for their annual runs of Atlantic salmon {{on the east coast}} and Pacific salmon on the west coast. Canada's many {{freshwater}} lakes and streams are home to rainbow trout, <b>Arctic</b> <b>char,</b> and brook trout. In the past, invasive species such as the lamprey and zebra mussel have threatened these native species, and while efforts to combat them have been made they still remain a hazard in some areas, and there are ongoing effort {{to prevent the spread of}} Asian carp from the United States.|$|E
25|$|The provincial fish is {{the brown}} trout which is found {{together}} with common whitefish, grayling, European perch, <b>Arctic</b> <b>char,</b> burbot, salmon and the carnivorous northern pike. Roughly 250 types of birds {{have been observed}} in Jämtland. The species presence greatly varies, in the fells bluethroat, long-tailed skua, Eurasian dotterel, ptarmigan, Lapland and snow bunting are found. The forested region is inhabited by species such as hazel hen, black grouse, capercaillie, Siberian jay, three-toed woodpecker and rustic bunting. Several different types of owls dwells in the province and the provincial owl is the northern hawk owl.|$|E
60|$|They sank ankle-deep in ashes in the brûlée, rent {{their limbs}} and {{garments}} smashing through the muskeg, melted the snow with their camp-fires by lakes and streams whose shores even the wandering prospector's foot had scarcely trodden, and slept, or lay awake shivering, with boots in the embers and half-frozen bodies radiating like spokes from {{the hub of}} crackling fire, while the smoke, which was sharp with the sting of the resin, curled about them. Ingleby's shoulders bled daily and troubled him seriously in the frost at night, a seam of his boot had fretted a raw place across his foot, and in the bitter mornings the cold struck deep and keen. Twelve pounds more count for a good deal when the burden is already all that its bearer is fit to carry, and the effort drained the store of heat in his worn-out body and left nothing for the up-keep of its vitality. That heat {{is the source of}} energy everybody knows, but only those who have taxed every muscle in the cold of the Northwest realize the fact's full significance. The man who has tried his strength too hard in the <b>Arctic</b> frost may <b>char</b> his boots in the camp-fire, but he cannot get warm. To add to his troubles, Ingleby had no proper mittens, and when the one extemporized from a strip of flour-bag burst, the hand with which he clutched the pack-straps split at every finger joint and at that temperature a sore will rarely heal.|$|R
25|$|A {{large number}} {{of plant and animal}} species of {{interest}} occur within the site, including most of the native Irish mammal species, several important fish species including <b>Arctic</b> <b>char,</b> and a range of rare or scarce plant species. Several of the animal and plant species in the park have a hiberno-lusitanean distribution, meaning that they only occur in southwest Ireland, northern Spain, and Portugal. The main reason for this is the effect of the Gulf Stream on southwest Ireland's climate. The park has been designated a biosphere reserve {{because of the presence of}} such rare species.|$|E
25|$|Other {{than the}} burbot and {{northern}} pike, {{most of the}} large fish found in Yukon rivers, lakes and streams are salmonids. Four species of Pacific salmon (Chinook, sockeye, coho and chum) breed in Yukon rivers and lakes in the Pacific and Yukon River watersheds. The Yukon River has the longest freshwater migration route of any salmon; Chinook salmon swim over 3,000 kilometres from its mouth in the Bering Sea to spawning grounds upstream of Whitehorse. There are also land-locked kokanee (sockeye salmon) and rainbow trout. chars are represented by lake trout present in most large Yukon lakes, as well as Dolly Varden, bull trout and <b>Arctic</b> <b>char.</b> The Arctic grayling is ubiquitous, while the lakes have various whitefish and inconnu.|$|E
25|$|Many sea louse {{species are}} {{specific}} {{with regard to}} host genera, for example L. salmonis which has high specificity for salmonids, including the widely farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Lepeophtheirus salmonis can parasitize other salmonids to varying degrees, including brown trout (sea trout: Salmo trutta), <b>Arctic</b> <b>char</b> (Salvelinus alpinus), and all species of Pacific salmon. In the case of Pacific salmon, coho, chum, and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch, O. keta, and O. gorbuscha, respectively) mount strong tissue responses to attaching L. salmonis, which lead to rejection within {{the first week of}} infection. Pacific L. salmonis can also develop, but not complete, its full life cycle on the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). This has not been observed with Atlantic L. salmonis.|$|E
25|$|The lakes contain <b>Arctic</b> <b>char</b> (Salvelinus alpinus L.), {{which is}} usually found much further north in sub-Arctic lakes. It's a relict species {{left behind in the}} area after the last Ice Age, and are {{consequently}} indicative of pristine environmental conditions. Although they were once widespread, they now are confined to isolated populations in inland freshwater lakes that have a suitable habitat. They are isolated in their respective lakes since the last Ice age. They are extremely sensitive to environmental changes when they are as far south as Ireland, where they are at the southern edge of their species range. The greatest threats to their survival in Ireland are introduced fish species, eutrophication, acidification and climate change. The rate of extinction of entire populations in Ireland has increased in recent decades.|$|E
500|$|Aquarium {{outreach}} programs include {{the community as}} a whole. [...] A notable example is the Serve & Protect program, which educates the public about sustainable seafood. It was established in 2011 in partnership with chef and television personality Alton Brown, an advocate of sustainable fisheries, who visited Chattanooga for events in 2011 and 2012. [...] Serve & Protect activities, including cooking demonstrations, cook-offs and dinners, are designed to encourage visitors and participants to consume sustainable seafood such as catfish, squid, <b>arctic</b> <b>char</b> and summer flounder, as a way of removing pressure from threatened fisheries. [...] The Aquarium also participates in the AZA's SAFE (Saving Animals From Extinction) program, focusing on shark conservation.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{suspected}} faulty welds were in Section Five {{of the pipeline}} construction project—the northernmost [...] This area also included two of the major problems encountered during the 1976 construction season: Atigun Pass and the Sagavanirktok River (also known as Sag River). The pipeline had been laid in a trench beneath the river in the late fall of 1975. Because it had been laid so late in the season, the trench fill material had frozen and {{it was impossible to}} fill the submerged trench containing the pipeline. Spring snowmelt flooded the river and battered the submerged portion of pipe. In June, the battered pipeline broke free of its moorings and a 1,700-foot (518 m) section of concrete-coated pipe floated {{to the surface of the}} river. Because doing repair work would interfere with the migration of <b>Arctic</b> <b>char,</b> the Alaska Department of Fish and Game allowed only 24 hours for the project. After preparing the site, it took just four hours for a replacement trench to be dug, a pipe welded and laid in the trench, and the trench to be filled in.|$|E
2500|$|Services {{of water}} {{treatment}} stations {{have been established}} in Savoy and in particular to Aix-les-Bains. Rivers such as the [...] and the [...] have thus been remediated, improving upon {{the quality of the}} waters of the lake and the regeneration of aquatic species. Aix-les-Bains has a public aquarium for the conservation of local species such as trout, <b>Arctic</b> <b>char</b> and carp. This establishment mainly specialises in freshwater fish. The [...] allows not only to help the local wildlife conservation but also for prevention work and educational visits.|$|E
2500|$|The {{brook trout}} was first scientifically {{described}} as Salmo fontinalis by the naturalist Samuel Latham Mitchill in 1814. The specific epithet [...] "fontinalis" [...] {{comes from the}} Latin for [...] "of a spring or fountain", {{in reference to the}} clear, cold streams and ponds in its native habitat. The species was later moved to the char genus Salvelinus. Though commonly called a trout, the brook trout is thus actually one of the chars, which in North America also include the lake trout, bull trout, Dolly Varden, and the <b>Arctic</b> <b>char.</b>|$|E
