Within four days, there were over 50 potential buyers, which led to fears from residents that the island's identity would be lost if it was bought by the wrong owner. In September 2008 {{it was announced that}} Starboard Settlement, a trust, had acquired the remainder of the lease for considerably less than the <b>asking</b> <b>price.</b> The trust formed a company based in Guernsey, Herm Island Ltd, to manage the island for the trustees.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the death}} of Kempelen, the Turk {{remained}} unexhibited until some time before 1804 when Kempelen's son decided {{to sell it to}} Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a Bavarian musician with an interest in various machines and devices. Mälzel, whose successes included patenting a form of metronome, had tried to purchase the Turk once before, before Kempelen's death. The original attempt had failed, owing to Kempelen's <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> of 20,000 francs; Kempelen's son sold the machine to Mälzel for half this sum.|$|E

30|$|Since {{constants}} {{come out}} of the infima of expectations, Madan (2016) shows that one may write the bid price as the expected value under a base probability less the <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> for the negative of the centered or demeaned cash flow. One may then also view the bid price as measuring reward by the expectation under the base probability less a risk measure given by the <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> for the negative of the centered cash flow. Since the centered negative cash flow has a zero mean by construction, and as the base probability is one of the test probabilities, the <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> is always positive and can be minimized subject to attaining a particular expectation. This naturally leads us to a mean <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> frontier and examples of such constructions may be found in Madan (2016). Here we consider the mean <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> frontier for the two-period portfolio problem.|$|R
5|$|The panels were {{included}} in the Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings, which included another important van Eyck work, the 1434–1436 Annunciation. They were purchased by Charles Henschel of New York art dealer M. Knoedler & Company for $185,000, significantly less than the <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> of $600,000 when the works were offered in 1931. The panels were shipped from Saint Petersburg to the Matthiesen Gallery in Berlin before M. Knoedler & Company sold them on to the Metropolitan in New York that year.|$|E

On average the huts measure around five by three metres, have no running water, and the occupants may only stay overnight from March to October. Despite the relative lack of amenities, the area {{has become one of the}} UK's most desirable; huts are rented out for up to £600 a week.|$|E
5|$|A 1935 {{article in}} the Montreal Gazette, meanwhile, stated that the {{original}} September Morn had yet {{to go to the}} United States, and that Chabas had sold it directly to Mantashev. According to Chabas, this was after an American approached him to purchase the painting, but was unwilling to pay the <b>asking</b> <b>price.</b> In her memoirs, Vogue editor Edna Woolman Chase recounted how Ortiz had arranged for numerous reproductions to be made and sent to New York, and that– although he had been interested in acquiring the original– he had been unable to do so.

5000|$|Layering is a {{strategy}} in high-frequency trading where a trader makes and then cancels orders that they never intend to have executed in hopes of influencing the stock price. For instance, to buy stock at a lower price, the trader initially places orders to sell {{at or above the}} market <b>ask</b> <b>price.</b> This may cause the market's best <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> to fall as other market participants lower their <b>asking</b> <b>prices</b> because they perceive selling pressure as they see the sell orders being entered on the order book. The trader may place subsequent sell orders for the security at successively lower prices as the best <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> falls (to increase the appearance of selling interest). After the price has fallen sufficiently, the trader makes a real trade, buying the stock at the now lower best <b>ask</b> <b>price,</b> and cancels all the sell orders. [...] It is considered a form of stock market manipulation.|$|R

5|$|After {{negotiations}} with Mančevski fell through, Mark Rydell was contracted {{to direct the}} biopic in February 1996. Rydell was also close friends with Dean; the two studied together at Actors Studio in Manhattan, New York during the early 1950s. DiCaprio {{dropped out of the}} lead role entirely when his <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> was determined to be too high after the actor's success with Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Titanic (1997). Meanwhile, Rydell worked with Horovitz on another rewrite, and Warner Bros. planned to fast track production. Don Was was hired to write and compose the film score, but he was later replaced by John Frizzell. Shortly after Rydell's hiring, Stephen Dorff entered discussions to portray James Dean. Ethan Hawke would later turn down the role.|$|E
5|$|As {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Hamhuis would not be re-signed by the Predators following the 2009–10 season, his negotiating rights were traded to the Philadelphia Flyers, along with a 2011 conditional draft pick, for Ryan Parent on June 19, 2010. Hamhuis and the Predators had been negotiating for most of the season, {{as well as in the}} summer, but Nashville was not willing to meet his <b>asking</b> <b>price.</b> After failing to agree to a contract with Philadelphia as well, his rights were traded once again to the Pittsburgh Penguins for a 2011 third-round pick on June 25; negotiations with the club were also unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|By 1982, the Old Strathcona Foundation was {{confident}} {{enough in the}} theatre’s prospects to purchase the building outright from Towne Cinema. By this time, the <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> for the building had dropped to $425,000, which {{was estimated to be}} $8000 below its real market value. The Foundation began to make major upgrades and repairs to the interior of the building. A fundraising drive in 1987 allowed 422 modern sized plush seats to be installed, lowering the theatre’s original seating capacity by almost 240. In 1989, a soundproofed cry room was installed with an independent sound system, allowing patrons with small children to come to films without worry.|$|E
30|$|Markets {{are also}} viewed as {{willing to sell}} random cash flows if the {{resulting}} price less the cash flow is market acceptable. Positivity of expectations under test probabilities renders the best <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> to be the supremum of expectations across test probabilities.

5|$|In September 1998 Manchester United {{were the}} target of a {{proposed}} takeover by British Sky Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Negotiations between both sides had begun during the summer, but had stalled after disagreements over the <b>asking</b> <b>price.</b> The satellite group’s original bid of £575million – initially thought to be their final offer – was deemed too low by two members of United’s board (chairman Martin Edwards and Professor Sir Roland Smith), who pressed for a higher figure. Two days of talks followed and in an attempt to close the deal, BSkyB made a final bid of £623.4million.|$|E
5|$|When Minnie {{decided to}} take up {{painting}} in 2000 while she waited for her daughter Barbara to complete a canvas in an Adelaide workshop, the reception was immediately positive: she had her first solo exhibition that same year at Melbourne's Flinders Lane Gallery. She was first selected to exhibit in the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2002. One of her pieces, Awelye Atnwengerrp, was exhibited in the 2003 Award, in which her name was given as Minnie Motorcar Apwerl (Pwerle). The artist's <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> for the picture, A$44,000, was the second-highest in the exhibition and the highest for an artist from the central and western deserts. Her painting Awelye Atnwengerrp 2 was exhibited in the 2005 competition.|$|E
5|$|Cope {{sold his}} {{collections}} to the American Museum of Natural History in 1895; his set of 10,000American fossil mammals sold for $32,000, lower than Cope's <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> of $50,000. The purchase was {{financed by the}} donations from New York's high society. Cope sold three other collections for $29,000. While his collection contained more than 13,000specimens, Cope's fossil hoard was still much smaller than Marsh's collection, valued at over a milliondollars. The University of Pennsylvania bought part of Cope's ethnological artifact collection for $5,500. The Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia's foremost museum, did not bid on any of Cope's sales due to bad blood between Cope and the museum's leaders; as a result, many of Cope's major finds left the city. Cope's proceeds from the sales allowed him to rehire Sternberg to prospect for fossils on his behalf.|$|E
50|$|A {{potential}} buyer bids a specific {{price for a}} stock, and a potential seller <b>asks</b> a specific <b>price</b> for the same stock. Buying or selling at the market means you will accept any <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> or bid price for the stock.

5|$|During the off-season, Philadelphia {{planned to}} trade or sell Lavender, {{even though he}} had earlier {{announced}} his retirement from the game. Philadelphia's <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> for his rights was $1,000, but they received no offers. Christy Mathewson, manager of the Reds, was reported to have had interest in Lavender, the pitcher's success against the Giants still fresh in Mathewson's mind. Though Philadelphia had a meeting with Cincinnati, Mathewson was unable to attend, and no trade discussions materialized. The San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League expressed interest in Lavender, but he stressed that he was retired and that he would only consider a trade to Atlanta of the Southern Association so that he could be near his farm in Montezuma. In 1922, it was reported that he signed with Atlanta after playing well for an independent team in Dawson, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Potts was poorly {{received}} by critics. Etty's admirers were angered by his apparent abandonment of history painting for the then poorly regarded field of portrait painting, while Etty's critics {{felt he had}} demonstrated {{that he did not}} have the technical skills to produce high quality portraits, and was simply trying to use his name to make money in the more lucrative field of portraiture. History paintings were generally sold at exhibition for no less than the <b>asking</b> <b>price,</b> and as a consequence often remained unsold. Portraits were commissioned by the subject or their family, providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist. History painting was much more highly regarded as an art form; portrait painting was seen as reflecting nature whereas history painting involved more creativity and also gave the artist the opportunity to tell moral lessons.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to {{the board}} {{a few days after}} the Munich air disaster, Louis Edwards, a friend of Matt Busby, began {{acquiring}} shares in the club; for an investment of approximately £40,000, he accumulated a 54percent shareholding and took control in January 1964. When Lillian Gibson died in January 1971, her shares passed to Alan Gibson who sold a percentage of his shares to Louis Edwards' son, Martin, in 1978; Martin Edwards went on to become chairman upon his father's death in 1980. Media tycoon Robert Maxwell attempted to buy the club in 1984, but did not meet Edwards' <b>asking</b> <b>price.</b> In 1989, chairman Martin Edwards attempted to sell the club to Michael Knighton for £20million, but the sale fell through and Knighton joined the Board of Directors instead.|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{transparency}} in the Italian {{real estate market}} means that many analyses should {{be carried out by}} utilizing <b>asking</b> <b>prices</b> which should also be used by the industry for estimative purposes.

He made his debut in 3–1 win over Astra Ploiești on 17 August 2002, and scored {{only once in}} 13 {{appearances}} for a Craiova team that ranked seventh in the 2002–03 Divizia A table. However, the players' wages were continually paid late throughout the season and McBreen came close to a move to Norwegian Tippeligaen club Lillestrøm, only for Craiova to twice raise their <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> for him on transfer deadline day. He played more regularly the next season, making 20 appearances and scoring twice as Craiova finished fourth in the 2003–04 Divizia A table. He finally left Craiova {{during the summer of}} 2004 after the club's president Pavel Badea, a former teammate of McBreen's at the club, signed a letter releasing him from his contract. He took his case to FIFA and the Court of Arbitration for Sport with the help of Professional Footballers Australia, and only received the money he was owed after the club was given a three-point deduction and was threatened with automatic relegation.|$|E

5|$|Ownership of the {{continuous}} park blocks {{was not without}} dispute, however. After Lownsdale died without a will, and then his wife Nancy died, his estate challenged that his plat didn't require the central section to be dedicated to public use since Nancy had not signed over legal title to the land. The courts agreed in 1865. Benjamin Stark reneged on the donation of two north central park blocks to the city, instead offering to sell them for $138,000. Captain John H. Couch deeded his section, which became the North Park Blocks to the city on January 25, 1865, only ten days after receiving the federal patent for the land. Six of the South Park Blocks were lost to private parties in the 1870s, and elected city officials were unwilling to spend the <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> of $6,000 per block to purchase them so soon after the city had bought the land for Washington Park. Only a year later, a proposal to acquire the six blocks for $92,000 was brought by the city council, showing the increase in prices in that year.|$|E
