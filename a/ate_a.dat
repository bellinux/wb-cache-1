5|$|The Russian {{imperial}} {{family was}} a frequent target for assassins, so for safety reasons the Grand Duchess was raised at the country palace of Gatchina, about 50miles (80km) west of Saint Petersburg. Olga and her siblings, however, were not accustomed to a lavish early lifestyle. Conditions in the nursery were modest, even Spartan. They slept on hard camp beds, rose at dawn, washed in cold water, and <b>ate</b> <b>a</b> simple porridge for breakfast.|$|E
5|$|The {{sandwich}} has {{close ties}} to New England, particularly to Somerville, Massachusetts, where Archibald Query invented Marshmallow Fluff, and to Lynn, Massachusetts, where Durkee-Mower has produced it for decades. Somerville holds an annual festival called What the Fluff? based around celebrating Marshmallow Fluff and Fluffernutter sandwiches. The festival incorporates music, visual art, games and a cooking contest based around Fluff and Fluffernutters. In 2011, NASA astronaut Richard Michael Linnehan, {{who was born in}} Lowell, Massachusetts, and <b>ate</b> <b>a</b> Fluffernutter while aboard the International Space Station, acted as one of the contest judges.|$|E
5|$|When {{they were}} first cultivated, carrots were grown for their {{aromatic}} leaves and seeds rather than their roots. Carrot seeds {{have been found in}} Switzerland and Southern Germany dating back to 2000–3000 BC. Some close relatives of the carrot are still grown for their leaves and seeds, such as parsley, cilantro, coriander, fennel, anise, dill and cumin. The first mention of the root in classical sources is from the 1st century; the Romans <b>ate</b> <b>a</b> root vegetable called pastinaca, which may have been either the carrot or the closely related parsnip.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the War of the First Coalition Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army. With {{military}} rations unable to satisfy his large appetite, he would eat any available food from gutters and refuse heaps but his condition still deteriorated through hunger. Suffering from exhaustion, he was hospitalised and became the subject of a series of medical experiments to test his eating capacity, in which, among other things, he <b>ate</b> <b>a</b> meal intended for 15 people in a single sitting, ate live cats, snakes, lizards and puppies, and swallowed an eel whole without chewing. Despite his unusual diet, he was of normal size and appearance, and showed no signs of mental illness other than what was described as an apathetic temperament.|$|E
5|$|Henry campaigned {{throughout}} the autumn, strengthening the southern frontier, and then travelled to Lyons-la-Forêt in November to enjoy some hunting, still apparently healthy. There Henry fell ill– {{according to the}} chronicler Henry of Huntingdon, he <b>ate</b> <b>a</b> number of lampreys against his physician's advice– and his condition worsened {{over the course of}} a week. Once the condition appeared terminal, Henry gave confession and summoned Archbishop Hugh of Amiens, who was joined by Robert of Gloucester and other members of the court. In accordance with custom, preparations were made to settle Henry's outstanding debts and to revoke outstanding sentences of forfeiture. The King died on 1 December 1135, and his corpse was taken to Rouen accompanied by the barons, where it was embalmed; his entrails were buried locally at Port-du-Salut Abbey, and the preserved body was taken on to England, where it was interred at Reading Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Not {{much had}} {{changed by the}} 1960s. The day began with a waking bell at 6:45am. After a {{prisoner}} count, they moved into the yard until 7:30, when they collected breakfast {{and headed back to}} their cells. The 8:00 bell signaled a parade, and then the start of work, which lasted until 11:15. They <b>ate</b> <b>a</b> meal, locked in their cells until 12:20pm, followed by some time in the yards. At 1:00 there was another parade, and another session of work which lasted to 4:15. Another meal was collected, and prisoners were locked away in their cells overnight. The lights stayed on until 9:30pm. On the weekends the routine featured no work, and included a film played for the prisoners.|$|E

5000|$|The subjunctive mood, {{sometimes}} called conjunctive mood, has several uses in dependent clauses. Examples include discussing hypothetical or unlikely events, expressing opinions or emotions, or making polite requests (the exact scope is language-specific). A subjunctive mood exists in English, but {{it often is}} not obligatory. Example: [...] "I suggested that Paul <b>eat</b> <b>an</b> apple", Paul is not in fact <b>eating</b> <b>an</b> apple. Contrast this with the sentence [...] "Paul <b>eats</b> <b>an</b> apple", where the verb [...] "to eat" [...] is in the present tense, indicative mood. Another way, especially in British English, of expressing this might be [...] "I suggested that Paul should <b>eat</b> <b>an</b> apple", derived from [...] "Paul should <b>eat</b> <b>an</b> apple." ...|$|R

25|$|On July 23, 1988, Rick Gibson ate {{the flesh}} of another person in public. Because England {{does not have a}} {{specific}} law against cannibalism, he legally <b>ate</b> <b>a</b> canapé of donated human tonsils in Walthamstow High Street, London. A year later, on April 15, 1989, he publicly <b>ate</b> <b>a</b> slice of human testicle in Lewisham High Street, London. When he tried to eat another slice of human testicle at the Pitt International Galleries in Vancouver on July 14, 1989, the Vancouver police confiscated the testicle hors d'œuvre. However, the charge of publicly exhibiting a disgusting object was dropped and he finally ate the piece of human testicle {{on the steps of the}} Vancouver court house on September 22, 1989.|$|E
25|$|The {{religions}} of Chinese Buddhism and Taoism {{require that}} monks and nuns eat an egg free, onion free vegetarian diet. Since abbeys were usually self-sufficient, in practice this meant they <b>ate</b> <b>a</b> vegan diet. Many religious orders also avoid hurting plant life by avoiding root vegetables. This {{is not just}} seen as an ascetic practice, but Chinese spirituality generally believes that animals have immortal souls, and that a diet of mostly grain is the healthiest for humans.|$|E

50|$|Very informally, causal {{decision}} theory advises decision makers {{to make the}} decision with the best expected causal consequences. The basic idea is simple enough: if <b>eating</b> <b>an</b> apple will cause you to be happy and <b>eating</b> <b>an</b> orange will cause you to be sad then you would be rational to eat the apple. One complication is the notion of expected causal consequences. Imagine that <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> good apple will cause you to be happy and <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> bad apple will cause you to be sad but you aren't sure if the apple is good or bad. In this case you don't know the causal effects of eating the apple. Instead, then, you work from the expected causal effects, where these will depend on three things: (1) how likely you think the apple is to be good and how likely you think it is to be bad; (2) how happy <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> good apple makes you; and (3) how sad <b>eating</b> <b>a</b> bad apple makes you. In informal terms, causal {{decision theory}} advises the agent {{to make the decision}} with the best expected causal effects.|$|R

25|$|The partitive–indefinite pro-clitic re is {{used when}} the NP {{refers to a}} new, {{non-specific}} instance of a notion. In order to understand this concept, compare the English sentences 'I <b>ate</b> <b>a</b> banana ' with 'I want to eat a banana '. Besides being indefinite in both cases, in the first sentence a banana is specific, because it refers to a specific banana; in the second sentence a banana is non-specific, because it can refer to any banana, not one in particular. Although this semantic difference is not grammaticalized in English, it is in Araki, using re as a marker for non-specific indefinite reference.|$|E
25|$|Work by Helen Leach {{shows that}} Māori were using about 36 {{different}} food plants, although many required detoxification and long periods (12–24 hours) of cooking. D. Sutton's research on early Māori fertility found that first pregnancy occurred at about 20 {{years and the}} mean number of births was low, compared with other neolithic societies. The low number of births may have been due to the very low average life expectancy of 31–32 years. Analysis of skeletons at Wairau Bar showed signs of a hard life, with many having had broken bones that had healed. This suggests that the people <b>ate</b> <b>a</b> balanced diet and enjoyed a supportive community that had the resources to support severely injured family members.|$|E
25|$|Monster Eats Machine (October 8, 1967) – A {{prototype}} {{version of}} Cookie Monster (performed by Jim Henson) finds a talking machine (voiced by Jim Henson) and eats {{it while it}} explains its various parts. After the monster is done eating the machine, its voice is heard from within the monster as it states that nothing can stop it from performing its function {{which is to be}} the most powerful exploding device known to man. On a related note with this sketch, the prototype version of Cookie Monster was previously used as the Wheel-Stealer from the commercial for Wheels, Crowns, and Flutes. The sketch later appeared on The Muppet Show where the Luncheon Counter Monster also <b>ate</b> <b>a</b> machine explaining its functions.|$|E
