Her coronation as queen of Hungary took place in St. Martin's Cathedral, Pressburg on 25 June 1741 after she had spent months honing the equestrian skills necessary for the ceremony and negotiating with the Diet.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff's {{first ground}} was at Sophia Gardens {{recreational}} park where they played from their founding in 1899 until 1910 when, {{due to the}} lack of facilities at the ground and the increasing <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the club, Bartley Wilson contacted Bute Estate, who owned large amounts of Cardiff at the time, in an attempt to find land suitable for building a stadium. They eventually agreed on an area of waste ground on Sloper Road. The land was a former rubbish tip and required extensive work to get a playable surface, but with the assistance of Cardiff Corporation and volunteers the work was completed. The ground was originally to be known as Sloper Park but was instead named after Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart, who was a large force in helping the club get the ground built, and became Ninian Park. The ground hosted its first match on 1 September 1910 with a friendly against Aston Villa, with the kick-off being performed by Lord Crichton-Stuart.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the support}} that Zbor {{received}} in Serbia came {{from members of the}} urban middle class, as well as right-wing students and members of the armed forces. The majority of Zbor's members were ethnic Serbs, though some Croats and Slovenes also joined. Its membership fluctuated often, primarily due to disagreements over Ljotić's authoritarianism and his lack of popularity and political power in Serbia. Ljotić was an unpopular figure in Serbia due to his pro-German sympathies and religious fanaticism. The limited <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> received by Zbor itself stemmed from the fact that radical right-wing sentiment was not strong amongst the Serbian population. The reason for this was that right-wing politics were associated with Germany. Being extremely anti-German, the majority of ethnic Serbs rejected fascist and Nazi ideas outright. Zbor never had more than 10,000 active members at any given time, with most of its support coming from Smederevo and from the ethnic German (Volksdeutsche) minority in Vojvodina that had been exposed to Nazi propaganda since 1933.|$|E

By the 23rd, the National Congress had begun discussing the possibility of a general amnesty for the sailors.

5|$|Casting Crowns {{was formed}} in 1999 by Mark Hall (lead vocals), Hector Cervantes (guitar, vocals), Juan DeVevo (guitar, vocals), and Melodee DeVevo (violin, vocals) as a student worship band. The band is {{originally}} from Daytona Beach, Florida but relocated to Eagle's Landing First Baptist Church in McDonough, Georgia in 2001, where they recruited Megan Garrett (piano/vocals), Andy Williams (drums), and Chris Huffman (bass guitar) as members. One of their independent records was discovered by Mark A. Miller, the lead vocalist for country band Sawyer Brown. Although Casting Crowns had not released their independent records with intentions of receiving a record deal, Miller offered the band {{the opportunity to become}} the first artists signed to his record label. The band agreed to join and signed with the as-yet-unnamed record label, an imprint of Provident Label Group, and began work on their debut album. As a group, Casting Crowns was unusual in several ways, such as having seven members, never having toured before, and their producer (Miller) having no history in the Christian music industry. However, Christian singer and songwriter Steven Curtis Chapman was brought in to co-produce the album with Miller, giving the project a greater <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> in the Christian music industry. Terry Hemmings, Provident Label Group CEO/President and a personal friend of Miller, openly predicted success for Casting Crowns and made them one of his top priorities at the label. While most artists in a similar situation would have received nine months for artist development, Hemmings gave the band four months and sped up the album's release. Casting Crowns was recorded at Glow in the Dark Studio in Decatur, Georgia and Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee. The album was engineered by Matt Goldman and Sam Hewitt.|$|E

40|$|The second U. S. Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics [PSED II] has {{identified}} {{a cohort of}} nascent enterprises in the earliest stages of the business creation process. They are identified after the first efforts to create a business have been initiated but before the new venture has an initial period <b>of</b> profitability. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> informal financial <b>support</b> provided to these new ventures before they have been registered as a legal entity is separated from formal equity and debt provided after this event. The average <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> informal <b>support</b> is $ 48 thousand, but the skewed nature of the distribution is represented by a median of $ 4. 3 thousand. The average <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> formal financial <b>support</b> is about $ 200 thousand, but the median is zero. There are some statistically significant differences related to the sources of informal and formal financial support {{and the status of}} the new ventures in the 12 and 24 month follow-up interviews, but no clear relationship to the <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> Nascent enterprises still in the start-up process have higher <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> informal and formal financial support than those reporting an initial period of profitability. The annual <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> informal <b>support</b> for 6 million nascent enterprises is about $ 102 billion dollars; the annual <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> formal <b>support</b> is about $ 145 billion; the majority of this funding is provided to ventures continuing the start-up process, not those with initial periods of profitability...|$|R

40|$|The {{structural}} {{evolution of}} two Pt/ceria–zirconia catalysts, characterized by different <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>supported</b> Pt, was monitored by in situ X-ray diffraction during the anaerobic oxidation of CO at different temperatures.

25|$|Some {{supporters}} of Taiwan independence, including former president Lee Teng-hui, {{have called for}} the abandonment of the flag, {{and there are a}} number of alternate designs for a specifically Taiwanese flag.

While this may not be positive for all patients, this is beneficial for those patients who may be elderly or have minimal energy to expend in therapy-type settings.
