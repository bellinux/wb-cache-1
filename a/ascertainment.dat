The purpose of these works is to receive a full picture of the significance site by confronting the archaeological sources with the historical, Cartographical ones and with the. architectonical <b>ascertainments.</b> The first stage of research covers {{the investigation of the}} medieval town, i. e. present Old Town. The former investigations were concentrated within the Old Market, where the gothic church of St. John, built in 1538, is situated. They aimed at stating whether this church - according to the accepted M.

In a course of the excavations carried out. in the ditches running along the Southern wall of an apse and along the northern wall of the church between the aisle and sacristy no remains of the earlier wall of stones or bricks were rövealed. Moreover, the finds gained during the iarchaeological works in the Old Market allow one to date the beginnings of local habitation to the late 13 th and 14 th century. After having confronted the above <b>ascertainments</b> with the written sources one can suppose that the earlier St. John's church must have been situated closer to the stronghold, i. e. on the area of the earlier habitation datable» prior to the 13 th century.

500|$|The next type of uncertainty, ascertainability, {{is where}} it is {{impossible}} to find the beneficiaries, either because they have died, moved or changed names. This is not necessarily fatal; the test for deciding if it is or not was laid out by Wynn-Parry J as: [...] "mere difficulty of <b>ascertainment</b> is not of itself fatal to the validity of the gift. As has been pointed out, {{it is a matter of}} degree, and it is only when one reaches, on the evidence, a conclusion that it is so vague or that the difficulty is so great that it must be treated as virtually incapable of resolution, that one is entitled, to my mind, to say that a gift of that nature is void for uncertainty". If a beneficiary cannot be found despite strenuous steps to find one, the trustees can apply for a Benjamin Order, named after the case of Re Benjamin, which authorises them to distribute the property as if the beneficiary is dead. The final type of uncertainty is administrative unworkability — where the trust is, by its very nature, so impractical that the trustees cannot carry out their duties. Where this prevents the trustees carrying out their duties, the trust will be declared invalid, and not applied.|$|E
500|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} {{was once}} thought to be rare: in 1972, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) believed there were fewer than 100 cases in the United States, and a 1973 registry reported only 485 cases worldwide. However, multiple studies published since 2000 have consistently demonstrated that the prevalence is much higher than previously thought. Discrepancies across current and prior prevalence estimates come from several factors: [...] <b>ascertainment</b> bias in earlier samples drawn from clinically referred cases, assessment methods that may fail to detect milder cases, and differences in diagnostic criteria and thresholds. There were few broad-based community studies published before 2000 and until the 1980s, most epidemiological studies of Tourette syndrome were based on individuals referred to tertiary care or specialty clinics. Individuals with mild symptoms may not seek treatment and physicians may not confer an official diagnosis of TS on children out of concern for stigmatization; children with milder symptoms are unlikely to be referred to specialty clinics, so prevalence studies have an inherent bias towards more severe cases. Studies of Tourette syndrome are vulnerable to error because tics vary in intensity and expression, are often intermittent, and are not always recognized by clinicians, patients, family members, friends or teachers; approximately 20% of persons with Tourette syndrome do not recognize that they have tics. Newer studies—recognizing that tics may often be undiagnosed and hard to detect—use direct classroom observation and multiple informants (parent, teacher, and trained observers), and therefore record more cases than older studies relying on referrals. As the diagnostic threshold and assessment methodology have moved towards recognition of milder cases, the result is an increase in estimated prevalence.|$|E

40|$|Two-phase {{stratified}} sampling designs {{can reduce}} the cost of genetic epidemiologic studies by limiting expensive <b>ascertainments</b> of genetic and environmental exposure to an efficiently selected subsample (phase II) of the main study (phase I). Family history and some covariate information, which may be cheaply gathered for all subjects at phase I, can be used for sampling of informative subjects at phase II. We develop alternative maximum likelihood methods for analysis of data from such studies by using a novel regression model that permits the estimation of 'marginal' risk parameters that are associated with the genetic and environmental covariates of interest, while simultaneously characterizing the 'conditional' risk of the disease associated with family history after adjusting for the other covariates. The methods and appropriate asymptotic theories are developed with and without an assumption of gene-environment independence, allowing the distribution of the environmental factors to remain non-parametric. The performance of the alternative methods and of sampling strategies is studied by using simulated data involving rare and common genetic variants. An application of the methods proposed is illustrated by using a case-control study of colorectal adenoma embedded within the prostate, lung, colorectal and ovarian cancer screening trial.
