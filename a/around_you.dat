25|$|Arthur Spiderwick– The {{author of}} Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World <b>Around</b> <b>You.</b> He {{worked as a}} {{publicity}} artist and spent many years researching faeries by doing field work and by contacting other researchers (for example, for his entries on dragons and giants). His Field Guide eventually made him {{be seen as a}} threat by the elves, who ordered him to destroy it and imprisoned him for 80 years when he refused. Much like the Irish hero Oisín, who spent hundreds of years in the faerie world, Spiderwick also dies when he steps on the ground after being kept alive for more years than he was supposed to live.|$|E
25|$|If the {{immediate}} international situation {{is used as}} an excuse to get us to drop our opposition to the rearmament programme of the Government, the next phase must be that we must desist from any industrial or political action that may disturb national unity in the face of Fascist aggression. Along that road is endless retreat, {{and at the end of}} it a voluntary totalitarian State with ourselves erecting the barbed wire <b>around.</b> <b>You</b> cannot collaborate, you cannot accept the logic of collaboration on a first class issue like rearmament, and at the same time evade the implications of collaboration all along the line when the occasion demands it.|$|E
25|$|The Spiderwick Chronicles is {{a series}} of children's books by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black. They chronicle the adventures of the Grace children, twins Simon and Jared and their older sister Mallory, after they move into the Spiderwick Estate and {{discover}} a world of fairies that they never knew existed.

25|$|Korea – as {{a platoon}} leader. Recon leader. What {{is the job}} of a recon leader? To recon the front line – no man’s land. And what did we do? I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And what is this Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and write. You said, no combat experience, no combat experience. Look <b>around</b> <b>you</b> who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, I never had an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not allow yourself to destroy the armed forces by those guys. You write about the majority of the Armed Forces who are on the job. That's why we're here enjoying our freedom, ladies and gentlemen. You are here. If the majority of the Armed Forces did not do their job, I doubt very much if you’d all be here.|$|E

500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Frank Borin, premiered on Yahoo! Music on November 15, 2007. Later that day, {{it was also}} released to iTunes for digital download. According to the behind-the-scenes video, the song features the use of pyrotechnics all throughout the video. When asked about the idea behind the video, Wade said, [...] "The whole concept of this video and just stuff exploding and breaking with my performance to the camera; it's almost like my performance is trying to salvage a relationship together. The imagery of stuff breaking and falling apart; its almost like the whole world shattering <b>around</b> <b>you,</b> but you're {{trying to keep it}} alive." ...|$|E
500|$|According to AllMusic editor Alexey Eremenko, [...] "Rock'n'Roll Circus {{is pretty}} versatile: {{there are a}} couple of pop/rock tracks, a Middle Eastern techno tune, a playful plastic pop song, even a jungle interlude, and, of course, a slew of epic, string-drenched ballads that no J-pop singer seems to be able to resist performing". Greg from Selective Hearing stated that the album's {{material}} showed more [...] "restraint" [...] than her previous music; [...] "There is a deliberate pacing that entices the listener to stick <b>around.</b> <b>You</b> don't get hammered over the head". Asian Junkie editor Random J reviewed the album on his personal blog, and noticed the music and themes for Rock 'n' Roll Circus were more consistent than her previous albums. Tetsuo Hiraga from Hot Express noted the album's [...] "formulaic rock music".|$|E
500|$|In November2007, Usher {{hoped to}} release his fifth album, titled Here I Stand, but [...] "issues in his {{personal}} life" [...] delayed the album. According to reports, Usher has {{to spend more time}} with his then-pregnant wife. The expected November release date was booked to coincide with that of Usher's fragrance line. Released on May13,2008. The continually changing release dates became frustrating for Usher; Dupri said to Billboard, [...] "The last couple [...] times I've been <b>around</b> , <b>you</b> could tell he's got the bug to hurry up and put this record out. He wants to get back out here and give the people that. He's got that itch." [...] Here I Stand was first released by LaFace Records in Mexico and several European countries on May13,2008; releases in other countries followed.|$|E

500|$|In {{keeping with}} Homogenics theme {{as a tribute}} to Björk's native Iceland, the track was {{inspired}} by Icelandic mythology, such as the Ragnarök. The previous track, [...] "Pluto", stands for death and destruction, whereas [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] stands for a new beginning. Björk also called it a song about [...] "believing in love" [...] and expressed that [...] "love isn't just about two persons. It's everywhere <b>around</b> <b>you.</b> Even if you're not getting love from Person A, it doesn't mean there's not love there." [...] However, she also described it as [...] "taking the piss", considering it the most [...] "sugary song" [...] ever. As the song opposes the rest of Homogenics [...] "macho" [...] aesthethic, Björk has said it could have been included on Vespertine.|$|E
500|$|Melua {{opened up}} about the {{breakdown}} years later {{in an interview with}} The Independent, saying that it ended up being {{one of the best things}} that had ever happened to her, as she said it helped to squash a feeling of superiority she felt by being a successful musician in the music industry. [...] "....It was petrifying, but it put a stop to fantasies of being able to do anything. The oddest thing about this job is the sense of superiority you get. It was a huge wake-up call. I was completely out of it for two weeks, and in hospital for six. There was a bunch of things going on, things at home and crazy work schedules, and you really believe the world revolved <b>around</b> <b>you</b> and it doesn’t." ...|$|E
500|$|In the song, Spears and Madonna sing of {{the pleasures}} of letting go on the dancefloor, in lyrics such as [...] "I'm up against the speaker / Trying {{to take on the}} music / It's like a competition". Spears {{explained}} the concept of the song as [...] "basically about just going to a club and letting yourself go and battling with whoever is <b>around</b> <b>you</b> and battling against the music as well." [...] Magnet continued, saying, [...] "Like she was hearing the music and trying to out-dance the track or out-beat the drum or out-pluck the guitar. It's as if she's in the club, losing herself in the music." [...] William Shaw of Blender stated Madonna's verse could be interpreted as her passing the baton to a new talent, as well as [...] "a taunt from the old guard to the uptight youngster." ...|$|E
