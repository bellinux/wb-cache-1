5|$|Beaumont <b>almost</b> <b>instantly</b> {{became a}} boomtown with investors {{from around the}} state and the nation {{participating}} in land speculation. Investment in Texas speculation in 1901 reached approximately $235 million US (approximately $ in present-day terms). The level of oil speculation in Pennsylvania and other areas of the United States was quickly surpassed by the speculation in Texas. The Lucas gusher itself was short-lived; production fell to 10,000 barrels per day by 1904. The strike, however, was only the beginning of a much larger trend.|$|E
5|$|In {{the evening}} of 9 July 1917, Vanguards {{magazines}} exploded and she sank <b>almost</b> <b>instantly,</b> with only three survivors, one of whom died soon afterwards; 842 men aboard were lost. Collingwoods crew recovered the bodies of three men killed in the explosion. The Board of Inquiry concluded that a fire of unknown origin began in a 4-inch magazine and spread to {{one or both of}} the nearby 12-inch magazines, which detonated and sank the ship.|$|E

50|$|Once humans enter {{a natural}} {{environment}} that environment <b>almost</b> always <b>instantly</b> becomes changed. As humans we need certain resources and items to live. It {{is not uncommon}} to see an entire natural environment completely cleared or manipulated {{to make way for the}} development of residential, industrial, commercial or agricultural zones. Another threat posed by humans is the creation of busy interstate highways and roads that divide whole ecosystems in half and force many migratory land animals to change their migration routes.|$|R

5|$|The wound severed Sharp's aorta, {{killing him}} <b>almost</b> <b>instantly.</b> Sharp's wife Eliza {{witnessed}} the entire {{scene from the}} top of the stairs in the house, but Beauchamp fled before he could be identified or captured. Returning to the site where he had buried a change of clothes, he stripped off his disguise, tied it up with a rock, and sank them in the Kentucky River. In his regular clothes, he returned to his room at Scott's house, where he remained until the following morning.|$|E
5|$|Beginning November 1984, geologists {{observed}} {{an increasing}} level of seismic activity near Nevado del Ruiz. Other {{signs of a}} forthcoming eruption included increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and small phreatic eruptions. In the latter, hot magma came in contact with water, resulting in explosions as the water was <b>almost</b> <b>instantly</b> turned into steam. The most notable of these events was an ash ejection on September 11, 1985. The activity of the volcano decreased in October 1985. The most likely explanation of the events is that new magma rose into the volcanic edifice before September 1985.|$|E
5|$|Formation of {{the carbon}} atomic nucleus {{requires}} a nearly simultaneous triple collision of alpha particles (helium nuclei) within {{the core of a}} giant or supergiant star which is known as the triple-alpha process, as the products of further nuclear fusion reactions of helium with hydrogen or another helium nucleus produce lithium-5 and beryllium-8 respectively, both of which are highly unstable and decay <b>almost</b> <b>instantly</b> back into smaller nuclei. This happens in conditions of temperatures over 100 megakelvin and helium concentration that the rapid expansion and cooling of the early universe prohibited, and therefore no significant carbon was created during the Big Bang.|$|E
50|$|In the 1940s, FC Luzern {{became a}} typical second {{division}} club. In 1952-53 FCL again {{had a bad}} start to the campaign but improved significantly as the season progressed. Promotion could be secured in the final game against local rival SC Zug. The boom only lasted {{for two years and}} Luzern got relegated again in 1955. The club board appointed young German manager Rudi Gutendorf whose managerial career would later span the entire planet. While Gutendorf saw the first years as a consolidation period, the team <b>almost</b> got <b>instantly</b> promoted after just one year in the second division. Promotion eventually came in 1958.|$|R
50|$|Stoke then faced West Ham on 15 March {{looking to}} {{complete}} the double over the Hammers but made a poor start to the match with Andy Carroll heading in after just four minutes. Stephen Ireland <b>almost</b> responded <b>instantly</b> for Stoke, forcing Adrián into a diving save. Stoke levelled on 30 minutes after Ireland's corner was headed onto the crossbar by Crouch and his rebound deflected in off Odemwingie. In an eventful second period Kevin Nolan had a goal disallowed for West Ham before goals from Arnautović and a powerful strike from Odemwingie earned Stoke a 3-1 victory lifting them to 11th position.|$|R
60|$|Jackson, pulling up, wheeled {{round and}} {{was back at}} her side <b>instantly.</b> <b>Almost</b> {{at the same moment}} Dick Darvall came up, threw the mare almost on her haunches, leaped from the saddle, and ran to Mary. As he did so, the crash of a pistol shot at his ear almost {{deafened}} him, and a glance showed him that Jackson had shot his horse, which fell dead close to his daughter's pony.|$|R
5|$|The admirals, however, were {{reckoning}} {{without their}} sailors. The enlisted {{men of the}} High Seas Fleet, aware that Germany had lost the war, {{had no interest in}} dying {{for the sake of the}} Navy's honor. When the details of Plan 19 were leaked to the fleet, a mutiny <b>almost</b> <b>instantly</b> broke out, with sailors raising the red flag of revolution and refusing to obey their officers. Faced with a complete breakdown of discipline within his fleet, Admiral Hipper had no choice but to disperse his ships to their homeports in early November. Days later, on 11 November 1918, World War I came to an end.|$|E
5|$|Benchley re-entered Hollywood at {{the height}} of the Great Depression and the {{large-scale}} introduction of the talkie films he had begun working with years before. His arrival put him on the scene of a number of productions <b>almost</b> <b>instantly.</b> While Benchley was more interested in writing than acting, one of his more important roles as an actor was as a salesman in Rafter Romance, and his work attracted the interest of MGM, who offered Benchley a lot of money to complete a series of short films. Benchley, who had also been offered a syndicated column by Hearst, was able to film the shorts in New York and keep up with his new column. Before heading back to New York, Benchley took a role in the feature film Dancing Lady (1933), which also featured Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Fred Astaire, Nelson Eddy, and the Three Stooges.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} older French pre-dreadnoughts, Charlemagne escorted Allied troop convoys through the Mediterranean until November when she was ordered to the Dardanelles to guard against a sortie by Goeben. During the {{bombardment}} on 25 February 1915, the ship engaged the fort at Kum Kale with some effect. On 18 March, Charlemagne, together with , , and Gaulois, was to penetrate deep into the Dardanelles after six British battleships suppressed the defending Turkish fortifications and attack those same fortifications at close range. After the French ships were ordered to be relieved by six other British battleships, Bouvet struck a mine and sank <b>almost</b> <b>instantly</b> while Gaulois was hit twice, one of which opened a large hole in her hull that began to flood the ship. Charlemagne escorted Gaulois to the Rabbit Islands, north of Tenedos, where the latter ship could be beached for temporary repairs. Charlemagne herself was moderately damaged during the bombardment and continued onwards to Bizerte for repairs that lasted through May.|$|E

They <b>instantly,</b> <b>almost</b> resentfully, missed the Cicero's Offices that he had parted with, and joyfully hailed his new acquisitions, often sitting with heads together over the same book, reading like active-minded youths who were used to out-of-door life and exercise in superabundant measure, and to study as a valued recreation, with only food enough for the intellect to awaken instead of satisfying it.|$|R
60|$|Almost {{before the}} words were out of his mouth, before Lieutenant Maynard could turn, there came a loud and {{deafening}} crash, and then instantly another, and a third, and <b>almost</b> as <b>instantly</b> a crackling and rending of broken wood. There were clean yellow splinters flying everywhere. A man fell violently against the lieutenant, nearly overturning him, but he caught at the stays and so saved himself. For one tense moment he stood holding his breath. Then all about him arose a sudden outcry of groans and shouts and oaths. The man who had fallen against him was lying face down upon the deck. His thighs were quivering, and {{a pool of blood}} was spreading and running out from under him. There were other men down, all about the deck. Some were rising; some were trying to rise; some only moved.|$|R
40|$|In an {{asymmetric}} {{war of attrition}} the players` prize valuations are drawn from different distributions. A stochastic strength ordering, based upon relative hazard rates, is used to rank these distributions. The stochastically stronger player {{is perceived to be}} strong ex ante, even though her realized valuation may be lower ex post. Since the classic war of attrition exhibits multiple equilibria, the game is perturbed; for instance, by imposing an arbitrarily large time limit, or allowing for the arbitrarily small probability of players that are restricted to fighting forever.

5|$|Lieutenant du Plooy {{took his}} men {{around the bend}} behind cover, then sent his American medic, Corporal John Alan Coey of Columbus, Ohio, {{out into the open}} {{streambed}} to render medical assistance. Though his prominent Red Cross flag was clearly visible, the hidden cadres immediately opened fire on Coey, who was killed <b>almost</b> <b>instantly</b> by a shot through the head. His body fell at du Plooy's feet. The stand-off continued {{for the rest of the}} day, during which time du Plooy and one other RLI man were wounded. The security forces were only able to gather their dead for evacuation when darkness fell. During the night, the Rhodesians deployed stops in ambush positions around the insurgents' position to prevent an escape. When the guerrillas attempted to sneak through the security force perimeter in the early hours, they ran into Corporal Jannie de Beer's RLI men and a fire fight ensued; the nationalists shot de Beer dead and wounded one of his troopers as they broke through and quickly left the area. The morale of 2 Commando's men took a noticeable hit after this unsuccessful Fireforce in which the cadres had killed four Rhodesian soldiers and wounded four more.|$|E

The same former railroad line that was encountered near Harney Road is visible along the east side of US 301 throughout the park and beyond. The last moderate intersection US 301 encounters before finally entering the park is the northern terminus of McIntosh Road. One residential area can be found on a minor side road off to the left, {{but the rest of the}} road is surrounded by parkland.

5000|$|The {{attack was}} carried out by a three man Active Service Unit. At around 6.00pm two members of the unit opened fire in the bar with handguns before the third member of the unit ran in with the bomb, placed it were it would do most damage near the doorway, lit the fuse and then the unit ran out of the pub and drove away. The force of the {{explosion}} was massive and brought the roof crashing in on the customers. The bar was packed with people waiting to watch the Grand National horse race when the attack happened. The bar was known to be popular with Volunteers of the UVF. The getaway car used in the attack was found abandoned in the Springfield area: a stronghold for the PIRA. The five dead people were <b>almost</b> killed <b>instantly</b> and some of those injured had lost limbs. It took rescue services hours to free people from the rubble.|$|R

With unerring precision it settled about the creature's neck. There was a quick wrist movement of the thrower, the noose tightened. The Killer braced himself with the rope across his hip, and as the antelope tautened the singing strands in a last frantic bound for liberty he was thrown over upon his back.|$|R
50|$|Solid-state drives (SSD) are a newer form of {{data storage}} which is gaining in popularity. The more common and {{traditional}} {{hard disk drive}} (HDD) is still the more widely used, but many gaming enthusiasts are turning to SSDs {{in favor of the}} advantages they offer over HDDs. Unlike HDDs, SSDs have no moving mechanical parts, meaning they are less susceptible to shock and also run silently. SSDs also offer faster access time, as HDDs require time in order for the moving parts to speed up to operating specifications. An SSD drive can be 4 or 5 times faster than a traditional HDD drive. For an SSD drive, files <b>almost</b> open <b>instantly.</b> This means with an SSD, booting up a system and launching programs take less time. SSDs will increase the performance of a system by how often the game accesses the drive in order load items from the game such as levels and textures. However, SSDs cost much more than HDDs do per gigabyte, meaning in terms of pure capacity, they are not as cost effective. They also currently offer a lower common maximum capacity than HDDs.|$|R

60|$|A man may {{be absorbed}} in the deepest thought, and his brow will remain smooth until he {{encounters}} some obstacle in his train of reasoning, or is interrupted by some disturbance, and then a frown passes like a shadow over his brow. A half-starved man may think intently how to obtain food, but he probably will not frown unless he encounters either in thought or action some difficulty, or finds the food when obtained nauseous. I have noticed that <b>almost</b> everyone <b>instantly</b> frowns if he perceives a strange or bad taste in what he is eating. I asked several persons, without explaining my object, to listen intently to a very gentle tapping sound, the nature and source of which they all perfectly knew, and not one frowned; but a man who joined us, and who could not conceive what we were all doing in profound silence, when asked to listen, frowned much, though not in an ill-temper, and {{said he could not}} in the least understand what we all wanted. Dr. Piderit[3] who has published remarks to the same effect, adds that stammerers generally frown in speaking, and that a man in doing even so trifling a thing as pulling on a boot, frowns if he finds it too tight. Some persons are such habitual frowners, that the mere effort of speaking almost always causes their brows to contract.|$|R
