5|$|In 2009, a {{security}} system at a scrap metal yard, {{which had been}} repeatedly burglarized, went off. The yard's owner {{was at the time}} on a hunt close to the yard and drove directly to it. A group of burglars jumped into their car <b>and</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> drive away. The owner used his shotgun <b>and</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> shoot the car's tires, hitting and wounding two of its occupants.

Production of the colony's most important cash crop, tobacco, was high throughout the war, averaging about 40million pounds (18million kg) annually.|$|E
5|$|After the Cold War, the {{conflict}} in the Middle East triggered a crisis in 1990, when Iraq under Sadaam Hussein invaded <b>and</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> annex Kuwait, an ally of the United States.

Bush launched Operation Desert Shield, a defensive force buildup in Saudi Arabia, and Operation Desert Storm, in a staging titled the Gulf War; waged by coalition forces from 34 nations, led by the United States against Iraq ending in the successful expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, restoring the former monarchy.|$|E

The Soviet Consul in Barentsburg visited Ny-Ålesund in 1968 <b>and</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> make inspections of the installation.

5|$|Although the United States Navy was {{prevented}} from developing fortifications on the Aleutian Islands {{due to the}} terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, the Navy believed that at some point the United States' treaty obligations would no longer apply, and began to scout the Aleutians for possible naval bases.

5|$|Although {{the issues}} the Dutch {{designers}} were having with a propulsion system were discussed, the delegation {{came away from}} Italy entirely uninspired by the Italians' efforts in that area. On the other hand, the visit provoked a drastic reworking of the internal subdivision of the proposed battlecruisers. The designers {{got rid of the}} previously required central longitudinal bulkhead <b>and</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> raise the double bottom to provide greater protection against magnetic torpedoes. However, due to the requirement for a shallow draft, this modification had to be abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Bokhary's first {{brush with}} the police {{was in the early}} hours of 24 June 2001, when the manager of a bar in Central {{district}} of Hong Kong reported to police that she was causing a disturbance. When police officers arrived <b>and</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> arrest Bokhary, she hit one officer on the cheek; it took four officers at the scene to put her in handcuffs. Police also found a plastic bag with small amounts of cocaine on her person. She was found guilty of the assault and fined HK$9,000 (US$1,153). She was held not guilty of cocaine possession because of doubts over the evidence.|$|E
5|$|British General Sir Henry Clinton {{moved up}} from New York City <b>and</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> divert American {{attention}} by capturing two forts in the Hudson River highlands on October 6, but his efforts were {{too late to}} help Burgoyne. Burgoyne attacked Bemis Heights again on October 7 after {{it became apparent that}} he would not receive relieving aid in time. This battle culminated in heavy fighting marked by Arnold's spirited rallying of the American troops. Burgoyne's forces were thrown back to the positions that they held before the September 19 battle and the Americans captured a portion of the entrenched British defenses.|$|E

5|$|Crawford led about 500 {{volunteer}} militiamen, {{mostly from}} Pennsylvania, deep into American Indian territory, {{with the intention}} of surprising the Indians. The Indians and their British allies from Detroit had already learned of the expedition, however, and gathered a force to oppose the Americans. After a day of indecisive fighting near the Sandusky towns, the Americans found themselves surrounded <b>and</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> retreat. The retreat turned into a rout, but most of the Americans managed to find their way back to Pennsylvania. About 70 Americans were killed; Indian and British losses were minimal.|$|E
5|$|Cuarón {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} {{with his son}} Jonás <b>and</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> develop the film at Universal Pictures.

In 2000, aged 65, he was jogging five to six miles daily to stay in shape. Taylor was diagnosed with hepatitis C in 1989, but it {{was found to be}} dormant by 2000.
