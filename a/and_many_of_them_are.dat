5|$|The {{existence}} of aposematism in marine ecosystems is controversial. Many marine organisms, particularly those on coral reefs, are brightly coloured or patterned, including sponges, corals, molluscs and fishes, {{with little or}} no connection to chemical or physical defenses. Caribbean reef sponges are brightly coloured, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> chemically defended, but there is no relationship between the two factors.|$|E

Lambert, from his {{birth to the}} moment of his dissolution, with an account of men noted for their corpulency, and other interesting matter, the first full biography of Lambert to be released after his death. Lambert's position as the heaviest person in recorded history was soon overtaken by the American Mills Darden (1799–1857), but Lambert had by now become a cult figure, and virtually every item connected with him was preserved for posterity. His clothes and possessions were sold at auction to collectors, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> preserved in museums today.|$|E

25|$|Exactly {{how many}} slaves {{were brought to}} the New World on Swedish ships is yet {{impossible}} to know, since most of the archives documents have not been investigated seriously in that respect, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> by now not accessible because of their bad preservation and non microfilming. Nevertheless, some data, mostly concerning the former Swedish island Saint-Barthélemy, is now available online.|$|E

25|$|Caterpillars {{as a rule}} are {{voracious}} feeders <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> {{among the}} most serious of agricultural pests. In fact many moth species are best known in their caterpillar stages because of the damage they cause to fruits and other agricultural produce, whereas the moths are obscure and do no direct harm. Conversely, various species of caterpillar are valued as sources of silk, as human or animal food, or for biological control of pest plants.|$|E

The intention is to add specific strains of microbes to aid the decomposition process – but their effectiveness is disputed and recent research found no effect in scientific test conditions.|$|E
25|$|South Korea's still {{continuing}} traditionalist beliefs {{result in}} few people being open about their homosexuality. Homosexuality is discouraged, although homosexuality is legal in South Korea. As a result, {{there are few}} if any legal protections in place for gays and lesbians, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> afraid {{to come out to}} their families, friends, and co-workers. Gay men are not allowed to serve in the military, and in 2005 five soldiers were discharged for homosexuality.|$|E

25|$|Laos {{is labeled}} {{as a source}} country of men, women, and {{children}} for the sex slave industry and the forced labor industry. Many of the Lao migrants move to countries like Thailand or are sent to China from a transit country.

In Thailand there are no labor protection for domestic workers, which can lead to risks for the migrant Lao females.|$|E
25|$|Several other {{alternative}} keyboard layouts {{have been designed}} either for use with specialist commercial keyboards (e.g. Maltron and PLUM) or by hobbyists (e.g. Asset, Arensito, Minimak, Norman, Qwpr and Workman); however, {{none of them are}} in widespread use, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> merely proofs of concept. Principles commonly used in their design include maximising use of the home row, minimising finger movement, maximising hand alternation or inward rolls (where successive letters are typed moving towards the centre of the keyboard), minimising changes from QWERTY to ease the learning curve, and so on.|$|E

25|$|How {{distressing}} {{it is to}} {{be unable}} to send missionaries to Virginia, where there are five hundred thousand Negroes! It is indubitable that had we missionaries and funds to support them, prodigies would be effected in this vast and untilled field. In Maryland blacks are converted every day, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> good Catholics and excellent Christians. At Baltimore many are frequent communicants, and three hundred or four hundred receive the Blessed Sacrament the first Sunday of every month. It is the same throughout Maryland, where there are a great many Catholics among the Negroes.|$|E
25|$|Openly {{transsexual}} {{people can}} have difficulty maintaining employment. Most {{find it necessary to}} remain employed during transition in order to cover the costs of living and transition. However, employment discrimination against trans people is rampant <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> fired when they come out or are involuntarily outed at work. Transsexual people must decide whether to transition on-the-job, or to find a new job when they make their social transition. Other stresses that transsexual people face in the workplace are being fearful of coworkers negatively responding to their transition, and losing job experience under a previous name—even deciding which rest room to use can prove challenging. Finding employment can be especially challenging for those in mid-transition.|$|E
