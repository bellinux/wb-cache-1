40|$|Polar bears(Ursus maritimus) are top predators of the Arctic marine ecosystem, {{and as a}} consequence, {{accumulate}} {{relatively high}} burdens of organochlorine (OC) contaminants in their fat tissue. Depending on their nutritional and reproductive status, polar bears undergo extreme annual fluctuations in their adipose tissue depots. I determined the dynamics of OCs in adipose tissue, milk, and plasma of polar bears during seasonal fasting and feeding, pregnancy, and {{the first two months}} of lactation. I collected tissue samples from free-ranging polar bears both before and after a period of fasting and feeding, and analyzed them for concentrations and total body burdens of chlorobenzenes (S-ClBzs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (S-HCHs), chlordanes (S-CHLORs), dichlorodiphenyl-trichloroethane compounds (S-DDTs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (S-PCBs). During seasonal fasts, mean body burdens of S-DDTs declined by 50 % while burdens of S-ClBzs, S-CHLORs, and S-PCBs remained the same for most bears. Females with high OC concentrations in their adipose tissue also had high concentrations in their milk. The OC body burdens of females with COYs correlated positively to those of their cubs. Adipose tissue concentrations of some specific OC compounds decreased during fasting whereas other compounds became concentrated. By contrast, specific OC compounds in adipose time of feeding bears remained relatively constant with little variation between captures. The relationship of OC compounds between mother and cub generally remained the same during fasting; some compounds were always higher in the cubs than mother and others the opposite. The fate of stored lipophilic OCs during pregnancy and lactation in an animal that is fasting and the consequent OC dynamics in their young cubs is unknown. I determined total body burden (total body fat * OC concentration) and concentration change of OCs in female polar bears during pregnancy and the first 2 - 3 months of lactation. In March soon after den emergence, I also determined OC concentrations in adipose tissue and plasma from cubs. Organochlorine body burdens in seven female polar bears declined during gestation and the initial lactation period. Lactation was estimated to account for 59 %- 66 % of the decrease in S-PCBs and S-CHLORs burdens, 37 %- 49 % for S-HCHs and S-ClBzs burdens, and 5 % of the decrease for S-DDTs burdens. Total body burdens of OCs for cubs in spring were calculated to be 1 - 4 % of pregnant females and 3 - 7 % of nursing mothers. Whole body concentrations for mothers and cubs were similar for all OCs except for S-PCBs, where cubs had lower whole body concentrations than their mothers. Cubs and mothers had similar concentrations of S-DDTs in their adipose tissue and plasma. There was a positive relatonship between the concentration of <b>allOCs</b> in adipose tissue and milk from females with young cubs. Females who lost their cubs had significantly higher mean OC concentrations in their milk in spring than did females who kept their cubs. This correlation between OC concentration in mother's milk and the subsequent survival of their cubs warrants further investigation. This first year for the cub is a period of rapid growth and development that may be impaired with the presence of high OC loads. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Approaches to {{reducing}} irrigation inputs to crops {{have been studied}} for the past 50 to 60 years in research settings. Fewer efforts {{have been made to}} document limited irrigation responses over a number of seasons on commercial fields. This study compared farm−based irrigation management (FARM) with best management practices (BMP), late initiation of irrigation (LATE), and a restricted allocation (<b>ALLOC).</b> These irrigation management strategies each occupied 1 / 8 of a center pivot system in southwest Nebraska in continuous corn production, on four cooperating farms, which were replicated at the same sites for 3 to 6 years. Irrigation variables were achieved by irrigating or not irrigating, or by speeding up or slowing down the center pivot. When the grain yields and irrigation amounts were normalized each year using the FARM treatment as the basis, on average for three of four locations, the BMP treatment yielded equal to the FARM treatment, the LATE treatment yielded 93 % of the FARM treatment and the <b>ALLOC</b> yielded 84 % of the FARM treatment. At the same time, it took 76 % and 57 % of the water for the LATE and <b>ALLOC</b> treatments, respectively, to achieve these yields. The adjusted gross returns (yield price – irrigation treatment costs) of the irrigation treatments were analyzed for each location. When the gross returns were normalized using the FARM treatment as the basis, FARM and BMP returns were equal across combinations of high and low input commodity prices and pumping costs. The LATE treatment gross return was 95 % of FARM return. The gross return for the <b>ALLOC</b> treatment was 85 % to 91 % of the FARM treatment.

40|$|Traditionally, {{collective}} {{operations have}} been {{thought of as}} two-sided memory operations. This means that while performing such operations, the processing elements (i. e., threads) need to synchronize their execution in order to guarantee certain semantics of the language. Of course, this raises some interesting issues, for example, agreeing on some synchronization point, whether all threads need to synchronize or just the pair of threads, and whether synchronization is needed at all. In the collective operation speci¯cation[2, 1] and the draft proposal of the collective extensions[3], this two-sided view has been expressed.

The compiler allocates each procedure a register stack frame with its size explicitly specified using an <b>alloc</b> instruction.

The virtual register stack frames and RSE alleviate the need of explicit spills by the compiler, but our experimental results indicate that a trade-off exists between using stacked registers and explicit spills under high register pressure due to the uneven cost between them. In this work, we introduce the stacked register quota assignment problem based on the observation that reducing stacked register usage in some procedures could reduce the total memory access time of spilling registers, which includes the time caused by the loads/stores due to explicit register spills and RSE overflows/fills. We propose a new inter-procedural algorithm to solve the problem by allocating stacked registers across procedures based on a quantitative cost model.

40|$|Cellular DNA is {{susceptible}} to damage by chemical agents that causes modifications which includes interstrand cross-links (ICL). ICLs covalently attach the complementary DNA strands, and interfere with replication and transcription by preventing strand separation. The deliberate formation of ICL in DNA by bi-functional alkylating chemotherapeutic agents leads {{to the death of}} cancer cells. Development of tumors resistant to these agents is a factor in the lack of response in some patients, with removal of ICL believed {{to play a role in}} resistance. In mammalian cells, the precise role of excision repair in eliminating ICL is not completely understood. For better understanding of the repair pathways involved in removing ICL damage, ICL DNA duplexes containing well-defined modified moieties are required to mimic the lesions induced by chemotherapeutic agents. This thesis describes two major approaches that have been investigated to synthesize ICL DNA. The first describes a method to prepare DNA duplexes containing cross-linked N 3 -butylene-N 3 thymidines that enables the preparation of asymmetric nucleotide sequences around cross-linked sites. Protective groups for the 3 ’- and 5 ’-hydroxyl moieties were screened for compatibility of subsequent extensions from a cross-linked thymidine dimer incorporated in a support bound oligonucleotide by automated DNA synthesis. Two cross-linked dimer phosphoramidites were prepared, one with dimethoxytrityl (DMT) and allyloxycarbonyl (<b>Alloc)</b> protective groups at 5 ’-O positions and a 3 ’-O-t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) group which enabled the production of completely asymmetric ICL DNA duplexes in good yields. After coupling of the cross-linked phosphoramidite to a linear strand assembled on the solid support, the DMT group was cleaved on the synthesizer to allow for the synthesis of the second arm of the duplex. The <b>Alloc</b> group was then removed via an off-column strategy to expose the 5 '-hydroxyl group to complete assembly of one strand of the duplex to form a "Y-shaped" intermediate. Final removal of a 3 '-O-TBS group off column followed by coupling with deoxynucleoside 5 '-phosphoramidites yielded ICL DNA duplexes containing completely asymmetric nucleotide composition around the cross-link site. The identity and composition of the ICL duplexes were confirmed by mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF) and enzymatic digestion. The synthesized ICL duplexes displayed characteristic features of a B-form duplex and had stabilities that were higher than those of the unmodified controls assessed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and UV thermal denaturation experiments. The second major project describes approaches to prepare a 7 -deaza- 2 ’-deoxyguanosine cross-linked dimer where the C 7 atoms are attached by an alkylene linker. The chemical instability of alkylated N 7 2 ’-deoxyguanosine (dG) represents a major challenge for preparing ICL DNA containing an alkylene linkage between the N 7 atoms. The incorporation of a C 7 -alkylene cross-linked dimer of 7 -deaza- 2 ’-deoxyguanosine in DNA would allow for the preparation of a chemically stable ICL which mimic lesions formed by bifunctional alkylating agents (i. e. mechlorethamine and hepsulfam). Two synthetic methods were explored to prepare 7 -deazaguanine (and other 7 -deazapurines). These involved two cyclization strategies to prepare these molecules starting from a pyrimidine or a pyrrole to produce the purine. In both synthetic methods it was challenging to purify some of the intermediates. All intermediates in the synthetic method starting from the pyrimidine precursors to produce the 7 -deazapurines were more stable while the production of the 7 -deazapuines from the pyrroles resulted in higher yields. An attempt to produce a C 7 cross-linked dimer of 7 -deaza- 2 ’-deoxyguanosine containing a heptamethylene linker is described. Starting from 7 -deazaguanine, 7 -iodo- 7 -deaza- 2 ’-deoxyguanosine was prepared in good yield. This nucleoside was converted to 5 ’-O-DMT- 7 -iodo- 7 -deaza- 2 ’-deoxyguanosine and the Sonogashira reaction used with 1, 6 -heptadiyne to introduce the heptamethylene linker. Unfortunately, multiple challenges were encountered with the dimerization and hydrogenation reactions which did not allow for the synthesis of the desired dimer for solid-phase synthesis of the ICL DNA...|$|E

Peatlands are carbon-rich ecosystems that cover just three per cent of Earth’s land surface 1, but store one-third of soil carbon 2. Peat soils are formed by the build-up of partially decomposed organic matter under waterlogged anoxic conditions. Most peat is found in cool climatic regions where unimpeded decomposition is slower, but deposits are also found under some tropical swamp forests 2, 3. Here we present field measurements from one of the world’s most extensive regions of swamp forest, the Cuvette Centrale depression in the central Congo Basin 4. We find extensive peat deposits beneath the swamp forest vegetation (peat defined as material with an organic matter content of at least 65 per cent to a depth of at least 0. 3 [*]metres). Radiocarbon dates indicate that peat began accumulating from about 10, 600 years ago, coincident with the onset of more humid conditions in central Africa {{at the beginning of the}} Holocene 5. The peatlands occupy large interfluvial basins, and seem to be largely rain-fed and ombrotrophic-like (of low nutrient status) systems. Although the peat layer is relatively shallow (with a maximum depth of 5. 9 [*]metres and a median depth of 2. 0 [*]metres), by combining in situ and remotely sensed data, we estimate the area of peat to be approximately 145, 500 square kilometres (95 per cent confidence interval of 131, 900 – 156, 400 square kilometres), making the Cuvette Centrale the most extensive peatland complex in the tropics. This area is more than five times the maximum possible area reported for the Congo Basin in a recent synthesis of pantropical peat extent 2. We estimate that the peatlands store approximately 30. 6 petagrams (30. 6 [*]×[*] 1015 [*]grams) of carbon belowground (95 per cent confidence interval of 6. 3 – 46. 8 petagrams of carbon) —a quantity that is similar to the above-ground carbon stocks of the tropical forests of the entire Congo Basin 6. Our result for the Cuvette Centrale increases the best estimate of global tropical peatland carbon stocks by 36 per cent, to 104. 7 petagrams of carbon (minimum estimate of 69. 6 petagrams of carbon; maximum estimate of 129. 8 petagrams of carbon 2). This stored carbon is vulnerable to land-use change and any future reduction in precipitation 7, 8.
