5|$|The {{greatest}} disaster {{occurred in}} southern Haiti, where {{as many as}} 2,000 people died, possibly more. The towns of Jacmel and Jérémie—both on the Tiburon Peninsula—were devastated by catastrophic freshwater flooding <b>after</b> <b>days</b> of torrential rains. The entire peninsula, already remote in its own right, was isolated for a time, ensuring only scant detail of the disaster reached the outside world.

5|$|On 6 September, XXXVI Corps {{launched}} a frontal assault against the Soviet fortifications but made only slow progress. XXXVI Corps attempted another flanking attack similar to Kayrela, with one German regiment trying {{to circumvent the}} Soviet defenses in the south. This time it did not work as well, and the German effort bogged down against heavy resistance. <b>After</b> <b>days</b> of fighting, the Germans were finally able to push behind the Voyta River only to be confronted by another even stronger Soviet defense line. The so-called VL or Verman Line stretched from Lake Verkhneye Verman to Lake Tolvand and included heavy Soviet pre-war fortifications.|$|E

5|$|On 8 May, <b>after</b> <b>days</b> {{of heavy}} aerial bombardment, the final German {{offensive}} in the Kerch Peninsula, Operation Bustard Hunt, began. The 44th Army quickly collapsed, and the 51st Army {{was forced to}} fight off frontal attacks while also defending its open left flank. The 390th, in reserve, was sent into battle at Arma-Eli, and its 789th Regiment delayed the German advance, gaining time {{for the rest of}} the division to set up a defensive line in preparation for a counterattack. However, Lvov and his command staff were killed in an airstrike on the army headquarters, and no counterattack took place. Furthermore, on 13 May, division commander Babayan was wounded and evacuated, further diminishing the army leadership. By 14 May the German advance reached the shores of Kerch Bay, cutting off the troops retreating towards Eltigen and Kamysh-Burun. At this point, the 789th Regiment, now commanded by its commissar, S. Sargsyan, launched a counterattack, throwing the German troops back on the slopes of Mount Mithridat. For three days the regiment, suffering heavy casualties, held its positions and delayed the German advance. However, German troops advanced into Kerch from the southwest and the situation became hopeless. Upon orders from the Crimean Front command, from 14 to 20 May, the 51st Army covered the evacuation of the troops. The remnants of the division were among those evacuated across the Kerch Strait, but the fighting left the division nearly destroyed. It was officially disbanded on 14 June 1942, along with other divisions destroyed in Crimea, and its survivors were used to provide the experienced core of new formations.|$|E

Analysis of variance showed that all the three lines are {{different from each other}} for each of the characters.

For root volume, N after 45 and 75 days of sowing and N and NK <b>after</b> 90 <b>days</b> of sowing had significant effect. N <b>after</b> 15 <b>days</b> of sowing, PK <b>after</b> 30 <b>days</b> of sowing, P <b>after</b> 45 <b>days</b> of sowing, K and NP <b>after</b> 60 <b>days</b> of sowing, K <b>after</b> 75 <b>days</b> of sowing and NK <b>after</b> 90 <b>days</b> of sowing found to be significantly effective for nodule number.
