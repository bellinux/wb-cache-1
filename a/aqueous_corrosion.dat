50|$|Given {{that the}} turbine blades {{in a water}} turbine are {{constantly}} exposed to water and dynamic forces, {{they need to have}} high corrosion resistance and strength. The most common material used in overlays on carbon steel runners in water turbines are austenitic steel alloys that have 17% to 20% chromium to increase stability of the film which improves <b>aqueous</b> <b>corrosion</b> resistance. The chromium content in these steel alloys exceed the minimum of 12% chromium required to exhibit some atmospheric corrosion resistance. Having a higher chromium concentration in the steel alloys allows for a much longer lifespan of the turbine blades. Currently, the blades are made of martensitic stainless steels which have high strength compared to austenitic stainless steels by a factor of 2. Besides corrosion resistance and strength as the criteria for material selection, weld-ability and density of the turbine blade. Greater weld-ability allows for easier repair of the turbine blades. This also allows for higher weld quality which results in a better repair. Selecting a material with low density is important to achieve higher efficiency because the lighter blades rotate more easily. The most common material used in Kaplan Turbine blades are stainless steel alloys (SS). The different alloys used are SS(16Cr-5Ni), SS(13Cr-4Ni), SS(13Cr-1Ni). The martensitic stainless steel alloys have high strength, thinner sections than standard carbon steel, and reduced mass that enhances the hydrodynamic flow conditions and efficiency of the water turbine. The SS(13Cr-4Ni) has been shown to have improved erosion resistance at all angles of attack through the process of laser hardening. It is important to minimize erosion in order to maintain high efficiencies because erosion negatively impacts the hydraulic profile of the blades which reduces the relative ease to rotate.|$|E

From {{the result of}} cyclic anodic polarization tests conducted in 3. 5 wt. % NaCl solution at 25, 48, 72 and 95 °C, as the temperature increased, the resistance to pitting corrosion decreased significantly, especially over the range of 25 ~ 48 °C. From the result of crevice corrosion tests, no crevice corrosion occurred on FAL-Mo in the lower chloride-containing solution (200 ppm Cl), however, FAL-Mo did not perform {{as well as the}} 304 L SS in the higher chloride-containing solution (3. 5 wt. % NaCl). From the result of anodic polarization tests performed in sulfur-compound solutions, additions of Cr and Mo to the Fe 3 Al-based iron aluminides tend to improve the <b>aqueous</b> <b>corrosion</b> resistance. <b>Aqueous</b> <b>corrosion</b> behaviors with different Al content evaluated by cyclic anodic polarization test in the chloride-containing solution exhibited the more stable passive behavior and the higher pitting resistance as Al contents increased...|$|E
40|$|A {{major factor}} {{limiting}} {{the use and}} longevity of rare earth based magnetic materials is their susceptibility to <b>aqueous</b> <b>corrosion</b> and associated detrimental effects upon the magnetic properties of the material. This process was investigated {{through a combination of}} exposure to simulated environmental conditions and hydrogen absorption/desorption studies (HADS) in conjunction with magnetic characterisation. This study utilises NdFeB MQP-B melt-spun ribbon manufactured by Magnequench, in the form of MQI bonded magnets and also in its unbonded state as MQ powder. Specifically, it was concerned with how effective a variety of bonding media (epoxy resin,PTFE, zinc) and surface coatings (PTFE, Qsil, zinc LPPS, Dex-Cool) were at limiting the impact of <b>aqueous</b> <b>corrosion</b> in MQI bonded magnets. To characterise the effect of hydrogen absorption upon the magnetic properties of the MQP-B, hydrogen uptake was induced followed by a series of outgassing heat treatments with subsequent magnetic characterisation accompanied by HADS techniques performed after each outgas. This allowed comparisons to be made between the effects of <b>aqueous</b> <b>corrosion</b> process and hydrogen absorption upon the magnetic properties of the alloy. This study has clearly demonstrated the link between the abundance of environmental moisture and rate of Hci losses in MQI bonded magnets. In addition to this the key mechanism responsible for the degradation of magnetic properties has been identified. These losses have been attributed to the absorption of hydrogen generated by the dissociation of water in the presence of NdFeB during the <b>aqueous</b> <b>corrosion</b> process. It has been shown that the use of a bonding media that is impermeable to water can limit the effects of <b>aqueous</b> <b>corrosion</b> by limiting water access to the Magnequench particles (MQP) and also the positive effects of the use of suitable surface coatings {{has been shown to be}} effective for the same reason...|$|E

40|$|Although much {{research}} {{has been carried out}} on the erosion of materials in aqueous slurries, little attention has been given to defining transitions between erosion regimes in such environments. This is despite the large amount of work that has been carried out in this area in 'dry' high temperature corrosion environments. Defining transitions between regimes permits distinction between erosion and corrosion dominated behaviour which can be an aid to materials selection and to process monitoring in such conditions. This paper describes the basis of a relatively simple theoretical method for evaluating the transitions between erosion and <b>aqueous</b> <b>corrosion</b> regimes. Models for solid particle erosion at normal impact are combined with those for <b>aqueous</b> <b>corrosion</b> to define regimes of damage in corrosion conditions varying from dissolution to passivation. This permits the construction of the erosion-aqueous corrosion map where the transitions between the regimes are shown as a function of erosion and <b>aqueous</b> <b>corrosion</b> variables. The rationale for the regimes suggested is discussed on the basis of research on erosion maps in oxidising conditions. The boundaries on the maps are compared with experimental data. Other issues addressed in this study include using the erosion-corrosion map to identify favourable and adverse operating conditions in addition to identifying the mechanism of damage...|$|E

40|$|Independent {{of thermal}} loading scenarios, the waste {{packages}} at the potential repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada {{will be exposed}} to environmental conditions where {{there is the possibility}} of significant water film formation occurring on the waste packages. Water films can cause aggressive <b>aqueous</b> film electrochemical <b>corrosion</b> on susceptible metals or alloys. Water film formation will be facilitated when relative humidities are high, when hygroscopic salts are present on the surfaces, when corrosion products are hygroscopic, and when particles form crevices with the surfaces (capillary effect). Also certain gaseous contaminants, such as, NO{sub x} and SO{sub 2 }, can facilitate water film formation. It should be noted that water film formation can occur at isolated spots (e. g. surface defects and salt particles) and need not cover the entire surface for electrochemical corrosion to occur. This activity will characterize the long term corrosion of metal specimens at two nominal relative humidities (50 and 85 %) and at 80 C. Under the low relative humidity (50 %) condition, water film formation is expected to be limited and therefore <b>aqueous</b> film electrochemical <b>corrosion</b> is expected also to be limited.

The predictions of the residual stresses generated during the deposition of the coating over the different metallic surfaces were also performed using analytical and numerical model studies. Validation o f the models was earned out by comparing the results to experimental data. The surface morphology and the elemental composition of the coatings before and after each test were examined using SEM and EDS techniques. The results indicate that the presence of weld or having a composite substrate formed by two different materials does affect the residual stresses at the interface, as it lowers bending, tensile, fatigue strength and enhancing corrosion effect, as observed by the analytical and experimental analyses carried out in this research. Microscopic obseivation of the fractured surfaces showed that the cracks were formed at the interface between the coating and substrate material as well as within the coating. Presence of non-melted particles in the coating enhanced crack propagation and erosion rates.
