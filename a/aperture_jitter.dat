40|$|Abstract. Increasingly, {{software}} radio {{techniques are}} {{being used in the}} implementation of communications receivers in general, and GNSS receivers in particular. In such a receiver, the received signal is sampled as close to the receive antenna as possible, and all subsequent processing uses digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. The sampling clock will suffer from phase noise instabilities, leading to a phenomenon known as <b>aperture</b> <b>jitter.</b> This paper examines the effects of <b>aperture</b> <b>jitter</b> for a number of “typical ” software radio GNSS receivers. A jitter specification is derived which restricts the noisy effects due to jitter to 10 dB below thermal noise.

Jitter is the limiting effect in ADCs with a digitization bandwidth between 1 MHz and 1 GHz. The effect of <b>aperture</b> <b>jitter</b> and clock jitter have been investigated previously. However, some very important aspects are still missing, in particular investigations on the spectral distribution of the jitter induced error. This gap is filled by this paper...|$|E
40|$|Extremely {{high-speed}} ADCs (> 1 GSPS) {{demand a}} low-jitter sample clock {{in order to}} preserve Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). These 8 - and 10 -bit converters have best-case noise floors set by quantization noise. For an N-bit ADC sampling a full-scale sinusoid, the well known expression for SNR (in dB) is: SNR = 6. 02 N + 1. 76. This sets the best case noise floor for an 8 -bit ADC at − 49. 9 dBc. The noise floor degrades from this point due to factors such as jitter on the sample clock, intrinsic <b>aperture</b> <b>jitter</b> of the ADC, spurious components arising from non-linearities in the ADC quantizer, and other internal noise such as thermal noise. In this article, we look at the strategy for optimizing the performance of the sample clock based on PLL/VCO characteristics. This means minimizing overall integrated phase noise, which minimizes clock jitter. The Root-Mean-Square (RMS) jitter of the sample clock combines with the intrinsic RMS <b>aperture</b> <b>jitter</b> of the ADC in a root-sum-square fashion to produce a total affective jitter. Total RMS jitter is...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} scenario, {{wireless}} technologies require an advanced receiver which supports multi-standard and multi-mode transmission. In an ideal software radio, the data conversion process occurs {{immediately after the}} antenna in the receiver chain [...] A/D conversion {{at an early stage}} plays an important role for achieving such flexibility at the receiver. Bandpass sampling allows for the digitisation of bandpass signals at RF or intermediate frequencies. The sampling process is never ideal, and many factors limit performance. One factor is Timing Jitters (<b>aperture</b> <b>jitter</b> and clock jitter) of the sample-and-hold function of the ADC. This results in a variation of the sampling period from one sample to another, degrading performance. This effect becomes more serious as sampling occurs at higher carrier frequencies. This paper investigates the effects of timing jitter in bandpass sigma delta ADC sampling systems, and describes how oversampling the information signal has an impact on the effects of jitters and also gives evaluation of the performance in terms of SNR and draw mean error power spectrum due to <b>aperture</b> <b>jitter</b> as well as clock jitter...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Analog-to-digital {{converters}} (ADC’s) are ubiquitous, {{critical components}} of software radio and other signal processing systems. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art of ADC’s, including experimental converters and commercially available parts. The distribution of resolution versus sampling rate provides insight into ADC performance limitations. At sampling rates below 2 million samples per second (Ms/s), resolution {{appears to be}} limited by thermal noise. At sampling rates ranging from 2 Ms/s to 4 giga samples per second (Gs/s), resolution falls off by 1 bit for every doubling of the sampling rate. This behavior {{may be attributed to}} uncertainty in the sampling instant due to <b>aperture</b> <b>jitter.</b> For ADC’s operating at multi-Gs/s rates, the speed of the device technology is also a limiting factor due to comparator ambiguity. Many ADC architectures and integrated circuit technologies have been proposed and implemented to push back these limits. The recent trend toward single-chip ADC’s brings lower power dissipation. However, technological progress as measured by the product of the ADC resolution (bits) times the sampling rate is slow. Average improvement is only 1. 5 bits for any given sampling frequency over the last six–eight years.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the sampling and jitter specifications and considerations for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) software receivers. Software radio (SWR) technologies {{are being used}} in the implementation of communication receivers in general and GNSS receivers in particular. With the advent of new GPS signals, and a range of new Galileo and GLONASS signals soon becoming available, GNSS is an application where SWR and software-defined radio (SDR) are likely to have an impact. The sampling process is critical for SWR receivers, where it occurs as close to the antenna as possible. One way to achieve this is by BandPass Sampling (BPS), which is an undersampling technique that exploits aliasing to perform downconversion. BPS enables removal of the IF stage in the radio receiver. The sampling frequency is a very important factor since it influences both receiver performance and implementation efficiency. However, the design of BPS can result in degradation of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) due to the out-of-band noise being aliased. Important to the specification of both the ADC and its clocking Phase- Locked Loop (PLL) is jitter. Contributing to the system jitter are the <b>aperture</b> <b>jitter</b> of the sample-and-hold switch at the input of ADC and the sampling-clock jitter. <b>Aperture</b> <b>jitter</b> effects have usually been modeled as additive noise, based on a sinusoidal input signal, and limits the achievable Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a basic model for time-interleaved {{photonic}} analog-to-digital converter (TIPADC) and analyze its linear, nonlinear, and noise performance. The basic operation mechanism of TIPADC is illustrated and the linear performance is analyzed in frequency domain. The mathematical expressions and {{the output of the}} system are presented in each processing step. We reveal that photonic sampling folds the whole spectrum of input signal in a narrow band, which enables the analog bandwidth of a TIPADC to be much higher than the bandwidth of back-end electronics. The feasible regions of the system is obtained in terms of system frequency response, and a set of sampling criteria determining the basic requirements to the system are summarized for typical applications. The results show that the global minimum feasible bandwidth of back-end electronics is the half of single channel sampling rate when the bandwidth of photonic sampling pulse is comparable to input signal frequency. The amplitude and phase noise of photonic sampling pulse train, the thermal noise and shot noise of photodetection, and the quantization noise and <b>aperture</b> <b>jitter</b> noise of EADCs are investigated. The nonlinearity of TIPADC is also analyzed. The effect of different factors, such as the single channel sampling rate, the average optical power and the bandwidth of back-end electronics, on the effective number of bits of TIPADC is qualitatively and quantitatively discussed. The results explicitly show that TIPADC can perform high fidelity conversion to ultra-high speed analog signal and overcome the major performance limitations existing in traditional ADCs such as <b>aperture</b> <b>jitter</b> and bandwidth. The criteria deduced will be an effective supplement to the generalized sampling theorem in designing TIPADC...|$|E
40|$|Aperture {{uncertainty}} {{is a key}} ADC concern when performing IF sampling. The terms <b>aperture</b> <b>jitter</b> and aperture uncertainty are synonymous and are frequently interchanged in the literature. Aperture {{uncertainty is}} the sample-to-sample variation in the encoding process. It has three distinct effects on system performance. First, it can increase system noise. Second, it {{can contribute to the}} uncertainty in the actual phase of the sampled signal itself giving rise to increases in error vector magnitude. Third, it can heighten intersymbol interference (ISI). However, in typical communications applications, an aperture uncertainty that is sufficiently small to meet system noise constraints results in negligible impact on phase uncertainty and ISI. For example, consider the case of sampling an IF of 250 MHz. At that speed, even 1 ps of <b>aperture</b> <b>jitter</b> can limit any ADC’s SNR to only 56 dB, while for the same conditions, the phase uncertainty error is only 0. 09 degrees rms based on a 4 ns period. This is quite acceptable even for a demanding specification such as GSM. The focus of this analysis is, therefore, on overall noise contribution due to aperture uncertainty. Figure 1 illustrates how an error in the sampling instant results in an error in the sampled voltage. Mathematically, the magnitude of the sampled voltage error is defined by the time derivative of the signal function. Consider a sine wave input signal v (t) Asin (2 π ft) The derivative is (t) dv dt = (1) (πft = A 2 πf cos 2) (2) The maximum error occurs when the cosine function equals 1, that is, at t = 0. (0) dv dt max = A 2 πf (3) We see from Figure 1 that dv is the error in the sampled voltage corresponding to the jitter dt. For conceptual clarity, if we relabel dv as Verr and dt as ta (aperture error) and rearrange the factors, we ge...|$|E

Photonic ADCs, which perform sampling using ultra-stable optical pulse trains generated by mode-locked lasers, have been investigated as a promising approach to overcome the jitter problem and bring ADC performance to new levels.

This corresponds to 15 fs jitter, a 4 - 5 times improvement over the jitter of the best electronic ADCs, and an order of magnitude improvement over the jitter of electronic ADCs operating above 10 GHz.

The experimental data were compared with the simulation, showing indeed a perfect agreement with the latter and confirming the capability of the system to reach sub-micrometric accuracy.

40|$|Performance of state-of-the-art, {{electronic}} analog-to-digital converters {{is currently}} {{limited by the}} 100 -fs <b>aperture</b> <b>jitter.</b> However, optical sampling can overcome the jitter limit by using femtosecond lasers that have jitter as low as 100 as, which is a three orders of magnitude improvement when compared to electronics. Currently, most of these lasers exist as bulk or fiber lasers. While such configurations can provide flexibility in order to tailor {{the behavior of the}} lasers to specific needs, they are usually as expensive as $ 10, 000 to $ 100, 000 and require precisely adjustable mounts and high-quality optical components. To realize the possibility of femtosecond lasers replacing current electronics for unprecedented performance in the future, these lasers must be as compact, robust, and affordable as electronic circuits. A monolithically integrated mode-locked laser can lower the cost of building such femtosecond lasers and, at the same time, make them less vulnerable to environmental perturbation. This can be achieved by mass-producing them with less expensive materials such as silicon, silicon oxide, or compatible materials. Since all necessary optical components are integrated monolithically on a silicon substrate, bulky and expensive high-precision discrete components can be excluded. The goal of this thesis is the development of femtosecond lasers that can overcome the limit of electronics and potentially replace them.

Subfemtosecond (1 h) 3 -mrad level phase stability of a 10. 225 GHz microwave signal extracted from a mode-locked laser is demonstrated. The third topic is timing stabilized fiber links for large-scale timing distribution. Precise optical timing distribution to remote locations {{can result in}} synchronization over long distances. In doing so, acoustic noise and thermal drifts introduced to the fiber links must be canceled by a length-correction feedback loop. A single type-II phase-matched PPKTP crystal is used to construct a compact and self-aligned balanced optical cross-correlator for precise timing detection. (cont.) Using this correlator, a 310 m long fiber link is stabilized with long-term sub- 10 fs accuracy. The final topic is photonic analog-to-digital conversion of high-frequency microwave signals.

Unfortunately, {{the performance of the}} high speed ADC is limited by the timing accuracy of the sampling clock. A small sampling uncertainty can cause a large error in the sampled voltage and result in harmonic distortions at the output. For different architectures of the T/H circuits, the timing error can arise from the clock random jitter or the phase skew among multi-phase clocks. For the ADC with global T/H circuits in front-end, an architecture with sine-wave sampling clock will be introduced that exhibits less random <b>aperture</b> <b>jitter.</b> First, the signal-dependent sampling error will be analyzed, and the comparison of the calculated and simulated results will be presented.

40|$|Wide-band signals play {{important}} roles in the most exciting areas of science, engineering, and medicine. To {{keep up with the}} demands of exploding internet traffic, modern data centers and communication networks are employing increasingly faster data rates. Wide-band techniques such as pulsed radar jamming and spread spectrum frequency hopping are used on the battlefield to wrestle control of the electromagnetic spectrum. Neurons communicate with each other using transient action potentials that last for only milliseconds at a time. And in the search for rare cells, biologists flow large populations of cells single file down microfluidic channels, interrogating them one-by-one, tens of thousands of times per second. Studying and enabling such high-speed phenomena pose enormous technical challenges. For one, parasitic capacitance inherent in analog electrical components limits their response time. Additionally, converting these fast analog signals to the digital domain requires enormous sampling speeds, which can lead to significant jitter and distortion. State-of-the-art imaging technologies, essential for studying biological dynamics and cells in flow, are limited in speed and sensitivity by finite charge transfer and read rates, and by the small numbers of photo-electrons accumulated in short integration times. And finally, ultra-high throughput real-time digital processing is required at the backend to analyze the streaming data. In this thesis, I discuss my work in developing real-time instruments, employing ultrafast optical techniques, which overcome some of these obstacles. In particular, I use broadband dispersive optics to slow down fast signals to speeds accessible to high-bit depth digitizers and signal processors. I also apply telecommunication multiplexing techniques to boost the speeds of confocal fluorescence microscopy. 	The photonic time stretcher (TiSER) uses dispersive Fourier transformation to slow down analog signals before digitization and processing. The act of time-stretching effectively boosts the performance of the back-end electronics and digital signal processors. The slowed down signals reach the back-end electronics with reduced bandwidth, and are therefore less affected by high-frequency roll-off and distortion. Time-stretching also increases the effective sampling rate of analog-to-digital converters and reduces <b>aperture</b> <b>jitter,</b> thereby improving resolution. Finally, the instantaneous throughputs of digital signal processors are enhanced by the stretch factor to otherwise unattainable speeds. Leveraging these unique capabilities, TiSER becomes the ideal tool for capturing high-speed signals and characterizing rare phenomena. For this thesis, I have developed techniques to improve the spectral efficiency, bandwidth, and resolution of TiSER using polarization multiplexing, all-optical modulation, and coherent dispersive Fourier transformation. To reduce the latency and improve the data handling capacity, I have also designed and implemented a real-time digital signal processing electronic backend, achieving 1. 5 tera-bit per second instantaneous processing throughput. Finally, I will present results from experiments highlighting TiSER's impact in real-world applications. 	 Confocal fluorescence microscopy is the most widely used method for unveiling the molecular composition of biological specimens. However, the weak optical emission of fluorescent probes and the tradeoff between imaging speed and sensitivity is problematic for acquiring blur-free images of fast phenomena and cells flowing at high speed. Here I introduce a new fluorescence imaging modality, which leverages techniques from wireless communication to reach record pixel and frame rates.
