25|$|Most of {{the novel}} is set {{during the time of the}} Risorgimento, {{specifically}} during the period when Giuseppe Garibaldi, the hero of Italian unification, swept through Sicily with his forces, known as The Thousand. The plot focuses upon the aristocratic Salina family, which is headed by the stoic Prince Fabrizio, a consummate womanizer who foresees the upcoming downfall of his family and the nobility in Italy as a whole but finds himself unable to change the course of history. As the novel opens in May 1860, Garibaldi's Redshirts have landed on the Sicilian coast and <b>are</b> <b>pressing</b> inland to overthrow the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.|$|E

500|$|Initially, {{despite a}} few setbacks, {{military}} action {{seemed to go}} in Gebhard's favor, until October, 1583, when the Elector Palatine died, and Casimir disbanded his army {{and returned to his}} brother's court as guardian for the new duke, his 10-year-old nephew. In November, 1583, from his castle Arensberg in Westphalia, he wrote to Francis Walsingham, adviser and spymaster to Queen Elizabeth: [...] "Our needs <b>are</b> <b>pressing,</b> and you [...] and the Queen's other virtuous counsellors we believe can aid us; moreover, since God has called us to a knowledge of Himself, we have heard from our counsellors that you love and further the service of God." ...|$|E
500|$|The plot they {{described}} corresponds {{with the first}} and second episodes of Avatar: The Last Airbender, where the [...] "water people" [...] ( [...] and Sokka) rescue the [...] "air guy" [...] (Aang) while [...] "trapped in a snowy wasteland" [...] (the Southern Water Tribe) with [...] "some fire people [...] <b>are</b> <b>pressing</b> down on them" [...] (Fire Nation Troops and Zuko). The creators of the show intended Aang to be trapped in an iceberg for one thousand years, later to wake inside a futuristic world, wherein he would have a robot named Momo and a dozen bisons. The creators lost interest in this theme, and changed it to one hundred years of suspended animation. The robotic Momo became a flying lemur, and the herd of bison was reduced to one.|$|E
500|$|Avatar: The Last Airbender was co-created and {{produced}} by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko at Nickelodeon Animation Studios in Burbank, California. Its animation was primarily done by three South Korean studios: JM Animation, DR Movie, and MOI Animation. According to Konietzko, {{the series was}} conceived {{in the spring of}} 2001 when he took an old sketch of a balding, middle-aged man and imagined the character as a child. He drew the character herding bison in the sky, and showed the sketch to DiMartino. At the time, DiMartino was watching a documentary about explorers trapped at the South Pole. Konietzko described their early development of the concept: [...] "There's an air guy along with these water people trapped in a snowy wasteland ... and maybe some fire people <b>are</b> <b>pressing</b> down on them ..." [...] The co-creators successfully pitched the idea to Nickelodeon vice president and executive producer Eric Coleman two weeks later. The series was introduced to the public in a teaser reel at Comic-Con 2004, and premiered on February 21, 2005.|$|E

500|$|After {{finishing}} the story, Peter carelessly aims a flare gun through an air vent, causing the sprinklers to come on. Meanwhile, Meg {{is trying to}} persuade the burglars to attack her {{but they are not}} interested. The rest of the family, still trapped in the panic room, are preparing to potentially drown from the sprinklers filling the room up with water. Peter tells the story of his ancestor, Willie [...] "Black-Eye" [...] Griffin, who was a silent film star in the 1920s, but whose career later faltered due to his vo(much like Bobcat Goldthwait's) not being cut out for talking pictures. Peter then tells his family about his great uncle, Peter Hitler, who was able to provide Adolf Hitler with success at his Munich speech, although annoying Adolf greatly. As the water from the sprinklers almost reaches its peak, Peter admits to the family that he did not care for The Godfather and a heated debate ensues, ending with Peter declaring his love for The Money Pit. At the last minute Joe rescues them, draining the water out of the room, thus saving their lives. Joe informs the family he has arrested the burglars, but they <b>are</b> <b>pressing</b> harassment charges against Meg. Joe warns that they will need a lawyer to combat the charges, but the family ignores him, and Joe finally gives up and takes Meg away while the family ignores her cries for help.|$|E
500|$|Acquaviva had {{instructed}} that should anything happen to Weston, Garnet was {{to succeed him}} as superior in England, which he did when only days after leaving Harlesford, Weston was captured en route to London. [...] Acquaviva had also given Garnet permission to print pro-Catholic literature, and so early the next year he met Southwell in London to discuss {{the establishment of a}} secret press, which was probably located somewhere around a former Augustinian hospital near Spitalfields. [...] It lasted until late 1588 and was responsible for A Consolatory Letter to All the Afflicted Catholikes in England, author unknown, and An Epistle of Comfort, by Southwell. From a friend's window in Ludgate Hill, Garnet witnessed the November 1588 procession to a thanksgiving service at Old St Paul's Cathedral, celebrating the failed Spanish invasion. [...] Spain's actions gave Garnet much cause for concern, [...] "For when we thought that there was an end to these disasters by which we are already nearly destroyed, our hope was suddenly turned to sorrow, and now with redoubled effort the overseers <b>are</b> <b>pressing</b> upon us". People were allowed to spectate from windows only if their loyalty to Queen Elizabeth I was guaranteed by the householder. [...] In a letter to Acquaviva, Garnet said that many of his supporters thought that he was more concerned for the Queen than her Calvinist ministers. In light of the Armada's destruction, he also wrote to the general to ask for advice on two versions of a proposed oath to allow Roman Catholics to swear their allegiance to the Queen. The government's version required that Catholics reject the pope's authority over Elizabeth, whereas the Catholic version proposed that they recognise her authority and [...] "would wish with every effort to struggle to thwart and to fight to the death all those who will in any way endanger the life of her Highness". The Privy Council rejected the latter.|$|E

France has sought the extradition of Captain Alfredo Astiz for the kidnapping and murder of its nationals, among them nuns LÃ©onie Duquet and Alice Domon. Adolfo Scilingo, a former Argentine naval officer, was convicted in Spain, on 19 April 2005, to 640 years on charges of crimes against humanity. In 1998, Videla received a prison sentence {{for his role in}} the kidnapping of eleven children during the regime and for the forgery of the children's identity documents (the [...] "stolen babies", kidnapped from the parents arrested, and raised by military families).

2500|$|The {{move was}} {{described}} as an [...] "earthquake" [...] by an Israeli official who wished to remain anonymous, and prompted harsh criticism by prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu who said in a broadcast statement: [...] "As prime minister of Israel, I will not allow {{the hundreds of thousands}} of Israelis who live in the West Bank, Golan Heights and our united capital Jerusalem to be harmed. We will not accept any external diktats about our borders. This matter will only be settled in direct negotiations between the parties." [...] Israel is also concerned that the same policy could extend to settlement produce and goods exported to European markets, as some EU member states <b>are</b> <b>pressing</b> for an EU-wide policy of labelling produce and goods originating in Jewish settlements to allow consumers to make informed choices. A special ministerial panel led by prime minister Netanyahu, decided to approach the EU and demand several key amendments in the guidelines before entering any new projects with the Europeans.
