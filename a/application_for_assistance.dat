40|$|The Australian Government has {{provided}} adjustment {{assistance to the}} rural sector since 1970 under several schemes. The demand for assistance has been lower than expected, given the alleged size of the problem, particularly for the 'welfare' oriented provisions. The results of a survey of farmers' attitudes to the current Rural Adjustment Scheme are examined {{in an attempt to}} explain this phenomenon. Measures designed to ease financial difficulties or to facilitate on-farm adjustment were much preferred to those designed to assist farmers to leave agriculture. Considerable confusion about the scheme was evident and many farmers thought that information about the scheme was inadequate. Better extension and counselling is suggested to improve information flows to farmers. The formulation of a more structured set of eligibility criteria is also suggested to reduce the complexity and uncertainty which farmers face when they are considering lodging an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance.</b> Community/Rural/Urban Development,...|$|E
40|$|In our {{paper we}} chose to study care {{management}} in the old age care. According to the law for the social services the needs of elderly should govern the assistance they are granted. But {{research has shown that}} municipal guidelines govern the assistance and that the elderly have to adjust their needs to them. Thus there is a discrepancy between law and practice. The aim {{of this study was to}} understand how care managers relate to municipal guidelines, laws and the requests of elderly when the <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance</b> is established. We wanted to understand what strategies they use to deal with situations when the aforementioned factors are not consistent. The theoretical approaches we chose were Lipsky’s theory of street-level bureaucrats. The method we used was qualitative and consisted of six informal interviews made with care managers in the municipality of Växjö, Sweden. Based on our interviews we identified eight different themes: the availability of resources, directing conversations and the use of routines, legitimize decisions, legitimize through the possibility of entering an appeal, legitimize through constructing the client, the adaptation of the objectives to the possibilities to perform them, diminishing their capability and professionalism. Our conclusion was that the requests of elderly did govern their assistance, as long as they coincided with the municipal guidelines. If the requests fell outside the guidelines it often required medical or social reasons for granting them. The municipal guidelines were never abandoned to create a uniquely designed assistance...|$|E
