40|$|A {{flight test}} program was {{conducted}} with a sophisticated, integrated avionics system to study pilot workload and the pilot interface {{with high levels of}} avionics capability. The study indicates that advanced systems can provide improved information to the pilot and additional functional capability. The study also indicates that additional research is needed to develop the knowledge base required to design pilot interfaces with such systems. The combination of the pilot interface and the high level of system capability used in this study led to pilot blunders associated with navigation data management, <b>autopilot</b> <b>management,</b> and maintaining awareness of system status. A functional relationship is suggested between level of avionics system sophistication and the required state-of-the-art in pilot/avionics interface design.

40|$|A flight {{study was}} {{conducted}} to study pilot workload and the pilot interface with high levels of avionics capability and automation. The study was done in the context of general aviation, single-pilot IFR operations and utilized an experimental, digital, integrated avionics system. Results indicate that such advanced systems can provide improved information to the pilot and increased functional capability. The results also indicate that additional research is needed to increase the knowledge base required to design the pilot interfaces with highly capable systems. A CRT-based moving map display format tested provided excellent navigational situational awareness but was inferior to an HSI for manual path tracking. The complexity of navigation data management, <b>autopilot</b> <b>management,</b> and maintaining awareness of system status contributed to pilot workload and errors. Suggested guidelines for the design of the pilot/avionics interface for advanced avionics systems are given...|$|E

50|$|Beyond the {{hardware}} of home cockpits, most flight simulator software can simulate modern aircraft systems {{to a very}} high standard {{in addition to the}} basic flight dynamics, providing accurate recreations of, among others, the FMC (Flight <b>Management</b> Computer), <b>autopilot</b> and engine <b>management</b> systems. With additional hardware and add-in software this may be extended further, for example into a fully functional overhead panel requiring real-world check lists to be followed for engine start-up and flight with a full flight deck crew.|$|R
50|$|The C-160 {{proved to}} be a {{versatile}} aircraft, leading to a long operational service life. Between its introduction and 1999, approximately 2000 modifications and upgrades were incorporated upon the type, split 60/40 between the structure and equipment respectively. Many changes were made over time in regards to the aircraft's avionics: particular attention was paid in Luftwaffe refurbishments to the navigation and flight control systems, onboard data management computers and radar system, incorporating new features such as GPS and laser inertial navigation systems, modern <b>autopilot</b> and crew <b>management</b> systems, and a greater degree of cockpit integration.|$|R
50|$|GPS {{receivers}} used in {{air navigation}} have databases which contain named waypoints, radio navigation aids, airports and heliports. These references comprise the National Airspace System's method of allowing air traffic to select routes that yield efficient point-to-point navigation. Waypoints {{are often used}} in the termination phase of a flight to its destination airport. Some GPS receivers are integrated into <b>autopilot</b> or flight <b>management</b> systems, to aid the pilot in control of an aircraft. Waypoints may be found on Aeronautical Charts known as Instrument Flight Rules Enroute Low Altitude Charts, Terminal Arrival Procedures or Sectional Charts.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} extend the type's service, six ex-South African SA 330L were {{purchased}} by Britain in 2002. A programme to produce an extensive upgrade of the RAF's Pumas saw the first Puma HC Mk2 enter service in late 2012 and was completed by early 2014, enabling the Puma fleet to remain in operational service until 2025. In 2008, it was envisaged that 30 aircraft would be upgraded, this was subsequently cut to 22, and was later revised upwards {{for a total of}} 24 HC Mk2 Pumas to be produced. Upgrades include the integration of two Turbomeca Makila engines, new gearboxes and tail rotors, new engine controls, digital <b>autopilot,</b> a flight <b>management</b> system, an improved defensive aids suite, as well as ballistic protection for helicopter crew and passengers. The upgraded aircraft can transport double the payload over three times the range than its predecessor, and will be deployed by for tactical troop transport, as well as fast moving contingent combat and humanitarian operations.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{traffic on}} {{highways}} {{and in the}} air has {{in the recent years}} motivated the design of hierarchical hybrid control systems. In this paper we will propose a hierarchical hybrid control system for the control of traffic on sea, a Sea Traffic Management System (STMS). The motivation is to reduce delays and improve the efficiency and safety in increasingly overcrowded harbors, busy straits and narrow areas on sea. A controller unit on land plans the whole traffic scenario, and interacts with advanced (hybrid) autopilots placed on each ship. A system as described above should take advantage of the new available technology, such as satellite based navigation (GPS-systems), digital sea maps, faster and more powerful computers, and more and better actuators. Keywords: Hierarchical Hybrid Control, Sea Traffic <b>Management,</b> <b>Autopilot.</b> 1 Introduction In some busy harbors of today there exists systems for traffic control and surveillance.

40|$|The control {{automation}} and interaction paradigm (e. g., manual, <b>autopilot,</b> flight <b>management</b> system) used on virtually all large highly automated aircraft {{has long been}} an exemplar of breakdowns in human factors and human-centered design. An alternative paradigm is the Haptic Flight Control System (HFCS) that is part of NASA Langley Research Center s Naturalistic Flight Deck Concept. The HFCS uses only stick and throttle for easily and intuitively controlling the actual flight of the aircraft without losing any of the efficiency and operational benefits of the current paradigm. Initial prototypes of the HFCS are being evaluated and this paper describes one such evaluation. In this evaluation we examined claims regarding improved situation awareness, appropriate workload, graceful degradation, and improved pilot acceptance. Twenty-four instrument-rated pilots were instructed to plan and fly four different flights in a fictitious airspace using a moderate fidelity desktop simulation. Three different flight control paradigms were tested: Manual control, Full Automation control, and a simplified version of the HFCS. Dependent variables included both subjective (questionnaire) and objective (SAGAT) measures of situation awareness, workload (NASA-TLX), secondary task performance, time to recognize automation failures, and pilot preference (questionnaire). The results showed a statistically significant advantage for the HFCS in a number of measures. Results that were not statistically significant still favored the HFCS. The results suggest that the HFCS does offer an attractive and viable alternative to the tactical components of today s FMS/autopilot control system. The paper describes further studies that are planned to continue to evaluate the HFCS...|$|R
40|$|In this {{abstract}} {{the following}} commercial aircraft 3 avionics systems will be merged together: (1) Autopilot Flight Director System (APFDS), (2) Flight Control System (FCS) and (3) Flight Management Systems (FMS). Problem statement: These systems perform functions that are dependant {{and related to}} each other, also they consists of similar hardware components. Each of these systems consists {{of at least one}} computer, control panel and displays that place on view the selection and aircraft response. They receive several similar sensor inputs, or outputs of one system are fed as input to the other system. By combining the three systems, repeated and related functions are reduced. Since these systems perform related functions, designers and programmers verify that conflict between these systems is not present. Combining the three systems will eliminate such possibility. Also used space, weight, wires and connections are decreased, consequently electrical consumption is reduced. To keep redundancy, the new system can be made of multiple channels. Approach: The new system (called <b>Autopilot</b> Navigation <b>Management</b> System, APNMS) is more efficient and resolves the above mention drawbacks. Results: The APFDS system functions (as attitude-hold or heading-hold) are merged with the FCS system main function which is controlling flight control surfaces as well as other functions as flight protection, Turn coordination and flight stability augmentation. Also the Flight Management system functions (as flight planning, aircraft flight performance/engine thrust management) are merged in the new system. All this is done through combining all 3 systems logic softwares. Conclusion/Recommendations: The new APNMS system can be installed and tested on prototype aircraft in order to verify its benefits and fruits to the aviation industry...|$|R
40|$|Accidents due to engine failure, pilot {{disorientation}} or {{pilot incapacitation}} occur far {{more frequently in}} general aviation than in commercial aviation, yet general aviation aircraft are equipped with less safety-enhancing features than commercial aircraft. This thesis presents the design of an emergency autoland system that includes automatic landing site selection, guidance to the selected landing site and guidance along the final approach, {{in addition to the}} automatic landing capability provided by conventional autoland systems. The proposed system builds on the capability of a general aviation <b>autopilot,</b> flight <b>management</b> system and GPS/WAAS augmented, integrated navigation system. The system provides this automatic landing capability without the use of automatic throttle control and without the use of a radar altimeter, which are essential to conventional autoland systems, but are typically lacking on general aviation aircraft. The design addresses the challenge of no automatic throttle control by utilizing only two simple power settings: cruise power and zero power. The lack of radar altimeter is addressed by appropriate flare planning and placement of the target touchdown point. The approach from the point of autoland initiation, to the approach fix at the the landing site, is performed at cruise power, provided that power is available. The final approach from the approach fix to touchdown, is performed at zero power. Control of the touchdown point location during the final approach is achieved through adjustment of the length of the trajectory, whenever the aircraft’s glide performance deviates from the expected performance. The aircraft’s glide performance is measured online as the aircraft tracks the planned trajectory. The performance of the final design is evaluated in simulation in terms of touchdown point dispersion, sink rate and attitude on touchdown. Avidyne, Inc...|$|R
40|$|A helical {{flight path}} {{trajectory}} (helix) involves flying exact circles {{over the ground}} while climbing or descending at a given flight path angle and speed profile. The manoeuvre is challenging to fly in windy conditions, since the path reference is inertial whereas the aircraft naturally tends to move with the air mass. Tracking a helix introduces periodical lateral and longitudinal wind shears in turn. This makes the helix an excellent manoeuvre for testing autopilot control laws, allowing to evaluate co-ordination of longitudinal and lateral modes, tracking accuracy along a curved flight path, combined tracking of inertial (flight path) and air mass-based references (airspeed), and to evaluate the trade-off between behaviour in turbulence and wind shear. Since helical flight path trajectories are not a standard option in most <b>autopilot</b> / flight <b>management</b> systems, this chapter derives generally applicable reference variables and high-level control strategies for use with typical autopilot structures. This allows the reader to fly the helix manoeuvre using {{his or her own}} autopilot design. As an example, simulation and flight test results for an autopilot developed for DLR´s test aircraft ATTAS will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the implementation {{and evaluation of}} technologies that predict and assess the future aircraft energy state and autoflight configuration, and provide appropriate alerting to better inform pilots {{of the effect of}} problematic autoflight inputs or conditions. Prediction algorithms are used to extrapolate {{the current state of the}} aircraft based on flight <b>management,</b> <b>autopilot</b> and autothrottle system control laws and knowledge of mode transition logic. The resulting predicted trajectory represents the future four-dimensional flight path of the aircraft if the current course of action is continued. Probabilistic methods are used to estimate the trim envelope through high-fidelity model-based computation of attainable equilibrium sets. The corresponding maneuverability limitations of the aircraft are determined through a robust reachability analysis (relative to the trim envelope) through an optimal control formulation. The combination of prediction and assessment technologies are used to trigger timely alerts to avoid loss of control situations. The maneuvering envelope limits are also indicated on the primary flight display, and the predicted trajectory is displayed on navigation and vertical situation displays. The display features and alerts were evaluated in the Advanced Concepts Flight Simulator at NASA Ames Research Center, where commercial airline crews flew multiple problematic approach and landings scenarios to investigate the impact on current and future aircraft energy state awareness. Results show that the display features and alerts have the potential to improve situational awareness of what the automation is doing now and what it will do in the future...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model-based {{training}} program for {{the skills necessary to}} operate advance avionics systems that incorporate advanced <b>autopilots</b> and fight <b>management</b> systems. The training model is based on a formalism, the operational procedure model, that represents the mission model, the rules, and the functions of a modem avionics system. This formalism has been defined such that it can be understood and shared by pilots, the avionics software, and design engineers. Each element of the software is defined in terms of its intent (What?), the rationale (Why?), and the resulting behavior (How?). The Advanced Computer Tutoring project at Carnegie Mellon University has developed a type of model-based, computer aided instructional technology called cognitive tutors. They summarize numerous studies showing that training times to a specified level of competence can be achieved in one third the time of conventional class room instruction. We are developing a similar model-based {{training program for}} the skills necessary to operation the avionics. The model underlying the instructional program and that simulates the effects of pilots entries and the behavior of the avionics is based on the operational procedure model. Pilots are given a series of vertical flightpath management problems. Entries that result in violations, such as failure to make a crossing restriction or violating the speed limits, result in error messages with instruction. At any time, the flightcrew can request suggestions on the appropriate set of actions. A similar and successful training program for basic skills for the FMS on the Boeing 737 - 300 was developed and evaluated. The results strongly support the claim that the training methodology can be adapted to the cockpit...|$|R
