25|$|Barillas {{was unique}} among all liberal presidents of Guatemala between 1871 and 1944: he handed over power to his {{successor}} peacefully. When election time approached, he sent {{for the three}} Liberal candidates to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> their government plan would be. Satisfied with the response of Reyna Barrios, Barillas made sure a huge column of Quetzaltenango and Totonicapán Indigenous people {{came down from the}} mountains to vote for the general.

Reyna Barrios of course received nothing, but he went on to become President on March 15, 1892.|$|E
