It also identifies problems of over-grazing resulting in the impoverishment of moorland and upland habitats {{and a loss of}} native woodland, caused by the large numbers of red deer and sheep.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at the Russian {{imperial}} {{court in}} Saint Petersburg in 1755, he became romantically {{involved with the}} twenty-six-year-old Catherine Alexeievna (the future Empress Catherine the Great, reigned 1762–1796). With her support, in 1764 he was elected king of Poland. Against expectations, he attempted to reform and strengthen the ailing Commonwealth. His efforts met with external opposition from Prussia, Russia and Austria, all interested in keeping the Commonwealth weak; and from internal conservative interests, which saw reforms <b>as</b> <b>threatening</b> their traditional liberties and prerogatives.|$|E
5|$|The topics the Drapier {{addresses}} span from absentee land {{owners to}} importing of goods from Britain to the favouring of Englishmen over Irishmen for Irish governmental positions. These issues were the many issues that Swift cared about and saw <b>as</b> <b>threatening</b> Ireland before Wood's halfpence controversy. However, these individual issues {{were not as}} important as the independence and unity of Ireland: the specifics of independence were less important than self-rule. Some argue that Swift, after Wood's patent was withdrawn, removed himself from the political landscape to focus on writing Gulliver's Travels, in which he picked up many of the same ideas.|$|E

5|$|Equines {{produce a}} number of vocalizations and noises. Loud {{snorting}} is associated with alarm. Squealing is usually made when in pain, but bachelors will also squeal while play fighting. The contact calls of equines vary from the whinnying and nickering of the horse, the barking of plains zebras, and the braying of asses and Grévy's zebras. Equines also communicate with visual displays and the flexibility of their lips allows them to make complex facial expressions. Visual displays also incorporate {{the positions of the}} head, ears and tail. An equine may signal an intention to kick by laying back its ears and sometimes lashing the tail. Flattened ears, bared teeth and abrupt movement of the heads may be used <b>as</b> <b>threatening</b> gestures, particularly among stallions.|$|E
5|$|Mulder, Scully, Asekoff, and Fazekas are rescued, {{but there}} is no sign of Glaser or the other {{creature}}. Upon leaving the forest, Mulder states that the creature may, in fact, be an evolved version of the first Spanish conquistadors who had first settled in the forest 450 years before. Although Kinsley finds it ridiculous, Mulder believes that centuries of seclusion could be adequate for such drastic adaptations to happen. Afterwards, Mulder realizes that the creatures presume others' presence in their territory <b>as</b> <b>threatening</b> and rushes to the hotel room where Scully is packing her things. After ascertaining that she is finished packing, he firmly urges her to vacate the room, which she does. The camera then pans under the bed where a pair of red eyes open.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, Babe begins blackmailing Les anonymously. Les' wife, Pam Coker (Lin Blakley), realises Babe is the blackmailer, but is too {{ashamed to}} report it so Babe continues to increase the blackmail amount. Babe later threatens to reveal photos of Les crossdressing, causing Pam to humiliate herself while {{the stress of the}} blackmail causes Les to suffer a heart attack. When Babe discovers that Abi and Lee had sex and that Abi has passed on an STI to Lee's pregnant girlfriend, Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Babe badly burns Abi's hand. After the fling is exposed, Abi informs the Carter family about Babe's involvement and the family subsequently disown her. At a low ebb, Babe begins blackmailing the Cokers again, despite the recent death of their grandson, Paul, as well <b>as</b> <b>threatening</b> Abi. Pam eventually confides in Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) about the blackmail and she threatens Babe to stop it.|$|E

5|$|Despite risking his own money, Kurosawa chose a {{story that}} was more {{directly}} critical of the Japanese business and political elites than any previous work. The Bad Sleep Well, based on a script by Kurosawa's nephew Mike Inoue, is a revenge drama about {{a young man who}} is able to infiltrate the hierarchy of a corrupt Japanese company with the intention of exposing the men responsible for his father's death. Its theme proved topical: while the film was in production, mass demonstrations were held against the new U.S.-Japan Security treaty, which was seen by many Japanese, particularly the young, <b>as</b> <b>threatening</b> the country's democracy by giving too much power to corporations and politicians. The film opened in September 1960 to positive critical reaction and modest box office success. The 25-minute opening sequence depicting a corporate wedding reception is widely regarded as one of Kurosawa's most skillfully executed set pieces, but the remainder of the film is often perceived as disappointing by comparison. The movie has also been criticized for employing the conventional Kurosawan hero to combat a social evil that cannot be resolved through the actions of individuals, however courageous or cunning.|$|E

25|$|The unions of the AFL were {{composed}} primarily of skilled men; unskilled workers, African-Americans, {{and women were}} generally excluded. The AFL saw women <b>as</b> <b>threatening</b> the jobs of men, since they often worked for lower wages. The AFL provided little to no support for women's attempts to unionize.|$|E
25|$|Many in {{developing}} countries see globalization as a positive force that lifts them out of poverty. Those opposing globalization typically combine environmental concerns with nationalism. Opponents consider governments as agents of neo-colonialism that are subservient to multinational corporations. Much of this criticism comes from the middle class; the Brookings Institution suggested this was because the middle class perceived upwardly mobile low-income groups <b>as</b> <b>threatening</b> to their economic security.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{introduced}} to numerous parts of the world, and in those areas is often used as a commercial source of tannin or a source of firewood for local communities. In areas where it {{has been introduced}}, it is often considered a weed, and is seen <b>as</b> <b>threatening</b> native habitats by competing with indigenous vegetation, replacing grass communities, reducing native biodiversity and increasing water loss from riparian zones. Found in tropical rainforests.|$|E

25|$|Ban {{has told}} senior {{managers}} that homophobia {{will not be}} tolerated. He pointed to countries such as Ukraine which has proposed criminalizing public discussion about homosexuality <b>as</b> <b>threatening</b> basic human rights. He further stated that government {{has a duty to}} defend vulnerable minorities. In April 2013, he described LGBT rights {{as one of the great}} neglected human rights of our time. He also said that religion, culture or tradition can never justify denial of basic rights.|$|E
25|$|Next is Aristophanes, {{the comic}} playwright. Aristophanes tells a fantastical, mythological {{story about how}} humans were at one time twice {{the people that they}} are now, but this was seen <b>as</b> <b>threatening</b> to the gods, so Zeus to cut {{everyone}} in half. And ever since, humans go about in search of their other half, in order to become whole. Agathon, the host, follows Aristophanes, and his speech sees Eros as youthful, beautiful, and wise; and as the source of all human virtues.|$|E
25|$|Criminal Law is {{the body}} of law that relates to crime. It proscribes conduct {{perceived}} <b>as</b> <b>threatening,</b> harmful, or otherwise endangering to the property, health, safety, and moral welfare of people. Most criminal law is established by statute, {{which is to say}} that the laws are enacted by a legislature. It includes the punishment of people who violate these laws. Criminal law varies according to jurisdiction, and differs from civil law, where emphasis is more on dispute resolution and victim compensation than on punishment.|$|E

25|$|China's {{trade surplus}} is {{considered}} by some in the United States <b>as</b> <b>threatening</b> American jobs. In the 2000s, the Bush administration pursued protectionist policies such as tariffs and quotas to limit the import of Chinese goods. Some scholars argue that China's growing trade surplus {{is the result of}} industries in more developed Asian countries moving to China, and not a new phenomenon. China's trade policy, which allows producers to avoid paying the Value Added Tax (VAT) for exports and undervaluation of the currency since 2002, has resulted in an overdeveloped export sector and distortion of the economy overall, a result that could hamper future growth.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, {{two events}} {{occurred}} which the Al Saud perceived <b>as</b> <b>threatening</b> the regime, {{and had a}} long-term influence on Saudi foreign and domestic policy. The first was the Iranian Islamic revolution. There were several anti-government riots in the region in 1979 and 1980. The second event was the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Islamist extremists. The militants involved were in part angered by what they {{considered to be the}} corruption and un-Islamic nature of the Saudi regime. Part of the response of the royal family was to enforce a much stricter observance of Islamic and traditional Saudi norms. Islamism continued to grow in strength.|$|E
25|$|Within the kingdom, Hugh {{intensified}} his existing {{habit of}} giving any available offices or lands to relations, including his numerous legitimate and illegitimate progeny, {{and a small}} circle of old and trusted friends. The effect this had on Italian nobles who saw this <b>as</b> <b>threatening</b> themselves eventually resulted in rebellion. In 941, Hugh expelled Berengar of Ivrea from Italy and abolished the March of Ivrea. In 945, Berengar returned from exile in Germany and defeated Hugh in battle. By a diet Berengar held at Milan, Hugh was deposed, though he managed {{to come to terms}} by which he nominally kept the crown and the title rex (king) but returned to Provence, leaving Lothair as nominal king, but with all real power in Berengar's hands.|$|E
