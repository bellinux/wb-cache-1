5000|$|Many {{political}} philosophers {{have been}} {{fond of the}} word indefeasible when referring to rights, e.g., that were inalienable, divine, or indubitable. For example, in the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights, [...] "community hath an indubitable, inalienable, and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish government..." [...] (also attributed to James Madison); and John Adams, [...] "The people have <b>a</b> <b>right,</b> <b>an</b> indisputable, unalienable, indefeasible, divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge - I mean of the character and conduct of their rulers."Also, Lord Aberdeen: [...] "indefeasible right inherent in the British Crown" [...] and Gouverneur Morris: [...] "the Basis of our own Constitution is the indefeasible Right of the People." [...] Scholarship about Abraham Lincoln often cites these passages in the justification of secession. Philosophers who use the word defeasible have historically had different world views from those who use the word indefeasible (and this distinction has often been mirrored by Oxford and Cambridge zeitgeist); hence it is rare to find authors who use both words.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper has}} shown that, first,“the {{owner of the}} firm”is a {{misleading}} word. Just as Robin Hood cannot be termed {{as the owner of}} the gang, shareholders of the firm cannot be termed as the owners of the firm. Each resource provider of the firm has property rights only on the resource he provides, i. e., he has an ex-ante choice to join or not to join the firm, and after he invests his resource in the firm, he obtains <b>a</b> <b>right</b> (<b>an</b> option) to ex-post share the big pie generated by the firm. Since unlike public goods, firms always have clear definitions for the resource providers’property rights, and the ex-post wealth of the firm will be distributed to the resource providers according to ex-ante contracts, the so-called first claim of debtholders (or material providers or labor providers) does not have any advantage. Second, as argued by Coase, the size of the firm is determined by the transaction cost of using the price mechanism and the transaction cost of using authority or power, and an activity will be counted {{as a part of the}} firm only when it is under the direction of the firm. But power or authority cannot come from the firm’s long-term contracts (as Coase suggested), the monitor’s revising or adding contracts (as Alchian et al. suggested), or owning nonhuman assets (as Alchian et al. and Hart suggested). Power comes from choices (more choices mean more power), and choices come from innovations which can create exces...|$|E

40|$|Today, {{privacy is}} a key concept. It is also one which is rapidly {{evolving}} with technological advances, {{and there is no}} consensus on a single definition for it. In fact, the concept of privacy has been defined in many different ways, ranging from the “right to be left alone” to being a “commodity” that can be bought and sold. In the same time, powerful Ambient Intelligence (AmI) systems are being developed, that deploy context-aware, personalised, adaptive and anticipatory services. In such systems personal data is vastly collected, stored, and distributed, making privacy preservation a critical issue. The human- centred focus of AmI systems has prompted the introduction of new kinds of technologies, e. g. Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET), and methodologies, e. g. Privacy by Design (PbD), whereby privacy concerns are included {{in the design of the}} system. One particular application field, where privacy preservation is of critical importance is Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). Emerging from the continuous increase of the ageing population, AAL focuses on intelligent systems of assistance for a better, healthier and safer life in their living environment. In this paper, we first build on our previous work, in which we introduced a new tripartite categorisation of privacy as <b>a</b> <b>right,</b> <b>an</b> enabler, and a commodity. Second, we highlight the specific privacy issues raised in AAL. Third, we review and discuss current approaches for privacy preservation. Finally, drawing on lessons learned from AAL, we provide insights on the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. Part of our methodology is a statistical analysis performed on the IEEE publications database. We illustrate our work with AAL scenarios elaborated in cooperation with the city of Luxembourg...|$|E
40|$|Currently, the National Labor Relations Board {{determines whether}} union {{organizers}} {{have a right}} to access employer property by looking almost exclusively to an employer’s state law right-to-exclude. If the employer possesses such <b>a</b> <b>right,</b> <b>an</b> attempt to exclude organizers will generally be lawful; if the employer lacks that right, the exclusions will be unlawful. This analysis makes little sense, as an employer’s state property interests are irrelevant to the primary labor issue in these cases—whether the exclusion interferes with employees’ federal labor rights. Employees will tend to view hostile or discriminatory exclusions of organizing activity as coercive, whether or not the employer has state right-to-exclude. Further, because the property rights issue is often complex, an employer cannot be sure of its ability to exclude organizers until litigation has ended and is thereby forced to decide whether to allow what is arguably a trespass, or protect its property interests and risk a labor law violation. The focus on state property rights also creates significant problems for the NLRB, as its lack of expertise in state property law leads to delay and often poorly-reasoned decisions. I propose, therefore, a new analysis that eliminates consideration of state property rights from the NLRB’s right-to-access cases. Under my proposal, which I argue is more faithful to the Supreme Court’s Lechmere doctrine than the current analysis, the NLRB would focus on whether the manner in which an employer excludes organizers chills employee rights, while property issues—such as a trespass claim against organizers—would be determined by state courts. By creating a set of presumptions to guide employer attempts to exclude, the proposal would provide clarity for all parties, better protect employees’ labor rights, and free the NLRB from its struggles with state property law...|$|E
40|$|Danish men {{only take}} the {{equivalent}} of 8 % of the total parental leave, which is a considerably low percentage compared {{to the rest of}} the Nordic countries. In Sweden, Norway and Iceland earmarked parental leave are given to all fathers, this means that a specific period of time of two-three months are reserved for the fathers and cannot be used by the mothers. This thesis aims to examine why Denmark is the only country in Scandinavia that has not legislated earmarked parental leave in favor of men. Therefore, the focus of this thesis is not equality in favor of women, but equality in favor of men. The law as it is today makes men poorer than women with regards to their rights to be with their children. So the question is: Do fathers have the right to spend focused time with their children when they are still newborn babies? In Denmark the debate about earmarked parental leave for men is often reduced to a matter of coercion or liberty and is rarely about parental leave as <b>a</b> <b>right,</b> <b>an</b> entitlement in favor of men, their marriage or their relation with their children. To understand this we have examined how four chosen fathers experienced their opportunities and barriers in the process of choosing to take, or not to take parental leave. By interviewing these four men we found that men's masculinity, their family and professional life are major influences on the choices they make and for that reason, our analysis is centered on those topics. We will argue that men's understanding of their masculinity, ideals about their fatherly roles and the conditions of their working life are parameters that affect each other and are important for the selection and rejection of parental leave. Finally we will discuss how all of this can help clarify whether men experience a right to take parental leave and thereby we can explore some of the reasons why it is so problematic to introduce earmarked parental leave for men in Denmark. ...|$|E
