40|$|We {{introduce}} Dynamic Deep Neural Networks (D 2 NN), a {{new type}} of feed-forward deep neural network that allows selective execution. Given an input, only a subset of D 2 NN neurons are executed, and the particular subset is determined by the D 2 NN itself. By pruning unnecessary computation depending on input, D 2 NNs provide a way to improve computational efficiency. To achieve dynamic selective execution, a D 2 NN augments a feed-forward deep neural network (directed acyclic graph of differentiable <b>modules)</b> with <b>controller</b> <b>modules.</b> Each <b>controller</b> <b>module</b> is a sub-network whose output is a decision that controls whether other modules can execute. A D 2 NN is trained end to end. Both regular and <b>controller</b> <b>modules</b> in a D 2 NN are learnable and are jointly trained to optimize both accuracy and efficiency. Such training is achieved by integrating backpropagation with reinforcement learning. With extensive experiments of various D 2 NN architectures on image classification tasks, we demonstrate that D 2 NNs are general and flexible, and can effectively optimize accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

40|$|Resource {{conflicts}} are inevitable on any shared infrastructure. In Software-Defined Networks (SDNs), different <b>controller</b> <b>modules</b> with diverse objectives may be {{installed on the}} SDN <b>controller.</b> Each <b>module</b> independently generates resource requests that may conflict with the objectives of a different module. For example, a <b>controller</b> <b>module</b> for maintaining high availability may want re-source allocations that require too much core network bandwidth and thus conflict with another module that aims to minimize core bandwidth usage. In such a situation, {{it is imperative to}} identify and install resource allocations that achieve network wide global objectives that may not be known to individual modules, e. g., high availability with acceptable bandwidth usage. This problem has re-ceived only limited attention, with most prior work focused on de-tecting, avoiding, and resolving rule-level conflicts in the context of OpenFlow. In this paper, we present an automatic resolution mechanism based on a family of voting procedures, and apply it to resolve re-source conflicts among SDN and cloud controller programs. We observe that the choice of appropriate resolution mechanism de-pends on two properties of the deployed modules: their precision and parity. Based on these properties, a network operator can apply a range of resolution techniques. We present two such techniques. Overall, our system promotes modularity and does not require each <b>controller</b> <b>module</b> to divulge its objectives or algorithms to other modules. We demonstrate the improvement in allocation qual-ity over various alternative resolution methods, such as static pri-orities or equal weight, round-robin decisions. Finally, we provide a qualitative comparison of this work to recent methods based on utility or currency...|$|R
