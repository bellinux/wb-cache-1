5|$|At its {{greatest}} extent in the 1950s, the highway extended north from Webberville through Owosso and St. Charles to a junction with M-46 between Hemlock and Shields. M-47 turned east along M-46, running concurrently with that highway to Saginaw Township. There M-47 turned north independently to a junction with US10, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>ran</b> concurrently with US10 into Saginaw. Once in the city, M-47 turned north along Bay Street {{out of town}} toward Bay City. M-47 joined US23 and followed it north of town. M-47 then ran separately to the state park before turning south and back into downtown Bay City, ending at the US23 business loop.|$|E

He initially demoted Fernando Alonso outside the top ten with his time, but the McLaren driver hit back with a time sufficient to move on. This left Magnussen, Daniil Kvyat, Gutiérrez, Romain Grosjean, Felipe Massa, and Sergio Pérez on the sidelines for Q3.|$|E

5|$|M-17 is an {{original}} state trunkline {{dating back to}} the 1919 signing of the system. On July 1, 1919, the highway started at M-11 in Berrien County in the southwestern Lower Peninsula and ran east to Detroit. The debut of the U.S. Highway System replaced most of M-17 with two different highways. From Watervliet to Ann Arbor, US12 replaced M-17; east of Ypsilanti to Detroit, US112 replaced M-17. The M-17 designation also replaced M-23 on Ecorse Road between Ypsilanti and Lincoln Park <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>ran</b> concurrently with US25 into Detroit. The Ann Arbor segment was rerouted along Boulevard Drive (now Stadium Boulevard) between US12 and US23.|$|E
5|$|The high intelligence, {{initiative}} and self-direction of Labradors in working roles is exemplified by dogs such as Endal, who during a 2001 emergency placed an unconscious {{human being in}} the recovery position, retrieved his mobile phone from beneath the car, fetched a blanket and covered him, barked at nearby dwellings for assistance, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>ran</b> to a nearby hotel to obtain help. A number of Labradors have also been taught to assist their owner in removing money and credit cards from ATMs with prior training.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{started a}} {{drive in the}} first quarter for 73yards which culminated with a seven-yard Christian Ponder pass to Preston Parker for the score. The two teams traded punts, and Terrapins running back Da'Rel Scott fumbled the ball on the Maryland 26-yard line. Seminole linebacker Derek Nicholson picked up the ball and ran it into the endzone to bring the score to 14–0. On the next possession, Chris Turner threw his first {{interception}} in five games. Florida State then went three-and-out and punted. Maryland drove for 53yards before another Turner pass was intercepted by Toddrick Verdell, who returned it for 34yards. Florida State quarterback Ponder completed a 17-yard pass to Parker, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>ran</b> it himself for 16yards to the Maryland five-yard line. Two Antone Smith rushes brought the score to 21–0at the half.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 1, with only the {{shattered}} remnants of E Company at hand, the US 9th Infantry Regiment, US 2nd Infantry Division had virtually no troops to defend Yongsan. Division commander Major General Lawrence B. Keiser in this emergency attached the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion to the regiment. The US 72nd Tank Battalion and the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company also were assigned positions close to Yongsan. The regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low hills that arched around Yongsan on the northwest. Disorganized US forces were ordered to pull back to Yongsan. The road to Miryang came south out of Yongsan, bent around the western tip of this mountain, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>ran</b> eastward along its southern base. In its position, they not only commanded the town but also its exit, the road to Miryang. North Koreans had also approached Yongsan from the south. That night North Korean soldiers crossed the low ground around Yongsan and entered the town from the south.|$|E
5|$|On the August 29, 2008 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Brianna debuted as Brie Bella and {{defeated}} Victoria. She quickly began a scripted rivalry with Victoria and Victoria's accomplice, Natalya, {{and had a}} series of matches against them. In each match, Brie would roll out of the ring and go underneath it, emerging and appearing revived, and then win the match. On the October 31 episode of SmackDown, when Brie went under the ring Victoria grabbed her legs, but a second pair of legs kicked her off, implying that a second person was under the ring. The following week on SmackDown, Brie picked up a win against Victoria <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>ran</b> under the ring to escape Natalya and Victoria, but Victoria and Natalya both reached for Brie under the ring, resulting in both Nicole and Brie being pulled out. The twins then attacked them and celebrated afterward. Nicole was then introduced as Nikki Bella. The twins had their first official match as a team on the November 21 episode of SmackDown, defeating Victoria and Natalya. They continued competing in tag team matches over the following months.|$|E
5|$|The Browns next {{beat the}} Los Angeles Dons 31–14 in Cleveland {{to extend their}} winning streak to seven games. The crowd of 71,134 people who {{attended}} the game on a sunny October day was a professional football record. Cleveland {{got off to a}} slow start, falling behind 7–3 at halftime. The Browns' only score in the first half came on a 49-yard Lou Groza field goal, then the fourth-longest kick in professional football history. A flurry of scoring {{at the end of the}} third quarter and in the fourth quarter, however, won Cleveland the game. Otto Graham passed 36 yards to end Dante Lavelli <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>ran</b> in a touchdown with less than three minutes left in the third. It was the first of four touchdowns in 14 minutes of play. Fullback Marion Motley ran in two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, one of them a 68-yard run that tied an AAFC record for a rush from scrimmage. The Browns won despite a strong ground attack by the Dons, who gained 274 yards of rushing. The Dons had 21 first downs compared to Cleveland's 10. Groza made all of his extra point attempts, extending his streak to 22 in a row.|$|E

5|$|When it was {{originally}} built, the Feather River Highway northeast from Oroville followed the present Oroville Dam Boulevard (County Route B2) to the present location of the Oroville Dam, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>ran</b> north and northeast alongside the North Fork Feather River along a route now covered by Lake Oroville. It left to the north on Dark Canyon Road, meeting the present alignment at Jarbo Gap. Since the old road would be flooded, a $14.8 million new alignment, much of it four lanes, was built around the west side; the Western Pacific Railroad was also relocated to a nearby alignment. The double-decker West Branch Bridge over the West Branch Feather River northwest of the dam, carrying the highway above the rail line, was dedicated on August 15, 1962. Three portions of SR 70 have been upgraded to freeways: north of SR 99 to Berry and Kempton Roads in the early 2010s; south from Marysville to the State Route 65 split in the mid-1950s, extended farther south in the late 1960s and late 2000s; and around downtown Oroville, built in the early 1960s. In 2004, SR 70 was upgraded to a four-lane expressway between Feather River Boulevard north of the Bear River and the Yuba/Sutter county line to the freeway portion south of McGowan Parkway. A freeway interchange was constructed in 2008 at Plumas Lake Boulevard {{for access to the}} Plumas Lake development previously served at an uncontrolled intersection with Plumas Arboga Road. The removal of this intersection effectively upgraded the expressway portion to freeway south to the Feather River Boulevard intersection. In the early 2010s, the last two-lane segment of SR 70 south of Marysville was expanded to a four-lane expressway, with a freeway section bypassing the small town of East Nicolaus to the west. In 2015, the interchange with Feather River Boulevard in Plumas Lake was opened to traffic, eliminating the last signalized intersection between Sacramento (with SR 99) and Marysville.|$|E
