40|$|AbstractGas-phase <b>acidities</b> of nucleosides, {{combined}} {{with the knowledge of}} deprotonation sites, could improve our understanding of chemical reactions to biological systems. In this paper, we mainly focus our attention on the influence of cation coordination on <b>acidities</b> of multiple sites in cytosine nucleosides. The <b>acidities</b> of multiple sites in M+-L (where L represents cytosine nucleosides and M+ is an alkali metal ion, including Li+, Na+ and K+) complexes have been investigated theoretically, employing B 3 LY P/ 6 − 311 ++G(d,p) basis sets. The geometrical characters, gas-phase <b>acidities,</b> sugar puckering and electronic properties of non-deprotonated and/or deprotonated complexes have been investigated. The shifted ΔHacidity values are a consequence of a combination of metal ion coordination to OH and NH groups and efficient stabilization of the deprotonated species. For instance, after complexation with Li+, Na+, and K+, the ΔHacidity of O 2 ′H of the cytidine molecule shifts from 346. 2 to 251. 6, 258. 0, and 275. 7  kcal mol− 1, respectively. Moreover, for a given coordination site, the metal ion changes the gap between the most and least acidic groups, with respect to that in neutral nucleosides. Such dependence of <b>acidities</b> on the coordination region of the metal ion suggests that <b>acidities</b> of active groups could be controlled by modulating the metal ion coordination site and the type of metal ion...|$|R

40|$|Cheese {{made from}} raw homogenized cream mixed with skimmilk (raw or pasteurized) {{commonly}} developed a rancid flavor {{early in the}} ripening, but the condition tended to disappear as ripening progressed, and eventually the cheese was not rancid and was more satisfactory in flayor than cheese made from pasteurized milk or from pasteurized homogenized cream mixed with pasteurized skimmilk.

Cheese made from pasteurized milk had very low fat <b>acidities</b> and lacked flavor, whereas cheese having definitely higher fat <b>acidities</b> commonly had more flavor. Raw milk cheese had lower fat <b>acidities</b> than that made from raw homogenized cream with skimmilk but somewhat higher <b>acidities</b> than that made from pasteurized homogenized cream with pasteurized skimmilk.

50|$|There {{exists a}} large corpus of data {{concerning}} acid strengths {{in aqueous solution}} (pKa values), and itis tempting to transfer this to other solvents. Such comparisons are, however, fraught with danger, as they only consider the effect of solvation on {{the stability of the}} hydrogen ion, while neglecting its effects on the stability of the other species involved in the equilibrium.Gas phase <b>acidities</b> (normally known as proton affinities) can be measured, and their relative order is often quite differentfrom that of the aqueous <b>acidities</b> of the corresponding acids. Few quantitative studies on <b>acidities</b> in nonaqueous solvents have been carried out, although some qualitative data are available.It appears that most acids which have a pKa value of less than 9 in water are indeed strong acids in liquid ammonia.
