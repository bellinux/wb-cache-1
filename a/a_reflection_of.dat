5|$|In Shahîd's judgment, the {{imprecision}} and unemphatic tone of Eusebius' passage at 6.34 is {{the major}} cause {{of the lack of}} scholarly consensus on Philip's Christianity. To Shahîd, Eusebius' wording choice is <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> his own lack of enthusiasm for Philip's Christianity, which is in turn <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> the special position Constantine held in his regards and in his written work. A number of scholars, following E. Schwartz, believe the later editions of Eusebius' Historia to have been extensively revised to adapt to the deterioration of Licinius in the public memory (and official damnatio memoriae) after Constantine deposed and executed him in 324–25. Passages of the Historia incompatible with Licinius' denigration were suppressed, and an account of the last years of his life was replaced with a summary of the Council of Nicaea. Shahîd suggests that, in addition to these anti-Licinian deletions, Eusebius also edited out favorable notices on Philip to better glorify Constantine's achievement.|$|E
