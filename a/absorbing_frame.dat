40|$|In this paper, the {{generation}} of 3 -D pseudo VSP data is dis-cussed and illustrated on a dataset. We start with a 3 -D shot record This shot record has been transformed to a pseudo VSP dataset The result is compared with a modeled VSP and integrated {{in combination with the}} slices from the 3 -O migrated volume of data. In combination, the integration of different datasets yields a better insight and understanding of the wave propagation and the various events originating from the complex subsurface model. Some 3 -D snapshots are shown to improve the data interpretation, further showing the wave propagation at different times. The model contains three layers where the uppermost layer is a water layer on top of an irregular layer and a dipping plane. Absorbing boundaries have been applied around the entire model. In Fig. 1 the volume of the 3 -D model is depicted (3 axes x. y. z are indicated). The dimensions of the model are xmax= 1000 m, ymax = 500 m and zmax 800 m including a 50 m = wide <b>absorbing</b> <b>frame</b> around the cube (see fig. 2 a; note that the <b>absorbing</b> <b>frame</b> around the model is not shown). The dis-tance between the gridpoints is 5 m in all directions. Notice that the model as depicted in Fig. 1 and 2 is displayed with a coarser grid than 5 m. Fig. 2 b shows the model with the upper-most water layer removed...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} frame and dyad gauge-independent {{formalism}} for the {{calculus of variations}} of functionals involving spinorial objects. As {{a part of this}} formalism, we define a modified variation operator which <b>absorbs</b> <b>frame</b> and spin dyad gauge terms. This formalism is applicable to both the standard spacetime (i. e., SL(2, C)) 2 -spinors as well as to space (i. e., SU(2, C)) 2 -spinors. We compute expressions for the variations of the connection and the curvature spinors...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution {{reflection}} seismic {{methods are}} an established non-destructive tool for engineering tasks. In the near surface, shear-wave reflection seismic measurements usually offer a higher spatial {{resolution in the}} same effective signal frequency spectrum than P-wave data, but data quality varies more strongly. To discuss the causes of these differences, we investigated a P-wave and a SH-wave seismic reflection profile measured at the same location {{on the island of}} Föhr, Germany and applied seismic reflection processing to the field data as well as finite-difference modelling of the seismic wave field. The simulations calculated were adapted to the acquisition field geometry, comprising 2 m receiver distance (1 m for SH wave) and 4 m shot distance along the 1. 5 km long P-wave and 800 m long SH-wave profiles. A Ricker wavelet and the use of <b>absorbing</b> <b>frames</b> were first-order model parameters. The petrophysical parameters to populate the structural models down to 400 m depth were taken from borehole data, VSP (vertical seismic profile) measurements and cross-plot relations. The simulation of the P-wave wave-field was based on interpretation of the P-wave depth section that included a priori information from boreholes and airborne electromagnetics. Velocities for 14 layers in the model were derived from the analysis of five nearby VSPs (v P = 1600 – 2300 m s - 1). Synthetic shot data were compared with the field data and seismic sections were created. Major features like direct wave and reflections are imaged. We reproduce the mayor reflectors in the depth section of the field data, e. g. a prominent till layer and several deep reflectors. The SH-wave model was adapted accordingly but only led to minor correlation with the field data and produced a higher signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, we suggest to consider for future simulations additional features like intrinsic damping, thin layering, or a near-surface weathering layer. These may lead {{to a better understanding of}} key parameters determining the data quality of near-surface shear-wave seismic measurements...|$|R

The <b>frame</b> of the new Triton uses enlarged cross sections to increase frame rigidity (70% higher bending rigidity and 50% higher to rational rigidity than the previous generation), improving cabin safety and straight-line stability while reducing body vibration.

The experimental program included ten small-scale single-story single bay frames. The tests constitute one phase of study of the interaction of frames with filler walls in multi-story buildings.

40|$|A {{hydraulic}} breaker for construction machinery generally {{used for the}} destroying and disassembling of buildings, crashing road pavement, breaking rocks at quarry and so on. So the measurement of the impact energy of a {{hydraulic breaker}} is very important thing to prove its capability to manufacturers and customers. In this study, the test system for measuring the impact energy of a hydraulic breaker was designed and constructed. The test system was consisted with hydraulic cylinders for mounting a breaker, impact <b>absorbing</b> base and <b>frames,</b> pressure and flow sensors, high speed and accurate data acquisition system, diesel engine driven hydraulic power pack and etc. The test process of the developed system was carried by measuring guide for tool energy rating for hydraulic breakers which {{was developed by the}} CIMA (Construction Industry Manufacturers Association) USA. The developed test system can be applied to measure the impact energy for various kind of hydraulic breakers...|$|R
40|$|Video object {{detection}} is {{more challenging}} compared to image object detection. Previous works proved that applying object detector {{frame by frame}} is not only slow but also inaccurate. Visual clues get weakened by defocus and motion blur, causing failure on corresponding frames. Multi-frame feature fusion methods proved effective in improving the accuracy, but they dramatically sacrifice the speed. Feature propagation based methods proved effective in improving the speed, but they sacrifice the accuracy. So {{is it possible to}} improve speed and performance simultaneously? Inspired by how human utilize impression to recognize objects from blurry frames, we propose Impression Network that embodies a natural and efficient feature aggregation mechanism. In our framework, an impression feature is established by iteratively <b>absorbing</b> sparsely extracted <b>frame</b> features. The impression feature is propagated {{all the way down the}} video, helping enhance features of low-quality frames. This impression mechanism makes it possible to perform long-range multi-frame feature fusion among sparse keyframes with minimal overhead. It significantly improves per-frame detection baseline on ImageNet VID while being 3 times faster (20 fps). We hope Impression Network can provide a new perspective on video feature enhancement. Code will be made available. Comment: Tech Repor...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{a new technique}} for using geodetic data to update a priori predictions for Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) in the Fennoscandia region. Global Positioning System (GPS), tide gauge, and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity rates are assimilated into our model. The technique allows us to investigate the individual contributions from these data sets to the output GIA model in a self‐consistent manner. Another benefit of the technique {{is that we are}} able to estimate uncertainties for the output model. These are reduced with each data set assimilated. Any uncertainties in the GPS reference <b>frame</b> are <b>absorbed</b> by reference <b>frame</b> adjustments that are estimated as part of the assimilation. Our updated model shows a spatial pattern and magnitude of peak uplift that is consistent with previous models, but our location of peak uplift is slightly to the east of many of these. We also simultaneously estimate a spatially averaged rate of local sea level rise. This regional rate (∼ 1. 5 mm/yr) is consistent for all solutions, regardless of which data sets are assimilated or the magnitude of a priori GPS reference frame constraints. However, this is only the case if a uniform regional gravity rate, probably representing errors in, or unmodeled contributions to, the low‐degree harmonic terms from GRACE, is also estimated for the assimilated GRACE data. Our estimated sea level rate is consistent with estimates obtained using a more traditional approach of direct “correction” using collocated GPS and tide gauge sites...|$|R
40|$|Previous surveys for HI 21 -cm {{absorption}} in z > 0. 1 radio {{galaxies and}} quasars yield a 40 % detection rate, which {{is attributed to}} unified schemes of active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this paradigm absorption is only witnessed in (close to) type- 2 objects, where the central obscuration is viewed (nearly) edge-on and thus <b>absorbs</b> the rest <b>frame</b> 1420 MHz emission along our sight-line. However, we find this mix of detections and non-detections to only apply at low redshift (z 3 radio sources we find no 21 -cm absorption, indicating a low abundance of cold neutral gas in (the sight-lines searched in) these objects. Analysing the spectral energy distributions of these sources, we find that our high redshift selection introduces a bias where our sample consists exclusively of quasars with ultra-violet luminosities in excess of 10 e 23 W/Hz. This may suggest that we have selected a class of particularly UV bright type- 1 objects. Whatever the cause, {{it must also be}} invoked to explain the non-detections in an equal number of z 10 e 23 W/Hz. These objects also turn out to be quasars and, from these exclusive high UV luminosity [...] 21 -cm non-detections, it is apparent that orientation effects alone cannot account for the mix of 21 -cm detections and non-detections at any redshift.

40|$|Both {{climate change}} and water safety are {{textbook}} examples of wicked problems. Due to the ambiguous knowledge bases and contested values characterising these problems, frame differences among stakeholders and participants often result in severe political debate and not seldom evolve into controversies at and between different levels of governance, domains and scientific disciplines. An interesting exception {{appears to be the}} Dutch Second Delta Committee. In 2008 the committee presented twelve recommendations to the Dutch government on how to secure the Netherlands for severe flooding due to climate change. Despite the wicked nature of both {{climate change and}} water safety and the expensiveness of the recommended measures the committee succeeded surprisingly well in getting the new water management frame on the policy agenda without serious opposition or debate. In this paper we try to show how the dominant frame concerning water-safety issues in the Netherlands was influenced by the emerging climate change frame in the international media, policy and politics. By focussing on three different critical discourse moments we indicate how the existing Dutch water safety <b>frame</b> <b>absorbed</b> the climate change frame evolving into a new perspective on water safety which was successfully employed by the Second Delta Committee in tackling a classical wicked problem. Subsequently we show that with the recent fall of the climate change issue, this specific water safety frame evolved into a perspective disregarding climate change but remaining a wider timeframe indicating more political room to manoeuvre in times of budget cuts and increasing climate scepticism...|$|R
40|$|We explore {{relationships}} between BMI and skinfolds and anthropometric variables reflecting variation in lean body frame. Data {{on the middle}} class adult Australian women (n = 1260) collected in 2002 during a National Body Size and Shape Survey were used. Standard measurements of stature, weight, skeletal dimensions (shoulder width, hip width, chest width, and depth, limb lengths), circumferences of head, trunk, limbs and triceps, subscapular and abdominal skinfolds were taken. Techniques for measurements of skeletal frame minimized the inclusion of adipose tissue thickness. Analysis of variance and parametric and nonparametric correlations were used. Vertical dimensions show weak correlations with fatness, while body frame circumferences and transverse dimensions are consistently, significantly, and substantially correlated with fatness, each explaining from 3 to 44 % of variation in skinfold thickness. Skeletal dimensions explain up to 50 % of variation in skinfold thickness (multiple regression). Especially high correlations with skinfold thickness occur for chest width, depth, and hip width (r range from 0. 42 to 0. 66). Body frame dimensions reflect largely trunk volume and the trunk/limb proportions. Larger lean trunk size is associated with greater fatness. Since the size of the abdominal cavity, and thus the gastrointestinal system (GI), is reflected in the trunk size, we speculate that larger frame may predispose to obesity in two ways: (1) larger stomachs require greater bulk of food to produce feeling of satiety as mediated through antral distension, (2) larger GIs may <b>absorb</b> more nutrients. <b>Frame</b> size may help to detect the risk of obesity among young adults.
