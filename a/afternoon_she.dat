5|$|Kirchherr {{asked the}} Beatles {{if they would}} mind letting her take {{photographs}} {{of them in a}} photo session, which impressed them, as other groups had only snapshots that were taken by friends. The next morning Kirchherr took photographs with a Rolleicord camera, at a fairground in a municipal park called Hamburger Dom which was close to the Reeperbahn, and in the <b>afternoon</b> <b>she</b> took them all (minus Best, who decided not to go) to her mother's house in Altona. Kirchherr's bedroom (which was all in black, including the furniture, with silver foil on the walls and a large tree branch suspended from the ceiling), was decorated especially for Voormann, with whom she had a relationship, although after the visits to the Kaiserkeller their relationship became purely platonic. Kirchherr started dating Sutcliffe, although she always remained a close friend of Voormann.|$|E

25|$|How the Ben Seyr met {{her fate}} {{is a matter}} of conjecture. Having been seen at Rosslare, it may be presumed that having sailed for Cardiff on Wednesday <b>afternoon</b> <b>she</b> soon {{encountered}} heavy seas. Her cargo of loose oats may of ran forward in the hold, the weight putting her nose under the water, in which case she could have sunk in a matter of minutes. Conversely, she may have attempted to turn back and run for the shelter of the Irish Coast during the course of which she was swamped by the heavy seas - again her sinking would have followed quickly.|$|E

Residents warned her not to stay too long, noting the time as late <b>afternoon.</b> <b>She</b> passed four men at the railroad tracks and continued into the neighborhood, where she was later assaulted by some of those four and other men. At 7:30p.m., after dark, she went to Mary Wade's house for shelter, showing signs of an assault. The Wades called an ambulance for her.|$|E
25|$|On 10 November, Apollo chased a xebec and then, {{coming up}} on a brig, chased and {{captured}} her. The brig was Resolution, a sloop of war, of 18 guns and 149 men, {{under the command of}} Don Francisco Darrichena.

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 December, Bhutto met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. In the <b>afternoon,</b> <b>she</b> gave a speech at a PPP rally held in Rawalpindi's Liaquat National Bagh. On leaving in a {{bulletproof}} vehicle, she opened the car's escape hatch and stood up to wave to the surrounding crowds. A man stood within two to three metres of the car, fired three gunshots at her, and detonated a suicide vest packed with ball bearings. Bhutto was fatally injured; reports differ as to whether she was hit by bullets or by shrapnel from the explosion. Bhutto was rushed to Rawalpindi General Hospital, but was clinically dead on arrival and attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful. No autopsy was conducted, and the body was swiftly transported to Chaklala Air Base.

25|$|She {{was lost}} off Mangalore on 26 November 1780. The British were {{at war with}} Hyder Ali, Sultan of Mysore, and Vernon wanted to destroy Hyder Ali's small navy. When the {{squadron}} arrived off Callicut Road on 24 November a distant, ineffective engagement ensued. Although the British captured one of Hyder Ali's vessels, the remainder were anchored close to shore. Vernon ordered Simonton to lighten Sartine and move her closer. Simonton, noting that Sartine was already in only three fathoms, was not enthused, but followed orders and by the <b>afternoon</b> <b>she</b> was anchored in shallow water. However, it then became apparent that she was aground. By {{the afternoon of the}} next day she was gotten off after her crew threw some of her guns overboard. When she anchored in deeper water it was found that she was taking on water. Efforts were made on the 26th to stop the leaks, but they were futile. She flooded and was irrecoverable. Some of her sails, masts, and stores were rescued. The subsequent court martial absolved Simonton of all blame.|$|E
25|$|Before {{her next}} voyage, a {{virtually}} new crew had been signed on - {{of the crew}} of 47, only eight men {{had been on the}} previous voyage. This eight included Captain Grimstone and his three deck officers, the mate John Elliot, William Hickson the gun layer, two other gunners and the ship steward. On Friday 24 October, in the early afternoon the English Trader left the Thames for what would be her last voyage. By late <b>afternoon</b> <b>she</b> had reached Southend on Sea. Here the Thames estuary was wide enough for convoys to form up in relative safety. Convoy EC90 was made up of 20 ocean-going freighters, two or three coastal steamers and two Royal Navy destroyers, one of which was the ageing HMS Vesper. Convoy EC90 set off on its voyage in single file to start with, proceeding at a steady eight knots. For the English Trader this was close to her maximum speed with a crew who knew how to get the best from her, which the new crew did not. The convoy's route took it up the east coast of England and around the top of Scotland and down into the Atlantic Ocean. The English Channel was far too hazardous for shipping convoys {{at this stage of the}} war. By 3 pm, the English Trader's troubles had begun. She had been running sluggishly, which had been noticed by the crew members from previous voyages. She was now a least a half a mile behind the bulk of the convoy and HMS Vesper was enquiring for the reasons for the poor speed of the ship. The speculation from the more experienced crew members was that the English Traders coal-fired boilers, which were forced draught fed, required the booster fans to be precisely set. It was agreed that the ill-experienced new crew and the new chief engineer were unable to accomplish this. The captain was told by the commodore aboard the Vesper that if she could not regain her position in the convoy by nightfall she should make for harbour at one of the east coast ports.|$|E
