5|$|The chapter {{asserts that}} the king should be truthful, avoid anger, be virtuous and lead by example. The king, ministers and {{citizens}} should, states the Manasollasa's first sub-book, refrain from injury to others, practice self-restraint and generosity, have faith in gods, feed and support the poor <b>and</b> <b>helpless,</b> and be friendly. The king, according to the text, should honour his ancestors and all guests.|$|E
5|$|Females den {{in hollow}} trees. Kits are born blind <b>and</b> <b>helpless.</b> They are {{partially}} covered with fine hair. Kits begin to crawl after about 3 weeks. After about 7 weeks they open their eyes. They start to climb after 8 weeks. Kits are completely {{dependent on their}} mother's milk for the first 8–10 weeks, after which they begin {{to switch to a}} solid diet. After 4 months, kits become intolerant of their litter mates, and at 5 months, the mother pushes them out on their own. After one year, juveniles will have established their own range.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches are monogamous. The female {{produces}} {{eggs that}} are white with red or yellow markings; the clutch size varies, tending {{to be larger}} for northern species. The eggs are incubated for 12 to 18 days by the female alone, or by both parents, depending on the species. The altricial (naked <b>and</b> <b>helpless)</b> chicks take between 21 and 27 days to fledge. Both parents feed the young, {{and in the case}} of two American species, brown-headed and pygmy, helper males from the previous brood may assist the parents in feeding.|$|E

5|$|In Nischindipur, rural Bengal, in the 1910s, Harihar Roy (Kanu Banerjee) earns a meagre {{living as}} a pujari (priest), but dreams of a better career as a poet and playwright. His wife Sarbajaya (Karuna Banerjee) takes care of their children, Durga (Uma Dasgupta) and Apu (Subir Banerjee), and Harihar's elderly cousin, Indir Thakrun (Chunibala Devi). Because of their limited resources, Sarbajaya resents having to share her home with the old <b>and</b> <b>helpless</b> cripple Indir. At times, Sarbajaya's taunts become offensive, forcing Indir to take {{temporary}} refuge {{in the home of}} another relative. Durga is fond of Indir and often gives her fruit she has stolen from a wealthy neighbour's orchard. One day, the neighbour's wife accuses Durga of stealing a bead necklace (which Durga denies) and blames Sarbajaya for encouraging her tendency to steal.|$|E
5|$|The typical clutch size is two eggs, 20.3 × 15.1mm in size, {{which are}} pale blueish green with red or brown splotches that are {{concentrated}} around the wider end. Both sexes share the incubation duties, with each parent incubating for stints of around 25minutes before being relieved. This species is extremely territorial around the nest, chasing away other birds, including brindled white-eyes, rufous fantails, and other golden white-eyes. From laying {{it takes about}} two weeks for the eggs to hatch. The hatchlings are altricial, in other words naked <b>and</b> <b>helpless.</b> Both parents share the brooding and feeding duties, and take away faecal sacs to keep the nest clean. The diet of the chicks is almost exclusively composed of insects and caterpillars. Chicks fledge around 1014 days after hatching. After fledging they may remain with their parents in small groups for some time.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} looked set {{to improve}} in spring {{when the new}} Caliph, Umar II (r. 717–720), sent two fleets to the besiegers' aid: 400 ships from Egypt under a commander named Sufyan and 360 ships from Africa under Izid, all laden with supplies and arms. At the same time, a fresh army began marching through Asia Minor {{to assist in the}} siege. When the new fleets arrived in the Sea of Marmara, they kept their distance from the Byzantines and anchored on the Asian shore. The Egyptians were in the Gulf of Nicomedia near modern Tuzla and the Africans south of Chalcedon (at Satyros, Bryas and Kartalimen). Most of the Arab fleets' crews were composed of Christian Egyptians, however, and they began deserting to the Byzantines upon their arrival. Notified by the Egyptians of the advent and disposition of the Arab reinforcements, Leo launched his fleet in an attack against the new Arab fleets. Crippled by the defection of their crews, <b>and</b> <b>helpless</b> against Greek fire, the Arab ships were destroyed or captured along with the weapons and supplies they carried. Constantinople was now safe from a seaborne attack. On land too the Byzantines were victorious: their troops managed to ambush the advancing Arab army under a commander named Mardasan and destroy it in the hills around Sophon, south of Nicomedia.|$|E

25|$|According to a 1998 {{report by}} the U.S. Department of Commerce, the chief {{barriers}} to female education in India are inadequate school facilities (such as sanitary facilities), shortage of female teachers and gender bias in the curriculum (female characters being depicted as weak <b>and</b> <b>helpless).</b>|$|E
25|$|The Jesuit priests Thomas Falkner and Florian Paucke {{visited the}} region in the mid 18th century and {{described}} the area plenty of herds of feral cattle and horses roaming free on the plains and numerous packs of dogs that feed on them and sometimes attacked the unwarned <b>and</b> <b>helpless</b> travelers.|$|E

25|$|The Persian Shah is {{the ruler}} of Persia (by the book's {{chronology}} probably Naser al-Din Shah Qajar). He is depicted as being rather self-centered <b>and</b> <b>helpless.</b> He is largely a puppet of his mother, the khanum. He is a dangerous and powerful man, nonetheless, and Nadir worries very much for his and Erik's safety under the unstable favour of the shah.|$|E
25|$|Ethnic prejudices {{have also}} {{emerged in the}} drug war, and poor <b>and</b> <b>helpless</b> {{indigenous}} communities have been targeted by the police, military, drug traffickers and the justice system. According to the National Human Rights Commission (Mexico) (Comisión Nacional de los Derechos Humanos-CNDH), nearly one-third of the indigenous prisoners in Mexico in 2001 were in prison for federal crimes, which are mostly drug-related.|$|E
25|$|Public {{transportation}} and utilities unavoidably failed, {{owing to the}} shortage of fuel and through the augmentation of American air raids on Hong Kong. Tens {{of thousands of people}} became homeless <b>and</b> <b>helpless,</b> and many of them were employed in shipbuilding and construction. In the agricultural field, the Imperial Japanese took over the race track at Fanling and the air strip at Kam Tin for their rice-growing experiments.|$|E

25|$|The davidic ethic: It is {{the strongest}} qualities of preudomme derived by clerics from Biblical tradition. Originally it was a set of {{expectations}} of good rulership articulated by the Frankish church which involved the rightful authority based on protection for the weak <b>and</b> <b>helpless</b> (in particular the Church), respect for widows and orphans, and opposition to the cruel and unjust. The core of Davidic ethic is benevolence of the strong toward the weak.|$|E
25|$|The chicks of passerines are altricial: blind, featherless, <b>and</b> <b>helpless</b> when hatched {{from their}} eggs. Hence, the chicks require {{extensive}} parental care. Most passerines lay coloured eggs, {{in contrast with}} nonpasserines, most of whose eggs are white except in some ground-nesting groups such as Charadriiformes and nightjars, where camouflage is necessary, and in some parasitic cuckoos, which match the passerine host's egg. Vinous-throated parrotbill has two egg colours, white and blue. This can prevent the brood parasitic Common cuckoo.|$|E

Noriko declines, explaining that she doesn't wish to marry anyone, because to do so would leave her father alone <b>and</b> <b>helpless.</b> Masa surprises Noriko by claiming that she is also trying to arrange a match between Shukichi and Mrs. Miwa (Kuniko Miyake), an attractive young widow known to Noriko.

25|$|Agoraphobia occurs {{about twice}} as {{commonly}} among women {{as it does in}} men. The gender difference may be attributable to several factors: sociocultural traditions that encourage, or permit, the greater expression of avoidance coping strategies by women (including dependent <b>and</b> <b>helpless</b> behaviors), women perhaps being more likely to seek help and therefore be diagnosed, and men being more likely to abuse alcohol in reaction to anxiety and be diagnosed as an alcoholic. Research has not yet produced a single clear explanation for the gender difference in agoraphobia.|$|E
25|$|On June 8, Dr. Douglas {{warned the}} {{authorities}} of Quebec and Montreal that an epidemic {{was about to}} strike. On the previous Sunday between 4,000 and 5,000 'healthy' had left Grosse Isle, of whom Dr. Douglas estimated two thousand would develop fever within three weeks. Thousands were being discharged into Montreal, weak <b>and</b> <b>helpless,</b> some crawling {{because they could not}} walk, others 'lying on the wharves, dying'. Immigrants in Quebec were described as 'emaciated objects' huddled 'in the doors of churches, the wharves and the streets, apparently in the last stages of disease and famine'.|$|E
25|$|West Midlands Police {{struggled}} {{to operate on}} the estate due to recurring incidents and also incidents where officers were attacked by youths. The lack of law enforcement led to the residents feeling intimidated <b>and</b> <b>helpless</b> on the estate. In the 1980s, the police tried an alternative approach called Community Policing where hot spots for crime were tackled with more officers. The scheme received national attention but was considered to not be drastic {{enough to deal with}} the problems on the estate. By 1992, 41% of residents said they were victims of crime and 55% said they were afraid to go out at night.|$|E
