5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{dissolve}} slowly in liquid ammonia, forming <b>ammoniacal</b> solutions of solvated M+ and e−, which {{react to form}} hydrogen gas and the alkali metal amide (MNH2, where M represents an alkali metal): this was first noted by Humphry Davy in 1809 and rediscovered by W. Weyl in 1864. The process may be speeded up by a catalyst. Similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent alkaline earth metals calcium, strontium, barium, {{as well as the}} divalent lanthanides, europium and ytterbium. The amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution, leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals. In 1907, Charles Krause identified the colour as being due to the presence of solvated electrons, which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions. At low concentrations (below 3 M), the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium chloride; at higher concentrations (above 3 M), the solution is copper-coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like mercury. In addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons, such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation (M+), the neutral alkali metal atom (M), diatomic alkali metal molecules (M2) and alkali metal anions (M−). These are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas. Solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often used in chemical synthesis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ammoniacal</b> {{nitrogen}} (NH3-N) is {{a measure}} commonly used for testing the quantity of ammonium ions, derived naturally from ammonia, and returned to ammonia via organic processes, in water or waste liquids. It {{is a measure}} used mainly for quantifying values in waste treatment and water purification systems, {{as well as a}} measure of the health of natural and man made water reserves. It is measured in units of mg/L (milligram per litre).|$|E
25|$|Ammonia is {{also found}} {{throughout}} the Solar System on Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, among other places: on smaller, icy planets such as Pluto, ammonia {{can act as a}} geologically important antifreeze, as a mixture of water and ammonia can potentially have a melting point of as low as 173 kelvins if the ammonia concentration is high enough and thus allow such planets to retain internal oceans and active geology at a far lower temperature than would be possible with water alone. Substances containing ammonia, or those that are similar to it, are called <b>ammoniacal.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Resorcinol {{crystallizes}} from benzene as colorless needles {{that are}} readily soluble in water, alcohol, and ether, but insoluble in chloroform and carbon disulfide. It reduces Fehling's solution and <b>ammoniacal</b> silver solutions. It does not form a precipitate with lead acetate solution, {{as does the}} isomeric pyrocatechol. Iron(III) chloride colors its aqueous solution a dark-violet, and bromine water precipitates tribromoresorcin. These properties are what give it its use as a colouring agent for certain chromatography experiments. Sodium amalgam reduces it to dihydroresorcin, which when heated to 150 to 160°C with concentrated barium hydroxide solution gives γ-acetylbutyric acid (D. Vorlgnder); when fused with potassium hydroxide, resorcinol yields phloroglucin, pyrocatechol, and diresorcin. It condenses with acids or acid chlorides, {{in the presence of}} dehydrating agents, to oxyketones, e.g., with zinc chloride and glacial acetic acid at 145°C it yields resacetophenone (HO)2C6H3~CO.CH3. With the anhydrides of dibasic acids, it yields fluoresceins. When heated with calcium chloride—ammonia to 200°C it yields meta-dioxydiphenylamine. With sodium nitrite it forms a water-soluble blue dye, which is turned red by acids, and is used as an indicator, under the name of lacmoid. [...] It condenses readily with aldehydes, yielding with formaldehyde, on the addition of catalytic hydrochloric acid, methylene diresorcin 2•CH2. Reaction with chloral hydrate in the presence of potassium bisulfate yields the lactone of tetra-oxydiphenyl methane carboxylic acid. In alcoholic solution it condenses with sodium acetoacetate to form 4-methylumbelliferone.|$|E

When shell-lac is put into <b>ammoniacal</b> gas its surface gradually acquires conducting power, {{and in this way}} the lac part of the stem within was so altered, that the ammonia apparatus could not retain a charge with sufficient steadiness to allow of division. In these experiments, therefore, the other apparatus was charged; its charge measured and divided with the ammonia apparatus by a quick contact, and what remained untaken away by the division again measured (1281.). It was so nearly one-half of the original charge, as to authorize, with this reservation, the insertion of <b>ammoniacal</b> gas amongst the other gases, as having equal power with them.|$|E

These products are, to a great extent, such as would result from the burning of so much wood.|$|E

And finally, in 1787, the Italian chemist, Fabroni, made the capital discovery that the yeast ferment, the presence of which is necessary to fermentation, is what he termed a [...] "vegeto-animal" [...] substance--or is a body which gives off <b>ammoniacal</b> salts when it is burned, and is, in other ways, similar to the gluten of plants and the albumen and casein of animals.|$|E
60|$|City {{and country}} are still so widely apart in every civilization {{that one can}} safely count upon a {{reciprocal}} strangeness in many every-day things. For instance, in the country, when people break up house-keeping, they sell their household goods and gods, {{as they did in}} cities fifty or a hundred years ago; but now in cities they simply store them; and vast warehouses in all the principal towns have been devoted to their storage. The warehouses are of all types, from dusty lofts over stores, and <b>ammoniacal</b> lofts over stables, to buildings offering acres of space, and carefully planned for the purpose. They are more or less fire-proof, slow-burning, or briskly combustible, like the dwellings they have devastated. But the modern tendency is to a type where flames do not destroy, nor moth corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal. Such a warehouse is a city in itself, laid out in streets and avenues, with the private tenements on either hand duly numbered, and accessible only to the tenants or their order. The aisles are concreted, the doors are iron, and the roofs are ceiled with iron; the whole place is heated by steam and lighted by electricity. Behind the iron doors, which in the New York warehouses must number hundreds of thousands, and throughout all our other cities, millions, the furniture of a myriad households is stored--the effects of people who have gone to Europe, or broken up house-keeping provisionally or definitively, or have died, or been divorced. They are the dead bones of homes, or their ghosts, or their yet living bodies held in hypnotic trances; destined again in some future time to animate some house or flat anew. In certain cases the spell lasts for many years, in others for a few, and in others yet it prolongs itself indefinitely.|$|E
