5|$|Beilhart {{rejected}} {{materialism and}} disavowed personal property. He held that jealousy, doubt, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> losing {{the love of}} another caused much of the disease people experienced. He felt that rejecting personal possessions was a means of attaining the Fruit of the Universal Spirit.|$|E
5|$|Jacob L. Beilhart (March 4, 1867 – November 24, 1908) was {{the founder}} and leader of a communitarian group known as the Spirit Fruit Society. Beilhart {{believed}} that jealousy, materialism, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> losing another's love were {{at the root of}} much of the illness in the world. Under his direction, the Spirit Fruit Society sought to model and practice those beliefs.|$|E
5|$|The Manhattan Project {{intelligence}} staff {{believed that}} the Japanese atomic program was not far advanced because Japan had little access to uranium ore, the industrial effort required exceeded Japan's capacity, and, according to American physicists at the University of California, Berkeley, who knew the leading Japanese physicists personally, there were too few Japanese qualified {{to work in the}} area. Conversely, German scientists had reputations as leaders in the field, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> Germany developing nuclear weapons first {{was one of the reasons}} for the establishment of the Manhattan Project. The Chancellor of Germany, Adolf Hitler, frequently claimed that Germany was developing secret weapons, and it was feared that these might include nuclear weapons. Reports of German nuclear activity were taken very seriously. At the instigation of the Manhattan Project, Norwegian saboteurs and Allied bombers attacked heavy-water infrastructure in German-occupied Norway in late 1942 and early 1943.|$|E

25|$|Parents {{had much}} {{less time for}} {{supervision}} of their children, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> juvenile delinquency was upon the land, especially as older teenagers took jobs and emulated their older siblings in the service. The government responded by requiring all youth over 16 to register, and expanded the number of clubs and organizations available to them.|$|E

Later, there were also minor interventions by some states against ISIL-affiliated groups in Nigeria and Libya.|$|E

25|$|The {{main reason}} people {{choose not to}} {{contribute}} to online communities surprisingly {{does not have to}} do with societal laziness, but in fact the potential contributors belief that their entries will not be taken seriously or given the credit that they deserve. When people assess the risks involved in contributing to online communities, they generally avoid participation because of the uncertainty of who the other contributors and readers are <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> their work being undervalued.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1880 {{the central}} {{government}} seldom responded to such projects, due to the weakness of Siberian enterprises, fear of Siberian territories' integration with the Pacific region rather than with Russia, and thus falling {{under the influence of}} the United States and Great Britain. The heavy and clumsy bureaucracy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> financial risks also contributed to the inaction: the financial system always underestimated the effects of the railway, assuming that it would take only the existing traffic.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Knox Anderson, also a New Zealander, saw the Depression end {{only to be}} {{followed}} four years later by World War II. During World War II, Scots and its student body relocated to a purpose built campus at Bathurst, {{to the west of}} the Great Dividing Range. This was due to the proximity of the Bellevue Hill campus to the coast, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> Japanese naval bombardment, a fear justified in May 1942 with the Japanese mini-sub attack on Sydney Harbour.|$|E

25|$|Military strongman Fulgencio Batista {{staged a}} coup on March 10, 1952, {{removing}} Carlos Prío Socarrás from power. Cubans in general were stunned, but remembering the bloodshed of the Batista's {{rule in the}} 1930s, they were reluctant to fight. Batista created a consultative council from pliable political personalities of all parties who appointed him President months before elections were to be held. Batista’s past democratic and pro-labor tendencies <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> another episode of bloody violence gained him tenuous support from the bankers, {{and the leader of}} the major labor confederation.|$|E
25|$|Enumeration of the sharecroppers {{and legal}} {{recording}} of their tenancy {{would have provided}} them with protection from eviction and exploitation under the existing laws itself. However, most bargadars did not know their rights under these laws, and, given their financial status, they were financially dependent on their landlords. Additionally, the long and tedious recording process, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> reprisals by the landlords meant that most bargadars did not record their names. Recording drives before Operation Barga had managed to record only 400,000, out of the estimated total of 2.2-2.5million bargadars.|$|E
25|$|In 1791, two representatives on mission {{informed}} the National Assembly of the disquieting condition of Vendée, and this news was quickly {{followed by the}} exposure of a royalist plot organized by the Marquis de la Rouerie. It {{was not until the}} social unrest <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> The Terror (a period between 1793–94 where {{tens of thousands of people}} were beheaded by use of guillotine) combined with the external pressures from the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790) and the introduction of a levy of 300,000 on the whole of France, decreed by the National Convention in February 1793, that the region erupted.|$|E

25|$|To {{add to the}} {{efficiency}} of the Israeli system - the reclaimed sewage water may be mixed with reclaimed sea water (Plans are in action to increase the desalinization program up to 50% of the countries usage by 2013 - 600 billion liters of drinkable sea water a year), along with aquifer water and fresh sweet lake water - monitored by computer to account for the nationwide needs and input. This action reduced the outdated risk of salt and mineral percentages in the water. Plans to implement this overall usage of reclaimed water for drinking are discouraged by the psychological preconception of the public for the quality of reclaimed water, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> its origin.|$|E
25|$|The {{incomplete}} {{success in}} stopping inflation created an extremely difficult policy conflict. Recovery could in principle be stimulated by more expansionary credit policies and lower interest rates, which would favor increased investment, depreciation {{of the currency}} to help producers compete against imports, and improved exports. But continuing inflation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> accelerating its rate of increase argued instead for keeping a very tight rein on credit and thereby blocked the actions needed for recovery. This conflict became particularly acute over {{the question of what}} to do about the exchange note: the real exchange rate went in exactly the wrong direction for recovery by appreciating when depreciation was both expected and needed.|$|E
25|$|After the war the Manning {{government}} passed {{several pieces}} of restrictive legislation that limited labor's ability to organize workers and to call strikes. The enforcement of labor law also reflected an anti-union bias. Social Crediters, {{who had a}} penchant for conspiracy theories, believed union militancy {{was the product of}} an international Communist conspiracy. Their labor legislation sought to foil the conspiracy's plans in Alberta and incidentally to reassure potential investors, particularly in the oil industry, of a good climate for profit taking. The path for such legislation was made smoother by the conservatism of one wing of the labor movement in the province <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> being tarnished with the Communist brush by the other wing.|$|E
50|$|The Doctor, when {{showing the}} entity his own fears, {{mentions}} his <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> future, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> {{things that he}} sees he himself might have to do.

25|$|After World War II, {{the balance}} of power between the Eastern and Western blocs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> global {{destruction}} prevented the further military use of atomic bombs. This fear was even a central part of Cold War strategy, referred to as the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction. So important was this balance to international political stability that a treaty, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (or ABM treaty), was signed by the U.S. and the USSR in 1972 to curtail the development of defenses against nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles that carry them. This doctrine resulted in a large {{increase in the number of}} nuclear weapons, as each side sought to ensure it possessed the firepower to destroy the opposition in all possible scenarios.|$|E
25|$|Other major {{problems}} concern {{the labor force}} and the pricing system. There is large-scale underemployment in both urban and rural areas, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> the disruptive effects of major, explicit unemployment is strong. The prices of certain key commodities, especially of industrial raw materials and major industrial products, {{are determined by the}} state. In most cases, basic price ratios were set in the 1950s and are often irrational in terms of current production capabilities and demands. Over the years, large subsidies were built into the price structure and these subsidies grew substantially in the late 1970s and 1980s. By the early 1990s, these subsidies began to be eliminated, in large part due to China's admission into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, which carried with it requirements for further economic liberalization and deregulation.|$|E
25|$|In {{some of the}} camps, food rations were {{scarce and}} medical care was inadequate. In 1945 alone, more than 13,000 people died, among them some 7,000 {{children}} under the age of five. The situation was worst in the months right before and after the capitulation, when Danish hospitals and doctors were reluctant to treat German refugees. The reason for this was not only anti-German resentment, but also lack of resources, the time needed to rebuild administrative structures, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> epidemic diseases which were highly prevalent among the refugees. Instead, Danish authorities established a camp-internal medical system with German medical personnel, which took some time to work adequately. In the camps, there was school education for children up to the upper secondary level, work duty for adults, study circles, theatre, music and self-issued German newspapers. After initial inadequacy, food rations became more sufficient.|$|E
50|$|The new emperor {{was only}} 10 years old, {{therefore}} his cousin, Empress Dowager Chu (Emperor Kang's wife), served as regent, but the decisions were actually {{being made by}} Xie An and Wang Tanzhi; Huan Wen, apparently fearful of being entrapped, declined an offer to be regent. In 373, Huan Wen died <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> a Huan usurpation dissipated as his brother and successor, Huan Chong, was committed {{to the survival of}} the imperial government.|$|R
50|$|An {{apocryphal}} story circulates online {{that tells}} of three ghosts {{living in the}} house furthest down the path. The story claims the rumors originated in 1912, when three young sisters all went camping deep in the woods, but did not return. Locals were only able to find their bonnets, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people caused almost half of the residents to move away. Those that remained never let their children go deep in the woods again without supervision.|$|R
