5|$|Despite the {{unsuccessful}} ventures against Philip and Alexander, the Athenians still respected Demosthenes. In 336BC, the orator Ctesiphon {{proposed that}} Athens honour Demosthenes {{for his services}} to the city by presenting him, according to custom, with a golden crown. This proposal became a political issue and, in 330BC, Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon on charges of legal irregularities. In his most brilliant speech, On the Crown, Demosthenes effectively defended Ctesiphon and vehemently attacked those who would have preferred peace with Macedon. He was unrepentant <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>past</b> actions and policies and insisted that, when in power, the constant aim of his policies was the honour and the ascendancy of his country; and on every occasion and in all business he preserved his loyalty to Athens. He finally defeated Aeschines, although his enemy's objections to the crowning were arguably valid from a legal point of view.|$|E

5|$|Vanilla Ice took an {{interest}} in the musical style found on Hard to Swallow while performing {{as a member of a}} Miami grunge band, and was able to develop this sound through a friendship with producer Ross Robinson, with whom he shared {{an interest}} in motocross racing. Robinson produced the album after being advised against working with Vanilla Ice.

5|$|Lace was {{released}} from Dartmoor in July 1987 and settled in nearby Brixham, Devon, returning to visit family in Portsmouth in 1988. He intimated that he was depressed <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>past</b> actions and in December 1988 gave away his possessions and resigned from his job. He was last seen by friends between 7–8 December and was found dead by his landlord on 9December. Postmortem examination revealed superficial wounds to his wrist, ingestion of analgesics and a plastic bag over his head. The {{cause of death was}} determined to be asphyxiation and his death was determined as suicide by the coroner. Lace was buried in Kingston Cemetery, Portsmouth on 20December 1988. After a cross check on the DNA database found that the DNA from the murder scene showed a partial match with that of a relative of Lace, detectives requested a sample from Andrina Foster, Lace's biological sister, which gave a familial match with the murderer's DNA. As a result of this development, Lace's body was exhumed on 12 August 2009 for DNA testing as part of Operation Iceberg.|$|E
