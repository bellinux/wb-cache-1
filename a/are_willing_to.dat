5|$|Meth {{mouth is}} very {{difficult}} to treat unless the patient stops using methamphetamine; persistent drug use makes changes in hygiene or nutrition practices unlikely. Many drug users lack access to dental treatment, and few <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> participate in such a course of action, often because of poverty. Those who <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> seek dental treatment often resist discussing their drug use. Providing dental treatment to individuals who use methamphetamine can also be dangerous, because the potential combination of local anesthetic and methamphetamine can cause serious heart problems. There is also an increased risk of serious side effects if opioid medications are used in the patient's treatment.|$|E

Of the patients who stated that they would pay out-of-pocket for the procedure, the median (IQR) amount they <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay <b>was</b> $ 750.00 (1500.00). Moreover, when {{patients were}} asked if they would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> travel outside of Canada and pay out-of-pocket to have an ACLR, 41 (16.4 %) said yes, 151 (60.4 %) said no, and 58 (23.2 %) said that they were unsure. If patients stated they <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay to travel outside of Canada to have the procedure performed, the median (IQR) amount they <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for this option was $ 2500.00 (3750.00). Further, patients who <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> travel outside of Canada for an expedited ACLR <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay a median (IQR) amount of $ 2000.00 (2000.00) out-of-pocket to have the procedure done in Canada, whereas patients who were unwilling to travel outside of Canada <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay $ 600.00 (625.00) out-of-pocket to have the procedure done in Canada, and this difference was statistically significant (p[*]<[*] 0.000).

The other factors must be controlled to mitigate the overall stress on the diver and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety. The equipment is critical to diver safety for life support, but is generally reliable, controllable and predictable in its performance.|$|E

5|$|Companies {{object to}} being blamed for shark bite incidents, {{pointing}} out that lightning tends to strike humans more often than sharks bite humans. Their position is that further {{research needs to be}} done before banning practices such as chumming, which may alter natural behavior. One compromise is to only use chum in areas where whites actively patrol anyway, well away from human leisure areas. Also, responsible dive operators do not feed sharks. Only sharks that <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> scavenge follow the chum trail and if they find no food at the end then the shark soon swims off and does not associate chum with a meal.

5|$|There {{are many}} {{stakeholders}} {{in many countries}} such as The United States who report several concerns in the usage of rules-based accounting. According to recent studies, many believe that the principles-based approach in financial reporting would not only improve but would also support an auditor upon dealing with client’s pressure.

However, as a new chairperson of the SEC takes over the system, the transition brings a stronger review about {{the pros and cons}} of rules- based accounting.

5|$|A small {{ministry}} of defence (which was renamed the Ministry of Defence and Security in 2007) was established in 2002 to provide civilian oversight of the F-FDTL. A lack of suitable staff for the ministry and the close political relationship between senior F-FDTL officers and government figures rendered this oversight largely ineffectual and retarded the development of East Timor's defence policy up to at least 2004. The failure to institute effective civilian oversight of the F-FDTL also limited {{the extent to which}} foreign countries <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> provide assistance to the F-FDTL and contributed to the 2006 crisis. As at early 2010 the Ministry of Defence and Security was organised into elements responsible for defence (including the F-FDTL) and security (including the PNTL), each headed by their own secretary of state. At this time the East Timorese Government was working to expand the ministry's capacity with assistance from UNMIT, but continuing shortages of qualified staff limited {{the extent to which the}} ministry could provide civilian oversight to the security sector. Moreover, elements of the F-FDTL were continuing to resist civilian control over the security forces at this time, and the force had not opened itself to international scrutiny.|$|E
