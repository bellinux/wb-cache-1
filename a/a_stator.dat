5|$|Although closed, {{the line}} was not lifted, and was {{maintained}} as a long siding until 1972, {{on behalf of the}} Central Electricity Generating Board, who paid for its maintenance. This was to facilitate the maintenance of the stators from Keadby Power Station, which were too heavy to be transported over the bridge where the A161 road crossed the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. When required, the heavy haulage company Pickfords would move <b>a</b> <b>stator</b> by road to Ealand depot, to the south of Crowle. It would then be loaded onto the railway, and moved across the canal to Belton, where it would be transferred back to the road vehicle. The A161 road bridge was replaced by Lindsey County Council in 1970, and the complicated manoeuvres became unnecessary. Consequently, the rails were removed in 1972.|$|E
5|$|As protons {{cross the}} {{membrane}} through the channel {{in the base}} of ATP synthase, the FO proton-driven motor rotates. Rotation might be caused by changes in the ionization of amino acids in the ring of c subunits causing electrostatic interactions that propel the ring of c subunits past the proton channel. This rotating ring in turn drives the rotation of the central axle (the γ subunit stalk) within the α and β subunits. The α and β subunits are prevented from rotating themselves by the side-arm, which acts as <b>a</b> <b>stator.</b> This movement of the tip of the γ subunit within the ball of α and β subunits provides the energy for the active sites in the β subunits to undergo a cycle of movements that produces and then releases ATP.|$|E

25|$|The Éolienne Bollée is {{an unusual}} wind turbine, unique for having <b>a</b> <b>stator</b> and a rotor, as a water turbine has. The eponymous {{invention}} was first patented in 1868 by Ernest Sylvain Bollée in France. A further patent dated 1885 differed mainly in two ways: First, in how the turbine was {{turned to face the}} wind and second, in an improvement which increased the flow of wind through the turbine was added. The turbines built according to the 1885 patent were commercially successful.|$|E
25|$|By {{designing}} the fan blades with proper hub-to-tip ratio and analyzing {{performance on the}} number of blades so that the flow doesn't separate on the blade surface these effects can be reduced. Some of the methods to overcome these effects are re-circulation of excess air through the fan, axial fans are high specific speed devices operating them at high efficiency and to minimize the effects they have to be operated at low speeds. For controlling and directing the flow use of guide vanes is suggested. Turbulent flows at the inlet and outlet of the fans cause stalling so the flow should be made laminar by the introduction of <b>a</b> <b>stator</b> to prevent the effect.|$|E
25|$|As {{the fluid}} enters and {{leaves in the}} axial direction, the {{centrifugal}} component in the energy equation does not come into play. Here the compression is fully based on diffusing action of the passages.The diffusing action in stator converts absolute kinetic head of the fluid into rise in pressure. The relative kinetic head in the energy equation is a term that exists {{only because of the}} rotation of the rotor. The rotor reduces the relative kinetic head of the fluid and adds it to the absolute kinetic head of the fluid i.e., the impact of the rotor on the fluid particles increases its velocity (absolute) and thereby reduces the relative velocity between the fluid and the rotor. In short, the rotor increases the absolute velocity of the fluid and the stator converts this into pressure rise. Designing the rotor passage with a diffusing capability can produce a pressure rise in addition to its normal functioning. This produces greater pressure rise per stage which constitutes <b>a</b> <b>stator</b> and a rotor together. This is the reaction principle in turbomachines. If 50% of the pressure rise in a stage is obtained at the rotor section, it is said to have a 50% reaction.|$|E

2500|$|The {{pneumatic}} siren, {{which is}} a free aerophone, consists of a rotating disk with holes in it (called a chopper, siren disk or [...] ), such that the material between the holes interrupts a flow of air from fixed holes {{on the outside of}} the unit (called <b>a</b> <b>stator).</b> As the holes in the rotating disk alternately prevent and allow air to flow it results in alternating compressed and rarefied air pressure, i.e. sound.
