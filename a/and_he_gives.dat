25|$|The partly autobiographical Lykke-Per (1898–1904) (Lucky Per), {{perhaps his}} most famous novel, deals with the self-confident, richly gifted man who breaks with his {{religious}} family {{in order to be}} an engineer and a conqueror, free of heritage and milieu.

25|$|In the narrative, {{just prior}} to this test, when Joseph had first met all of his {{brothers}} (but not identified himself to them), he had held a feast for them; the narrative heavily implies that Benjamin was Joseph's favorite brother, since he is overcome with tears when he first meets Benjamin in particular, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> Benjamin {{five times as much}} food as he apportions to the others. According to textual scholars, this is really the Jahwist's account of the reunion after Joseph identifies himself, and the account of the threat to enslave Benjamin is just the Elohist's version of the same event, with the Elohist being more terse about Joseph's emotions towards Benjamin, merely mentioning that Benjamin was given five times as many gifts as the others.|$|E
25|$|Carrie {{asks her}} {{contacts}} {{for information on}} an underground doctor {{in the area where}} Quinn went missing. Following a tip from former Hezbollah commander Al-Amin (George Georgiou), she tracks down one of the cell's supporters, Dr. Hussein (Mehdi Nebbou).

Saul asks Carrie to rejoin the CIA, but she declines his offer. Düring essentially proposes to her, giving her a chance to co-head his Foundation. She does not answer him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> her time to think about it.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} he began the serial, Seth had {{developed}} a style derivative of The New Yorker stylists of the 1930s and 1940s. [...] In the book's appendix Seth describes Peter Arno as [...] "possibly The New Yorkers greatest stylist". [...] Seth appropriates the sophisticated, jaded satirical mood, thick brushline, and compositional sense of Arno's work. [...] Seth's brushline is simple and organic, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> attention to buildings, landscapes, weather conditions, and other background details. [...] The brushstrokes broaden into thick black shadows, sometimes flattening figures to near-abstract silhouettes. [...] A greyish-blue wash accents the otherwise black-and-white cartooning. The novel is printed on yellow paper, giving an aged feeling to the book.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{back in the}} office, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) gives Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) a [...] "Dwight" [...] bobblehead doll, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> her a key to his home.

At the end of the day, Jim tells Pam [...] "Happy Valentine's Day" [...] and she watches him longingly as he leaves.|$|E
500|$|Carradine {{enjoyed a}} revival of his fame when he was cast in Quentin Tarantino's {{sequential}} Kill Bill [...] movies, in 2003 and 2004. Among those who thought his portrayal of Bill, the assassin extraordinaire, would earn him an Academy Award nomination was Scott Mantz, of The Mediadrome, who said, [...] "Carradine practically steals every scene he's in with confident gusto, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> a soulful performance that should all but ensure a spot on next year's Oscar ballot." [...] Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper each had Kill Bill Vol. 2 on their top ten list for of Academy Awards predictions. Although the films received no notice from the Academy, Carradine did receive a Golden Globe nomination and a Saturn Award, for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Bill.|$|E

They {{walk off}} into the forest, and Michael asks her if she would be [...] "his girl"; she accepts <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> her a ring. He warns her, however, that he is [...] "different". A full moon appears, and Michael begins convulsing in agony, {{transforming}} into a werewolf. His date runs away in terror, but the werecat catches up to her, knocking her down and begins lunging at her with his claws. He also knocks down a tree. The scene then cuts to a modern-day movie theater where Michael and his date, along with a repulsed audience, are actually watching the scene unfold in a movie called Thriller.|$|E
500|$|The game {{begins as}} Garrett {{continues}} {{his life as}} a thief. However, he is ambushed while returning to his apartment after an early mission, and he determines that Truart, the local sheriff, is hunting him. Keepers take Garrett to hear a prophecy about the [...] "Metal Age", which he ignores. As Garrett leaves, one of the Keepers informs him that Truart had been hired to kill him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> Garrett a letter that directs him to eavesdrop on a Mechanist meeting. There, Garrett overhears Truart and Father Karras discussing the conversion of street people into mindless [...] "Servants", who wear masks that emit a red vapor capable of reducing themselves and nearby humans to rust. Truart promises to provide Karras with twenty victims for the Servant project, not realizing that Karras is recording his words for use in blackmail.

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave El Concierto 4.5 out of 5 stars, {{praising the}} {{inclusion}} of the mariachi performances calling it a [...] "good introduction to the singer, since it features his biggest hits <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> a flashy, impassioned performance". John Lannert of Billboard magazine called the album a [...] "predictable, albeit fan-pleasing, double CD live set" [...] and referred to his mariachi performances as [...] "classics done up mariachi style". Chito de la Torre wrote for La Prensa de San Antonio praised the album, stating that Miguel [...] "stands among the few that are genuinely good both on disc and live" [...] and complimented its [...] "energetic feel and live audience reactions". Rene Carbrera of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times said the album's productions [...] "essentially takes listeners through one of Miguel's dynamic performances" [...] and praised the bolero performances as [...] "superbly executed as pop ballads by Miguel." [...] Regarding the mariachi songs, Cabrera stated [...] "If there's anything that ...|$|E

500|$|To avoid {{collision}} {{with the oil}} tanker, Alex and Dante go into the ship's bilge and use the bow thrusters to turn it. The ship screeches {{down the side of}} the tanker, but manages to withstand the damage, and heads straight into a marina. It then crashes into a Saint Martin town and eventually stops. Alex jumps off to rescue Annie and hijacks a speed boat. Geiger takes Annie into a seaplane. [...] Alex shoots at it from the boat with a speargun and reels himself in through the water. He climbs onto the plane and rescues Annie, and both escape from the plane on one of its floats, which falls onto the ocean.

500|$|In the 2016 MLS Cup Final against Seattle, held at BMO Field on 10 December, Giovinco's {{performance}} was largely stifled by Seattle's heavy and aggressive defending, despite initially creating an early goalscoring chance for Altidore; throughout the match, he was fouled {{a total of}} six times and had several shots blocked. A scoring opportunity came in the 48th minute, but his shot was skewed wide of the near post. He was eventually substituted for Tosaint Ricketts in the 103rd minute, due to an apparent injury, and consequently, despite being the club's main penalty kick taker, was not used in the resulting shoot-out, which Toronto lost 5–4, following a 0–0 draw after extra-time. Regarding Giovinco's surprising substitution, Toronto's coach, Greg Vanney, stated in the post-match press conference: [...] "He couldn't move. He looked at me. It's not like I take him off because I want to. I look at him <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> me the sign that he can’t go any more and when he feels like he can’t go, he feels like he’s more of a liability to the group than anything. That’s the decision. It's not one that I generally want to make, but we had to." ...|$|E
500|$|Romeo begs Friar Lawrence, a sea otter, to wed them. After some thought, the friar {{believes}} {{their marriage}} {{will end the}} feud between their families, and agrees.

A fish finds them a lovely couple, but warns them {{that they will be}} in big trouble if the Prince finds out.
