40|$|We {{report on}} {{investigations}} aimed at detecting mutated RAS genes {{in a variety}} of preleukemic disorders and leukemias of myeloid origin. DNA transfection analyses (tumorigenicity assay) and hybridization to mutation-specific oligonucleotide probes established NRAS mutations in codon 12 or 61 of 4 / 9 <b>acute</b> <b>myelocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> (AML) and three AML lines. Leukemic cells of another AML patient showed HRAS gene activation.

30|$|Both SALL 4 and OCT 4 play {{important}} roles in embryonic development and oncogenesis. Human SALL 4 gene is the homolog of the Drosophila gene sal-like 4 [27],[28] and located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 20 at position 13.2 [28]. The functional role of SALL 4 has been suggested as the essential transcript factor in the maintenance of stem cell pluripotency and CSC proliferation [16]-[18]. In addition {{to play an important}} role in human embryonic development, mutation of SALL 4 gene has been related to several congenital and developmental abnormalities, such as DRRS (Duane-Radial Ray Syndrome) and acro-renal-ocular syndrome [29]. In animal studies, the constitutive expression of SALL 4 in transgenic mice has been linked to the development of acute myeloid leukemia and lymphocytic leukemia [30]. In human, the overexpression of SALL 4 has been reported in hematologic malignancies such as <b>acute</b> <b>myelocytic</b> and lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> [19]; and in solid tumors such as malignant rhabdoid tumor [20], germ cell tumor [21], liver and stomach [22], colorectal [23] and breast cancers [24]. Furthermore, SALL 4 has also been detected in Wilms tumor, but not in nephrogenic rests, this observation suggests that SALL 4 could be used as a protein marker in the distinction of these two entities [31]. Similarly, OCT 4 is also an important regulator of stem cell differentiation and plays an essential role in embryogenesis [25],[32]. OCT 4 expression has been reported in different types of cancers and involved in cancer progression [32].|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the ultrastructural characteristics of hybrid acute leukemia (HAL). Fifteen cases of HAL were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), focusing on organelles and myeloperoxidase (MPO) reaction of leukemic cells. By TEM, 5 out 15 cases of HAL were consistent with immunophenotyping (3 cases of biphe-notypic type, and 2 cases of biclonal type with granulocytes and lympho-cytes); 2 cases were suspected as HAL. On other hand, 5 cases of HAL were assigned to ALL, and 2 cases were misinterpreted as M 5 a and 1 as M 4 b. Most of the blast cells of biphenotypic HAL showed lymphoid features, except some cases containing MPO positive granules in blasts, while a few cases exhibited monocytic or nonspecific features. TEM offers advantages in the diagnosis of biclonal type HAL and biphenotypic HAL positive for MPO. However, it is difficult to differentiate MPO-negative cases of biphenotypic HAL from ALL and a few cases may be misinterpreted as M 5 by TEM. KEYWORDS diagnosis, hybrid acute leukemia, ultrastructure Hybrid acute leukemia (HAL) is a rare disease with dismal prognosis. It was called <b>acute</b> <b>myelocytic</b> and lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> (AMLL) collectively in the early literature, because the blasts maintained varied immunophenotypic profiles from multiple lineage antigens in individual patients. It is called biphenotypic type because individual neoplastic cells express both of myeloid and lymphoid antigens simultaneously, but biclonal type because there is both myeloid and lymphoid malignant cell population in a patient [1]. The cell components and structure of HAL are poorly documented by transmission electron microscope (TEM) because of the rarity and variety in the condition. The present paper documented the ultrastructural features of HAL in 15 cases diagnosed by flow cytometry...|$|R
