40|$|A MEMS Micro-Translation Stage (MTS) {{actuator}} {{concept has}} been developed {{that is capable of}} traveling long distances, while maintaining low power, low voltage, and accuracy as required by many applications, including optical coupling. The Micro-Translation Stage (MTS) uses capacitive electrostatic forces in a linear motor application, with stationary stators arranged linearly on both sides of a channel, and matching rotors on a moveable shuttle. This creates a force that allows the shuttle to be pulled along the channel. It is designed to carry 100 micron-sized elements on the top surface, and can travel {{back and forth in the}} channel, either in a stepping fashion allowing many interim stops, or it can maintain constant <b>adjustable</b> <b>speeds</b> for a controlled scanning motion. The MTS travel range is limited only by the size of the fabrication wafer. Analytical modeling and simulations were performed based on the fabrication process, to assure the stresses, friction and electrostatic forces were acceptable to allow successful operation of this device.

40|$|The {{production}} of 25 - 7 - 7 analysis grade of suspension fertilizer processed by Luxenâ€™s Method was investigated for some physical properties changes during various storage periods. The solid instead of liquid raw materials {{were used in}} the production. The experiment was designed in CRD consisting of six storage treatments; 0, 7, 15, 30, 90 and 180 days with 4 replicates. The total urea was provided for Urea 1 being fed in clear liquid mixed solution stage and Urea 2 being fed in suspended solution stage. The process was to add Urea 1, xanthan gum, KCl, MKP, and Urea 2, respectively, into the cylindrical glass bottle which was mounted to the <b>adjustable</b> <b>speeds</b> of mixer and presented water. The resulting 25 - 7 - 7 analysis grade of suspension fertilizers were stored undisturbed at normal room temperature for various storage periods and its physical properties were analyzed periodically.
