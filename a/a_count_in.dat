25|$|Not all {{gamma rays}} emitted by the source that {{pass through the}} {{detector}} will produce <b>a</b> <b>count</b> <b>in</b> the system. The probability that an emitted gamma ray will interact with the detector and produce a count is {{the efficiency of the}} detector. High-efficiency detectors produce spectra in less time than low-efficiency detectors. In general, larger detectors have higher efficiency than smaller detectors, although the shielding properties of the detector material are also important factors. Detector efficiency is measured by comparing a spectrum from a source of known activity to the count rates in each peak to the count rates expected from the known intensities of each gamma ray.|$|E
25|$|Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria, died in 937 and was {{succeeded by}} his son Eberhard. The new duke quickly came into {{conflict}} with Otto, as Eberhard opposed the king's sovereignty over Bavaria under the peace treaty between King Henry and Arnulf. Refusing to recognize Otto's supremacy, Eberhard rebelled against the king. In two campaigns {{in the spring and}} fall of 938, Otto defeated and exiled Eberhard from the kingdom and stripped him of his titles. In his place, Otto appointed Eberhard's uncle Berthold, <b>a</b> <b>count</b> <b>in</b> the March of Carinthia, as the new Duke of Bavaria on the condition that Berthold would recognize Otto as the sole authority to appoint bishops and to administer royal property within the duchy.|$|E

It was not to be, however, and after a slow first round, Bernardo turned the fight into a brawl in the second. The referee gave Aerts <b>a</b> <b>count</b> <b>in</b> round two, and in round three Bernardo knocked Aerts out with a right hook.

25|$|Rotrou’s {{position}} in the Duchy of Normandy was that of defender of the frontier with the Île-de-France. His position was probably enhanced by his participation in the First Crusade. Whereas his father had only held the title of viscount, Rotrou is usually called <b>a</b> <b>count.</b> <b>In</b> the war between Henry I of England and Robert Curthose, Rotrou sided with the former and was an important figure in Henry’s administration of the duchy after the capture of Robert at Tinchebrai in 1106. Rotrou was a direct vassal of Henry in England, where he held fiefs jure uxoris, in right of his wife, the king's daughter Matilda. He was not often in England, but is purported to have been close to his wife.|$|E

This mission was rendered moot when Napoleon overthrew the Bourbons during the Hundred Days and Ricard traveled to Ghent to join the king in exile. In 1817 Ricard was ennobled as <b>a</b> <b>count.</b> <b>In</b> the 1823 French invasion of Spain he served as a division commander in Jacques Lauriston's corps. He led the Royal Guard infantry division from 1829 to 1831, when he retired from the army. He died on 6 November 1843 at Recoules, Aveyron, France.

2500|$|When Walcott {{got back}} to Liston {{and looked at the}} {{knockdown}} timekeeper, Francis McDonough, to pick up the count, Liston had fallen back on the canvas. Walcott never did pick up the count. He said he could not hear McDonough, who did not have a microphone. Also, McDonough did not bang on the canvas or motion a number count with his fingers. McDonough, however, claimed Walcott was looking at the crowd and never at him. After Liston arose, Walcott wiped off his gloves. He then left the fighters to go over to McDonough. [...] "The timekeeper was waving both hands and saying, 'I counted him out—the fight is over,'" [...] Walcott said after the fight. [...] "Nat Fleischer [...] was sitting beside McDonough and he was waving his hands, too, saying it was over." [...] Walcott then rushed back to the fighters, who had resumed boxing, and stopped the fight—awarding Ali a first-round knockout victory. [...] Strict interpretation of the knockdown/count rule states it is the referee's count and not the timekeeper's that is the official count. [...] Furthermore, that count cannot be started until the fighter scoring the knockdown goes to and remains in a neutral corner. [...] Ali did neither.
