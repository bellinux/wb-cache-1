Results of broadband dielectric investigations of such materials in wide temperature (25 - 450 K) and frequency (20 Hz- 3 THz) ranges are presented. The dielectric permittivity strongly increases with graphite particle size. The graphite particle size and shape also have a strong impact on freezing temperature, conductivity activation energy and composite electromagnetic absorption properties at room temperature. The lowest percolation threshold is observed for exfoliated graphite (EG) -based composites. At low temperatures (below glass transition temperature of pure polymer matrix), the electrical conductivity in composites above the percolation threshold is mainly governed by electron tunnelling between graphite particles. At higher temperatures, electrical conductivity due to finite electrical conductivity of polymer matrix and by electron tunnelling from polymer matrix to graphite particles occurs in all composites. Microwave experiments show that EG is the only really effective additive, out of all investigated graphite particles, for producing electromagnetic interference shielding composite materials: 2 wt% of EG in epoxy is indeed not transparent for the electromagnetic radiation at 30 GHz...|$|R

40|$|This Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory {{sponsored}} project developed {{processes for}} converting coal feedstocks to carbon products, including coal-derived pitch, coke foams and fibers based on solvent extraction processes. A key {{technology is the}} use of hydrogenation accomplished at elevated temperatures and pressures to obtain a synthetic coal pitch. Hydrogenation, or partial direct liquefaction of coal, is used to modify the properties of raw coal such that a molten synthetic pitch can be obtained. The amount of hydrogen required to produce a synthetic pitch is about an order of magnitude less than the amount required to produce synthetic crude oil. Hence the conditions for synthetic pitch production consume very little hydrogen and can be accomplished at substantially lower pressure. In the molten state, hot filtration or centrifugation can be used to separate dissolved coal chemicals from mineral matter and insolubles (inertinite), resulting in the production of a purified hydrocarbon pitch. Alternatively, if hydrogenation is not used, aromatic hydrocarbon liquids appropriate for use as precursors to carbon products can obtained by dissolving coal in a solvent. As in the case for partial direct liquefaction pitches, undissolved coal is removed via hot filtration or centrifugation. Excess solvent is boiled off and recovered.
