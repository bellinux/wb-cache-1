I am a capitalist and a landholder. I have railway shares, mining shares, building shares, bank shares, and stock of most kinds; and a great trouble they are to me. But these shares do not represent wealth actually in existence; they are a mortgage on the labor of unborn generations of laborers, who must work to keep me and mine in idleness and luxury. If I sold them, would the mortgage be cancelled and the unborn generations released from its thrall? No. It would only pass {{into the hands of}} some other capitalist, and the working class would be no better off for my self-sacrifice. Sir Charles cannot obey the command of Christ; I defy him to do it. Let him give his land for a public park; only the richer classes will have leisure to enjoy it. Plant it at the very doors of the poor, so that they may at last breathe its air, and it will raise the value of the neighboring houses and drive the poor away. Let him endow a school for the poor, like Eton or Christ's Hospital, and the rich will take it for their own children as they do in the two instances I have named. Sir Charles does not want to minister to poverty, but to abolish it. No matter how much you give to the poor, everything except a bare subsistence wage will be taken from them again by force. All talk of practicing Christianity, or even bare justice, is at present mere waste of words. How can you justly reward the laborer when you cannot ascertain the value of what he makes, owing to the prevalent custom of stealing it? I know this by experience. I wanted to pay a just price for my wife's tomb, but I could not find out its value, and never shall.

30|$|The {{employed}} small neighborhood {{structure is}} highly restrictive, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>we</b> have used semi-active, instead of active schedules, {{is that in}} (Jain et al. 2000), through computational experiments, {{it has been shown}} that semi active schedules better match with restrictive neighborhood structures.

It should be noticed that when the employed neighborhood structure is not restrictive, active schedules perform better than semi-active schedules. The reason is twofold. First, makespan is a regular criterion and the optimum belongs to the set of active schedules. Second, active schedules are a subset of semi-active schedules, and, on average, are of higher quality than semi-active schedules.|$|E

Differential response by these cytoraces to RMHS and HDACi was observed.

30|$|Fire return {{interval}} sequences {{and fire}} season sequences {{can be set}} subjectively to correspond to the appropriate environment to which the data applies because they represent categorical data. We highlighted the utility of developing fire return interval and season sequences through the investigation of experimental design options for a retrospective study {{of the effects of}} contrasting fire regimes on biota of southwestern Australia. We see this type of data presentation as having wide application to land management authorities, as well as research personnel who are trying to identify patterns in their spatio-temporal data. The technique described in this paper is useful for investigating a snapshot of any form of spatio-temporal data. While we have used it for fire data, similar versions could be used for other forms of spatio-temporal data for which sequences of events are of interest. The technique could also be used to demonstrate changes to individual-based or point-based data. Examples of this may be bird or animal surveys or water quality data where counts or measures are classified and mapped in time sequences to demonstrate changes through time across the landscape. The main benefit of this technique, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>we</b> investigated it in our study, was to provide a broad overview of the temporal patterns in data, and how they were arranged across the landscape. The advantage of doing this in a GIS is that additional themes can be added such as vegetation types, geology, hydrology, or rainfall that may correlate with spatial differences between temporal patterns.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} hundred years, {{competing}} and incompatible positions in relation to basic problems of knowledge {{and the use of}} the verb ‘to know’ have multiplied; and the prospect of a consensus solution emerging with respect to any of the problems has not seemed particularly good. We have a Gordian knot. Even so, I suggest that we also have a way to cut it. This will involve identifying why the cognitive mechanism that produces our intuitions of knowing evolved and was maintained (by natural selection), i. e., identifying the ‘teleonomic function’ of that cognitive mechanism. Also, it will involve predicting, on the basis of this teleonomic function, the triggering-conditions of these natural knowledge intuitions. In this thesis, I develop a general theory of the origin, function and triggering-conditions of knowledge intuitions that will allow us to cut that knot. That theory follows basic biological theory (including that which pertains to natural altruism) and also signal detection theory. My theory identifies a number of different circumstances under which the triggering-conditions of knowledge intuitions are different. Strikingly, these different circumstances (and their associated triggering-conditions) map onto the different competing and incompatible epistemological positions to which I referred. This suggests that these positions are all correct within the boundaries of one of the circumstances that my theory identifies; and that the Gordian knot is largely the result of epistemologists claiming universal applicability of a theory that in fact only applies under particular circumstances. We cut the knot by specifying the different circumstances under which each of the different epistemological positions will hold, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>we</b> should expect it to hold in just these circumstances, in light of the teleonomic function of knowledge intuitions...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Arguments for logic-based {{knowledge}} representation often emphasize {{the primacy of}} entailment in reasoning, and traditional logic-based formulations of AI tasks were frequently in terms of entailment. More recently, practical progress in satisfiability-based methods has encouraged formulation of problems as model finding. Here, we argue for the formalization of search problems, which abound in AI {{as well as other}} areas, as a particular form of model finding called model expansion. An important conceptual part of this proposal is the formalization of the problem instance as a struc-ture, rather than as a formula. Adopting this view leads naturally to taking descriptive complexity theory as the starting point for developing a theory of languages for repre-senting search problems. We explain the formalization of search as model expansion, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>we</b> consider it an appropriate basis for such a theory. We emphasize the role of model expansion for first order logic, with extensions, in specifying NP search problems, <b>and</b> describe <b>the</b> formalization of arithmetic in this context.
