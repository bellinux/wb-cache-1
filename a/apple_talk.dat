40|$|The {{detailed}} {{pattern of}} residential daily activity {{is important to}} grasp {{in order to understand}} recent changes of various regions of advanced countries. The author and his colleagues have made several surveys concerning daily activities based on the time-geographic perspective. In these survey projects, a series of methods for the processing of activity data were developed. This paper introduces the database system developed to aid the analysis of daily activities using survey data, as well as the automate drawing system, PAPD (the Program for Activity Path Drawing) that charts these activity paths. The database system was built on the platform of the ACI corporation known as the 4 th Dimension. This system is capable of handling data on out - of - home activities of husbands and wives {{as well as on the}} characteristics of surveyed households. Three surveys were carried out in:. Shimosuwa, a small local town in Nagano Prefecture; Nissin, a suburban town near Nagoya; and Kawagoe, a suburban core city near Tokyo. In each case the activity diary method was utilized. With the relational structure of the database shown in Figure 3, the user can simultaneously retrieve both the activity data and the household individual data. Examples include Figure 4; 6 to 10. In addition, the database has the ability to chart activity paths. These are drawn by PAPD, as shown in Figure 5. The PAPD system, utilizing scripts of <b>Apple</b> Corporation's Hyper <b>Talk</b> on Hyper Card was developed in order to assist the analysis of daily activity paths, one of the essential concepts in time-geography. It draws a chart of activity paths for both husband and wife using the activity data transformed from the above database. In addition, PAPD has the function of inspecting the correspondence between husband's and wife's activities. The result of the inspection is displayed in Figure 15. This function provides useful support to find and correct errors which remain after the coding process...|$|R
5000|$|In 1956 - {{the year}} that the film was first shown on TV - MGM Records {{released}} their own authentic 40-minute LP soundtrack album from the film. This album featured not only most of the songs, but also enough dialogue for listeners {{to be able to}} follow the story, almost exactly as heard on the movie soundtrack. There were a few minor revisions in this 1956 edition, i.e. Aunt Em's two lines [...] "Dorothy, please, we're trying to count!" [...] (referring to their farm chickens) and [...] "Dorothy, Dorothy, we're busy!" [...] were turned into the single line [...] "Dorothy, Dorothy, we're busy! Please, we're trying to count!". The songs [...] "Optimistic Voices" [...] and [...] "The Merry Old Land of Oz", and the Tin Man's instrumental dance to [...] "If I Only Had a Heart", were omitted from the LP release; also gone were half of the orchestral main title music, half of the [...] "Munchkinland" [...] medley, the entire Professor Marvel sequence, the moments during the tornado scene during which Dorothy sees people - including Miss Gulch - flying past her window, the <b>talking</b> <b>apple</b> trees scene, the appearance of the witch {{on the roof of the}} Tin Man's cottage, the poppy field sequence, the moment when the Lion reads [...] "Surrender Dorothy" [...] in the sky, and the scene in the Haunted Forest in which the Tin Man is mysteriously lifted into the air. Also gone was the moment in which the Scarecrow says, [...] "They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there", and the Tin Man answers, [...] "Well, that's you all over", and the scene in which Dorothy's friends are scaling the cliff to get to the witch's castle, as well as many other tiny bits from the film. Perhaps most interesting was the total elimination of any reference to the Ruby Slippers, a very significant and pivotal part of the film.|$|R
6000|$|... "I declare I cannot {{recollect}} what I {{was talking}} of.--Oh! my mother's spectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! 'Oh!' said he, 'I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job {{of this kind}} excessively.'--Which you know shewed him to be so very.... Indeed I must say that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected, he very far exceeds any thing.... I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston, most warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parent could.... 'Oh!' said he, 'I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sort excessively.' I never shall forget his manner. And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some, 'Oh!' said he directly, 'there {{is nothing in the}} way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.' That, you know, was so very.... And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment. Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice--only we do not have them baked more than twice, and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times--but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it. The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwell--some of Mr. Knightley's most liberal supply. He sends us a sack every year; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees--I believe there is two of them. My mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days. But I was really quite shocked the other day--for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating these <b>apples,</b> and we <b>talked</b> about them and said how much she enjoyed them, and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock. 'I am sure you must be,' said he, 'and I will send you another supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever use. William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year. I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.' So I begged he would not--for really as to ours being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left--it was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he had been already; and Jane said the same. And when he was gone, she almost quarrelled with me--No, I should not say quarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left. Oh, said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could. However, the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing, as you may suppose. William Larkins is such an old acquaintance! I am always glad to see him. But, however, I found afterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of that sort his master had; he had brought them all--and now his master had not one left to bake or boil. William did not seem to mind it himself, he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for William, you know, thinks more of his master's profit than any thing; but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being all sent away. She could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bid her not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for Mrs. Hodges would be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks were sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told me, and I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for the world! He would be so very.... I wanted to keep it from Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it before I was aware." ...|$|R
