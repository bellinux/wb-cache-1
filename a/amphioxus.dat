5|$|In larval lampreys, {{the thyroid}} {{originates}} as an exocrine gland, secreting its hormones into the gut, and {{associated with the}} larva's filter-feeding apparatus. In the adult lamprey, the gland separates from the gut, and becomes endocrine, but this path of development may reflect the evolutionary origin of the thyroid. For instance, the closest living relatives of vertebrates, the tunicates and <b>Amphioxus,</b> have a structure {{very similar to that}} of larval lampreys (the endostyle), and this also secretes iodine-containing compounds (albeit not thyroxine).|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Schmidtke {{and colleagues}} showed that isozyme {{complexity}} {{is similar in}} <b>amphioxus</b> and tunicates, contradicting a prediction of Ohno's hypothesis that genome duplication occurred in the common ancestor of <b>amphioxus</b> and vertebrates. However, this analysis did not examine vertebrates, so could say nothing about later duplication events. (Furthermore, much later molecular phylogenetics has shown that vertebrates are {{more closely related to}} tunicates than to <b>amphioxus,</b> thus negating the logic of this analysis.) The 2R hypothesis saw a resurgence of interest in the 1990s for two reasons. First, gene mapping data in humans and mice revealed extensive paralogy regions - sets of genes on one chromosome related to sets of genes on another chromosome in the same species, indicative of duplication events in evolution. Paralogy regions were generally in sets of four. Second, cloning of Hox genes in <b>amphioxus</b> revealed presence of a single Hox gene cluster, in contrast to the four clusters in humans and mice. Data from additional gene families revealed a common one-to-many rule when <b>amphioxus</b> and vertebrate genes were compared. Taken together, these two lines of evidence suggest that two genome duplications occurred in the ancestry of vertebrates, after it had diverged from the cephalochordate evolutionary lineage.|$|E
25|$|Taxonomists place {{lampreys}} and hagfish in the subphylum Vertebrata of the phylum Chordata, {{which also}} includes the invertebrate subphyla Tunicata (sea-squirts) and the fish-like Cephalochordata (lancelets or <b>Amphioxus).</b> Recent molecular and morphological phylogenetic studies place lampreys and hagfish in the superclass Agnatha or Agnathostomata (both meaning without jaws). The other vertebrate superclass is Gnathostomata (jawed mouths) and includes the classes Chondrichthyes (sharks), Osteichthyes (bony fishes), Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia.|$|E
25|$|The thymus {{is present}} in all jawed vertebrates, where it {{undergoes}} the same shrinkage with age and plays the same immunological function as in human beings. Recently, a discrete thymus-like lympho-epithelial structure, termed the thymoid, was discovered in the gills of larval lampreys. Hagfish possess a protothymus associated with the pharyngeal velar muscles, {{which is responsible for}} a variety of immune responses. Little is known about the immune mechanisms of tunicates or of <b>Amphioxus.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Controversy {{about the}} 2R {{hypothesis}} hinged {{on the nature}} of paralogy regions. It is not disputed that human chromosomes bear sets of genes related to sets of genes on other chromosomes; the controversy centres on whether they were generated by large-scale duplications that doubled all the genes at the same time, or whether a series of individual gene duplications occurred followed by chromosomal rearrangement to shuffle sets of genes together. Hughes and colleagues found that phylogenetic trees built from different gene families within paralogy regions had different shapes, suggesting that the gene families had different evolutionary histories. This was suggested to be inconsistent with the 2R hypothesis. However, other researchers have argued that such 'topology tests' do not test 2R rigorously, because recombination could have occurred between the closely related chromosomes generated by polyploidy, because inappropriate genes had been compared and because different predictions are made if genome duplication occurred through hybridisation between species. In addition, several researchers were able to date duplications of gene families within paralogy regions consistently to the early evolution of vertebrates, after divergence from <b>amphioxus,</b> consistent with the 2R hypothesis. When complete genome sequences became available for vertebrates, Ciona intestinalis and <b>amphioxus,</b> it was found that much of the human genome was arranged in paralogy regions that could be traced to large-scale duplications, and that these duplications occurred after vertebrates had diverged from tunicates [...] and <b>amphioxus.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{the most}} {{primitive}} vertebrates, the hagfish and lampreys, the kidney is unusually simple: {{it consists of}} a row of nephrons, each emptying directly into the archinephric duct. Invertebrates may possess excretory organs that are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "kidneys", but, even in <b>Amphioxus,</b> these are never homologous with the kidneys of vertebrates, and are more accurately referred to by other names, such as nephridia. In amphibians, kidneys and the urinary bladder harbour specialized parasites, monogeneans of the family Polystomatidae.|$|E

60|$|Section 9. Comparing the two gastrulas, {{it is not}} {{difficult}} to see that if we imagine the ventral wall of the archenteron of <b>amphioxus</b> to have its cells enormously enlarged through the mixing of yolk with their protoplasm, we should have a gastrula essentially like that of the frog.|$|E

60|$|Perhaps {{the most}} startling {{proposition}} {{of all those}} which Professor Haeckel puts before us is that which he bases upon Kowalewsky's researches into the development of <b>Amphioxus</b> and of the Ascidioida, that {{the origin of the}} Vertebrata is to be sought in an Ascidioid form. Goodsir long ago insisted upon the resemblance between <b>Amphioxus</b> and the Ascidians; but the notion of a genetic connection between the two, and especially the identification of the notochord of the Vertebrate with the axis of the caudal appendage of the larva of the Ascidian, is a novelty which, at first, takes one's breath away. I must confess, however, that the more I have pondered over it, the more grounds appear in its favour, though I am not convinced that there is any real parallelism between the mode of development of the ganglion of the Ascidian and that of the Vertebrate cerebro-spinal axis.|$|E
60|$|Section 16. Invagination follows (Figure 6). In {{this process}} {{a portion of}} the blastosphere wall is the tucked into the rest, as {{indicated}} by the arrow, so that a two-layered sack is formed. The space ar. is the archenteron, the primordial intestine, and its mouth is called, the blastopore (bp.). The outer layer of this double-walled sac is called the epiblast. For the present we will give the inner lining no special term. The young <b>amphioxus</b> has, at this stage, which is called the gastrula stage, a curious parallelism with such a lowly form as the Hydra of our ditches. This latter creature, like the gastrula, consists essentially of two layers of cells, an outer protective and sensory layer, and an inner digestive one; it has a primordial intestine, or archenteron, and its mouth is sometimes regarded as being a blastopore. All animals that have little yolk, and start early in life for themselves, pass through a gastrula stage, substantially the same as this of <b>amphioxus.</b>|$|E
60|$|Animals for {{dissection}} may {{be obtained}} from the recognised dealers, who usually advertise in such scientific periodicals as Nature, Natural Science, and Knowledge. Sinel (naturalist, Jersey) is the most satisfactory dealer in dog-fish in our experience; Bolton (Malvern) will supply <b>Amphioxus</b> through the post; frogs and rabbits {{may be obtained}} anywhere. The tame variety of rabbit is quite satisfactory for the purpose of dissection.|$|E

The pharynx cut {{away from the}} dorsal body-wall, and with the true ventral body-wall {{turned over to the}} (animal's) right. The arrow a., a., passes through anus to intestine; b., b., is thrust through the atrial pore to the atrial cavity. Note coe., the body cavity.|$|E
60|$|Section 13. The {{phenomena}} of the extrusion of polar bodies and fertilization are treated of later, and will, therefore, {{not be considered}} now. We will start our description with an egg-cell, which has escaped, of course, {{since there are no}} genital ducts, by rupture of the parent, has been fertilized by the male element, and is about to develop into a young <b>amphioxus.</b> It is simply a single cell, with some power of amoeboid motion, a single nucleus and nucleolus; and in <b>amphioxus</b> its protoplasm is clear and transparent. Frequently ova are loaded with granules of food store (yolk), which enable the young animal to go far with its development before it is hatched and has to begin fending for itself. Such an ovum as that of our present type, however being devoid of such yolk (alecithal = without yolk), necessitates a very early start in life, and, for reasons too complicated to state fully here, the development in such a case is considered particularly instructive and primitive by zoologists.|$|E
60|$|Section 8. The {{next phase}} of {{development}} has an equally curious resemblance to and difference from what occurs {{in the case of}} the ova of animals which do not contain yolk. In such types (e.g., <b>amphioxus)</b> a part of the blastosphere wall is tucked into the rest, and a gastrula formed by this process of invagination. In the frog (Figure 5) there is a tucking-in, but the part that should lie within the gastrula, the yolk-containing cells, are far larger than the epiblast (ep.) which should, form the outer layer of cells. Hence the epiblast can only by continual growth accommodate what it must embrace, and the process of tucking-in is accompanied by one of growth of the epiblast, as shown by the unbarbed arrow, over the yolk. This stage is called the gastrula stage; ar. is the cavity of the gastrula, the archenteron; b.p. is its opening or blastopore. Such a gastrula, formed mainly by overgrowth of the epiblast, is called an epibolic gastrula, as distinguished from the invaginate gastrula of <b>amphioxus.</b> The difference is evidently entirely due to the presence of yolk, and the consequent modification of invagination in the former case.|$|E
6000|$|Then the {{candidate}} was badgered about the pterodactyl, and concerning {{the difference in}} anatomy between a bat and a bird, and about the lamprey, and the cartilaginous fishes, and the <b>amphioxus.</b> All these questions he answered more or less {{to the satisfaction of}} the examiners--generally less. When at last the little bell tinkled which was the sign for candidates to move on to other tables, the taller man leaned over a list {{in front of him and}} marked down upon it the following hieroglyphic:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Section 7. The {{method of}} {{examining}} cross-sections {{is an extremely}} convenient one {{in the study of}} such a type as <b>Amphioxus.</b> The student should very carefully go over and copy the six sections on Sheet 20, comparing Figure 1 as he goes. He should do this before reading what follows. One little matter must be borne in mind. These figures are merely intended to convey the great structural ideas, and they are considerably simplified; they must not be regarded as a substitute for the examination of microscopic sections. [He will notice a number of rounded masses from the body wall. The] -For instance, the body-wall- muscles of <b>Amphioxus</b> are arranged in bundles bent sharply in an arrow shape, the point forward. -A number of these bundles are cut in any one section, and so the even shading of our diagrams, if they professed to be anything more than diagrams, should be broken up into masses.- These -bundles, we may mention-, are called myomeres, and they are indicated in Figure 1 by lines pointing acutely forward. [Several are consequently cut in any transverse section (Sheet 20), and these are the rounded masses he sees.] Similar myomeres, similarly situated, are found in fish, behind the head, and, less obviously, they occur with diminishing importance as the scale of the vertebrata is ascended.|$|E
60|$|Professor Haeckel {{proposes to}} break up the {{vertebrate}} sub-kingdom, first, into the two provinces of Leptocardia and Pachycardia; <b>Amphioxus</b> being in the former, and all other vertebrates in the latter division. The Pachycardia are then divided into Monorhina, which contains the Cyclostome fishes, distinguished by their single nasal aperture; and Amphirhina, comprising the other Vertebrata, which have two nasal apertures. These are further subdivided into Anamnia (Pisces, Dipneusta, Amphibia) and Amniota (Reptilia, Aves, Mammalia). This classification undoubtedly expresses many of the most important facts in vertebrate structure in a clear and compendious way; whether it is the best that can he adopted remains to be seen.|$|E
