5|$|A third species, L. consors, was {{established}} by Marsh in 1894 for YPM 1882, which consists of most of one articulated skeleton and part {{of at least one}} other individual. The skull was only partially preserved, {{and the fact that the}} vertebrae were represented only by centra suggests <b>a</b> <b>partially</b> grown individual. Galton (1983) notes that much of the current mounted skeleton was restored in plaster, or had paint applied.|$|E

5|$|Eligible for salary arbitration, Nova and the Yankees {{agreed on}} a $3.3million salary for the 2014 season.

He had a 2–2 record and a 8.47 ERA in four starts before the surgery.|$|E
5|$|For unknown reasons, Ruisdael {{almost entirely}} stopped dating his work from 1653. Only five {{works from the}} 1660s have <b>a,</b> <b>partially</b> obscured, year next to his signature; none from the 1670s and 1680s have a date. Dating {{subsequent}} work has therefore been largely based on detective work and speculation.|$|E

On February 11, 2010, he was rushed to NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan after complaining of chest pains, and he had two coronary stents implanted in his heart.

5|$|Since <b>a</b> <b>partially</b> filled {{ballonet}} {{would cause}} longitudinal instability, {{due to the}} mass of air rolling fore or aft {{in the direction of}} pitch, two cloth partitions were used to divide the ballonet into three separate compartments; small holes in the partitions allowed the air to permeate gradually throughout the ballonet without affecting the stability of the airship.|$|E

Hedren passes her screen test and is groomed for the starring role in Hitchcock's latest film, The Birds; the director instructs her about her dress and appearance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In {{this paper}} we solve <b>a</b> finite-horizon <b>partially</b> {{observed}} risk-sensitive stochastic optimal control problem for discrete-time nonlinear systems and obtain small noise and small risk limits. The small noise limit is interpreted as <b>a</b> deterministic <b>partially</b> observed dynamic game, and {{new insights into}} the optimal solution of such game problems are obtained. Both the risk-sensitive stochastic control problem and the deterministic dynamic game problem are solved using information states, dynamic programming, and associated separated policies. A cer-tainty equivalence principle is also discussed. Our results have implications for the nonlinear robust stabilization problem. The small risk limit is <b>a</b> standard <b>partially</b> observed risk-neutral stochastic optimal control problem. 1...|$|R

5|$|Walton {{worked for}} many years on his only {{full-length}} opera, Troilus and Cressida, both before its premiere and afterwards. It has never been regarded as a success. The libretto is generally considered weak, and Walton's music, despite many passages that have won critical praise, is not dramatic enough to sustain interest. Grove calls the work <b>a</b> <b>partially</b> successful attempt to revivify the traditions of nineteenth-century Italian opera in a post-war era wary of heroic Romanticism.|$|E
5|$|A second {{specimen}} {{discovered at}} the same locality represents <b>a</b> <b>partially</b> articulated skeleton that is only lacking the tail. Likewise stored at the IVPP, the specimen has the collection number IVPP V13898. The specimen was described in a brief correspondence authored by Li, Olivier Rieppel, and Michael LaBarbera that was published by Science in September 2004; a more detailed description was subsequently published by Rieppel, Li, Nicholas Fraser in a 2008 Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology paper.|$|E
5|$|After the {{municipal}} merger between Oslo and Aker in 1948, Akersbanerne was merged into Oslo Sporveier, although Holmenkolbanen remained <b>a</b> <b>partially</b> owned subsidiary. In 1973, Oslo Sporveier bought the remaining shares, {{and two years}} later the operations were transferred to Oslo Sporveier, with Holmenkolbanen remaining a pure real estate company. The municipal take-over resulted in an upgrade to both the track and the rolling stock. New overhead wires and new and heavier track were laid. From 1978, the T1300 trains were taken into use. With the take-over, the lines were numbered, and the Sognsvann Line designated 81, although this was quickly changed to 13.|$|E
