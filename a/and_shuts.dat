As {{she begins to}} lose consciousness, Kowalski enters the capsule. Scolding her for giving up, he tells her to rig the Soyuz's soft landing jets to propel the capsule toward Tiangong. Stone then realizes that Kowalski's reappearance was a hallucination, but has nonetheless given her the strength of will to continue. She restores the flow of oxygen and uses the landing jets to navigate toward Tiangong on momentum.|$|E

40|$|Open <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> {{junctions}} {{are rare}} (V(D) J joining products in which site-specific recognition, cleavage and re-ligation of joining signals has been uncoupled from recombination. Here, we investigate {{the relationship of}} opening <b>and</b> <b>shutting</b> to recombination in two ways. First, we have tested a series of substrates containing one or two joining signals in an in vivo assay. Opening <b>and</b> <b>shutting</b> can be readily observed in substrates that have only one consensus joining signal. Thus, unlike recombination, the majority of open <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> events do not require interactions between two canonical joining signals. Next we examined two-signal substrates to investigate the effect of signal proximity on the frequency of dual open <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> events. These experiments indicate {{that at least some}} of the time opening <b>and</b> <b>shutting</b> can be a two-signal transaction. Together these results point to two mechanistically related, but distinct origins for open <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> joining events. In one case, cutting and closing may occur without interaction between two signals. In the other, we suggest that interaction of a canonical signal with 'cryptic' signal-like elements whose sequence is extensively diverged from canonical signals, may bias the V(D) J recombination machinery towards opening <b>and</b> <b>shutting</b> rather than recombination. Open <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> operations could in this way provide a means whereby mistakes in target recognition by the V(D) J recombination machinery produce a non-recombinant outcome, avoiding deleterious chromosomal rearrangements in lymphoid tissues...|$|R

25|$|In 1993, a {{different}} model called the opponent process model was proposed. This model explained {{that these two}} processes opposed each other to produce sleep, as against Borbely's model. According to this model, the SCN, which {{is involved in the}} circadian rhythm, enhances wakefulness and opposes the homeostatic rhythm. In opposition is the homeostatic rhythm, regulated via a complex multisynaptic pathway in the hypothalamus that acts like a switch <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> off the arousal system. Both effects together produce a see-saw like effect of sleep and wakefulness. More recently, it has been proposed that both models have some validity to them, while new theories hold that inhibition of NREM sleep by REM could also play a role. In any case, the two process mechanism adds flexibility to the simple circadian rhythm and could have evolved as an adaptive measure.|$|E

However, unbeknownst to the T-1000, the T-800 is able to bring itself back online using emergency power. The T-1000 nearly kills John and Sarah but the T-800 takes it by surprise and shoots it into a vat of molten steel with an M79 grenade launcher, destroying it. John tosses the arm and CPU of the original Terminator into the vat as well. As Sarah expresses relief that the ordeal is over, the Terminator explains that {{to ensure that it}} is not used for reverse engineering it must also be destroyed. It asks Sarah to assist in lowering it into the vat of molten steel, since it is unable to [...] "self-terminate", although John begs the Terminator to reconsider its decision.

2500|$|Contrary to its common name, {{the blind}} shark has [...] "perfectly adequate" [...] vision. It was so named by anglers because it retracts its eyeballs <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> its thick lower eyelids when {{removed from the}} water. This species can live for up to 18 hours out of water, {{allowing}} it to survive being stranded by the outgoing tide. The blind shark is secretive and sluggish during the day, with adults usually hiding in caves or under ledges and juveniles inside crevices, though it will take food given the opportunity. At night, it moves out over reefs and seagrass meadows to forage for small invertebrates (including crabs, shrimp, cephalopods, and sea anemones) and bony fishes. Prey items are captured via suction.|$|E

2500|$|The Bible {{presents}} Daniel and {{his companions}} as distinct, positive examples of individuals refusing {{to pay homage to}} another god, even at the price of their lives. During the time of the exile, Nebuchadnezzar erects a gold statue of himself and commands all subjects to worship it. [...] Three Jewish officials – Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego – who had been taken to Babylon as youths along with Daniel, refuse to bow to the statue. [...] As they face being burned alive in a furnace, they communicate their faith as well as their resolve: “If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and he will rescue us from your hand, O king. But even if he does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up." [...] In the later reign of Darius, Daniel’s refusal to give up private prayer to God and pray to the king instead results in him receiving a death sentence: being thrown into the lions’ den. [...] According to the Book of Daniel, an angel comes <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> the mouths of the lions so that Daniel is spared and rescued by the king himself the following morning.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{contemporary}} cognitive theorists postulate models {{featuring a}} central pool [...] "of mental resources {{that must be}} allocated to the various operations involved in processing, retaining, and reporting information". This means that working memory and the various {{areas of the brain}} responsible for it are theoretically limited to a finite set of [...] "mental resources" [...] or mental capacity with which to carry out operation. Cognitive inhibition, of course, is responsible for determining what is relevant to the working memory <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> out what is irrelevant, [...] "freeing up space" [...] and mental capacity needed for more pressing matters. In the theory of inefficient inhibition, cognitive inhibition does not perform its function fully, and a shortage of mental resources leads to decreased performance or inefficiency in tasks that require more mental capacity. While inefficient inhibition can result naturally in individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, this effect is especially pronounced in methamphetamine-dependent individuals. Clinically, these individuals can be highly distractible and exhibit difficulty focusing, which illustrates the fact that cognitive inhibition is being impaired and that inefficient inhibition is resulting. Because {{of the nature of the}} psychoactive drug, the brain is unable or reduced in its capacity to shut out irrelevant stimuli to the task at hand, and so tries to process and respond to any and all stimuli. This is most likely due to the effects of methamphetamine on inhibitory neurotransmitters like GABA, discussed in an earlier section.|$|E

David Oppenheim, who interviewed Wilson in 1966, remembers that [...] "we tried to talk with him but didn't get much out of him. Some guy said 'He's not verbal.' He was odd and he seemed odder." [...] In 2017, the Charlotte Observers Theodon Janes surmised that while Wilson's past struggles with mental illness are widely documented, he still [...] "is faring well enough to write a book ... and to headline [...] hugely ambitious concert tour, so presumably he’s capable of telling people who work for him that he's not up for interviews, if he isn't." [...] When asked about negative comments written in the book, Love responded: [...] "He’s not in charge of his life, like I am mine.

2500|$|The Gemara cited [...] to {{show that}} Abraham walked righteously and {{followed}} the commandments. Rabbi Simlai taught that God communicated to Moses a total of 613 commandments — 365 negative commandments, corresponding {{to the number of}} days in the solar year, and 248 positive commandments, corresponding to the number of the parts in the human body. The Gemara taught that David reduced the number of precepts to eleven, as [...] says, [...] "Lord, who shall sojourn in Your Tabernacle? Who shall dwell in Your holy mountain? — He who (1) walks uprightly, and (2) works righteousness, and (3) speaks truth in his heart; who (4) has no slander upon his tongue, (5) nor does evil to his fellow, (6) nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor, (7) in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but (8) he honors them who fear the Lord, (9) he swears to his own hurt and changes not, (10) he puts not out his money on interest, (11) nor takes a bribe against the innocent." [...] Isaiah reduced them to six principles, as [...] says, [...] "He who (1) walks righteously, and (2) speaks uprightly, (3) he who despises the gain of oppressions, (4) who shakes his hand from holding of bribes, (5) who stops his ear from hearing of blood, (6) <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> his eyes from looking upon evil; he shall dwell on high."

[...] Micah reduced the commandments to three principles, as [...] says, [...] "It has been told you, o man, what is good, and what the Lord requires of you: only (1) to do justly, and (2) to love mercy, and (3) to walk humbly before your God."
