Literature reporting how <b>acceleration</b> <b>pulses</b> can vary in cars impacted in different configurations is limited. The aim {{of this study was to}} collect and categorise different <b>acceleration</b> <b>pulses</b> in 3 different types of rear collision. The <b>acceleration</b> <b>pulse</b> resulting from a solid, 1000 kg, mobile barrier test at 40 % overlap and an impact velocity of 15 km/h was studied for 33 different cars. Seven cars were impacted at 100 % overlap at higher impact velocities using the same mobile barrier. <b>Acceleration</b> <b>pulses</b> from two different car types in real-world collisions producing a similar change of velocity were also analysed. The results from the barrier tests show that a similar change of velocity can be generated by a large variety of pulse shapes in low velocity rear impacts. The results from real-world collisions showed that a similar change of velocity was generated in different ways both in terms of peak and mean acceleration. The results of this study highlight the importance of knowing the <b>acceleration</b> <b>pulse</b> both when evaluating the severity of a real world crash and when designing test methods for evaluating vehicle safety performance in low velocity rear-end impacts, particularly in respect of soft tissue neck injuries...|$|R

Using the CHAOS- 2 model, we show that both this jerk and the previous 2003 jerk are caused by a single core field <b>acceleration</b> <b>pulse</b> reaching its maximum power near 2006. 0. This pulse seems to be simultaneously occurring in several regions of the core surface where it corresponds to dominant n = 5 and 6 spherical harmonic modes.

40|$|In this study, short latency {{vestibular}} evoked potentials (VsEPs) {{were recorded}} in five guinea pigs in response to alternating linear <b>acceleration</b> <b>pulses</b> with and without acoustic masking. A steel bolt was implanted in the skull and coupled to a shaker. Linear <b>acceleration</b> <b>pulses</b> (n = 400) in upward, downward or alternating directions were given, with a peak acceleration of 4 g after 0. 5 msec. Tests were repeated with acoustic masking, after modiolus destruction and after application of KCl in the vestibule. Stimuli of the vestibular nerve were recorded with a platinum electrode in the bony facial nerve canal in the bulla. Unilateral linear acceleration showed a shallow plateau at 0. 5 msec, which disappeared with alternating acceleration impulses and after modiolus destruction. Therefore all further tests were done with alternating impulses. After a latency time of 0. 8 msec a multiwave response was seen, with a first positive peak P 1 at 1. 16 ms. These were followed by other positive and negative peaks (N 1, P 2, N 2, P 3, N 3). With the elimination of cochlear influences by using acoustic masking, P 1 remained stable, while subsequent peaks were altered or eliminated. After modiolus destruction, the P 1 peak remained, although with a smaller amplitude due to vestibular damage. After application of a saturated KCl solution in the vestibule all responses, including P 1, disappeared, thus confirming the vestibular origin of these responses. We conclude that the onset latency of the VsEP and the peak latency and level of the first positive peak P 1 in response to alternating linear <b>acceleration</b> <b>pulses</b> without acoustic masking, measured in the facial canal, are good and stable parameters of vestibular function in guinea pigs...|$|R

Secular <b>acceleration</b> (SA) <b>pulses</b> in the Earth’s geomagnetic field during the last decade have been identified by Chulliat et al.

A three-dimensional finite element model of the rat skull and brain was used to understand the anatomical region-dependent stress response under mild TBI conditions. Anesthetized rats were exposed to varying coronal plane angular <b>acceleration</b> <b>pulses</b> without direct head contact. Experimental outcomes included unconscious time and histological evidence of brain pathology using GFAP and MAP 2. The finite element model was exercised using the five experimental and four supplemental pulses to simulate nine independent combinations of peak <b>acceleration</b> and <b>pulse</b> duration (290 to 542 krad/s 2 and 1 to 3 ms). Stress response metrics were correlated to histological and behavioral (e. g., loss of consciousness) evidence of injury in rats subjected to pure coronal plane angular acceleration of the head. Injury severity was modulated by independently controlling peak magnitude and duration of the angular acceleration. While peak Von Mises stresses correlated well with changes in injury severity associated with peak angular acceleration, this metric did not demonstrate sensitivity to changes in acceleration duration. However, an integrated stress-time metric was able to predict changes in injury severity associated with increasing angular acceleration magnitude and duration in both the hippocampal and parietal cortex anatomical regions. Results of this unique hybrid analysis indicate that the combined stress-time variable may be more suited to explain variation of mild TBI severity, rather than pure peak metrics...|$|R

40|$|Centrifuge {{models of}} soft clay {{deposits}} were shaken with suites of earthquake ground motions to study site response {{over a wide}} strain range. The models were constructed in an innovative hinged-plate container to effectively reproduce one dimensional ground response boundary conditions. Dense sensor arrays facilitate back-calculation of modulus reduction and damping values that show modest misfits from empirical models. Low amplitude base motions produced nearly elastic response in which ground motions were amplified through the soil column and the fundamental site period was approximately 1. 0 s. High intensity base motions produced shear strains higher than 10 %, mobilizing shear failure in clay at stresses larger than the undrained monotonic shear strength. I attribute these high mobilized stresses to rate effects, which {{should be considered in}} strength parameter selection for nonlinear analysis. The nonlinearity in spectral amplification is parameterized in a form used for site terms in ground motion prediction equations to provide empirical constraint unavailable from ground motion databases. The nonlinear site response is covered by total stress simulations of centrifuge models involving soft clay, and effective stress simulations of centrifuge models including liquefiable sand layers. Primary conclusions from the total stress analysis are (1) unreasonable shear strength values may arise from extrapolating modulus reduction curves to large strains, and properly modeling the shear strength by adjusting the high-strain region of the modulus reduction curve is essential for accurate nonlinear site response modeling, and (2) the shear strength must be adjusted for strain rate effects to capture the measured ground motions. The primary conclusion from the effective stress simulations is that ground motions following liquefaction triggering are significantly under-predicted using a modeling procedure in which the backbone stress-strain behavior is degraded as pore pressures develop in accordance with a pore pressure generation function. These models fail to capture the dilatancy behavior of liquefied sand that manifests as a transient stiffening in undrained loading, and enables propagation of high amplitude high frequency <b>acceleration</b> <b>pulses.</b> Constitutive models capturing the dilatancy behavior are demonstrated to have the capability to replicate these <b>acceleration</b> <b>pulses,</b> but the resulting ground motions are highly sensitive to input parameters...|$|R
