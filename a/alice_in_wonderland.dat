40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how dystopian {{elements in}} J. M. Barrie’s Peter Pan and Lewis Carroll’s <b>Alice’s</b> Adventures <b>in</b> <b>Wonderland</b> influence the morals that the stories convey. First, dystopian elements found <b>in</b> <b>Alice’s</b> Adventures <b>in</b> <b>Wonderland</b> will be examined, in which Carroll’s novel {{will be used}} as primary source. Subsequently, the next chapter will prove that several dystopian elements can be found in Peter Pan. The morals that can be found in Peter Pan and <b>Alice’s</b> Adventures <b>in</b> <b>Wonderland</b> will then be explored, together with the morality of some of the characters and whether dystopian elements influence the stories’ morals. Finally, it will be concluded that the dystopian elements indeed influence the morals found in Peter Pan and <b>Alice’s</b> Adventures <b>in</b> <b>Wonderland.</b> The paper’s findings will be summarised in the final chapter...|$|R
5|$|Snow White's success led to Disney {{moving ahead}} with more feature-film productions. Walt Disney used {{much of the}} profits from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to finance a new $4.5 million studio in Burbank– the {{location}} on which The Walt Disney Studios is located to this day. Within two years, the studio completed Pinocchio and Fantasia and had begun production on features such as Dumbo, Bambi, <b>Alice</b> <b>in</b> <b>Wonderland</b> and Peter Pan.|$|E

5|$|Sir John Tenniel drew {{a famous}} {{illustration}} of Alice meeting a caterpillar for Lewis Carroll's <b>Alice</b> <b>in</b> <b>Wonderland,</b> c. 1865. The caterpillar is {{seated on a}} toadstool and is smoking a hookah; the image {{can be read as}} showing either the forelegs of the larva, or as suggesting a face with protruding nose and chin. Eric Carle's children's book The Very Hungry Caterpillar portrays the larva as an extraordinarily hungry animal, while also teaching children how to count (to five) and the days of the week.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Crane {{illustrated}} and Evans printed, The Baby's Bouquet: a Fresh Bunch of Old Rhymes and Tunes, {{which went}} on to sell {{hundreds of thousands of}} copies.

In 1889, Flora's Feast: A Masque of Flowers was published, featuring flowers represented as human figures, for which Evans used as many as eight colour blocks. Their later collaborations includes an edition of <b>Alice</b> <b>in</b> <b>Wonderland</b> with coloured versions of John Tenniel's 1890 illustrations, and the 1899 A Floral Fantasy in an Old English Garden.|$|E

5|$|<b>Alice</b> <b>in</b> <b>Wonderland</b> is a 2010 American fantasy {{adventure}} film {{directed by}} Tim Burton from a screenplay written by Linda Woolverton. The film stars Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter, Crispin Glover, Matt Lucas, and Mia Wasikowska and features {{the voices of}} Alan Rickman, Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, and Timothy Spall. Based on Lewis Carroll's fantasy novels, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass.

She is the only one who can slay the Jabberwock, a dragon-like creature that is controlled by the Red Queen and terrorizes Underland's inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alice</b> <b>in</b> <b>Wonderland,</b> {{released}} in 1951, {{met with a}} lukewarm response {{at the box office}} and was a sharp critical disappointment in its initial release. Peter Pan, {{released in}} 1953, was, on the other hand, a commercial success and the highest-grossing film of the year. In 1955, Lady and the Tramp was released to higher box office success than any other Disney feature from the studio since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, earning an estimated $7.5 million in rentals at the North American box office in 1955. Lady is significant as Disney's first widescreen animated feature, produced in the CinemaScope process, and was the first Disney animated feature to be released by Disney's own distribution company, Buena Vista Distribution.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, Hanna–Barbera Productions {{was the most}} {{successful}} television animation studio in the business. The Hanna–Barbera studio produced over 3000animated half-hour television shows.
