5|$|Alternatively, prey animals {{might be}} {{sufficiently}} gregarious to form clusters tight enough {{to enhance the}} warning signal.

Gregariousness would assist predators to learn to avoid unpalatable, gregarious prey. Aposematism could also be favoured in dense populations even if these are not gregarious.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Sergey Kitaev [4] {{has shown}} that the {{exponential}} generating function for permutations <b>avoiding</b> <b>the</b> generalized pattern σ-k, where σ is a pattern without dashes and k is one greater than the largest element in σ, is determined by the exponential generating function for permutations avoiding σ. We show that the exponential generating function for permutations <b>avoiding</b> <b>the</b> partially ordered pattern k-σ-k also is determined by the exponential generating function for permutations avoiding σ. Avoidance of k-σ-k is equivalent to simultaneous avoidance of (k + 1) -σ-k and k-σ-(k + 1). Using this we construct a bijection between bicolored set partitions and permutations <b>avoiding</b> <b>the</b> pattern 3 - 12 - 3, and a bijection between Dowling lattices and permutations <b>avoiding</b> <b>the</b> pattern 3 - 121 - 3. 1...|$|R
