40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} mellitus is an autoimmune disorder characterized by destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic � cells by T lymphocytes. In nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, a role has been hypothesized for dietary gluten proteins in {{the onset of}} diabetes, and because gluten dependence is the major feature of celiac disease, together with production of Abs to the autoantigen tissue transglutaminase (tTG), we looked {{for the presence of}} anti-tTG Abs in the serum of NOD mice and, to establish their origin, analyzed the Ab repertoire of NOD mice using phage display Ab libraries. We found significant levels of serum anti-tTG Abs and were able to isolate single-chain Ab fragments to mouse tTG mainly from the Ab libraries made from intestinal lymphocytes {{and to a lesser extent}} from splenocytes. Data from NOD mice on a gluten-free diet suggest that the anti-tTG response is not glutendependent. The intestinal Ab response to tTG is a feature of NOD mice, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. The Journal of Immunology, 2005, 174 : 5830 – 5836. Nonobese diabetic (NOD) 3 mice develop spontaneous autoimmune disorders including insulin-dependent or type 1 {{diabetes mellitus}} (T 1 DM), Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and arthritis (1).

40|$|<b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> play a {{key role}} in {{adaptive}} immunity and are activated by interactions of their T cell receptors (TCR) with peptides (p) derived from antigenic proteins bound to MHC gene products. The repertoire of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> available in peripheral organs is tuned in the thymus. Immature <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (thymocytes) interact with diverse endogenous peptides bound to MHC in the thymus. TCR expressed on thymocytes must bind weakly to endogenous pMHC (positive selection) but must not bind too strongly to them (negative selection) to emerge from the thymus. Negatively selecting pMHC ligands bind TCR with a binding affinity that exceeds a sharply defined (digital) threshold. In contrast, there is no sharp threshold separating positively selecting ligands from those that bind too weakly to elicit a response. We describe results of computer simulations and experiments, which suggest that the contrast between the characters of the positive and negative selection thresholds originates in differences in the way in which Ras proteins are activated by ligands of varying potency. The molecular mechanism suggested by our studies generates hypotheses for how genetic aberrations may dampen the digital negative selection response, with concomitant escape of <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from the thymus...|$|R

The process has been termed "T cell vaccination. " In a recent study, T cell vaccination was done using T cells sensitized to rat alloantigens. The procedure produced a significant reduction of the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) against allogeneic cells. The reduction in MLR was not specific: Vaccination with T cells specific for stimulator cells of one allotype led to a reduced MLR stimulated by cells of another allotype. The present study was undertaken to examine whether T cell vaccination can induce tolerance to transplantation antigens in vivo. We used the model of heterotopic cardiac transplantation in rats. We now report that vaccinating rats with syngeneic, activated, alloantigen-primed <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> significantly prolonged survival of rat cardiac allografts. The effect of T cell vaccination was most evident when the T cells had been obtained from rats specifically sensitized against the donor rats: Brown-Norway (BN) allografts in control Wistar rats survived 8. 5 +/- 0. 4 d while BN allografts survived 29. 2 +/- 7. 1 d in Wistar rats that had been vaccinated with Wistar anti-BN cells.

Because SC have been recognized recently to have an immunogenic potential inducible to present protein autoantigens to <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> and considering their {{close proximity to the}} acetylcholine receptor (AChR) -bearing postsynaptic membranes, presentation of soluble and membrane vesicle-bound AChR to appropriate T cells was investigated.

40|$|An ideal {{treatment}} for autoimmune diseases {{would be a}} nontoxic means of specifically neutralizing the autoreactive lymphocytes responsible for the disease. This goal has been realized in experimental autoimmunity models by immunizing rats or mice against their own autoimmune cells such that the animals generate an immune response specifically repressive to the disease-producing lymphocytes. This maneuver, termed lymphocyte vaccination, was demonstrated to be effective using some, but not all, autoimmune helper T-lymphocyte lines. We now report that <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> otherwise incapable of triggering an immune response, can be transformed into effective immunogens by treating the cells in vitro with hydrostatic pressure. Clone A 2 b, as effector clone that recognized cartilage proteoglycan and caused adjuvant arthritis in Lewis rats, is such a cell. Untreated A 2 b could not trigger an immune response, but inoculating rats with pressure-treated A 2 b induced early remission of established adjuvant arthritis as well as resistance to subsequent disease. Specific resistance to arthritis was associated with anti-idiotypic T-cell reactivity to clone A 2 b and could be transferred from vaccinated rats to naive recipients using donor lymphoid cells. Aggregation of T-lymphocyte membrane components appeared to be important for an immune response because the effects of hydrostatic pressure could be reproduced by treatment of A 2 b with chemical cross-linkers or with agents disrupting the cytoskeleton. Populations of lymph node cells from antigen-primed rats, when treated with hydrostatic pressure, could also induce suppression of disease. Thus, effective vaccines can be developed without having to isolate the <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> as lines or clones. These results demonstrate that effector <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> suitably treated may serve as agents for specifically controlling the immune system...|$|R

40|$|We {{previously}} reported that NOD. c 3 c 4 mice develop spontaneous autoimmune biliary disease (ABD) with anti-mitochondrial Abs, histopathological lesions, and <b>autoimmune</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> similar to human primary biliary cholangitis. In this article, we demonstrate that ABD in NOD. c 3 c 4 and related NOD ABD strains {{is caused by}} a chromosome 1 region that includes a novel mutation in polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 (Pkhd 1). We show that a long terminal repeat element inserted into intron 35 exposes an alternative polyadenylation site, resulting in a truncated Pkhd 1 transcript. A novel NOD congenic mouse expressing aberrant Pkhd 1, but lacking the c 3 and c 4 chromosomal regions (NOD. Abd 3), reproduces the immunopathological features of NOD ABD. RNA sequencing of NOD. Abd 3 common bile duct early in disease demonstrates upregulation of genes involved in cholangiocyte injury/morphology and downregulation of immunoregulatory genes. Consistent with this, bone marrow chimera studies show that aberrant Pkhd 1 must be expressed in the target tissue (cholangiocytes) and the immune system (bone marrow). Mutations of Pkhd 1 produce biliary abnormalities in mice but have not been previously associated with autoimmunity. In this study, we eliminate clinical biliary disease by backcrossing this Pkhd 1 mutation onto the C 57 BL/ 6 genetic background; thus, the NOD genetic background (which promotes autoimmunity) is essential for disease. We propose that loss of functional Pkhd 1 on the NOD background produces early bile duct abnormalities, initiating a break in tolerance that leads to autoimmune cholangitis in NOD. Abd 3 congenic mice. This model is important for understanding loss of tolerance to cholangiocytes and is relevant to the pathogenesis of several human cholangiopathies...|$|R

We studied the <b>autoimmune</b> potential of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> immunologically ignorant of viral antigens acting as self antigens {{and whether the}} host defense molecule IFN-gamma could stimulate these cells to cytotoxic competency. For this purpose, we produced double transgenic mice expressing pancreatic IFN-gamma as well as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) nucleoprotein (NP) or glycoprotein (GP) antigen. 100 % of the NP+/IFN-gamma+ mice became diabetic before 2 mo of age, while none of the NP single transgenic littermates and only 10 % of IFN-gamma single transgenic littermates did. Strikingly, NP+/IFN-gamma+ mice spontaneously developed cytotoxic <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> activity on LCMV-infected targets and vaccinia virus-NP-infected ones without prior LCMV infection but NP+/IFN-gamma- mice did not, which indicates specific sensitization to the viral antigen by IFN-gamma.

Although H 3 - 10 A 1 infections stimulate normal CTL responses to CVB 3 -infected myocytes, the autoimmune response to myocardial antigens is absent. Treatment of H 3 - 10 A 1 -infected mice with 50 mg of cyclophosphamide per kg of body weight, a treatment which preferentially eliminates suppressor cells, allows both {{the development of the}} autoimmune cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response and the expression of myocarditis. Similar treatment of CVB 3 W-infected mice had no effect on the disease. The presence of the immunoregulatory cells was confirmed by adoptive transfer of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from either H 3 - 10 A 1 or CVB 3 W-infected donor mice into syngeneic CVB 3 W-infected recipients. Animals given H 3 - 10 A 1 -immune cells had minimal myocardial inflammation, while animals given CVB 3 W-immune lymphocytes developed enhanced cardiac disease. Elimination of the T-lymphocyte population from the donor cells prior to transfer abrogated suppression with the H 3 - 10 A 1 -immune population, showing that immunoregulation depended upon <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Both H 3 - 10 A 1 and CVB 3 W have cross-reactive epitopes between the adenine translocator protein and the virion which are indicative of antigenic mimicry and may be the basis for the autoimmunity to cardiac antigens.

In both situations, the recruitment mechanisms of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> into the tissues are essential for the immunological functions deciding the outcome. The recruitment of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> is largely dependent on their expression of various chemokine receptors. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify potential chemokine receptors involved in the recruitment of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> to normal human colonic mucosa and to CRC tissue, respectively, by examining the expression of 16 different chemokine receptors on <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> isolated from these tissues. Methods: Tissues were collected from patients undergoing bowel resection for CRC. Lymphocytes were isolated through enzymatic tissue degradation of CRC tissue and nearby located unaffected mucosa, respectively. The expression of a broad panel of chemokine receptors on the freshly isolated <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was examined by flow cytometry. Results: In the normal colonic mucosa, the frequencies of cells expressing CCR 2, CCR 4, CXCR 3, and CXCR 6 differed significantly between CD 4 + and CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> suggesting that the molecular mechanisms mediating <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> recruitment to the gut differ between CD 4 + and CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> In CRC, the frequencies of cells expressing CCR 2 and CXCR 5 were significantly lower in both the CD 4 + and CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> populations compared to unaffected colonic mucosa, and the frequency of CCR 9 + cytotoxic <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was significantly decreased in CRC tissue.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to explain the role of mangiferin as an immunostimulator on in vitro <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> culture of mammary tumor bearing mice. <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were isolated from the spleen of mice after two weeks of mammary tumor transplantation. The isolation was performed by using sterile nylon net and passed through nylon wool. Isolated <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were cultured in vitro on RPMI 1640 medium.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 –specific CD 4 + and CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> differ {{with regard to}} their homing {{kinetics}} to infected tissues. We studied the expression of cutaneous lymphocyte–associated antigen (CLA) and E-selectin ligand (ESL) by HSV- 2 –specific CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Virus-reactive <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were identified ex vivo byCD 154 or interferon-gup-regulation. We detected selective expression of CLA by HSV- 2 –reactive CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> but at levels lower than those we previously observed for CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Short-term HSV- 2 –reactive CD 4 + lines generated from periph-eral-blood mononuclear cells preferentially express CLA, compared with cytomegalovirus- or influenza-specific cells.

40|$|Severe {{malnutrition}} {{in children}} is frequently associated with infectious diseases. Animal {{models have been}} useful for studying the effects of malnutrition. One of the immunosuppressive mechanisms of malnutrition is inhibition of the activation of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> The voltage-dependent K(V) potassium channels are vital for the activation of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> The blockade of K(V) channels inhibits the activation of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Malnu-trition could affect the suitable synthesis of K(V) channels in <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> producing changes in the magnitude and/or dependency of the voltage of the K current. We reported {{a significant decrease in}} the K current and activation to a 20 mV more positive membrane potential in <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> of rats with severe malnutrition. These results indicate that the diminution in the K conductance by alteration of K(V) channels in severe malnutrition is one of the mechanisms that inhibit the activation of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Human <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> contain a diversity of ionic channel...|$|R

40|$|Tissue {{eosinophil}} infiltration, {{which is}} a hallmark of allergic and helminthic diseases, is mainly coordinated by <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> via the production of eosinophilotactic chemokines. Among <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> subsets, lymphocytes expressing gamma delta TCR have been determined as a key factor for eosinophil accumulation via direct and indirect mechanisms. This knowledge is strongly supported by the fact that, in different experimental models of eosinophilic airway inflammation and helminth-induced Th 2 lung inflammation, an evident tissue accumulation of gamma delta <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> is observed. In addition, the depletion of gamma delta <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> is correlated with the impairment of eosinophil accumulation in inflamed tissue. Gamma delta <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> are non-conventional <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> which comprise a minor <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> subset, mainly distributed in the tissue, and present crucial roles in innate and acquired immune responses. Gamma delta <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> recognize several danger- and pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules and stress antigens in a MHC-independent fashion and can provide rapid tissue-specific responses, via {{the production of a}} wide range of chemical mediators capable to modulate other cell populations. These mediators include chemoattractant cytokines and chemokines that attract eosinophils into the tissue by either direct recognition (such as IL- 5, CCL 11 /eotaxin), or indirect mechanisms via the modulation of alpha beta <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> and macrophages (through the production of interferon-γ, IL- 4 and CCL 2 /MCP- 1, for example).
