40|$|Aims: It {{is argued}} that one’s sense of self is {{threatened}} and eroded by mental illness. According to the narrative perspective, one’s personal life narrative is displaced and maintained by a story of illness. However, dialogical self theorists argue that mental illness limits the number of ‘I’ positions available within an individual, resulting in the positions/voices becoming rigid and being dominated by a singular, monological position. The aims of this qualitative study are to attempt to understand and examine psychiatric inpatients’ personal lived experiences of an <b>art</b> <b>group.</b> The goal {{of the study is}} to focus on the impact of the art-making process on these patients with regards to the construction of their sense of self. Design: A qualitative research design was used in the study. Method: Four psychiatric in-patient <b>art</b> <b>group</b> members – three male and one female, between the ages of 27 and 40 – were interviewed. A semi-structured interview schedule consisting of sixteen questions focusing on the interviewees’ experiences of the <b>art</b> <b>group</b> was used. The interviews were analysed using an interpretive phenomenological analysis. Results: Three superordinate themes emerged: What the Participants Gained From the <b>Art</b> <b>Group,</b> Sense of Community and Leaving a Mark, and The Experience of Self in the <b>Art</b> <b>group.</b> All three Superordinate themes fall within the participants’ experience of the <b>art</b> <b>group.</b> Conclusion: All four of the participants expressed positive feelings and enjoyment towards the <b>art</b> <b>group.</b> Participation in the <b>art</b> <b>group</b> provided the participants with a sense of pride, achievement and hope within their lives. As a result of participation on the <b>art</b> <b>group,</b> one of the four participants was able to construct a thin alternative experience and sense of self...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: Adolescence {{is a time}} {{of great}} physiological, {{psychological}} and social change. This paper will be highlighting how participation in an <b>art</b> <b>group</b> can benefit adolescent psychosocial development. In order to address this, adolescents need to be considered on a psychological, social and political level. Since the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession, adolescents have faced limited training and employment opportunities (Prince’s Trust, 2014). Alongside this, the UK has great social inequalities, which although the government aims to tackle, are still evident (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009). Furthermore, adolescents face going through their own personal transitions into adulthood which holds its own complexities. <b>Art</b> <b>groups</b> have proven benefits, many of which can be applicable to adolescents (Twiss and Cooper, 2000). Aims: Identify and understand the major psychological change adolescent’s experience. Also, use literature and theory to establish the main issues faced by adolescents in today’s society. Furthermore, establish the benefits of <b>art</b> <b>groups</b> for adolescents by examining {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} <b>art</b> <b>groups</b> in the literature. Conclusion: Adolescents have suffered from the impact of the economic downfall and struggle to find jobs, apprenticeships and training opportunities (The Prince’s Trust, 2014). This causes individuals to be at risk of the “vicious circle” of social exclusion which involves a multitude of issues including; social isolation, poverty and mental health problems (Marmot, 2010). Some <b>art</b> <b>groups</b> have been set up to help tackle these issues. However, there is limited number of published literature on community <b>art</b> <b>groups</b> for adolescents.
