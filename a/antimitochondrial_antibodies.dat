50|$|E3 binding protein {{also known}} as {{pyruvate}} dehydrogenase protein X component, mitochondrial is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PDHX gene. The E3 binding protein is {{a component of the}} pyruvate dehydrogenase complex found only in eukaryotes.Defects in this gene are a cause of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency which results in neurological dysfunction and lactic acidosis in infancy and early childhood. This protein is also a minor antigen for <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibodies.</b> These autoantibodies are present in nearly 95% of patients with the autoimmune liver disease primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). In PBC, activated T lymphocytes attack and destroy epithelial cells in the bile duct where this protein is abnormally distributed and overexpressed. PBC eventually leads to cirrhosis and liver failure.|$|E
40|$|Seventy seven sera with <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibody</b> exhibiting the M 2 -M 4 {{pattern in}} {{immunofluorescence}} (56 from primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), 21 from non-primary biliary cirrhosis patients) were studied by the combined use of Western immunoblotting with beef heart mitochondria and an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with beef heart submitochondrial particles. Forty seven sera (10 without autoantibodies and 37 with different auto-antibodies) were included as controls. By immunoblotting, seven mitochondrial peptides reacting with <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibody</b> positive sera were detected. These were of molecular weight 74 kD, 58 kD, 55 kD, 52 kD, 51 kD, 46 kD, and 43 kD. All primary biliary cirrhosis sera and 71 % of antimitochondrial antibody-positive non-primary biliary cirrhosis sera reacted {{with one or}} more of these peptides, while none of the 47 <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibody</b> negative sera reacted in immunoblotting. The 74 kD band was the most frequently detected (84 % of primary biliary cirrhosis and 57 % of non-primary biliary cirrhosis cases). All the primary biliary cirrhosis sera which failed to react with this peptide, showed a positive reaction with that of molecular weight 52 kD. 67 / 77 (87 %) immunofluorescence <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibody</b> positive sera reacted in the ELISA test (93 % of primary biliary cirrhosis and 71 % of non-primary biliary cirrhosis cases). All the 47 immunofluorescence <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibody</b> negative sera were confirmed negative by ELISA. The ELISA values correlated with the immunofluorescence titres (p less than 0. 05). By comparison of the results obtained by these two techniques, it emerged that the ELISA test (using our preparation of submitochondrial particles) was not able to detect the antibody directed against the mitochondrial peptide of 52 kD, which thus seems to be different from the other specificities...|$|R
40|$|A {{retrospective}} analysis of clinical and laboratory features of 102 patients, whose sera contained antibody to mitochondria, showed that primary biliary cirrhosis was diagnosed in 50 % of them.

50|$|While this {{deficiency}} primarily {{results in}} mutations in the E1 alpha subunit of the PDH complex, a few mutations {{have been identified}} in the PDX1 gene. Specific investigations of this gene have identified 78del85 and 965del59 mutations in a homozygous state, while some mutations could not be identified due to no PDHX mRNA being expressed in the individuals. In other cases, {{it has been reported that}} an entire exon, exon 10, was removed due to a gross deletion mutation; the mechanism for this has been theorized to be a mispairing, because there is an exact direct repeat, CCACTG, within the gene. Other large deletions (over 3900 bp) have been reported. E3BP, in coordination with the E2 subunit, has also been shown to be a secondary antigen for <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibodies</b> and immune responses.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} a group of 20 {{patients}} with an initial diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) whose serum tested negative for <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibodies</b> by immunofluorescence. All had a clinical history compatible with primary biliary cirrhosis, and results of biochemical, histological, and radiological investigations were consistent with this diagnosis despite the absence of <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibodies</b> by immunofluorescence. For comparison, these patients were matched for sex and serum bilirubin with 20 antimitochondrial antibody positive (> 1 : 160) and histologically confirmed primary biliary cirrhosis patients who served as controls. Serum samples from both groups were retested blindly for <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibodies</b> using immunoblotting and for antibodies to the major M 2 mitochondrial autoantigens by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Three antimitochondrial antibody immunofluorescence negative patients had <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibodies</b> by immunoblotting and ELISA; the remaining 17 patients were confirmed negative by all methods. The antimitochondrial antibody immunofluorescence positive controls were verified by immunoblotting or ELISA, or both. All 17 patients negative for <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibodies</b> had antinuclear antibodies, often in high titres, compared with 3 / 17 of the antimitochondrial antibody positive controls (p = 0. 0001). Additionally, the antimitochondrial antibody negative group also had significantly higher smooth muscle antibody titres (p = 0. 03) and lower serum IgM (p = 0. 01) and aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0. 03) activities than the antimitochondrial antibody positive controls. Analysis of clinical findings, histological tests, serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and IgG, disclosed {{no significant differences between the}} two groups. This paper describes a group of patients with the clinical and histological features of PBC but who do not fulfil the usual criteria necessary to make this diagnosis. Because they also have very high titres of antinuclear antibodies, smooth muscle antibodies, and comparatively low IgM and aspartate aminotransferase activities, we believe they are distinct from PBC and have a syndrome of autoimmune cholangitis...|$|E
40|$|Two {{immunofluorescence}} {{procedures to}} evaluate antinuclear antibodies were compared {{in a series}} of 221 patients with chronic liver disorders of various aetiologies. The use of HEp- 2 cells allowed us to discriminate with more confidence between the homogeneous and speckled patterns, to show the presence of associated patterns in the same serum, and, above all, to identify two specificities, unrecognizable on tissue sections. The anticentromere antibody was found in 10 % of cases of primary biliary cirrhosis and occasionally in other conditions; the antibody staining multiple nuclear dots was strictly confined to primary biliary cirrhosis (17 %). With the exception of autoimmune chronic active hepatitis the prevalence of antinuclear antibodies increased in all groups, particularly in primary biliary cirrhosis. Homogeneous antinuclear antibody was associated by both immunofluorescence procedures with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis. The multiple nuclear dot antinuclear antibody {{turned out to be an}} additional marker of primary biliary cirrhosis, helpful for the positive diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis in a proportion of cases negative for <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibody.</b> Absorption experiments showed that multiple nuclear dot and <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibody</b> are antigenically distinct.

40|$|Seventy four liver biopsies from 59 {{patients}} were reviewed by two observers and histologically graded {{in the absence}} of clinical information, firstly, to assess the level of agreement with previous diagnoses; secondly, to identify differences between primary biliary cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis; and, thirdly, to assess the specificity of Shikata orcein staining and <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibody</b> positivity and titre for primary biliary cirrhosis. Thirty six patients with adequate histology were initially selected as typical of primary biliary cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis; agreement both between observers and with original diagnoses was reached in 26 (72 %) (15 with primary biliary cirrhosis (group 1), 11 with chronic active hepatitis (group 2)). In 19 diagnostically difficult patients in whom clinical and original histological findings had been at variance, histological agreement between observers was reached in 17 (group 3) and original underdiagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis was suggested. The main clinical and histological differences between groups 1 and 2 are discussed in this paper. Although a high grade of positivity for copper associated protein in the Shikata orcein stain was seen only in primary biliary cirrhosis, a high titre of <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibody</b> positivity was not unique to this condition...|$|R

40|$|A loss of {{epidermal}} cohesion in pemphigus vulgaris (PV) {{results from}} autoantibody action on keratinocytes (KCs) activating the signaling kinases and executioner caspases that damage KCs, causing their shrinkage, detachment from neighboring cells, and rounding up (apoptolysis). In this study, {{we found that}} PV antibody binding leads to activation of epidermal growth factor receptor kinase, Src, p 38 MAPK, and JNK in KCs with time pattern variations from patient to patient. Both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways were also activated. Although Fas ligand neutralizing antibody could inhibit the former pathway, the mechanism of activation of the latter remained unknown. PV antibodies increased cytochrome c release, suggesting damage to mitochondria. The immunoblotting experiments revealed penetration of PVIgG into the subcellular mitochondrial fraction. The <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibodies</b> from different PV patients recognized distinct combinations of antigens with apparent molecular sizes of 25, 30, 35, 57, 60, and 100 kDa. <b>Antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibodies</b> were pathogenic because their absorption abolished the ability of PVIgG to cause keratinocyte detachment both in vitro and in vivo. The downstream signaling of <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibodies</b> involved JNK and late p 38 MAPK activation, whereas the signaling of anti-desmoglein 3 (Dsg 3) antibody involved JNK and biphasic p 38 MAPK activation. Using KCs grown from Dsg 3 −/− mice, we determined that Dsg 3 did not serve as a surrogate antigen allowing <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibodies</b> to enter KCs. The PVIgG-induced activation of epidermal growth factor receptor and Src was affected neither in Dsg 3 −/− KCs nor due to absorption of <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibodies.</b> These results demonstrated that apoptolysis in PV is a complex process initiated by at least three classes of autoantibodies directed against desmosomal, mitochondrial, and other keratinocyte self-antigens. These autoantibodies synergize with the proapoptotic serum and tissue factors to trigger both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of cell death and break the epidermal cohesion, leading to blisters. Further elucidation of the primary signaling events downstream of PV autoantigens will be crucial {{for the development of}} a more successful therapy for PV patients...|$|E

The specificity of <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibodies</b> for primary biliary cirrhosis as detected by immunoblotting was investigated. Commercially available preparations of pyruvate and oxo-glutarate dehydrogenases and beef-heart mitochondria were used as source of antigens. Sera from 47 primary biliary cirrhosis patients (46 of whom were antimitochondrial antibody positive by immunofluorescence), 16 non-primary biliary cirrhosis patients (antimitochondrial antibody positive by immunofluorescence), 23 liver-kidney microsomal antibody positive chronic active hepatitis patients, and 32 patients with connective tissue diseases were examined. Of the 47 subjects with primary biliary cirrhosis, 43 (91 %) and 13 (28 %) tested positive by immunoblotting for pyruvate and oxo-glutarate dehydrogenase, respectively. Only three primary biliary cirrhosis patients were negative for both antigens, including the only one shown to be antimitochondrial antibody negative by immunofluorescence. The other two patients were positive by immunoblotting with beef-heart mitochondria. In contrast, only three of 16 (19 %) non-primary biliary cirrhosis patients who were antimitochondrial antibody positive by immunofluorescence tested positive by immunoblotting (for both pyruvate dehydrogenase and beef-heart mitochondria). None of the 23 liver-kidney microsomal antibody positive and the 32 patients with rheumatic diseases were positive by immunoblotting with any antigen.

40|$|Abstract Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), {{formerly}} called primary biliary cirrhosis, is {{a chronic}} cholestatic disease {{characterized by an}} autoimmune-mediated destruction of small and medium-sized intrahepatic bile ducts.

However, the development of a reproducible indirect immunofluorescence assay for <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibody</b> made it possible to diagnose the disease at an earlier stage, and introduction of ursodeoxycholic acid therapy as the first-line therapy for PBC drastically changed PBC-related mortality.

40|$|Background: Primary biliary {{cirrhosis}} (PBC) is {{a chronic}} cholestatic disease, which can progress to hepatic failure. Aim: To study the clinical presentation, pathological features, treatment and {{outcome of a}} group of patients with PBC. Material and methods: Retrospective review of medical records of 115 patients (110 females, age range 30 - 76 years) with PBC. Clinical presentation, pathological stage, treatment, outcome and eventual use of liver transplantation, were recorded. Result: Seventy eight percent of patients were symptomatic at presentation (itching in 69 % and malaise in 62 %). <b>Antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibodies</b> were positive in 56 %. No clinical or laboratory differences were observed between symptomatic patients or those with positive <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{and the rest of the}} study group. Sjögren syndrome was present in 38 %, hypothyroidism in 13 %, scleroderma in 7 % and rheumatoid arthritis in 5 %.

40|$|AIM: To {{present the}} characteristics, {{management}} and outcome {{of patients with}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections concurrent with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). METHODS: Since January 2001 to September 2009, we retrospectively evaluated the medical records of all HBV (n = 1493) and HCV patients (n = 526) who are followed in our center {{for the presence of}} concurrent PBC. Seventeen patients identified with concurrent viral hepatitis and PBC (8 HCV and PBC; follow-up: 61 ± 37 mo and 9 HBV and PBC; follow-up: 57 ± 38 mo).

RESULTS: HCV or HBV diagnosis preceded that of PBC in most patients by many years. PBC diagnosis was based on the presence of <b>antimitochondrial</b> <b>antibody</b> and elevated cholestatic enzymes in all 17 patients, while one third (5 / 17; 29. 4 %) experienced severe pruritus many years before diagnosis. Patients with PBC and HBV were significantly younger at diagnosis of PBC compared to patients with PBC and HCV (56. 1 ± 11. 2 vs 68. 5 ± 10. 3, respectively, P < 0. 05). At initial clinical and histological assessment the majority of patients were cirrhotics (10 / 17; 58. 8 %) with the group of PBC and HCV carrying the highest frequency (87. 5 % vs 33. 3 % in PBC and HBV; P < 0. 05). The patients with HBV and concomitant PBC seem to have better outcome compared to those with HCV and PBC since none of the 6 non-cirrhotics with HBV and PBC developed cirrhosis during follow-up. CONCLUSION: PBC diagnosis in HBV or HCV patients is very difficult and usually delayed. Therefore, in any case, cholestasis should alert physicians to further search for PBC. © 2013 Baishideng...|$|R
