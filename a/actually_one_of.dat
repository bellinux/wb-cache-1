Vansina, however, notes that precolonial societies had high birth and death rates, leading to a great deal of natural population fluctuation over time. Among the Kuba, the period 1880 to 1900 was <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> population expansion.|$|E
5|$|Madonna faced {{a lawsuit}} in 2004 over an image in the book. Titled Amarak Productions, Inc. vs. Morton, Madonna's former {{bodyguard}} and ex-lover Jim Albright brought a defamation case against Morton, based on an incorrect photo caption. The photo had a caption identifying the subject in it as Albright; it was <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Madonna's homosexual back-up dancers, Jose Gutierez. Amarak Productions, Inc. had employed Albright as Madonna's bodyguard in 1992, and he became romantically involved with her. While writing Madonna, Morton contacted Albright to gather information on their relationship. On discovering the misleading image, the lawsuit was filed by Albright who objected to the caption.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} largest glacier was the Sherwin or Pre-Tahoe glacier, which eroded the upper Merced {{watershed}} {{to an extent}} close to its present form. Three stages followed during the Wisconsinian glaciation; these were the Tahoe, Tenaya and Tioga stages, of which the Tioga was the smallest. The Tioga glacier left {{at the mouth of}} Yosemite Valley a rocky moraine. This moraine was <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> several moraines deposited by the four glaciations, which include Medial Moraine and Bridalveil Moraine. After the Tioga Glacier retreated this moraine formed a lake that flooded nearly the entire valley. Gradual sedimentation filled Lake Yosemite, creating a broad and flat valley floor. Sediments of glacial origin continued to travel down the Merced River following then, helping to form the flat floor of the Central Valley.|$|E

5|$|In the present, Kratos overcomes several {{obstacles}} {{in his quest}} to find the Ambrosia, including defeating a giant spider, ignoring Athena's pleas to stop his quest, and overcoming the reanimated corpses of Captain Nikos and his men—a final attempt by Hades to stop the Spartan. On returning to the island, Kratos discovers that the island is <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Chaos Giants, the fifty-headed and one hundred armed Gyges. An outraged Gyges explains that Kratos had thwarted the Giant's plan to use the elixir to resurrect his brothers Briareus and Cottus, and then reclaim the world. In his fiery battle with Cereyon, Kratos inadvertently burned off Gyges' one hundred arms, and then stole the Ambrosia. Without arms and now unable to reach the Ambrosia, Gyges was forced to wait for Kratos' return. During the battle, Kratos reveals that he seeks to destroy the elixir to prevent the worshipers of the slain god Ares from resurrecting their master. Kratos then uses the Fire of Apollo to destroy both the Tree of Life and Gyges.|$|E
5|$|With {{help from}} the {{treasure}} hunter Jon, Musashi finds the Earth Scroll and defeats its crest guardian. After its defeat, half-vampire and half-zombie creatures known as Vambees appear in the nearby village. While searching {{for a way to}} stop the Vambees, Musashi finds the Water Scroll and defeats its crest guardian in the basement where the Vambees originate. While Musashi searches for the Fire Scroll, Musashi's rival, Kojiro, kidnaps Princess Fillet and uses her as a hostage to force a battle with Musashi. Kojiro is defeated and Fillet is then rescued. Musashi then searches for thieves from the Thirstquencher Empire and makes his way to the next crest guardian. It is then revealed that Princess Fillet is <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Thirstquencher's thieves disguised and that the real Fillet is still in their hands. Musashi then continues his journey, finds the Wind Scroll, and defeats its crest guardian in an ants' nest.|$|E

25|$|The large basins of the Michelangelo {{quadrangle}} {{have been}} dated relatively by counting the cumulative density of superposed primary impact craters that have diameters greater than 20 km. This technique {{has proven to}} be of great value in dating lunar basins (Wilhelms, in press), where obvious superposition relations do not exist. Results of these crater counts indicate that Dostoevskij, presumed to be of c3 age (McCauley and others, 1981), is <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the oldest basins in the map area (early c1). Thus, strict morphological determination of stratigraphic age may be significantly in error.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{important}} evolution of coin shape (round to square) and material (from gold to silver to brass) across the territories and the periods, and from Greek type to Indian type {{over a period of}} nearly 3 centuries.

Coinage evolution is {{an important}} point of Indo-Greek history, and <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most important since most of these kings are only known by their coins, and their chronology is mainly established by the evolution of the coin types.|$|E

With the threat of US intervention looming unless the government controls the situation, the team uses an old stretch of the Ginza Line to approach an artificial island Tsuge uses as his hideout. Goto also takes care of things on his end by facilitating the arrest of Shigeki Arakawa, a GSDF intelligence agent who is <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Tsuge's cohorts. After a fierce fight inside the artificial island's tunnel which results in flooding, the team evacuates the tunnel while Nagumo breaks through to finally arrest Tsuge.|$|E
25|$|The Young Henry's affairs took a {{turn for}} the worse in 1182. He fell out with William Marshal, the leader of his tournament mesnée. The unknown author of L'Histoire de Guillaume le Maréchal {{suggests}} that Marshal's disgrace was because he had indulged in a clandestine affair with Queen Margaret. David Crouch, one of the Marshal's principal modern biographers, argues that the charge against William was <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> lèse majesté, brought on by Marshal's own arrogance and greed. By this account, the charge of adultery was only introduced in the Life of William Marshal as a distraction from the real charges, of which he was most probably guilty. Though the Young King sent his wife early in 1183 to the French court, it was done most likely to keep her safe in the impending war with his brother, Richard, rather than because she was in disgrace.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} {{variation in}} ant–aphid relationships involves lycaenid butterflies and Myrmica ants. For example, Niphanda fusca butterflies lay eggs on plants where ants tend herds of aphids. The eggs hatch as caterpillars which {{feed on the}} aphids. The ants do not defend the aphids from the caterpillars (this {{is due to the}} caterpillar producing a pheromone the ants detect making them think the caterpillar is <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them), but carry the caterpillars to their nest. In the nest, the ants feed the caterpillars, who in return produce honeydew for the ants. When the caterpillars reach full size, they crawl to the colony entrance and form cocoons. After two weeks, butterflies emerge and take flight. At this point, the ants will attack the butterfly but the butterfly has a sticky wool like substance on their wings that disable the ants jaws, meaning it can take flight without being ripped apart by the ants.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous item found is the Nuzi map, which is the oldest known map ever discovered. It is unknown exactly what the Nuzi map charts, even though the {{majority}} of the tablet is preserved. The Nuzi map is <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the so-called Gasur texts, and predates the invasion of the city of Gasur by the Hurrians, who renamed it Nuzi. The cache of economic and business documents among which the map was found date to the Old Akkadian period (ca. 2360-2180 BC). Gasur was a thriving commercial center, and the texts reveal a varied business community with far reaching enterprises. It is possible that Ebla was a trading partner, and that the tablet, rather than a record of land-holdings, might indeed be a road map. The tablet, which is approximately 6 x 6.5cm., is inscribed only on the obverse. It shows the city of Maskan-dur-ebla in the lower left corner, as well and a canal/river and two mountain ranges.|$|E
25|$|England went to Australia the {{following}} winter and, in a controversial series, won The Ashes {{for the first}} time since Richie Benaud's team had beaten them in the 1958–59 series. England under Ray Illingworth were <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most successful Test teams of all time. They created a world record in official Test cricket of 27 consecutive Tests without defeat from 1968 to 1971; the record was equaled by Clive Lloyd's West Indies team between 1981 and 1984. At the time, however, the Rest of the World Tests were recognised as official and England's record run has only been confirmed retrospectively. England took sixteen players on tour and fourteen of these had featured against the Rest of the World. The other two were reserve wicket-keeper Bob Taylor and Yorkshire batsman John Hampshire. Alan Ward had to return home because of injury problems and was replaced by the young fast bowler Bob Willis, who made his Test debut on the tour.|$|E
25|$|Launched {{concurrently}} with Boat 10, with 42 people aboard, {{the last}} of the wooden lifeboats was launched under the supervision of Lightoller at 1:50a.m. with Quartermaster Walter Perkis put in charge. It was <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the first lifeboats to be lowered on Captain Smith's suggestion that passengers should be loaded from the Promenade Deck rather than the Boat Deck. However, the captain had forgotten that– unlike on his previous command, Titanics sister ship Olympic– the forward half of the Promenade Deck was enclosed. Lightoller ordered that the windows on the Promenade Deck's enclosure were to be opened, and moved on to deal with the other lifeboats. The windows proved unexpectedly difficult to open and to add to the problems, the lifeboat got caught up on Titanics sounding spar, which projected from the hull immediately below the boat. The spar had to be chopped off to allow the lifeboat to progress. A stack of deck chairs was used as a makeshift staircase to allow passengers to climb up and through the windows and into the boat.|$|E
