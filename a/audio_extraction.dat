40|$|<b>Audio</b> feature <b>extraction</b> is an {{essential}} and significant process where audio features are extracted from the audio files whereby the extracted audio features contains relevant audio information. One of the important roles played by the audio features {{is to improve the}} classification accuracy. However, the presence of noise in the audio signals which degrades the quality of the extracted features may result in low classification accuracy. Some of the existing <b>audio</b> feature <b>extraction</b> techniques are Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC), Linear Predictive Coding (LPC), Local Discriminant Bases (LDB), Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR) and Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP). Furthermore, the three frequently used techniques in <b>audio</b> feature <b>extraction</b> are MFCC, LPC and ZCR. Previous research had mentioned the shortcomings of the three techniques on extracting noisy signal. This has been identified in the case of traditional Indian musical instrument where the vibration of string instrument had produced noise in the highest amplitude. Therefore, Zero Forcing Equalizer (ZFE) was proposed to equalize the noise in the highest amplitude. ZFE was integrated with three <b>audio</b> feature <b>extraction</b> techniques, namely MFCC-ZFE, LPC-ZFE and ZCR-ZFE in order to improve the performance of the existing techniques. The results show the best improvement of classification accuracies obtained for the proposed techniques of MFCC-ZFE were 98. 2 % of classification accuracies with 4. 0 % of improvement by using kNN. Meanwhile, the combined features of the MFCC-ZFE + LPC-ZFE + ZCR-ZFE have obtained 98. 3 % of classification accuracies with 9. 1 % of improvement by using kNN...|$|R

40|$|FEATUR. UX (Feature - ous) is {{an audio}} {{visualization}} tool, {{currently in the}} process of development, which proposes to introduce a new approach to sound visualization using pre-mixed, independent multitracks and <b>audio</b> feature <b>extraction.</b> Sound visualization is usually performed using a final mix, mono or stereo track of <b>audio.</b> <b>Audio</b> feature <b>extraction</b> is commonly used in the field of music information retrieval to create search and recommendation systems for large music databases rather than generating live visualizations. Visualizing multitrack audio circumvents problems related to the source separation of mixed audio signals and presents an opportunity to examine interdependent relationships within and between separate streams of music. This novel approach to sound visualization aims to provide an enhanced accession to the listening experience corresponding to this use case that employs non-tonal, non-notated forms of electronic music. Findings from prior research studies focused on live performance and preliminary quantitative results from a user survey have provided the basis from which to develop a prototype that will be used throughout an iterative design study to examine the impact of using multitrack audio and <b>audio</b> feature <b>extraction</b> on sound visualization practice...|$|R
50|$|In {{the context}} of digital <b>audio</b> <b>extraction</b> from compact discs, seek jitter causes {{extracted}} audio samples to be doubled-up or skipped entirely if the Compact Disc drive re-seeks. The problem occurs because the Red Book does not require block-accurate addressing during seeking. As a result, the extraction process may restart a few samples early or late, resulting in doubled or omitted samples. These glitches often sound like tiny repeating clicks during playback. A successful approach to correction in software involves performing overlapping reads and fitting the data to find overlaps at the edges. Most extraction programs perform seek jitter correction. CD manufacturers avoid seek jitter by extracting the entire disc in one continuous read operation, using special CD drive models at slower speeds so the drive does not re-seek.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Music Information Retrieval has {{received}} increasing attention {{from both the}} industrial and the research communities in recent years. Many <b>audio</b> <b>extraction</b> techniques providing content-based music information have been developed, sparking the need for intelligent storage and retrieval facilities. This paper proposes to satisfy this need by extending technology from business-oriented data warehouses to so-called music warehouses that integrate a large variety of music-related information, including both low-level features and high-level musical information. Music warehouses thus help to close the “semantic gap ” by supporting integrated querying of these two kinds of music data. This paper presents {{a number of new}} challenges for the database community that must be taken up to meet the particular demands of music warehouses. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the music}} field, an open issue is {{represented}} by the creation of innovative tools for acquisition, preservation and sharing of information. The strong difficulties in preserving the original carriers, together dedicated equipments able to read any (often obsolete) format, encouraged the analog/digital (A/D) transfer of audio contents in order to make them available in digital libraries. Unfortunately, the A/D transfer is often an invasive process. This work proposes an innovative and not-invasive approach to <b>audio</b> <b>extraction</b> from complex source material, such as shellac phonographic discs: PoG (Photos Of Ghosts) is a new system, able to reconstruct the audio signal from a still image of a disc surface. It is automatic, needs of low-cost hardware, recognizes different rpm and performs an automatic separation of the tracks; also it is robust with respect to dust and scratches. ...|$|E

Data generated from the users actions is parsed to determine note changes and expressive intent. Pitch is innate to the recording, allowing the user to concentrate on expressive gesture. Two pre-processing systems, analysis to discover note starts and extraction, are necessary. Extraction of the solo is done through user provided mimicry of the target combined with Probabalistic Latent Component Analysis with Dirichlet Hyperparameters. Audio elongation to match the users performance is performed using time-stretch. Instrument interfaces used were Akais Electronic Wind Controller (EWI), Fender's Squier Stratocaster Guitar and Controller, and a Wii-mote. Tests of the system and concept were performed using the EWI and Wii-mote for re-performance of two songs. User response indicated that while the interaction was fun, it did not succeed at enabling significant expression. Users expressed difficulty learning to use the EWI during the short test window and had insufficient interest in the offered songs. Both problems should be possible to overcome with further test time and system development. Users expressed interest in the concept of a real instrument mimic and found the audio extractions to be sufficient. Follow-on work to address issues discovered during the testing phase is needed to further validate the concept and explore means of developing expressive re-performance as a learning tool. by Laurel S.

40|$|Despite careful storage, early {{mechanical}} recordings on cylinders {{and flat}} disc formats {{have been identified}} as at risk from deterioration, caused mainly by material degradation and biological attack from mould growth. There is therefore an urgency to transfer the content of culturally-important artefacts to digital format to preserve the recordings’ content for archival posterity. However, some recordings are too precious to risk playback using conventional stylus methods because the very act of using a mechanical stylus playback system may in some circumstances contribute to further damage to the integrity of the sound contained in the recording’s groove, caused by wear. Other artefacts, such as 78 s exhibiting delamination of the shellac from the metallic substrate, may be too damaged for a stylus to be a practical method for transfer. In recent years there has been a significant quantity of research aimed at developing optical measurement systems for mechanical recordings for non-contact sound recovery. 2 -D imaging systems using high-resolution photography have been developed for flat disc recordings where the sound modulations are encoded as lateral undulations of the sound-carrying groove. However, in cylinder recordings and some 78 s the modulations are in a vertical plane relative to the groove, in so-called ‘hill and dale’ modulations. To measure these features requires 3 -D surface profiling using optical sensors that measure the surface topology by determining the displacement distance between the surface and the sensor. Systems have been independently developed by the Ukrainian Institute for Information Recording Problems, Syracuse University (US) and Hokkaido University group in Japan for 3 D measurement of the sound carrying groove. However, these methods require a tracking system to guide the optical sensor in the nominally helical path around the cylinder to follow the groove. This tracking must be robust at time of measurement, a task which is made difficult by damage and deformation of the artefact’s surface. An alternative transfer strategy being developed through collaboration between the University of Southampton, the British Library Sound Archive, and TaiCaan Technologies Ltd, uses optical sensors to measure the recording’s surface in its entirety. A significant outcome from this approach is the full high precision digital record of the artefact’s surface form for preservation, which is available for future research. The post-measurement processing of the surface topology data makes use of image and signal processing to reconstruct the audio content of the recording. This aspect of the research is aimed at facilitating access to the audio content of culturally-important artefacts by current generations. In this paper we provide a detailed overview of the scanning process for cylinder recordings, the data processing techniques used to recover the audio from the data and describe the high sensor precision required for measuring the surface for successful <b>audio</b> <b>extraction.</b> We show examples of groove damage thought to originate from repeated stylus playback, and highlight the advantages offered by this scanning strategy for application to damaged or even broken recordings...|$|E
