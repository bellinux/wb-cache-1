5|$|As {{the name}} suggests, New Texas Giant is {{located within the}} Texas section of Six Flags Over Texas. It was Rocky Mountain Construction's first {{installation}} of I-Box track. New Texas Giant operates with three trains manufactured by Gerstlauer. The trains are themed to 1961 Cadillac Devilles. Each train {{is made up of}} six cars, each seating riders in two rows of two. Riders are restrained through the use of an individual hydraulic lap bar and <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
5|$|Holden's {{standardisation}} of six airbags in March 2008 for MY09 {{made the}} VE {{eligible for the}} ANCAP side pole test, yielding additional scoring points. The second stage of the VE's safety rollout in October 2008 for MY09.5 included the addition of an energy absorbing steering column shroud and redesigned rear door latches across the VE range. The inclusion of <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> reminder on the Omega sedan yielded another point, thus allowing the Omega sedan to score five-stars, or a score of 33.45 when tested the following December. The Omega Sportwagon was the next model to be awarded the full five stars the following February, following the addition of <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> reminder in Sportwagon production. The remaining VE models, including the Ute and WM Statesman/Caprice, which had already received most of the safety upgrades, received the seat belt reminder as standard fitment as of MY10 production from August 2009. As a result, all VE sedan and Sportwagon variants along with the extended length WM models received the five-star rating. The VE Ute officially received the rating on 19 October 2009, making the entire line-up of Australian-made Holdens five-star ANCAP rated.|$|E
5|$|Iron Rattler {{is located}} in the Western-themed Crackaxle Canyon area of Fiesta Texas, sitting next to the Road Runner Express and The Gully Washer. It is Rocky Mountain Construction's second {{installation}} of I-Box track, and the first to feature a barrel roll inversion. Iron Rattler operates with two Rattler-themed trains manufactured by Gerstlauer. Each train is made up of six cars which seat riders in two rows of two. Riders are restrained {{through the use of a}} lap bar and <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E

5|$|Magnum XL-200 {{has three}} white-and-black trains. Each train has red, black or blue {{striping}} at the front. Each train has six cars; riders are arranged two-across in three rows {{for a total}} of 36 riders per train. Magnum was the first coaster in which Arrow Dynamics used its Hypercoaster trains, which were subsequently installed on dozens of other new rides. Riders are secured by a single lap bar and <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
5|$|Non-use of {{seat belts}} is a {{significant}} risk factor. According to Col. Tom Butler, chief of the Montana Highway Patrol, preliminary 2015 data indicated that 178 of the 224 vehicle occupant fatalities were of individuals not wearing seat belts. The fine in Montana for not wearing <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> in 2015 was $20. Although speed limits increased from 75mph to 80mph on rural interstates that year, the biggest statewide increase in both crashes and deaths occurred on secondary roads. Forty-three people died on Montana two-lane roads outside of towns that are neither U.S. or state highways.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín {{suffered}} {{a car crash}} in the Río Negro province in 1999, during the campaign of governor Pablo Verani. They were on Route6, and he was ejected from the car {{because he was not}} wearing <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt.</b> He was hospitalized for 39 days. DelaRúa became president in the 1999 elections, defeating the governor of Buenos Aires, Eduardo Duhalde. Alfonsín was elected Senator for Buenos Aires Province in October 2001. DelaRúa resigned during the December 2001 riots, and the Congress appointed Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, who resigned as well. Alfonsín instructed the radical legislators to support Duhalde as the new president. He also gave him two ministers, Horacio Jaunarena for Defense and Jorge Vanossi for Justice. The radical support helped Duhalde overcome the ambitions of Carlos Ruckauf and José Manuel de la Sota, who also had ambitions to be appointed president. Alfonsín's health problems later in the year led him to step down, to be replaced by Diana Conti.|$|E

25|$|The Australian {{delivered}} U13 Bluebird {{was released}} in late 1993 and terminated in 1997. Series 1 ran from 1993 until 1995 while Series 2 ran from 1995 to 1997. Series 2 saw {{the addition of a}} driver's airbag, revised grille styling, and <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> warning light. The Series 1 LX model came equipped with cruise control standard but strangely it was an option on the Series 2.|$|E
25|$|The North American cars {{also had}} {{different}} equipment levels (depending on the version: Milano Silver, Milano Gold or Milano Platinum). L/h and r/h electrically adjustable outside mirrors, electrically reclining seats and cruise control were usually optional in Europe. The car was also available with a 3-speed ZF automatic gearbox {{option for the}} 2.5 V6. Other, more common options such as electrically operated rear windows and an A/C system were standard in the USA. The USA-cars also had different upholstery styles and of course different dashboard panels also indicating speed in mph, oil pressure in psi and coolant temperature in degrees F, and as a final touch the AR control was different, including <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> warning light.|$|E

500|$|All B hyper {{coasters}} use a type {{of restraint}} called a [...] "T-bar" [...] or [...] "Clamshell" [...] restraint, which consists of bar with a cushioned lap bar with two handles for riders to hold on to. This type of restraint generally does not use <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt,</b> however seat belts {{have been added to}} Behemoth and Leviathan at Canada's Wonderland, Diamondback at Kings Island, and Intimidator at Carowinds, all of which have the stadium style seating. Bolliger & Mabillard also uses over-the-shoulder restraints, in that the restraint is placed over the riders' shoulders and sits and extends to the riders' laps. This type of restraint is used on Dive, Inverted, Sitting, Flying, Floorless, Stand-up, and Wing Coasters.|$|E
500|$|Corzine and {{the trooper}} were flown by {{helicopter}} to Cooper University Hospital in Camden, a Level I trauma center. The aide {{was taken by}} ambulance to Atlantic City Medical Center. Neither the NJ State Trooper nor the aide was seriously injured, but Corzine suffered broken bones, including an open fracture of the left femur, 11 broken ribs, a broken sternum, a broken collarbone, a fractured lower vertebra, and a facial cut that required plastic surgery. The Governor was not wearing <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt.</b> Friends had long {{said that they had}} rarely seen him wear one. When asked why the state trooper who was driving would not have asked Corzine to put on his seat belt, a staffer said the governor was [...] "not always amenable to suggestion".

50|$|Studies of {{accident}} outcomes suggest that fatality rates among car occupants are reduced by between 30 and 50 percent if <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> are worn.
