The measures involved delivery of the 2013 <b>air</b> <b>cleaning</b> program, linkage mechanism with the three surrounding provinces and improvement of the ability of early warning of emergency situation. On 12 February 2014, China's cabinet announced that a 10-billion-renminbi (US$1.7-billion) fund will be set up to help companies to meet new environmental standards.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} health industry, {{antimicrobial}} surfaces have been utilized {{for their ability to}} keep surfaces cleaned. Either the physical nature of the surface, [...] or the chemical make up can be manipulated to create an environment which cannot be inhabited by microorganisms for a variety of different reasons. Photocatalytic materials have been used for their ability to kill many microorganisms and therefore can be used for self-cleaning surfaces as well as <b>air</b> <b>cleaning,</b> water purification, and antitumor activity.|$|E
2500|$|Buildings are {{designed}} or intended to respond actively {{to some of}} these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, <b>air</b> <b>cleaning</b> or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and maintain surfaces to enhance their appearance, performance, or longevity. [...] In other cases, such changes subtly or even dramatically alter buildings in ways that may be important to their own integrity or their impact on building occupants through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may find it useful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, some of the approaches used by scientists studying ecosystems, in order to gain an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we spend the majority of our time, our buildings.|$|E

2500|$|The tractor used a , inline four-cylinder engine. The {{engine was}} similar to the Ford Model T engine in many respects. Like many engines of its day, it was multifuel-capable; it was usually tuned for {{gasoline}} or kerosene, but alcohol could also be burned. (Tractor vaporising oil [...] existed in 1920 but was not yet widely used. It entered broader use in the 1930s and 1940s.) Like many other multifuel machines, the Fordson started on gasoline from a small auxiliary tank (just a few quarts) and then switched over to the main fuel tank once warmed up sufficiently (no more than 5 minutes). To handle the kerosene (or, rarely, TVO), the intake system had a vaporizer downstream of the carburetor. The mixture coming from the carburetor was intentionally rich, and the vaporizer heated it and mixed it with more air to lean it out to the final ratio before entering the intake manifold. The intake system also had a water-bath air cleaner to filter the dust out of the air inhaled by the engine (an invention that did not originate at Ford but that was still rather novel in 1917). <b>Air</b> <b>cleaning</b> is critical to engine lifespan, even for road vehicles and most especially for farming and construction vehicles (which work in environments where dirt is frequently stirred up into the air). The Fordson carburetor and air cleaner were designed by Holley. In later decades, the water bath would be replaced with an oil bath for better filtering performance.|$|E
