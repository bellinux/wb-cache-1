5|$|The Levels {{contain the}} best-preserved prehistoric {{village in the}} UK, Glastonbury Lake Village, {{as well as two}} others at Meare Lake Village. Discovered in 1892 by Arthur Bulleid, it was {{inhabited}} by about 200people living in 14roundhouses, and was built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracken, rubble <b>and</b> <b>clay.</b>|$|E
30|$|It {{is shown}} in the {{previous}} sections that the compression behaviour of different sands <b>and</b> <b>clays</b> (separately) can be uniquely represented using the new normalisation scheme. An obvious step forward thus would be to directly compare the compression response of sands <b>and</b> <b>clays</b> so that a unified compression relationship could be developed for both soils.|$|R

5|$|The land {{beneath the}} Bay Area {{consists}} of layers of sand <b>and</b> <b>clay</b> to great depths.

5|$|When Scott Rudin was {{adapting}} Wonder Boys for the screen, {{the author}} declined {{an offer to}} write the screenplay, saying {{he was too busy}} writing The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier <b>and</b> <b>Clay.</b> Directed by Curtis Hanson and starring Michael Douglas, Wonder Boys was released in 2000 to critical acclaim and financial failure. Having bought the film rights to The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier <b>and</b> <b>Clay,</b> Rudin then asked Chabon to work on that film's screenplay. Although Chabon spent 16 months in 2001 and 2002 working on the novel's film adaptation, the project has been mired in pre-production for years.|$|E
40|$|The {{geological}} {{composition is}} essential for the pedogenetical processes. The Oas Mountains have a special complexity, caused by the subsequent magmatism. From a lithological point of view, we can mention the rhyolites and volcanic agglomerates followed by dacites, pyroxenic hyalodacites, porphyric, pyroxenic microgranodiorites, sands <b>and</b> <b>clays</b> with gravels intercalations, sandy <b>clays</b> <b>and</b> <b>clays</b> with coal lenses...|$|R
50|$|Sediments eroding {{from the}} rising Rocky Mountains {{to the west}} washed into the sea and {{deposited}} as layered wedges of fine debris. As sand, mud, <b>and</b> <b>clays</b> accumulated, the Sundance Sea retreated northward.

5|$|While {{some wild}} {{narcissi}} are specific {{in terms of}} their ecological requirements, most garden varieties are relatively tolerant of soil conditions, however very wet soils <b>and</b> <b>clay</b> soils may benefit from the addition of sand to improve drainage.

5|$|A recent {{geological}} formation, Carabane {{consists of}} a shoal and alluvium. The alluvium has developed because of the saltwater streams that cut across the shoal. As pointed out by early French observers, soils {{in the region are}} generally composed of sand <b>and</b> <b>clay,</b> differing in mixture and layer according to natural and human factors. However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand. The lack of clay is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks. This type of architecture is also common in the villages of Mlomp and Seleki.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{excavation}} {{also revealed}} evidence for modern activity around the site.

Finds from this period included ceramic sherds, clay pipes dated from between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, stone <b>and</b> <b>clay</b> marbles, brick tile, and bottles dated from between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. Alexander suggested that this evidence confirmed local accounts that it had been used as a popular spot for picnics. There are also accounts that it came {{to be used as a}} well-known rabbit warren in the local area.|$|E
5|$|Bordering Prospect Park is Devil's Dip, {{a former}} gravel <b>and</b> <b>clay</b> pit.

Other flora found at the site include nettle, bramble and elder, with flowers such as lesser celandine, bluebells and Queen Anne's lace appearing in the spring. Peacock butterflies and various species of woodland bird are prevalent in the area.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} {{engineering}} classification system for soils in North America is the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS). The USCS has three major classification groups: (1) coarse-grained soils (e.g. sands and gravels); (2) fine-grained soils (e.g. silts and clays); and (3) highly organic soils (referred to as [...] "peat"). The USCS further subdivides {{the three major}} soil classes for clarification. It distinguishes sands from gravels by grain size, and further classifying some as [...] "well-graded" [...] and the rest as [...] "poorly-graded". Silts <b>and</b> <b>clays</b> are distinguished by the soils' Atterberg limits, and separates [...] "high-plasticity" [...] from [...] "low-plasticity" [...] soils as well. Moderately organic soils are considered subdivisions of silts <b>and</b> <b>clays,</b> <b>and</b> are distinguished from inorganic soils by changes in their plasticity properties (and Atterberg limits) on drying. The European soil classification system (ISO 14688) is very similar, differing primarily in coding and in adding an [...] "intermediate-plasticity" [...] classification for silts <b>and</b> <b>clays,</b> <b>and</b> in minor details.|$|R
40|$|This work {{showed that}} the {{adsorption}} of glyphosate (GPS) depends on surface area for <b>clays</b> <b>and</b> amount of <b>clays</b> <b>and</b> CEC for soils. Organic matter (OM) had a secondary role in the adsorption of GPS on soils. The adsorption of GPS on soils from Londrina and Floraí counties <b>and</b> <b>clays</b> (montmorillonite, kaolinite) decreased when pH increased, however, for bentonite <b>clay</b> <b>and</b> soil from Tibagi county was kept constant. For the soils, the competitive adsorption between GPS and phosphate showed that displace of GPS by phosphate {{was related to the}} amount of <b>clays,</b> CEC <b>and</b> pH. GPS was not easily displaced by phosphate on the clays. The FT-IR spectra of the soils <b>and</b> <b>clays</b> showed that soil from Londrina resembled kaolinite. Thus, this could explain the results of adsorption of GPS and the competitive adsorption between GPS and phosphate...|$|R
