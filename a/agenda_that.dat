5|$|My {{interpretation}} {{is that she}} isn’t {{trying to keep the}} secret. That she doesn’t care. She changed her last name to avoid getting kidnapped, but really, if anyone figured it out and asked her, she’d just probably be like “Yeah, shut up!” or whatever. I feel like everyone at ISIS is so self-involved and so concerned with furthering their own <b>agenda</b> <b>that</b> it would never occur to them to think that anyone else has anything else going on.|$|E
5|$|Governor Crittenden {{resigned}} on July 31, 1850 {{to accept}} President Millard Fillmore's appointment as attorney general, and Helm ascended to the governorship. As governor, Helm vetoed a legislative plan to cover deficits {{in the public}} school fund by drawing money from the state's sinking fund, but the General Assembly overrode the veto. He urged the legislature to fund a survey of the state's mineral reserves and a census of the state's agricultural and manufacturing resources. He called for spending on internal improvements and for raising judges' salaries to attract more qualified jurists to the bench. He also sought a ban on the carrying of concealed deadly weapons. The legislature did not act on any of these proposed reforms. The only part of Helm's <b>agenda</b> <b>that</b> did progress through the General Assembly was election reform.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, he photographed sites {{associated}} with the prominent Marxists Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. He also photographed the signs erected by landowners and religious groups, believing that in doing so he was documenting the traces of capitalist society before they would be swept away by socialism. Both in Britain and {{on a visit to}} Germany he photographed pro-fascist and anti-fascist propaganda and graffiti. Like many leftists at the time, he believed that fascism was a temporary, extreme expression of capitalist society that would soon be overcome by socialism. He nevertheless expressed admiration for the German archaeological establishment under the Nazi government, highlighting that the British state lagged far behind in terms of funding excavations and encouraging the study of archaeology in universities; he refrained from commenting on the political <b>agenda</b> <b>that</b> the Nazis had in promoting archaeology.|$|E

5|$|Washington was not {{a member}} of any {{political}} party and hoped {{that they would not be}} formed, fearing conflict that would undermine republicanism. His closest advisors formed two factions, setting the framework for the future First Party System. Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton had bold plans to establish the national credit and to build a financially powerful nation, and he formed the basis of the Federalist Party. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson was the founder of the Jeffersonian Republicans, and he strenuously opposed Hamilton's agenda. Washington typically favored Hamilton over Jefferson, and it was Hamilton's <b>agenda</b> <b>that</b> went into effect. Jefferson's political actions, his support of Philip Freneau's National Gazette, and his attempt to undermine Hamilton nearly led George Washington to dismiss him from his cabinet, though he ultimately left the cabinet voluntarily. Washington never forgave him and never spoke to him again.|$|E
5|$|Angered {{over his}} electoral loss, Randolph harangued anti-Harrison supporters, even {{challenging}} {{one to a}} duel. He was stabbed three times, but recovered and challenged Jennings in his bid for reelection in 1810. Harrison came out to personally stump on Randolph's behalf. Jennings focused on the slavery issue and tied Randolph to Harrison's continued attempts to legalize the institution. The congressional election coincided with the first popular election of delegates to the territorial legislature. In 1809, a year prior to the election, the territory's pro-slavery faction suffered a significant setback when Illinois was separated from the Indiana Territory, cutting Harrison off from his supporters in the western portion of the territory. Harrison suggested that Jennings further expanded his political base by stumping among the disaffected French residents of the territory. Jennings's defeat of Randolph in 1810 repudiated Harrison's pro-slavery policies. Following his triumph in the election, Jennings's and his anti-slavery allies were successful in enacting a legislative <b>agenda</b> <b>that</b> limited the territorial governor's authority and repealed an 1805 act regarding indentured service.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} {{continued to}} view rural education as an <b>agenda</b> <b>that</b> could be relatively free from bureaucratic backlog and general stagnation. However, {{in some cases}} lack of financing balanced the gains made by rural education institutes of India. Some ideas failed to find acceptability among India's poor and investments made by the government sometimes yielded little results. Today, government rural schools remain poorly funded and understaffed. Several foundations, such as the Rural Development Foundation (Hyderabad), actively build high-quality rural schools, {{but the number of}} students served is small.|$|E
25|$|The Chávez {{platform}} comprised {{three basic}} pledges. First, Chávez promised {{that he would}} begin his presidency by abolishing Venezuela's old puntofijismo political system of two-party patronage, and opening up political power to independent and third parties. Second, Chávez promised to end corruption. Third, Chávez promised to eradicate poverty in Venezuela. In working to gain the trust of voters, Chávez drafted an <b>agenda</b> <b>that</b> drew heavily on his interpretation of Bolivarianism. Chávez also utilized his charisma and flamboyant public speaking stylenoted for its abundance of colloquialisms and ribald manneron the campaign trail to help win the trust and favor of a primarily poor and working class following.|$|E
50|$|Secondly, Keohane and Nye {{argue that}} there is not, in fact, a {{hierarchy}} among issues, meaning that not only is the martial arm of foreign policy not the supreme tool by which to carry out a state's <b>agenda,</b> but <b>that</b> there are a multitude of different <b>agendas</b> <b>that</b> come to the forefront. The line between domestic and foreign policy becomes blurred in this case, as realistically there is no clear agenda in interstate relations.|$|R

25|$|In {{the mid-1990s}} I {{was part of}} what is now known as the {{emerging}} church and spent some time traveling the country to speak on the emerging church in the emerging culture on a team put together by Leadership Network called the Young Leader Network. But, I eventually had to distance myself from the emergent stream of the network because friends like Brian McLaren and Doug Pagitt began pushing a theological <b>agenda</b> <b>that</b> greatly troubled me. Examples include referring to God as a chick, questioning God's sovereignty over and knowledge of the future, denial of the substitutionary atonement at the cross, a low view of Scripture, and denial of hell which is one hell of a mistake.|$|E
25|$|The Fascist {{government}} {{endorsed a}} stringent education policy in Italy aiming at eliminating illiteracy, {{which was a}} serious problem in Italy at the time, as well as improving the allegiance of Italians to the state. To reduce drop-outs, the government changed the minimum age of leaving school from twelve to fourteen and strictly enforced attendance. The Fascist government's first minister of education from 1922 to 1924 Giovanni Gentile recommended that education policy should focus on indoctrination of students into Fascism and to educate youth to respect and be obedient to authority. In 1929, education policy took a major step towards being completely {{taken over by the}} agenda of indoctrination. In that year, the Fascist government took control of the authorization of all textbooks, all secondary school teachers were required to take an oath of loyalty to Fascism and children began to be taught that they owed the same loyalty to Fascism as they did to God. In 1933, all university teachers were required to be members of the National Fascist Party. From the 1930s to 1940s, Italy's education focused on the history of Italy displaying Italy as a force of civilization during the Roman era, displaying the rebirth of Italian nationalism and the struggle for Italian independence and unity during the Risorgimento. In the late 1930s, the Fascist government copied Nazi Germany's education system on the issue of physical fitness and began an <b>agenda</b> <b>that</b> demanded that Italians become physically healthy.|$|E

500|$|Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University {{thought that}} in Tintin in America, Hergé had {{intentionally}} depicted the wealthy industrialists {{as being very}} similar to the gangsters. He noted that this negative portrayal of capitalists continued into later Adventures of Tintin with characters such as Basil Barazov in The Broken Ear. He considered this indicative of [...] "a more ambivalent stance" [...] to the right-wing <b>agenda</b> <b>that</b> Hergé had formerly adhered to. Another literary critic, Tom McCarthy, concurred, believing that Tintin in America exhibited Hergé's [...] "left-wing counter tendency" [...] through attacking the racism and capitalist mass production of the U.S. McCarthy believed that the work exposed social and political process as a [...] "mere charade", much as Hergé had previously done in Tintin in the Land of the Soviets.|$|E

Her slogan was to make [...] "Uttar Pradesh" [...] ("Northern Province") into [...] "Uttam Pradesh" [...] ("Excellent Province"). Her government began a major crackdown on irregularities in the recruitment process of police officers recruited during the previous Mulayam Singh government. Over 18,000 policemen lost their jobs for irregularities in their hiring, and 25 Indian Police Service officers were suspended for their involvement in corruption while recruiting the constables. Mayawati instituted reforms to introduce transparency into the recruiting process, including posting the results of selection exams online.|$|E
500|$|As he readied for the 1948 election, Truman {{made clear}} his {{identity}} as a Democrat in the New Deal tradition, advocating national health insurance, and repeal of the Taft–Hartley Act. He broke with the New Deal by initiating an aggressive civil rights program, which he termed a moral priority. Taken together, it constituted a broad legislative <b>agenda</b> <b>that</b> {{came to be called}} the [...] "Fair Deal." [...] Truman's proposals were not well received by Congress, even with renewed Democratic majorities in Congress after 1948. The Solid South rejected civil rights, as those states still enforced segregation. Only one of the major Fair Deal bills, the Housing Act of 1949, was ever enacted. On the other hand, the major New Deal programs still in operation were not repealed, and there were minor improvements and extensions in many of them.|$|E

In response, Wilkinson said that Jones should [...] "be involved in improving the process, not be so negative about everything" [...] and [...] "pay attention to his own business".
