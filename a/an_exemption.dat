5|$|US 206 was widened in Byram Township to six lanes.

The widening is being done in order to eliminate backups on the current two-lane stretch during rush hours. The project was slated to be finished in November 2013.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's volunteers {{responded to}} {{requests}} for military service {{in the early months}} of the war; however, as the war progressed and the number of casualties increased, the state government had to resort to conscription (the draft) to fill its quotas. Military conscription, which began in October 1862, was a divisive issue within the state. It was especially unpopular among Democrats, who viewed it as a threat to individual freedom and opposed legislation that allowed a man to purchase <b>an</b> <b>exemption</b> for $300 or pay another person to serve as his substitute. A total of 3,003 Hoosier men were drafted in October 1862; subsequent drafts in Indiana brought the total to 17,903.|$|E

The Treasury Department issued a regulation in 2004, declaring those who worked more than 40 hours a week were ineligible for such <b>an</b> <b>exemption.</b> The Mayo Foundation filed suit to challenge the regulation and for a refund of the taxes it had paid on its medical residentsâ€”recently graduated physicians who work more than full-time providing patient care, but who are still considered trainees by the medical profession. The District Court ruled for the Mayo Foundation and struck the regulation, but was reversed by the Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} he {{returned}} to Scotland and became the organist at Glasgow's Barony Church; however, as he had no School Leaving Certificate, he could not study at a university. Due {{to the influence of}} his future wife, Diana Brodie, he approached several influential music friends for letters of support for <b>an</b> <b>exemption</b> to enter university. In 1928, he was accepted to study music at the University of Edinburgh, under his friend and mentor, the renowned musicologist Sir Donald Tovey. Chisholm graduated with a Bachelor of Music degree in 1931 and as Doctor of Music in 1934. While at university, he had formed the Scottish Ballet Society in 1928 and the Active Society for the Propagation of Contemporary Music in 1929 with fellow composers Francis George Scott and Pat Shannon. In 1930 to 1934 he also worked as a music critic for the Glasgow Weekly Herald and the Scottish Daily Express.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} of diversifying revenues, as three-fourths of revenue gathered was from commerce with Great Britain, Hamilton attempted once again during his Report on Public Credit when presenting it in 1790 to implement an excise tax both imported and domestic spirits. The taxation rate was graduated {{in proportion to}} the whiskey proof, and Hamilton intended to equalize the tax burden on imported spirits with imported and domestic liquor. In lieu of the excise on production citizens could pay 60 cents by the gallon of dispensing capacity, along with <b>an</b> <b>exemption</b> on small stills used exclusively for domestic consumption. He realized the loathing that the tax would receive in rural areas, but thought of the taxing of spirits more reasonable than land taxes.|$|E
5|$|One major anomaly {{remained}} in the railway's operations: the 1889 Regulation of Railways Act had required, amongst other measures, that all British passenger trains be fitted with continuous brakes. McConnel had secured <b>an</b> <b>exemption</b> for the Talyllyn Railway, {{on the basis that}} the low speed of operation meant they were unnecessary and that the cost of compliance would bankrupt the enterprise, {{but by the end of}} the 1990s the Railway Inspectorate was insisting that the Talyllyn be brought into compliance with the act, a little over 100years after it had passed. By 2001, the railway had fitted its entire passenger fleet with the necessary equipment, operated by air brake pumps mounted on the locomotives.|$|E
5|$|Skyscrapers {{continued}} to spread both across the U.S. and internationally. New York and Chicago remained {{the center of}} skyscraper development, but most major cities in the U.S. had built skyscrapers by 1929, frequently {{as a result of}} competition between rival cities for status and investment. Cincinnati built the Cincinnati Towers in 1914, followed by the Carew Tower Complex in 1930. In Detroit, the General Motors Building opened in 1920 and the Fisher Building in 1928. Cleveland acquired the Union Trust Building in 1923 and the Terminal Tower in 1929; the latter, built by the Van Sweringen brothers, was, for a short period, the second tallest building in the world. Seattle had built Smith Tower in 1914, and the Los Angeles local government granted itself <b>an</b> <b>exemption</b> from city planning restrictions in order to build the Los Angeles City Hall in 1928. In 1928, the Industrial Trust Tower was built in Providence.|$|E

5|$|While Speer had {{tremendous}} power, {{he was of}} course subordinate to Hitler. Nazi officials sometimes went around Speer by seeking direct orders from the dictator. When Speer ordered peacetime building work suspended, the Gauleiters (Nazi Party district leaders) obtained <b>an</b> <b>exemption</b> for their pet projects. When Speer sought the appointment of Hanke as a labor czar to optimize the use of German and slave labor, Hitler, {{under the influence of}} Martin Bormann, instead appointed Fritz Sauckel. Rather than increasing female labor and taking other steps to better organize German labor, as Speer favored, Sauckel advocated importing more slave labour from the occupied nationsâ€“ and did so, obtaining workers for (among other things) Speer's armament factories, often using the most brutal methods.|$|E
5|$|With no {{resources}} available from either Congress or the Continental Army, Irvine gave permission for volunteers to organize their own offensive. Detroit {{was too far}} and too strong for a small-scale operation, but militiamen such as David Williamson believed that an expedition against the American Indian towns on the Sandusky River was feasible. It {{was to be a}} low-budget campaign. Each volunteer had to provide at his expense a horse, rifle, ammunition, rations, and other equipment. Their only payment would be <b>an</b> <b>exemption</b> from two months of militia duty, plus whatever plunder might be taken from the Indians. Because of ongoing Indian raidsâ€”the wife and children of a Baptist minister were killed and scalped in western Pennsylvania on May 12, 1782â€”there was no shortage of men willing to volunteer.|$|E
5|$|The Abbey of Saint Mary de Pratis, more {{commonly}} known as Leicester Abbey, was an Augustinian religious house {{in the city of}} Leicester, in the English Midlands. The abbey was founded in the 12th century by the Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester, and grew to become the wealthiest religious establishment within Leicestershire. Through patronage and donations the abbey gained the advowsons of countless churches throughout England, and acquired a considerable amount of land, and several manorial lordships. Leicester Abbey also maintained a cell (a small dependent daughter house) at Cockerham Priory, in Lancashire. The Abbey's prosperity was boosted though the passage of special privileges by both the English Kings and the Pope. These included <b>an</b> <b>exemption</b> from sending representatives to parliament and from paying tithe on certain land and livestock. Despite its privileges and sizeable landed estates, from the late 14th century the abbey began to suffer financially and was forced to lease out its estates. The worsening financial situation was exacerbated throughout the 15th century and early 16th century by a series of incompetent, corrupt and extravagant abbots. By 1535 the abbey's considerable income was exceeded by even more considerable debts.|$|E
