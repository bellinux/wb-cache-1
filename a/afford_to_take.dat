Not particularly well-off financially, he had to work full-time and throughout his career could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> too much time away from business. He played cricket as often as he could in the summer; when unable to play for Middlesex, he played weekend club cricket—including for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)—and country house cricket.|$|E

He sold the company for £100,000 at the end of 1971 to British businessman Bernie Ecclestone, Rindt's former manager and erstwhile owner of the Connaught team. Tauranac stayed on to design the cars and run the factory.|$|E
5|$|Although the British {{ships were}} {{substantially}} larger than any individual French vessel, the frigates were more numerous and more manoeuvrable. Neither side could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> significant {{damage in the}} battle, so each sought to drive the other off rather than achieve an outright victory. On 9 September Sercey's frigates formed a line of battle, successfully engaging first Arrogant and then Victorious and inflicting damage on each while preventing them from supporting one another. The French frigates, particularly Vertu and Seine, also suffered and by late morning both sides disengaged, the British retiring to Madras for repairs while Sercey anchored at King's Island in the Mergui Archipelago, eventually sheltering in Batavia.|$|E

With no money available for transfers {{he was forced to}} turn to the youth team for new players, though he could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on Ian Nimmo, Hugh Dowd, John Dowie and Billy Russell on free transfers. He appointed former Leeds coach Les Cocker as his assistant. The season started poorly, but the squad bonded following Cocker's death on 4 October and went on a run of six straight wins, for which Bremner was credited with the Fourth Division Manager of the Month award. However a run of just one win in 15 games followed, for which Bremner blamed his small squad and lack of training facilities. A mounting injury crisis caused him to make a return to playing on 29 March for the visit of Bournemouth, a game in which 16-year-old Ian Snodin was named on the bench. Rovers ended the season in 12th place.|$|E
5|$|The ship briefly {{operated}} between Glasgow {{and other}} ports in Scotland for Hutcheson's West Highland Service {{before she was}} purchased in September 1861 by James D. Bulloch, the primary foreign agent in Great Britain for the Confederacy, to deliver the military and naval ordnance and supplies that he had purchased. To disguise his control of Fingal, and the destination of her cargo, Bulloch hired an English crew and captain and put out his destination as Bermuda and Nassau in the Bahamas. The cargo was loaded in Greenock in early October, although Bullock and the other passengers would not attempt to board until they rendezvoused with the ship at Holyhead, Wales. On the night 14/15 October, as she was slowly rounding the breakwater at Holyhead, Fingal rammed and sank the Austrian brig Siccardi, slowly swinging at anchor without lights. Bulloch and the passengers embarked in the steamer while Bulloch dispatched {{a letter to his}} financial agents instructing them to settle damages with the brig's owners because he could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the time to deal with the affair lest he and Fingal be detained. The ship reached Bermuda on 2 November and, after leaving port on 7 November, Bulloch informed the crew that the steamer's real destination was Savannah, Georgia; he offered to take anyone who objected to the plan to Nassau. However, all of the crew agreed to join in the effort to run the Union blockade. Fingal was able slip safely into the Savannah estuary in a heavy fog on the night of 12 November without sighting any blockaders.|$|E

50|$|In {{motorcycle}} racing {{the term}} 'wild card' {{is used for}} competitors only involved in individual rounds of a championship, usually their local round. Local riders taking advantage of their local knowledge (often having raced that circuit on that bike before) and <b>affording</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> risks without planning for a championship, often upset established runners. Makoto Tamada and Shaky Byrne have both taken double victories in Superbike World Championship rounds in their home countries. The most famous wild card entry perhaps was the late Daijiro Kato with finishing 3rd at his first appearance in 1996 and then winning the Japanese 250cc Grand Prix back to back in 1997 and 1998 {{on his way to}} become the most successful 250cc World Champion of all time in 2001.|$|R

Boyce, {{authors of}} Variation in Porotic Hyperostosis in the Royal Cemetery Complex at Abydos, Upper Egypt: A Social Interpretation, {{examined}} forty-four skulls from the funerary complex of King Djer {{and discovered that}} those buried outside the tomb enjoyed better health {{than those in the}} actual tomb. This can be interpreted in two ways. First, those buried outside the tomb were believed to have enjoyed better health because they were wealthier, and consequently, had better nutritional standards. The second is that those buried inside the royal tomb could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of their illness-ridden children. Whichever explanation is correct, there is such a statistically significant difference that these two groups most likely did not share the same social status.|$|E
25|$|In England, by the 1890s, {{a long-standing}} Rugby Football Union ban on {{professional}} players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were {{working class and}} could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not {{very different from what}} had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in Huddersfield to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport.|$|E
25|$|Thirty-five years later, Babette Hersant (Stéphane Audran) {{appears at}} their door. She carries only {{a letter from}} Papin, {{explaining}} {{that she is a}} refugee from counter-revolutionary bloodshed in Paris, and recommending her as a housekeeper. The sisters cannot <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Babette in, but she offers to work for free. Babette serves as their cook for the next 14 years, producing an improved version of the bland meals typical of the abstemious nature of the congregation, and slowly gaining their respect. Her only link to her former life is a lottery ticket that a friend in Paris renews for her every year. One day, she wins the lottery of 10,000 francs. Instead of using the money to return to Paris and her lost lifestyle, she decides to spend it preparing a delicious dinner for the sisters and their small congregation {{on the occasion of the}} founding pastor's hundredth birthday. More than just a feast, the meal is an outpouring of Babette's appreciation, an act of self-sacrifice; Babette tells no one that she is spending her entire winnings on the meal.|$|E
50|$|During the Great Depression, {{some of the}} {{opportunities}} <b>afforded</b> <b>to</b> women <b>took</b> a backseat and society seemed to reverse its views, reverting to more traditional roles. This affected women working in business; however, it {{also served as a}} push to those involved in the entrepreneurial world. More women began to start their own businesses, looking to survive during this time of hardship. In 1938, Hattie Moseley Austin, who had begun to sell chicken and biscuits after her husband died, opened Hattie's Chicken Shack in Saratoga Springs, NY.|$|R

25|$|In 1812 Blackford moved west. His {{reason for}} leaving New Jersey is unclear, {{as he had}} a {{potentially}} prosperous life in the east, his family was there, {{and the prospect of}} earning a living as a lawyer on the frontier was uncertain. Having spent most of his funds on education, Blackford could not to <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the stage coach and walked from New Jersey to the Allegany River where he traveled downriver by raft to Cincinnati and then continued on foot to Dayton. He lived only briefly in Dayton and continued further west, moving into the Indiana Territory and first living in Brookville. He carried with him letters of introduction to territorial Judge Isaac Dunn, a friend of George MacDonald. The letter helped him to quickly establish himself among the small legal community in the territory. Brookville was the administrative center of the eastern half of the territory, but Blackford had little chance of making a substantial income as a lawyer there, so he sought work in the civil service. He moved again to Salem where he was appointed by Governor William Henry Harrison to be clerk and recorder in the newly formed Washington County.|$|E

500|$|Yardley {{then called}} upon the {{occasional}} leg spin of Hutton {{in an attempt}} to exploit the turning wicket. The latter had taken only four wickets in the 1947 English season and had never dismissed an Australian batsman in ten Tests against such opponents. As Australia were still behind the required run rate, Yardley could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> risks and sacrifice some runs if he got wickets in return. Morris promptly joined Bradman in the counter-attack, hitting three consecutive fours from Hutton's first over, which Fingleton described as [...] "rather terrible" [...] due to the errant length. This over took Morris to 51. After an economical over from Compton, Bradman took two fours off Hutton's next over before almost holing out to Yardley. Despite the near miss, the 20 runs from Hutton's two inaccurate overs had allowed Australia to reach 96/1 from 90 minutes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} predict the future movements (location and gaze direction) of basketball players as a whole from their first person videos. The predicted behaviors reflect an individual physical space that <b>affords</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the next actions while conforming to social behaviors by engaging to joint attention. Our key innovation is to use the 3 D reconstruction of multiple first person cameras to automatically annotate each other's the visual semantics of social configurations. We leverage two learning signals uniquely embedded in first person videos. Individually, a first person video records the visual semantics of a spatial and social layout around a person that allows associating with past similar situations. Collectively, first person videos follow joint attention that can link the individuals to a group. We learn the egocentric visual semantics of group movements using a Siamese neural network to retrieve future trajectories. We consolidate the retrieved trajectories from all players by maximizing a measure of social compatibility [...] -the gaze alignment towards joint attention predicted by their social formation, where the dynamics of joint attention is learned by a long-term recurrent convolutional network. This allows us to characterize which social configuration is more plausible and predict future group trajectories...|$|R
500|$|When {{the weekend}} of 6–7 December arrived, all of the Pacific Fleet's battleships were in port for the weekend {{for the first time}} since 4 July. Normally they took turns {{spending}} time in port— six would be out with Vice Admiral William S.

However, because Halsey could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the slow battleships with his fast carriers on his dash to reinforce Wake Island's Marine detachment with fighters and because it was Pye's turn to rest in port and the harbor was where it was considered safe, none of the battleships were sailing on that morning.

500|$|Academic archaeologists criticised Jones' work at Mucking {{as one of}} {{the prime}} {{examples}} of [...] "excavation without publication". They argued that since the primary aim of any archaeological excavation is [...] "preservation by record", failing to publish the results amounted to destroying the archaeology without purpose, and that it was irresponsible to excavate large areas without the means to properly process and disseminate the results. Indeed, in thirteen years of continuous excavation at Mucking, Jones only published a single, short paper on the results of her trial excavations in 1965. When the project was completed in 1978, despite the huge volume of material that had been recovered, very little had been analysed and none had been published. Ultimately, the final publication of Mucking was undertaken by others (English Heritage and the Cambridge Archaeological Unit), the first volume of which did not appear until 2015, fourteen years after Jones' death. Jones argued that as the site was being constantly destroyed by the gravel extraction on the site, she could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> time out of the year for post-excavation, nor did she have the funding to complete it.|$|E
500|$|Oregon {{served for}} a short time with the Pacific Station before being ordered on a voyage around South America to the East Coast in March 1898 in {{preparation}} for war with Spain. She departed from San Francisco on 19 March, and reached Jupiter Inlet on 24 May, stopping several times for additional coal on the way. A journey of over 14,000 nautical miles was completed in 66 days, which was considered a remarkable achievement at the time. The Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships describes the effect of the journey on the American public and government as follows: [...] "On one hand the feat had demonstrated the many capabilities of a heavy battleship in all conditions of wind and sea. On the other it swept away all opposition for the construction of the Panama Canal, for it was then made clear that the country could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> two months to send warships from one coast to the other each time an emergency arose." [...] After completing her journey, Oregon was ordered to join the blockade at Santiago as part of the North Atlantic Squadron under Rear Admiral Sampson. She took part in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, where she and the cruiser [...] were the only ships fast enough to chase down the Spanish cruiser Cristobal Colon, forcing its surrender. Around this time, she received the nickname [...] "Bulldog of the Navy", most likely because of her high bow wave—known as [...] "having a bone in her teeth" [...] in nautical slang—and perseverance during the cruise around South America and the battle of Santiago.|$|E
