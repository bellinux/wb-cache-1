40|$|Program {{autotuning}} {{has been}} shown to achieve better or more portable performance in a number of domains. How-ever, <b>autotuners</b> themselves are rarely portable between projects, for a number of reasons: using a domain-informed search space representation is critical to achieving good re-sults; search spaces can be intractably large and require ad-vanced machine learning techniques; and the landscape of search spaces can vary greatly between different problems, sometimes requiring domain specific search techniques to explore efficiently. This paper introduces OpenTuner, a new open source framework for building domain-specific multi-objective pro-gram <b>autotuners.</b> OpenTuner supports fully-customizable configuration representations, an extensible technique rep-resentation to allow for domain-specific techniques, and an easy to use interface for communicating with the program to be autotuned. A key capability inside OpenTuner is the use of ensembles of disparate search techniques simultaneously; techniques that perform well will dynamically be allocated a larger proportion of tests. We demonstrate the efficacy and generality of OpenTuner by building <b>autotuners</b> for 6 dis-tinct projects and 14 total benchmarks, showing speedups over prior techniques of these projects of up to 2. 8 × with little programmer effort.

40|$|AbstractEmpirical {{performance}} optimization {{of computer}} codes using <b>autotuners</b> has received significant attention in recent years. Given the increased complexity of computer architectures and scientific codes, evaluating all possible code variants is prohibitively expensive {{for all but}} the simplest kernels. One way for <b>autotuners</b> to overcome this hurdle is through use of a search algorithm that finds high-performing code variants while examining relatively few variants. In this paper we examine the search problem in autotuning from a mathematical optimization perspective. As an illustration of the power and limitations of this optimization, we conduct an experimental study of several optimization algorithms on a number of linear algebra kernel codes. We find that the algorithms considered obtain performance gains similar to the optimal ones found by complete enumeration or by large random searches but in {{a tiny fraction of the}} computation time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Although a {{wide range}} of control {{algorithms}} are available, PID controllers are still the most widely used type. Even control engineers who have a good knowledge of advanced control algorithms prefer PID controllers when they are asked to design the control circuit for a new device. This is because of their price and because of the simplicity and reliability of the control algorithm. The PID control algorithm enables anyone with a basic knowledge of mathematics to gain some idea of what happens inside the controller during the control process, how the manipulated value is computed and its dependence on the control error. The main disadvantage of standard PID type controllers is the absence of autotuning features. Implementation of such controllers requires time-consuming tuning, and very often the presence of expensive experts. Therefore, there is quite strong pressure to equip new PID controllers with simple <b>autotuners.</b> Recently, tuners based on relay experiments have become popular. However, the use of <b>autotuners</b> of this kind requires the control process to be stopped temporarily during the relay experiment. For these reasons, even controllers equipped with these autotuning facilities are used without any tuning, sometimes even with the factory presetting. This unsatisfactory situation has motivated us to develop a new frequency response based autotuning algorithm that does not use any model of the controlled plant and enables the controller parameters to be changed without the necessity to break the control process...|$|R

40|$|Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) {{controllers}} {{are very}} common in the process industry. In a regular factory there may be {{hundreds or thousands of}} them in use. Each of these controllers needs to be tuned, and even though the PID controller is simple, tuning the controllers still requires several hours of work and adequate knowledge in order to achieve a desired performance. Because of that, many of the operating PID controllers today are poorly tuned or even running in manual mode. Methods for tuning the controllers in an automated fashion are therefore highly beneficial, and the relay <b>autotuner,</b> that was introduced on the market in the 1980 ’s, has been listed {{as one of the great}} success stories of control. The technology development since the 1980 ’s, both concerning PID control and available computing power, gives opportunities for improvements of the <b>autotuner.</b> In this thesis three new autotuners are presented. They are all based on asymmetric relay feedback tests, providing process excitation at the frequency intervals relevant for PID control. One of the proposed autotuners is similar to the classic relay <b>autotuner,</b> but provides low-order models from which the controllers are tuned by simple formulas. The second <b>autotuner</b> uses the data from a very short relay test as input to an optimization method. This method provides more accurate model estimations, but to the cost of more omputing. The controller is then tuned by another optimization method, using the estimated model as input. The principle of the third <b>autotuner</b> is similar to the second one, but it is used to tune multivariable PID controllers for interacting processes. In this case a relay feedback experiment is performed on all loops simultaneously, and the data is used to identify the process transfer function matrix. All of the proposed autotuners strive to be user-friendly and practically applicable. Evaluation of the three autotuning strategies are done both through simulation examples and on experimental processes. The developed autotuners are also compared to commercially available ones, and the study shows that an upgrade of the industry standard to the newly available autotuners will yield a significant performance improvement...|$|E

The PetaBricks compiler and <b>autotuner</b> is not only able to compose a complex program using fine-grained algorithmic choices but also find the right choice for many other parameters including data distribution, parallelization and blocking. We re-examine classic numerical algorithms with PetaBricks, and show that the PetaBricks <b>autotuner</b> produces nontrivial optimal algorithms {{that are difficult to}} reproduce otherwise.

Julia is a new high-level programming language that aims at achieving performance comparable to traditional compiled languages, while remaining easy to program and offering flexible parallelism without extensive effort. We describe a problem in large-scale terrain data analysis which motivates the use of Julia. We perform classical filtering techniques to study the terrain profiles and propose a measure based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to quantify terrain surface roughness.

40|$|Abstract: The {{accuracy}} of the Ziegler-Nichols tuning formula is reviewed {{in the context of}} PID and PI autotuning. For PID autotuning, it will be shown that, for excessive overshoot in the set-point response, set-point weighting can reduce the overshoot to specified values, and the original Ziegler-Nichols tuning formula can be retained. It will also be shown that set-point weighting is superior to the conventional solution of reducing large overshoot by gain detuning or set-point fil-tering. However, for excessive set-point under-shoot, the tuning formula will have to be modified. For PI autotuning, it will be shown that the Ziegler-Nichols tuning formula is inadequate and has to be completely revised. The application of set-point weighting and the modification of the tuning formula can be based simply on the know-ledge of the normalised gain or normalised dead-time of the process. These heuristic refinements, when incorporated, will give appreciable improve-ment in the performance of <b>autotuners.</b> ...|$|R

SiblingRivalry improves on INCREA by optimizing online during a program's execution, dynamically adapting to changes in hardware and the operating system. Continuous adaptation is achieved through racing, where half of available resources are devoted to always-on learning.
