2500|$|A {{motor-generator}} set, or {{the similar}} rotary converter, is not strictly a rectifier {{as it does}} not actually rectify current, but rather generates DC from an AC source. In an [...] "M-G set", the shaft of an AC motor is mechanically coupled {{to that of a}} DC generator. The DC generator produces multiphase alternating currents in its <b>armature</b> <b>windings,</b> which a commutator on the armature shaft converts into a direct current output; or a homopolar generator produces a direct current without the need for a commutator. M-G sets are useful for producing DC for railway traction motors, industrial motors and other high-current applications, and were common in many high-power D.C. uses (for example, carbon-arc lamp projectors for outdoor theaters) before high-power semiconductors became widely available.|$|E
2500|$|Since the <b>armature</b> <b>windings</b> of a direct-current or {{universal}} motor are moving through a magnetic field, {{they have a}} voltage induced in them. This voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called [...] "back electromotive force (emf)". The voltage {{is proportional to the}} running speed of the motor. The back emf of the motor, plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance and brushes, must equal the voltage at the brushes. This provides the fundamental mechanism of speed regulation in a DC motor. If the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; a lower back emf results, and more current is drawn from the supply. This increased current provides the additional torque to balance the new load.|$|E
50|$|Braking {{effort is}} {{proportional}} to the product of the magnetic strength of the field windings, multiplied by that of the <b>armature</b> <b>windings.</b>|$|E
5000|$|If {{the shaft}} of a DC motor is turned by an {{external}} force, the motor will act like a generator and produce an Electromotive force (EMF). During normal operation, the spinning of the motor produces a voltage, known as the counter-EMF (CEMF) or back EMF, because it opposes the applied voltage on the motor. The back EMF {{is the reason that}} the motor when free-running {{does not appear to have}} the same low electrical resistance as the wire contained in its winding. This is the same EMF that is produced when the motor is used as a generator (for example when an electrical load, such as a light bulb, is placed across the terminals of the motor and the motor shaft is driven with an external torque). Therefore, the total voltage drop across a motor consists of the CEMF voltage drop, and the parasitic voltage drop resulting from the internal resistance of the <b>armature's</b> <b>windings.</b> The current through a motor is given by the following equation: ...|$|R
50|$|The French {{engineer}} Auguste de Méritens (1834-1898) developed magnetos further {{for this}} purpose. His innovation was {{to replace the}} rotor coils previously wound on individual bobbins, with a 'ring wound' <b>armature.</b> These <b>windings</b> were placed on a segmented iron core, similar to a Gramme ring, so as to form a single continuous hoop. This gave a more even output current, which was still more advantageous for arc lamps.|$|R
50|$|The Thunderjet could {{outperform}} contemporary inlines {{primarily because}} the vertical-shaft layout allowed the bulky motor magnets to be mounted {{to the front}} and rear, which left the full width of the chassis for the <b>armature</b> and <b>windings.</b> Inline motors require side-mounted magnets, limiting the size of both armature and magnets. The extra torque of the pancake motor's oversized armature more than made up for the friction losses in its complex power train.|$|R

50|$|A Ward Leonard drive can {{be viewed}} as a {{high-power}} amplifier in the multi-kilowatt range, built from rotating electrical machinery. Where the 'prime mover' is electrical, a Ward Leonard drive unit consists of a motor and generator with shafts coupled together. The prime mover, which turns at a constant speed, may be AC or DC powered. The generator is a DC generator, with field windings and <b>armature</b> <b>windings.</b> The input to the amplifier is applied to the field windings, and the higher power output comes from the <b>armature</b> <b>windings.</b> (See Excitation (magnetic)#Amplifier principle for how a generator can act as an amplifier.) The amplifier output is usually connected to a second motor, which moves the load, such as an elevator. With this arrangement, small changes in current applied to the input, and thus the generator field, result in large changes in the output, allowing smooth speed control.|$|E
50|$|Doubly-fed {{electric}} {{machines are}} electric motors or electric generators where both the field magnet windings and <b>armature</b> <b>windings</b> are separately connected to equipment outside the machine. By feeding adjustable frequency AC {{power to the}} field windings, the magnetic field {{can be made to}} rotate, allowing variation in motor or generator speed. This is useful, for instance, for generators used in wind turbines.|$|E
50|$|In a brushed DC motor {{the field}} is static but the {{armature}} current must be commutated, so as to continually rotate. This is done by supplying the <b>armature</b> <b>windings</b> on the rotor through a commutator, a combination of rotating slip ring and switches. AC induction motors also use field coils on the stator, the current on the rotor being supplied by induction in a squirrel cage.|$|E

50|$|A series DC motor {{connects the}} <b>armature</b> and field <b>windings</b> {{in series with}} a common D.C. power source. The motor speed varies as a {{non-linear}} function of load torque and armature current; current is common to both the stator and rotor yielding current squared (I^2) behavior. A series motor has very high starting torque and is commonly used for starting high inertia loads, such as trains, elevators or hoists. This speed/torque characteristic is useful in applications such as dragline excavators, where the digging tool moves rapidly when unloaded but slowly when carrying a heavy load.|$|R

50|$|Shaft voltage {{occurs in}} {{electric}} motors and generators due to leakage, induction, or capacitive coupling with the windings of the motor. It {{can occur in}} motors powered by variable-frequency drives, as often used in heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration systems. DC machines may have leakage current from the <b>armature</b> <b>windings</b> that energizes the shaft. Currents due to shaft voltage causes deterioration of motor bearings, but can be prevented with a grounding brush on the shaft, grounding of the motor frame, insulation of the bearing supports, or shielding.|$|E
50|$|After dynamos and motors {{were found}} to allow easy {{conversion}} {{back and forth between}} mechanical or electrical power, they were combined in devices called rotary converters, rotating machines whose purpose was not to provide mechanical power to loads but to convert one type of electric current into another, for example DC into AC. They were multi-field single-rotor devices with two or more sets of rotating contacts (either commutators or sliprings, as required), one to provide power to one set of <b>armature</b> <b>windings</b> to turn the device, and one or more attached to other windings to produce the output current.|$|E
50|$|A {{compound}} DC motor {{connects the}} <b>armature</b> and fields <b>windings</b> in a shunt {{and a series}} combination to give it characteristics of both a shunt and a series DC motor. This motor is used when both a high starting torque and good speed regulation is needed. The motor can be connected in two arrangements: cumulatively or differentially. Cumulative compound motors connect the series field to aid the shunt field, which provides higher starting torque but less speed regulation. Differential compound DC motors have good speed regulation and are typically operated at constant speed.|$|R

50|$|The rotor {{is a large}} magnet with poles {{constructed}} of steel lamination projecting out of the rotor’s core. The poles are supplied by direct current or magnetized by permanent magnets. The armature with a three-phase winding is attached to three slip rings with brushes riding on them and mounted on the shaft. The field winding is wound on the rotor which produces the magnetic field and the armature winding is on the stator where voltage is induced. Direct current (DC), from an external exciter or from a diode bridge mounted on the rotor shaft, produces a magnetic field and energizes the rotating field windings and alternating current energizes the <b>armature</b> <b>windings</b> simultaneously.|$|E
5000|$|Since an {{armature}} {{is wound}} with coils of wire, {{a magnetic field}} is {{set up in the}} armature whenever a current flows in the coils. This field is at right angles to the generator field, and is called cross magnetization of the armature. The effect of the armature field is to distort the generator field and shift the neutral plane. The neutral plane is the position where the <b>armature</b> <b>windings</b> are moving parallel to the magnetic flux lines, that is why an axis lying in this plane is called as magnetic neutral axis (MNA). This effect is known as armature reaction and is proportional to the current flowing in the armature coils.|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} decades, superconducting {{electrical}} machines {{have become more}} suitable to replace conventional iron based designs, because of their lower weight and higher torque density.

Smaller brushless alternators may look like one unit but the two parts are readily identifiable on the large versions. The larger of the two sections is the main alternator and the smaller one is the exciter. The exciter has stationary field coils and a rotating armature (power coils). The main alternator uses the opposite configuration with a rotating field and stationary armature. A bridge rectifier, called the rotating rectifier assembly, is mounted on the rotor. Neither brushes nor slip rings are used, which reduces the number of wearing parts. The main alternator has a rotating field as described above and a stationary <b>armature</b> (power generation <b>windings).</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{traction}} motors are {{mounted on the}} truck frames (see above), which protects them from impact when rolling over rail joints and reduces the train's unsprung weight. The first ER2s had the same DK-106B {{traction motors}} as the ER1; these were DC series motors (the armature and field windings were connected in series, as is normal for variable-speed DC motors) with 4 main and 4 auxiliary poles and wavy <b>armature</b> <b>windings.</b> The motor's clamp voltage was 1500 V, and the insulation was designed for 3000 V (which gave a 2-fold safety margin). Unlike locomotive traction motors, these motors normally operated in weak field, with maximum field strength used only during acceleration. The motors are self-cooling (the cooling fan is fixed on the motor's output shaft); the cooling air is taken in through air intakes above the passenger doors.|$|E
