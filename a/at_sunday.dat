He read the Bible once a year every year, taught <b>at</b> <b>Sunday</b> school, and {{recruited}} missionaries. He said he could see auras around people, spoke to angels, and heard voices of departed relatives. In his early years, he agonized over whether these psychic abilities were spiritually delivered from the highest source.|$|E

25|$|The Breton {{people are}} {{predominantly}} {{members of the}} Catholic Church, with minorities in the Reformed Church of France and non-religious people.

This includes the Tro Breizh, which takes place in the shrines of the seven founding saints of Breton Christianity. The Christian tradition is widely respected by both believers and nonbelievers, who see it as a symbol of Breton heritage and culture.|$|E

25|$|The ACNA is a conciliar {{church where}} both clergy and laity {{participate}} in church governance. Every five years, between 250 and 300 diocesan delegates meet {{as a representative}} body called the Provincial Assembly. Each diocese is represented by its bishop, two clergy delegates, and two lay delegates. In addition, a diocese receives one additional clergy delegate and one additional lay delegate for every 1,000 constituents, calculated by average attendance <b>at</b> <b>Sunday</b> church services. Dioceses also send youth representatives {{between the ages of}} 16 and 26, and these representatives have full voting rights. The Provincial Assembly must approve all constitutional amendments and new canons before they go into effect. Other duties of the assembly include deliberating on church affairs and making recommendations to the provincial governing bodies on such matters.|$|E
25|$|Ken Barrington met {{his future}} wife Ann Cozens at a dance in Reading in 1952. She was a {{secretary}} for the local Education Department, taught <b>at</b> <b>Sunday</b> School and played netball. He proposed to her on a train to Reading and her father agreed to the marriage if they saved £500. As a result, they married on 6 March 1954 and honeymooned in Devon until Ken was called up for the Territorial Army at Salisbury. They remained happily married for 27 years until his death. As first-class cricketers rarely had employment in the winter Barrington worked for British Rail (painting Oxford station), a firm of solicitors {{and moved on to}} selling perfumes and carpets. They first lived with Ann's parents, but in 1956 bought their own house in Mitcham in Surrey near the Oval, where he found work nearby with a firm of accountants and Ann at a travel agents.|$|E

500|$|In December 2010 Wells Cathedral Choir {{was rated}} by Gramophone {{magazine}} as [...] "the highest ranking choir {{with children in}} the world". It continues to provide music for the liturgy <b>at</b> <b>Sunday</b> and weekday services.

Major choral works are also performed during the year, such as the oratorio Elijah by Felix Mendelssohn, conducted by Walker and accompanied by guest organist Frederick Swann, and Johann Sebastian Bach's cantata, God's time is always the very best time ("Actus Tragicus", BWV106), in the 2008–2009 season. The choir's May, 2009, performance of Elijah has since been released on CD.|$|E
500|$|While {{her husband}} has {{provoked}} a variety of critical responses, some negative; assessments of Hewson have generally been favourable, characterising her as down-to-earth. She views herself as [...] "not a typical rock star wife". Their marriage has been {{considered one of the}} most long-lived and stable in the entertainment world. She does have to deal with the psychological effects of her husband coming off tour and readjusting to domestic life. After the extended 1992–1993 Zoo TV Tour, full of sensory overloads and alternate stage personae for Bono, the couple began a practice of hosting Sunday lunches at home, to establish a sense of regular, ordinary activities. The family became fixtures <b>at</b> <b>Sunday</b> services in Killiney as well, with a bond of Christianity still existing between the couple. She has stated, [...] "I've no desire to be a star," [...] seeing the effect intense public attention has had on both her husband and on Adi Roche.|$|E

2500|$|John Bosco {{records that}} Dominic {{spent a lot}} of time with his friends, {{encouraging}} them in their devotions, discouraging those with a habit of swearing, and teaching Catechism <b>at</b> <b>Sunday</b> School. Bosco also records that he would encourage his friends to make frequent use of the sacrament of confession and [...] take Communion regularly, even giving them encouragement and advice in spiritual practices during games. John Bosco makes particular mention of two of Dominic's friends, Camillo Gavio of Tortona, and John Massaglia of Marmorito.

2500|$|By 1900 about 85% of {{the people}} were {{classified}} as Protestants, 10% as Roman Catholics and 5% as Jews. [...] Berlin's middle and upper classes were generally devout Protestants. The working classes increasingly became secularized. When workers moved to Berlin the Protestants among them largely abandoned the religious practices of their old villages. The labor unions promoted anticlericalism, and denounced the Protestant churches as aloof from {{the needs of the}} working class. However, the Catholic workers remained somewhat closer to their traditional churches, which featured liturgies that were more appealing to workers than worthy intellectual sermons at the Protestant churches. [...] Adult attendance <b>at</b> <b>Sunday</b> church services in the early 20th century was 6% in Berlin, compared to 22% in London and 37% in New York.|$|E

He celebrated the claim that Israel is a country in the Middle East where Christians are not persecuted and said of his visit to Israel in 2007: [...] "As a Christian, I have always felt a very close affinity with the Holy Land. It was a delight to see places [...] that I had learned about during my own childhood <b>at</b> <b>Sunday</b> school and {{in the pages of the}} scriptures we were encouraged to read." [...] He went on to draw a parallel between the size and verdancy of Israel and that of his own [...] "homeland", Wales.|$|E
