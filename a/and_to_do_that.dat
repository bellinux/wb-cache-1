500|$|Inhabitants of {{the ghetto}} {{referred}} to Gens derisively as [...] "King Jacob the First". The historian Lucy Dawidowicz describes {{him as one of}} a group of [...] "strong, even dictatorial" [...] leaders who were [...] "the policy and decision makers in their ghettos, the strategical thinkers on the ghetto's possibilities for survival". Gens thought that labor would provide a way for the inhabitants to survive. Along with several other ghetto leaders, he hoped to preserve some {{of the ghetto}} inhabitants and outlast the Nazi occupation. Historian Michael Marrus describes Gens' leadership style as [...] "intensely authoritarian" [...] and Marrus argues that Gens came to [...] "believe that [...] alone could save a portion of the ghetto inmates". This belief has made Gens a controversial figure both at the time and to this day. He sought to save at least some of the population by working for the Germans <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> he relied on the police force. As part of his efforts to secure support, he held a [...] "political club" [...] of sorts in his home, bringing together some of the community leaders for colloquia to discuss Jewish history, recent events, and the fate of the Jews.|$|E
500|$|The cold winters drove Marquis to {{consider}} yet another change of career (Whitehall {{is at an}} elevation of 4360ft); he applied to the United States Veteran's Bureau. Meanwhile, he continued writing. He expanded his Indian diary into {{a book on the}} Cheyenne; he also wrote short stories and an article on [...] "Reviewing the Story of Custer's Last Battle", the first of his many publications on this subject. In April 1923, he moved to Alberton, where he continued to practice medicine, and published a short story [...] "Buffalo Heart, Indian Policeman", printed in The Youth's Companion, a leading literary magazine. In June, this success, and the better climate in Alberton, led him to turn down a job offer from the Veteran's Bureau and put most of his effort into work on his Cheyenne book. In May 1924 he had a second story, [...] "The Guest of the Tribe", published in The Youth's Companion. However, Marquis was never really comfortable writing fiction. What he really {{wanted to do was to}} write non-fiction about the Custer battle, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> he needed to be nearer to the scene. The opportunity came in June 1925 when the agency physician for the Crow Reservation suggested to him that there was room for another physician to set up practice there. In August, he set up a medical practice in Lodge Grass on the Crow Reservation.|$|E

500|$|As {{mayor of}} Newark, New Jersey, he [...] "drew {{criticism}} from liberal allies for embracing charter schools and voucher programs advocated by libertarians." [...] "He also championed “enterprise zones,” a free-market approach to solving urban blight credited {{to the late}} Jack Kemp, a hard-core supply-sider and occasional Republican presidential contender who helped raise money for Booker’s first mayoral campaign." [...] Besides social media advances, Booker {{wants to see the}} rest of the tech sector reach its fullest potential, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> he thinks the U.S. government needs to ease up on regulations. “We’re not moving at the speed of innovation due to regulations,” he said, adding that because of this, key industries are leaving the U.S. to work on projects in other countries where the rules aren’t as strict. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration has hindered drone innovation to the point where drone companies are leaving the U.S. to test and build in Europe. “We’re being left behind on everything from next-generation nuclear energy to driverless cars and biologics,” Booker said, “and we cannot get left behind.” He supports long-term deficit reduction efforts to ensure economic prosperity, Cap and Trade taxation to combat climate change, and increased funding for education. He supports ending the War on Drugs. Daniel J. Mitchell of the Cato Institute identities Booker as having libertarian views in opposition to the War on Drugs. Booker supports abortion rights and affirmative action.|$|E
500|$|On December 30, 2004, {{following}} the island being moved in [...] "There's No Place Like Home", {{the survivors of}} Oceanic Flight 815, the freighter team, and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) begin to erratically jump through time - something Faraday likens to standing on a skipping record - [...] while the Others are unaffected. The first jump takes them {{to the day when}} the Beechcraft carrying Mr. Eko's brother crashes onto the island. John Locke is shot in the leg by Ethan Rom (William Mapother), who has not yet met him and therefore does not recognize him. Meanwhile, James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway), Juliet and the freighter team head to the [...] in order to determine when they are. A second jump brings the group forward in time to after the destruction of the station, while Locke is approached by Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who recognizes Locke and treats his wound. He informs Locke that they will be strangers at their next meeting, and explains {{that the only way to}} stop the erratic movements through time is to bring back everyone who has left the island, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> Locke will have to die. Another jump brings them to the past, and they find that the Swan station is now intact. Sawyer tries to contact Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), who is inside, but Daniel asserts that the past can not be changed, and since Desmond did not know Sawyer already when they first met, Sawyer cannot be successful. No one answers, and everyone heads back to the beach. Daniel stays behind and knocks again, and Desmond emerges dressed in a hazmat suit, thus belying Daniel's original assertion. Daniel tells him that if Desmond's future self and the survivors of 815 make it off the island on the helicopter then he should go to Oxford University and find Daniel's mother, in order to help the survivors. Another jump occurs just before Daniel can give his mother's name.|$|E

[...] The word [...] "employee" [...] had hitherto always been taken to mean someone who is obviously not in business on his own account (i.e. not [...] "self employed"), but recognised as subordinate labour, economically dependent on the employer. However, Alexander Irvine QC argued that the waiters had no [...] "mutuality of obligation" [...] with the employer: they were not bound to accept work engagements when they were called up, and the employer was under no obligation to call them up. They could leave, or be fired, at will. Sir John Donaldson accepted this argument and deemed the waiters to fall outside of the scope of unfair dismissal legislation.|$|E

During his time as police commissioner he made five arrests, including one involving two ex-convicts—one a paroled killer, wanted for a carjacking at gunpoint in Virginia—for allegedly driving a stolen van in Harlem.
