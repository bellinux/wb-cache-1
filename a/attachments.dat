The organization of an internal working model is generally seen as leading to more stable <b>attachments</b> in those who develop such a model, rather than those who rely more on the individual's state of mind alone in forming new <b>attachments.</b>|$|E
5|$|Early in the 20th century, {{paleontologist}} R. S. Lull {{proposed that}} the frills of ceratopsian dinosaurs acted as anchor points for their jaw muscles.

5|$|Four {{different}} <b>attachment</b> classifications {{have been}} identified in children: secure <b>attachment,</b> anxious-ambivalent <b>attachment,</b> anxious-avoidant <b>attachment,</b> and disorganized <b>attachment.</b> Secure <b>attachment</b> is when children feel they can rely on their caregivers to attend to their needs of proximity, emotional support and protection. It is considered to be the best <b>attachment</b> style. Anxious-ambivalent <b>attachment</b> is when the infant feels separation anxiety when separated from the caregiver and does not feel reassured when the caregiver returns to the infant. Anxious-avoidant <b>attachment</b> is when the infant avoids their parents. Disorganized <b>attachment</b> is when {{there is a lack of}} <b>attachment</b> behavior.|$|R

Importantly, <b>attachment</b> orientation did not predict baseline levels of face-rubbing gesturing; demonstrating that <b>attachment</b> orientation had an effect on mimicry rather than overall behavior expression. <b>Attachment</b> anxiety was positively related to attraction to the confederate such that those higher in <b>attachment</b> anxiety rated the confederate as more attractive.

5|$|The {{pathological}} {{absence of}} a discriminatory or selective attachment needs to be differentiated from the existence of <b>attachments</b> with either typical or somewhat atypical behavior patterns, known as styles or patterns. There are four attachment styles ascertained and used within developmental attachment research. These are known as secure, anxious-ambivalent, anxious-avoidant, (all organized) and disorganized. The latter three are characterised as insecure. These are assessed using the Strange Situation Procedure, designed to assess the quality of <b>attachments</b> rather than whether an attachment exists at all.|$|E

25|$|<b>Attachment</b> {{theory has}} led to a new {{understanding}} of child development. Children develop different patterns of <b>attachment</b> based on experiences and interactions with their caregivers at a young age. Four different <b>attachment</b> classifications have been identified in children: secure <b>attachment,</b> anxious-ambivalent <b>attachment,</b> anxious-avoidant <b>attachment,</b> and disorganized <b>attachment.</b> <b>Attachment</b> theory has become the dominant theory used today in the study of infant and toddler behavior and in the fields of infant mental health, treatment of children, and related fields.|$|R
40|$|<b>Attachment</b> theory predicts cross-contextual {{stability}} of <b>attachment</b> representations, but research findings are rather mixed. Recently, {{it has been}} suggested that these mixed findings reflect the existence of both state and trait <b>attachment</b> components. The development of the State Adult <b>Attachment</b> Measure (SAAM) has enabled an investigation of this hypothesis. The current study aimed to evaluate the extent to which the SAAM is a useful instrument for studying such state <b>attachment</b> hypotheses. For this purpose, a two-week longitudinal study investigated whether the manipulation of the temporal accessibility of different <b>attachment</b> contents activates different within-person <b>attachment</b> representations. The impact of <b>attachment</b> primes before re-administering the SAAM was investigated in 268 participants. Results showed that the SAAM was meaningfully related to evaluations of self and <b>attachment</b> figures. Moreover, activation of different <b>attachment</b> contexts influenced state <b>attachment</b> towards partners as primary <b>attachment</b> figures. The results provide support for the SAAM as a measure of state <b>attachment</b> towards partners, but data on parent <b>attachment</b> were less straightforward. In all, the current study provided support for contemporary models of <b>attachment</b> as comprising both trait-like stability and context-dependent variability in <b>attachment</b> state...|$|R
50|$|<b>Attachment</b> {{in adults}} is {{commonly}} measured using the Adult <b>Attachment</b> Interview, the Adult <b>Attachment</b> Projective Picture System, and self-report questionnaires.

Adult <b>attachment</b> style {{is thought to}} be similar to childhood <b>attachment</b> patterns. There is some research that shows a link between childhood <b>attachment</b> patterns and <b>attachment</b> personality dimensions with romantic partners, but correlations are mild to moderate. The most common approach to defining <b>attachment</b> style is a two-dimension approach in defining <b>attachment</b> style. One dimension deals with anxiety about the relationship, and the other dimension dealing with avoidance in the relationship. Another approach defines four adult <b>attachment</b> style categories: secure, preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant, and fearful-avoidant.|$|R

40|$|Parent-child <b>attachment</b> {{refers to}} the {{emotional}} bond that forms between parent and child, which has great influences on the child’s interpersonal development. Present study applied both correlation method and secure <b>attachment</b> memory activation method to investigate the “gender relation effects” of parent-child <b>attachment’s</b> influences on college students’ close relationships, general <b>attachment</b> representation, and emotion and social loneliness. The basic hypotheses on “gender relation” were set as: “same-sex” parent-child <b>attachment</b> has more influences on college students’ “same-sex” interpersonal relationships, while “opposite-sex” parent-child <b>attachment</b> has more influences on college students’ “opposite-sex” interpersonal relationships. Major findings includes: 1. 	There was weak correlation of <b>attachment</b> security between father-child and mother-child relationships. The findings indicated that, among college students, the security of “opposite-sex” parent-child <b>attachment</b> representation is higher to some extent than that of “same-sex” parent-child <b>attachment</b> representation. 2. 	There were significant correlations between parent-child <b>attachment</b> and college students’ <b>attachment</b> anxiety in close relationships. Major findings indicated that “opposite-sex” parent-child <b>attachment</b> security negatively predicts college students’ <b>attachment</b> anxiety in both “same-sex” and “opposite-sex” close relationships. 3. 	Gender relation effects were significant in the correlations between parent-child <b>attachment</b> and college students’ level of avoidant <b>attachment</b> representation. “Same-sex” parent-child <b>attachment</b> security positively predicted avoidant <b>attachment</b> level in college students’ “same-sex” close relationships, while “opposite-sex” parent-child <b>attachment</b> security positively predicted avoidant <b>attachment</b> level in “opposite-sex” close relationships. 4. 	Parent-child <b>attachment</b> security memory activation had significant influences on college students’ general <b>attachment</b> representation, in which gender relation effects indicated that: the memory activation of father-child <b>attachment</b> security significantly increases participants’ security of self-model in general <b>attachment</b> representation to “male others”; while the memory activation of mother-child <b>attachment</b> security significantly increase participants’ security of others-model in general <b>attachment</b> representation to “female others”. 5. 	For male college students, father-son <b>attachment</b> security negatively predicted their emotion and social loneliness. For female college students, father-daughter <b>attachment</b> security negatively predicted their emotion loneliness, while mother-daughter <b>attachment</b> security negatively predicted their social loneliness. <b>Attachment</b> security memory activation had significant influences on college students’ social loneliness, in which gender relation effects was confirmed in that only father-child <b>attachment</b> security memory activation significantly decreased male participants’ level of social loneliness. The results indicated that gender relation effects are significant in the influences of parent-child <b>attachment</b> on college students’ interpersonal relationship representations, especially when the level of avoidant of <b>attachment</b> in college students’ close relationships was predicted by parent-child <b>attachment</b> representation, and when the memory activation of parent-child <b>attachment</b> influenced college students’ general <b>attachment</b> representation. The present study confirmed to some extent that gender relation consistency exists in <b>attachment</b> representations among different interpersonal relations, {{and serves as a}} new model for analysis of gender differences in the research fields. In the present study, however, gender relation effects were not confirmed in all the interpersonal relationship representations, which indicated the complexity in the problems of gender differences in the research fields of close relationships. 亲子依恋是指父母与子女之间持续而富有意义的情感纽带，对个体人际关系发展具有重要的影响。本研究分别采用相关研究方法和依恋安全记忆激活实验方法，从大学生亲子依恋表征本身的性别差异出发，以不同关系对象依恋表征中的“性别关系”为核心，重点考察了亲子依恋对大学生亲密关系表征、一般依恋表征以及因人际关系缺乏产生的感情和社会孤独影响的性别差异问题。本研究围绕“性别关系效应”的基本假设是：大学生人际交往中的“同性”关系表征更多受到“同性”亲子依恋的影响；而“异性”关系表征更多受到“异性”亲子依恋的影响。主要研究发现可以概括为以下几个方面： 1. 	在大学生的亲子依恋表征上，分别来自父亲和母亲的依恋表征为弱相关；在子代性别差异上，“父子”依恋安全性显著低于“父女”依恋安全性；在亲代性别差异上，“父子”依恋安全性显著低于“母子”依恋安全性；结果在一定程度上体现为“异性关系”的亲子依恋安全性高于“同性关系”。 2. 	亲子依恋表征与大学生亲密关系依恋焦虑的相关分析结果显示，“异性关系”的亲子依恋表征对大学生亲密关系（包括同性和异性亲密关系）依恋焦虑具有显著的预测作用。 3. 	在亲子依恋表征对大学生亲密关系（包括同性和异性亲密关系）依恋回避的预测作用上显示出明显的“性别关系效应”：“同性关系”的亲子依恋安全性越低，则意味着在“同性关系”的朋友（伙伴）交往中依恋回避倾向越明显；“异性关系”的亲子依恋安全性越低，则意味着在“异性关系”的亲密交往中回避倾向越明显。 	 4. 	亲子依恋安全记忆激活对大学生一般依恋表征影响的“性别关系效应”显著：来自父亲（而不是母亲）的依恋安全记忆激活能够显著提高大学生对“一般男性”依恋表征的自我模型，而来自母亲（而不是父亲）的依恋安全记忆激活能够显著提高大学生对“一般女性”依恋表征的他人模型。 	 5. 	来自父亲（而不是母亲）的依恋表征能够显著预测男性大学生因缺乏异性亲密关系而产生的感情孤独，同时显著预测男性大学生因缺乏同伴友谊而产生的社会孤独。对女性大学生而言，来自父亲（而不是母亲）的依恋表征能够显著预测女性大学生的感情孤独，来自母亲（而不是父亲）的依恋表征能够显著预测她们的社会孤独。来自父亲（而不是母亲）的依恋安全记忆激活能够显著降低男性大学生的社会孤独水平。 	上述结果表明，在亲子依恋对大学生人际关系表征的影响上，“性别关系效应”是明显存在的，主要表现在亲子依恋表征对大学生亲密关系“回避”倾向的预测作用以及亲子依恋记忆激活对大学生一般依恋表征的影响这两个方面；在亲子依恋对大学生因人际关系缺乏而产生的感情和社会孤独的影响上，“性别关系效应”也有一定的体现。这在一定程度上揭示了不同关系对象依恋表征之间的内在一致性，并为亲密关系研究领域中针对性别差异问题的分析提供了一个比较有效的分析模型。但研究同时也发现，“性别关系效应”并没有在所有方面得到完整一致的体现，显示了在亲密关系研究领域中性别差异问题本身的复杂性...|$|R
