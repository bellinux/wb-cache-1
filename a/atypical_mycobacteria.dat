The low predictive value is a result of cross-reactivity with BCG and <b>atypical</b> <b>mycobacteria,</b> as well as falsenegative reactions in malnourished children. BCG has been used as an antigen in EIAs in in vitro studies to determine disease activity, but its use was suspended because of difficulties in interpretation, problems differentiating between active or past disease, and low sensitivity and specificity.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Epidemiological {{studies of}} Non-tuberculosis Mycobacterium is {{important}} because of the drug resistance pattern and worldwide dissemination of these organisms. One of genetic fingerprinting methods for epidemiological studies is VNTR (Variable Number Tandem Repeat).

Methods: 48 pulmonary and non pulmonary specimens separated from patients with the symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and identified as Non-tuberculosis Mycobacteriumby phenotypic and PCR-RFLP methods were selected for this study. Clinical samples and their standard strains were evaluated according to VNTR pattern using the 7 genetic loci including ETR-B. ETR-F. ETR-C. MPTR-A. ETR-A. ETR-E. ETR-D.

Subjects: A total of 386 stool specimens from suspected AIDS patients from the two health institutions plus 81 stool specimens from clinically healthy patients were collected. The number of patients from MCU was 144 (49 females, 95 males) and 242 from BRIDH (119 males, 123 females). Main Outcome Measure: The main goals were to determine optimum exposure time and optimum concentration of alkali used in decontamination and to identify the culture medium with the best recovery rates of <b>atypical</b> <b>mycobacteria.</b> Results: Optimum recovery of <b>atypical</b> <b>mycobacteria</b> was achieved on Peizer TB medium after treating stool specimens with 4 % sodium hydroxide for 35 minutes.
