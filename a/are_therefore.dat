5|$|Boron nitride is {{insoluble}} in {{the usual}} acids, but is soluble in alkaline molten salts and nitrides, such as LiOH, KOH, NaOH-Na2CO3, NaNO3, Li3N, Mg3N2, Sr3N2, Ba3N2 or Li3BN2, which <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> used to etch BN.|$|E
5|$|Induced {{defenses}} include secondary metabolic products, {{as well as}} morphological {{and physiological}} changes. An advantage of inducible, as opposed to constitutive defenses, {{is that they are}} only produced when needed, and <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> potentially less costly, especially when herbivory is variable.|$|E
30|$|The {{prognosis}} {{depends on}} prompt treatment. It <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> important to perform cervicovaginal swabs on women at risk because of IUD use [9]. This examination allows diagnosing Actinomycoses quite early. Treatment <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> simpler and results are better.|$|R

5|$|Old {{styles are}} {{considered}} slow, well-pronounced and dignified like the Maguindanao’s kamamatuan and the Maranao’s andung. Genres classified under this style have moderate tempos, are rhythmically oriented, balanced, lack many improvisations {{and are usually}} played by the older folks and <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> always played first, to give due respect to the older generation.|$|E
5|$|Onions <b>are,</b> <b>therefore,</b> {{commonly}} {{employed in}} science education {{to teach the}} use of a microscope for observing cell structure.|$|E
5|$|References to the Mommsen text {{is based}} on the Project Gutenburg e-text edition of the books. References <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> given in terms of line numbers within the text file, and not page numbers as would be the case with a {{physical}} book.|$|E
5000|$|Nothing, {{specifically}} Pure Nothing, [...] "is simply equality with itself, complete emptiness, {{absence of}} all determination and content." [...] It <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> identical with <b>Being,</b> {{except that it}} is thought of as its very opposite. This distinction <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> meaningful as posited by thought.|$|R
50|$|This <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> {{an unusual}} house for Spain, one that {{existed at the}} same time as the great Italian houses or villas. It gives witness to how life was lived as from the High Middle Ages and <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> a {{significant}} part of the Spanish Cultural heritage.|$|R

The output voltage <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> [...] Assuming that the amplifier input draws no current, all of the input current flows through , and <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> given by ...|$|R
5|$|The {{multiple}} {{side chains}} of amino acids can also undergo chemical reactions. The types of these reactions {{are determined by}} the groups on these side chains and <b>are,</b> <b>therefore,</b> different between the various types of amino acid.|$|E
5|$|The shaded north {{slopes of}} cinder cones provide more {{protection}} from direct sunlight and prevailing southwesterly winds {{and have a}} more persistent snow cover (an important water source in early spring). These parts of cinder cones <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> colonized by plants first.|$|E
5|$|This allows more {{resources}} to be allocated to more intensive strategies focusing on higher risk entities, providing an incentive to entities {{to want to be}} seen to be compliant. The robustness of the risk assessments, {{and the quality of the}} data on which the assessments rely, <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> very important.|$|E

5|$|Warner Home Video {{released}} a complete series collection on Blu-ray on November 13, 2012. The collection does not feature the extra deleted scenes and jokes that were included on prior DVD releases, and <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> presented in their NBC broadcast versions.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} have odd atomic numbers; hence, their {{isotopes}} must be either odd–odd (both proton and neutron number are odd) or odd–even (proton number is odd, but neutron number is even). Odd–odd nuclei have even mass numbers, whereas odd–even nuclei have odd mass numbers. Odd–odd primordial nuclides are rare because most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable {{with respect to}} beta decay, because the decay products are even–even, and <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> more strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects.|$|E
5|$|At ambient {{conditions}} bismuth shares the same layered structure as the metallic forms of arsenic and antimony, crystallizing in the rhombohedral lattice (Pearson symbol hR6, space group Rm No. 166), {{which is often}} classed into trigonal or hexagonal crystal systems. When compressed at room temperature, this Bi-I structure changes first to the monoclinic Bi-II at 2.55 GPa, then to the tetragonal Bi-III at 2.7 GPa, and finally to the body-centered cubic Bi-IV at 7.7 GPa. The corresponding transitions can be monitored via changes in electrical conductivity; they are rather reproducible and abrupt, and <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> used for calibration of high-pressure equipment.|$|E

50|$|Italian is a Romance language, and <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> a {{descendant}} of Vulgar Latin (the spoken form of non-classical Latin). Standard Italian is based on Tuscan, especially its Florentine dialect, and <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> an Italo-Dalmatian language, to which Sicilian and the extinct Dalmatian also belong, among a few others.|$|R
50|$|The first subnet {{obtained}} from subnetting has all bits in the subnet bit group set to zero (0). It <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> called subnet zero. The last subnet {{obtained from}} subnetting has all bits in the subnet bit group set to one (1). It <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> called the all-ones subnet.|$|R
5|$|Backcountry hiking is {{available}} in the Craters of the Moon Wilderness and the much larger Backcountry Area beyond (added in 2000). Only two trails enter the wilderness area and even those stop after a few miles or kilometers. From there most hikers follow the Great Rift and explore its series of seldom-visited volcanic features. All overnight backcountry hikes require registration with a ranger. No drinking water {{is available}} in the backcountry and the dry climate quickly dehydrates hikers. Avoiding summer heat and winter cold <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> recommended by rangers. Pets, camp fires, and all mechanized vehicles, including bicycles, are not allowed in the wilderness area.|$|E
5|$|Birds are now {{recognized}} {{as being the}} sole surviving lineage of theropod dinosaurs. In traditional taxonomy, birds were considered a separate class that had evolved from dinosaurs, a distinct superorder. However, a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with dinosaurs reject the traditional style of classification in favor of phylogenetic taxonomy; this approach requires that, for a group to be natural, all descendants {{of members of the}} group must be included in the group as well. Birds are thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs <b>are,</b> <b>therefore,</b> not extinct. Birds are classified as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora, which are coelurosaurs, which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Both Pyrrhocorax {{species have}} {{extensive}} geographical ranges and large populations; neither {{is thought to}} approach the thresholds for the global population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and they <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> evaluated as being of Least Concern. However, some populations, particularly on islands such as Corsica and La Palma are small and isolated.|$|E
5000|$|... v-Src {{lacks the}} C-terminal {{inhibitory}} phosphorylation site (tyrosine-527), and <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> constitutively active {{as opposed to}} normal Src (c-Src) which is only activated under certain circumstances where it is required (e.g. growth factor signaling). v-Src <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> an instructive example of an oncogene whereas c-Src is a proto-oncogene.|$|R

5|$|Copper, zinc, tin, {{and lead}} are {{mechanically}} weaker metals but have useful corrosion prevention properties. While {{each of them}} will react with air, the resulting patinas of either various copper salts, zinc carbonate, tin oxide, or a mixture of lead oxide, carbonate, and sulfate, confer valuable protective properties. Copper and lead <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> used, for example, as roofing materials; zinc acts as an anti-corrosion agent in galvanised steel; and tin serves a similar purpose on steel cans.|$|E

5|$|Dengue fever virus (DENV) is an RNA virus of {{the family}} Flaviviridae; genus Flavivirus. Other {{members of the same}} genus include yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, St. Louis {{encephalitis}} virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus. Most are transmitted by arthropods (mosquitoes or ticks), and <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> also referred to as arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses).|$|E
