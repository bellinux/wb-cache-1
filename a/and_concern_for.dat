5|$|Edward {{enjoyed a}} good {{relationship}} with Pope Clement V, despite the King's repeated intervention in the operation of the English Church, including punishing bishops with whom he disagreed. With Clement's support, Edward attempted to gain the financial support of the English Church for his military campaigns in Scotland, including taxation and borrowing money against the funds gathered for the crusades. The English Church did relatively little to influence or moderate Edward's behaviour during his reign, possibly because of the bishops' self-interest <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> their own protection.|$|E

40|$|An {{understanding}} of personal preferences and attitudes {{is crucial in}} order to design an income tax system that people find fair. We have examined, {{by means of an}} economic experiment, how selfishness, risk preferences <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> the equality/efficiency tradeoff relate to preferences for progressive taxation. Our results indicate that there is no direct link between selfishness and tax preferences. Nevertheless, the degree of selfishness seems to affect the relationship between the other variables. For people who are not very selfish, both risk aversion <b>and</b> a <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> efficiency correspond with a positive attitude towards progressive taxation. As the degree of selfishness increases, risk preferences <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> equality <b>and</b> efficiency become less important. At high levels of selfishness, neither selfishness, risk preferences nor <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> equality <b>and</b> efficiency seem to explain preferences for progressive taxation. In conclusion, income tax preferences are based on both moral <b>and</b> selfish <b>concerns...</b>|$|R
