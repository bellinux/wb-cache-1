5|$|This Joker's Card is a {{representation}} of the ghettos <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> that occurs within them. It {{takes the form of a}} traveling carnival which releases the same brutality on those who have ignored the inner cities' cries for help. The Card issues a warning against the upper-class and government's negligence toward the lower classes. The cover of Carnival of Carnage was drawn by Joseph Utsler, who would later create artwork for the rest of the albums in the Joker's Cards series.|$|E
5|$|As it {{is clear}} that the demands of his job are taking a toll on Chris, Carla becomes {{increasingly}} uncomfortable with the brutal competition among firms <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> they incite in other countries. Seeking an escape from Shorn and to save their marriage, Carla, with the help of her father, who lives in the London Zones, and her mother in Sweden, secures a position at the United Nations as an Ombudsman, a sort of outside auditor/investigator who attempts to enforce the UN's mandate across the world. This position is viewed as honourable but ultimately ineffective as neither the US nor UK recognise the UN's authority and run roughshod over them in their pursuit of profits. After an initially frosty meeting, Chris' conditions are agreed on, but with the requirement that he stay in place at Shorn through the end of the current conflict in Cambodia, in which Shorn is backing a rebel leader.|$|E
5|$|Biden was re-elected to the Senate six times, and was {{the fourth}} most senior senator {{at the time of}} his {{resignation}} to assume the Vice Presidency in 2009. He was a long-time member and former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He opposed the Gulf War in 1991, but advocated U.S. and NATO intervention in the Bosnian War in 1994 and 1995. He voted in favor of the resolution authorizing the Iraq War in 2002, but opposed the surge of U.S. troops in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, and led the legislative efforts for creation of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Violence</b> Against Women Act. He chaired the Judiciary Committee during the contentious U.S. Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.|$|E

5|$|The {{general strike}} of 1950 {{began in the}} coal mining centres of Hainaut and quickly spread. Workers were soon on strike across Wallonia, Brussels, and, to a lesser extent, Flanders. The port of Antwerp {{was one of the}} key sites {{affected}} and the country was virtually paralysed. On 30 July, four workers were shot dead by the Gendarmerie at Grâce-Berleur, near Liège <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> intensified. Staunch Leopoldists in the Government called for a stronger stance but found themselves in a minority, even in the PSC–CVP. Frustrated at the lack of progress, the Government threatened to resign en masse.|$|E

25|$|Stuart {{graduated}} from West Point in 1854, {{and served in}} Texas and Kansas with the U.S. Army.

25|$|Since 2001 Drumcree {{has been}} {{relatively}} calm, with outside support for the Portadown lodges' campaign declining <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> lessening greatly. Mac Cionnaith said that he believes the conflict is essentially over. The Orange Order continues to campaign {{for the right to}} march on Garvaghy Road.|$|E
25|$|The {{strike was}} called off on 11 October 1936 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> abated {{for about a}} year while the Peel Commission deliberated. The Royal Commission was {{announced}} on 18 May 1936 and its members were appointed on 29 July, but the Commission did not arrive in Palestine until 11 November.|$|E
25|$|These {{tensions}} spurred eight civil wars, {{interrupted by}} periods of relative calm, between 1562 and 1598. With each break in peace, the Huguenots' {{trust in the}} Catholic throne diminished, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> became more severe, and Protestant demands became grander, until a lasting cessation of open hostility finally occurred in 1598.|$|E
25|$|This view—that {{the modern}} state {{replaced}} chaos and general violence with internal disciplinary structures—has been challenged as ethnocentric, <b>and</b> ignoring <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> of modern states.|$|R

25|$|His two prints with a {{hurdy-gurdy}} man {{come from}} a very different world of genre works and realism, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> of the larger one was original at the time, anticipating themes to be taken up in later decades by the slightly younger Lorraine artist Jacques Callot and others.|$|E
25|$|Disturbances in {{what was}} Northern Rhodesia in 1959 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> against whites in the Belgian Congo and French Congo in early 1959 created a climate of fear amongst the white population. As a consequence, a {{security}} crackdown in Rhodesia occurred, which was largely a preemptive strike against further nationalist organising of blacks and against potential African unrest.|$|E
25|$|Aristide's radical populist {{policies}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> of his {{bands of}} supporters alarmed {{many of the}} country's elite, and, in September 1991, he was overthrown in the 1991 Haitian coup d'état, which brought General Raoul Cédras to power. The coup saw hundreds killed, and Aristide was forced into exile, his life saved by international diplomatic intervention.|$|E

25|$|The first Joker's Card, Carnival of Carnage (1992), is a {{representation}} of the ghetto <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> that occurs within.

The Card issues a warning against the upper-class and government's negligence toward the lower classes.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{destruction}} layers {{corresponding to}} {{the same time period}} were also found in Ujjain and Pataliputra, also suggesting destructions brought by the Indo-Greeks, and giving an archaeological indication of the extent <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> of their foray into India. These destructions also correspond {{to the end of the}} Northern Black Polished Ware pottery culture in northern India. Carbon dating also confirmed the general time period of these destruction layers to circa 160 BCE.|$|E
25|$|From the {{inception}} of the violence that began in Syria {{as a result of the}} Arab Spring, the Syrian Civil War has produced and inspired a great deal of strife and unrest among armed factions. Prior to the Battle of Arsal in August 2014, the Lebanese Army has tried to keep out of it <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> has been mostly between various factions within the country and overt Syrian involvement has been limited to airstrikes and occasional accidental incursions.|$|E

25|$|In 1555, the Peace of Augsburg was signed, which {{confirmed}} {{the result of}} the Diet of Speyer (1526) <b>and</b> ended <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> between <b>the</b> Catholics <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Lutherans in the Holy Roman Empire.|$|R
25|$|A Turkish mob, most {{of which}} had been trucked into the city in advance, {{assaulted}} Istanbul’s Greek community for nine hours. Although the mob did not explicitly call for Greeks to be killed, over a dozen people died during or after the attacks as a result of beatings and arson. Armenians were also harmed. The police remained mostly ineffective, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> continued until the government declared martial law in İstanbul and called in the army to put down the riots.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, Mashinini {{began working}} in the Henochsberg {{clothing}} factory, which was segregated by race as well as gender. In addition to the difficult conditions and bad pay offered to factory workers, Black women faced a unique and many-layered set of challenges. Treated as inferior to other workers, Black women faced police brutality <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> of poverty under Apartheid when they returned home each day. Black workers also faced difficulties in getting to work on time—from the segregated neighbourhoods to {{which they had been}} confined.|$|E
25|$|Urdu {{short stories}} {{have dealt with}} a wide range of the {{dimensions}} of life, but the most famous stories concern the trauma of the independence of Pakistan in 1947 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> generated out of it. Towards the end of the last century, short stories became grounded in the complexity of daily life which can be seen in the unique collection of short stories in Paigham Afaqui's Mafia. An entirely different approach is seen in the collection of short stories T'abir by Moinuddin Jinabade and Taus Chaman Ka Maina by Nayyer Masood.|$|E
