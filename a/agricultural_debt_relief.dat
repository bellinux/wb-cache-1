The agreement, adopted by heads of state at the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico, in March 2001, contains commitments by all countries for specific actions to help low-income countries achieve the MDGs. 2 The Consensus recognizes that the main responsibility for accelerating development lies with the governments of poor countries themselves, which must put in place appropriate policy and institutional frameworks and make the sometimes difficult decisions necessary to ensure full implementation. It also acknowledges that poor countries themselves cannot achieve the goals, or even make significant progress towards them, without the cooperation and assistance of the international community.

40|$|The {{history of}} <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> goes back several decades. It reveals that a country’s {{accumulation}} of unsustainable debt stems from {{such factors as}} defi ciencies in macroeconomic management, adverse terms-of-trade shocks, and poor governance. Debt-relief initiatives have provided debt-burdened countries with {{the opportunity for a}} fresh start, but whether the benefi ts of <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> can be preserved depends on transformations in a country’s policies and institutions. In 1996, the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative was launched as the fi rst comprehensive, multilateral, debt-relief framework for low-income countries. In 2005, the Multilateral <b>Debt</b> <b>Relief</b> Initiative was established, which increased the level of <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> provided to HIPCs. As of early 2009, assistance through these two initiatives had been committed to 35 countries and amounted to US$ 117 billion in nominal terms, or half of the 2007 GDP of these countries. <b>Debt</b> <b>Relief</b> and Beyond assesses the implications of <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> for low-income countries and how its benefi ts can be preserved and used to fi ght poverty.

40|$|The {{perceived}} lack of conclusive quantitative {{evidence on}} the macroeconomic effects of <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> in low-income countries has generally blurred the image of <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> efforts and left the issues of its effectiveness and efficiency open to debate and dispute. This thesis seeks to shed more light on the subject by providing some further empirical evidence. This objective is achieved by performing an empirical investigation of two effects of <b>debt</b> <b>relief.</b> First, the study examines the debt relief-new borrowing relationship in a multivariable regression framework. The results that emerge suggest that, on average, <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> can be beneficial in reducing the future new borrowing of Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs). This conclusion, to some extent, {{is in line with}} the goals of HIPCs <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> initiatives in reducing external debt burdens of those countries to sustainable levels. However, it presents a challenge to the views of William Easterly on the ‘perverse incentive effects’ of ‘continuing waves’ of <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> that are said to lead to further debt accumulation of a similar magnitude to replace old cancelled debt. Second, the analysis explores the influence of <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> on domestic investment behaviour in developing countries. <b>Debt</b> <b>relief</b> is found to {{have a positive effect on}} domestic investment in countries with good policy environments.
