President Violeta Chamorro stated in her speech to her nation on September 2, 1992, that no international <b>assistance</b> <b>was</b> needed. However, the Red Cross did assist in some operations while the National Civil Defence carried out much of the relief operations, with wounded people being transported to the Hospital Leon and Lenin-Fonseca Hospital.|$|E

40|$|The {{principle}} of mutual legal <b>assistance</b> <b>is</b> a traditional one. It {{is governed by}} law, bilateral treaties as well as international conventions. Legal <b>assistance</b> <b>is</b> mutually offered by the courts, domestically and abroad. Therefore, we speak of domestic and international legal assistance. The legal <b>assistance</b> <b>is</b> provided {{in such a manner}} that a court undertakes actions in civil proceedings that are ongoing before another court. The most common form of legal <b>assistance</b> <b>is</b> to hear evidence in a situation when such evidence cannot be presented before the court conducting the civil proceedings. However the scope of the mutual legal <b>assistance</b> <b>is</b> much wider. It can be both necessary and expedient. The expediency of the legal <b>assistance</b> <b>is</b> more closely related to a situation when a domestic court is engaged to undertake a certain action in civil proceedings, while the expediency is the most evident when the legal <b>assistance</b> <b>is</b> requested by a foreign court or state organ. Application of the rules on the regulation of mutual legal assistance makes for more efficient civil proceedings, however it represents a deviation from the {{principle of}} direct, or immediate examination of evidence by the court conducting the proceedings...|$|R

Mechanical circulatory <b>assistance</b> <b>is</b> treated giving two examples where it is represented with two different approaches: representing the physical device or its functional aspects. The parallel LVAD <b>assistance</b> <b>is</b> simulated modeling the pneumatic ventricle and its main components. IABP <b>assistance</b> <b>is</b> simulated modeling the IABP as a zero average flow generator. In both cases the <b>assistance</b> <b>is</b> connected to the comprehensive basic circulatory model that permits to analyze the mutual influence between the device and the circulatory conditions...|$|R

Financial <b>assistance</b> <b>was</b> provided by Bad Apple Films of Spokane, Washington.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Britain in 1883, Louise continued {{to take an}} interest in Canada. During the North-West Rebellion of 1885 she sent a certain Dr. Boyd with medical supplies and a large fund of money for distribution. Her express instructions were that <b>assistance</b> <b>was</b> to be rendered to friend and foe indiscriminately. To fulfill her wishes, Boyd accompanied the Militia Medical Staff, under Dr. Thomas Roddick to the sites of the Battle of Fish Creek and the Battle of Batoche to help give medical treatment to the wounded, including the Métis opposition.|$|E
5|$|Among the crusaders in the Crusade of 1101 were Stephen II, Count of Blois and Hugh of Vermandois, both of {{whom had}} {{returned}} home before reaching Jerusalem. This crusade was almost annihilated in Asia Minor by the Seljuqs, but the survivors helped to reinforce the kingdom upon their arrival in Jerusalem. In the following years, <b>assistance</b> <b>was</b> also provided by Italian merchants who established themselves in Syrian ports, and from the religious and military orders of the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller, which were created during Baldwin I's reign.|$|E

5|$|As the P.1127 {{had been}} {{developed}} {{at a time of}} deep UK defense cuts, Hawker had to seek commercial funding, and significant engine development funding came from the U.S. Research <b>assistance</b> <b>was</b> also provided by U.S.; including a series of wind tunnel tests conducted by NASA's Langley Research Center using sub-scale models, which demonstrated acceptable flight characteristics. Hawker test pilot Hugh Merewether went to the U.S. at NASA's request to fly the Bell X-14. In March 1959, the company's board of directors (Hawker Siddeley then) decided to privately fund two P.1127 prototypes.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{supported}} British {{involvement in}} the Manhattan Project to the fullest extent, abandoning any hopes of a British project during the war. With Churchill's backing, he attempted to ensure that every request from Groves for <b>assistance</b> <b>was</b> honoured. While the pace of research was easing as the war entered its final phase, these scientists were still in great demand, and it fell to Anderson, Cherwell and Sir Edward Appleton, the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, which was responsible for Tube Alloys, to prise {{them away from the}} wartime projects in which they were invariably engaged.|$|E
5|$|Chuuk Governor Johnson Elimo {{issued a}} state of {{emergency}} on April1 and stated that international <b>assistance</b> <b>was</b> necessary. Immediate concerns included the possibility of residents starving with most of the state's crops ruined. Yap Governor Tony Ganngiyan also issued {{a state of}} emergency on April1. On April9, the Congress of the Federated States of Micronesia held a special two-day session at the request of President Manny Mori, which included determination of typhoon relief funds. They allocated $1.5million toward relief for Chuuk and Yap States on April11. The president also issued a price freeze to pre-storm levels to prevent price gouging.|$|E

5|$|Following the storm, three New York {{counties}} were declared {{eligible for}} individual assistance, eight for individual and public assistance, and four for public assistance. The initial deadline {{to apply for}} state or federal <b>assistance</b> <b>was</b> set for November 17, although it was extended a month due to {{a steady flow of}} applications. Three disaster recovery centers were opened to provide information to residents affected by the storm. The three centers, located in Rockland, Putnam, and Westchester counties, closed in late October.|$|E
5|$|On 26 November, {{the detainees}} were deported, {{along with their}} families. Although this was an entirely German initiative—Quisling himself was left unaware {{although}} government <b>assistance</b> <b>was</b> provided—Quisling led the Norwegian public {{to believe that the}} first deportation of Jews, to camps in Poland, was his idea. A further 250 were deported in February 1943, and it remains unclear what the party's official position was on the eventual fate of the 759 Norwegian deportees. There is evidence to suggest that Quisling honestly believed the official line throughout 1943 and 1944, that they were awaiting repatriation to a new Jewish homeland.|$|E
5|$|On August 23 the Haitian {{government}} sent food, sachets of potable water, mattresses, and medicines to {{the town}} of Bainet in the Sud-Est department. On August 24 the Pan American Development Foundation sent food to all people living in temporary shelters and Venezuela delivered 11 tonnes of emergency food to Sud-Est in 500 family bags. Hurricane <b>assistance</b> <b>was</b> then compounded by the country's standard humanitarian assistance programs and became indistinct from the country's continued poverty crisis.|$|E

5|$|On October29, in {{the wake}} of Omar, President George W. Bush signed a major {{disaster}} declaration for the United States Virgin Islands, allowing public aid to assist the islands. The Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA, had received 60 requests for public assistance throughout the area. Monetary value for the <b>assistance</b> <b>was</b> estimated at $3million and growing. Twenty-five departments and agencies were approved of for federal support, namely the U.S. V.I. Department of Public Works. Several non-profit organizations also received support from FEMA, while those that did not meet the criteria were referred to the Small Business Administration’s low-interest loan program.|$|E
5|$|Power {{companies}} from several states sent workers {{to help restore}} service to the hardest-hit areas of the Gulf Coast. Most of Alabama Power's affected customers had power within 24 hours of the storm, though restoration of service to Dauphin Island took significantly longer. Power was fully restored to Central Louisiana Electric customers by September 4. Alabama's two coastal counties were declared federal disaster areas on September 7. Special loan <b>assistance</b> <b>was</b> made available by the Small Business Administration and the Farmers Home Administration, the latter of which sought to help commercial growers who lost their crops to the storm.|$|E

5|$|The {{hospital}} {{cared for}} more than 4,500 patients (most of them Jews) from 20 countries, suffering from starvation, alimentary dystrophy, gangrene, necrosis, internal haemorrhaging, and typhoid fever. At least 500 patients died. <b>Assistance</b> <b>was</b> provided by volunteers from Oświęcim and Brzeszcze, who donated money and food, cleaned hospital rooms, delivered water, washed patients, cooked meals, buried the dead, and transported the sick in horse-drawn carts between locations. Securing enough food for thousands of former prisoners was a constant challenge. The hospital director personally went from village to village to collect milk.|$|E
5|$|This {{letter was}} one of several that Travis sent during the siege of the Alamo. Each carried a similar message—the Mexican army had invaded Texas, the Alamo was surrounded, and the Texians needed more men and {{ammunition}} to wage a successful defense. No <b>assistance</b> <b>was</b> forthcoming from the Texas government. By this point infighting had rendered the provisional government completely ineffective, and delegates convened on March 1 at the Convention of 1836 to create a new government. Most of the delegates believed that Travis exaggerated the difficulties he faced.|$|E
