These systems are symmetric and conservative. Rigorous convergence results are provided showing that solutions of the complete free-surface Euler equa-tions tend to associated solutions of these systems as the amplitude becomes small and the wavelength large.

In particular, this remark applies to the original system derived by Boussinesq.

40|$|We {{construct}} a minimal mass blow up {{solution of the}} modified Benjamin-Ono equation (mBO) \[u_{t}+(u^ 3 -D^ 1 u) _{x}= 0, \] which is a standard mass critical dispersive model. Let $Q\in H^{\frac 12 }$, $Q> 0 $, be the unique ground state solution of $D^ 1 Q +Q=Q^ 3 $, constructed using variational arguments by Weinstein (Comm. PDE, 12 (1987), J. Diff.

40|$|The Boussinesq abcd {{system is}} a 4 -parameter set of {{equations}} posed in R_t ×R_x, originally derived by Bona, Chen <b>and</b> <b>Saut</b> as first order 2 -wave approximations of the incompressible and irrotational, two dimensional water wave equations in the shallow water wave regime, {{in the spirit of}} the original Boussinesq derivation. Among many particular regimes, depending each of them in terms of the value of the parameters (a,b,c,d) present in the equations, the "generic" regime is characterized by the setting b,d> 0 and a,c< 0. The system is hamiltonian if also b=d. The equations in this regime are globally well-posed in the energy space H^ 1 × H^ 1, provided one works with small solutions. In this paper, we investigate decay and the scattering problem in this regime, which is characterized as having (quadratic) long-range nonlinearities, very weak linear decay O(t^- 1 / 3) because of the one dimensional setting, and existence of non scattering solutions (solitary waves). We prove, among other results, that for a sufficiently dispersive abcd systems (characterized only in terms of parameters a, b and c), all small solutions must decay to zero, locally strongly in the energy space, in proper subset of the light cone |x|≤ |t|. We prove this result by constructing three suitable virial functionals in the spirit of works by Kowalczyk, Martel and the second author, and more recently by the last three authors (valid for the simpler scalar "good Boussinesq" model), leading to global in time decay and control of all local H^ 1 × H^ 1 terms.

The Cauchy-problem for the {{generalized}} Kadomtsev-Petviashvili-II equation ut + uxxx + ∂ − 1 x uyy = (u l) x, l ≥ 3, {{is shown to}} be locally well-posed in almost critical anisotropic Sobolev spaces. The proof combines local smoothing and maximal function estimates as well as bilinear refinements of Strichartz type inequalities via multilinear interpolation in Xs,b-spaces. Inspired {{by the work of}} Kenig and Ziesler [13], [14] we consider the Cauchy problem (1) u(x, y, 0) = u 0 (x, y), (x, y) ∈ R 2 for {{the generalized}} Kadomtsev-Petviashvili-II equation (for short: gKP-II) (2) ut + uxxx + ∂ − 1 x uyy = (u l) x, where l ≥ 3 is an integer. Concerning earlier results on related problems for this equation we refer to the works of Saut [15], Iório and Nunes [8], and Hayashi, Naumkin, <b>and</b> <b>Saut</b> [7]. For the Cauchy data we shall assume u 0 ∈ H (s), where for s = (s 1, s 2, ε) the Sobolev type space H (s) is defined by its norm in the following way: Let ξ:= (k, η) ∈ R 2 denote the Fourier variables corresponding to (x, y) ∈ R 2 and 〈Dx 〉 σ 1 = F − 1 〈k 〉 σ 1 F, 〈Dy 〉 σ 2 = F − 1 〈η 〉 σ 2 F, as well as 〈D− 1 x Dy 〉 σ 3 = F − 1 〈k− 1 η 〉 σ 3 F, where F denotes the Fourier transform and 〈x 〉 σ = (1 + x 2) σ 2. Setting we define ‖u 0 ‖σ 1,σ 2,σ 3 : = ‖〈Dx 〉 σ 1 〈Dy 〉 σ 2 〈D − 1 x Dy 〉 σ 3 u 0 ‖ L 2 xy ‖u 0 ‖ H (s) : = ‖u 0 ‖s 1 + 2 s 2 +ε, 0, 0 + ‖u 0 ‖s 1,s 2,ε. Almost the same data spaces are considered in [13], [14], the only new element here is the additional parameter s 2, which will play a major role only for powers l ≥ 4. Using the contraction mapping principle we will prove a local well-posedness result for (1), (2) with regularity assumptions on the data as weak as possible.
