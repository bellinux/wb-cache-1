60|$|He {{stood in}} the road, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> placid {{buildings}} resentfully.|$|E
60|$|Arnold frowned, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky-signs {{upon the}} other side of the river.|$|E
60|$|My mother {{shook her}} head, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{flitches}} of bacon {{that hung from}} the ceiling.|$|E
60|$|She {{closed the}} book <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him with {{twinkling}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|Donovan {{went to the}} {{hind wheel}} <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> James Williams.|$|R
60|$|She ceased bathing his arm, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him {{suddenly}} quite pale.|$|R
60|$|He {{broke off}} <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> range, while {{the faces of}} the others grew intent as they watched him.|$|E
60|$|The pestle {{and mortar}} on the cask {{attracted}} his attention. He stopped <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{man in the}} hammock.|$|E
60|$|She landed safely on {{the other}} side, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{beautiful}} though pale and weary face of her young mistress.|$|E
60|$|She {{dropped her}} sewing {{in her lap}} <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me quickly.|$|R
60|$|Chiltern {{paused in}} his tugging <b>at</b> the straps, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|R
60|$|She dried her eyes, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} a hopeless little smile.|$|R
6000|$|Lucie climbed {{upon the}} stile <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hill behind Little-town--a hill that goes up-up--into the clouds {{as though it}} had no top! ...|$|E
60|$|As Tarzan {{approached}} the plane Numa walked at his side, and when Tarzan stopped <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{girl and the}} man Numa stopped also.|$|E
60|$|They {{leaned over}} the track <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> next station, where the train, just starting, throbbed out the flame-shot steam into the white moonlight.|$|E
60|$|She sighed, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him through}} a little cloud of tobacco smoke.|$|R
60|$|She {{took hold}} of both of his hands, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him pleadingly.|$|R
60|$|He {{took her}} hand <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her. She bent down and kissed him.|$|R
60|$|Midwinter paused {{before he}} answered, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky. The clouds had been {{gathering}} unnoticed over their heads, {{and the first}} rain-drops were beginning to fall.|$|E
60|$|Lapham {{turned away}} <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> building. His wife pulled {{a little at}} her glove, as if embarrassed, or even pained. She {{tried to make a}} diversion.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's hard {{to realize}} that {{disaster}} came so near to us," [...] he said, musingly, and Elsie shaded {{her eyes with her}} hand <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hills.|$|E
60|$|She {{held out}} a very {{diminutive}} palm <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me with a beaming smile.|$|R
60|$|He hesitated again, {{gripping}} the window strap, putting his face forward <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me appealingly.|$|R
60|$|She {{rested her}} head caressingly on his shoulder, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with her}} charming smile.|$|R
60|$|Little Em'ly {{had stopped}} <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky in her {{enumeration}} of these articles, {{as if they}} were a glorious vision. We went on again, picking up shells and pebbles.|$|E
60|$|When the throb {{of the car}} {{was getting}} faint she met Mortimer going to the lake. He stopped <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> valley, which was {{streaked}} by a thin line of dust.|$|E
60|$|They {{went down}} {{together}} into the musty hold, and when somebody lowered the big hose after them, Jefferson, standing upon the ladder, seized the rope, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Canarios clustering round the hatch above.|$|E
60|$|Barbara ceased her weeping, {{wiped her}} eyes {{with the back of}} her hand, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R

60|$|The {{girl did}} not answer him {{for at least a}} minute, and {{appeared}} concerned about something that rattled in the bicycle. Then she stopped <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> man with a great tenderness in her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|It {{occurred}} to him suddenly that he had forgotten larches. They, of course, could be heavenly, when you lay under them <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky, as he had that afternoon out there. Then he heard her say: ...|$|E
60|$|She {{clasped her}} hands <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moon--I can only suppose that her sentiments {{overpowered}} her. She said, very prettily, that {{her heart and}} my heart beat together in heavenly harmony. It is needless to add that this satisfied me.|$|E
60|$|Bes {{squatted down}} upon the floor <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me with a strange smile on his ugly face.|$|R
60|$|When it was {{finished}} she dropped her bow, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him with flushed cheeks and questioning eyes.|$|R
60|$|Laura sat still, and he {{laid a hand}} on her shoulder. Then {{she turned}} <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
