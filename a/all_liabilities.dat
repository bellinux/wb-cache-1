Unexpectedly large legal awards in US courts for punitive damages led to large claims, especially on APH (asbestos, pollution and health hazard) policies, some dating {{as far back as}} the 1940s. Many of these policies were designed to cover <b>all</b> <b>liabilities</b> that were typically excluded from broad-form (wide cover) liability policies.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the total deductibles and coinsurance Medicare beneficiaries accrued in 1980. The {{study shows that}} Part B services accounted for 70 percent of <b>all</b> <b>liability</b> and Part A for 30 percent. Only 21 percent of enrollees exceeded $ 270 in liability from Part A and Part B combined. In 1980, if every enrollee had paid a surcharge of about $ 70, <b>all</b> <b>liability</b> over $ 270 could have been capped—without any additional program outlays. Similarly, projections for 1984 indicate that a surcharge of $ 98 could cap <b>all</b> <b>liability</b> over $ 800.

The Bethlehem Steel Company (also known as Bethlehem Steel Works) was {{incorporated}} to take over <b>all</b> <b>liabilities</b> of the Bethlehem Iron Company. The ownership of both companies was identical, thus it was originally thought that the Bethlehem Iron Company was renamed Bethlehem Steel Company, though it is not the case. The Bethlehem Iron Company and the Bethlehem Steel Company are both separate companies with the exact same ownership. The Bethlehem Steel Company leased the properties that were owned by the Bethlehem Iron Company, even though both companies had the same ownership.|$|E

In three my cousin, satisfied {{that it was in}} able hands, began to cease his attendance at the office and betook himself to gardening which was his hobby. In four I paid him out altogether, although to do this I had to borrow money on our credit, for by agreement the title of the firm was continued. Then came that extraordinary time of boom which many will remember to their cost. I made a bold stroke and won.

His troupe had deserted {{him during his}} illness, and reconstituted {{under the direction of}} Polichinelle it was now striving with tolerable success to continue upon the lines which Andre-Louis had laid down. M. le Marquis, prevented by the riot from expressing in person to Mlle. Binet his purpose of making an end of their relations, had been constrained to write to her to that effect from Azyr a few days later. He tempered the blow by enclosing in discharge of <b>all</b> <b>liabilities</b> a bill on the Caisse d'Escompte for a hundred louis. Nevertheless it almost crushed the unfortunate and it enabled her father when he recovered to enrage her by pointing out that she owed this turn of events to the premature surrender she had made in defiance of his sound worldly advice. Father and daughter alike were left to assign the Marquis' desertion, naturally enough, to the riot at the Feydau. They laid that with the rest to the account of Scaramouche, and were forced in bitterness to admit that the scoundrel had taken a superlative revenge. Climene may even have come to consider that it would have paid her better to have run a straight course with Scaramouche and by marrying him to have trusted to his undoubted talents to place her on the summit to which her ambition urged her, and to which it was now futile for her to aspire. If so, that reflection must have been her sufficient punishment. For, as Andre-Louis so truly says, there is no worse hell than that provided by the regrets for wasted opportunities.|$|E
