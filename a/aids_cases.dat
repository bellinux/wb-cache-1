Additionally, this {{study examines}} the relationship of selection and training with injury reporting beyond that of rewards, because reporting relationships have not previously been examined in either of these areas. Study results indicate that employee per-ception of training {{is associated with a}} {{decrease in the number of}} unreported injuries including doctor’s attention, first <b>aid</b> <b>cases,</b> and near misses, and employee perceptions of selection are associated with a decrease in the number of unreported first <b>aid</b> <b>cases.</b> Both training and selection were related to the number of unreported injuries above and beyond the effect of rewards for safety. Implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
25|$|These {{claims are}} not {{supported}} by epidemiologic data. The average yearly increase in opioid-related deaths from 1990 to 2002 was nearly three times the yearly increase from 1979–90, with the greatest increase in 2000–02, yet <b>AIDS</b> <b>cases</b> and deaths fell dramatically during the mid-to-late-1990s. Duesberg's claim that recreational drug use, rather than HIV, {{was the cause of}} AIDS has been specifically examined and found to be false. Cohort studies have found that only HIV-positive drug users develop opportunistic infections; HIV-negative drug users do not develop such infections, indicating that HIV rather than drug use is the cause of AIDS.|$|E
25|$|The Ministry of Health {{has said}} there are 650,000 HIV/AIDS cases, half of them among {{intravenous}} drug users, out of a nation of 1.3 billion people. (Although this overall estimate of HIV and <b>AIDS</b> <b>cases</b> was lowered in January 2006 – in a report put together by the Chinese government, the World Health Organisation and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) – from 840,000 to 650,000, officials say this reflected the use of different statistical methodology rather than {{a drop in the}} incidence.) Epidemiology experts have said that 1.5 million is closer to the true figure.|$|E
25|$|Ethnicity {{can play}} an {{especially}} large part in determining health outcomes for impoverished minorities. Poverty can overpower race, but within poverty, race highly contributes to health outcomes. African Americans, even {{in some of the}} wealthiest cities in the United States, have lower life expectancy at birth than people in much poorer countries like China or India. According to studies, black individuals in South Africa suffer worse morbidity and mortality rates due to the limited access to social resources. Poverty is the chief cause of the endemic amounts of disease and hunger and malnutrition among this population. A disproportionate number of cases of the AIDS epidemic in North America are from American minorities, with 72% of women's <b>AIDS</b> <b>cases</b> among Hispanic or African-American women. Farmer says the growing mortality differentials between whites and blacks must be attributed to class differentials- which includes recognizing race within impoverished populations. Recognition of race as a determining factor for poor health without recognizing poverty has misled individuals to believe race is the only factor.|$|E

2500|$|The {{single most}} {{controversial}} {{element of the}} Brazilian HIV/AIDS response remains the free, universal provision of anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs), including protease inhibitors, starting in December 1996 with federal law 9313. The guidelines for antiretroviral therapy (ART) are formulated annually by a Support Committee which determines the diagnostic guidelines and {{the contents of the}} ARV cocktail.

2500|$|Duesberg {{states that}} African <b>AIDS</b> <b>cases</b> are [...] "a {{collection}} of long-established, indigenous diseases, such as chronic fevers, weight loss, alias [...] "slim disease," [...] diarrhea, and tuberculosis" [...] {{that result from}} malnutrition and poor sanitation. African <b>AIDS</b> <b>cases,</b> though, have increased {{in the last three}} decades as HIV's prevalence has increased but as malnutrition percentages and poor sanitation have declined in many African regions. In addition, while HIV and AIDS are more prevalent in urban than in rural settings in Africa, malnutrition and poor sanitation are found more commonly in rural than in urban settings.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{reported}} <b>AIDS</b> <b>cases</b> in Africa {{and other}} parts of the developing world include a larger proportion of people who do not belong to Duesberg's preferred risk groups of drug addicts and male homosexuals, Duesberg writes on his website that [...] "There are no risk groups in Africa, like drug addicts and homosexuals." [...] However, many studies have addressed the issue of risk groups in Africa and concluded that the risk of AIDS is not equally distributed. In addition, AIDS in Africa largely kills sexually active working-age adults.|$|E
2500|$|Brazil's first AIDS {{case was}} {{reported}} in 1982. Brazil’s AIDS response was crafted in 1985, just after the country had returned from military rule to democracy, {{at a time when}} only four <b>AIDS</b> <b>cases</b> had been reported. The Brazilian Ministry of Health laid the groundwork for a National AIDS Control Program (NACP) which was established in 1986, and placed {{under the aegis of the}} National AIDS Control Committee, a group composed of scientists and members of civil society organizations, in 1987. The program was reorganized again in 1992 with more emphasis on linkages between government and NGOs. [...] AIDS Project I garnered $90 million in domestic funds and a $160 million loan from the World Bank between 1992 and 1998.

50|$|Waitangi Tribunal {{claims have}} been a {{contributing}} factor to the growing cost of legal aid as Treaty claimants can apply for legal aid irrespective of their financial circumstances - {{which is not the}} case in civil or criminal cases. Since 2006, Waitangi tribunal cases have cost the taxpayer $79 million in legal aid, although as at January 2013, there were 780 claims still outstanding. Despite the large number of outstanding Treaty claims, these cases represent a fraction {{of the total number of}} legal <b>aid</b> <b>cases</b> - but are often among the most expensive. Dame Margaret Bazley's review of the legal aid process in 2009 found that of the 75 most expensive legal <b>aid</b> <b>cases</b> of 2008-09, 41% were for Treaty claims. In 2012, about 8% of the $148 million legal aid bill was spent on Treaty claims.|$|R
2500|$|For {{the next}} two years, Petrelis and other activists lobbied SFDPH to reverse the {{prohibition}} against bathhouses with locking doors. In 1999, the activists authored a ballot initiative to overturn the ban on private rooms in gay sex clubs and eliminate the requirement that club staff monitor consensual behavior among club patrons. Mitchell Katz, director of SFDPH, strongly opposed the initiative before it even qualified for the ballot; the San Francisco Chronicle editorialized against it, citing [...] "disturbing evidence of an upsurge in dangerous sex practices among some gays." [...] Petrelis responded by demanding that critics reveal the evidence they claimed, while citing statistics showing decreased incidence of both male rectal gonorrhea and new <b>AIDS</b> <b>cases</b> in San Francisco. Activists collected only four thousand signatures {{of the more than}} ten thousand needed to qualify the measure for the ballot in November 1999.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, Deming {{suggested}} [...] "There's {{just one}} problem with the gay agenda: it's based on a lie. Homosexuals are not like heterosexuals, nor is the practice of homosexuality innocuous. The single largest problem for the gay agenda is medical science. [...] The fact that about two-thirds of syphilis and <b>AIDS</b> <b>cases</b> occur amongst {{one percent of the}} population tells us something that is immediate and unambiguous: that homosexuality is not an innocuous choice. What gay men do behind closed doors is fundamentally different from what heterosexuals usually do in their bedrooms. [...] We are informed, endlessly, of the costs of gun violence, cigarette smoking, and obesity. What is the cost of homosexuality? How much does it cost to treat syphilis, AIDS, and a whole host of other diseases? What cost will we bear for the reemergence of syphilis, a disease that was almost eradicated? Neither are these plagues limited to gays. Bisexual men spread them into the heterosexual population." ...|$|E
2500|$|The NIAID {{reports that}} [...] "in the mid-1980s, {{clinical}} trials enrolling patients with AIDS found that AZT given as single-drug therapy conferred a modest survival advantage compared [...] placebo. Among HIV-infected {{patients who had}} not yet developed AIDS, placebo-controlled trials found that AZT given as single-drug therapy delayed, for a year or two, the onset of AIDS-related illnesses. Significantly, long-term follow-up of these trials did not show a prolonged benefit of AZT, but also did not indicate that the drug increased disease progression or mortality. The lack of excess <b>AIDS</b> <b>cases</b> and death in the AZT arms of these placebo-controlled trials in effect counters the argument that AZT causes AIDS. Subsequent clinical trials found that patients receiving two-drug combinations had up to 50 percent improvements in time to progression to AIDS and in survival when compared with people receiving single-drug therapy. In more recent years, three-drug combination therapies have produced another 50 to 80 percent improvement in progression to AIDS and in survival when compared with two-drug regimens in clinical trials." [...] "Use of potent anti-HIV combination therapies has contributed to dramatic reductions in the incidence of AIDS and AIDS-related deaths in populations where these drugs are widely available, an effect which clearly would not be seen if antiretroviral drugs caused AIDS." ...|$|E
