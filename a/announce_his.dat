5|$|By {{the time}} of his 1922 {{re-election}} bid, Barkley was the ranking Democrat on the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. In the election, he carried every First District county, including the Republican strongholds of Caldwell and Crittenden counties. Despite the victory he lacked the political organization needed for higher office. According to Barkley biographer James K. Libbey, the establishment of such an organization, and not necessarily a desire to become governor, may have motivated him to <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> candidacy for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination on November 11, 1922. Critics charged that this was his intent, and he did little to deny it.|$|E

The majority of the Assembly was Whig, and Clay {{knew that if he}} resigned while the Assembly was in session, the majority would elect a Whig to be his successor. By contrast, if he had waited until September 1 to <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> resignation the Assembly would already have closed its session, and Governor Powell, a Democrat, would appoint a temporary successor until the legislature convened again two years later.|$|E

5|$|On March 27, 1979, Brown {{interrupted}} his honeymoon with Phyllis George to <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> {{candidacy for}} governor of Kentucky. The announcement surprised most political observers because of his prior political apathy and because Brown had spent considerable time {{out of the state}} with his business ventures and lavish lifestyle. Funding his campaign with his own personal fortune, Brown launched a massive media campaign promoting his candidacy to help him overcome his late start in the race. He promised to run the state government like a business and to be a salesman for the state as governor.|$|E

5|$|Theophilos, in turn, was {{hesitant}} {{to believe the}} accusations, and was eventually convinced by the protovestiarios (chamberlain) Leo Chamodrakon and the synkellos John the Grammarian of his general's innocence.
