5|$|While hiking at {{a family}} reunion in 1980, Brodie became unusually tired. She was shortly {{diagnosed}} with metastatic lung cancer, although she had never smoked. Between chemotherapy treatments, she pushed ahead to complete the Nixon study, her three children and a daughter-in-law providing moral <b>and</b> <b>editorial</b> support in her time of need. Knowing that she could never complete a full biography, she ended the manuscript with Nixon's pre-presidential years, lending it an unfinished quality.|$|E

5|$|After the shootout in Tombstone, {{his pursuit}} {{and murder of}} those who {{attacked}} his brothers, and after leaving Arizona, Wyatt was often the target of negative newspaper stories that disparaged his and his brothers' reputation. His role in history has stimulated considerable ongoing scholarly <b>and</b> <b>editorial</b> debate. A large body of literature {{has been written about}} Wyatt Earp and his legacy, some of it highly fictionalized. Considerable portions of it are either full of admiration and flattery or hostile debunking.|$|E

Work on the book, The Finished Mystery, proceeded without the knowledge of the full Board of Directors <b>and</b> <b>Editorial</b> Committee and was released by Rutherford to headquarters staff on July 17, 1917, the day he announced the appointment of the four replacement directors.|$|E

5|$|The disdain of the British {{people for}} the Boers was {{recorded}} {{as early as the}} 18th century. The Boers were portrayed to the British public in literature <b>and</b> <b>editorial</b> cartoons as uncivilised and cruel, especially in order to obtain the support of the British public for British imperialism and the Second Boer War. The English term Boer-hater was used in a political context in the British Cape Colony as early as 1889, referring to persons opposing Cape Dutch interests, the use of their language in Parliament in particular.|$|E
5|$|Under Knight Ridder, The Inquirer {{continued}} to be editorially independent. However, conservative commentators have labeled The Inquirer left leaning, and the paper has not endorsed a Republican candidate for President of the United States since Gerald Ford in 1976. Throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century, groups supportive of Israel such as the Zionist Organization of America often accused The Inquirer of being anti-Israel. At the same time, Edward S. Herman, a University of Pennsylvania media analyst, has written many articles accusing The Inquirer of having given in to conservative pressure and including a conservative slant in the paper's reporting <b>and</b> <b>editorial</b> page. In 2006, The Inquirer {{became one of the}} only major United States newspapers to print one of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons. Afterwards, protesting the printing of the cartoon, Muslims picketed outside The Inquirer Building.|$|E
