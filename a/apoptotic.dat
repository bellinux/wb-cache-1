5|$|Apoptosis is a {{controlled}} {{process in which}} the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized <b>apoptotic</b> proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early <b>apoptotic</b> activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to <b>apoptotic</b> degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses use serpins {{to disrupt}} {{protease}} functions in their host. The cowpox viral serpin CrmA (cytokine response modifier A) {{is used in}} order to avoid inflammatory and <b>apoptotic</b> responses of infected host cells. CrmA increases infectivity by suppressing its host's inflammatory response through inhibition of IL-1 and L-18 processing by the cysteine protease caspase-1. In eukaryotes, a plant serpin inhibits both metacaspases and a papain-like cysteine protease.|$|E
5|$|Both {{internal}} and external signals {{can lead to the}} induction of apoptosis, or programmed cell death. The resulting deconstruction of cellular components is primarily carried out by specialized proteases known as caspases, but the proteasome also plays important and diverse roles in the <b>apoptotic</b> process. The involvement of the proteasome in this process is indicated by both the increase in protein ubiquitination, and of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes that is observed well in advance of apoptosis. During apoptosis, proteasomes localized to the nucleus have also been observed to translocate to outer membrane blebs characteristic of apoptosis.|$|E
5|$|Lipid {{asymmetry}} arises, {{at least}} in part, {{from the fact that}} most phospholipids are synthesised and initially inserted into the inner monolayer: those that constitute the outer monolayer are then transported from the inner monolayer by a class of enzymes called flippases. Other lipids, such as sphingomyelin, appear to be synthesised at the external leaflet. Flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases, which transfer lipids in the opposite direction, and scramblases, which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers (as in <b>apoptotic</b> cells). In any case, once lipid asymmetry is established, it does not normally dissipate quickly because spontaneous flip-flop of lipids between leaflets is extremely slow.|$|E
25|$|SLE is {{associated}} with defects in <b>apoptotic</b> clearance, and the damaging effects caused by <b>apoptotic</b> debris. Early <b>apoptotic</b> cells express “eat-me” signals, of cell-surface proteins such as phosphatidylserine, that prompt immune cells to engulf them. <b>Apoptotic</b> cells also express “find-me” signals, to attract macrophages and dendritic cells. When <b>apoptotic</b> material is not removed correctly by phagocytes, they are captured instead by antigen-presenting cells, which leads to development of antinuclear antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Fragmentation: The cell breaks apart into {{multiple}} vesicles called <b>apoptotic</b> bodies, which undergo phagocytosis. The {{plasma membrane}} protrusions may help bring <b>apoptotic</b> bodies closer to phagocytes.|$|E
25|$|Blebs on <b>apoptotic</b> cells contain {{nearly all}} the autoantigens found in SLE, and phagocytes bind these <b>apoptotic</b> cells and phagocytose them. If this process is defective, these autoantigens can be {{released}} into the circulation allowing an immune response. Serum amyloid P component is a protein that is thought {{to aid in the}} clearance of chromatin produced by <b>apoptotic</b> cells and deficiencies in this protein have been shown (in mice) to cause spontaneous formation of ANA. Autoantigens present on the blebs of <b>apoptotic</b> cells are also prone to modification, which can increase their immunogenicity.|$|E
25|$|Autoimmunity {{possibly}} {{results by}} the extended exposure to nuclear and intracellular autoantigens derived from late <b>apoptotic</b> and secondary necrotic cells. B and T cell tolerance for <b>apoptotic</b> cells is abrogated, and the lymphocytes get activated by these autoantigens; inflammation {{and the production}} of autoantibodies by plasma cells is initiated. A clearance deficiency in the skin for <b>apoptotic</b> cells has also been observed in people with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE).|$|E
25|$|The {{clearance}} {{of early}} <b>apoptotic</b> cells {{is an important}} function in multicellular organisms. It leads to a progression of the apoptosis process and finally to secondary necrosis of the cells if this ability is disturbed. Necrotic cells release nuclear fragments as potential autoantigens, as well as internal danger signals, inducing maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), since they have lost their membranes' integrity. Increased appearance of <b>apoptotic</b> cells also stimulates inefficient clearance. That leads to maturation of DCs and also to the presentation of intracellular antigens of late <b>apoptotic</b> or secondary necrotic cells, via MHC molecules.|$|E
25|$|There are {{correlations}} between the <b>apoptotic</b> rates of lymphocytes and disease activity.|$|E
25|$|A {{molecular}} {{characteristic of}} metastatic cells is their altered expression of several <b>apoptotic</b> genes.|$|E
25|$|There also {{exists a}} caspase-independent <b>apoptotic</b> pathway that is {{mediated}} by AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor).|$|E
25|$|Cell {{suicide is}} an {{effective}} means of stemming the spread of a pathogen throughout an organism. In <b>apoptotic</b> responses to infection, the contents of an infected cell (including the pathogen) are contained and engulfed by phagocytosis. Some pathogens, such as human cytomegalovirus, express caspase inhibitors that arrest the <b>apoptotic</b> machinery of the host cell. The caspase-independence of necroptosis allows the cell to bypass caspase activation, decreasing the time during which the pathogen can inhabit the cell.|$|E
25|$|An early {{morphological}} {{event in}} both the extrinsic and the intrinsic <b>apoptotic</b> pathways is the surface exposure of the phospholipid phosphatidylserine, about 96% of which normally reside in the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Phosphatidylserine is translocated to the exoplasmic leaflet by the activation of scramblases, leading to pro-coagulant properties and providing a phagocytic signal to the macrophages that engulf and clear the <b>apoptotic</b> cells. The involvement of other associated proteins aiding scrambling activity cannot be ruled out.|$|E
25|$|Aponecrosis is {{a hybrid}} of {{apoptosis}} and necrosis and refers to an incomplete <b>apoptotic</b> process that is completed by necrosis.|$|E
25|$|In apoptosis, {{extrinsic}} signaling via cell surface receptors or intrinsic signaling by {{release of}} cytochrome c from mitochondria leads to caspase activation. Proteolytic {{degradation of the}} cell’s interior culminates with the packaging of the cell’s remains into <b>apoptotic</b> bodies, which are degraded and recycled by phagocytosis. Unlike in apoptosis, necrosis and necroptosis do not involve caspase activation. Necrotic cell death culminates in leakage of cell contents into the extracellular space, {{in contrast to the}} organized disposal of cellular contents into <b>apoptotic</b> bodies.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide is also {{capable of}} binding to {{scavenger}} proteins found on macrophages. Such binding facilitates a macrophage’s {{ability to take}} up <b>apoptotic</b> cells.|$|E
25|$|Tingible body macrophages (TBMs)– large {{phagocytic}} {{cells in}} the germinal centers of secondary lymph nodes– express CD68 protein. These cells normally engulf B cells that have undergone apoptosis after somatic hypermutation. In some people with SLE, significantly fewer TBMs can be found, and these cells rarely contain material from <b>apoptotic</b> B cells. Also, uningested <b>apoptotic</b> nuclei can be found outside of TBMs. This material may present {{a threat to the}} tolerization of B cells and T cells. Dendritic {{cells in the}} germinal center may endocytose such antigenic material and present it to T cells, activating them. Also, <b>apoptotic</b> chromatin and nuclei may attach to the surfaces of follicular dendritic cells and make this material available for activating other B cells that may have randomly acquired self-specificity through somatic hypermutation. Necrosis, a pro-inflammatory form of cell death, is increased in T lymphocytes, due to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and depletion of ATP.|$|E
25|$|As well as cells {{encompassing}} DDR defects, {{they are}} likely to have repressed <b>apoptotic</b> mechanisms which will further enhance the occurrence of mutations and aneuploidy.|$|E
25|$|Activation of the Hedgehog pathway {{leads to}} an {{increase}} in Angiogenic Factors (angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2), Cyclins (cyclin D1 and B1), anti-apoptotic genes and a decrease in <b>apoptotic</b> genes (Fas).|$|E
25|$|HIV {{decreases}} {{the production of}} molecules involved in marking the cell for apoptosis, giving the virus time to replicate and continue releasing <b>apoptotic</b> agents and virions into the surrounding tissue.|$|E
25|$|CRP binds to the phosphocholine {{expressed}} on {{the surface}} of dead or dying cells and some bacteria. This activates the complement system, promoting phagocytosis by macrophages, which clears necrotic and <b>apoptotic</b> cells and bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Apoptosis also {{occurs in}} the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), {{which is also a}} sexually dimorphic area and is located in the periventricular gray area at the rostral extreme of the third ventricle. In {{contrast}} with SDN-POA, AVPV has larger size in females than in males. It is proved that Bcl-2 level in AVPV is higher whereas Bax level is lower in females than in males, just as being opposite of those in MPNc. As indicated in these two cases, <b>apoptotic</b> cell death plays a critical role in the formation of sexually dimorphic nucleus, and the <b>apoptotic</b> cell number within SDN negatively correlates with the volume of SDN between different sexes.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the actual}} process of cell death is precipitated by enzymes, <b>apoptotic</b> signals must cause {{regulatory}} proteins {{to initiate the}} apoptosis pathway. This step allows those signals to cause cell death, or the process to be stopped, should the cell {{no longer need to}} die. Several proteins are involved, but two main methods of regulation have been identified: the targeting of mitochondria functionality, or directly transducing the signal via adaptor proteins to the <b>apoptotic</b> mechanisms. An extrinsic pathway for initiation identified in several toxin studies is an increase in calcium concentration within a cell caused by drug activity, which also can cause apoptosis via a calcium binding protease calpain.|$|E
25|$|Cellular death due to {{necrosis}} {{does not}} follow the <b>apoptotic</b> signal transduction pathway, but rather various receptors are activated, and result {{in the loss of}} cell membrane integrity and an uncontrolled release of products of cell death into the extracellular space.|$|E
25|$|Ciclosporin affects {{mitochondria}} {{by preventing}} the mitochondrial permeability transition pore from opening, thus inhibiting cytochrome c release, a potent <b>apoptotic</b> stimulation factor. This {{is not the}} primary mechanism of action for clinical use, but {{is also an important}} effect for research on apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Membrane blebbing: The cell {{membrane}} shows irregular buds known as blebs. Initially these are smaller surface blebs. Later these can grow into larger so-called dynamic membrane blebs. An important regulator of <b>apoptotic</b> {{cell membrane}} blebbing is ROCK1 (rho associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1).|$|E
25|$|Scramblases are proline-rich proteins, {{possessing}} many cysteinyl sulfhydryl {{groups that}} are prone to modifications. Oxidation, nitrosylation, and blockage of these sulfhydril groups produce an enhanced scramblase activity. Patients with sickle cell disease exhibit a fraction of erythrocytes with an aberrantly enhanced exposure of phosphotidyl serine on their surface. As the erythrocytes of these patients have an enhanced oxidative stress, {{it is probable that}} increased scramblase activity might {{play a role in the}} etiology of the disease. Furthermore, it is well recognized that both reactive oxygen species and intracellular Ca2+ fluxes affect mitochondria at the beginning of the <b>apoptotic</b> program. Sulfhydryl modification of PLSCR3 in mitochondria during apoptosis may be a key regulator initiating the intrinsic <b>apoptotic</b> pathways.|$|E
25|$|<b>Apoptotic</b> {{cell death}} is {{characterized}} by a proteolytic caspase cascade that emanates from either an extrinsic or an intrinsic pathway. The extrinsic pathway is initiated by membrane bound death receptors, leading to activation of caspase 8, whereas the intrinsic pathway is triggered by DNA damaging drugs and UV radiation, leading to mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent activation of caspase 9. PLSCRs are supposed {{to play an important role}} in both intrinsic and extrinsic <b>apoptotic</b> responses that are linked to each other via the activation of caspase 8. Activated caspase 8 causes the cleavage of the amino terminal portion of the cytosolic protein Bid to generate t-Bid that is translocated into mitochondria during apoptosis. hPLSCR1 and its mitochondrial counterpart hPLSCR3 are phosphorylated by PKCδ during PKC-δ-induced apoptosis. While the consequence of hPLSCR1 phosphorylation and its mechanism of action during cellular <b>apoptotic</b> response remain unclear, phosphorylated hPLSCR3 is thought to facilitate mitochondrial targeting of t-Bid that is an essential requirement in caspase 8-mediated apoptosis. The active t-Bid fragment is shown to localize to mitochondria through a positive interaction with cardiolipin. This activated t-Bid induces activation of Bax and Bak proteins to form cytochrome c channels that facilitate the release of cytochrome c during apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Research on {{apoptosis}} {{has increased}} substantially {{since the early}} 1990s. In addition to its importance as a biological phenomenon, defective <b>apoptotic</b> processes have been implicated {{in a wide variety}} of diseases. Excessive apoptosis causes atrophy, whereas an insufficient amount results in uncontrolled cell proliferation, such as cancer.|$|E
25|$|Potential {{protective}} or attenuating agents include GnRH analogs, {{where several}} studies have shown a protective effect in vivo in humans, but some studies show no such effect. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has shown similar effect, but its mechanism of inhibiting the sphingomyelin <b>apoptotic</b> pathway may also interfere with the apoptosis action of chemotherapy drugs.|$|E
25|$|Even {{after the}} initial cause of the {{necrosis}} has been halted, the necrotic tissue {{will remain in the}} body. The body's immune response to apoptosis, which involves the automatic breaking down and recycling of cellular material, is not triggered by necrotic cell death due to the <b>apoptotic</b> pathway being disabled.|$|E
25|$|Viruses {{can remain}} intact from {{apoptosis}} {{in particular in}} the latter stages of infection. They can be exported in the <b>apoptotic</b> bodies that pinch off {{from the surface of}} the dying cell, and the fact that they are engulfed by phagocytes prevents the initiation of a host response. This favours the spread of the virus.|$|E
25|$|The {{intracellular}} signaling {{responses to}} netrin-1 {{are not yet}} well understood, even in neurobiology studies. Several phosphorylation events have been established, as have the involvement of several src family kinases and small GTPases, but {{the sequence of events}} has not yet been determined. DCC is also required to be recruited to lipid rafts for axon outgrowth and <b>apoptotic</b> signaling.|$|E
25|$|After {{transmission}} from a mosquito, {{the viruses}} replicate in {{the lymph nodes}} and infect dendritic cells in particular. From there, they reach the liver and infect hepatocytes (probably indirectly via Kupffer cells), which leads to eosinophilic degradation of these cells and {{to the release of}} cytokines. <b>Apoptotic</b> masses known as Councilman bodies appear in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes.|$|E
25|$|The {{subcellular}} localization of Bok {{protein is}} controversial. In proliferating cells, Bok {{is found in}} the nucleus. Upon induction of apoptosis, it was found to tightly associate with mitochondrial membranes. On the other hand, another group found Bok shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In their experiments, increased nuclear (not mitochondrial) localization correlated with a stronger <b>apoptotic</b> activity.|$|E
