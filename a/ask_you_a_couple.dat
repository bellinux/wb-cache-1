John {{was one of her}} favorite uncles—he’d practically raised her for parts of her childhood and had helped her with her student loans during medical school. Since she’d become a doctor, she noticed he always took a certain pride in introducing her to friends as “My niece, the doctor. ” “What’s going on, Uncle John? ” she asked. “Well Martha, ” he said, “I was wondering if I could <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of questions. ...|$|E
40|$|As part of Unseen Amsterdam 2013 Matthew Murray {{was asked}} to give a {{presentation}} before the screening of his two SKA moving portrait films. The presentation and screening {{were part of the}} The Unseen Living Room Film Screening in association with FOAM Museum for Photography, Amsterdam programme. 'I really like to place people in unfamiliar environments to see how they react, most people know {{what it is like to}} have their photograph taken and how to react. Asking someone to stand and look straight into the lens for a specific length of time while being filmed is completely different though. 'When being photographed people can deal with being uncomfortable for 1 / 125 th of a second or a 1 / 500 th of a second. Filming someone for a minute or two for example, really brings out the character of the sitter, the uncomfortable silence, what should I do, where should I look etc. This approach worked well the the 'Ska' series as people already have a general preconceived idea about skinheads, as stated by Jack who is 21 'I get quite a bit of stick from Nazi Skinheads about the way I look, neither me or the other subjects share their same racist views. ' The moving stills film brings a vulnerability to the subjects that they can't hide from, together with the background sound from traffic passing outside the pub, the dull thud of the Ska music downstairs or the noise of laughing and chatting adds to the isolation of the sitter in an environment. Andy Warhol’s silent screen test of Edie Sedgwick and Bob Dylan and Anton Corbijn’s projections for the Depeche Mode Devotional World Tour in 1993, were real inspirations of how to approach the 'Moving Stills' Portraits. ' Matthew Murray Dear Matthew, I have received your contact information. To start off; we are delighted to have included Ska 1 : 46 and SKA 4 : 03 in this year’s programme of Unseen and we would like thank you for your cooperation. Many thanks for the text on the film, I will make sure this gets to the Unseen editors. In the meantime I would like to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> more questions: - For the Unseen website and online programme we’d like to receive, if possible, an image and the corresponding credits which we can use to promote the screening of the film. Is this something you could send us? - I have understood that you were planning to come to Unseen already, is this correct? You would be welcomed as our VIP guest, so I will ask my colleague Fleur Schoonhoven (Unseen VIP Manager) to send you our VIP schedule. - Furthermore, we’d like to screen the film via a digital file. Would it be possible for you to send me a digital file of the film? [...] FOAM - Amsterda...|$|E

6000|$|There is {{one more}} difficulty--there are two difficulties--and I must <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of minutes. I only need name them--famine and plague. At this moment, when you have thought and argued out all these {{political}} things, the Government of India still remains a grim business. If there are no rains this month, the spectre of famine seems to be approaching, and nobody can blame us for that. Nobody expects the Viceroy and the Secretary of State to play the part of Elijah on Mount Carmel, who prayed and saw a little cloud like a man's hand, until the heavens became black with winds and cloud, {{and there was a}} great rain. That is beyond the reach of Government. All we can say is that never before was the Government in all its branches and members found more ready than it is now, to do the very best to face the prospect. Large suspensions of revenue and rent will be granted, allowances will be made to distressed cultivators. No stone will be left unturned. The plague figures are terrible enough. At this season plague mortality is generally quiescent; but this year, even if the last three months of it show no rise, the plague mortality will still be the worst that has ever been known, I think, in India's recorded annals. Pestilence during the last nine months has stalked through the land, wasting her cities and villages, uncontrolled and uncontrollable, so far as we can tell, by human forethought or care. When I read some of these figures in the House of Commons, a few perturbed cries of [...] "Shame" [...] accompanied them. These cries came from the natural sympathy, horror, amazement, and commiseration, with which we all listen to such ghastly stories. The shame does not lie with the Government. If you see anything in your newspapers about these plague figures, remember that they are not like an epidemic here. In trying to remedy plague, you have to encounter the habits and prejudices of hundreds of years. Suppose you find plague is conveyed by a flea upon a rat, and suppose you are dealing with a population who object to the taking away of life. You see for yourselves the difficulty? The Government of India have applied themselves with great energy, with fresh activity, and they believe they have got the secret of this fell disaster. They have laid down a large policy of medical, sanitary, and financial aid. I am a hardened niggard of public money. I watch the expenditure of Indian revenue as the ferocious dragon of the old mythology watched the golden apples. I do not forget that I come from a constituency which, so far as I have known it, if it is most generous, is also most prudent. Nevertheless, though I have to be thrifty, almost parsimonious, upon this matter, the Council of India and myself will, I am sure, not stint or grudge. I can only say, in conclusion, that I think I have said enough to convince you that I am doing what I believe you would desire me to do--conducting administration in the spirit which I believe you will approve; listening with impartiality to all I can learn; desirous to support all those who are toiling at arduous work in India; and that we shall not be deterred from pursuing to the end, a policy of firmness on the one hand, and of liberal and steady reform on the other. We shall not see all the fruits of it in our day. So be it. We shall at least have made not only a beginning, but a marked advance both in order and progress, by resolute patience, and an unflagging spirit of conciliation.|$|R
