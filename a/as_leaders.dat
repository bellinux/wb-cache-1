5|$|<b>As</b> <b>leaders</b> in {{the punk}} rock scene, the Ramones' music has usually been {{identified}} with that label, while some have defined their characteristic style more specifically as pop punk {{and others as}} power pop.

5|$|The {{position}} of cardinal is a rank of honour bestowed by popes on certain clergy, such <b>as</b> <b>leaders</b> within the Roman Curia, bishops serving {{in major cities}} and distinguished theologians. For advice and assistance in governing, the pope may turn to the College of Cardinals.|$|E
5|$|Abd al-Rahman at {{this time}} was a {{flamboyant}} figure with broad popular support. His stature served to diminish that of the politicians, who were seen as his followers rather than <b>as</b> <b>leaders.</b> Abd al-Rahman could not afford a sudden British withdrawal, since that would {{open the door for}} an Egyptian take-over and the loss of his power. The British also were against an Egyptian take-over, but for different reasons. Yet Abd al-Rahman could not be seen as supporting an indefinite colonial status, and continued to promote independence. Abd al-Rahman and the British were engaged in delicate and unstable arrangements characterized by mutual distrust.|$|E

5|$|Disagreement {{over who}} {{would lead the}} 10,000 Chetnik exiles in Italy {{escalated}} into a feud between Jevđević, Đujić and General Miodrag Damjanović in mid-1947. Damjanović had been appointed by Mihailović in March 1945 to lead the Chetniks into northwestern Italy. Jevđević and Đujić refused to accept this and claimed that they were Mihailović's only successors <b>as</b> <b>leaders</b> of the Chetnik movement.|$|E

5|$|The {{notion of}} kingship in Europe {{ultimately}} originates in systems of tribal kingship in prehistoric Europe. The Minoan (c. 3200 – c. 1400 BCE) and Mycenaean civilisation (c. 1600 – c. 1100 BCE) provide the earliest examples of monarchies in protohistoric Greece. Thanks to the decipherment of the Linear B script in 1952, much knowledge has been acquired about {{society in the}} Mycenaean realms, where the kings functioned <b>as</b> <b>leaders</b> of palace economies. The role of kings changed in the following Greek Dark Ages (c. 1100 – c. 750 BCE) to big gentleman farmers with military power.|$|E

50|$|To date a {{total of}} twelve people (all men) have served <b>as</b> <b>Leader</b> of the Opposition - over twice the number who have served as Premier or Chief Minister. Every person who has served as Chief Minister or Premier has also served <b>as</b> <b>Leader</b> of the Opposition at some point. No person has ever served {{consecutive}} terms <b>as</b> <b>Leader</b> of the Opposition. On two occasions has the Leader of the Opposition changed between elections: in 1977 (when Austin Henley died), and in 1988 (when Ralph O'Neal left the United Party to join the Government). In 2014 Julian Fraser replaced Ralph O'Neal <b>as</b> <b>leader</b> of the Virgin Islands Party, but did not formally take over his role <b>as</b> <b>Leader</b> of the Opposition.|$|R
5|$|The {{role of the}} Judenrats {{has been}} controversial. Both Raul Hilberg and Hannah Arendt, early historians of the Holocaust, argued that {{without the help of}} the Judenrats, the Germans would have been {{hampered}} in their extermination efforts. Arendt went further and condemned those Jews who served <b>as</b> <b>leaders</b> in the ghettos for helping destroy their own people. More recent historians have recognized that the situation facing the Jewish leaders was more complex – they faced conflicting sets of goals and had essentially no power to change the demands the Germans made of them.|$|E

The medal was presented to his widow at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, D.C.. Four weeks after the mission, the arclights and Operation Strangle were abandoned, <b>as</b> <b>leaders</b> felt the risks and casualties of the operation outweighed the benefits.|$|E

5|$|Clan Maclachlan claims {{descent from}} Lachlan Mor, {{who lived on}} the shores of Loch Fyne in the 13th century. Lachlan belonged to the family who {{originally}} emigrated from Ireland to Scotland in the 11th century. The progenitor of this family, Anrothan, son of Aodh O'Neil, king of the north of Ireland, is said to have married the heiress of the King of Scots and gained lands campaigning there. Moncreiffe wrote that it was more likely Anrothan married a daughter of the local king of Argyll or a sub-king of Cowal and through this marriage, Anrothan's descendants gained control of the lands of Knapdale and Cowal, and several Scottish clans claim a descent from him including Clan MacNeil of Barra, Clan Lamont, Clan MacEwen of Otter, and the MacSweens who became the Irish Sweeney Clan who left Scotland and returned to Ireland in the 14th century <b>as</b> <b>leaders</b> of Gallowglass.|$|E
5|$|The Bergen Arches Expressway was {{proposed}} in 1989 by Governor Thomas Kean {{to connect the}} Jersey City waterfront with a new railroad line, which would provide access to the Meadowlands Sports Complex. This four-lane road was to follow an abandoned railroad line known as the Bergen Arches. This proposed highway was strongly supported by Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler, who felt that the road could bring further development, {{as well as provide}} traffic relief to the four-lane Route139. In 1998, this project was allocated $26million in the federal Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. Both Jersey City mayor candidates in 2001 supported a transit line instead of a highway along the Bergen Arches. Plans for a highway along the Bergen Arches were dropped in 2002 <b>as</b> <b>leaders</b> of Jersey City, including Mayor Glenn Dale Cunningham, favored mass transit.|$|E
5|$|The Manhattan Project {{intelligence}} staff {{believed that}} the Japanese atomic program was not far advanced because Japan had little access to uranium ore, the industrial effort required exceeded Japan's capacity, and, according to American physicists at the University of California, Berkeley, who knew the leading Japanese physicists personally, there were too few Japanese qualified {{to work in the}} area. Conversely, German scientists had reputations <b>as</b> <b>leaders</b> in the field, and the fear of Germany developing nuclear weapons first {{was one of the reasons}} for the establishment of the Manhattan Project. The Chancellor of Germany, Adolf Hitler, frequently claimed that Germany was developing secret weapons, and it was feared that these might include nuclear weapons. Reports of German nuclear activity were taken very seriously. At the instigation of the Manhattan Project, Norwegian saboteurs and Allied bombers attacked heavy-water infrastructure in German-occupied Norway in late 1942 and early 1943.|$|E

5|$|The first {{permanent}} {{white settlers}} of South Bend were fur traders who established trading {{posts in the}} area. In 1820, Pierre Frieschutz Navarre arrived, representing the American Fur Company (AFC) of John Jacob Astor. He settled near what is now downtown South Bend. Alexis Coquillard, another agent of the AFC, established a trading post known as the Big St. Joseph Station. In 1827, Lathrop Minor Taylor established a post for Samuel Hanna and Company, in whose records the name St. Joseph's, Indiana was used. By 1829, the town was growing, with Coquillard and Taylor emerging <b>as</b> <b>leaders.</b> They applied for a post office. Taylor was appointed postmaster, and the post office was designated as Southold, Allen County, Indiana. The following year, the name was changed to South Bend, probably to ease confusion, as several other communities were named Southold at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{significance}} of the APEC summit called for stringent and expensive security arrangements. The Protective Security Coordination Centre, of the National Security and Criminal Justice Group from the Australian Attorney-General's Department, oversaw security planning through the APEC 2007 Security Branch, formed expressly for the APEC meetings. In order to secure and monitor the summit, the New South Wales Police Force instituted the APEC Police Security Command. Many public roads in Sydney were closed, <b>as</b> <b>leaders,</b> officials, and personnel travelled in motorcades around the city centre. Figures released by the state government at a Senate committee hearing show that security measures at APEC cost $170million.|$|E
