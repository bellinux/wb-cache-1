5|$|HD 154672 b is {{a closely}} {{orbiting}} planet that {{is larger than}} Jupiter. Its mass was estimated as 5.02 that of Jupiter. HD 154672 b also orbits its host star <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> of 0.6 AU every 163.91 days. Earth, in comparison, orbits the Sun <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> of 1 AU every 365.25 days. However, HD 154672 b has an orbital eccentricity of 0.61, which indicates a very elliptical orbit. Because HD 154672 b has such an eccentric orbit, the equilibrium temperature of the planet varies between 300 K and 600 K, which is significantly {{higher than that of}} Jupiter (124 K). If liquid water is present in the atmosphere of HD 154672 b, it could possibly convert between gaseous and liquid phases as the planet moves along its orbit.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, {{a planet}} {{was found by}} the Anglo-Australian Planet Search team to be {{orbiting}} the star in a very eccentric orbit.

The planet orbits its star <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> of approximately two AU away; the planet Earth, in comparison, orbits <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> of one AU away from the Sun. HD 2039 b's discovery was reported quietly; no press release was provided by the observatory that discovered the star's planet, and no formal announcement of the planet's existence was made.
