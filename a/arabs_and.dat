5|$|Debates {{over the}} origin of falafel have {{sometimes}} devolved into political discussions {{about the relationship between}} <b>Arabs</b> <b>and</b> Israelis. In modern times, falafel has been considered a national dish of Egypt, Palestine, and of Israel. Resentment exists amongst many Palestinians for {{what they see as the}} appropriation of their dish by Israelis. Additionally, the Lebanese Industrialists' Association has raised assertions of copyright infringement against Israel concerning falafel.|$|E

5|$|The lack {{of success}} {{exacerbated}} the tensions between the Muslims, leading to the rebellion of the Palermitans in 886 and again in 890, as manifold divisions—between the <b>Arabs</b> <b>and</b> Berbers, between the Sicilians and the Ifriqiyans, and between Palermitans and Arigentans—came to the fore. A full-scale civil war between <b>Arabs</b> <b>and</b> Berbers erupted in 898, and was not ended until Ibrahim II's son Abu'l-Abbas Abdallah captured Palermo in 900. Abdallah also won a string of victories against the Byzantines, until he was recalled to Ifriqiya to replace his father; Ibrahim then came to Sicily {{with a group of}} volunteers, and captured the last major Byzantine stronghold, Taormina, in August 902. Although a few strongholds in the northeast remained unconquered and in Christian hands up to the fall of Rometta in 965, the fall of Taormina marked the effective end of Byzantine Sicily, and the consolidation of Muslim control over the island.|$|E
5|$|According to Ottoman {{statistics}} {{studied by}} Justin McCarthy, {{the population of}} Palestine in the early 19th century was 350,000, in 1860 it was 411,000 and in 1900 about 600,000 of whom 94% were Arabs. In 1914 Palestine had a population of 657,000 Muslim Arabs, 81,000 Christian <b>Arabs,</b> <b>and</b> 59,000 Jews. McCarthy estimates the non-Jewish population of Palestine at 452,789 in 1882; 737,389 in 1914; 725,507 in 1922; 880,746 in 1931; and 1,339,763 in 1946.|$|E

5|$|According to an {{academic}} study, people {{perceived to be}} Middle Eastern were {{as likely to be}} victims of hate crimes as followers of Islam during this time. The study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against people who may have been perceived as Muslims, <b>Arabs,</b> <b>and</b> others thought to be of Middle Eastern origin. A report by the South Asian American advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together, documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent between September 11 and 17. Various crimes such as vandalism, arson, assault, shootings, harassment, and threats in numerous places were documented.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 17, Mercury and {{his family}} fled from Zanzibar for safety reasons due to the 1964 Zanzibar Revolution, in which {{thousands}} of <b>Arabs</b> <b>and</b> Indians were killed. The family moved into a small house at 22 Gladstone Avenue, Feltham, Middlesex, England. Mercury enrolled at Isleworth Polytechnic (now West Thames College) in West London where he studied art.

A British citizen at birth, Mercury remained so {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
5|$|Firearms {{remained}} {{in use in}} China throughout the following centuries. Meanwhile, gunpowder and firearms spread elsewhere very quickly. Gunpowder {{seems to have been}} widely known by the 13th century. The Europeans, <b>Arabs,</b> <b>and</b> Koreans all obtained firearms in the 14th century. The Turks, Iranians, and Indians all got firearms no later than the 15th century, in each case directly or indirectly from the Europeans. The Japanese did not acquire firearms until the 16th century, and then from the Portuguese rather than the Chinese.|$|E
30|$|Collectively considered, {{there is}} {{evidence}} of extraordinary stigmatization of <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Islamic Americans during the post- 9 / 11 period. Aggressive federal policies made young <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Islamic males subject to strong criminal suspicion and adverse legal treatment. Social interactions displayed a discrete and large scale increase in intolerance as anti-Muslim hate crimes rose to historical highs and never fully returned to pre- 9 / 11 levels. After the attacks of September 11, 2001 there was an increase in the wage penalty associated with being a person of <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Islamic descent, along with evidence of some deterioration in employment among very young males <b>and</b> evidence that <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Islamic men were pushed out of high wage industries into low wage industries. These outcomes suggest the formation of an economy with a lower payoff to acculturation for <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Islamic Americans: in comparison to the pre- 9 / 11 era, <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Islamic Americans {{were less likely to be}} accepted as white and were less likely to opt for a white identity rather than a non-white identity.|$|R

30|$|We {{check for}} unobserved {{cultural}} bias by restricting our sample to elderly persons, that is, persons age 65 and above. Compared to otherwise identical school-age and working-age persons, elderly persons {{have a stronger}} cultural attachment to <b>Arab</b> identity <b>and</b> Islamic religion than their younger counter-parts (Elver [2012]). Elderly <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Islamic Americans are subjected to the same or higher unobserved cultural influences as younger <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Islamic Americans, but elderly persons have much less incentive to change their racial identity selection, to change their behaviors and actions, or {{to move to another}} location in response to exogenous changes in the racial environment. Moreover, native-born elderly <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Islamic Americans are more invested in the dominant racial identity (white) than either younger or immigrant elderly <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Islamic Americans.|$|R
5|$|In the 19th century, Thomas John Newbold, an English soldier {{working for}} the East India Company, {{estimated}} the population of Kuala Terengganu to be around 15,000 to 20,000 Malays with 600 Chinese, but it was presumably an overestimation. There were few brick buildings in the town. The principal brick buildings were a mosque and a custom house. Most of the houses were made of wood and thatch. The Chinese settlement in Kuala Terengganu, Kampung Cina, had become an old and established settlement. Most of the houses and shops in Kampung Cina were made of stone and brick. There were also {{a considerable number of}} <b>Arabs</b> <b>and</b> their descendant in Kuala Terengganu.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of Basil I's reign, Arab raids on the coasts of Dalmatia were {{successfully}} repelled, and the region once again came under secure Byzantine control. This enabled Byzantine missionaries to penetrate to the interior and convert the Serbs and the principalities of modern-day Herzegovina and Montenegro to Orthodox Christianity. An attempt to retake Malta ended disastrously, however, when the local population sided with the <b>Arabs</b> <b>and</b> massacred the Byzantine garrison.|$|E
5|$|Near Lejjun, {{the remains}} of the ancient {{fortress}} of Megiddo on Tell al Mutesellim dominate the entry to the plain from the Musmus Pass. Here a relatively small garrison could control the routes across the Esdraelon Plain where the armies of Egyptians, Romans, Mongols, <b>Arabs,</b> <b>and</b> Crusaders who had fought Saladin near Afulah during the Battle of Al-Fule, as well as of Napoleon, had marched and fought towards Nazareth, the Galilean Hills, and Damascus.|$|E
30|$|A one {{percentage}} point increase in hate crimes yields a 9 % increase in the relative odds that <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Islamic Americans will select a non-white racial identity. The stability of this coefficient across all three samples suggests that although individuals represented by the DOJ sample were subjected to greater governmental legal activity than other <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Islamic Americans, the post- 9 / 11 national environment reduced incentives to acculturate for all <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Islamic Americans.|$|R

During 1999 - 2004, the relative natural log of wages for <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Muslims declined by 0.09 points, though this difference {{had only a}} 10 % level of significance.

5|$|Shaizar {{was seen}} as a {{strategically}} important site and the gateway to enter and control inner Syria. The Arabs initially conquered Shaizar during the Muslim conquest of the Levant in 637. Due to its importance it exchanged hands numerous times between the <b>Arabs</b> <b>and</b> Byzantines, who regained it in 999. In 1025 the Banu Munqid tribe were given an allocation of land beside Shaizar by the ruler of Hama, Saleh al-Murdase. Over time they expanded their lands building fortifications and castles until Usamas grandfather Iz Al-Dawlah Al-Murhif Nasr retook it in 1180.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} Muḥammad used the term Allah in addressing both pagan <b>Arabs</b> <b>and</b> Jews or Christians {{in order to establish}} a common ground for the understanding of the name for God, a claim Gerhard Böwering says is doubtful. According to Böwering, in contrast with pre-Islamic Arabian polytheism, God in Islam does not have associates and companions, nor is there any kinship between God and jinn. Pre-Islamic pagan Arabs believed in a blind, powerful, inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God.|$|E
