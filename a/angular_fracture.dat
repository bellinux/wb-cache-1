6000|$|Evidence {{more or less}} {{distinct}} of {{a change}} of level between the land and water, has been detected on almost all the land {{on this side of}} the globe. Captain Grey, and other travellers, have found in Southern Australia upraised shells, belonging either to the recent, or to a late tertiary period. The French naturalists in Baudin's expedition, found shells similarly circumstanced on the S.W. coast of Australia. The Rev. W.B. Clarke finds proofs of the elevation of the land, to the amount of 400 feet, at the Cape of Good Hope. ("Proceedings of the Geological Society" [...] volume 3 page 420.) In the neighbourhood of the Bay of Islands in New Zealand, I observed that the shores were scattered to some height, as at Van Diemen's Land, with sea-shells, which the colonists attribute to the natives. (I will here give a catalogue of the rocks which I met with near the Bay of Islands, in New Zealand:--1st, Much basaltic lava, and scoriform rocks, forming distinct craters;--2nd, A castellated hill of horizontal strata of flesh-coloured limestone, showing when fractured distinct crystalline facets: the rain has acted on this rock in a remarkable manner, corroding its surface into a miniature model of an Alpine country: I observed here layers of chert and clay ironstone; and in the bed of a stream, pebbles of clay-slate;--3rd, The shores of the Bay of Islands are formed of a feldspathic rock, of a bluish-grey colour, often much decomposed, with an <b>angular</b> <b>fracture,</b> and crossed by numerous ferruginous seams, but without any distinct stratification or cleavage. Some varieties are highly crystalline, and would at once be pronounced to be trap; others strikingly resembled clay-slate, slightly altered by heat: I was unable to form any decided opinion on this formation.) Whatever may have been the origin of these shells, I cannot doubt, after having seen a section of the valley of the Thames River (37 degrees S.), drawn by the Rev. W. Williams, that the land has been there elevated: on the opposite sides of this great valley, three step-like terraces, composed of an enormous accumulation of rounded pebbles, exactly correspond with each other: the escarpment of each terrace is about fifty feet in height. No one after having examined the terraces in the valleys on the western shores of South America, which are strewed with sea-shells, and have been formed during intervals of rest in the slow elevation of the land, could doubt that the New Zealand terraces have been similarly formed. I may add, that Dr. Dieffenbach, in his description of the Chatham Islands ("Geographical Journal" [...] volume 11 pages 202, 205.) (S.W. of New Zealand), states that it is manifest [...] "that the sea has left many places bare which were once covered by its waters." ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{elaborate}} a model in the rat permitting analysis of bone modeling to correct fracture deformity. Among conceivable regulators of this process, the study focused on the peripheral nervous system by analyzing markers of regenerating (GAP- 43), mature (PGP 9. 5) and sensory (CGRP) nerve fibers at the fracture site. CGRP has been suggested to be a potent promotor of bone formation through stimulation of osteoblasts and inhibition of osteoclasts. A total of 113 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups with tibial fracture and one control group with intact tibia. Mid-shaft fracture was produced by three-point manual bending and fixed with an intramedullary nail in either straight alignment, posterior (31 degrees) or anterior angulation (27 degrees), thereby creating a convex and a concave side of the diaphyseal fracture in the two latter groups. Fracture heating and modeling were assessed by serial radiography, histology, immunohistochemistry and bone mineral uptake studies. During the experimental period of 98 days the rats were allowed free weight bearing. Radiography showed that the fracture callus rapidly became greater on the concave side compared to the convex in both the anterior and posterior angulation group. The callus thickness reached a peak at day 21 post fracture and from day 21 to 35 it decreased significantly on the convex side reflecting resorption. Complete fracture healing was observed at day 35. Analysis of the fracture angulation over time showed that it was corrected from 27 to 11 degreesmost of which was achieved already during the first 21 days after fracture. The adaptive changes in the proximal growth plate resulted in an 8 degrees correctional tilt of the epiphysis. In contrast to previous reports, our findings clearly reflect that most spontaneous correction of <b>angular</b> <b>fracture</b> deformity occurs in the diaphysis instead of the growth plate and notably, quite early during healing, not afterwards. This was confirmed by bone mineral uptake studies showing intense mineralization, i. e., bone formation, from day 7 to 35 on the concave side of the fracture, while on the convex side bone resorption predominated. Site-specific differences in local bone turnover, e. g., to correct <b>angular</b> <b>fracture</b> deformity, may prove to be orchestrated by the peripheral nervous system. Therefore, neuronal immunohistochemistry was applied to the tissues. Fracture of tibia was found to elicit a tremendous increase in nerve immunoreactivity. GAP- 43 and CGRP positive nerve fibers were detected already on day 3 in the fracture hematoma, between day 7 and 14 also in avascular fibrocartilaginous callus and woven bone. The first PGP 9. 5 fibers were seen on day 7. Semi-quantitative analysis showed a peak in neuronal CGRP immunoreactivity on day 21 representing a 38 fold increase in anterior angulation fracture and 27 fold increase in straight alignment fracture as compared to intact tibia. Comparison of the two opposing sides of anterior angulation fracture, disclosed a significant increase in CGRP immunoreactivity on the concave side coinciding with the inflammatory and early modeling phase of healing. In conclusion, angular tibial fracture in the rat elicits site-specific differences in bone formation and bone resorption within the same bone. Correction of fracture deformity by modeling occurs early, concomitantly with healing. The model proposed offers new possibilities to analyse pertinent regulators of local bone turnover. The occurrence of the "bone promoting" neuropeptide CGRP is strongly increased in fracture healing and modeling. The overwhelming predominance of CGRP nerve fibers on the concave side compared to the convex side in <b>angular</b> <b>fracture</b> suggests an important role of the peripheral nervous system in correcting diaphyseal fracture deformity by modeling...|$|E
40|$|It is {{proposed}} that fault textures in two dissected rhyolitic conduits in Iceland preserve evidence for shallow seismogenic faulting within rising magma during the emplacement of highly viscous lava flows. Detailed field and petrographic analysis of such textures may {{shed light on}} the origin of long-period and hybrid volcanic earthquakes at active volcanoes. There is evidence at each conduit investigated for multiple seismogenic cycles, each of which involved four distinct evolutionary phases. In phase 1, shear fracture of unrelaxed magma was triggered by shear stress accumulation during viscous flow, forming the <b>angular</b> <b>fracture</b> networks that initiated faulting cycles. Transient pressure gradients were generated as the fractures opened, which led to fluidisation and clastic deposition of fine-grained particles that were derived from the fracture walls by abrasion. Fracture networks then progressively coalesced and rotated during subsequent slip (phase 2), developing into cataclasite zones with evidence for multiple localised slip events, fluidisation and grain size reduction. Phase 2 textures closely resemble those formed on seismogenic tectonic faults characterised by friction-controlled stick-slip behaviour. Increasing cohesion of cataclasites then led to aseismic, distributed ductile deformation (phase 3) and generated deformed cataclasite zones, which are enriched in metallic oxide microlites and resemble glassy pseudotachylite. Continued annealing and deformation eventually erased all structures in the cataclasite and formed microlite-rich flow bands in obsidian (phase 4). Overall, the mixed brittle-ductile textures formed in the magma appear similar to those formed in lower crustal rocks close to the brittle-ductile transition, with the rheological response mediated by strain-rate variations and frictional heating. Fault processes in highly viscous magma are compared with those elsewhere in the crust, and this comparison is used to appraise existing models of volcano seismic activity. Based on the textures observed, it is suggested that patterns of long-period and hybrid earthquakes at silicic lava domes reflect friction-controlled stick-slip movement and eventual healing of fault zones in magma, which are an accelerated and smaller-scale analogue of tectonic faults...|$|E

The trioctahedral illite {{was derived from}} biotite, and its development through various tages of weathering was followed by optical and electron microscopy combined with electron microanalysis. In {{the initial stages of}} weath-ering, Fe 2 + within biotite was oxidized, without he loss of much K. During this process, biotite flakes became slightly buckled and fractured.

The extent of exfoliation and alteration continued until thinner and shorter segments consisted almost wholly of thin (< 0. 25 ~tm), parallel wafers separated by less compact layers of particles and microaggregates. The segments finally lost their shape and divided into day-size particles. Parts of the thin wafers had the same chemical composition (and structure) as the original, intact flakes of oxidized biotite. The same parts of wafers retained some of the optical properties of the original biotite, and, when broken down to clay, they produced the XRD spacings of 10 and 1. 54 /k, typical of fine-grained, trioctahedral mica (illite) ...|$|R

40|$|In Paper I, {{packing of}} {{colloidal}} particles is simulated in three-dimensions. Colloidal particles in each cluster are condensed from space towards their center. Clusters are then {{moved toward the}} center of agglomerates. The particle rearrangement process during or after condensation is simulated by moving each particle into a more stable position. Particle clusters rearranged during packing have higher packing density and average coordination number than particle clusters rearranged after packing. The effect of particle rearrangement on the packing density in a cluster is comparable to the effect of cluster rearrangement in the cluster agglomeration;In Paper II, agglomeration of colloidal particles in a suspension is simulated using the concepts of interparticle potential fields. Colloid particles move during agglomeration in the direction which decreases the potential energies between particles. Simulated conditions are based on experimental results and on agglomeration theory. The effects of the various types of potential curves between colloidal particles were checked. It was found that short- and long-range fields contribute to the agglomeration process under typical default conditions. Strong short range attractive energy without a repulsive energy barrier makes small strong clusters with hard contacts between particles but weak short-range force with a large repulsive energy barrier makes big agglomerates with soft contacts between particles;In Paper III, settling of colloidal particles was studied with a three-dimensional computer simulation technique. Special attention was paid to the metastable state, rearrangement, and network stress build-up during or after colloidal particle settling. The settling density through the whole process was checked and compared with experimental results. There is a big difference in packing density between particles settled with and without rearrangement. Internal sediment stresses and fracture energies of the settled colloidal powders were calculated. Stress condensation in a simulated powder compact by internal sediment stresses shows good approximation to the network compression stage of powder settling experiments. In a vertical distribution of fracture energy several minima are observed along the height of the particle compact which may cause laminar cracks in subsequent drying processes. Abrupt changes in the fracture energy become smoother with particle rearrangement. <b>Angular</b> <b>fracture</b> energy becomes more isotropic with rearrangement. Low density regions were observed in the settled powder compact near the corner of a tilted box and this is mainly due to the bridging of particles...|$|E

These rocks have an obscure, concretionary structure, and are full of variously coloured angular pseudo fragments. These angular pseudo fragments consist of the first-described dark green rock, of a brown softer kind, of serpentine, and of a yellowish harsh stone, which, perhaps, is related to serpentine rock. There are other vesicular, calcareo-ferruginous, soft stones.

40|$|AbstractOver {{the past}} 3 decades, Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) {{instruments}} {{have become an}} important part of the armamentarium for shaping phase of root canal treatment. NiTi endodontic files have increased flexibility and strength compared with stainless steel instruments, but they seem to be vulnerable to fracture in clinical situations. Many variables might contribute to file separation, but the 2 main causes are cyclic fatigue and torsional stress. Heat treatment (thermal processing) is one of the most fundamental approaches toward adjusting the transition temperatures of NiTi alloys and affecting the fatigue and torsional resistance of NiTi endodontic files. In recent years, novel thermo-mechanical processing and manufacturing technologies such as controlled memory wire (CM-wire), M-Wire and electrical discharge machining (EDM) have been developed to optimize the microstructure of NiTi alloys and their mechanical properties. Aim of this work was to investigate the torsional resistance (maximum torque load, and angular rotation) of NiTi instruments made by different thermo-mechanical and manufacturing processes. One-hundred new Hyflex EDM One- File (# 25 / 0. 08, CM-wire and EDM process), WaveOne Primary (# 25 / 0. 08, M-wire), ProTaper Next X 2 (# 25 / 0. 06, M-wire), Hyflex CM (# 25 / 0. 06, CM-wire) and F 6 SkyTaper(# 25 / 0. 06, conventional NiTi) files were used. Torque and angle of rotation at failure of new instruments (n = 20) were measured using a torsiometer according to ISO 3630 - 1 for each brand. Data were analyzed using the analysis of variance test and the Student- Newman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons. The fracture surface of each fragment was examined with a scanning electron microscope. Files made by CM wire size # 25, 0. 06 taper (Hyflex CM) showed same torque load and <b>angular</b> rotation to <b>fracture</b> than conventional NiTi (F 6 SkyTaper) (P >. 05); instead CM files (manufacturing by grinding or EDM process) recorded lower maximum torque load (P. 05) but significantly higher angular rotation (P <. 05) to fracture than M-wire instruments size # 25, 0. 06 taper (ProTaper Next). Hyflex EDM One-File and Hyflex CM have same torque load and <b>angular</b> rotation to <b>fracture</b> than F 6 SkyTaper due to the higher flexibility and cross-sectional area of CM files tested than conventional NiTi one. Moreover CM files showed lower torque load and higher <b>angular</b> rotation to <b>fracture</b> than M-wire instruments due to the flexibility of CM alloy.

Ocean Drilling Program Leg 188 drilled Site 1166 on the Prydz Bay continental shelf, Antarctica, to document onset and fluctuations of East-Antarctic glaciation. This site recovered Upper Pliocene-Holocene glacial sediments directly above Cretaceous through Lower Oligocene sediments recording the transition from preglacial to early glacial conditions. SEM analysis of quartz grains at Site 1166 was used to characterize the glacial and preglacial sediments by their diagnostic textures. Angular edges, edge abrasion as well as arcuate to straight steps, are the most frequent features in glacial deposits. The highest frequency of grains with round edges is present in Middle-Late Eocene fluvio-deltaic sands. However, <b>angular</b> outlines, <b>fractured</b> plates with subparallel linear fractures and edge abrasion indicating glacier influence are also present. Preglacial carbonaceous mudstone and laminated gray claystone show distinctive high relief quartz grains and some chemical weathering on grain surfaces.

40|$|Using a {{combination}} of Fourier shape analysis and scanning electron microscopy, very fine quartz sand grains from sediments of the Feni and Gardar drifts (Holes 610 A and 611 A) were analyzed to obtain provenance information. Three grain populations were defined: (1) smooth: grains covered with fine-grained silica plastering, interpreted as weathered from continental bedrock; (2) intermediate: <b>angular,</b> freshly <b>fractured</b> grains, probably transported by glaciers and ice-rafting; and (3) irregular: grains covered with irregular, platy silica overgrowths, likely the products of submarine ero-sion of fine-grained marine sediments. Examination of the proportions of each grain type in samples from intervals in-terpreted to be glacial (dark, calcareous muds) and interglacial (light-colored calcareous oozes) showed that there are changes in provenance across the boundaries between these intervals. Proportions of each grain type vary widely within glacial intervals, but remain relatively invariant in inter glacials. This suggests that factors affecting provenance, such {{as the amount of}} sea ice, water depth on the continental shelf, and strength and direction of bottom currents, are more variable during glacial periods.

A distribuição espacial das feições morfoestruturais evidenciou zonas com diferentes características do ponto de vista tectônico e de carstificação. Além disso, há evidências de que as principais drenagens daárea são controladas por fraturamentos. Estatisticamente as fraturas que mais ocorrem na área são as longitudinais com azimutes de 30 a 40 graus e as angulares com azimutes de 110 a 120 graus. As fraturas associadas às dolinas mais freqüentes são as angulares orientadas entre 10 a 20 ou 110 a 120 graus e as transversais com azimutes entre 140 e 150 graus. As fraturas longitudinais propiciam a instalação de um carste mais raso enquanto a carstificação ao longo das fraturas angulares e tranversais atingiu maiores profundidades. Verificou-se também, que os níveis de carstificação não estão relacionados, de uma maneira geral, com o comprimento das fraturas ou ao tamanho das dolinas.

Morphostructural, hydrogeological and hydrochemical {{techniques were}} applied {{in this study}} to characterize the groundwater system of the Jaíba Karst aquifer and its potencial for exploration and utilization as water supply to {{northern part of the}} state of Minas Gerais. These techniques allowed as the study of the spacial distribution and frequency of some morphological features, such as fractures and sinkholes as well as the regional behavior of dimens ional and hydrodynamic parameters of the aquifer. From {{the point of view of}} tectonics and karstification, the spacial distribution of the morphological features exhibit zones with different characteristics. It was also seem that the level of karstification is generally independent of the length of the fractures and of the size of the sinkholes. Is addition, there is evidence that the drainage of the principal streams is controlled by geological fracturing. Statiscally, the most frequently occurring fractures are longitudinal with azimuths from 30 up to 40 degrees and <b>angular</b> <b>fractures</b> with azimuths from 110 up to 120 degrees. The fractures frequently associeted with sinkholes are angular (10 up to 20 and 110 up to 120 degrees) and transversal, with azimuths between 140 and 150 degrees. The longitudinal fractures allowed a more shallow karst development while the karstification along the <b>angular</b> and transversal <b>fractures</b> was deeper.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Backbeach {{deflation}} aprons are heterogeneous, coarse clastic deposits {{associated with}} active transverse dune fields. The apron comprises variously <b>angular,</b> rounded, <b>fractured,</b> cracked, polished, and ventifacted clasts of bedrock (local and exotic), beachrock, and bioherm fragments (coral and worm reef). Terrestrial and anthropogenic clasts (from archeological sites, deflated dunes, flotsam, and shipwrecks) are also present. The unit forms as a lag deposit {{on top of}} a gently sloping (ca. 0. 008), planar sandy deflation surface and is typically only one clast thick. It is up to 100 m wide and extends for tens of kilometers along the coast. It is replaced landward by a steep (ca. 0. 1) deflated soil surface armored with a layer of iron concretions. Backbeach deflation aprons are compound deposits that result from marine storm, eolian, and human activity since the mid-Holocene. The depositional model proposed involves periodic storm deposition of coarse clasts (of beachrock, bedrock, and biogenic origin) and flotsam (shipwreck and other floating debris) on the backbeach or dunes. Some clasts are deposited directly into interdune depressions and enter the deflation plain immediately. Others are deposited initially on dune surfaces. Dune migration results in winnowing of the storm-deposited coarse clasts (together with rhizoliths and any other coarse material in the dune) until they come to rest on the deflation surface. The lag deposit is subsequently buried and uncovered multiple times by dune migration, during which time it is exposed to polishing and subaerial weathering. Consequently, the lag comprises a variety of materials that reflect both storm and eolian processes. The clasts exhibit variable degrees of rounding, polishing, an...|$|R
