60|$|One {{argument}} {{strikes me}} {{in favour of}} the tenet of Apostolic succession, in the ordination of Bishops and Presbyters, as taught by the Church of Rome, and by the larger part of the earlier divines of the Church of England, which I have not seen {{in any of the}} books on this subject; namely, that in strict analogy with other parts of Christian history, the miracle itself contained a check upon the inconvenient consequences necessarily attached to all miracles, as miracles, narrowing the possible claims to any rights not proveable at the bar of universal reason and experience. Every man among the Sectaries, however ignorant, may justify himself in scattering stones and fire squibs by an alleged unction of the Spirit. The miracle becomes perpetual, still beginning, never ending. Now on the Church doctrine, the original miracle provides for the future recurrence to the ordinary and calculable laws of the human understanding and moral sense; instead of leaving every man a judge of his own gifts, and of his right to act publicly on that judgment. The initiative alone is supernatural; but all beginning is necessarily miraculous, that is, hath either no antecedent, or one [Greek: hetérou genous], which therefore is not its, but merely an, antecedent,--or an incausative alien co-incident in time; as if, for instance, Jack's shout were followed by a flash of lightning, which should strike and precipitate the ball on St. Paul's cathedral. This would be a miracle as long as no causative 'nexus' was conceivable between the antecedent, the noise of the shout, and the consequent, the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>discharge.</b>|$|E

40|$|Increased {{understanding}} of plasma-polymer interactions {{is required to}} further the technological use of such processes, and elucidates heterogeneous physico-chemical reactions which occur under bombardment by complex combinations of energetic species. This thesis presents a systematic investigation into the effect of exposing organic and inorganic polymeric surfaces to controlled non-isothermal plasmas. Concurrently, a novel process is presented by which metal oxide gas barrier coatings are synthesized on polymer substrates by non- isothermal plasma treatment. Organic polymers exhibiting a range of structures were modified using non-isothermal plasmas at atmospheric and low pressure. The extent of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>discharge</b> oxygenation, measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), correlated with the polymers' ozonolysis rate constants. Surface physical disruption, studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM), after <b>atmospheric</b> <b>discharge</b> treatment was more pronounced than after low pressure plasma treatment. During low pressure oxygen plasma treatment, polymers containing phenyl groups were oxygenated to an extent which varied with the strength of π-π* valence band excitation in XPS C(1 s) spectra of the untreated polymers, suggesting a dominance of reaction of plasma atomic oxygen at polymer radical sites excited by plasma vacuum ultraviolet radiation. The size of globules, observed by AFM, on the plasma modified surfaces correlated with the extent of surface chemical modification, inkeeping with a mechanism of chemically driven agglomeration of plasma oxidized low molecular weight polymer material. Oxygen plasma was more effective than water plasma in chemically modifying the surface of films of zirconium-normal-butoxide spin coated on polyester substrates, and the resulting optimized treatment produced {{a significant reduction in}} gas permeation of the substrate. XPS studies showed that oxygen plasma treatment of a polyphenylsilsesquioxane film on polyester film created a SiO(_ 2) layer less than 8 nm thin, which reduced O(_ 2) and Ar permeation of the coated film by 37. 5 % and 31. 6 % respectively...|$|E

30|$|The {{statistical}} superposed epoch {{analysis has}} shown that magnetic disturbances during the regional lightning activity comprises regular series of paired pulses. An initial pulse caused by an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>discharge</b> is followed by 1 – 2 pulses with a regular time delay. This echo-pulse is not caused by some secondary stroke, because no simultaneous burst {{can be seen in}} the SR band. Such paired pulses results in the formation of the multi-band SRS in dynamic spectra. The observed time delay fits well the SRS structure. The secondary pulses are supposed to be produced by the reflection of the initial lightning pulse from the IAR upper boundary. Thus, regional thunderstorms can give a noticeable input to the IAR power spectrum, and may be responsible, at least partly, for the SRS occurrence at middle latitudes.|$|E
