500|$|Critics {{and audiences}} have cited {{similarities}} with other films, literature or media, describing the perceived connections in ways ranging from simple [...] "borrowing" [...] to outright plagiarism. Ty Burr of the Boston Globe called it [...] "the same movie" [...] as Dances with Wolves. Like Dances with Wolves, Avatar {{has been characterized}} as being a [...] "white savior" [...] movie, in which a [...] "backwards" [...] native people is impotent without the leadership {{of a member of}} the invading white culture. Parallels to the concept and use of an avatar are in Poul Anderson's 1957 novelette [...] "Call Me Joe", in which a paralyzed man uses his mind from orbit to control an <b>artificial</b> <b>body</b> on Jupiter. Cinema audiences in Russia have noted that Avatar has elements in common with the 1960s Noon Universe novels by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, which are set in the 22nd century on a forested world called Pandora with a sentient indigenous species called the Nave. Various reviews have compared Avatar to the films , Pocahontas and The Last Samurai. NPR's Morning Edition has compared the film to a montage of tropes, with one commentator stating that Avatar was made by [...] "mixing a bunch of film scripts in a blender". Gary Westfahl wrote that [...] "the science fiction story that most closely resembles Avatar has to be Ursula K. Le Guin's novella [...] "The Word for World Is Forest" [...] (1972), another epic about a benevolent race of alien beings who happily inhabit dense forests while living in harmony with nature until they are attacked and slaughtered by invading human soldiers who believe that the only good gook is a dead gook." [...] The science fiction writer and editor Gardner Dozois said that along with the Anderson and Le Guin stories, the [...] "mash-up" [...] included Alan Dean Foster's 1975 novel, Midworld. Some sources saw similarities to the artwork of Roger Dean, which featured fantastic images of floating rock formations and dragons. In 2013, Dean sued Cameron and Fox, claiming that Pandora was inspired by 14 of his images. Dean sought damages of $50m. Dean's case was dismissed in 2014, and The Hollywood Reporter noted that Cameron has won multiple Avatar idea theft cases.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>body</b> part {{replacements}} {{are one of}} {{the many}} applications of bionics. Concerned with the intricate and thorough study of the properties and function of human body systems, bionics may be applied to solve some engineering problems. Careful study of the different functions and processes of the eyes, ears, and other organs paved the way for improved cameras, television, radio transmitters and receivers, and many other useful tools. These developments have indeed made our lives better, but the best contribution that bionics has made is in the field of biomedical engineering (the building of useful replacements for various parts of the human body).

Some jester, enlarging upon {{the increase of}} bald heads and purblind people, has deduced a wonderful future {{for the children of}} men. Man, he said, was nowadays a hairless creature by forty or fifty, and for hair we gave him a wig; shrivelled, and we padded him; toothless, and lo! false teeth set in gold. Did he lose a limb, and a fine, new, artificial one was at his disposal; get indigestion, and to hand was artificial digestive fluid or bile or pancreatine, as the case might be. Complexions, too, were replaceable, spectacles superseded an inefficient eye-lens, and imperceptible false diaphragms were thrust into the failing ear. So he went over our anatomies, until, at last, he had conjured up a weird thing of shreds and patches, a simulacrum, an <b>artificial</b> <b>body</b> of a man, with but a doubtful germ of living flesh lurking somewhere in his recesses.

Seeing the limitation of a single laboratory, we intend to cooperate with experts in different research areas to expand the applications of <b>artificial</b> oil <b>bodies.</b> We proposed to establish three biotechnological platforms in the following three years. (1) To engineer and produce recombinant oleosin or caleosin for the encapsulation of artificial oil bodies: For a better stability in long-term storage, techniques will be developed for solidification of <b>artificial</b> oil <b>bodies</b> in the forms of powder or tablet. (2) To engineer and produce recombinant caleosin for the encapsulation of <b>artificial</b> oil <b>bodies</b> containing functional antioxidant ingredient, curcumin or an anti-cancer drug, camptothecin.

(3) To engineer and produce recombinant oleosin or caleosin for the encapsulation of <b>artificial</b> oil <b>bodies</b> to generate antibodies against small molecules, such as catechin ECGC by presenting it on their surface.

40|$|With {{tropical}} floodplain wetlands ranking {{among the}} world's most threatened ecosystems, <b>artificial</b> water <b>bodies</b> are an often under-appreciated potential conservation resource for aquatic fauna in these heavily modified environments. This paper describes the fish communities in 27 <b>artificial</b> water <b>bodies</b> having three different management and design types (ditch recycle pits, generic recycle pits and constructed wetlands) on a heavily modified floodplain in northern Australia. In these <b>artificial</b> water <b>bodies,</b> constructed wetlands housed significantly higher mean native fish diversity, followed by generic recycle pits and then ditches, where communities were numerically dominated by invasive, non-native fishes. Environmental parameters {{such as water}} body depth and riparian zone condition were the descriptors that best explained fish community composition across water bodies. Comparison with collated fish survey data representing broader floodplain γ-diversity showed that > 70 % of regional fish diversity was housed in <b>artificial</b> water <b>bodies,</b> with constructed wetlands alone accounting for 68 % of freshwater species known from the floodplain. In addition, site (α) diversity of native species in constructed wetlands {{did not differ from}} site diversity in remnant, relatively intact natural water bodies, and was significantly greater than species diversity in heavily degraded, natural floodplain habitats. Study results provide strong evidence that <b>artificial</b> water <b>bodies</b> can make useful contributions to biodiversity conservation by providing artificial habitat in a floodplain environment dominated by agriculture...|$|R
