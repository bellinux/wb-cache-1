5|$|Acadia's border was not {{formally}} demarcated by the Treaty of Utrecht, which became <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> ongoing {{friction between the}} British and French, especially on the Isthmus of Chignecto, which both sides eventually fortified. The French interpreted the phrase ancient boundaries to imply only the peninsula of present-day Nova Scotia, thereby excluding the mainland between New England and the St. Lawrence, ÎLe St. Jean, and Cape Breton. This helped the Amerindians of Abenaquis, Malecites, and MicMacs to retain their sovereignty over their old hunting grounds.|$|E

5|$|Advanced COPD {{leads to}} high {{pressure}} on the lung arteries, which strains the right ventricle of the heart.

5|$|British mycologist Donald Dring, in his 1980 {{monograph}} on {{the family}} Clathraceae, wrote that C.ruber was not regarded highly in southern European folklore. He mentions a case of poisoning following its ingestion, reported by Barla in 1858, and notes that Ciro Pollini reported finding it growing on a human skull in a tomb in a deserted church. According to John Ramsbottom, Gascons consider the mushroom <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> cancer; they will usually bury specimens they find. In other parts of France it has been reputed to produce skin rashes or cause convulsions.|$|E
5|$|During the non-breeding season, storks in the Indian region {{disperse}} widely, {{mainly in}} the Gangetic Plains and sightings from the Deccan region are rare. Records of flocks from further south near Mahabalipuram have been questioned. In the 1800s, adjutant storks were extremely common within the city of Calcutta {{during the summer and}} rainy season. These aggregations along the Ghats of Calcutta however declined and vanished altogether by the early 1900s. Improved sanitation has been suggested as <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> their decline. Birds were recorded in Bangladesh in the 1850s, breeding somewhere in the Sundarbans, but have not been recorded subsequently.|$|E

This is <b>an</b> unusual <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> rhabdomyolysis even though hypokalemia is a common medical problem.

5|$|In March 2013, {{two studies}} were {{published}} showing that neonicotinoids affect bee long-term and short-term memory, suggesting <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> action resulting in failure {{to return to}} the hive. In another study done in 2013, scientists reported that experiments suggested that exposure to the neonicotinoid pesticides clothianidin and imidicloprid results in increased levels of a particular protein in bees that inhibits a key molecule involved in the immune response, making the insects more susceptible to attack by harmful viruses.|$|E
5|$|Malaria is {{not just}} a disease {{commonly}} associated with poverty: some evidence suggests that it is also <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> poverty and a major hindrance to economic development. Although tropical regions are most affected, malaria's furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread.

5|$|Other {{scholars}} {{have identified the}} text's tone as satirical and mildly obscene, locating it among a movement of pamphlets influenced by a counter-trend promoting greater sympathy for prostitution. Linda Dowling interprets the pamphlet less a broadside against sodomites, and more as evidence of a strand in rhetoric that valorized Britain's martial past and saw {{lack of respect for}} it as a precondition for vice. Ian Bell considers the causality of this relationship between moral collapse and vice, characterizing the book as part of strand that saw vice as a product, not <b>a</b> <b>cause,</b> <b>of</b> a fundamental collapse in morality in Augustan London.|$|E

Other fungi can attack eyes, nails, hair, and especially skin, the so-called dermatophytic and keratinophilic fungi, and cause local infections such as ringworm and athlete's foot.
