5|$|American {{forces in}} Iraq were {{withdrawn}} {{in large numbers}} in 2009 and 2010, {{and the war in}} the region was declared formally over in December 2011.

In 2014, Obama announced <b>a</b> <b>restoration</b> of full diplomatic relations with Cuba {{for the first time since}} 1961.

5|$|In {{approximately}} 1200 a north aisle was added, {{with its}} width being {{determined by the}} projection of the north transept chapel, with the west and east walls taken down at the time. The different thickness of the walls in the present church suggests that the wall {{for the length of}} the first three bays of the arcade was taken down and rebuilt in the 13th century. The church underwent <b>a</b> <b>restoration</b> in 1839, with £370 being spent, and in 1875 at a cost of £2,377.|$|E
5|$|Soon Vladimir Bukovsky {{was again}} out of favour with the Russian authorities. He {{supported}} Yeltsin against the Supreme Soviet in the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis in October that year but criticised the new Constitution of Russia approved two months later, as being {{designed to ensure}} a continuation of Yeltsin's power. According to Bukovsky, Yeltsin became a hostage of the security agencies from 1994 onwards, and <b>a</b> <b>restoration</b> of KGB rule was inevitable.|$|E
5|$|The father {{panel is}} {{signed and dated}} on both sides, {{in what may be}} the oldest extant {{instance}} of Dürer's signature monogram of a large open A and small d.

Barbara's panel underwent <b>a</b> <b>restoration</b> in 1974, when the surface was cleaned and partially revarnished, with repairs to damage on the reverse sustained from woodboring.|$|E
