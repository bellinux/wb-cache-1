25|$|Despite {{a general}} {{consensus}} <b>about</b> <b>values</b> and ideologies underlying the monumental complex of Mont'e Prama, political implications and artistic influences are still hotly debated. As for political significance, some scholars {{tend to see}} in the small number of warriors, with respect to archers, a sign of military and political decay of the Nuragic society, caused by the establishment of Phoenician centers in Sardinia. This would be mirrored by the import and adoption of Levantine ideological models and by assignment of the statues to the orientalizing period spreading throughout the Mediterranean area during the 8th century BC.|$|E

500|$|South Park {{was part}} of a {{reaction}} to the culture wars of the 1980s and 1990s in the United States, in which issues such as Murphy Brown's motherhood, Tinky Winky's sexuality, and the Simpsons' family values were extensively debated. The culture wars, and political correctness in particular, were driven by the belief that relativism was becoming more relevant to daily life and thus what were perceived as [...] "traditional" [...] and reliable values were losing their place in American society. South Park, one scholar explains, [...] "made a name for itself as rude, crude, vulgar, offensive, and potentially dangerous" [...] within this debate <b>about</b> <b>values.</b> Its critics argued that Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny were poor role models for children while its supporters celebrated the show's defense of free speech.|$|E
500|$|The {{continued}} {{influx of}} foreign players at Arsenal has, however, attracted criticism. In a league match against Crystal Palace on 14 February 2005, Arsenal fielded a 16-man squad that featured no British players {{for the first}} time in the club's history. This prompted Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) chief executive Gordon Taylor to express it would begin [...] "a worrying pattern for English football". A year later, manager Alan Pardew commented that Arsenal's Champions League success was [...] "not necessarily a triumph for British football". Wenger saw the issue of nationality as irrelevant and said, [...] "When you represent a club, it's <b>about</b> <b>values</b> and qualities, not about passports". Other pundits including Trevor Brooking, the director of football development at the FA, have defended Wenger. Brooking has stated that a lack of English players in [...] "one of England's most successful clubs" [...] was more of a reflection on England's limited talent pool rather than on Wenger, an opinion shared by youth team coach and ex-Liverpool player Craig Johnston.|$|E

They outline how to understand “willingness-to-pay” (WTP), they challenge the “one-size fits all” approach and give an explanation why many segmentation model fail, they question traditional price metrics and their ability to capture value, they address how to define the right pricing strategy and they elaborate <b>about</b> <b>value</b> communication.

40|$|The affect-as-information {{framework}} {{posits that}} affect is embodied information <b>about</b> <b>value</b> and importance. The valence dimension of affect provides evaluative information about stimulus objects, which {{plays a role}} in judgment and decision-making. Affect can also provide evaluative information about one’s own cognitions and response inclinations, information that guides thinking and reasoning. In particular, positive affect often promotes, and negative affect inhibits, accessible responses or dominant modes of thinking. Affect thus moderates many of the textbook phenomena in cognitive psychology. In the current review, we suggest additionally that the arousal dimension of affect amplifies reactions, leading to intensified evaluations, increased reliance on particular styles of learning, and enhanced long-term memory for events. We conclude that whereas valenced affective cues serve as information <b>about</b> <b>value,</b> the arousal dimension provides information about urgency or importance. All living creatures have in common the necessity of continually evaluatin...|$|R
