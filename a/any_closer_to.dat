5|$|Buffalo {{took over}} {{at their own}} 19-yard line and {{promptly}} earned their 1stfirstdown of the game on a 10-yardpass from quarterback Drew Willy to wide receiver Naaman Roosevelt. The Bulls' drive stalled from there, forcing them to punt. The punt struck the ground and hit UConn's Jonathan Jean-Louis, who was attempting to block for the punt return; Buffalo recovered the loose ball, giving them back possession at the Connecticut 23-yard line. The Bulls were unable to move the ball <b>any</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the end zone, and settled for a 38-yard field goal by kicker A. J. Principe, giving them a 3–0 lead with 4:26 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|Rousseau {{had also}} been badly wounded in the exchange, and command of Junon passed to Lieutenant Jean-Léon Emeric, who {{attempted}} {{to pull away from}} his battered adversary. As he did so the small brig Driver was well placed to intervene, but her captain, Charles Claridge, failed to engage the larger frigate, even though Latona was now rapidly approaching from the west and together they could have outnumbered and outmanoeuvred Junon. Superieure was also close by, and her captain, William Ferrie, did approach the larger French ship, his fire causing enough damage to Junons sails to prevent her escape. Taking Horatio in tow at 14:24, the brig kept Scott's frigate in the chase until sufficient repairs were complete. By 14:40 Horatio was again sailing independently and Driver finally came close enough to open fire, although at extreme range: Claridge refused to sail <b>any</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Junon, despite urgent signals from Horatio and Superieure. At 15:04, Superieure was again close enough to the French ship to open fire and at 15:25 Latona arrived, her presence finally convincing Claridge to enter the action. Surrounded by enemy ships and his sails in tatters, Emeric made one last effort to escape to the north, the strain of this manoeuvre causing his main and mizen masts to collapse. With both flight and resistance impossible, Junon surrendered at 15:40.|$|E

Acting on the threat, Walker relieved the regiment from the 24th Infantry Division on August 14 and the next day ordered it northward to Kyongsan as a reserve force. Arriving at Kyongsan on August 16, Colonel John H.

Sighting several ships, neither Murphy nor his executive officer, Edward Spruance (son of Admiral Spruance), could identify them. Uncertain of whether they were friendly or not and unwilling to approach <b>any</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> verify their heading or type, Murphy decided to send a vague report of [...] "four large ships" [...] to Admiral Robert English, Commander, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet (COMSUBPAC).

Despite numerous labs performing mammalian cloning, they cited that Hwang's team and Snuppy were [...] "extraordinary". The experiment was criticised by Robert Klitzman, director of Columbia University's Masters in Bioethics program, who cited that the process raised the question of if humans are [...] "just a mass of cells and biological processes?" [...] Hwang himself criticised the process, stating that it did not bring science <b>any</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> human cloning and the complexities, coupled with the low success rate (one in 123), did not make it ethical to clone family pets. Ian Wilmut, the scientist behind the successful cloning of Dolly the sheep, said that the successful cloning of Snuppy proved that any mammal could be cloned in the correct environments and that a global ban on human cloning needed to be quickly implemented because of this.

[...] The Roman chief of police asked Edgardo to return to his family to appease public opinion, but he refused. He subsequently met the Italian commander, General Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora, who told him that as he was 19 years old he could do as he wished. Edgardo was smuggled out of Rome by train along with a priest on 22 October 1870, late at night and in lay clothes. He made his way north and escaped to Austria.|$|E
