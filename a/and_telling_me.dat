[...] "He {{was one of}} the best I’d ever seen," [...] Willie Davis, a defensive end who played for the Browns shortly after Lavelli retired, said. [...] "He set the mold with his running patterns and catching the ball." [...] After Lavelli died, Graham praised his abilities and remembered his eagerness to get his hands on the ball. [...] "He was always coming into the huddle <b>and</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> he was open and that I should throw to him," [...] Graham said. [...] "He wasn't saying that to be a big shot. He just loved to play. If he was open by a few inches, he'd be yelling, 'Otto, Otto.' Many a time when I was stuck and heard that voice I would throw it in his direction and darned if he didn't come down with it. He had fantastic hands." ...|$|E

Producers {{of the show}} {{were not allowed to}} photograph the interior of the actual buildings as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a point of reference due to its high security. Although the location was not featured in the comics of the same name, Hurd felt {{that it was important to}} add because of its close proximity to the survivor's camp. As opposed to the previous episode, where filming mostly took place outside of the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, production for [...] "TS-19" [...] occurred inside of the building. Darabont conceived the idea of exploring into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

[...] "That's one of the reasons I was so on board with the idea." ...|$|E
