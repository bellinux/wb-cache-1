Also, the ZACM variables are in good agreement with the observations. The model is used to investigate its reponse to the greenhouse effect regarding the doubling of CO 2 and the changing of cloud amount and height. An enhancement of the greenhouse effect is noted in the case 2 x CO 2 and when the cloud layer is higher. However, an increase of the cloud amount in all the latitude belts provokes an increase of the surface temperature near poles and a decrease in all the other regions...|$|R
