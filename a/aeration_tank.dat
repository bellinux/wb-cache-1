2500|$|The [...] "Modified Ludzak-Ettinger Process" [...] (MLE) [...] is an {{improvement}} {{on the original}} concept, for it recycles mixed liquor from the discharge end of the <b>aeration</b> <b>tank</b> {{to the head of}} the anoxic tank to provide a consistent source of soluble nitrate for the facultative bacteria. [...] In this instance, raw wastewater continues to provide the electron source, and sub-surface mixing maintains the bacteria in contact with both electron source and soluble nitrate in the absence of dissolved oxygen.|$|E
2500|$|Over time, {{different}} treatment configurations {{have evolved}} as denitrification {{has become more}} sophisticated. [...] An initial scheme, the Ludzack-Ettinger Process, placed an anoxic treatment zone before the <b>aeration</b> <b>tank</b> and clarifier, using the return activated sludge (RAS) from the clarifier as a nitrate source. [...] Influent wastewater (either raw or as effluent from primary clarification) serves as the electron source for the facultative bacteria to metabolize carbon, using the inorganic nitrate {{as a source of}} oxygen instead of dissolved molecular oxygen. This denitrification scheme was naturally limited to the amount of soluble nitrate present in the RAS. [...] Nitrate reduction was limited because RAS rate is limited by the performance of the clarifier.|$|E

40|$|Describes an {{investigation}} into the mechanisms responsible for sludge carry-over during decant from intermittent <b>aeration</b> <b>tanks.</b> Several mechanisms were identified which may cause sludge carry-over. An "early failure" mode may occur during the transient phase at the start of decant. This can be avoided by gradually increasing the rate of decant to a final steady value. The time required for flow establishment is in the order of five minutes in tanks of current size. Following the transient phase, failure can occur when interfacial shear stresses between the supernatant and settled sludge exceed some critical value. This {{is considered to be a}} "scour failure" analagous to the onset of erosion of a cohesive sediment. Experiments conducted in a variety of different types of extended <b>aeration</b> <b>tanks</b> indicated that the critical parameters governing failure are the upstream velocity of the supernatant, the settlement time, and the Stirred Sludge Volume Index, SSVI. Appreciation of the failure mechanisms has indicated certain design improvements which could be made to existing <b>aeration</b> <b>tanks,</b> in particular to the rate of changee of weir loading and the design of scum barriers.

40|$|An {{industry}} {{that participated in}} an energy efficiency program initially installed a fine bubble aeration system {{in one of its}} smaller <b>aeration</b> <b>tanks.</b> The industry thought this was the best approach to try the fine bubble change in equipment in a small tank and if it proved to be energy efficient they may consider it in their other tanks [...] The modification proved to be very beneficial to the industry because the summer after it was installed they increased the organic load to be treated by approximately 30 percent. The installed fine bubble system treated more than 50 % of the facility?s influent. This performance exceeded forecasted expectations and provided real performance data to support additional modifications. The industry has moved forward to convert two additional small tanks to fine bubble aeration. The conversion will provide the facility with the option to operate only its three small <b>aeration</b> <b>tanks</b> to treat all of its wastewater. The paper will provide the details of the initial energy efficient recommendation to convert all of the <b>aeration</b> <b>tanks.</b> Further it will present the development of how the plan was modified to address staging the improvements. The industry is presently consuming the same amount of energy as it was originally, however, it is treating 30 % more organic load with the industry continuing to increase its production. Therefore for this location a modification to equipment is allowing them to control their energy consumption and eliminate the need to construct additional treatment tanks. ...|$|R

40|$|Describes an {{investigation}} into the mechanisms responsible for sludge carry-over during decant from intermittent <b>aeration</b> <b>tanks.</b> Three possible modes of failure were identified: 1. early carry-over which may occur during the transient phase at the start of decant; 2. a failure selectively to withdraw from the supernatant alone; 3. scour failure of the sludge blanket when the interfacial shear stress exceeds some critical value. This mode of failure is analagous to the onset of erosion in cohesive sediments. A variety of experiments were conducted to develop design criteria to ensure against sludge carry-over. The experiments indicated that modes one and three were the most significant, and that the critical parameter was the velocity of the supernatant as it approached the weir. It is therefore concluded that a maximum upstream velocity is the most appropriate design criterion for a decant mechanism. Appreciation of the failure mechanisms has indicated certain design improvements which might be made to existing <b>aeration</b> <b>tanks,</b> in particular to the rate of change of weir loading, and the design of scum barriers...|$|R
