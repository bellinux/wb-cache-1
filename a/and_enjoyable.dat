5|$|Critical {{reception}} for {{the album was}} generally favorable, with several reviewers pointing {{out the fact that}} it highly resembled the band's debut album. Critics also said the album was less groundbreaking than their debut but had humorous <b>and</b> <b>enjoyable</b> pieces. The album peaked at 148 on the Billboard 200 despite its critical acclaim as well as the band members expecting more commercial success.|$|E
5|$|Williams shipped around 1,000units of Joust 2, {{significantly}} fewer than its predecessor. Brett Alan Weiss of Allgame and Mike Bevan of Retro Gamer attributed the poor numbers to an industry slump in the mid-1980s. Joust 2 arcade cabinets have since become fairly rare among collectors. Weiss negatively compared {{the game to}} its predecessor, calling Joust more popular <b>and</b> <b>enjoyable.</b> However, he commented that Joust 2s graphics are more detailed and robust.|$|E
5|$|On release, {{the four}} reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly applauded Kirby's Block Ball for modifying the Breakout formula {{to create a}} new <b>and</b> <b>enjoyable</b> game. They {{especially}} praised the unique power-ups, though Crispin Boyer and Sushi X also felt the game was too short and easy. Nintendo Power said they enjoyed Block Ball and its number of stages, but wondered how its eight megabits of memory were being used. The magazine found the parts where Kirby eats the unbreakable blocks to be innovative. All six of the magazine's reviewers recommended the game.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, Mary Dennett focused {{her efforts}} on the peace movement, but she {{returned}} to the birth control movement in 1918. She continued to lead the NBCL, and collaborated with Sanger's NYWPC. In 1919, Dennett published a widely distributed educational pamphlet, The Sex Side of Life, which treated sex as a natural <b>and</b> <b>enjoyable</b> act. However, in the same year, frustrated with the NBCL's chronic lack of funding, Dennett broke away and formed the Voluntary Parenthood League (VPL). Both Dennett and Sanger proposed legislative changes that would legalize birth control, but they took different approaches: Sanger endorsed contraception but only under a physician's supervision; Dennett pushed for unrestricted access to contraception.Engelman, pp. 113–115. Sanger, a proponent of diaphragms, was concerned that unrestricted access would result in ill-fitting diaphragms and would lead to medical quackery.McCann (1994), pp. 71–72 gives examples that show Sanger's fears were justified. Dennett was concerned that requiring women to get prescriptions from physicians would prevent poor women from receiving contraception, and she was concerned about a shortage of physicians trained in birth control. Both legislative initiatives failed, partly because some legislators felt that fear of pregnancy {{was the only thing that}} kept women chaste. In the early 1920s, Sanger's leadership position in the movement solidified because she gave frequent public lectures, and because she took steps to exclude Dennett from meetings and events.|$|E

25|$|God realm (Deva): {{the gods}} lead long <b>and</b> <b>enjoyable</b> lives full of {{pleasure}} and abundance, but they spend their lives pursuing meaningless distractions and never think to practice the dharma.

25|$|Jean Webster (pseudonym for Alice Jane Chandler Webster, July 24, 1876 – June 11, 1916) was an American {{writer and}} author of many books {{including}} Daddy-Long-Legs and Dear Enemy. Her best-known books feature lively and likeable young female protagonists who come of age intellectually, morally, and socially, but with enough humor, snappy dialogue, and gently biting social commentary to make her books palatable <b>and</b> <b>enjoyable</b> to contemporary readers.|$|E
50|$|The Tenctonese have fairly mature {{attitudes towards}} sex: it happens <b>and</b> is <b>enjoyable,</b> <b>and</b> {{nothing to be}} ashamed about, but at the same time, they feel it is not {{something}} to be taken lightly. They find oversexualized human things such as pornography to be silly or juvenile. They also have no particular taboo against same-sex relationships.|$|R

25|$|The plays {{swept the}} {{audience}} along a unique <b>and</b> <b>enjoyable</b> journey, an Odyssey of insights which recounted {{the story of}} one member of an invisible minority who struggled with her sexuality and, over time, grew increasingly confident and self-aware, with more than a little help from her friends. Heng hoped that the LGBT community would relate to the plays which included 'insider' jokes and references that could only be fully appreciated by the gay community, with scripts that were not dumbed down to accommodate a straight audience. Owing to its lesbian theme, the producers experienced great difficulty in securing a corporate sponsor.|$|E
25|$|NanoPutians are {{a series}} of organic {{molecules}} whose structural formulae resemble human forms. James Tour et al. (Rice University) designed and synthesized these compounds in 2003 {{as a part of a}} sequence on chemical education for young students. The compounds consist of two benzene rings connected via a few carbon atoms as the body, four acetylene units each carrying an alkyl group at their ends which represents the hands and legs, and a 1,3-dioxolane ring as the head. Tour and his team at Rice University used the NanoPutians in their NanoKids educational outreach program. The goal of this program was to educate children in the sciences in an effective <b>and</b> <b>enjoyable</b> manner. They have made several videos featuring the NanoPutians as anthropomorphic animated characters.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{reception}} for MUSHA was mixed. Critics found themselves {{overwhelmed by the}} sheer amount of shoot 'em ups on the Sega Genesis and felt the title was unremarkable. Journalists generally agreed the game had great graphics <b>and</b> <b>enjoyable</b> gameplay, but felt it was unoriginal and not very challenging. In retrospect, MUSHA has garnered much higher praise, being cited for its challenging gameplay, strong soundtrack, and graphics considered ahead of its time. It remains among the most highly regarded shoot 'em ups on the Genesis and is considered among {{the best of the}} 16-bit era. Original MUSHA cartridges have become rare and command high prices in the collector market, however, the game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan in 2008, and the west in 2009.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, {{members of}} the free {{software}} community maintain the vision that all software {{is a part of}} freedom of speech and that proprietary software is unethical and unjust. The free software movement openly champions this belief through talks that denounce proprietary software. As a whole the community refuses to support proprietary software. Further there are external motivations for these developers. One motivation is that, when a programmer fixes a bug or makes a program it benefits others in an open source environment. Another motivation is that a programmer can work on multiple projects that they find interesting <b>and</b> <b>enjoyable.</b> Programming in the open source world can also lead to commercial job offers or entrance into the venture capital community. These are just a few reasons why open source programmers continue to create and advance software.|$|E
