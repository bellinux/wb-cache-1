25|$|After George Galloway's {{expulsion}} from the Labour Party in October 2003 following his controversial statements <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> he {{became involved in}} Respect - The Unity Coalition (now the Respect Party) in an alliance with the Socialist Workers Party and leading figures from the Muslim Association of Britain. Galloway was elected as a Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow at the 2005 general election, where he defeated sitting Labour MP; Oona King. The association with the SWP ended in 2007. Galloway lost the seat at the 2010 general election, but returned to the House of Commons after winning the Bradford West by-election, 2012. Respect though has suffered from the resignation of leading members over the years, and Galloway lost his seat to Naz Shah of the Labour Party at the 2015 general election.|$|E
500|$|The {{title is}} a pun on Steven Spielberg's hit war film Saving Private Ryan. Several {{scenes from the}} Army {{training}} contained real-life references; when the recruits are marching, they begin to sing and dance; this is a reference to West Side Story. Additionally, the song playing during the recruitment video bears a close resemblance to the Def Leppard song [...] "Pour Some Sugar On Me". When Peter visits a psychiatrist, the psychiatrist is Dr. Katz. The training {{is similar to that}} in the film Full Metal Jacket, also spoofing the scene when the Sergeant found contraband food. The Sergeant punishes Brian by informing him that he will have to listen to singles from Chris Gaines' album: this entire scene was based on a sketch from Saturday Night Live approximately 10 years ago. Peter references actor Gregory Peck and his [...] "kids" [...] with a cutaway gag featuring four Pecks in a car. Brian shown performing numerous different tasks to complete his army training is a reference to An Officer and a Gentleman, with the music playing in the background from Stripes. The lyrics Lois reads from the Wu-Tang Clan album is from the song [...] "Bring Da Ruckus", the first track from their album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). The scene where Marilyn Manson tells Chris about nutrition is a reference to an episode of Clone High, where Manson leads a musical scene {{about the importance of the}} food pyramid. The sign outside of the building where the Grammys are being held says [...] "Welcome to the Grammys (Not You, Fred Durst)", a reference to the lead singer of Limp Bizkit. Stewie misunderstands the location of their deployment to be [...] "Fraggle Ir-Rock", rather than Iraq, referring to the TV show Fraggle Rock. The scene where Zinedine Zidane headbutts an old lady while delivering her a birthday cake is based on the incident that happened in the 2006 FIFA World Cup final, when Zidane headbutted Marco Materazzi. [...] When Brian is frustrated with the recruits recommending Chris to join the Army, Stewie says that 10% of his high school class is off to fight another battle. After hearing Stewie, Brian says that he was plagiarizing from The Onion, since Brian read <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> in The Onion. During the obstacle course, Brian rides a unicycle, solves a Rubik's Cube, plays Perfection, finds Waldo, offers a couple eating a salad at a dinner table some fresh pepper, and consoles a woman who was just dumped by her boyfriend.|$|E

I'm tired of getting pushed around, and our people getting pushed around by the situation in the Middle East." [...] He also demanded that the U.S. military get out of Iraq. He asked if he could be patched through to CNN. The dispatcher told Haq that was not possible, and informed him that talking with the media would not alter U.S. policy. Haq calmed down and told the dispatcher that he would surrender. He then put his guns down and walked silently out of the building with his hands on his head. He surrendered at 4:15p.m. and was taken into custody by police. At 10:38p.m., he was booked into King County Jail on one count of investigation of homicide and five counts of investigation of attempted murder.|$|E
