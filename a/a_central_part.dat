5|$|<b>A</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> of Macdonald's case {{concerned}} the {{redistribution of wealth}} from richer provinces to poorer ones. His argument {{was based on the}} premise that richer provinces benefited from national economic policies such as high tariffs while poorer provinces were penalized by them. Macdonald suggested that compensatory subsidies to poorer, less-populated provinces be based on need, not population, so that they could pay for government services available in other parts of the country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{entertainments}} formed <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> of {{the games}} and normally {{took place in the}} morning. Dio says that {{over the course of the}} inaugural games upward of nine thousand tamed and wild animals were slain sometimes by women of no particular prominence. This conflicts with the work of Eutropius who wrote, in the later part of the fourth century, that 5,000 animals were slain during the games.|$|E

While the film was in pre-production, Favreau shadowed Choi in his restaurants and worked as part of Choi's kitchen crew after training at a culinary school. Choi oversaw all of the menus prepared for the film and created the Cuban sandwiches that formed <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> of the storyline.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> of the {{non-discrimination}} {{policy is}} the Mining Code of 7 August 1925. It is uncertain if the code is internationally binding, or {{if it can be}} amended unilaterally by Norway. Specifically, the commissioner issues licenses to search for minerals and state-owned and other owner's land and to register claims. To maintain a claim, the owner must work 1,500 man-hours per five years and pay an annual fee of 6,000 Norwegian krone. However, the Ministry of Trade and Industry may grant exceptions from the work obligation under specific conditions.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> of the show's premise {{was that}} the main {{character}} would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained {{that he did not}} want the character to be that young.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's {{prescription}} for strong public investment had ties to {{his interest in}} uncertainty. Keynes had given a unique perspective on statistical inference in A Treatise on Probability, written in 1921, years before his major economic works. Keynes thought strong public investment and fiscal policy would counter the negative impacts the uncertainty of economic fluctuations can have on the economy. While Keynes's successors {{paid little attention to}} the probabilistic parts of his work, uncertainty may have played <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> in the investment and liquidity-preference aspects of General Theory.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{military}} texts written before {{the unification of}} China and Shi Huangdi's subsequent book burning {{in the second century}} BC, six major works have survived. During the much later Song dynasty, these six works were combined with a Tang text into a collection called the Seven Military Classics. As <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> of that compilation, The Art of War formed the foundations of orthodox military theory in early modern China. Illustrating this point, the book was required reading to pass the tests for imperial appointment to military positions.|$|E

Sometimes Fiona will panic when in danger, {{in which case}} she begins to run on her own and the player loses some control. Hewie is <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> to the gameplay, and accompanies Fiona throughout the game. He can be given orders to explore the environment, attack enemies, and otherwise aid in Fiona's survival. Capcom added the dog mechanic during development thinking retailers and players alike would not enjoy a survival horror title with a lone female protagonist.|$|E
5|$|Various Germanic tribes have {{inhabited}} the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before 100AD. During the Migration Period, the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became {{the centre of}} the Protestant Reformation. After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the German Confederation was formed in 1815. The German revolutions of 1848–49 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament establishing major democratic rights.|$|E
5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{completed}} their new combined story {{in about a}} week. The writers spent hours each day at Stillwell's apartment working over every detail; they felt pressured {{to write a story}} Piller would find acceptable, as they wanted {{to have the opportunity to}} write the teleplay. The story treatment was turned in on October 10. Piller immediately decided to purchase the story and distributed the treatment to the writing staff while he discussed changes. Piller felt that Data's romantic feelings for TashaYar were over the top, and that an alien probe which served as <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> of the story was a cheat in terms of resolving Picard's dilemma. The writer wanted Ganino and Stillwell to enhance Guinan's role and to find another character arc for TashaYar. A revised treatment was submitted on October 29, incorporating Piller's changes. The writers were not involved in development of the teleplay. They were each paid the Writers Guild minimum of $2400.|$|E

5|$|In {{line with}} its {{traditional}} Western orientation, relations with Europe {{have always been}} <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> of Turkish foreign policy. Turkey {{became one of the}} first members of the Council of Europe in 1949, applied for associate membership of the EEC (predecessor of the European Union) in 1959 and became an associate member in 1963. After decades of political negotiations, Turkey applied for full membership of the EEC in 1987, became an associate member of the Western European Union in 1992, joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 and has been in formal accession negotiations with the EU since 2005. Today, EU membership is considered as a state policy and a strategic target by Turkey. Turkey's support for Northern Cyprus in the Cyprus dispute complicates Turkey's relations with the EU and remains a major stumbling block to the country's EU accession bid.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{education}} system played <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> in the country's recovery and {{rapid economic growth}} in the decades following the end of World War II. After World War II, the Fundamental Law of Education and the School Education Law were enacted. The latter law defined the school system that would be in effect for many decades: six years of elementary school, three years of junior high school, three years of high school, and two or four years of university. Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program, in hopes to mitigate bullying and truancy; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide in the coming years. In Japan, having a strong educational background greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money to support oneself. Highly educated individuals are less affected by unemployment trends as higher levels of educational attainment make an individual more attractive in the workforce. The lifetime earnings also increase with each level of education attained. Furthermore, skills needed in the modern 21st century labor market are becoming more knowledge-based and strong aptitude in science and mathematics are more strong predictors of employment prospects in Japan's highly technological economy.|$|E

After searching the Wilson house, the detectives find love letters written by Hal Wilson to Brierre. Pembleton questions Felix and Hal, who agree to talk only if their statements are not admissible in court. Pembleton confronts the Wilsons with the love letters, which Hal said he never had the courage to give to Brierre. Felix said he would not have had sex with Brierre if he had known, which Hal said he does not believe. Felix demands the truth from Hal, who admits to killing Brierre in a jealous rage upon learning of her affair with his father.|$|E

5|$|The Crew's {{performance}} improved remarkably in the 2008 season. Schmid adjusted their offensive {{tactics to}} be based on ball possession and flank speed. He made Schelotto <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> of the plan in a roaming playmaker position, a role in which Schelotto excelled and the Argentinian was named the league's MVP. With a 1–0 victory over the Houston Dynamo at Crew Stadium on April 26, Schmid became the second MLS coach to win 100 regular-season games. The Crew {{went on to win the}} Supporters' Shield with the best record in the league. In the playoffs, Columbus defeated the New York Red Bulls 3–1 at Schmid's former home stadium, Los Angeles's Home Depot Center, to win the MLS Cup. Schmid received the Coach of the Year Award for the second time. Part of the success was attributed to Schmid's restructuring of the squad in 2006 and 2007.|$|E
5|$|The RPF {{selected}} Paul Kagame as its presidential candidate, {{to run for}} {{his first}} full term following his three-year transitional presidency. His main challenger was Faustin Twagiramungu, who had been prime minister from 1994 to 1995, when he resigned and moved to Brussels after a disagreement with Kagame. Twagiramungu had intended to run as the candidate for the MDR, but instead sought the presidency as an independent following the party's banishment. Twagiramungu returned to the country in June 2003 and began campaigning in August. Two other candidates also ran: Alvera Mukabaramba, a medical doctor and former MDR member running for the newly formed Party for Progress and Concord (PPC), and Jean Nepomuscene Nayinzira, an independent and former member of parliament who cited belief in God as <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> of his campaign. Mukabaramba pulled out one day before the election, accusing Twagiramungu of ethnic propaganda and advising her supporters to vote for Kagame. The election went ahead on 25 August with Kagame, Twagiramungu and Nayinzira as candidates.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians used donkeys and oxen as beasts of burden, {{and they}} were {{responsible}} for plowing the fields and trampling seed into the soil. The slaughter of a fattened ox was also <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> of an offering ritual. Horses were introduced by the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period. Camels, although known from the New Kingdom, were not used as beasts of burden until the Late Period. There is also {{evidence to suggest that}} elephants were briefly utilized in the Late Period but largely abandoned due to lack of grazing land. Dogs, cats, and monkeys were common family pets, while more exotic pets imported from the heart of Africa, such as Sub-Saharan African lions, were reserved for royalty. Herodotus observed that the Egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses. During the Predynastic and Late periods, the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular, such as the cat goddess Bastet and the ibis god Thoth, and these animals were bred in large numbers on farms for the purpose of ritual sacrifice.|$|E
