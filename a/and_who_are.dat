5|$|About 70% {{of student}} tuition {{is funded by}} LDS Church tithing funds, making tuition less {{expensive}} for church members than at similar private universities. Students not {{members of the church}} pay double the LDS tuition rate. For the 2014-2015 school year, Marriott School tuition for full-time LDS undergraduates is $2,500 per semester; for Marriott School graduate students, it is $5,810 per semester. All Marriott School students may apply for several school-specific and university-wide financial aid opportunities. Some are program-specific, others are need-based. The Hawes Scholars program is the highest scholarship distinction given to MBA students at the school. The program awards $10,000 to second-year students who are nominated by students or faculty, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> then selected based on academic performance, leadership maturity, and a commitment to high ethical standards.|$|E

In general, eligibility for a grant of arms {{is based on an}} individual's contributions to the community, although the exact criteria for grants or registrations have not been published. A number of grants have been made to people who have already been recognized with state honours for their notable achievements, such as through admission to the Order of Canada, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> accordingly entitled to a grant of arms.

40|$|The one <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> to come: The God of {{commitment}} {{according to the}} book of Revelation The theocentricity of Revelation makes an imperative of the placement of the committed One <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> to come in the centre of history of mankind. God's character, as depicted in Revelation, is developed through interaction with all creation. The response of nondivine characters to their creator shapes the hearer's/readers' perception of God, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> both revealed <b>and</b> shrouded in mystery through the apocalyptic visions. Through direct, indirect and interdividual characterisation, the focus falls on the expression "who is to come" to emphasise God's commitment, through the sacrifice of the Lamb...|$|R

5|$|In 2008, Wong created Wandering Home, an {{installation}} {{consisting of a}} mobile home conceptualised on city living and the homeless, which was shown at the Venice Biennale of Architecture. The small tin hut {{on the back of}} a tricycle is a comment on Hong Kong society, and the plight of people who sleep on the streets <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> forced to move on periodically by government officials. Costing HK$5,000 to make, the house is not exactly a practical solution to the homeless, but the concept was tried out on street sleepers in Sham Shui Po. In 2008, Wong created Tin Man No.11, an essay in space in the form of a metallic robot that transforms into a bed. He extended the concept by creating Famiglia Grande, a series of transformable cases. In 2009, Wong attended the Subvision Festival in Hamburg as a skyscraper.|$|E

Jetsam is a partially underwater society, as its natives possess an amphibious physiology, and are capable of surviving in and out of water. Upsher and Doff experience more than one confrontation with Freelancers hired {{to put an end to}} their investigation. The Brand poisons them with embargon, a substance that will kill them if they report their findings about the family to anyone else, though they attempt to find a way around this in order to continue their investigation. After they learn The Brand is dead, they attempt to resume their investigation, but are confronted by The Will, who drafts them into his service.|$|E
