5|$|The no {{decompression}} limit (NDL) or no stop time, is {{the interval}} that a diver may theoretically spend <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> depth {{without having to}} perform decompression stops.

5|$|Altimeter {{setting is}} a term and {{quantity}} used in aviation. The regional or local air pressure at mean sea level is called the altimeter setting, and the pressure which will calibrate the altimeter to show the height above ground <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> QNH airfield.|$|E

5|$|A {{station model}} is a {{symbolic}} illustration showing the weather occurring <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to plot a number of weather elements in a small space on weather maps. Maps filled with dense station-model plots {{can be difficult to}} read, but they allow meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns. A computer draws a station model for each observation location. The station model is primarily used on surface-weather maps, but {{can also be used to}} show the weather aloft. A completed station-model map allows users to analyze patterns in air pressure, temperature, wind, cloud cover, and precipitation.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> {{temperature}} a {{lipid bilayer}} can exist {{in either a}} liquid or a gel (solid) phase. All lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition (melt) from the gel to liquid phase. In both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer, but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second. This random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander {{across the surface of}} the membrane. Unlike liquid phase bilayers, the lipids in a gel phase bilayer have less mobility.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} by land locations coding in METAR are conveyed worldwide via phone lines or wireless technology.

5|$|Deep dives {{should be}} made only after a gradual {{training}} to test the individual diver's sensitivity to increasing depths, with careful supervision and logging of reactions. Diving organizations such as Global Underwater Explorers (GUE) emphasize that such sessions are {{for the purpose of}} gaining experience in recognizing the onset symptoms of narcosis for an individual , which are somewhat more repeatable than for the average group of divers. Scientific evidence does not show that a diver can train to overcome any measure of narcosis <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> depth or become tolerant of it.|$|E
5|$|Due to its perception-altering effects, {{the onset}} of {{narcosis}} {{may be hard to}} recognize. At its most benign, narcosis results in relief of anxiety– a feeling of tranquility and mastery of the environment. These effects are essentially identical to various concentrations of nitrous oxide. They also resemble (though not as closely) the effects of alcohol or cannabis and the familiar benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and alprazolam. Such effects are not harmful unless they cause some immediate danger to go unrecognized and unaddressed. Once stabilized, the effects generally remain the same <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> depth, only worsening if the diver ventures deeper.|$|E
5|$|Even {{interpreting}} the hydrogen data (including safety data) is confounded {{by a number}} of phenomena. Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the parahydrogen/orthohydrogen ratio (it often takes days or weeks <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the data is usually given). Hydrogen detonation parameters, such as critical detonation pressure and temperature, strongly depend on the container geometry.|$|E

5|$|In meteorology, station {{models are}} {{symbolic}} illustrations showing the weather occurring <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model {{to fit a}} number of weather elements into a small space on weather maps.

The most common station plots depict surface weather observations although upper air plots at various mandatory levels are also frequently depicted.|$|E

5|$|Most natural {{membranes}} are {{a complex}} mixture of different lipid molecules. If {{some of the}} components are liquid <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> temperature while others are in the gel phase, the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions, rather like an iceberg floating in the ocean. This phase separation plays {{a critical role in}} biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated. One particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol, which modulates bilayer permeability, mechanical strength, and biochemical interactions.|$|E
5|$|Now {{imagine a}} stack of {{hyperbolic}} disks where each disk represents {{the state of the}} universe <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> time.

Time runs along the vertical direction in this picture. The surface of this cylinder {{plays an important role in}} the AdS/CFT correspondence. As with the hyperbolic plane, anti-de Sitter space is curved in such a way that any point in the interior is actually infinitely far from this boundary surface.|$|E
