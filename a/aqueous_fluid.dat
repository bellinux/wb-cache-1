Partitioning of large-ion lithophile elements between <b>aqueous</b> <b>fluids</b> and melts is crucial as these two liquid phases are present in the sub-arc pressure-temperature conditions. Using a micro-focused synchrotron X-ray beam, in situ X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectra were obtained from <b>aqueous</b> <b>fluids</b> and haplogranite or jadeite melts at 0. 3 to 1. 3 GPa and 730 °C to 830 °C under varied concentrations of (Na, K) Cl (0 to 25 wt. %). Partition coefficients between the <b>aqueous</b> <b>fluids</b> and melts were calculated for Pb, Rb, and Sr (D fluid=melt Pb; Rb; Sr). There was a positive correlation between D fluid=melt Pb; Rb; Sr values and pressure, as well as D fluid=melt Pb; Rb; Sr values and salinity. As compared to the saline fluids with 25 wt. % (Na, K) Cl, the Cl-free <b>aqueous</b> <b>fluids</b> can only dissolve one tenth (Pb, Rb) to one fifth (Sr) of the amount of large-ion lithophile elements when they coexist with the melts. In the systems with 13 to 25 wt. % (Na, K) Cl, D fluid=melt Pb; Rb values were greater than unity, which is indicative of the capacity of such highly saline fluids to effectively transfer Pb and Rb. Enrichment of large-ion lithophile elements such as Pb and Rb in arc basalts relative to mid-oceanic ridge basalts (MORB) has been attributed to mantle source fertilization by <b>aqueous</b> <b>fluids</b> from dehydrating oceanic plates.

30|$|Hydrous subducted oceanic {{plates are}} {{eventually}} dehydrated by breakdown of hydrous phases such as serpentine, lawsonite, amphiboles, and micas, {{and as a}} result, H 2 O-rich fluids are released in the deep upper mantle (e.g., Poli and Schmidt 1995). Significant amounts of Na are likely dissolved to <b>aqueous</b> <b>fluids</b> released from hydrous subducted oceanic plates. Such Na-rich <b>aqueous</b> <b>fluids</b> could ascend to overlying mantle peridotites and cause metasomatism of primitive mantle lherzolite and websterite (the host rock of group A garnet in this study) at depths > 200  km. During mantle metasomatism, typical lherzolite and websterite may transform to pyroxenites. Hydrous Na-garnet probably forms in such metasomatized pyroxenites under Na-rich <b>aqueous</b> <b>fluids</b> environments.|$|R

The HDAC is sometimes used to examine aqueous complexes in solution using the synchrotron light source techniques XANES and EXAFS.

Since then, {{several types of}} implants have followed on from the original, the Baerveldt tube shunt, or the valved implants, such as the Ahmed glaucoma valve implant or the ExPress Mini Shunt and the later generation pressure ridge Molteno implants. These are indicated for glaucoma patients not responding to maximal medical therapy, with previous failed guarded filtering surgery (trabeculectomy). The flow tube is inserted into the anterior chamber of the eye, and the plate is implanted underneath the conjunctiva to allow a flow of <b>aqueous</b> <b>fluid</b> out of the eye into a chamber called a bleb.|$|E

30|$|<b>Aqueous</b> <b>fluids</b> are {{produced}} {{from the top}} of subducting plate (sedimentary cover, oceanic crust, hydrated mantle) by compaction of fractures and porosity, and by thermally induced dehydration reactions of minerals (Iwamori 1998; Peacock 1993; van Keken, et al. 2011). Vertical rise of the low-density fluids can be slowed down, impeded, or diverted by permeability barriers. Sediments like clay are well known for providing such barriers, and at depth, phyllosilicates of the clay, mica, and serpentine groups are abundant candidates for providing similar barriers. During ascent, <b>aqueous</b> <b>fluids</b> are also partly used for forming hydrated minerals (Peacock 1993).|$|R
30|$|H 2 O-rich fluids play {{significant}} {{roles in}} magma genesis and elemental recycling via subduction processes (Kushiro 1972; Green 1973; Perfit et al. 1980; Tatsumi and Eggins 1995; Keppler 1996; Bureau and Keppler 1999; Kawamoto 2006; Mibe et al. 2007; Kawamoto et al. 2012). The partitioning of large-ion lithophile {{elements such as}} Pb, Rb, and Sr between melts/crystals and <b>aqueous</b> <b>fluids</b> provides key information for estimating chemical features of slab-derived components because their abundances and isotopic compositions of Pb and Sr can distinguish subduction zone magmas from other types (Perfit et al. 1980; Tatsumi and Eggins 1995). In geochemical studies, three components are conventionally considered {{in the formation of}} arc basalts: the depleted mantle, an aqueous fluid-like component, and a melt-like component (Elliott et al. 1997; Pearce et al. 2005; Hanyu et al. 2012), the latter two being from downgoing slab materials. To understand arc basalt formation, it is important to assess the mixing ratios of slab-derived <b>aqueous</b> <b>fluids</b> and melts, and in order to do so, the partitioning of trace elements between melts and <b>aqueous</b> <b>fluids</b> must be determined.|$|R
30|$|Experimental data {{indicate}} that solubility of geochemically important minor and trace elements in <b>aqueous</b> <b>fluids</b> can be significantly affected by other silicate components (Manning 2007; Mysen 2012 a, b). This happens because the stability and concentration of minor and trace element complexes (oxy complexes) in fluids depend on the electronic properties of cations available for this purpose in the fluid (Mysen 2012 b, 2015 b). This means that when considering partitioning of such elements between minerals and <b>aqueous</b> <b>fluids</b> in the upper mantle and deep crust, pressure-dependent partition coefficients likely reflect changing silicate-cation interaction in the fluid {{as a function of}} silicate solubility and speciation.|$|R
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include blurry vision, redness of the eye, itchiness, and darkening of the iris. Latanoprost {{is in the}} {{prostaglandin}} analogue family of medication. It works by increasing the outflow of <b>aqueous</b> <b>fluid</b> from the eyes through the uveoscleral tract.|$|E

Water is instrumental in localising deformation, enabling tectonic response to plate motion; it also markedly decreases the melting temperature of silicate rocks and lowers the viscosity of silicate magmas. <b>Aqueous</b> <b>fluids</b> transport large quantities of dissolved material. Questions to answer in the future include: What determines where fluids go inside the Earth? What determines their quantity and rate of flow? What are the chemical effects of flowing fluids on the rocks and local fluids with which they interact? And what consequences are there for mineralisation and rock deformation...|$|R

This is particularly so in and near subduction zones where water-rich fluids released from dehydrating slab materials can transport chemical components into source regions of melting and, at the same time, deplete dehydrating slab materials of fluid-soluble components (Mibe et al. 2008; Kawamoto et al. 2012). In this environment, hydrated rocks ranging from amphibolite and peridotite to felsic gneiss compositions are subjected to dehydration and release of silicate-saturated water-rich fluids.|$|R
