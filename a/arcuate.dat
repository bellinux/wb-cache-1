5|$|The <b>arcuate</b> nucleus and the periventricular {{nucleus of}} the {{hypothalamus}} have dopamine neurons that form an important projection—the tuberoinfundibular pathway which goes to the pituitary gland, where it influences the secretion of the hormone prolactin. Dopamine is the primary neuroendocrine inhibitor of the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland. Dopamine produced by neurons in the <b>arcuate</b> nucleus is secreted into the hypophyseal portal system of the median eminence, which supplies the pituitary gland. The prolactin cells that produce prolactin, {{in the absence of}} dopamine, secrete prolactin continuously; dopamine inhibits this secretion. In the context of regulating prolactin secretion, dopamine is occasionally called prolactin-inhibiting factor, prolactin-inhibiting hormone, or prolactostatin.|$|E
5|$|The <b>arcuate</b> nucleus {{contains}} two distinct groups of neurons. The first group coexpresses neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH. The second group coexpresses pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and inhibitory inputs to the LH. Consequently, NPY/AgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety, while POMC/CART neurons stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding. Both groups of <b>arcuate</b> nucleus neurons are regulated {{in part by}} leptin. Leptin inhibits the NPY/AgRP group while stimulating the POMC/CART group. Thus a deficiency in leptin signaling, either via leptin deficiency or leptin resistance, leads to overfeeding and may account for some genetic and acquired forms of obesity.|$|E
5|$|The zona incerta, grouped {{between the}} <b>arcuate</b> and periventricular nuclei, {{projects}} to several {{areas of the}} hypothalamus, and participates in the control of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which is necessary to activate {{the development of the}} male and female reproductive systems, following puberty.|$|E

40|$|The {{inspection}} of schoolboys is conducted in age 7 - 10 years. For {{the estimation of}} force of muscles of hands and humeral belt tests were used: spray dynamometry, bending and unbending of hands in support lying; undercutting is in висе; вис on <b>arcuated</b> hands. The level of display of force was estimated in the different modes of operations of muscles. The most inspected schoolboys (44 %) rotined an unsatisfactory result at the estimation of force of сгибателей of brush, 27 % - satisfactory, 25 % - good and only 4 % - excellent.

5|$|Mimas is the {{smallest}} and least massive of the inner round moons, although its mass is sufficient to alter the orbit of Methone. It is noticeably ovoid-shaped, having been made shorter at the poles and longer at the equator (by about 20km) by the effects of Saturn's gravity. Mimas has a large impact crater one-third its diameter, Herschel, situated on its leading hemisphere. Mimas has no known past or present geologic activity, and its surface is dominated by impact craters. The only tectonic features known are a few <b>arcuate</b> and linear troughs, which probably formed when Mimas was shattered by the Herschel impact.|$|E
5|$|At Bremerton, on {{the east}} side of the Olympics, the {{measured}} rotations are less, and within the statistical error bounds of being zero; while further north, near Port Townsend, the rotation is slightly counter-clockwise. On Vancouver Island the paleorotations are counter-clockwise, and other evidence shows that the tip of the island has been bent, presumably as a result of the collision of Siletzia. The northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula also shows counter-clockwise rotation, of around 45 degrees. This raises a question of how much of the <b>arcuate</b> shape of the Crescent Formation is due to loss of material from the center after uplift by the Olympic Mountains, and how much reflects oroclinal bending.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} pathophysiological mechanisms {{involved in the}} development and maintenance of obesity. This field of research had been almost unapproached until the leptin gene was discovered in 1994 by J. M. Friedman's laboratory. While leptin and ghrelin are produced peripherally, they control appetite through their actions on the central nervous system. In particular, they and other appetite-related hormones act on the hypothalamus, a region of the brain central to the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. There are several circuits within the hypothalamus that contribute to its role in integrating appetite, the melanocortin pathway being the most well understood. The circuit begins with an area of the hypothalamus, the <b>arcuate</b> nucleus, that has outputs to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), the brain's feeding and satiety centers, respectively.|$|E

5|$|In 1939 some paving and {{the walls}} of two unusual {{elliptical}} buildings were discovered, one atop the other. These 'elliptical' buildings were partially uncovered behind Chester's market hall, and no similar buildings {{have been found in}} other legionary fortresses. The buildings were located near the centre of the fortress and they had their own bath buildings and a range of store rooms around the outside. The presence of a second bath building is unusual because legionary fortresses generally had just one set of internal baths. Construction on the site began around AD 77 and this was confirmed by a length of lead piping, which served a central water feature or fountain, which was stamped with the name of Emperor Vespasian. The first building was a prestigious edifice made with concrete foundations and finely dressed stonework, and was probably the finest building in the entire fortress. Technically speaking it was not elliptical, but <b>arcuate,</b> with the central hall being formed from two intersecting arcs, and this makes it unique in the Roman Empire. Its function is unknown. There was no seating within the arcs, which precludes a theatre, and the best guess of the archaeologists was that the twelve alcoves may have contained images of the gods, with the temple being dedicated to the twelve primary gods of the Roman pantheon. Or, alternatively, the oval shape may have represented the shape of the known Roman world, but there is no supporting evidence for this.|$|E
25|$|Normal puberty is {{initiated}} in the hypothalamus, with de-inhibition of the pulse generator in the <b>arcuate</b> nucleus. This inhibition of the <b>arcuate</b> nucleus {{is an ongoing}} active suppression by {{other areas of the}} brain. The signal and mechanism releasing the <b>arcuate</b> nucleus from inhibition {{have been the subject of}} investigation for decades and remain incompletely understood. Leptin levels rise throughout childhood and play a part in allowing the <b>arcuate</b> nucleus to resume operation. If the childhood inhibition of the <b>arcuate</b> nucleus is interrupted prematurely by injury to the brain, it may resume pulsatile gonadotropin release and puberty will begin at an early age.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of these basins is indicated by three criteria: (1) isolated massifs that appear to protrude through superposed materials; (2) <b>arcuate</b> segments of ridges (rupes) aligned with massif material; and (3) <b>arcuate</b> scarps aligned with both massifs and ridges.|$|E

25|$|Conduction aphasia {{is caused}} by damage to the <b>arcuate</b> {{fasciculus}}. The <b>arcuate</b> fasciculus is a white matter tract that connects Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas. Patients with conduction aphasia typically have good language comprehension, but poor speech repetition and mild difficulty with word retrieval and speech production. Patients with conduction aphasia are typically aware of their errors. The awareness of errors and the milder nature of conduction aphasia compared to other types contributes to a positive outcome. Additionally, a case study completed on a 54-year-old man with a large infarct in the <b>arcuate</b> fasciculus indicated that severe conduction aphasia can be successfully treated. Despite his global deficits, he made a full recovery after 30 months.|$|E

Palladio's contribution in the building is not immediately recognizable, even if the peculiar basement of <b>arcuated</b> portico, with its stone bosses, may derive from Palladio’s studies of the Roman antiquities in Dalmatia, specifically the amphitheatre in Pula. What seems probable is that the building’s execution was at least undertaken without Palladio’s control, and without particular respect for his original project.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: We {{modified}} the elastase-induced aneurysm model {{by use of}} a simple surgical technique in rabbits. A temporary <b>arcuated</b> aneurysm clip was placed at {{the origin of the}} right common carotid artery (RCCA), ascertaining the inner edge of the clip blade on the juncture of the RCCA and right subclavian artery (RSCA), and the elastase-induced aneurysm procedure was undertaken. We found elastase and location of the temporary <b>arcuated</b> aneurysm clip are {{critical to the success of}} this aneurysm model. The elastase-induced aneurysm model has been graduallyaccepted in recent years because it resembles a human an-eurysm in hemodynamics and histology. 1, 2 The creation of this model requires a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) machine and a disposable occlusion balloon. Moreover, infla-tion of the balloon at the origin of the right common carotid artery (RCCA) may also injure the intima of the brachioce-phalic artery and the origin of the RCCA. The aberrant origins of the branch to the trachea from the RCCA are areas through which elastase could pass and lethal hemorrhagic necrosis o...|$|R
25|$|Transcortical {{sensory aphasia}} {{is caused by}} lesions in the {{inferior}} left temporal lobe of the brain located near Wernicke's area, and is usually due to minor hemorrhage or contusion in the temporal lobe, or infarcts of the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA). One function of the <b>arcuate</b> fasciculus is the connection between Wernicke’s and Broca’s area. In TSA Wernicke’s and Broca’s areas are spared, meaning that lesions do not occur in these regions of the brain. However, since the <b>arcuate</b> fasciculus, Wernicke's area, and Broca's area are secluded {{from the rest of}} the brain in TSA, patients still have intact repetition (as information from the <b>arcuate</b> fasciculus is relayed to Broca’s area), but cannot attach meaning to words, either spoken or heard.|$|E

25|$|Planimetrically <b>arcuate</b> escarpments in the Discovery {{quadrangle}} cut intercrater {{plains and}} crater materials {{as young as}} c4. These scarps are typically 100 to 400km long and 0.5 to 1.0km high, and they have convex-upward slopes in cross section that steepen from brink to base. More trend closer to north-south than to east-west. Discovery (lat 55° S., long 38° W.), Vostok (lat 38° S., long 20° W.), Adventure (lat 64° S., long 63° W.), and Resolution (lat 63° S., long 52° W.) Rupes are the most prominent examples in the quadrangle. Vostok transects and foreshortens the crater Guido d'Arezzo, which suggests that <b>arcuate</b> scarps are compressional tectonic features (thrust or high-angle reverse faults). Melosh and Dzurisin have speculated that both <b>arcuate</b> scarps and the global mercurian lineament pattern may have formed {{as a result of}} simultaneous despinning and thermal contraction of Mercury.|$|E
