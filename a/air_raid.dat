5|$|When World WarII {{broke out}} in Europe, it was {{expected}} that the Japanese, who had already made aggressive moves against mainland China, would try to invade the Indies. In response, the Dutch colonial government– which had previously limited military training for native Indonesians– began teaching the populace how to deal with air raids. To co-ordinate the preparations, the Dutch formed <b>Air</b> <b>Raid</b> Preparation teams. Sudirman, respected in the community, was asked to lead the Cilacap chapter. Aside from teaching local citizens the safety procedures for dealing with an <b>air</b> <b>raid,</b> Sudirman established watchposts throughout the area. He and the Dutch would also have passing aircraft drop materials to simulate a bombing run; this was intended to improve response time.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the line}} {{was one of the}} most {{important}} railways in Germany, it was long spared from Allied <b>air</b> <b>raids.</b> Thus, although some stations in the southern section of the line became the target of <b>air</b> <b>raids</b> in 1944, in contrast to other routes, largely scheduled operations continued until 1945. It was only in April 1945 that the Elster Viaduct was partly blown up by the Wehrmacht, and the Saale viaduct (near Unterkotzau) was significantly damaged by <b>air</b> <b>raids.</b> Rail traffic came to a standstill and was resumed only after the end of the war.|$|R
