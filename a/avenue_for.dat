There, US41 is split along the one-way pairing of Sheldon <b>Avenue</b> <b>for</b> northbound and Montezuma <b>Avenue</b> <b>for</b> southbound traffic. The two streets merge west of downtown {{at the south end of}} the Portage Lake Lift Bridge. Downtown Houghton marks the start of the Copper Country Trail National Scenic Byway.|$|E

5|$|However, {{even among}} Senate Republicans, there were {{conflicting}} views. Senators Arlen Specter and Lindsey Graham (the latter a former military prosecutor) indicated Congress would work quickly to authorize tribunals, while influential Senator John Warner suggested a cautious and deliberative response. The potential for Congressional action also provided an <b>avenue</b> <b>for</b> politicking, as Republicans threatened Democratic members of Congress with being labeled weak on terrorism {{if they did}} not authorize tribunals.|$|E
5|$|NY376 follows Raymond <b>Avenue</b> <b>for</b> {{about a mile}} (1.6km) to {{the hamlet}} of Arlington. Here, it meets US44 and NY55, both of which follow a one-way couplet along Haight Street (eastbound) and Maple Street (westbound) through the city of Poughkeepsie. In between the two streets, NY376 intersects Main Street (CR114). The route ends upon {{intersecting}} westbound US44 and NY55, {{at which point the}} routing of NY376 becomes an unnumbered town road named Van Wagner Road.|$|E

5|$|The Northern Parkway is a controlled-access parkway in Glendale, near Luke AFB. Beginning at an {{interchange}} with Loop 303, {{it follows}} the Butler Drive alignment (half a mile south of Olive <b>Avenue)</b> <b>for</b> about 4 miles until turning southeast to align with Northern Avenue right before its current terminus at Dysart Road. It {{is intended to}} relieve heavy traffic on Northern Avenue, some being contributed by the nearby military base.|$|E
5|$|The Seventh Avenue Line Extension {{would extend}} the Broadway Line north from 59th Street via a tunnel under Central Park to 72nd Street, before turning east into Queens via Northern Boulevard to Jackson Heights. It {{was to have}} been built as a two-track and four-track line, and it would have cost $89,000,000. The second phase would extend the line as a two-track line along Corona Avenue and Horace Harding Boulevard from Jackson Heights to Marathon Parkway. A storage yard would be built. This phase would have cost $51,820,000. A {{connection}} between the new line and the Crosstown Line {{was to have been}} built at 23rd Street (Ely <b>Avenue)</b> <b>for</b> $10,950,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} was originally {{known as the}} McKernan Block, after John W. McKernan, the Princess’s owner and manager until 1919. The McKernans were a family of property developers in boomtown Strathcona; John’s father developed and ran the historically important Dominion Hotel, also on Whyte <b>Avenue.</b> <b>For</b> his part, J.W. McKernan is considered an important trailblazer in Edmonton entertainment. He opened two other south side theatres before the Princess, the South Side Gem and the South Side Bijou, both of which failed during the collapse of Strathcona's building boom in 1913.|$|E
5|$|The company {{continued}} to leave Rosebery <b>Avenue</b> <b>for</b> summer tours to British cities and towns. The Arts Council (successor to CEMA) was {{sensitive to the}} charge that since 1945, far fewer opera performances had been given in the provinces. The small Carl Rosa Opera Company toured constantly, but the Covent Garden company visited only those few cities with theatres big enough to accommodate it. In the mid-1950s, renewed calls appeared for a reorganisation of Britain's opera companies. There were proposals for a new home for Sadler's Wells on the South Bank of the Thames near the Royal Festival Hall, which fell through because the government was unwilling to fund the building.|$|E
5|$|The highway passes {{south of}} Wiggins Lake as it {{approaches}} the junction with M-18 in Gladwin. The two highways run concurrently on Cedar <b>Avenue</b> <b>for</b> approximately ten blocks through downtown. M-61 leaves {{town on the}} east side near the airport. The highway continues eastward to a junction with M-30 (Meridian Road) in White Star on the west banks of the Smallwood Lake section of the Tittabawassee River. The highway crosses the river and runs through Wooden Shoe Village as it continues through the Au Sable State Forest, crossing extreme northern Bay County. The trunkline crosses into Arenac County before meeting I-75 and US23 in Arenac County near Standish.|$|E

5|$|The inaugural parade route {{ran along}} Pennsylvania Avenue,N.W. from the U.S.Capitol, ending {{at the north}} face of the White House. During most of the parade, President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama {{traveled}} in the new armored limousine because of potential security threats.

Vice President Biden and his wife Jill walked the parade route at several points with their children Beau, Hunter and Ashley.|$|E
5|$|Valley Parade, {{also known}} as the Northern Commercials Stadium through {{sponsorship}} rights, is an all-seater football stadium in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. It was built in 1886, and was the home of Manningham Rugby Football Club until 1903, when they changed code from rugby football to association football and became Bradford City. It has been Bradford City's home since, although it is now owned by former chairman Gordon Gibb's pension fund. It has also been home to Bradford (Park <b>Avenue)</b> <b>for</b> one season, and Bradford Bulls rugby league side for two seasons, as well as host to a number of England youth team fixtures.|$|E
5|$|When built, the {{surrounding}} area was composed of dirt roads and private residences. The Southern Pacific Railroad's 1868 west side rail line ran down Fourth Avenue past City Hall and the county courthouse. The city and county governments fought the railroad to remove the dirty and noisy steam locomotives from this route, succeeding in 1912. Southern Pacific's electric interurban line continued on the tracks until the 1930s. In 2007, work began on adding light rail tracks on Fifth <b>Avenue</b> <b>for</b> the planned MAX Green Line, and trains once again ran past City Hall starting in 2009.|$|E

5|$|About 12,500 {{species of}} insects are native to Florida, {{most of which}} {{naturally}} flew into the region from the Caribbean or Southeastern United States. An additional 1,000 {{have been identified as}} exotic. Insects create about $1 billion of damage to structures and agriculture in Florida each year. The tide of arriving insects is nearly impossible to control with the volume of goods and shipments coming into South Florida. Imported citrus is a major <b>avenue</b> <b>for</b> damaging insects. Twenty-one species have been imported and released to act as biological control agents: to impede the growth of invasive plants or counter the effects of other insects. Others, such as the Madagascan hissing cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa) and European cricket (Acheta domesticus) are sold as pets or fishing bait, and are then released into backyards. Similarly, aquatic invertebrates such as mussels, clams, snails, and melania find their ways into local waters from the bottoms of ships or in bilge holds. The aquarium trade also supplies enthusiasts with exotic species which are dumped or escape into waterways.|$|E
5|$|Because of the disappointing {{box office}} {{performances}} of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules, Disney restricted its marketing campaign for Mulan spending $30 million on promotional advertisements compared {{to more than}} $60 million for Hercules the year before. Instead of the lavish media event premieres of Pocahontas in Central Park and the electric light parade on Fifth <b>Avenue</b> <b>for</b> Hercules, Disney opted to premiere the film at the Hollywood Bowl complete with Chinese lanterns and fortune cookies. Two days before the general release, McDonald's launched its promotional campaign by including one of eight toys free with {{the purchase of a}} Happy Meal. The promotion also included Szechuan sauce for its Chicken McNuggets, which would be referenced in a 2017 episode of the Adult Swim series Rick and Morty and subsequently brought back by McDonald's as a promotional item related to that show.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway 23 (Bus. US23) was a {{business}} loop through downtown Bay City. It started {{at the intersection of}} where US23 turned off Broadway Street westward onto Lafayette Avenue. From this point, Bus.

As it approached downtown, the business loop jogged off Garfield onto Washington Avenue. At the intersection with 7th Street, Bus. US23 turned westward to cross the Saginaw River. On the opposite side, the business loop followed Jenny Street westbound and Thomas Street eastbound along a one-way pairing of streets. At the intersection with US23 (Euclid Avenue), the business loop terminated.|$|E
