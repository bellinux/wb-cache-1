According to Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) General James L.

5|$|Roméo Dallaire, from October 1993 to August 1994, {{served as}} the Force Commander for the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda. In January 1994 he passed along {{information}} to the UN from a Hutu informant about a planned extermination of Tutsi citizens and a massacre of Belgian peacekeepers. After the UN denied him permission to protect the informant, or seize any weapons, Dallaire made <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>to</b> the Canadian government who also denied him any assistance. Dallaire continued his pleas to the UN after the genocide began and devised a plans to end the violence. The UN ordered the peacekeepers to withdraw and not interfere. Dallaire, believing the order unethical and unlawful, disobeyed and with 450 Ghanaian soldiers, protected Tutsi hideouts. He received help from non-governmental organizations, foreign journalists, and the Canadian government. With the media reporting on the massacre, the UN authorized 5,500 troops to protect civilians. Dallaire was denied permission to arrest fleeing Hutu leaders. In August Dallaire asked to be replaced after he recognized signs of posttraumatic stress disorder. Once back in Canada, he became appalled at how little the general public knew, and how much the world leaders knew, of what happened. In the aftermath, blame was assigned to various people, including Dallaire, but Off argues that blame lies with the UN and its Security Council who refused to act when called upon.|$|E

Shaftesley's plea was ignored by some, and during the bank holiday weekend, which began on August 1, 1947, and throughout the following week, British Jews across the country felt the powerful impact of the Irgun murders, facing a sharp rise in hatred, abuse and ultimately rioting.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanisms}} of evolution are taught transparently by showing {{the advantages of}} various types of plant behaviour in action. The adaptations are often complex, as {{it becomes clear that}} the environment to which plants must adapt comprises not just soil, water and weather, but also other plants, fungi, insects and other animals, and even humans. The series shows that co-operative strategies are often much more effective than predatory ones, as these often lead to the prey developing methods of self-defence — from plants growing spikes to insects learning to recognise mimicry. Yet humans can work around all these rules of nature, so Attenborough concludes with <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>to</b> preserve plants, in the interest of self-preservation.|$|E

The opening chapter of the book nicely sets the tone of the satirical nature of what is to follow, with Droogstoppel articulating his pompous and mercenary world-view at length. At {{the very end of the}} novel Multatuli himself takes the pen and the book culminates in a vocal denunciation of Dutch colonial policies and <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>to</b> the king of the Netherlands to intervene on behalf of his Indonesian subjects.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, the Illinois Senator made {{headlines}} when she convinced the Senate Judiciary Committee not to renew a design patent for the United Daughters of the Confederacy because it contained the Confederate flag.

Moseley Braun threatened to filibuster the legislation “until this room freezes over.” She also made <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>to</b> her colleagues about the symbolism of the Confederate flag, declaring, “It has no place in our modern times, place in this body, place in our society.” Swayed by Moseley Braun’s argument, the Senate rejected the UDC’s application to renew its patent.|$|E
25|$|More recently, Persian {{has become}} {{just one of}} many Iranian blog languages. English in {{particular}} is used.

Several influential bloggers made <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>to</b> other bloggers to use this medium to increase international outrage at the Iranian regime. It also seeks to provide a lens from which to see the Iranian people as separate from their repressive government. Additionally, many blogs being read are written abroad by diasporic communities of Iranians throughout the globe. Many of their families left during the Brain-drain following the Islamic revolution in 1979 and after, creating a dedicated politically motivated and educated author base. These people use their native or adopted languages in addition to Persian.|$|E
