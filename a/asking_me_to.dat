Do you believe in God? I doubt that you believe in Him and that love humanity, if you would, then you wouldn't lead his unfortunate soldiers right here to a senseless slaughter, and to certain death, {{and you would have}} spared them, their wives and children, and made them to live quietly at home instead of having led them such a distance because of the pernicious whims of your king.|$|E
25|$|Seeing {{that there}} are many reasons for expounding the Madhyamakalankara, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, our {{incomparable}} guide, unbounded in his kindness, whose very name I hardly dare to pronounce, who is the very personification of the compassion of the abbot Bodhisattva, of the master Padmasambhava, and of King Trisongdetsen, who is the sovereign among the learned and accomplished, who is supreme Manjushri appearing {{in the form of a}} monk in saffron robes, and whose renown fills the world, gave to me the Indian and Tibetan commentaries on the Madhyamakalankara, <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> study them well and to compose a commentary. And as his diamondlike injunction came down upon my head, I earnestly gave myself to the task.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} claimed that Epstein became exasperated with Best's refusal {{to adopt the}} mop-top-style Beatle haircut {{as part of their}} unified look keeping his quiffed hairstyle, {{although}} Best later stated that he was never asked to change his hairstyle. In a 1995 BBC Radio Merseyside interview, Kirchherr explained: [...] "My boyfriend, Klaus Voormann, had this hairstyle, and Stuart [...] liked it very, very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the Brylcreem out of his hair, and <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> cut his hair for him. Pete Best has really curly hair, and it wouldn't work".|$|E

500|$|Nicolas Cage {{was cast}} as Al Columbato. He reflected, [...] "I {{was terrified of}} the role of Al, because it was like nothing I'd ever done before, and I didn't know how to get to the places the role was <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go emotionally." [...] For scenes in which Al's face is {{disfigured}} and swathed in bandages, Cage lost 15 pounds and had two of his front teeth pulled out. [...] "I wanted to look like I was hit by a bomb," [...] he said. [...] "It gave me a feeling of something I had lost. I felt this was a once-in-a-lifetime part, and it deserved that much." ...|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr is {{credited}} with inventing the Beatles' moptop haircut, although she personally disagrees. In 1995, she told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "All my friends in art school used to run around {{with this sort of}} what you call Beatles' haircut, and my boyfriend then, Klaus Voormann, had this hairstyle, and Stuart [...] liked it very very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the Brylcreem out of his hair and <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> cut his hair for him. Pete [...] has really curly hair and it wouldn't work." [...] After suffering blackouts and intense headaches, Sutcliffe was taken to a hospital on 10 April 1962—Kirchherr rode with him in the ambulance—but died before the ambulance reached the hospital. Three days later Kirchherr met the Beatles at the Hamburg airport and told them Sutcliffe had died of a brain haemorrhage.|$|E
500|$|Parasite Eve was {{the first}} of her {{projects}} to include a vocal theme, the ending theme [...] "Somnia Memorias". This was because the PlayStation system {{was the first}} to have sufficient processing power for this to be possible. For the vocalist, Shimomura avoided using someone well known. [...] "Somnia Memorias" [...] was sung by Shani Rigsbee, while the vocals for the orchestrated versions of [...] "Influence of Deep" [...] and [...] "Se il Mio Amore Sta Vincino" [...] were provided by Judith Siirila. [...] "Somnia Memorias" [...] was translated and adapted from Japanese into Latin by Raul Ferrando, while [...] "Se il Mio Amore Sta Vincino" [...] was translated by Daniella Spagnolo. The lyrics for all vocal pieces were written by Shimomura.

This sentence prevented his ever applying again to any of Mississippi's all-white colleges. Roberts was given five years' probation and freed. In 2005, when an investigation was re-opened into the case, Roberts testified under oath that Kennard was innocent: [...] "Kennard did not <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> steal, Kennard did not <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> break into the co-op, Kennard did not <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do anything illegal." ...|$|R

500|$|Kirchherr is {{credited}} with inventing the Beatles' moptop haircut although she disagrees, saying: [...] "All that rubbish people said, that I created their hairstyle, that's rubbish! Lots of German boys had that hairstyle. Stuart [...] had {{it for a long}} while and the others copied it. I suppose the most important thing I contributed to them was friendship." [...] In 1995, Kirchherr told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "All my friends in art school used to run around with this sort of what you call Beatles haircut. And my boyfriend then, Klaus Voormann, had this hairstyle, and Stuart liked it very very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the Brylcreem out of his hair and <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> cut his hair for him. Pete [...] has really curly hair and it wouldn't work." [...] Kirchherr says that after she cut Sutcliffe's hair, Harrison asked her to do the same when she was visiting Liverpool, and Lennon and McCartney had their hair cut in the same style while they were in Paris, by Kirchherr's friend, Vollmer, who was living there at the time as an assistant to photographer William Klein.|$|E
500|$|Letters {{began to}} pour in for her {{from all over}} the country. There were mostly propositions from men, but the letters from women thanked her profusely and begged her for {{reassurance}} that they would be all right. Bannon described the impact her books had from the letters she received from people who were isolated in small towns: [...] "The most important things they learned (from the books) were that 1) they weren't unique and doomed to lifelong isolation, 2)... they weren't 'abnormal,' and 3) there was hope for a happy life. They wrote to me in thousands, <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> confirm these wonderful things, which I gladly did—even though I felt only marginally better informed than they were." [...] The books were even translated into other languages, which was also quite rare for the brief lives of pulp novels. Bannon received international and domestic mail from women, saying, [...] "This is the only book (and they would say this about all of them) that I've read where the women really love each other, where its OK for them to love each other, and they don't have to kill themselves afterwards." ...|$|E
500|$|A pre-taped {{performance}} of Brown performing {{a medley of}} [...] "Beautiful People" [...] and [...] "Forever" [...] was shown on the American version of Dancing with the Stars on March 29, 2011. For the performance Brown wore {{a black and white}} suit, and was accompanied by a group of robotic dancers dressed in all-white suits adorned with LED lighting for a futuristic Tron-like affect. Prior to the performance some of the show's cast were unhappy that Brown was going to perform because of the domestic violence assault that occurred with his then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009. Brown was sentenced to five years of probation, ordered to complete more than 1,400 hours of community service and was given a restraining order which required him to stay away from Rihanna. Professional dancer Cheryl Burke told Extra, [...] "As a victim of domestic violence, I don't agree with him coming on the show, but it's out of my control", while host Tom Bergeron told the On Air with Ryan Seacrest radio show that, [...] "I did tell the producers it may be to their advantage to not have me interview him, because my natural tendency would be to say something.

For the performance, Brown wore a tomato red tuxedo and a black shirt and bow tie. The performance started off with a young boy doing break dancing moves and announcing, 'Here is Chris Brown'. Brown then appeared doing flips and somersaults, as he lip-synced most of the song. The performance earned him a standing ovation from the judges {{and members of the}} crowd. Prior to the performance, some of the show's cast were unhappy that Brown was going to perform because of the domestic violence assault that occurred with his then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009.

500|$|An Argyle Hall of Famer {{returned}} to Home Park on 18 October 2009, when former England international Paul Mariner was appointed as the club's new head coach. [...] "In football, {{there is not}} much sentiment. But, if sentiment is involved in this scenario, then they gave me my very first chance as a player so I grabbed it with both hands," [...] said Mariner on the New England Revolution website, the club he left to rejoin Argyle. [...] "Plymouth Argyle are in my blood. Obviously the teams you're associated with are the ones you look for every week, and when they came knocking on my door <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be employed there, I was delighted." [...] His first match in the dugout alongside Sturrock ended in disappointment as Argyle lost 3–1 to Bristol City at Ashton Gate. They faced Ipswich Town, another side struggling for form, at home in their next match and a first-half goal from Fletcher put Argyle ahead, but their hopes of claiming three points were dented when the visitors equalised through striker Jon Stead, who capitalised on a poor back pass from Gary Sawyer. Welshman Darcy Blake, on loan from Cardiff City, was shown a straight red card late in the game as it ended all square. Their final game of October took place on Halloween against Middlesbrough, in Gordon Strachan's first game as their new manager. Argyle came away from the Riverside Stadium with all three points, in a game that saw Adam Johnson miss from the penalty spot, thanks to a second-half goal from Mackie to lift them to 22nd in the league table, within three points of Doncaster Rovers.|$|E
