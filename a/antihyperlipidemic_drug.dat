40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a condition}} of increased blood glucose level in the body. <b>Antihyperlipidemic</b> <b>drugs</b> like statins and fibrates are widely used for prophylactic treatment in dyslipideamia and atherosclerosis. Diabetic dislipidemia exists with increased triglycerides, low HDL and high LDL levels. Hence, with oral hypoglycemic drugs, {{the addition of a}} lipid-lowering drug is necessary for controlling dislipidemia. In such a situation, there may be chances of drug–drug interactions between antidiabetic and <b>antihyperlipidemic</b> <b>drugs.</b> The present study is planned to evaluate the safety of gliclazide (antidiabetic) in the presence of pravastatin and gemfibrozil (antihyperlpidemic) in rats. Studies in normal and alloxan-induced diabetic rats were conducted with oral doses of gliclazide and their combination with pravastatin and gemfibrozil, with an adequate washout period in between the treatments. Blood samples were collected in rats by retroorbital puncture at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h. All the blood samples were analyzed for glucose by GOD –POD. Gliclazide (½ TD) produced hypoglycemic activity in normal and diabetic rats, with peak activity at 2 and 8 h. Pravastatin (TD) + gemfibrozil (TD) combination treatment increased the hypoglycemic effect of gliclazide in normal rats or diabetic rats when administered together. The interaction observed due to inhibition of both the enzymes (CYP 450 2 C 9 and CYP 450 3 A 4) responsible for the metabolism of gliclazide showed increased half-life, which was seen in the present study.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Direct {{assessment}} of the vascular lesions of model animals in vivo {{is important for the}} development of new antiatherosclerotic drugs. Nevertheless, biochemical analysis of the lipid profile in blood in vitro remains the most common way to evaluate the therapeutic effect of drugs targeting atherosclerosis because of an inherent difficulty to access the vascular wall.

For demonstration, we investigated two commonly prescribed <b>antihyperlipidemic</b> <b>drugs,</b> ezetimibe and atorvastatin. The treatment of ezetimibe or atorvastatin alone decreased effectively the deposition of lipids in the vascular wall, and a combined dose showed a synergistic effect. Atorvastatin exerted a profound antioxidative effect on vascular fatty lesions. Analysis of individual lesions shows further that these lesions exhibited a heterogeneous response to the treatment of atorvastatin; a significant fraction of, but not all, the lesions became nonoxidized after the intervention.

Polyoxyethylene–polypropylene block copolymer (poloxamer 188) was employed as a hydrophilic carrier to prepare simvastatin solid dispersions (SDs). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffractometry were employed to understand the interaction between the drug and the carrier in the solid state. The results obtained from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed absence of any chemical interaction between the drug and poloxamer. The results of differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffractometry confirmed the conversion of simvastatin to distorted crystalline state. The SD of 1 : 2 w/w drug to carrier ratio showed the highest dissolution; hence, it was incorporated in RDT formulations using a 32 full factorial design and response surface methodology. The initial assessments of RDTs demonstrated an acceptable flow, hardness, and friability to indicate good mechanical strength. The interaction and Pareto charts indicated that percentage of croscarmellose sodium incorporated was the most important factor affecting the disintegration time and dissolution parameter followed by the hardness value and their interaction effect. Compression force showed a superior influence to increase RDT’s porosity and to fasten disintegration rather than swelling action by croscarmellose sodium. On the other hand, croscarmellose sodium was most important for the initial simvastatin release.

The results were analyzed by the use of SPSS software, ver. 16. From the week six on, the weights of the rats from the experimental group two (high, 2 %, cholesterol diet plus 1. 7 mg/ml Teucrium polium hydroalcoholic extract) showed a significant decrease (P< 0. 05) even in comparison to the control group (ordinary diet). The serum level of triglycerides, cholesterol and LDL-c was found significantly decreased in the experimental group two (P< 0. 001) as compared to Sham group but it did not any significant change in contrast to the control group. In experimental group one (high, 2 %, cholesterol dietary regime plus 0. 85 mg/ml Teucrium polium hydroalcoholic extract), only the cholesterol and TG serum levels were found significantly decreased in respect to the sham group (P< 0. 05 and P< 0. 001, respectively). Regarding the lipoprotein amount, a significant increase was documented in the experimental group two, featuring high density cholesterol (HDL-c), in contrast to the sham group (P< 0. 001). The present study’s findings indicated that an appropriate dosage of T. Polium can cause the regulation of lipid profile as well as the weights of the hypercholesterolemic rats. According to the side effects of the chemical drugs similar in their functions to the effect of T. polium, it can be suggested as an <b>antihyperlipidemic</b> <b>drug.</b> Keywords: Hyperlipidemic, Teucrium polium, Lipid profile, Medical plants, Rat...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To provide {{information}} on the prevalence of use of cardiovascular drugs, {{some of which may}} have fetotoxic or teratogenic effects, in the outpatient setting among pregnant women in the United States. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted using the automated databases of seven health plans participating in the HMO Research Network Center for Education and Research on Therapeutics (CERT). Women who delivered an infant from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2005 were identified. Cardiovascular drug use was evaluated assuming a gestational duration of 270 days. RESULTS: During the period 2001 through 2005, 118, 935 deliveries were identified that met the criteria for study; 3. 1 % of women (N = 3672) were dispensed an antihypertensive medication and 0. 12 % of women (N = 146) were dispensed an antihyperlipidemic medication at any time during pregnancy. The most common antihypertensive drugs dispensed during pregnancy were nifedipine (1219 deliveries; 1. 0 %), methyldopa (961 deliveries; 0. 8 %), atenolol (593 deliveries; 0. 5 %), and labetalol (576 deliveries; 0. 5 %). Overall, 134 women (0. 11 %) received an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and 7 women (0. 006 %) received an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) during pregnancy. Statins were the most commonly dispensed <b>antihyperlipidemic</b> <b>drugs</b> (71 deliveries; 0. 06 %). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of use of cardiovascular drugs that are suspected to be fetotoxic or teratogenic (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and statins) was low in this cohort of pregnant women. Differing patterns of use across health plans suggests that {{further research is needed to}} evaluate the potential differential effects of cardiovascular drugs to assist prescribers and patients in making informed treatment decisions...|$|R
40|$|Background Atherosclerosis, the {{underlying}} cause of heart attack, stroke and peripheral disease, is a main cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} worldwide. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia are independent factors in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. The atherosclerotic index (AI) is a strong indicator of cardiovascular heart disease. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the relationship between lipid serum level and AI in subjects 50 - 70 years of age. Methods A study of cross-sectional design was conducted among male and female subjects 50 - 70 years of age. The inclusion criteria were: healthy, and capable of active communication. The exclusion criteria were: subjects not completing the study, currently consuming <b>antihyperlipidemic</b> <b>drugs.</b> Lipid profile comprising total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, and malondialdehyde (MDA), was analyzed using commercial kits. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and body mass index was measured in all subjects. Atherogenic index was calculated from (total cholesterol – HDL cholesterol) / HDL cholesterol. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the data. Results Mean age of the subjects was 60. 6 ± 3. 30 years and there was a significant relationship of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides with AI (b= 0. 009; p= 0. 000 and b= 0. 008; p= 0. 000, respectively). Triglyceride level was the most influencing factor for AI (b= 0. 008; Beta= 0. 616; p= 0. 000) Conclusions Higher triglyceride levels increase AI in subjects 50 - 70 years of age. Subjects with high serum triglyceride level but without symptoms of cardiovascular disease should be examined for the development of coronary artery blockage...|$|R
40|$|Non-alcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) is {{characterized}} by hepatic triglyceride accumulation, ranging from steatosis to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. NAFLD is {{a risk factor for}} cardiovascular diseases and is associated with metabolic syndrome. <b>Antihyperlipidemic</b> <b>drugs</b> are recommended as part of the treatment for NAFLD patients. Although fibrates activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), leading to the reduction of serum triglyceride levels, the effects of these drugs on NAFLD remain controversial. Clinical studies have reported that PPARα activation does not improve hepatic steatosis. In the present study, we focused on exploring the effect and mechanism of PPARα activation on hepatic triglyceride accumulation and hepatic steatosis. Male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice, Pparα-null mice and HepG 2 cells were treated with fenofibrate, one of the most commonly used fibrate drugs. Both low and high doses of fenofibrate were administered. Hepatic steatosis was detected through oil red O staining and electron microscopy. Notably, in fenofibrate-treated mice, the serum triglyceride levels were reduced and the hepatic triglyceride content was increased in a dose-dependent manner. Oil red O staining of liver sections demonstrated that fenofibrate-fed mice accumulated abundant neutral lipids. Fenofibrate also increased the intracellular triglyceride content in HepG 2 cells. The expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 c (SREBP- 1 c) and the key genes associated with lipogenesis were increased in fenofibrate-treated mouse livers and HepG 2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. However, the effect was strongly impaired in Pparα-null mice treated with fenofibrate. Fenofibrate treatment induced mature SREBP- 1 c expression via the direct binding of PPARα to the DR 1 motif of the SREBP- 1 c gene. Taken together, these findings indicate the molecular mechanism by which PPARα activation increases liver triglyceride accumulation and suggest an adverse effect of fibrates on the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In {{previous}} studies, {{we successfully}} designed complex multicompartmental microcapsules {{as a platform}} for the oral targeted delivery of lipophilic drugs in type 2 diabetes (T 2 D). Probucol (PB) is an <b>antihyperlipidemic</b> and antioxidant <b>drug</b> {{with the potential to}} show benefits in T 2 D. We aimed to create a novel microencapsulated formulation of PB and to examine the shape, size, and chemical, thermal, and rheological properties of these microcapsules in vitro. Method: Microencapsulation was carried out using the Büchi-based microencapsulating system developed in our laboratory. Using the polymer, sodium alginate (SA), empty (control, SA) and loaded (test, PB-SA) microcapsules were prepared at a constant ratio (1 : 30). Complete characterizations of microcapsules, in terms of morphology, thermal profiles, dispersity, and spectral studies, were carried out in triplicate. Results: PB-SA microcapsules displayed uniform and homogeneous characteristics with an average diameter of 1 mm. The microcapsules exhibited pseudoplastic-thixotropic characteristics and showed no chemical interactions between the ingredients. These data were further supported by differential scanning calorimetric analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectral studies, suggesting microcapsule stability. Conclusion: The new PB-SA microcapsules have good structural properties and may be suitable for the oral delivery of PB in T 2 D.
