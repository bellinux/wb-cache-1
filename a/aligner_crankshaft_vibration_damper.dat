5000|$|Most {{high-speed}} inline {{internal combustion}} engines {{are prone to}} torsional vibration of their crankshafts; the straight six and straight eight engines being particularly prone to this problem due to their long crankshaft length. Although straight eight engines faded from the marketplace in the 1950s, many straight six engines have and still do feature <b>crankshaft</b> <b>vibration</b> <b>damping</b> utilizing rubber bushes. The 3,442 cc Jaguar XK 6-cylinder engine of 1948 and most subsequent versions of the ubiquitous Jaguar XK engine used a proprietary Metalastik <b>vibration</b> <b>damper</b> to protect their crankshafts from potentially damaging torsional vibrations. To quote William Heynes, [...] "The Metalastik damper consists of a steel plate to which is bonded, through a thick rubber disk, a malleable iron floating weight. Variations of the weight, rubber volume and mix, give these dampers a very wide field over which they can operate." ...|$|R

He became {{a friend of}} Rudyard Kipling and would send him experimental models to test. In 1905, Lanchester produced a [...] four-cylinder engine, and in 1906 he produced a [...] six-cylinder engine. Although Sir Henry Royce had already tackled the problem of crankshaft torsional oscillation and consequent vibration in straight-6 engines, Lanchester analysed the problem scientifically and invented the torsional <b>crankshaft</b> <b>vibration</b> <b>damper</b> {{as a solution to}} the problem of engine balance. His design, patented in 1907, used a secondary flywheel coupled to the end of the crankshaft with a viscous clutch. At around the same time Lanchester also patented a harmonic balancer to cancel out the unbalanced secondary forces in a four-cylinder engine, using two balance weights rotating at twice crankshaft speed in opposite directions.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe pulleys of an {{automotive}} {{front engine}} accessory drive are driven in rotation by a poly-V belt itself {{driven by the}} crankshaft pulley. This driving pulley is often used as a torsional <b>vibration</b> <b>damper</b> (TVD) for the crankshaft. Three elements compose the pulley: the hub, a rubber ring and an inertia steel ring with v-ribs on its outer diameter. Although the <b>crankshaft</b> torsional <b>vibrations</b> are dampen, they are transmitted to the belt transmission and therefore to the driven accessories. Hence, recent developments have conducted to add a decoupling function to these pulleys. The decoupling is realized by an other rubber ring. The TVD pulley components are designed in order to dampen <b>crankshaft</b> <b>vibrations</b> over a given frequency range, i. e. stiffness and damping characteristics are determined for the rubber ring. These expected characteristics have to be checked after manufacturing for product certification but also to give some real measured data input for simulation models.

40|$|Torsional <b>vibration</b> of <b>crankshaft</b> is a harmful {{phenomenon}} in {{every type of}} engine. It can easily cause a fatigue failure in engines with relatively long crankshafts and big bore diameters (usually above 90 mm). For these types of engines, the resonance caused by specific low order harmonic of gas force and inertia force of oscillating masses occurs in engine speed range, thus resonant torsional moment of big amplitude is generated. This moment, additionally acting on crankshaft, is harmful and can easily cause its fatigue failure. In {{order to reduce the}} resonance effects, the torsional <b>vibration</b> <b>damper</b> (TVD) has to be used. That is the reason why application of torsional vibration dampers is almost a rule in these types of engines. The viscose TVD is the most popular type of <b>vibration</b> <b>damper</b> in heavy duty diesel engine. Moment of inertia of its plunger is the main criterion of damper selection. It is the basic factor, which determines the amount of dissipation work, decreasing the additional torsional moment caused by resonance. Increasing plunger’s moment of inertia induce the rise of dissipation work but simultaneously decrease natural frequencies of a crank train, what allows to resonate with low order harmonic of tangential force acting on crankpin. The paper concerns an analysis of influence of viscose TVD parameters on <b>crankshaft’s</b> torsional <b>vibration</b> for six cylinder inline heavy duty diesel engine...|$|R
