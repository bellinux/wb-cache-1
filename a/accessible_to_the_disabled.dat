500|$|Shortly {{after the}} game's release, it was {{reported}} that the game's font-size had been formatted {{in such a way as}} to make in-game text difficult to read on standard definition televisions. Representatives from BioWare stated that the issue was a design choice instead of a bug. Mark Barlet, president of the website AbleGamers, which advocates for making games more <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>disabled,</b> observed that [...] "It's not just the size of the text of Mass Effect 2 that is the problem, it's the coloring of the text" [...] that is the problem. After investigating the complaints further, BioWare released a statement acknowledging that [...] "on some standard definition TVs the smallest text in Mass Effect 2 can be difficult to read", and concluded that they were unable to resolve it through a title update. However, they stated that they would take it into consideration for future games.|$|E

Students have access to federal, state, county, city, and local agencies, courts, correctional facilities, law firms, and legal aid organizations in the Portland area. Portland is the major urban and legal center in the state.

40|$|Galveston is a {{small city}} with {{numerous}} tourist attractions: museums, historical buildings, the beach, Moody Gardens, and several festivals each year. This research investigates if these tourist attractions are <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> elderly and <b>disabled.</b> <b>The</b> issue is particularly important because tourism represents the great-est possible source for economic growth in Galveston. According <b>to</b> estimates of <b>the</b> “Baby Boom ” generation moving toward retirement, the number of potential tour-ists in the population who will require accessible attractions will increase. Other research has also shown that many individuals with disabilities focus on accessible tourism such as “leisure ” trips that serve to immeasurably enhance their quality of life. Based on this research, recommendations are made for future action for the city, the historical foundation, and service providers who rely on tourist dollars. Galveston Island has unique physical characteristics, {{a large number of}} histori-cal buildings, a beach, plus a history of hurricanes. These characteristics make accessibility difficult for certain properties...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the final product of the first comprehensive, {{empirical}} analysis of electronic voting systems in the United States. It comes after nearly two years of study {{with many of the}} nations leading academics, election officials, economists, and security, usability and accessibility experts. Up until this point, there has been surprisingly little empirical study of voting systems in the areas of security, accessibility, usability, and cost. The result is that jurisdictions make purchasing decisions and adopt laws and procedures that {{have little to do with}} their overall goals. The Brennan Center analysis finds that there is not yet any perfect voting system or set of procedures. One system might be more affordable, but less <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> members of <b>the</b> <b>disabled</b> community; certain election procedures might make <b>the</b> systems easier <b>to</b> use, but they compromise security. Election officials and community members should be aware of the trade-offs when choosing one voting system or set of procedures over another, and they should know how <b>to</b> improve <b>the</b> system they choose. Included in this full report is an executive summary of the Brennan Centers analysis of voting system security, voting system usability, as well as voting system accessibility and cost. The Brennan Center analysis of cost is in part based upon a review of voting system contracts provided by jurisdictions around the country and a cost calculator [no longer available]. The cost calculator and contracts should assist jurisdictions in determining the initial on ongoing costs of various voting systems...|$|R
