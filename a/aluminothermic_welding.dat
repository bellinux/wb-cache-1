50|$|Before {{the rail}} is joined, its length must be {{adjusted}} very accurately. This {{ensures that the}} thermal stresses in the rail after it is joined into one continuous piece do not exceed certain limits, resulting in lateral kinks (in hot weather) or fractures (in cold weather). The joining operation is performed by an <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>welding</b> machine which {{is equipped with a}} rail saw, a weld shear and a grinder. When the thermite welding process is complete, the weld is ground to the profile of the rail, resulting in a seamless join between rail sections. Stress in the rail due to temperature variations is absorbed without longitudinal strain, except near bridges where an expansion joint is sometimes used.|$|E
30|$|<b>Aluminothermic</b> <b>welding</b> of rails {{is widely}} used within the railway {{industry}} for in-track welding during re-railing operations and defect removal [3]. The process suffers from variable quality in finished welds due to inherent limitations in the field. Under high axle load conditions, the recent failures in aluminothermic welds represent {{one of the main}} risks for a catastrophic derailment and a major limitation to further increases in axle loads. Improved rail welding and track maintenance practices would be required to meet the performance demands of higher axle loads.|$|E
40|$|A welded railway switch is {{a railway}} switch without {{interior}} rail joints, but {{which has the}} rail joints at the ends. By {{the elimination of the}} rail joints at the ends of a railway switch using the <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>welding</b> method or flash butt welding method the welded railway switch is included in continuous welded rail track, and all discontinuities caused by presence of gap on the rail joints are eliminated.

40|$|Severe {{head wear}} {{combined}} with a transverse defect is considered as an increased risk for rail safety and integrity, and reverse detail fracture (i. e. transverse defects which initiate at the lower corner of the gauge face of heavily worn rail) could be produced. This defect type as observed in poorly lubricated, heavily worn curved rails on stiff track subjected to high axle loads is shown in Fig 1 [1, 2]. Such failures which initiate at the underhead radius at <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>welds</b> are found in heavy axle load railway operation in Australia. Although, the weld normally has the lower material strength, the elevated residual stress levels and the complex geometry leading to stress concentration, the reverse detail fracture occasionally seen in <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>welds</b> but generally occur in the rail underhead...|$|R
40|$|<b>Aluminothermic</b> rail <b>welds</b> {{typically}} {{exhibit a}} variable and often inferior performance {{when compared with}} flash butt welds. Fatigue failure {{as a result of}} surface defects or harsh geometric features in the presence of high axle loads and tractive forces gives rise to the so-called straight break and horizontal split web fractures. In this study, the reduction of fatigue performance due to geometric irregularities is investigated using a multi-axial high cycle fatigue criterion based on the critical plane concept. A thermo-structural finite element model of a track containing an <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>weld</b> is linked with a developed computer code to perform fatigue crack initiation analysis. Two geometrically different <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>welds,</b> one of which is widely used in Australian heavy haul railways, are investigated in terms of fatigue probability, to facilitate a better insight into the effect of weld collar shape and geometry {{at the edge of the}} weld collar on fatigue behaviour. The results confirm that the amount of fatigue damage is critically dependent on the geometric features of the collar edge, especially at the underhead radius which undergoes severe fatigue loading under some operational conditions...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue crack {{initiation}} analysis is {{performed at the}} edge of the weld collar of an <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>weld,</b> in order to examine one of the failure modes that occur in this weld type under high axle load conditions. Since the stress state is multi-axial and the stress history involves rotating principal stresses, a shear based multi-axial fatigue criterion based on the concept of critical plane is exploited. It is believed that the material distress as a result of wheel-rail contact, bending, residual and seasonally-dependent thermal stresses, as well as the geometrical features associated with the weld collar, would directly influence the location of fatigue {{crack initiation}} and the severity of damage. The fatigue assessment is performed using thermo-structural finite element analysis followed by the Dang Van multi-axial fatigue criterion implemented as a customized computer code. The method is applied to investigate the effect of operational parameters including the conditions of vehicle hunting or curving, residual stress, seasonally-dependent variations in rail temperature, and deficiencies in track support conditions in the vicinity of <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>welds.</b> The finite element simulation is validated through strain gauge measurements, and the results of fatigue analysis are compared with the locations of fatigue cracking and failure modes that occur in-service...|$|R
40|$|Because {{the rail}} joints have gaps, impacts occur when a railway wheel {{encounters}} these discontinuities. In case of railway switches the vertical interaction forces between wheels and rail are amplified by presence of major discontinuities in frog of switch area. These large impact forces may cause damage to wheel, track and vehicle. A modern solution {{to clear up}} this problem is to eliminate the interior rail joints included in railway switches using <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>welding</b> method. In this paper is presented some aspect about the computation of length closure rails {{and the effect of}} weld cooling to ensure a good operating of railway switches after the elimination of interior rail joints...|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} {{hundreds}} aluminothermic welds and tenth of new welds being made daily on the Moroccan rail network. Although the <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>welding</b> technique is well proven, it {{is a critical}} safety component of the rail infrastructure. The consequences of a single failure {{could result in the}} derailment. The observations suggest that these defects are mainly of two types: defects of adhesion (or bonding defects) and porosity defects (or multiple blisters defects). Each of these defects may constitute a privileged site of stress concentration. Depending on the level of these stresses, potential damage process may be developed and put off the rail. It therefore seems necessary to model the mechanical behavior of these welds with these defects in order to classify them by their criticality. In this study, we therefore modeled with the same load and with the same boundary conditions, the weld seam for each type of defect. The numerical and experimental results show that the defects of adhesion tend to concentrate the most constraints...|$|E
40|$|Rail {{transport}} development offers {{economic and}} ecological interests. Nevertheless, it requires heavy investments in rolling material and infrastructure. To be competitive, this transportation means {{must rely on}} safe and reliable infrastructure, which requires optimization of all implemented techniques and structure. Rail thermite (or <b>aluminothermic)</b> <b>welding</b> is widely used within the railway industry for in-track welding during re-rail and defect replacement. The process provides numerous advantages against other welding technology commonly used. Obviously, future demands on train traffic are heavier axle loads, higher train speeds and increased traffic density. Thus, a new enhanced weld should be developed to prevent accidents due to fracture of welds and to lower maintenance costs. In order to improve such assembly process, a detailed metallurgical study coupled to a thermomechanical modelling of the phenomena involved in the thermite welding process is carried out. Obtained data enables us {{to develop a new}} improved thermite weld (type A). This joint is made by modifying the routinely specified procedure (type B) used in a railway rail by a standard gap alumino-thermic weld. Joints of type A and B are tested and compared. Based on experimenta...|$|E
40|$|Straight {{break or}} {{transverse}} fissure {{is one of}} the most common failure modes associated with <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>welds</b> in Australian heavy haul railways. Straight break as a fatigue failure mainly nucleates from stress concentration sites at the weld collar edge and propagates in a near vertical direction under mode I crack opening. The reduction of fatigue performance influenced by the collar features and harsh operational conditions has been investigated using multi-axial fatigue analysis and validated on the basis of in-service failures. Practical observations suggest that a major contributor to the occurrence of many straight breaks is a specific defect known as finning or cold lap. Cold lap is a condition where excess weld material leaks out of the welding mould forming an unfused appendix on the rail surface. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks associated with the cold lap defect through numerical analysis and fracture mechanics. A thermostructural finite element model of a track portion incorporating an <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>weld</b> with a cold lap defect is developed and the cold lap is treated as a planar crack. Sensitivity analysis is performed on cold lap geometric parameters and some operational conditions. The results show that the probability of crack initiation from a cold lap defect largely depends on the lap thickness, lap tip location and the wheel-rail contact conditions. In particular, contact patch eccentricity and lateral tractive forces as a result of curving and hunting behaviour can increase the risk of crack nucleation...|$|R

A statistical study {{has been carried out}} using a large set of measured weld profiles (arbitrary mix of flash butt <b>welds</b> and <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>welds)</b> in order to establish relationships between degradation mechanisms and the longitudinal geometry of the finished weld. The potential benefits which would be expected from improved controls over the welded profile, with respect to not only rail running surface damage but also susceptibility to rail breaks and ballast degradation, are demonstrated. Finally, recommendations for the review of the geometric controls of finished weld geometry in the relevant Euro Norms are made...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequent}} and dangerous failure modes in continuous welded rails is fatigue crack propagation terminated by brittle fracture. Due to the brittleness of the weld material and HAZ and the scatter in its mechanical properties, a statistical approach is necessary. The paper deals with surface cracks at the foot base of <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>welded</b> rails, developing a probabilistic methodology for determining the day by day prospective failure probability. The investigations presented here comprise weld material characterization, simulation of fatigue crack propagation and finally {{the determination of the}} failure probability using the Monte Carlo method. The effect of various parameters, such as axle weight, initial crack size, residual stresses, fatigue crack propagation threshold and date of inspection were analyzed. The results show that, independent of the date of the last inspection, almost any failure event happens in wintertime. This is in accordance with practical experience. However, from the proposed analysis it is evident that the main parameter controlling rail fracture is not only the minimum local temperature, but the temperature range over the whole year. Finally, the results are compared to the standard rail classification method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The {{kingdom of}} Morocco {{has become the}} first African country to adopt a {{high-tech}} rail infrastructure, for the mega (giant) project “Morocco High Speed Train ” (TGVM). Reducing the noise levels of rail traffic is an extremely important issue for the environment and for rolling stock as well. Therefore, research and development in this field in Morocco is very important. The elimination of rail joints is a crucial factor in the reduction of rail noise. The junctions of rails in the railways should be designed {{in a way to}} obtain a great continuity of the raceway. Currently, the rails connections are made by two methods: (1 - Resistance welding) and (2 - <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>welding).</b> The second method is considered the most reliable in Morocco’s railways. For this purpose, this paper aims to present a set of experimental studies of mechanical behaviour, where various samples are recorded from base metal zones and areas of thermite weld. These samples are taken from broken rails that have been used in service. After the benchmarking a microstructural differences have been identified by the optical microscope and the scanning electron microscope between the area of the base metal and the rail thermite weld...|$|E
40|$|A rail is an {{important}} and the most heavily laden element in the railway superstructure, because it functions as both the running surface used for vehicle guidance and the beam directly transmitting the load of the vehicles to the ballast bed and the railway substructure. The {{first part of the}} thesis describes the characteristics of rails and provides a theoretical background relating to rail stresses resulting from traffic load, temperature change and production procedures. When rail vehicles move, enormous contact stresses are produced in the contact zone between the wheel and the rail, which often causes damage to the running surface. Curves with smaller diameters cause particular wear of the rails because of the strongest dynamic effects of the vehicle on the rail. The thesis thus presents the most common surface defects, defines rail wear and outlines currently available techniques of rail grinding and lubrication. In the last few decades, only continuous welded tracks have been consistently installed. To this end, the second chapter describes the procedures and conditions for the construction and welding of rails into continuous welded tracks as provided for in the Rules on railway line superstructure published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 92 / 2010. As for rail welding, special emphasis is given to <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>welding</b> {{which is one of the}} most established procedures for rail welding on the ground...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} improve {{residual}} stress measurement techniques in large components with complex geometries using neutron diffraction. In this work, residual stresses in rail weld samples were measured at locations in welds where {{traditional methods of}} measurement {{are not able to}} access. This {{is the first time that}} full scale rail welds were used for neutron diffraction measurements. The procedure used in these measurements can be used to measure residual stresses more accurately and with higher resolutions in structures with complex and large geometries. Residual stresses in four rail samples were measured at locations where welds are more prone to crack and fracture. Two of the rail welds were made using <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>welding</b> technique, and they had different preheating conditions. Other two samples were made through flash-butt welding technique, and different welding machines were employed to make them. Using the measured residual stresses, the correlation between railway welding techniques, some of the welds' metallurgical characteristics and the measured residual stresses were determined. This work can be used as a stepping stone toward weld optimization procedure in railway industry by minimizing the magnitude of residual stresses, and it adds to understanding of measuring residual stresses in full scale samples, lattice parameter measurements in reference samples and determining the correlation between welding parameters and residual stresses in rail welds. The result obtained through these measurements can be used as a sound base for fatigue analysis and life span prediction of rail welds...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, passanger {{train speed}} and freight train load have {{increased}} to enhance efficiency of rail road transportation. These trends {{have increased the}} severity of rail service conditions, calling for rails with greager wear resistance, strength and fatigue behavior. In the United States and Europe, track site weld rails are made entirely by alumino thermic process. This work describe the results of experimental study conducted on bending fatigue strength of plain rails and alumino thermic welded rails with preheating procedures (oxipropane and air-induced propane) approved by railways authorities. Compliance with the required fatigue strength shall be ascertained by 4 point pulsating bending test in accordance with European standard by alumino thermic weld in rails. The Locati method, based in the empirical Miner's law about the cumulative damage on a fatigue tested material, allows, once known the Wohler curve of the welding process in use to settle the fatigue tensile limit at 50 % with only one test. The values obtained at 2. 10 cycles for plain rails (Sf = 353 MPa), oxipropane preheated <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>weld</b> rails (Sf = 225 MPa), and propane-air induced <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>weld</b> rails (Sf = 210 MPa) {{are very similar to}} those resulting from test method stated in the European Standard. From our point of view and due to its ease, speediness and savings, this is the most suitable test to check the quality and compare the aluminothermic processes in use. En los últimos años la eficiencia de los FECC, tanto para el transporte de viajeros como de mercancías, ha experimentado un desarrollo espectacular. Ello, ha sido posible gracias, entre otros factores, a la fabricación de carriles con resistencia al desgaste, carga de rotura y resistencia a fatiga mejoradas. La soldadura de los carriles, en Europa y U. S. A. se realiza "in situ" por aluminotermia con precalentamiento de los carriles con oxipropano o propano-aire inducido. Los ensayos de fatiga de los carriles soldados se llevan a cabo por flexión en cuatro puntos en concordancia con la norma europea. El método Locati, descrito en esta nota, está basado en la Ley de Miner de daño acumulado y en las curvas de Wohler del material ensayado. Permite calcular, con precisión suficiente, las tensiones límites de fatiga al 50 %. Así, los valores obtenidos, en ensayos a dos millones de ciclos, para carriles sin soldar (Sf = 353 MPa), carriles soldados con precalentamiento de oxipropano (Sf = 225 MPa) y carriles soldados con precalentamiento de propano-aire inducido (Sf = 210 MPa) son muy similares y aceptables a los estipulados por los métodos de determinación del límite de fatiga según norma europea. Debido a la comodidad, rapidez y bajo coste del método Locati resulta, en nuestra opinión, muy adecuado para el control de calidad de los procesos de soldadura aluminotérmica en vigor, de carriles de alta resistencia...|$|R
40|$|Among {{different}} {{rail welding}} methods <b>Aluminothermic</b> <b>welding</b> (ATW) {{is the oldest}} and simplest procedure widely used for re-railing and replacement of defective rails. Since ATW is a cast welding process in which several aspects are operator-dependent it suffers from the variability of the produced weld quality, presence of casting defects and inconsistencies in the microstructure and mechanical properties. Previous observations have shown that field-welded ATWs have been major sources of fatigue and overload failures in Australian heavy haul railway systems. The most common failure modes are categorized into straight breaks (transverse fissure) and horizontal split webs (HSW). Straight breaks initiate from stress concentration sites {{at the edge of}} the weld collar, in the foot, lower web and underhead regions, and propagate in vertical direction under Mode I loading. HSW failures involve the development of a horizontal fatigue crack which initiates from a surface or near-surface gross defect in the weld collar, generally in the mid- or upper-web region. In this study analysis of fatigue crack initiation is performed {{at the edge of the}} weld collar of an aluminothermic weld, in order to examine the formation of straight break under high axle load conditions. The fatigue assessment is accomplished using a thermo-structural finite element simulation in ANSYS package followed by a shear based multi-axial fatigue critical plane criterion implemented in a MATLAB computer code. The influence of several parameters including wheel-rail contact patch eccentricity, contact tractions, residual stress distribution, seasonal temperature variation and track support condition is investigated. The analysis identifies the underhead region of a defect-free weld as the most critical location which is subject to severe fatigue damage under harsh curving and hunting behaviours...|$|E
40|$|Aluminothermic {{rail welding}} {{is widely used}} as an in track welding process due to its low cost, fast {{installation}} and equipment portability. Despite operational preferences, <b>aluminothermic</b> <b>welding</b> suffers from variations of the produced weld quality and defects which {{are the result of}} its cast-like process. As a consequence the probability of aluminothermic service failures may be higher than the parent rail, particularly under high axle load conditions. This paper addresses the risk of weld failure though the development of an analytical approach to assessing the fatigue behaviour of aluminothermic welds, and {{the development and implementation of}} an enhanced welder training and competency program which has contributed to a significant decrease in defective welds. The bending behavior of aluminothermic weld is investigated around two most important failure modes for heavy haul operation: horizontal split web (HSW) and straight break. Due to the cyclic nature of the applied loads, these failure modes are overseen in the context of fatigue crack analysis which involves fatigue crack initiation and propagation assessments. However, it is believed that the material distress as a result of wheel-rail contact stress, bending, weld residual and seasonal thermal stresses as well as weld geometry would highly affect the failure initiation sites and the life to crack initiation of the weld. In order to investigate the weld material distress, a thermo-structural finite element model of the rail weld has been developed incorporating the track stiffness behavior to enable us superpose the seasonal thermal effects with local bending and contact stresses. The effect of some heavy haul parameters such as contact patch lateral movement due to curving or hunting with various traction coefficients are also investigated. The simulation results show a good consistency between the bending behavior of the weld and fatigue crack initiation probability based on observations. The current study forms the basis for a comprehensive fatigue crack initiation analysis as the next stage of the project...|$|E
