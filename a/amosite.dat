50|$|Asbestos is a {{naturally}} occurring group of silicate minerals that can readily be separated into thin strong fibres that are flexible, heat resistant and chemically inert. Within the United Kingdom {{and elsewhere in}} the world, asbestos was used extensively as a building material from the 1950s to the 1980s. It was used as a means of fireproofing as well as insulation and any building built before 2000 could contain asbestos. Although Asbestos can be safe if the material is kept in good condition and undisturbed, if damaged asbestos fibres could become airborne and cause serious risks to health if inhaled. Serious diseases including mesothelioma, lung cancer, and asbestosis could result if someone were to breathe in high levels of asbestos fibres. A particular risk if someone were to be working either on, or with, asbestos materials which had been damaged. There are six forms of Asbestos although only three are commonly used, these are Chrysotile (white asbestos), the most common; <b>Amosite</b> (brown asbestos) which can often be found in ceiling tiles and as a fire retardant in thermal insulation products; Crocidolite (blue asbestos), commonly used in high temperature applications.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} chronic {{inhalation}} of glass fibers and <b>amosite</b> asbestos are currently under study in hamsters. The study includes 18 months of inhalation exposure followed by lifetime recovery. Syrian golden hamsters are exposed, nose only, for 6 hr/day, 5 day/week to size-selected test fibers: MMVF 10 a (Schuller 901 insulation glass); MMVF 33 (Schuller 475 durable glass); <b>amosite</b> asbestos (three doses); or to filtered air (controls). Here we report interim results on airborne fiber characterization, lung fiber burden, and pathology (preliminary) through 12 months. Aerosolized test fibers averaged 15 to 20 microns {{in length and}} 0. 5 to 1 micron in diameter. Target aerosol concentrations of World Health Organization (WHO) fibers (longer than 5 microns) were 250 fibers/cc for MMVF 10 a and MMVF 33, and 25, 125, or 250 fibers/cc for <b>amosite.</b> WHO fiber lung burdens showed time-dependent and (for <b>amosite)</b> dose-dependent increases. After a 12 -month exposure, lung burdens of fibers longer than 20 microns were greatest with <b>amosite</b> high and mid doses, similar for low-dose <b>amosite</b> and MMVF 33, and smaller for MMVF 10 a. Biological responses of animals exposed for 12 months to MMVF 10 a were limited to nonspecific pulmonary inflammation. However, exposures to MMVF 33 and each of three doses of <b>amosite</b> were associated with lung fibrosis and possible mesotheliomas (1 with MMVF 33 and 2, 3, and 1 with <b>amosite</b> low, mid, and high doses, respectively). Pulmonary and pleural changes associated with <b>amosite</b> were qualitatively and quantitatively more severe than those associated with MMVF 33. As of the 12 -month time point, this study demonstrates that two different fiber glass compositions with similar fiber dimensions but different durabilities can have distinctly different effects on the hamster lung and pleura after inhalation exposure. (Preliminary tumor data through 18 months of exposure and 6 weeks of postexposure recovery became available as this manuscript went to press: No tumors were observed in the control or MMVF 10 a groups, and no additional tumors were observed in the MMVF 33 group; however, a number of additional mesotheliomas were observed in the <b>amosite</b> groups...|$|E
