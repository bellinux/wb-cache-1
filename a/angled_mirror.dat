The sleeping berths for the crew were fitted at {{the floor of the}} basket, along with some of stores and provisions. The highly flammable hydrogen meant that cooking could not be done in the basket itself. The solution was a modified primus stove (designed by a friend of Andrée's) that could be dangled 8m (26ft) below the crew and then lit from the basket, at a safe distance. An <b>angled</b> <b>mirror</b> attached to the specially designed stove allowed the crew to determine whether it was successfully lit or not.|$|E

25|$|The {{physical}} exam includes a systematic {{examination of the}} whole patient to assess general health and to look for signs of associated conditions and metastatic disease. The neck and supraclavicular fossa are palpated to feel for cervical adenopathy, other masses, and laryngeal crepitus. The oral cavity and oropharynx are examined under direct vision. The larynx may be examined by indirect laryngoscopy using a small <b>angled</b> <b>mirror</b> with a long handle (akin to a dentist's mirror) and a strong light. Indirect laryngoscopy can be highly effective, but requires skill and practice for consistent results. For this reason, many specialist clinics now use fibre-optic nasal endoscopy where a thin and flexible endoscope, inserted through the nostril, is used to clearly visualise the entire pharynx and larynx. Nasal endoscopy is a quick and easy procedure performed in clinic. Local anaesthetic spray may be used.|$|E

Film noir is also known for its use of odd angles, such as Roger's low shot introduction in the first episode.

Other disorientating devices like dutch <b>angles,</b> <b>mirror</b> reflection and distorting shots are employed throughout the series.|$|R

50|$|A zograscope is {{an optical}} device for {{enhancing}} {{the sense of}} depth perception from a flat picture. It consists of a large magnifying lens through which the picture is viewed.

Pictures viewed in this way need to be left-right reversed; this is obvious in the case of writing. A print made for this purpose is called a vue d'optique or perspective view.|$|E

Its television sports style of display was later adopted by 3D sports games and is now used by virtually all major team sports titles. In 1984, Sega ported several pseudo-3D arcade games to the Sega SG-1000 console, including a smooth conversion of the third-person pseudo-3D rail shooter Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom.|$|R

40|$|Deviations {{from the}} ideal shape of {{reflector}} panels for parabolic trough {{solar power plants}} can have relevant impact on field efficiency and thus {{on the performance of}} the whole power plant. Analyzing the gravity-induced deformation of mirror shape for different <b>mirror</b> <b>angles</b> is relevant for performance calculation of solar parabolic trough collectors and identifying optimization potential of the mirror panels. Two mirror model cases (stiff and elastic supports) are evaluated in four angles: in horizontal laboratory <b>angle</b> (<b>mirrors</b> facing upward with mounting points horizontally aligned), and in 0 deg, 45 deg, and 90 deg collector angle. The resulting slope maps are calculated in a separate postprocessing. In order to evaluate the effect of gravity load on mirror shape, the deformed mirror in each evaluated angle is compared to the nondeformed mirror shape, and to the shapes in 0 deg (zenith) collector angle, respectively. The resulting slope deviation maps show the mirror deformation in different <b>mirror</b> <b>angles.</b> Stiffness of the mounting to the support structure has a relevant impact. Mirror deformation on elastic brackets (SDx up to 1. 6 mrad) is much more pronounced than on an ideal stiff support structure (SDx up to 1. 0 mrad) ...|$|R
50|$|When stereo {{images are}} to be {{presented}} to a single user, it is practical to construct an image combiner, using partially silvered mirrors and two image screens {{at right angles to}} one another. One image is seen directly through the <b>angled</b> <b>mirror</b> whilst the other is seen as a reflection. Polarized filters are attached to the image screens and appropriately angled filters are worn as glasses. A similar technique uses a single screen with an inverted upper image, viewed in a horizontal partial reflector, with an upright image presented below the reflector, again with appropriate polarizers.|$|E
5000|$|As arcade {{technology}} {{entered the}} 1990s, larger cabinets were being built {{which in turn}} also housed larger monitors such as the 3 28" [...] screen version of Namco's Ridge Racer from 1993.

5000|$|Also {{known as}} a [...] "tubular skylight" [...] or [...] "tubular {{daylighting}} device", this is {{the oldest and most}} widespread type of light tube used for daylighting.

Chappuis Ltd's reflectors were in continuous production until the factory was destroyed in 1943. The concept was rediscovered and patented in 1986 by Solatube International of Australia. This system has been marketed for widespread residential and commercial use.

5000|$|The image {{passes through}} a lens into a beam {{splitter}} that sends half the light to a 35 mm or 16 mm camera mounted {{on the right side}} of the television camera.

Because the camera dollies had to support two cameras—one conventional electronic [...] "image orthicon" [...] TV camera tube, and one 35mm motion picture camera—the system was bulky and heavy, and somewhat clumsy in operation. This made complex productions problematic. Single-stage shows, such as The Honeymooners, were relatively easy since they had few sets and generally small casts.|$|R

50|$|The {{conductive}} AFM tip {{was easily}} aligned over the reflected illumination beam. The laser {{spot in the}} sample {{was reported to be}} 1mm in size and can be found using the AFM recording device. A convenience of this technique is that laser alignment is only necessary for imaging in the z-direction because the photocurrents are mapped in this direction. Therefore, normal AFM/c-AFM can be implemented for analysis in the x and y directions.The instrumental module proposed by Lee et al. produced spot sizes from the illumination laser of 1 mm in thicknesses. Recent applications have altered Lee’s design in order to decrease spot size while simultaneously increasing the intensity of this laser. Recent instrumentation has replaced the <b>angled</b> <b>mirror</b> with an inverted microscope and a neutral density filter. In this device the x and y piezos, illumination laser and inverted microscopy are confined underneath the sample substrate, while the z-piezo remains above the conductive cantilever. In the applications of Ginger et al. a neutral-density filter is added to increase laser attenuation and the precision of laser alignment is enhanced by the addition of the inverted microscope.|$|E

One of the major challenges the production crew faced was disguising the wheels {{to create the illusion}} that the craft was hovering.

A small blur could be seen under the speeder, which George Lucas called [...] "The Force Spot" [...] (stated in Special Edition Tape). Production designer Roger Christian used an <b>angled</b> <b>mirror</b> and a broom attached to the vehicle's underside to create, at certain angles, the illusion that the craft was hovering and kicking up dust.
