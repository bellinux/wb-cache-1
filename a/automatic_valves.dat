2500|$|The {{exhaust valve}} lets the diver vent {{expanding}} {{gas from the}} suit during the ascent. On ascent {{the air in the}} suit expands making buoyancy control difficult or impossible. [...] This may cause an uncontrolled ascent resulting in missed decompression stops, decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism or pulmonary barotrauma. The manual exhaust allows the diver to control the suit volume; this may incorporate an automatic, adjustable exhaust or there may be a separate automatic, auto dump, valve on the shoulder. [...] <b>Automatic</b> <b>valves</b> can be set to release at a pre-set pressure and in most situations, the diver can leave the automatic valve at a constant setting throughout the dive so that it releases {{with a small amount of}} over-pressure venting as needed automatically as the diver ascends. There are many different configurations but automatic vents are generally at the left shoulder, and manual vents are at the wrist. Environmentally sealed suits used for diving in contaminated water have no dump valve, but are clamped to the helmet with a watertight seal, so the exhaust valve of the helmet functions as a dump valve. Some, now rare, older dry suits may have no vents, requiring the diver to lift one of the wrist seals or the neck seal open to vent the suit.|$|E
50|$|In two-pipe steam systems, {{there is}} a return path for the {{condensate}} and it may involve pumps as well as gravity-induced flow. The flow of steam to individual radiators can be modulated using manual or <b>automatic</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|E
40|$|Most furrow {{irrigation}} systems have low performance due to deep percolation at the upstream end and tailwater runoff at {{the downstream end}} of the field. To eliminate this problem improving {{furrow irrigation}} performance is necessary. Since the inflow discharge has high effect on infiltration along the furrow which consequently affects the application efficiency and water distribution uniformity, {{it would be important}} to apply different furrow inflow hydrograph shapes based on the field data such as field slope, soil texture and furrow length to save water. To produce different furrow inflow hydrograph shapes, an <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> which was connected to a stepper motor was designed to change the inflow discharge with time according to the desired inflow hydrograph shape. The experimental field was located at Isfahan University of Technology. A constant head water delivery system to the furrows including the <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> was installed in the experimental field and the tests were conducted for different inflow hydrograph shapes. The comparison of the measured furrow inflow discharges with the simulated furrow inflow discharges produced by the <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> showed that the <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> can produce different furrow inflow hydrograph shapes with high accuracy...|$|R
50|$|Behind the {{pressure}} vessel, {{there is a}} pressure control valve which is controlled by an iron weight suspended from a gear rack thus making up an adjustable <b>automatic</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Control valves {{can also}} work with {{hydraulic}} actuators ({{also known as}} hydraulic pilots). These types of valves are also known as <b>Automatic</b> Control <b>Valves.</b> The hydraulic actuators will respond to changes of pressure or flow and will open/close the <b>valve.</b> <b>Automatic</b> Control <b>Valves</b> do not require an external power source, meaning that the fluid pressure is enough to open and close the valve.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1930s, {{helped by}} high customs {{barriers}} and import bans on certain products, Clausen {{was successful in}} producing and selling {{a long list of}} <b>automatic</b> <b>valves</b> for refrigeration plants, which had previously been imported from the United States.|$|E
50|$|Watt {{never ceased}} {{improving}} his designs. This further improved the operating cycle speed, introduced governors, <b>automatic</b> <b>valves,</b> double-acting pistons, {{a variety of}} rotary power takeoffs and many other improvements. Watt's technology enabled the widespread commercial use of stationary steam engines.|$|E
50|$|Multiple turbomolecular pumps {{in a lab}} or manufacturing-plant can be {{connected}} by tubes to a small backing pump. <b>Automatic</b> <b>valves</b> and diffusion pump like injection into a large buffer-tube {{in front of the}} backing pump prevents any overpressure from one pump to stall another pump.|$|E
50|$|Hydronic {{systems are}} usually {{connected}} to a water supply (such as the public water supply). An <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> regulates {{the amount of water}} in the system and also prevents backflow of system water (and any water treatment chemicals) into the water supply.|$|R
40|$|A PC-based pre-programmed {{controller}} {{was developed}} for a supersonic blowdown wind tunnel with short run time. It starts the tunnel very quickly without any overshoot of the stagnation pressure. The controller system consists of a pressure transducer, a multifunction PC board and an <b>automatic</b> <b>valve.</b> An ideal valve opening profile for a particular test is developed based on preceding test results at the exact same test condi-tions of throat area of a nozzle and storage tank pressure. The profile is stored in the system memory before a test and the multifunction board sends an analog output to the <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> during a test. After several tests and corrective interpolations, the pressure disturbances in the plenum chamber are typically reduced to {{one percent of the}} stagnation pressure...|$|R

50|$|In 1933, Mads Clausen, an {{engineer}} specializing in {{air conditioning and}} refrigeration, established the Danish Cooling Automatic and Appliance Factory in his boyhood attic room in Elsmark, on the Danish island of Als. He started producing <b>automatic</b> <b>valves</b> for refrigeration plants, which previously had to be imported from the United States.|$|E
50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>valves</b> {{are used}} to release trapped air as it collects. They are not a {{substitute}} for bleeding a system manually when it is first filled during commissioning, nor for remedial bleeding if the system becomes choked with trapped air. In those cases, individual bleed screws on each radiator, or high pipe run, are opened manually.|$|E

5000|$|Two main {{theories}} have been postulated {{as to how}} gas could have leaked. Dr. Eckener believed a snapped bracing wire had torn a gas cell open (see below), while others suggest that a maneuvering or <b>automatic</b> gas <b>valve</b> was stuck open and gas from cell 4 leaked through. During the airship's first flight to Rio, a gas cell was nearly emptied when an <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> was stuck open, and gas had to be transferred from other cells to maintain an even keel. However, no other valve failures were reported during the ship's flight history, and on the final approach {{there was no indication}} in instruments that a valve had stuck open.|$|R
50|$|The proper {{construction}} of this claim {{was that it}} covered an <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> in combination with a contrivance consisting of a pinhole and pin, by which the valve may be raised from its seat, so as to leave the valve hole permanently open, or by which the valve may be rigidly closed upon its seat, making a closed or plug valve.|$|R

50|$|During the {{suction stroke}} of the {{delivery}} piston the medium is sucked in via the open suction ball valve. At {{the same time}} the ball valve on the delivery line is pushed into the valve seating by the underpressure resulting from the suction (<b>automatic</b> <b>valves).</b> In parallel with this, the second delivery piston is making the pressure stroke and forces the medium through the discharge ball valve and into the delivery line. The suction ball valve is pushed into its seating by the delivery line pressure and thereby closes off the connection to pump intake.|$|E
50|$|Thor was an American {{manufacturer}} of motorcycles and motorcycle parts especially engines, founded in 1901 in Aurora, Illinois. From 1901 to about 1907 it made engines under license for Indian motorcycles of Connecticut, which Thor was also allowed to sell {{on the open}} market. Thor also sold a large variety of parts and when the agreement finally ended, entered the motorcycle market on its own selling complete bikes until about 1920. Some of its success were supplying engines to many motorcycle manufactures of the period, some record setting bikes in the early 1910s, and V-Twin engine with <b>automatic</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|E

50|$|Small <b>automatic</b> <b>valves</b> are {{available}} to fit individual radiators. As these need to operate in any orientation, they use a different mechanism rather than a float. The Aladdin HVC30 system uses a 'hygroseal' cartridge. This is a small disc of material that expands when wet and shrinks if warm and dry. A dry valve acts as an air vent until a dribble of water passes through it and swells the cartridge. If the valve dries out again, it re-opens. A characteristic of these valves is that they function best on the hot delivery side of a radiator and may not open as vents unless the water supply is hot.|$|E
50|$|Another {{factor is}} the {{decision}} to let the airship rise above the cloud layer, causing heating and then expansion of the hydrogen, which triggered automatic valving of the gas. Once the engines were restarted, the ship dived through the cloud into freezing air again and, either because the <b>automatic</b> <b>valves</b> were jammed open, or because the ship had already lost too much gas above the clouds, it could no longer stay aloft. Although Umberto Nobile {{was the victim of}} a smear campaign after the crash, one criticism of him, from the master airship pilot Hugo Eckener is perhaps justified — that Nobile should never have climbed above the cloud layer in the first place.|$|E
50|$|Snorkels created several {{problems}} for their users. A U-boat with a snorkel raised {{was limited to}} six knots to avoid breaking the tube, and its sound-detection gear was useless with the diesel engine running. Most dramatically, snorkels were equipped with <b>automatic</b> <b>valves</b> to prevent seawater from being sucked into the diesels, but when these valves slammed shut the engines would draw air from the boat itself before shutting down, causing a partial vacuum which was extremely painful to the ears of the crew and sometimes even ruptured eardrums. This problem still exists in later model diesel (and even modern nuclear) submarines, but is mitigated by high-vacuum cut-off sensors that shut down the engines when the vacuum in the ship reaches a pre-set point.|$|E

5000|$|Soon {{after the}} new company was formed in 1898, the firm moved its {{manufacturing}} from Tours to Paris, into its new factory (a former hydraulic machinery plant that Morane and his brother-in-law Leon Desmarais had inherited from Morane's father). Charles Weiffenbach was named Operations Manager. Delahaye would produce three models there, until {{the close of the}} 19th century: two twins, the 2.2-litre [...] Type 1 and [...] Type 2, and the lighter Type 0 (which proved capable of up to 22 mph), with a 1.4-liter single rated between [...] All three had bicycle-style steering, water-cooled engines mounted in the rear, <b>automatic</b> <b>valves,</b> surface carburetors, and trembler coil ignition; drive was a combination of belt and chain, with three forward speeds and one reverse.|$|E
5000|$|The engine {{developed}} for the Grose Monoplane was also tested in Norway in 1909 as a snow-sled engine by Antarctic explorer Captain Robert Scott. [...] The engine was changed to an in-line four-cylinder [...] unit with mechanical inlet valves, rather than their usual <b>automatic</b> <b>valves.</b> It used a Brown & Barlow carburettor and had a Bosch magneto ignition. The motorised sledge engine was designed to run for 300 mi carrying {{three quarters of a}} ton at a top speed of just 3 mph. In the coverage of Scott's departure on 1 June 1910 The New York Times quoted him as saying they would take the motorised sledges as far as they could and hoped they would [...] "relieve the ponies and dogs of weight and increase the safety of the return journey".|$|E
5000|$|While {{a simple}} siphon cannot output liquid {{at a level}} higher than the source reservoir, a more {{complicated}} device utilizing an airtight metering chamber at the crest and a system of <b>automatic</b> <b>valves,</b> may discharge liquid on an ongoing basis, at a level higher than the source reservoir, without outside pumping energy being added. It can accomplish this despite what initially {{appears to be a}} violation of conservation of energy because it {{can take advantage of the}} energy of a large volume of liquid dropping some distance, to raise and discharge a small volume of liquid above the source reservoir. Thus it might be said to [...] "require" [...] a large quantity of falling liquid to power the dispensing of a small quantity. Such a system typically operates in a cyclical or start/stop but ongoing and self-powered manner. Ram pumps do not work in this way. These metering pumps are true siphon pumping devices which use siphons as their power source.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{this state}} of facts, it was plain that the mere {{employment}} by the defendants {{of the old and}} well known <b>automatic</b> safety <b>valve</b> afforded no ground upon which to base the relief prayed for in the appellant's bill. Appellant's counsel therefore disclaimed any right to the exclusive use of an <b>automatic</b> safety <b>valve,</b> and said: [...] "We do not claim the valve any further than in this combination with a steam fire engine." ...|$|R
