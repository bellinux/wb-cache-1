5|$|The {{staff at}} Cherry Springs State Park {{did not intend}} for it to become an {{attraction}} for amateur astronomers; the astronomers came to them instead. In 1997or 1998Chip Harrison, the park supervisor, noticed a man looking through a telescope at the park at about 1AM. When Harrison <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> man had come there, the astronomer said he had noticed an isolated black patch over north central Pennsylvania on nighttime satellite photos. Cherry Springs State Park is in that patch, {{one of the best}} locations east of the Mississippi River for stargazing.|$|E
5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, the {{statement}} {{was the result of}} an intense argument in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said {{the statement}} represented the truth as they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> IPCC were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} livery {{variants}} were tested on scale models, which were later exposed at VR's conference centre at Helsinki central railway station: {{one has a}} red strip for the whole length of the train, with the window backgrounds painted grey. The other is more similar to the final result, but {{the front of the}} train includes more red and no grey paint at all. VR finally settled to a combination of both of them, which bore resemblance to the company's InterCity livery. The bottom of the carriages is dark grey, with a red stripe distinguishing it from the white base colour. The top of the carriages is painted grey. Red colouring {{at the end of each}} car forms red parallelograms when the carriages are combined. When <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> trains were not blue and white, VR's CEO answered that red and white fits the train and its design the best.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} folk {{tales of the}} Tylwyth Teg, the fairy people who {{inhabited}} the area and an invisible land in Cardigan Bay. One tells of a farmer from Aberdaron {{who was in the}} habit of stepping outside his house before retiring to bed. One night he was spoken to by a stranger, who <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> farmer was annoyed by him. The farmer, confused, asked what the stranger meant and was told to stand with one foot on the stranger's. This he did, and could see another house, just below his own, and that all the farm's slops went down the chimney of the invisible house. The stranger asked if the farmer would move his door {{to the other side of}} the house, which the farmer subsequently did, walling up the original door; from that day, the farmer's livestock flourished, and he became one of the most prosperous men in the area.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{entered the}} Lutheran Fasori Evangelikus Gimnázium in 1911. This {{was one of}} the best schools in Budapest, part of a {{brilliant}} education system designed for the elite. Under the Hungarian system, children received all their education at the one gymnasium. Despite being run by the Lutheran Church, the majority of its pupils were Jewish. The school system produced a generation noted for intellectual achievement, that included Theodore von Kármán (b. 1881), George de Hevesy (b. 1885), Leó Szilárd (b. 1898), Dennis Gabor (b. 1900), Eugene Wigner (b. 1902), Edward Teller (b. 1908), and Paul Erdős (b. 1913). Collectively, they were sometimes known as Martians. Wigner was a year ahead of von Neumann at the Lutheran School. When <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Hungary of his generation had produced so many geniuses, Wigner, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, replied that von Neumann was the only genius.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{dismissed}} Smith's argument, {{asserting that}} neither the Federation nor Rhodesia had ever made such an appointment (this was actually false; the Federal government had opened independent diplomatic missions in South Africa and Portuguese Mozambique, and Rhodesia retained them both). Johnston concluded that Rhodesia was trying to prematurely advance its international standing. The previous entrustments, he said, {{had been made to}} allow Britain and Rhodesia to cooperate subject to Whitehall's ultimate authority, and did not entitle Rhodesia to do as it liked in the field of external affairs, especially if its chosen line ran counter to Britain's. In an attempt to intimidate Smith, Johnston sternly <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Rhodesian Prime Minister would risk causing a major international incident by deliberately defying Britain; Smith replied that following Britain's several slights against Rhodesia over the previous year and a half, Salisbury would not accept another. The conversation continued in this manner for some time afterwards. Smith proposed that the relevant documents be examined jointly by two judges, one British and one Rhodesian, but Johnston refused this. The meeting ended without agreement.|$|E

5|$|On 3October Speedy, while sailing {{once again}} off Gibraltar, spotted ten small ships {{coming out of}} Algeciras, gunboats {{apparently}} attempting to attack a British convoy that was then passing. Brenton identified the ships as merchantmen, attempting to evade the British at Gibraltar in the bad weather. On Speedys approach, they scattered, four sheltering under a fort. Speedy approached and fired on them, causing their crews to abandon their ships. They were driven ashore by the wind, and despite sending boats out, {{it was impossible to}} get them off, so they were left to be reduced to wrecks. Three days later, Speedy was standing off Europa Point when twelve gunboats were sighted coming out of Algeciras to attack two merchant ships making their way past Gibraltar. One, the Unity, was carrying wine and spirits for the fleet. Their combined firepower far outweighed that of Speedy, but Brenton turned his ship towards them, covering the escape of one of the merchantmen with his fire. The gunboats were attempting to catch the Unity when Brenton took his ship through the flotilla, close enough to break many of their oars, maintaining a constant fire from his guns and with every spare member of the crew firing muskets. The Spanish flotilla broke and fled. Speedy suffered two men killed and one wounded, and sustained considerable damage to her rigging and below her waterline. She was unable to return to Gibraltar in the rising wind, and was forced to run along the coast to Tétouan Bay, where her shot-holes were plugged to allow her to make her way back. During the engagement with the gunboats, the guns in the fortress of Gibraltar had not fired in support of Speedy. When Brenton <b>asked</b> <b>why,</b> <b>the</b> Governor of Gibraltar, General Charles O'Hara, replied that he had arranged with the Governor of Algeciras for the guns never to be fired at the gunboats so as not to annoy the inhabitants of the town.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the attack, {{questions}} were asked in Parliament by Manny Shinwell about the lack of use of the guns carried on Domala in her defence. Winston Churchill replied that the aircraft that attacked Domala had been initially misidentified as a friendly one, which was why the guns were not manned. A British destroyer also misidentified the aircraft. It was also <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> gunners were not always manning the guns. In India, there was public anger towards Germany as {{a result of}} the attack. Eighty-one of those killed were Indian citizens.|$|E
25|$|Minns {{also had}} {{previously}} {{asserted that the}} behavior of two IRS attorneys at law, Kenneth McWade and William A. Sims, constituted legal misconduct and recommended them for disbarment. Following an investigation, the law licenses of the IRS attorneys were duly suspended for a two-year period after a federal court ruling found that the two had indeed defrauded the courts in connection with 1,300 tax shelter cases. In 2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that the IRS lawyers had corruptly agreed with certain taxpayers that no tax collection actions would be taken against them—in return for testimony against other taxpayers. The court also <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> IRS had not punished the two.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{learning}} from fellow tenants of 23 Cranley Gardens that the tenant {{of the top}} floor flat from where the human remains had been flushed was Dennis Andrew Nilsen, and that he worked in a job centre in Kentish Town, Detective Chief Inspector Peter Jay and two colleagues opted to wait outside 23 Cranley Gardens until Nilsen returned home from work. When Nilsen returned home, DCI Jay introduced himself and his colleagues; explaining {{they had come to}} enquire about the blockage in the drains from his flat. Nilsen <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> police would be interested in his drains and also if the two officers present with Jay were health inspectors.

25|$|Juan Jimenez, {{software}} {{manager for}} Sony Spain, told Spanish gaming site The Vault that Uncharted 3 would {{make use of}} the PlayStation Network Pass, making it the second game to carry the feature following Resistance 3. As is standard, a one-time code will be provided with copies of Uncharted 3 for first time buyers giving them immediate access to online multiplayer features, whereas second-hand purchasers of the title will have to pay extra for online play. When <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> developers implemented the pass system, game director Justin Richmond replied, that without the money from Sony's PSN Pass it wouldn't be able to afford to include as much online content as it has with Uncharted 3, and would possibly have to separate the online and offline content into separate products.|$|E
25|$|When Fleury died in January 1743 {{at the age}} of 90, Louis XV {{took control}} of government. While Britain and France were not yet {{formally}} at war, they were funding different sides in the War of the Austrian Succession and open hostilities seemed imminent. This meant Louis was more open to Jacobite requests and in August sent James Butler, his Master of Horse to England to assess their prospects. Butler was provided lists of supporters, including one claiming 190 of the 236 members of the powerful trade body the Corporation of London as 'Jacobite.' When Louis <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> English needed help if support was so widespread, his advisors attributed it to dislike of foreigners and government repression. In reality {{it was a combination of}} wishful thinking and confusing indifference to the Hanoverians with enthusiasm for the Jacobites.|$|E
