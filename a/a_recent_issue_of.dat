40|$|<b>A</b> {{number of}} <b>recent</b> publications, {{including}} <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> special <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> World Archaeology, have engaged with museum collections as assemblages {{that can be}} studied in their own right. This paper attempts to refigure ‘collection’ and ‘assemblage’ as action nouns, in order to explore the role these processes can have in generating understandings of the past, especially within museum settings. While nineteenth-century projects involving collecting and assemblage contributed fundamental disciplinary frameworks to archaeology, museums have increasingly been regarded as institutions exclusively focused on the archival storage of excavated material, and the display of archaeological knowledge generated through fieldwork. This paper makes the case that a creative and reflective reengagement with collection, {{as a process of}} assemblage and reassemblage, including in forms made possible by electronic media, has the potential to refresh museum archaeology for the twentyfirst century, realigning it with other archaeological practices...|$|R
40|$|<b>A</b> <b>recent</b> special <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> AI Magazine (AAAI 2005) was {{dedicated}} {{to the topic of}} semantic integration — the problem of sharing data across disparate sources. At the core of the solution lies the discovery the “se-mantics ” of different data sources. Ideally, the se-mantics of data are captured by a formal ontology of the domain together with a semantic mapping connect-ing the schema describing the data to the ontology. However, establishing the semantic mapping from a database schema to a formal ontology in terms of for-mal logic expressions is inherently difficult to automate, so the task was left to humans. In this paper, we re-port on our study (An, Borgida, & Mylopoulos 2005 a; 2005 b) of a semi-automatic tool, called MAPONTO, that assists users to discover plausible semantic relation-ships between a database schema (relational or XML) and an ontology, expressing them as logical formu-las/rules...|$|R
