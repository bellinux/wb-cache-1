He rode the Tour de Suisse and won the opening time trial, along with the final stage that was <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> trial. With the opening stage victory in the Tour de Suisse, Cancellara led the race for a few stages before losing it to {{teammate}} Fränk Schleck after stage four. Cancellara continued his success in the time trial with {{a victory in the}} Swiss national time trial.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{holding a}} {{monopoly}} on cases in the Court of Common Pleas, Serjeants also took most of the business in the Court of King's Bench. Although required to make the Common Pleas their principal place of work, {{there is evidence of}} Serjeants who did not; one, Robert Mennell, worked entirely in the North of England after his creation in 1547 and was not known in Westminster, where the Common Pleas was located. This was <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of great judicial success for the Serjeants; since only Serjeants could be appointed to the common law courts, many also sat in the Exchequer of Pleas, a court of equity. This period was not a time of success for the profession overall, however, despite the brisk business being done. The rise of central courts other than the Common Pleas allowed other lawyers to gain advocacy experience and work, drawing it away from the Serjeants, {{and at the same time}} the few Serjeants could not handle all the business in the Common Pleas, allowing the rise of barristers as dedicated advocates.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{outbreak}} of the First Muslim Civil War and the priorities on other fronts, the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century. The Khazars, on their part, only launched a few raids into the Transcaucasian principalities that were loosely under Muslim dominion: in 661/662, they launched a raid into Albania but were defeated by the local prince; in 683 or 685 (<b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of civil war in the Muslim world), a large-scale raid across Transcaucasia was more successful, capturing much booty and many prisoners.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil War, Indianapolis {{served as}} a {{gathering}} place for organizing troops. As Indianapolis's citizens rallied {{in support of the}} Union, its population increased with the arrival of new businesses and industries that offered additional employment opportunities and spurred real estate development. City residents experienced rising prices and wartime hardships, such as food and clothing shortages. It was <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of bitter political disputes between Indiana's Democrats and Republicans. The Civil War era ushered {{in the beginning of the}} city's urban, industrial development, its connections to an expanding railroad network, and the growth of local charitable organizations.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the city's {{population}} {{increased with}} the arrival of new businesses and industries that offered additional employment opportunities, spurred real estate development, and ushered {{in the beginning of the}} city's urban, industrial development. In addition, street crime was prevalent, causing the city government to increase its police force and local merchants to hire private security. The era was <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of bitter political disputes between Indiana's Democrats and Republicans. In May 1863, in an incident sarcastically called the Battle of Pogue's Run, Union soldiers stopped and searched two departing trainloads of delegates to a statewide Democratic convention, many of whom tossed their personal weapons into a nearby creek. In July 1863 Indianapolis residents feared an attack from Confederate forces during Morgan's Raid into southern Indiana, but the Confederates turned east toward Ohio and never came to the city.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of change in the British attitude to race relations. Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and {{it is not clear whether}} he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} of the 1930s brought mass unemployment to Sunderland. But, for the Echo, it was <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of important structural changes in ownership. A new company controlling the three titles owned by the Storey family was formed in 1934—Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers Ltd. There was a change in name for the Echo too, when the word Daily was dropped from its title of Sunderland Daily Echo and Shipping Gazette. The decade also, however, brought a fire which destroyed most of the bound files of archive copies of the Echo. Nineteenth-century editions of the Echo can only be accessed in Sunderland at the City Centre Library in Fawcett Street.|$|E

25|$|The sixth cholera {{pandemic}} {{had little}} effect in western Europe because of advances in public health, but major Russian cities and the Ottoman Empire were particularly hard hit by cholera deaths. More than 500,000 people died of cholera in Russia from 1900 to 1925, which was <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of social disruption because of revolution and warfare.|$|E
25|$|As {{had also}} been true of the 1900–1920 period, the Roaring Twenties were a {{favorable}} time for consolidation and even conglomeration throughout the business world. It was <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of strongly continuing mechanization on North American farms. At Allis-Chalmers, the 1920s brought yet more tractors, such as the 18-30, the 12-20, the 15-25, and the United tractor/Model U.|$|E

25|$|The Harlem Renaissance was <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of {{increased}} political involvement for African Americans.

25|$|Many of {{the best}} known Classical Chinese poems, popular also in translation, are from the Song dynasty poets, such as Su Shi (Dongpo), Ouyang Xiu, Lu You and Yang Wanli.

25|$|The {{culture of}} Myanmar is deemed synonymous with its Buddhism. There are many Burmese festivals {{all through the}} year, most of them related to Buddhism.

25|$|The 18th and 19th centuries were {{a time of}} {{expansion}} and colonisation by Western Europeans. It was <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of much Christian revival and in England, a considerable growth in the Roman Catholic Church. There was also much industrialisation {{and the growth of}} towns. New churches and cathedrals were needed. The Medieval styles, and particularly Gothic, were seen as the most suitable for the building of new cathedrals, both in Europe and in the colonies.|$|E
25|$|Despite these crises, the 14th {{century was}} <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of great {{progress}} {{in the arts and}} sciences. Following a renewed interest in ancient Greek and Roman texts that took root in the High Middle Ages, the Italian Renaissance began. The absorption of Latin texts had started before the Renaissance of the 12th century through contact with Arabs during the Crusades, but the availability of important Greek texts accelerated with the capture of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks, when many Byzantine scholars had to seek refuge in the West, particularly Italy.|$|E
25|$|During the Nepalese holiday of Gai Jatra ("Cow Pilgrimage"), {{every family}} {{who has lost}} a member during the {{previous}} year creates a tai out of bamboo branches, cloth, and paper decorations, in which are placed portraits of the deceased. As a cow traditionally leads the spirits of the dead into the afterlife, an actual or symbolic cow is used depending on local custom. The festival is <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> to dress up in a costume reminiscent of the western Halloween, with popular subjects including political commentary and satire.|$|E
