50|$|Torsion bar {{suspensions}} {{are used}} on combat vehicles and tanks like the T-72, Leopard 1, Leopard 2, M26 Pershing, M18 Hellcat, and the M1 Abrams (many tanks from World War II used this suspension), and on modern trucks and SUVs from Ford, Chrysler, GM, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Nissan, Isuzu and Toyota. Manufacturers change the torsion bar or key {{to adjust the}} ride height, usually to compensate for engine weight. While the ride height may be adjusted by turning the adjuster bolts on the stock torsion key, rotating the stock key too far can bend the <b>adjusting</b> <b>bolt</b> and place the shock piston outside its standard travel. Over-rotating the torsion bars can also cause the suspension to hit the bump-stop prematurely, causing a harsh ride. Aftermarket forged-metal torsion key kits use relocked adjuster keys to prevent over-rotation, and shock brackets to keep the piston travel in the stock range.|$|E
40|$|Objectives. Based on single-arm trial data (BOLT), sonidegib was {{approved}} in the US and EU to treat locally advanced basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) ineligible for curative surgery or radiotherapy. Vismodegib, the other approved targeted therapy, also was assessed in a single-arm trial (ERIVANCE). We examined the comparative {{effectiveness of the}} two drugs using a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) versus an unadjusted indirect comparison. Methods. After comparing trials and identifying potential prognostic factors, an MAIC was conducted to adjust for differences in key patient baseline characteristics. Due to BOLT’s small sample size, the number of matching variables was restricted to two. Efficacy results for sonidegib were generated so that selected baseline characteristics matched those from ERIVANCE and were compared with published ERIVANCE results. Results. Matching variables were baseline percentages of patients receiving prior radiotherapy and surgery. After weighting, sonidegib objective response rate (ORR) and median progression-free survival (PFS) were effectively unchanged (prematched versus postmatched ORR and PFS, 56. 1 % versus 56. 7 % and 22. 1 versus 22. 1 months, resp.). Vismodegib’s ORR and PFS were 47. 6 % and 9. 5 months. Conclusions. Comparative effectiveness of sonidegib versus vismodegib remains unchanged after <b>adjusting</b> <b>BOLT</b> patient-level data to match published ERIVANCE baseline percentages of patients receiving prior surgery and radiotherapy...|$|E
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} is that torsion bars, unlike coil springs, usually cannot {{provide a}} progressive spring rate. In most torsion bar systems, ride height (and therefore many handling features) may {{be changed by}} simply <b>adjusting</b> <b>bolts</b> that connect the torsion bars to the steering knuckles. In most cars {{with this type of}} suspension, swapping torsion bars for a different spring rate is usually an easy task.|$|R
50|$|The {{speedometer}} drive mechanism operated {{from the rear}} wheel, with a long cable to the speedometer. This drive mechanism wore out very quickly, as did any replacement, leading to no speedometer reading (never resolved). The early tachometer drive jutted from {{the right side of}} the engine, and was vulnerable to being struck and snapped off (relocated to front of engine). The primary chain tensioning bolt tended to loosen at inconvenient times. The rear chain <b>adjusting</b> <b>bolts</b> pushed, rather than pulled, the rear axle, and would bend, making them difficult to turn. Nor were there index marks to allow equal axle positioning on the right and left side of the swing arm. The ignition switch mount would break from vibration (later relocated).|$|R
3000|$|... sz. Thus, the {{compensation}} {{by moving the}} sub-reflector is more appropriate than by moving the feed in practice. For most reflector antenna in engineering, both the sub-reflector and feed are fixed by <b>bolts,</b> if we <b>adjust</b> the <b>bolts,</b> {{the position of the}} sub-reflector or feed could be changed in a small range.|$|R
50|$|Syncros was {{purchased}} in 2003 from Pacific by Tom Ritchey, who re-established the brand with Marshall Cant, former Product Manager at Rocky Mountain Bicycles, {{in the position}} of Brand Manager. Under the guidance of Tom Ritchey, Syncros has returned to its roots as a leading designer and manufacturer of high end mountain bike components. The original micro <b>adjust</b> 2 <b>bolt</b> seatpost is still manufactured but is the only original product still in the line up.|$|R
40|$|Technique for {{reworking}} stock bearings saves {{time and}} produces helicopter-rotor bearings ground more precisely. Split tapered ring {{at one end}} of threaded bolt expands to hold inside of inner race bearing assembly; nut, at other end of <b>bolt,</b> <b>adjusts</b> amount of spring tension. Piece of hardware grasps bearing firmly without interfering with grinding operation. Operation produces bearing of higher quality than commercially available bearings...|$|R
5000|$|The Ameli fires {{from an open}} bolt {{and uses}} a striker firing {{mechanism}} (in which the bolt and internally channeled firing pin perform {{the role of a}} striker). The trigger mechanism permits fully automatic fire only but the rate of fire can be <b>adjusted</b> by using <b>bolts</b> of varying weight, like in the MG 3. The lighter bolts will produce the maximum rate of fire (1,200 rounds/min) while a heavier bolt results in a rate of fire of approximately 850-900 rounds/min. The weapon features a cross-bolt type safety that disables the sear when pressed into the [...] "safe" [...] position.|$|R
5000|$|... "Laprade" [...] seatposts (newer) use {{a single}} {{vertical}} bolt (typically an Allen bolt) which when tightened pushes two rail-grabbing pieces together. The lower {{surface of the}} lower rail-grabbing piece is convex and grooved, matching a concave groved {{on the top of}} the seat post. The curve allows the up/down angle of the saddle to be <b>adjusted</b> when the <b>bolt</b> is loosened, and loosening also allows the rails to slide forward and back. Depending on the saddle angle, the vertical bolt is not perpendicular to the angle of the rails, but the grooves prevent the interface from slipping and adopting a completely horizontal angle. This angular adjustment mechanism is known as pivotal and is common on BMX bikes. Because the grooves are finer than the grooved discs in the sold-separately saddle clamp, sometimes Laprade-style posts are also marketed as [...] "microadjustable" [...] even though the adjustment is not continuous as with the Campagnolo style.|$|R
