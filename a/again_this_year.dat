To do this we investigated automated ways to manage cluster power consumption through management of processor per-core frequencies (both to over boost and under clock), fan speeds, water cooling, and powering down of accelerators when not in use. In addition to hardware controls, we are exploring automating auto building multiple configurations of applications, and parameter sweeps in order to better predict ideal conditions for peak performance.
