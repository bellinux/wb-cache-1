5|$|Hitler {{decided that}} the summer 1942 {{campaign}} would be concentrated in the south; efforts would be made to capture the oilfields in the Caucasus. The Battle of Stalingrad, a major turning point of the war, began on 23 August 1942 with a bombing campaign by the Luftwaffe. The Sixth Army entered the city, but because of its location on the front line, it was still possible for the Soviets to encircle and trap it there without reinforcements or supplies. When the Sixth Army was surrounded {{by the end of}} November in Operation Uranus, Göring promised that the Luftwaffe would be able to deliver a minimum of 300 tons of supplies to the trapped men every day. On the basis of these assurances, Hitler demanded that there be no retreat; they were to fight to the last man. Though some airlifts were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through,</b> the amount of supplies delivered never exceeded 120 tons per day. The remnants of the German Sixth Army—some 91,000 men out of an army of 285,000—surrendered in early February 1943; only 5,000 of these captives survived the Russian prisoner of war camps to see Germany again.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} begins {{six weeks after}} the end of the first, where Magnus works hard to defeat the Cabal and save Ashley, whom the Cabal {{transformed}} to a vampire-hybrid superabnormal, one of six tasked to destroy the Sanctuary Network. When the superabnormals arrive at the Old City Sanctuary, Magnus is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> to Ashley, who recognises her in time to save her from another superabnormal, and then teleports. Because an electromagnetic field is active, it would mean whoever teleports inside would be vaporized. Despite this, Magnus believes Ashley's life energy may be in the electromagnetic field's buffer. When it does not, she is forced to accept that Ashley has died. Because of her death, and other loved ones because of her longevity, she tried to find a way to age at a normal rate again. She finds an elixir used by the Mayans in Honduras, but it has the side effect of turning humans into zombie-like creatures. After being shown the potential consequences of the elixir's release by an incorporeal guardian, she decides to leave it behind.|$|E
25|$|For his part, Ya`qub {{traveled}} through Khuzistan, {{during which he}} gained the defection of a former general of the caliph's, Abi'l-Saj Devdad, and entered Iraq. The caliphal general Masrur al-Balkhi managed to slow down his progress by flooding the land outside Wasit, but the Saffarid army was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> this and he entered Wasit on March 24. Leaving Wasit, he set for the town of Dayr al-`Aqul, which was about fifty miles from Baghdad. According to one source, Ya`qub did not actually expect the caliph to offer battle; instead he would give in to any demands that the Saffarid had. Al-Mu'tamid, however, sent al-Muwaffaq to stop him. The two armies met at Istarband, between Dayr al-`Aqul and Sib Bani Kuma.|$|E

He complained {{that he had not}} been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> to President Aquino by telephone during the siege, and criticized the way the siege was handled. The government chartered two airplanes carrying doctors and counsellors to Manila to support the survivors of the incident, and to fly the Hong Kong victims home. The bodies of all eight victims, along with most of the survivors, were returned to Hong Kong on August 25, 2010. A memorial ceremony was held as the victims arrived on the tarmac of Hong Kong International Airport, attended, amongst others, by Chief Secretary for Administration Henry Tang and Secretary for Security Ambrose Lee.|$|E
25|$|Following {{even more}} {{training}} in northeastern Dijon, on August 24, the 90th Infantry Division entered a {{sector of the}} front {{on the eastern side}} of the St. Mihiel salient. At the time Pershing, now a full general and Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the AEF on the Western Front, was getting ready for his first major offensive–closing off the salient. Allen's unit was to form the right pivot in the offensive. It started early on September 12 when the offensive began. After a rolling barrage, the division kept moving ahead. Over the next nine hours, Allen's men captured their objectives and by September 16, the Americans had reduced the salient. After the salient was eliminated, Pershing planned for the American forces to attack west at Meuse-Argonne. In the beginning, Allen's unit stayed close to St. Mihiel, covered sectors already left vacate by the troops who went west, and grouped together their positions. Once the battle had become more intense, Allen and his men entered the lines close to Bantheville. The 90th advanced slowly and Allen relieved officers who he found to be incompetent or weak. The division was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> the Meuse River near Stenay only several days before the signing of the Armistice of November 11, 1918.|$|E
25|$|Luftwaffe tactics were {{influenced}} by their fighters. The Bf 110 proved too vulnerable to the nimble single-engined RAF fighters. This meant the bulk of fighter escort duties fell on the Bf 109. Fighter tactics were then complicated by bomber crews who demanded closer protection. After the hard-fought battles of 15 and 18 August, Göring met with his unit leaders. During this conference, {{the need for the}} fighters to meet up on time with the bombers was stressed. It was also decided that one bomber Gruppe could only be properly protected by several Gruppen of 109s. In addition, Göring stipulated that as many fighters as possible were to be left free for Freie Jagd ("Free Hunts": a free-roving fighter sweep preceded a raid to try to sweep defenders out of the raid's path). The Ju 87 units, which had suffered heavy casualties, were only to be used under favourable circumstances. In early September, due to increasing complaints from the bomber crews about RAF fighters seemingly <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> the escort screen, Göring ordered an increase in close escort duties. This decision shackled many of the Bf 109s to the bombers and, although they were more successful at protecting the bomber forces, casualties amongst the fighters mounted primarily because they were forced to fly and manoeuvre at reduced speeds.|$|E

500|$|Liu Xia {{was under}} house-arrest almost {{immediately}} after the announcement, and was escorted to Liaoning to visit her imprisoned husband. She reported that she was denied visitors, her telephones were repeatedly down, and complained that even her elderly mother had not been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> to her. Visitors were denied entrance to her residential compound, including Norwegian diplomats {{who had tried to}} visit her on 12 October; she was able to send out a few messages through Twitter. Chinese police stationed there cordoned off the area. Thus, journalists and well-wishers were kept at bay for several hours after the announcement; as she was being taken away to see her husband, Reuters heard her say [...] "they are forcing me to leave Beijing". Dissident groups reported on 18 October that numerous supporters and associates of Liu may have been detained by police—that Tiananmen Mother Ding Zilin, and her husband Jiang Peikun, had not been seen or heard of for four days, and that their phones were cut off. Writer Jiang Qisheng went missing just days after the Nobel announcement.|$|E

500|$|Milian wrote So Amazin {{based on}} her own life, and each record pertained to a {{different}} aspect, especially focused on relationships. During early production of the album, Milian was dealing with her break-up with actor Nick Cannon and wrote several records based on that. While writing the mid-tempo track [...] "My Lovin' Goes", Milian felt she turned a new leaf. She said, [...] "you see the change in So Amazin where life was just really coming into place. I was finally becoming the woman that I feel that I am right now. Also, I was leaving old love behind and learning about new types of love. Which is great, whether it be life, and also the dating scene is really nice." [...] Two tracks which Milian wrote about Cannon were [...] "Gonna Tell Everybody" [...] and [...] "Who's Gonna Ride". When Milian and Cool & Dre had discussions, her break-up with Cannon was regularly mentioned. Milian felt a need to express herself, and writing became therapeutic for Milian; she was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> the break-up by writing songs. The production by Cool & Dre also inspired Milian to write the tracks, as she felt comfortable with them {{and was able to}} be open.|$|E
500|$|... "Pusher" [...] {{received}} overwhelmingly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V.

Though he praised Modell and the climax, he felt that Holly was a stereotype and [...] "the implication that Modell is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> to her because of her fear walks that weird line between plausible and not entirely necessary". Handlen also {{felt that it was}} [...] "an excellent starting point" [...] for someone who wanted to get into the series. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Pusher" [...] a B+, writing, [...] "Much inscrutable warmth between Mulder and Scully parallels some inscrutable detective work. But the climactic mental tug-of-war between Mulder and Pusher makes up for any lapses in logic". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two called Gilligan's script [...] "witty and clever" [...] and noted that it was [...] "a triumph". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson praised Wisden's performance as Robert Modell, calling his portrayal [...] "spot on". Paula Vitaris of Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it a rare four stars out of four.

500|$|With Rosberg {{retiring}} from Formula One {{at the end}} of 1986 season, underrated Swede Stefan Johansson filled the McLaren seat alongside Prost for the [...] season. Even though McLaren had introduced the new Steve Nichols designed MP4/3 after three seasons with the MP4/2 model (Barnard had departed for Ferrari), the TAG engines were not the force they had been previously, lagging behind in power and with unreliability previously unseen. He never gave up though and challenged Piquet and Mansell almost until the end, winning three races and breaking Jackie Stewart's record for race victories by winning for the 28th time at the Portuguese Grand Prix. Prost considers his win in the opening round in Brazil as his best and most rewarding race ever. The Williams-Hondas had been dominant during qualifying, and Prost started fifth on the grid with a time three seconds slower than Mansell's pole time. Knowing he didn't have the qualifying speed, he instead worked on his race set-up, and with everyone else going for a high-downforce set-up, the Frenchman went the other way. The set-up meant less tyre wear, thanks to slower speeds in the corners while going fast down the straights. With his car having less tyre wear than his rivals, Prost was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> the 61 laps of the abrasive Jacarepaguá Circuit with only two stops compared to the three or more by his rivals (Piquet pitted for tyres 3 times within the first 40 laps). Prost finished 40 seconds in front of Piquet, with Johansson a further 16 seconds back in third.|$|E
500|$|Lisa visits Smithers, {{owner of}} the world's largest Malibu Stacy collection, and asks for help in finding Lovell, who was ousted from the Malibu Stacy company in 1974.

Lisa and Lovell decide {{to create a new}} talking doll, Lisa Lionheart, voiced by Lisa herself. The doll is quietly released, but the executives of Malibu Stacy have a meeting in which they agree that Lisa's doll is a real threat because it might hurt the sales of their doll. Meanwhile, Grampa struggles with his new job at Krusty Burger, suffering a war flashback at the drive-in and losing his false teeth making burgers. He soon becomes angry at the way seniors are treated, and quits. After a slow initial release, Lisa Lionheart suddenly gains popularity among the fans of Malibu Stacy after being featured in Kent Brockman's news show. At the mall, as kids, and Smithers, rush out to buy Lisa Lionheart, a cart of Malibu Stacy dolls with new hats is wheeled right into the path of the group running for the Lionheart display. Lisa appeals to them that it is just the same doll with a [...] "stupid, cheap" [...] hat, but they all prefer to stick with Malibu Stacy, largely due to the encouragement of Smithers, except for one little girl, who leaves with a Lisa Lionheart doll. Despite the fact that the doll is a failure, Lisa takes heart that her message was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> to at least one little girl.|$|E
