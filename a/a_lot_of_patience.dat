500|$|Like other Disney media {{products}} {{which are}} often localized through Disney Character Voices International, Frozen was translated and dubbed into 41 languages (compared with only 15 for The Lion King). A major challenge was to find sopranos capable of matching Menzel's warm vocal tone and three-octave vocal range in their native languages. Rick Dempsey, the unit's senior executive, regarded the process of translating the film as [...] "exceptionally challenging"; he explained, [...] "It's a difficult juggling act {{to get the right}} intent of the lyrics and also have it match rhythmically to the music. And then {{you have to go back}} and adjust for lip sync! ...requires <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>patience</b> and precision." [...] Lopez explained that they were told by Disney to remove complex wordplay and puns from their songs, to ensure the film was easily translatable and had globally appealing lyrics. For the casting of dubbed versions, Disney required native speakers in order to [...] "ensure that the film feels 'local'." [...] They used Bell and Menzel's voices as their [...] "blueprint" [...] in casting, and tried to match the voices [...] "as much as possible," [...] meaning that they auditioned approximately 200 singers to fill the 41 slots for Elsa alone. For nearly 15 dubbed versions, they cast Elsa's singing and speaking parts separately, since not all vocalists could act the part they were singing. After casting all the other roles for all 41 languages, the international cast ended up including more than 900 people, who voiced their roles through approximately 1,300 recording sessions.|$|E

To turn the tide, decision makers look for revitalisation strategies. Are there any solutions? Making use of theoretical insights, empirical findings and anecdotal evidence from the Netherlands, we suggest that town centre revitalisation {{is a matter of}} connecting people, place and partnership. First, strategies should be based on an understanding of how customers (people) behave. Secondly, redesign of the physical environment (place) might be needed, since visitors prefer compact centres that are built on a human scale and known for a unique profile. Finally, close collaboration between a wide range of local stakeholders (partnership) is essential. We conclude that town centre revitalisation is possible, but takes <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> energy and <b>patience</b> from the actors involved...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The current {{opinion is}} that split {{thickness}} skin grafts are not suitable to reconstruct a degloved foot sole.
