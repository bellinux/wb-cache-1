5|$|In {{the same}} year, Delius began a {{fruitful}} association with German supporters of his music, the conductors Hans Haym, Fritz Cassirer and Alfred Hertz at Elberfeld, and Julius Buths at Düsseldorf. Haym conducted Over the Hills <b>and</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Away,</b> which he gave under its German title Über die Berge in die Ferne on 13 November 1897, {{believed to be}} the first time Delius's music was heard in Germany. In 1899 Hertz gave a Delius concert in St. James's Hall in London, which included Over the Hills <b>and</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Away,</b> a choral piece, Mitternachtslied, and excerpts from the opera Koanga. This occasion was an unusual opportunity for an unknown composer at a time when any sort of orchestral concert was a rare event in London. In spite of encouraging reviews, Delius's orchestral music was not heard again in an English concert hall until 1907.|$|E
5|$|Due to her {{commitment}} to the band, Turunen {{was not able to}} concentrate sufficiently on her schoolwork and her academic studies were interrupted. In 1998, Nightwish published their second album, Oceanborn. This album lacked the earlier elements of folk and ambient music, and instead focused on fast, melodic keyboard and guitar lines and Turunen's dramatic voice. In addition to the Oceanborn Europe Tour (1999), Turunen sang solo in Waltari's rock-themed ballet Evankeliumi (also known as Evangelicum) in several sold-out performances at the Finnish National Opera. In 2000 and 2001, Nightwish recorded Wishmaster and Over the Hills <b>and</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Away</b> and toured Europe and South America (the Wishmaster World Tour). During the Wishmaster World Tour, Turunen met Argentine businessman Marcelo Cabuli whom she married in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Crown Jewels—which mainly {{date from}} the {{accession}} of Charles II—the jewels are not official regalia or insignia. Much of the collection was designed for queens and queen consorts, though some kings have added to the collection. A few diamonds {{were brought to the}} United Kingdom from the British colonies <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> lands as the spoils of war. Most of the jewellery was purchased from other European heads of state and members of the aristocracy, or handed down by older generations of the Royal Family, often as birthday and wedding presents. In recent years, Elizabeth has worn them in her capacity as Queen of Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and can be seen wearing jewels from her collection in official portraits made specially for these realms.|$|E

5|$|Wildflower is {{the second}} studio album {{recorded}} by Australian electronic music group the Avalanches. It was first released for streaming on Apple Music on 1 July 2016, and saw a full release a week later on 8 July. It was issued through Modular Recordings, Astralwerks, XL Recordings, and EMI. Production of the album was led by Robbie Chater with assistance from Tony Di Blasi and lasted nearly 16 years, commencing shortly {{after the release of}} their debut album, Since I Left You, in November 2000 and not concluding until March 2016. The album features multiple guest collaborators providing vocals and live instrumentation across its 21 tracks. Wildflower also features extensive sampling, especially from 1960s psychedelic music, and relates to the era through themes of counterculture and anti-establishment. Chater described the album's structure as a road trip from a hyperrealistic urban environment to somewhere remote <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> while on LSD.|$|E

25|$|Later, Holopainen confessed that, at that time, he seriously started {{thinking}} about breaking Nightwish up. After a gig in Russia, he sent a text message to fellow musician Tony Kakko of metal band Sonata Arctica, telling him {{that he did not}} think he had a band any longer, and asking him what plans he had for next year. After Nightwish's last gig for the Over the Hills <b>and</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Away</b> tour in 2001, Holopainen called their labels Drakkar and Spinefarm, unofficially declaring Nightwish was over. He told them he might produce another album, but he'd never perform another show with the band. The same message was also written on the band's message board.|$|E

500|$|Delius's Paris {{years were}} musically productive. His symphonic poem Paa Vidderne was {{performed}} in Christiania in 1891 and in Monte Carlo in 1894; Gunnar Heiberg commissioned Delius to provide incidental music for his play Folkeraadet in 1897; and Delius's second opera, The Magic Fountain, was accepted for staging at Prague, but the project fell through for unknown reasons. [...] Other works of the period were the fantasy overture Over the Hills <b>and</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Away</b> (1895–97) and orchestral variations, Appalachia: Variations on an Old Slave Song (1896, rewritten in 1904 for voices and orchestra).|$|E
500|$|Amid his {{concert and}} {{teaching}} duties, Grainger {{found time to}} rescore many of his works (a habit he continued throughout his life) and also to compose new pieces: his Children's March: Over the Hills <b>and</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Away,</b> and the orchestral version of The Power of Rome and the Christian Heart both originated in this period. [...] He also began to develop the technique of elastic scoring, a form of flexible orchestration [...] which enabled works to be [...] performed by different numbers of players and instrument types, from small chamber groups [...] up to full orchestral strength.|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Ben Witherington III {{points out}} an {{inconsistency}} {{related to the}} James Ossuary. He {{points out that the}} James Ossuary came from Silwan, not Talpiot. In addition, the James Ossuary had dirt on it that [...] "matched up with the soil in that particular spot in Jerusalem." [...] In his opinion, this is problematic, because [...] "the ossuaries that came out of Talpiot came out of a rock cave from a different place, and without such soil in it." [...] Therefore, he believes {{that it is difficult to}} believe that the one known family member of Jesus was buried separately <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> from Jesus' family.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1962 interview, Tarkovsky argued, [...] "All art, of course, is intellectual, but for me, all the arts, and cinema {{even more}} so, must above all be {{emotional}} and act upon the heart."

Recurring motifs are dreams, memory, childhood, running water accompanied by fire, rain indoors, reflections, levitation, and characters re-appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera. He once said, [...] "Juxtaposing a person with {{an environment that is}} boundless, collating him with a countless number of people passing by close to him <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>away,</b> relating a person to the whole world, that is the meaning of cinema.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after the}} release of Over the Hills <b>and</b> <b>Far</b> <b>Away,</b> Nightwish met what has been {{described}} as one of their hardest points as a band. The issues centered on the bassist, Sami Vänskä, who had started misbehaving towards the band, according to Holopainen, by missing appointments and failing to take gigs as seriously as the other members did. After the band discussed his behavior with Vänskä several times, without getting any change, everyone simply stopped caring and tensions grew. Meanwhile, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen had started complaining about his role in the band, feeling like [...] "a hired gun who would only do what he's asked to". According to their music teacher, Plamen Dimov, he and Holopainen have totally different characters, and thus difficulties were expected to arise. But Vuorinen was told to stay cool and [...] "bite the bullet", and the problem was never addressed again.|$|E
