5|$|Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) allows data packets to be {{used for}} {{synchronous}} voice communications. The data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real-time, synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types of data traffic which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered in advance (i.e. audio and video) without detriment. That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking {{place at the same time}} and the network is enabled for prioritization i.e. a private corporate style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.|$|E

The best quality of reclaimed sewage water comes from adding a gravitational filtering step, after the chemical and biological cleansing. This method uses small ponds in which the water seeps through the sand into the aquifer in about 400 days, then is pumped out as clear purified water. This is nearly the same process used in the space station water recycling system, which turns urine and feces into purified drinking water, oxygen and manure.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Knowledge about facet {{morphology}} {{has already}} been discussed extensively in literature but is limited regarding asymmetry {{and its relation to}} facet degeneration. Method. Facet dimensions, surface area, curvature, and degeneration of the superior facets were measured in 85 dried human vertebrae from the anatomical collection of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. The vertebrae were analysed using the Microscribe G 2 X digitizer (Immersion Co., San Jose, CA) and a grading system for the evaluation of cervical facet degeneration. Coordinates were processed mathematically to evaluate articular tropism. The statistical analysis includes the paired t-test and the Pearson correlation. Results. On average, no systematic differences between the left and right facets were found concerning morphology and degeneration. However, there were significant differences regardless of the side-occurrence. There was a significant correlation between the dimensions of the total facet surface and the degree of degeneration but not for the recognizable joint surface. Conclusions. Facet tropism of the upper joint facets occurred often in the cervical spine but without side preference. <b>A</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> degeneration asymmetry was associated with <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> facet joint dimension asymmetry...|$|R

25|$|Fillings in {{pastries}} {{are sometimes}} made of finely ground poppy seeds mixed with butter or milk and sugar. The ground filling {{is used in}} poppy seed rolls and some croissants and may be flavored with lemon or orange zest, rum and vanilla with raisins, heavy cream, cinnamon, and chopped blanched almonds or walnuts added. For sweet baked goods, sometimes instead of sugar a tablespoon of jam, or other sweet binding agent, like syrup is substituted. The poppy seed for fillings are best when they are finely and freshly ground because this will make <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the pastry filling's texture and taste. Some recipes for Mohnstriezel use poppy seed soaked in water for two hours or boiled in milk. A recipe for Ukrainian poppyseed cake recommends preparing the seeds by immersing in boiling water, straining and soaking in milk overnight.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{substitution}} {{and coordination}} polyhedra explain this common feature of minerals. In nature, minerals are not pure substances, and are contaminated by whatever other elements {{are present in}} the given chemical system. As a result, it is possible for one element to be substituted for another. Chemical substitution will occur between ions of a similar size and charge; for example, K+ will not substitute for Si4+ because of chemical and structural incompatibilities caused by <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> size and charge. A common example of chemical substitution is that of Si4+ by Al3+, which are close in charge, size, and abundance in the crust. In the example of plagioclase, there are three cases of substitution. Feldspars are all framework silicates, which have a silicon-oxygen ratio of 2:1, and the space for other elements is given by the substitution of Si4+ by Al3+ to give a base unit of −; without the substitution, the formula would be charge-balanced as SiO2, giving quartz. The significance of this structural property will be explained further by coordination polyhedra. The second substitution occurs between Na+ and Ca2+; however, the difference in charge has to accounted for by making a second substitution of Si4+ by Al3+.|$|E

The White Sox won eight straight games, the longest winning streak in the AL to that point in the season, and had done so with the help of Doby's six home runs during the eight-game stretch. [...] "You know, when we dealt for Doby, we weren't worried about Larry. We knew he'd come through", Comiskey said. Doby finished the season with a [...]268 batting average and led the team with 24 home runs and 102 RBIs. Chicago finished 1956 in third place in the AL with an 85–69 record.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Field {{data were}} sampled by {{the method of}} {{contiguous}} grid quadrate. The spatial patterns of Pseudolarix amabilis populations were studied by the following methods: Dispersal index (C), David moores index (I), Lloyd index (m*/m), Morisita index (Iδ), Parameter of negative index (K) and Cassie index (1 /K). The quadrate variance analysis, Greig-Smith and Kershaw methods were used to study the spatial distribution pattern, pattern scale and pattern intensity of Pinus armandi population at different sizes. The result showed that P. amabilis population is most clumped. The result indicated the pattern intensity was decreasing with the size increasing and a single peak value appeared in the curve with the area increasing. There was a slow change in the pattern intensity of population, which means a smaller variation <b>in</b> environment and <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the relative density of population patches during diffusion process...|$|R

Regardless of whether you want to "go public" with your giving, you can make <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the world by simply talking about and engaging with the causes you care most about. Going public about your giving or your interests is a form of leadership. It's a chance for givers to shine a light on issues that matter to them [...] and become a role model for others. When your friends, classmates, or others in your community find out that you feel strongly about a certain issue, it may inspire them to do the same. In that way, you are not only raising money for a cause you care about, but also raising awareness for it as well. (Check out Leadership in Philanthropy, another guide in the Teen Philanthropy Café series, {{to learn more about the}} ways philanthropists lead.)
