50|$|Discrete control {{functions}} can {{be represented}} by discrete levels of current sent over a loop. This would allow multiple control functions to be operated over {{a single pair of}} wires. Currents required for a specific function vary from one application or manufacturer to another. There is no specific current that is tied to a single meaning. It is almost universal that 0 mA indicates the circuit has failed. In the case of a fire alarm, 6 mA could be normal, 15 mA could mean a fire has been detected, and 0 mA would produce a trouble indication, telling the monitoring site the <b>alarm</b> <b>circuit</b> had failed. Some devices, such as two-way radio remote control consoles, can reverse the polarity of currents and can multiplex audio onto a DC current.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the system itself, security alarms are often coupled with a monitoring service. In {{the event of an}} alarm, the premises control unit contacts a central monitoring station.

Such signals may be transmitted via dedicated <b>alarm</b> <b>circuits,</b> telephone lines, or the internet.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fault in}} the ADF system made it {{impossible}} to be used as an approach aid. The VOR flag alarm was set too high and the glide-slope deflection sensitivity indication was set 50% more than its usual operational setting. It didn't prevent the system, but was rather [...] "exacting for the pilots". The faulty settings of the glide-slope <b>alarm</b> <b>circuit</b> prevented the flag appearing until the two signals were unusable or not received. If the faulty unit received an [...] "unsatisfactory signal", the pointer could move to the mid-position. The pilot on the left seat could not notice this failure. This is dangerous. If the pointer moved to the mid-position, the crew would have thought that they were on the correct glide path.

50|$|Modern alarm {{controls}} are solid-state devices, {{and do not}} use the relays that the older alarm panels used to go into alarm. They make use of relays to modulate the alarm notification device as needed. And they use a relay to seize the telephone line to communicate to the monitoring station. Most switching devices are N.C. (normally closed) circuits, so when the device is not in an <b>alarm</b> condition, the <b>circuit</b> is closed. Most <b>alarm</b> <b>circuits</b> (zones) are also set up to open or close on reading a certain resistance, usually between 1K and 5K ohms when inactive and double the value when active. This wiring system is called dual loop and allows for both alarm and anti-tamper detections to be incorporated into one circuit (anti-tamper occurs when the resistance level moves outside normal open/close values). This is the standard circuit in most modern systems.|$|R
