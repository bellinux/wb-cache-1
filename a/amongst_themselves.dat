5|$|Early beefsteaks {{were held}} in a relaxed, men-only atmosphere, with diners sitting on crates and eating with their fingers off of rough, improvised tables in saloons, rental halls, or {{residential}} basements. Food and drink were {{the focus of the}} evening, and entertainment often consisted simply of those present telling stories and singing <b>amongst</b> <b>themselves.</b> Brass bands were sometimes hired.|$|E
5|$|An {{expedition}} {{was immediately}} {{prepared to take}} punitive action against the Ghassanids. Muhammad appointed Zayd ibn Harithah as {{the commander of the}} force. In the event of Zayd's death, the command was to be taken over by Ja`far ibn Abī Tālib, and if Jafar were to be killed, the command would {{be in the hands of}} `Abd Allah ibn Rawahah. In the event that all three were killed, the men of the expedition were to select a commander from <b>amongst</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E
5|$|Even before Diarmait's demise, the Uí Chennselaig {{began to}} fight <b>amongst</b> <b>themselves</b> in a {{struggle}} that was almost certainly an after-effect of Diarmait's sons' untimely deaths. Specifically, the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters, and the eleventhfourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen reveal that Domnall battled {{against the forces of}} his own first cousin once removed, Donnchad mac Domnaill Remair (died 1089), before Diarmait's ally, Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1086), was able to intervene and restore order in the Kingdom of Leinster.|$|E
500|$|Actuaries have {{appeared}} in works of fiction including literature, theater, television, and film. At times, they have been portrayed as [...] "math-obsessed, socially disconnected individuals with shockingly bad comb-overs", which {{has resulted in a}} mixed response <b>amongst</b> actuaries <b>themselves</b> [...]|$|R

25|$|A {{complex social}} and {{political}} structure developed in the prison, <b>amongst</b> the inmates <b>themselves,</b> and between the inmates and the guards.|$|R
5|$|In {{the case}} of a gallant and daring act having been {{performed}} by a squadron, ship's company, or detached body of individuals (such as a security detachment) in which all persons were deemed equally brave and deserving of the Victoria Cross, a ballot is to be drawn; the commissioned and non-commissioned officers each select one of their own, and the private soldiers or seamen select from <b>amongst</b> <b>themselves</b> two individuals. This provision with modification is included in the current warrant but has not be used since the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of those}} in the protest {{movements}} were young children {{at the time of the}} invasion and had been educated under the Indonesian system. They resented the repression of Timorese cultural and political life at the expense of the Indonesian, were ambivalent of Indonesian economic development, and spoke Portuguese <b>amongst</b> <b>themselves,</b> stressing their Portuguese heritage. Seeking help from Portugal for self-determination, they considered Indonesia an occupying force. Abroad, Fretilin's members—most notably former journalist José Ramos-Horta (later to be Prime Minister and President)—pushed their cause in diplomatic forums.|$|E
5|$|Daljit {{manages to}} crawl to the {{recording}} room, where Karan {{is still on}} air. When Karan understands {{that he has been}} shot, they speak <b>amongst</b> <b>themselves</b> for the last time, regarding the others, about Sue and about Daljit's love for her. They are then killed by police commandos while laughing. It is then revealed that McKinley described the third kind of people he came across as being the ones who embraced death as a friend and an equal, with a heartfelt laughter. After their death, the public reacts with outrage and expresses urge to bring Indian politics to justice, following the motives of all the boys.|$|E
50|$|Interactivity: {{the most}} direct route to {{learning}} {{is to be found}} in the interactivity between teachers and students and <b>amongst</b> the students <b>themselves.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Dell {{is a small}} park in the Milverton area of Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, England. Although it is {{not well}} known nationally (like The Jephson Gardens) or {{regionally}} (like Newbold Comyn), it is a well used and popular park <b>amongst</b> Leamingtonians <b>themselves.</b> The park {{takes its name from}} the fact that it is situated in a small sunken hollow, or dell.|$|R

5|$|In 1643, Governor Winthrop became {{embroiled in}} a {{controversy}} over the propriety of taking sides in a power struggle going on in neighbouring French Acadia. Endecott pointed out {{that he should have}} let the French fight <b>amongst</b> <b>themselves</b> without English involvement, as this would weaken them both. The 1644 governor's election became a referendum on Winthrop's policy; Endecott was elected governor, with Winthrop as his deputy. During his one-year term he oversaw the division of the colony into four counties: Suffolk, Essex, Middlesex, and Norfolk. The ascent of the Salem-based Endecott also prompted an attempt by other Salem residents to have the colonial capital relocated there; the attempt was rejected by the governor's council of assistants.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} the {{electrons}} are close enough to thermal equilibrium that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even {{when there is a}} significant deviation from a Maxwellian energy distribution function, for example, due to UV radiation, energetic particles, or strong electric fields. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium <b>amongst</b> <b>themselves</b> much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.|$|E
5|$|Marx's {{ideas have}} had a {{profound}} impact on world politics and intellectual thought. Followers of Marx have frequently debated <b>amongst</b> <b>themselves</b> over how to interpret Marx's writings and apply his concepts to the modern world. The legacy of Marx's thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of which sees itself as Marx's most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies include Leninism, Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, Luxemburgism and libertarian Marxism. Various currents have also developed in academic Marxism, often under influence of other views, resulting in structuralist Marxism, historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, analytical Marxism and Hegelian Marxism.|$|E
50|$|As this harbour was {{not very}} secure, it {{was moved to the}} more {{protected}} waters of Quemchi. This became quite an important place, where many people established <b>themselves,</b> <b>amongst</b> them Vicente Lobos Toledo from Valparaíso.|$|R

5000|$|Scenes of play {{fall into}} two categories: [...] "enrichment scenes", {{focusing}} on character development, and [...] "conflict scenes", focusing on clashes between heroes and villains, or <b>amongst</b> the heroes <b>themselves.</b> The outcome of scenes is settled with standard playing cards.|$|R
5|$|Researchers in {{the field}} {{advocate}} a teaching style that incorporates group problem-solving activities and demands higher-level thought. According to this process, a teacher initially poses a single question {{in a number of}} ways. Next, students discuss the problem with the teacher and <b>amongst</b> <b>themselves,</b> asking questions. In forming these questions, students are actively brainstorming and recalling prior knowledge. At this point, the teacher provides specific conditions of the issue discussed, and students must adapt their prior knowledge, along with that of their peers, to generate a solution. Other curriculum designs tailored to young children such as “” incorporate practices which aim to improve students’ capacity to shift and prolong attention as well as think “outside the box” (i.e. generate creative solutions).|$|E
5|$|The {{task force}} then sailed around Euboea {{to the first}} major target, Eretria. According to Herodotus, the Eretrians were divided <b>amongst</b> <b>themselves</b> as to {{the best course of}} action; whether to flee to the highlands, or undergo a siege, or to submit to the Persians. In the event, the {{majority}} decision was to remain in the city. The Eretrians made no attempt to stop the Persians landing, or advancing, and thus allowed themselves to be besieged. For six days the Persians attacked the walls, with losses on both sides; however, on the seventh day two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed the city to the Persians. The city was razed, and temples and shrines were looted and burned. Furthermore, according to Darius's commands, the Persians enslaved all the remaining townspeople.|$|E
5|$|The terrans are a young {{species with}} psionic potential. The terrans of the Koprulu sector descend from the {{survivors}} of a disastrous 23rd century colonization mission from Earth. Compared to the protoss and zerg, the terrans are technologically inferior, lacking in genetic-diversity, and highly factionalized. The seven dominant government factions are the Moebius Foundation, the Kel-Morian Combine, the Tarsonis Republic, the Mar Sara Republic, the Terran Dominion, the Umojan Protectorate, and the United Earth Directorate. Terrans are {{in a constant state}} of conflict: whenever they are not caught in the two-front pitched battle crossfire with their alien neighbors' interstellar conflicts, they endure frequent assassinations, civil wars and revolutions <b>amongst</b> <b>themselves.</b> Nevertheless, terran ingenuity and unyielding stubbornness has kept them from extinction; they stand as one of the three dominant species of the galaxy.|$|E
50|$|Digital {{collections}} {{reduce the}} need to travel to archives, search engines enable relevant material to be found more quickly, the availability of materials online reduces the pressure on paper resources in the library and enable more students {{to use the same}} materials simultaneously, and, lastly, e-learning tools provide the opportunity to extend the contact time between teachers and students, and <b>amongst</b> students <b>themselves.</b> E-learning also opens up apparently limitless possibilities for distance learning, allowing students across the globe to learn together online.|$|R
50|$|Many former {{students}} have distinguished <b>themselves,</b> <b>amongst</b> {{which there are}} Georges Claude (5th year), founder of Air Liquide, Paul Langevin (7th year), physicist and inventor and Frédéric Joliot-Curie (39th year), founder of the CEA and Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935 with his wife Irène.|$|R
50|$|At the larval stage, common tussock {{caterpillars}} {{are able}} to camouflage <b>themselves</b> <b>amongst</b> various tall and short grasses which serve as the host plants. This ability to camouflage against host plants continues when A. antipodum develop into pupae, or reach the chrysalis stage of development.|$|R
5|$|While {{walking in}} the woods, Jake begins {{performing}} acrobatic moves. Finn attempts to follow, and eventually the two get trapped in a massive spider web. The owners of the web, two large spiders named Ed (voiced by Bobcat Goldthwait) and Barb (voiced by Susie Essman) return, bickering <b>amongst</b> <b>themselves.</b> The argument turns towards Barb's difficulty spinning webs, and she runs away. While Ed wraps Jake in a cocoon, Finn tries to offer relationship advice to Ed; Finn tells the spider to get a gift for his wife, and Ed runs {{off into the woods}} to find something.|$|E
5|$|A {{vote was}} taken {{after a long}} day of speeches, each colony casting a single vote, as always. The {{delegation}} for each colony numbered from two to seven members, and each delegation voted <b>amongst</b> <b>themselves</b> to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between Thomas McKean (who voted yes) and George Read (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. Edward Rutledge of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.|$|E
5|$|Another {{element of}} the Commonwealth army {{consisted}} of various private armies fielded by the most powerful magnates. In time of peace these consisted of usually small regiments {{of a few hundred}} men, but at their extreme they could number up to 10,000, including cavalry and artillery. In some instances the magnate contribution could surpass that of the main Commonwealth army on the frontlines, although often the magnates preferred to save their troops, as they were not compensated for the state for their contributions. The troops were paid for and equipped by the richest of the noble families, such as the Opaliński, Lubomirski, Potocki, Ossoliński, Zamoyski, Koniecpolski, Sieniawski, Żółkiewski, Sapieha, Chodkiewicz, Pac and Radziwiłł families. This {{was one of the reasons}} why the magnates played a major role in Polish politics, and on occasion, allowed them to engage in bloody civil wars (such as the Lithuanian Civil War in 1700) <b>amongst</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1017 (Kannin 1, 9th month): Michinaga made {{a pilgrimage}} to the Iwashimizu Shrine {{accompanied}} by many courtiers. The travelers divided <b>themselves</b> <b>amongst</b> 15 boats for a floating trip down the Yotogawa River. One of the vessels overturned, and more than 30 people lost their lives.|$|R
40|$|With the {{emergence}} of the Internet of Things, interactions between humans and machines and indeed <b>amongst</b> machines <b>themselves</b> can be better understood using Leontiev's activity theory. This theory has been relevant to Human-Computer Interaction research for some time, but this paper revisits the underlying concepts with a particular emphasis on the Internet of Things. Newer approaches may be more appropriate to represent complex activities within their wider context, as opposed to the traditional (and limited) view of mediated activities at an individual level. <br/...|$|R
60|$|So {{they who}} had fought face to face, feasted side by side, {{pledging}} {{one another in the}} wine cup, as was the custom; and Haafager's men, knowing <b>themselves</b> <b>amongst</b> friends, cast aside their arms, and when the feast was done, being weary, they lay down to sleep.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in the 7th {{millennium}} BCE, {{human populations}} {{moved into the}} Chadian basin in great numbers. By {{the end of the}} 1st millennium AD, a series of states and empires had risen and fallen in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region. France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa. In 1960, Chad obtained independence under the leadership of François Tombalbaye. Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting civil war in 1965. In 1979 the rebels conquered the capital {{and put an end to}} the south's hegemony. However, the rebel commanders fought <b>amongst</b> <b>themselves</b> until Hissène Habré defeated his rivals. He was overthrown in 1990 by his general Idriss Déby. Since 2003 the Darfur crisis in Sudan has spilt over the border and destabilised the nation, with hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees living in and around camps in eastern Chad. Unsustainable high birth rates and a lack of agriculture let the country persist in poverty.|$|E
5|$|Bonnet further {{tried to}} {{disguise}} {{his return to}} piracy by engaging in a pretence of trade with the next two vessels he robbed. Soon afterward, Bonnet quit the charade of trading and reverted to naked piracy. In July 1718, he cruised north to Delaware Bay, pillaging another eleven vessels. He took several prisoners, some of whom joined his pirate crew. While Bonnet set loose most of his prizes after looting them, he retained control {{of the last two}} ships he captured: the sloops Francis and Fortune. On 1August 1718, the Royal James and the two captured sloops sailed southward from Delaware Bay. The captured sloops lagged behind, and Bonnet threatened to sink them if they did not stay closer. During the passage, Bonnet and his crew divided their loot into shares of about £10 or £11 and distributed them <b>amongst</b> <b>themselves.</b> This is the only time Bonnet is known to have practised this important pirate custom, and it suggests he had by then abandoned his unorthodox practice of paying regular wages to his crew.|$|E
5|$|By 1905 the {{previously}} fragmented Buginese and Torajan lands had united into four major areas, {{one of which}} was under Tiku. In July of that year the king of Gowa, a nearby state, began collecting soldiers to fight off the invaders and prevent the remainder of the Torajan lands from conquest. Ma'dika Bombing, a leader from a southern state, approached Tiku for his assistance. A month after the messengers had dispersed, the leaders gathered at Gowa to make a plan of action. The result was that the local lords were to stop warring <b>amongst</b> <b>themselves</b> and focus on the Dutch, who had superior strength; these internal conflicts, however, did not completely abate. By the time the meeting adjourned, the Dutch had already begun making advances on Luwu. Tiku, tasked with diverting the Dutch from the indefensible town of Rantepo, began to build his army and work on his defences.|$|E
50|$|When the French Revolution {{broke out}} in 1789, debates started in the British Isles on how to respond. Soon a pro-Revolutionary republican and anti-Revolutionary monarchist camp had {{established}} <b>themselves</b> <b>amongst</b> the intelligentsia, who waged a pamphlet war until 1795. Prominent figures of the republican camp were Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin and again Thomas Paine.|$|R
5000|$|Love <b>Amongst</b> Ruin {{describe}} <b>themselves</b> as [...] "a multi-faceted {{rock band}} that promises {{the crunch of}} a stone age queen, the crossover appeal of a parkful of linkins and the melodicism of the hardiest fighter of foos". They also cite having New Order, Depeche Mode, Kasabian, Can, The Cure and Metallica elements to their sound.|$|R
50|$|Now {{back in the}} First Division for {{the first}} time since the 1922-23 season Stoke were looking to {{establish}} <b>themselves</b> <b>amongst</b> the nation's elite. However, they struggled and by Christmas they were in the relegation places, but only three defeats in their last twelve matches saw Stoke survive comfortably and finished the season in 12th place with 41 points.|$|R
