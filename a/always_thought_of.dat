5|$|What {{followed}} {{was the first}} of three consecutive controversial and painful Game 7s in which Chamberlain played. In that Game 7, the Sixers could not get their act together: 15,202 stunned Philadelphia fans witnessed a historic 100–96 defeat, making it the first time in NBA history a team lost a series after leading three games to one. Although Cherry points out that the Sixers shot badly (Hal Greer, Wali Jones, Chet Walker, Luke Jackson and Matt Guokas hit a combined 25 of 74 shots) and Chamberlain grabbed 34 rebounds and shot 4-of-9, the center himself scored only 14 points. In the second half of Game 7, Chamberlain did not attempt a single shot from the field. Cherry observes a strange pattern in that game: in a typical Sixers game, Chamberlain got the ball 60 times in the low post, but only 23 times in Game 7, and only seven times in the third and only twice in the fourth quarter. Chamberlain later blamed coach Hannum for the lack of touches, a point which the coach conceded himself, but Cherry points out that Chamberlain, who <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> himself as the best player of all time, should have been outspoken enough to demand the ball himself. The loss meant that Chamberlain was now 1–6 in playoff series against the Celtics.|$|E

25|$|The Pacer {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the formerly unloved cars from the 1970s that are enjoying a resurgence in both collectibility and auto restoration—especially among fans of cars from that era. The Pacer is one of several 1970s cars that were <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as cheap vehicles; therefore they were poorly maintained, which reduced their life expectancy. Also the heavy engines used in the car put more load on the front suspension than intended, which caused the rack & pinion steering to fail frequently on Pacers built in 1975.|$|E
25|$|I {{regret to}} say {{that none of us}} {{approved}} of the marriage at that time. Mother thought Jack was too young, and Lottie and I felt that Olive, being in musical comedy, belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world at her feet. She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which was not at all surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had the loveliest violet-blue eyes I have ever seen. They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent pallor of her skin. I could understand why Florenz Ziegfeld never forgave Jack for taking her away from the Follies. She and Jack were madly in love with one another but I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> them as a couple of children playing together.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of the final day, Kawada, aware of the collars' {{internal}} microphones, seemingly kills Shuya and Noriko. Suspicious, Kitano ends the game and dismisses the troops, intent on personally killing the supposed victor. Kitano realizes that Kawada had hacked into the game's system months beforehand, and has now disabled Shuya and Noriko's tracking devices. The three survivors confront Kitano in the headquarters, and he unveils a disturbing homemade painting of the massacred class that depicts Noriko as sole survivor. He reveals that he was unable to bear the hatred between him and his students, having been rejected by his daughter. He confesses that he <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Noriko as a daughter and asks her to kill him, but Shuya shoots Kitano after he threatens Noriko with a gun. As he falls, Kitano shoots, revealing the gun to be a water pistol. Before he dies, Kitano's daughter calls him, and after a brief argument, he shoots the phone with an actual gun.|$|E

According to González Echevarría, the book is at once an [...] "essay, biography, autobiography, novel, epic, memoir, confession, political pamphlet, diatribe, scientific treatise, [...] travelogue". Sarmiento's style and his exploration of the life of Facundo unify the three distinct parts of his work. Even the first section, describing Argentina's geography, follows this pattern, since Sarmiento contends that Facundo is a natural product of this environment.|$|E

Born John Simon Ritchie, later known as John Beverley, Vicious was previously drummer of two inner circle punk bands, Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Flowers of Romance. He was also credited with introducing the pogo dance to the scene at the 100 Club. John Robb claims it was at the first Sex Pistols residency gig, 11 May 1976; Matlock is convinced it happened during the second night of the 100 Club Punk Special in September, when the Pistols were off playing in Wales. In Matlock's description, Rotten wanted Vicious in the band because [...] "nstead of him against Steve and Paul, it would become him and Sid against Steve and Paul.

500|$|Sivaji Ganesan {{was cast}} as the male lead. Both the female leads– B. Saroja Devi and Sowcar Janaki– were cast in roles {{different}} from what they were earlier proposed for. According to Ganesan's eldest son Ramkumar, [...] "Sivaji <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Sowcar Janaki as classy and sophisticated," [...] which was why he cast her as a [...] "modern woman" [...] in Puthiya Paravai. [...] "Before that Sowcar had only acted in homely roles". Mirasi, who made a cameo appearance as the hero's father in the film, was initially not convinced about Janaki acting in the film. But after seeing her performance in the song [...] "Paartha Gnaabagam Illaiyo", Mirasi decided to include her {{for the rest of the}} film. Janaki added her own subtle distinctions and inputs to her role as portraying an out-and-out seductive vamp, according to her, would have felt deplorable. Nagesh, S. V. Ramadoss, V. K. Ramasamy, M. R. Radha, O. A. K. Thevar and Manorama were cast in supporting roles.|$|E
500|$|Having {{represented}} Wales at schoolboy level, Keenor {{was invited}} to attend a trial at Cardiff City by his former school teacher Riden, who had spotted Keenor playing local amateur football for Cardiff based side Roath Wednesday.

The Cardiff City amateur side competed in the Western Football League at the time and Keenor appeared several times in the division. A defeat to Camerton during a Western League fixture would leave a lasting effect on Keenor after an over-confident Cardiff side suffered an upset, losing 3–1 in a match they were widely expected to win. Keenor often spoke of using the defeat as motivation in later stages of his career, remarking [...] "In subsequent seasons I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that game when {{we were supposed to be}} on a [...] "good thing".

500|$|The name Kaali means Kaala {{or force}} of time. When there were neither the creation, nor the sun, the moon, the planets, and the earth, {{there was only}} {{darkness}} and everything was created from the darkness. The Dark appearance of Kaali represents the darkness from which everything was born. Her complexion is deep blue, like the sky and ocean water as blue. As she is also the goddess of Preservation, Kaali is worshiped as the preserver of nature. Kaali is standing calm on Shiva ,her appearance represents the preservation of mother nature. Her free, long and black hair represents nature's freedom from civilization. Under the third eye of kali, the signs of both sun, moon and fire are visible which represent the driving forces of nature.Kaali is not <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as a Dark Goddess.

500|$|While Johnny Depp was Burton's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Ichabod Crane, Paramount {{required}} him to consider Brad Pitt, Liam Neeson and Daniel Day-Lewis. Depp was cast in July 1998 for his third collaboration with Burton. The actor wanted Ichabod to parallel Irving's description of the character in the short story. This included a long prosthetic snipe nose, huge ears, and elongated fingers. Paramount turned down his suggestions, and after Depp read Tom Stoppard's rewrite of the script, he was inspired to take the character even further. [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl," [...] Depp explained. He did not wish to portray the character as a typical action star would have, and instead took inspiration by Angela Lansbury's performance in Death on the Nile. [...] "It's good," [...] Burton reasoned, [...] "because I'm not the greatest action director in the world, and he's not the greatest action star." [...] Depp modeled Ichabod's detective personality from Basil Rathbone in the 1939 Sherlock Holmes film series. He also studied Roddy McDowall's acting for additional influence. Burton added that [...] "the idea was to try to find an elegance in action of the kind that Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing or Vincent Price had." [...] Christina Ricci, who worked with producer Scott Rudin on The Addams Family, was cast as Katrina Van Tassel. Sleepy Hollow also reunited Burton with Jeffrey Jones (from Beetlejuice and Ed Wood) as Reverend Steenwyck, Christopher Walken (Max Schreck in Batman Returns) as the Hessian Horseman, Martin Landau (Ed Wood) in a cameo role, and Hammer veteran Michael Gough (Alfred in Burton's Batman films), whom Burton tempted out of retirement. The Hammer influence was further confirmed by the casting of Christopher Lee in a small role as the Burgomaster who sends Crane to Sleepy Hollow.|$|E
