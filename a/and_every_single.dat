While Eugène crushed Gyulai's command on 17 May, Seras bombarded the Predil fort without effect. Engineer Captain Johann Hermann von Hermannsdorf commanded the garrison of two companies of the 1st battalion of the Szluiner Grenz Infantry Regiment Nr. 3. In order to bring his artillery, cavalry, and wagon trains to Tarvis, Eugène needed to use Predil Pass. He sent three battalions south to attack Hermann's bastion from the pass while Seras drove in from the other side. The French assault began on 18 May and met with tremendous resistance.

500|$|Mof Gimmers of TV Scoop named Spooks series seven as {{the best}} {{television}} show of 2008 out of 50 programmes. Gimmers felt the seventh series performed better than the previous, as it [...] "lost its way slightly" [...] with the concentration of Islamic extremists. The seventh series however, was praised for bringing back the more traditional enemy, the Russians. With the introduction of Lucas North, Gimmers stated [...] "the possibilities for double-blinding the audience were legion <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> one was exploited to the max." [...] Gimmers also cited the more [...] "pacy" [...] plots due to a shorter series as another factor of the series's success, and also said [...] "the only problem with having a series as good as this in the bag is how they will match it next year?" [...] David Blackwell of Enterline Media said that the series' storylines [...] "have a grain of truth reflecting today's climate" [...] and also [...] "more deeply rooted in gritty realism and preying on the real dangers that terrorists and other countries pose to the UK." [...] Blackwell also posed the storylines also [...] "keeps the characters human and show what they go through" [...] and reacted positevely towards Lucas' introduction, stating [...] "I like Lucas North better than Adam Carter or Tom Quinn. His dark and conflicted persona adds to the story and makes him a more interesting character than Adam or Tom ever were." [...] Blackwell summed up the series as [...] "as great as the first six seasons. The show maintains a high standard of quality." ...|$|E

He {{was eager to}} land the role, feeling that he related to the character extremely well. In preparation for filming, he had to bleach his hair and gain 15 pounds. Lawrence, a close friend, has always spoken highly of him as an actor; in regards to his portrayal of Peeta Mellark she stated, [...] "He's charming, he's sweet, he's down to earth, he's normal. He embodies all of it and brings it all to Peeta ... he's got all those great qualities <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> one of them comes across in every line he says out loud as Peeta." [...] He became known for his pranks on set, leading to an accident as he was play-fighting with Lawrence who {{kicked him in the}} head, unintentionally knocking him unconscious and giving him a concussion.

2500|$|The party {{entered into}} a {{temporary}} merger with the Democratic Labor Party, standing on a centrist platform as the [...] "National Alliance" [...] in both the March 1974 state election and the May 1974 federal election.

However, in both elections the party lost votes and seats compared to the combined performance of its component parties in previous elections, losing its last seats in the federal House of Representatives and one of two Senators. The National Alliance was dissolved soon afterwards and the now-renamed National Country Party reverted to its traditional approach of contesting just rural seats afterwards. In the 1977 federal election the party's last Senator, Tom Drake-Brockman, retired and his seat was lost. The party would not win another federal seat until the 2010 federal election.|$|E
2500|$|Older was {{particularly}} notable {{for the release}} of its six singles. Each of them reached the UK Top 3, a record for the most singles in the British Top 3 released from a single album.

The Older album has now proved itself to be far and away his most commercially successful recording ever. Five singles now lifted <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> one has been a Top 3 hit. Compare this with the two Top 3 hits produced by Faith and Listen Without Prejudice's scant total of one Top Tenner and one single which missed the Top 40 altogether. This sustained single success has been achieved {{with a little help from}} marketing tricks such as remixes– or in this case a new recording of the album track which gives it a much-needed transformation into a deserved commercial smash." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Morpurgo, {{the author}} of the book on which the film is based, visited the set several times while filming was being undertaken: [...] "Spielberg’s a {{wonderful}} storyteller and a kid.

When I went to visit him on set, he was clearly enthralled by the countryside. He fell for Devon in a big way. He was warm, kind and open, and utterly without ego ... Spielberg was like a conductor with a very light baton. He hardly had to wave it at all. I was in awe.” Emily Watson also praised Spielberg's approach: [...] "It was intimate, passionate and about the acting. <b>And</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> priority that as an actor that you would want to be there was there. It felt very real and focused." [...] On set, he'd come in, in the morning, and say, 'I couldn't sleep last night. I was worrying about this shot!' Which was great! He's human and he's still working in an impassioned way, like a 21-year-old, trying to make the best out of everything." ...|$|E
