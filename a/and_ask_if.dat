They knock on a neighbor's door or ring the doorbell; when the neighbor comes out they greet him, <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> they are allowed to sing. If the answer is affirmative, they sing a children's ditty or the Troparion of the Nativity. As a reward, the neighbor gives them candies or even money; more traditional gifts include walnuts, prunes, apples, and cakes. Not only can Serbian children be korinđaši, but also Romanian and Hungarian ones.|$|E

500|$|Xhinovci {{has come}} to believe that he is Hitler reincarnated since he began {{dressing}} as the Nazi leader. He carries numerous pieces of Nazi paraphernalia around with him, including Nazi-era Reichsmarks, swastika-emblazoned buttons, scarves embroidered with swastikas and other Nazi imagery, as well as a copy of Mein Kampf. He has business cards featuring a swastika and the word [...] "Hitler" [...] printed in bold. Locals and peacekeepers alike do not seem to mind Xhinovci's Hitler impersonations, especially as many Kosovars are too preoccupied with the country's crippling poverty and rampant corruption to give his actions much thought. On the contrary, many passersby—including some NATO peacekeepers—stop and greet him with the Nazi salute. One local told Vice News: [...] "I have {{a lot of other things}} to worry about in my life. I might look at him if he walks by, but that's it." [...] Locals apparently believe that his way of earning a living [...] "shows great enterprise". [...] "People respect me," [...] Xhinovci explains. [...] "The young and old [...] men, women and children. Everyone greets me with [...] "Heil Hitler". Xhinovci's five daughters, referred to locally as [...] "Hitler's children", are not bothered by their father's Hitler impersonations. Xhinovci reportedly attends parent-teacher conferences dressed as Hitler and says that teachers and other parents do not mind his appearance. He says that every time he goes to pick his daughters up from school he is surrounded by children who want to talk with him and take pictures. [...] "Girls like to touch my face. They think it's a mask. They pull my hair <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> they can kiss me on the face. When I'm out of the house with my family, people stop to talk to me. But my wife is not a jealous person—she doesn't mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former admissions {{director}} Michele Hernandez agreed, {{and suggested}} that the best essay topics were a slice-of-life story, with poignant details, in which the writer shows and does not tell. She suggested that a student show their essay to a literate friend <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> would they admit this person to the college. She recommended that applicants not try to come across as a [...] "preppy well-off kid" [...] but downplay parental status. Advisors Mamlet and VanDeVelde suggest that students proactively try to explain an unusual grade, such as a low grade in a core course. There are online databases available to help students write cogent essays.|$|E
2500|$|Agnes, an upper-class {{woman in}} her late 50s, {{discusses}} the possibility of losing her mind.

[...] Claire appears and apologizes to Agnes that her own nature is such to bring out in her sister {{the full force of}} her brutality. Claire senses that Tobias and Agnes’s daughter Julia might be going on her fourth divorce and predicts that Julia will be coming home shortly. [...] Agnes reenters, announcing that Julia is coming home. Tobias then {{tells the story of a}} cat that he once had. There is a knock on the door. Harry and Edna, Agnes and Tobias’s best friends, arrive <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> they can stay there. They have been frightened by something intangible.|$|E

2500|$|The unknown killer did not {{acquire a}} {{nickname}} {{until after the}} death of Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin. In the April 16 edition of the Texarkana Daily News, a heading read, [...] "Phantom Killer Eludes Officers as Investigation of Slayings Pressed". The story from the front page continued on page two with the title, [...] "Phantom Slayer Eludes Police". The Texarkana Gazette contained a small title on April 17 which read, [...] "Phantom Slayer Still at Large as Probe Continues". J.Q. Mahaffey, executive editor of the Texarkana Gazette in 1946, said that Calvin Sutton, the managing editor of the Gazette, had an acute sense for the dramatic in the news, which impelled him to turn to him <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> they could not start referring to the unknown murderer as [...] "The Phantom". Mahaffey replied, [...] "Why not? If the SOB continues to elude capture, he certainly can be called a phantom!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Pete's catchphrase was [...] "alright treacle?" [...] {{pronounced}} [...] "awight treacle", {{often used}} when addressing female characters. Peter Dean has discussed why the catchphrase came into existence: [...] "I had this saying - treacle. There was this long scene with Den and his mistress and I {{had to ask}} her for a drink, but I completely forgot her name, so said 'Give us a drink, treacle'. And after the episode came out, the actress said her children kept calling her treacle! A couple of scriptwriters wanted to stop it - they didn't want any catchphrases. But one lovely writer put it in so I could say {{it was in the}} script! And it stuck. Poor people couldn't afford sugar so put treacle in their tea. And it just means someone sweet and nice. I always said it and my granddad said it. Even now {{people come up to me}} <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> I'll say 'awight treacle' down their mobile phone to someone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, Indigenous {{feminism}} is set {{apart from other}} Indigenous rights movements, such as Indigenous liberation theory, because those theories have [...] "not been attentive to the gendered ways in which colonial oppression and racism function for men and women, or to the inherent and adopted sexisms that some communities manifest." [...] There are some within Indigenous communities who choose not to identify as feminist and therefore {{distance themselves from the}} mainstream feminism. There are many reasons for this choice, however, Kim Anderson argues that ifWestern {{feminism is}} unpalatable because it is about rights rather than responsibilities, then we should all take responsibility seriously <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> we are being responsible to all members of our societies. If we are to reject equality in favour of difference, then {{we need to make sure}} those differences are embedded in systems that empower all members. If we see feminism as being too invested in Western liberalism and individual autonomy, then we need to ensure that our collectivist approaches serve everyone in the collective. And if we want to embrace essential elements of womanhood that have been problematic for Western feminists [...] then we have to ensure that these concepts don't get stuck in literal or patriarchal interpretations.|$|E

2500|$|The Scotiabank Saddledome {{was one of}} many {{buildings}} impacted by the 2013 Alberta floods. [...] The flooding of the Elbow and Bow Rivers swamped many areas of the city, including Stampede Park where the Saddledome is located. [...] The event level of the arena was reported to be filled with water up to the 10th row of seating and the dressing rooms and control room for the video replay screen were under water. At a press conference held on June 22, 2013, team president Ken King stated that the arena had flooded up to the eighth row and that the event level of the facility was a [...] "total loss." [...] He added that the team's equipment and some memorabilia had also been destroyed, but expressed confidence that the facility would be repaired and ready in time for the October start to the season. Prospect Ben Hanowski was among the 100,000 people forced to evacuate by the floods. He described the situation as [...] "almost terrifying," [...] but praised the city's community spirit in the disaster: [...] "I didn’t know how I was going to get [...] I didn’t know if I could get a rental car out of the garage and through some water to get up here, and I had a person come up to me right away <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> I had a place to go and if I had a way to get there and basically offered me a ride somewhere. I’d never met the person before. I think that example, right there, kind of speaks to what the city of Calgary is all about." ...|$|E
