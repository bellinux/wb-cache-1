5|$|Another novel {{aspect of}} the {{offensive}} used by the attackers, which was extensively commented upon by American journalist Timothy Turner who was observing the battle from El Paso, was the rotation of troops that the rebels employed. Rather than attacking en masse with the whole army, Villa and Orozco had their soldiers engage the enemy for a few hours, {{then go back to}} secure positions to sleep, while other rebels took their place. As a consequence the rebel troops were always rested while the less numerous defending federal troops were forced to remain sleepless <b>and</b> <b>ever</b> vigilant.|$|E

5|$|The {{effect of}} the {{resistance}} was to topple Somerset as Lord Protector, so that in 1549 it was feared by some that the Reformation would cease. The prayer book was the tipping point.

5|$|An ugly reef is this of the Dhu Heartach; no {{pleasant}} {{assemblage of}} shelves, and pools, and creeks, about which a child might {{play for a}} whole summer without weariness, like the Bell Rock or the Skerryvore, but one oval nodule of black-trap, sparsely bedabbled with an inconspicuous fucus, and alive in every crevice with a dingy insect between a slater and a bug. No other life was there but of sea-birds, and of the sea itself, that here ran like a mill-race, and growled about the outer reef for ever, <b>and</b> <b>ever</b> and again, in the calmest weather, roared and spouted on the rock itself.|$|E
