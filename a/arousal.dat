5|$|Homosexual <b>arousal</b> in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while homosexual activities and <b>arousal</b> during adolescence {{had a very}} strong connection with adult homosexuality. Rape and sexual molestation {{did not appear to be}} significant in the development of homosexuality. Heterosexual <b>arousal</b> during childhood had a very small effect on adult sexual preference. Homosexual women were more likely to have their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, did not appear to play a significant role in the development of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult homosexuality.|$|E

40|$|Confusional <b>arousals,</b> {{or sleep}} drunkenness, occur upon {{awakening}} and remain un {{studied in the}} general population. We selected a representative sample from the United Kingdom. Germany, and Italy (N = 13, 0. 57) and conducted telephone interviews. Confusional <b>arousals</b> were reported by 2. 9 % of the sample: 1 % (95 % confidence interval:. 8 to 1. 2 %) of the sample also presented with memory deficits (53. 9 %), disorientation in time and/or space (71 %), or slow mentation and speech (54. 4 %), and 1. 9 % (1. 7 % to 2. 1 %) reported confusional <b>arousals</b> without associated features. Younger subjects (< 35 years) and shift or night workers were at higher risk of reporting confusional <b>arousals.</b> These <b>arousals</b> were strongly associated {{with the presence of}} a mental disorder with odds ratios ranging from 2. 4 to 13. 5. Bipolar and anxiety disorders were the most frequently associated mental disorders. Furthermore, subjects with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, violent or injurious behaviors, insomnia, and hypersomnia are more likely to suffer from confusional <b>arousals.</b> Confusional <b>arousals</b> appears to occur quite frequently in the general population, affecting mostly younger subjects regardless of their gender. Physicians {{should be aware of the}} frequent associations between confusional <b>arousals,</b> mental disorders, and OSAS.

However, few have made definitive assessments of potential associations between the overall level of sound (sound intensity) or sound peaks, and sleep <b>arousals.</b> This is principally because there are a large number of sound peaks in the environment and ICU patients experience many sleep <b>arousals.</b>|$|R
5|$|More global {{behavioural}} abnormalities may be noted, {{such as an}} increase in <b>arousal</b> and movement (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or delirium. An inability to sit still might represent akathisia, {{a side effect of}} antipsychotic medication. Similarly, a global decrease in <b>arousal</b> and movement (described as psychomotor retardation, akinesia or stupor) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or delirium. The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that the patient is experiencing hallucinations), and the quality of eye contact (which can provide clues to the patient's emotional state). Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism.|$|E

40|$|In {{disorders}} such as sleep apnea, {{sleep is}} fragmented with frequent EEG-arousal (EEGA) as determined via changes in the sleep-electroencephalogram. EEGA is a poorly understood, complicated phenomenon which is critically important in studying the mysteries of sleep. In this paper we study the information flow between {{the left and right}} hemispheres of the brain during the EEGA as manifested through inter-hemispheric asynchrony (IHA) of the surface EEG. EEG data (using electrodes A 1 /C 4 and A 2 /C 3 of international 10 - 20 system) was collected from 5 subjects undergoing routine polysomnography (PSG). Spectral correlation coefficient (R) was computed between EEG data from two hemispheres for delta-delta(0. 5 - 4 Hz), theta-thetas(4. 1 - 8 Hz), alpha-alpha(8. 1 - 12 Hz) & beta-beta(12. 1 - 25 Hz) frequency bands, during EEGA events. EEGA were graded in 3 levels as (i) micro <b>arousals</b> (3 - 6 s), (ii) short <b>arousals</b> (6. 1 - 10 s), & (iii) long <b>arousals</b> (10. 1 - 15 s). Our results revealed that in beta band, IHA increases above the baseline after the onset of EEGA and returns to the baseline after the conclusion of event. Results indicated that the duration of EEGA events has a direct influence on the onset of IHA. The latency (L) between the onset of <b>arousals</b> and IHA were found to be L= 2 plusmn 0. 5 s (for micro <b>arousals),</b> 4 plusmn 2. 2 s (short <b>arousals)</b> and 6. 5 plusmn 3. 6 s (long <b>arousals...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Breathing {{disturbances}} during snoring {{have been}} quantified by face mask pneumotachography and oesophageal catheters. In order to nonobtrusively investigate respiratory mechanics during nonapnoeic snoring {{in relation to}} sleep disturbances, we employed calibrated respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP). In 10 snorers, RIP recordings were studied during nonapnoeic snoring without <b>arousals</b> in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, nonapnoeic snoring with repe-titive <b>arousals</b> in NREM sleep and wakefulness. Results were compared to RIP recordings in undisturbed NREM sleep and wakefulness in seven healthy non-snorers. Compared to wakefulness and undisturbed NREM sleep in nonsnorers, snoring was associated with predominant thoracic breathing, ribcage/abdominal asynchrony, and increased fractional inspiratory time. Preceding <b>arousals</b> during snoring, inspi-ratory flattening of time-derivatives of RIP volume signals, and marked ribcage/abdom-inal asynchrony indicated pronounced flow limitation. Low variation coefficients of respiratory cycle time (< 10 %) and tidal volume (< 20 %) discriminated snoring periods without <b>arousals</b> from snoring periods with <b>arousals</b> and from wakeful-ness periods, with a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 99 %. Snoring periods with <b>arousals</b> were identified {{by the presence of}} snoring combined with high coef-ficients of variation of cycle time (≥ 10 %) and tidal volume (≥ 20 %), with a sensi-tivity of 96 % and a specificity of 100 %. Thus, characteristic patterns of ribcage/abdominal motion recorded by respira-tory inductive plethysmography differentiated breathing in sleep disruptive snor-ing from simple snoring...|$|R
50|$|Larger mammals (e.g. ground squirrels) and bats show multi-day torpor bouts during {{hibernation}} (up {{to several}} weeks) in winter. During these multi-day torpor bouts, body temperature drops to ~1 °C above ambient temperature and metabolism may drop to about 1% {{of the normal}} endothemic metabolic rate. Even in these deep hibernators, the long periods of torpor is interrupted by bouts of endothermic metabolism, called <b>arousals</b> (typically lasting between 4-20 hours). These metabolic <b>arousals</b> cause body temperature to return to euthermic levels 35-37 °C. Most of the energy spent during hibernation is spent in <b>arousals</b> (70-80%), but their function remains unresolved.|$|R
5|$|Tertiary sexual {{dysfunction}} results from {{psychological and social}} factors. Reduced libido, desire, or experience of <b>arousal</b> {{could be due to}} psychological or situational factors such as depression, anxiety, and changes in relationships. Both sexes experience reduced sexual desire after SCI, and almost half of men and almost three quarters of women have trouble becoming psychologically aroused. Depression is {{the most common cause of}} problems with <b>arousal</b> in people with SCI. People frequently experience grief and despair initially after the injury. Anxiety and drug and alcohol abuse may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can exacerbate sexual difficulties. Drug and alcohol abuse increase unhealthy behaviors, straining relationships and social functioning.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual men {{tended to}} have had their first {{homosexual}} encounter at a younger age, {{and were more likely}} to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data did not support the idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual <b>arousal</b> during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual <b>arousal</b> during childhood was a moderate predictor of adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, did not seem to be important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did not seem to be an important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior as an indicator of adult sexual preference.|$|E

50|$|Other {{medications}} {{aimed at}} reducing or eliminating the leg jerks or the <b>arousals</b> can be prescribed. Non-ergot derived dopaminergic drugs (pramipexole and ropinirole) are preferred. Other dopaminergic agents such as co-careldopa, co-beneldopa, pergolide, or lisuride may also be used.

40|$|Estimating {{the degree}} of sleep {{fragmentation}} {{is an important part}} of a respiratory sleep study and is conventionally measured using EEG micro <b>arousals</b> or is inferred indirectly from respiratory abnormalities such as apnoeas and desaturations. There is a need for less labour-intensive measures of sleep fragmentation, and transient rises in blood pressure and heart rate may fulfil this role. Forty unselected sleep clinic referrals undergoing investigation for possible obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) were studied with one night of polysomnography. Three conventional indices of sleep fragmentation (EEG micro <b>arousals,</b> apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) and oxygen saturation dip rate (SaO 2 dips)) and two autonomic indices (heart rate and blood pressure rises) have been compared. Correlations between these five indices ranged from r= 0. 38 to r= 0. 73. Of the two autonomic indices, the correlations for blood pressure rises with SaO 2 dips and EEG micro <b>arousals</b> were stronger (r= 0. 71 and r= 0. 65, respectively) than those for heart rate rises (0. 55 and 0. 51). All indices of sleep fragmentation, apart from heart rate rises, were similar in their correlation with subjective sleepiness (r-values 0. 21 - 0. 36). <b>Arousals</b> implied from blood pressure rises (using pulse transit time) can be measured easily, are objective, and appear no worse at predicting subjective sleepiness than either EEG micro <b>arousals</b> or AHI. They may therefore provide a useful alternative to manual scoring of micro <b>arousals</b> from the EEG as an index of sleep fragmentation in sleep clinic patients undergoing investigation for possible OSA...|$|R
5|$|Most {{people with}} SCI have {{problems}} with the body's physical sexual <b>arousal</b> response.

5|$|Among whites, gender nonconformity {{appeared}} {{to be important in}} the development of homosexuality among masculine homosexual women, but not among homosexual women who were not masculine, while adolescent homosexual involvement was important for non-masculine homosexual women but not masculine homosexual women.

40|$|Objective: Previous {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} {{a link between}} restricted sleep and risk indicators for cardiovascular and metabolic disease, such as levels of cortisol, lipids, and glucose. The present study sought to identify relations between polysomnographic measures of disturbed sleep (frequency of <b>arousals</b> from sleep, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency) {{and a number of}} such indicators. A second purpose was to relate the number of <b>arousals</b> to mood, stress, work characteristics, and other possible predictors in daily life. Methods: Twenty-four people (10 men, 14 women; mean age 30 years), high vs. low on burnout, were recruited from a Swedish IT company. Polysomnographically recorded sleep was measured at home before a workday. Blood pressure, heart rate, morning blood sample, and saliva samples of cortisol were measured the subsequent working day. They were also recorded for diary ratings of sleep and stress, and a questionnaire with ratings of sleep, stress, work conditions, and mood was completed. Results: A stepwise regression analysis using sleep parameters as predictors brought out number of <b>arousals</b> as the best predictor of morning cortisol (serum and saliva), heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) -cholesterol, and LDL/HDL-ratio. Work stress/unclear boundaries between work and leisure time was the best predictor of <b>arousals</b> among the stress variables. Conclusion: Consistent with sleep restriction experiments, sleep fragmentation was associated with elevated levels of metabolic and cardiovascular risk indicators of stress-related disorders. Number of <b>arousals</b> also seems to be related to workload/stress. Key words: sleep <b>arousals,</b> polysomnography, metabolic, cortisol, stress, burnout.

5|$|Compared {{with the}} options {{available}} for treating sexual dysfunction in men (for whom results are concretely observable), those available for women are limited. For example, PDE5 inhibitors, oral medications for treating erectile dysfunction in men, {{have been tested}} {{for their ability to}} increase sexual responses such as <b>arousal</b> and orgasm in women—but no controlled trials have been done in women with SCI, and trials in other women yielded only inconclusive results. In theory, women's sexual response could be improved using a vacuum device made to draw blood into the clitoris, but few studies on treatments for sexual function in women with SCI have been carried out.

5|$|During sexual <b>arousal,</b> the {{clitoris}} and {{the whole}} of the genitalia engorge and change color as the erectile tissues fill with blood (vasocongestion), and the individual experiences vaginal contractions. The ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles, which insert into the corpora cavernosa, contract and compress the dorsal vein of the clitoris (the only vein that drains the blood from the spaces in the corpora cavernosa) and the arterial blood continues a steady flow and, having no way to drain out, fills the venous spaces until they become turgid and engorged with blood.

40|$|Objective: To {{define a}} unified method for the {{automatic}} recognition and quantitative description of EEG phasic events of sleep microstructure occurring during NREM sleep, particularly <b>arousals,</b> phase A subtypes of cyclic alternating pattern and spindles. Methods: The NREM sleep EEG of 10 normal young subjects was examined {{in order to}} recognize formal phasic events of sleep microstructure. The following 'formal' events (i. e. events defined exclusively {{on the basis of}} automatic analysis criteria) were classified: <b>arousals,</b> A 1 -phases (A-phases not including <b>arousals)</b> and A 2 - and A 3 -phases (A-phases including <b>arousals).</b> Spindle bursts, corresponding to visually recognized spindles, were also formally defined. The identification of these events was carried out following a three-step procedure: (1) computation of band-related descriptors derived from the EEG signal, (2) introduction of suitable thresholds and (3) application of simple logical principles, i. e. an exclusion principle and an overlapping principle. Results: Formal A-phases, <b>arousals</b> and spindle bursts showed spectral characteristics which were consistent with visual inspection. The value of the parameter Correctness for the recognition of the A-phases was 83. 5 %. In particular, the different physiological distribution of the A-phases in Stage 2 preceding slow wave sleep with respect to Stage 2 preceding REM sleep was confirmed.

40|$|Abstract Body {{temperature}} (Tb) {{of seven}} European hamsters maintained at constant ambient temperature (Ta = 8 ° C) and constant photoperiod (LD 8 : 16) was recorded throughout the hibernating season using in-traperitoneal temperature-sensitive HF transmitters. The animals spent about 30 % of the hibernation season in hypothermia and 70 % in inter-bout normothermy. Three types of hypothermia, namely deep hibernation bouts (DHBs), short hibernation bouts (SHBs), and short and shallow hibernation bouts (SSHBs), were distinguished by differences in bout duration and mini-mal body temperature (Tm). A gradual development of SSHBs from the diel minimum of Tb during normo-thermy {{could be seen}} in individual hamsters, suggesting a stepwise decrease of the homeostatic setpoint of Tb regulation during the early hibernation season. Entry into hibernation followed a 24 -h rhythm occurring at preferred times of the day in all three types of hypo-thermia. DHBs and SHBs were initiated approximately 4 h before SSHBs, indicating a general difference in the physiological initiation of SSHBs {{on the one hand and}} DHBs and SHBs on the other. <b>Arousals</b> from SHBs and SSHBs also followed a 24 -h rhythm, whereas sponta-neous <b>arousals</b> from DHBs were widely scattered across day and night. Statistical analyses of bout length and the interval between <b>arousals</b> revealed evidence for a free-running circadian rhythm underlying the timing of <b>arousals.</b> The results clearly demonstrate that entries into hypothermia are linked to the light/dark-cycle.
