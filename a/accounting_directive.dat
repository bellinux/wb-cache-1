That is why the problem that arises more frequently is the harmonization of national legislation with the European legislation.

The study provides evidence from an accounting system {{which is based on}} both EU <b>accounting</b> <b>directives</b> and an "economic-substance-over-legal-form" philosophy throughout the investigated period. Overall, our results do not indicate that the value-relevance of accounting information has decreased over the investigated period (1983 - 2001), which is otherwise implied by some critics of "traditional" financial reporting. Rather, the results indicate that the value-relevance of accounting information is unchanged over the period.

40|$|The {{materiality}} principle {{supports the}} information function of accounting {{in order to}} enhance investors' decisions. Therefore, materiality guides the entity to present relevant information and to prevent information overload. This decision is mostly subjective and is based primarily on the individual's judgement in applying vague legal concepts. This could result in a greater expectation gap between management information and investors' understanding. The EU <b>accounting</b> <b>directive</b> 2013 / 34 /EU standardises materiality to harmonise with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, the German legislator did not change the national accounting rules German Commercial Code (GCC). Moreover, the new EU audit regulation (EU) No 537 / 2014 requires the disclosure of the quantitative level of materiality thresholds in the audit report. Guidelines remain inadequate, although they are intended to provide clearly defined rules and to avoid boilerplate checklists.

Directive 2009 / 49 /EC is not affecting all sizes of private limited liability companies within the European Union, since {{the most important reason}} for implementing it is to give SMEs less administrative burden by lower requirements regarding the information presented in notes attached to the reports. The implementation of Directive 2009 / 49 EC is a positive change since it is in line with the idea of an Internal Market with equal rights and obligations to all sized of limited liability companies, private or public. The lower obligations in the annual reports in the Fourth Directive are for SMEs to the better because of the less administrative burden and the loss of information for interested is not more important, but of course, for some it is crucial. Amending the Seventh Directive may have larger effect to some companies, most likely medium-sized SMEs, since the obligation to draw consolidated accounts will for some companies not be necessary...|$|R

40|$|In 2009 the European Commission {{launched}} the public consultation on {{the review of}} the Accounting Directives as part of the project to modernise and simplify EU accounting rules, which led to the new European <b>Accounting</b> <b>Directive</b> in 2013. This process offers a unique research opportunity to explore the under researched – but extremely relevant – EU accounting standard-setting process, in order to understand constituents’ different orientations on key topics in reporting regulation and the role played by the users’ primacy principle in shaping the new Directive. Results show significant differences in respondents’ views on the choice between mandatory requirements and voluntary disclosure and on differential reporting. Constituents from different geographical contexts do not share the same view on either topic, while users, the accounting profession and preparers express different orientations with regard to mandatory reporting and voluntary disclosure. In the light of these results, the new Directive seems to be inspired by the users’ primacy principle for issues connected to mandatory reporting and voluntary disclosure, in contrast with preparers’ expectations.

In the process of adoption of the 2013 EU <b>Accounting</b> <b>Directive</b> only limited references have been made to IFRS.

The Dutch Accounting Standards Board, issuing Dutch Accounting Standards (DAS), considers IFRS when developing and changing its standards. In addition to the IFRS option DAS often include one or more additional optional treatments that are considered suitable for non-listed companies. The Dutch regulatory authority AFM is also positive towards IFRS and even advocates elimination of non-IFRS options from Dutch GAAP as much as possible.

40|$|In 2013, the Fourth and Seventh Directives were {{replaced}} by a new <b>Accounting</b> <b>Directive</b> – Directive 2013 / 34 /EC. The Directive is the outcome of EU aspirations to ease the business environment of {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} by simplifying the requirements with regard to reporting and mandatory disclosures for that category of enterprises. The entities of the practical sector (public and private limited liability companies, partnerships, general partnerships, etc.) come within the scope of the Directive. The scope of the Directive excludes non-profit legal entities. The provisions of the Directive should, for the first time, be applied with regard to financial statements for reporting years beginning on or after January 1, 2016. Being an EC Member State, the Republic of Bulgaria has to transpose the Directive into the national accounting legislation by July 2015. The emphasis in this article is put on the basic problematic areas which occur in the process of the transposition of the Directive. As the possible solutions are based on established traditions and practices, the authors of this article try to identify the solutions to these problems taking into consideration the requirements imposed by the Directive itself. Four principal prob-lems are defined in the article: should there be a new Accounting Law and what should it include; should the Accounting Law include accounting principles; what groups and categories of enterprises should be differentiated and which accounting basis should be applied by any of them...|$|E
