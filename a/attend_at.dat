5|$|At {{a series}} of {{high-level}} meetings in May, the Big Six first seriously discussed ending the war—but none of them on terms {{that would have been}} acceptable to the Allies. Because anyone openly supporting Japanese surrender risked assassination by zealous army officers, the meetings were closed to anyone except the Big Six, the Emperor, and the Privy Seal—no second- or third-echelon officers could <b>attend.</b> <b>At</b> these meetings, despite the dispatches from Japanese ambassador Satō in Moscow, only Foreign minister Tōgō realized that Roosevelt and Churchill might have already made concessions to Stalin to bring the Soviets into the war against Japan. As a result of these meetings, Tōgō was authorized to approach the Soviet Union, seeking to maintain its neutrality, or (despite the very remote probability) to form an alliance.|$|E
5|$|Odlum {{was born}} on 24 June 1934 in Castries, {{the son of a}} barber. He studied {{economics}} at Bristol University, becoming the first Afro-Caribbean head of the University of Bristol Union before moving to Magdalen College, Oxford in 1959, where he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics {{and was one of the}} few Afro-Caribbean students to <b>attend.</b> <b>At</b> university, Odlum acted, played both football and cricket, and became noted as a successful debater. After graduating from Oxford he returned to St Lucia in 1961, becoming a Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Trade. He moved back to the United Kingdom in 1964 to work as an economist in the Commonwealth Secretariat, leaving 3 years later. Returning to St Lucia again, he became Executive Secretary to the Council of Ministers of the West Indies Associated States.|$|E
5|$|The Mongols {{crossed the}} frozen Danube early in 1242. A Mongol {{detachment}} {{under the command}} of Kadan, a son of Great Khan Ögödei, chased Béla from town to town in Dalmatia. Béla took refugee in the well-fortified Trogir. Before Kadan laid siege to the town in March, news arrived of the Great Khan's death. Batu Khan wanted to <b>attend</b> <b>at</b> the election of Ögödei's successor with sufficient troops and ordered the withdrawal of all Mongol forces. Béla, who was grateful to Trogir, granted it lands near Split, causing a lasting conflict between the two Dalmatian towns.|$|E

5|$|When this {{announcement}} reached the UK, the NUWSS was {{divided on the}} one hand by patriots such as Millicent Fawcett who were devoted to war work and on the other by the signers of the Christmas letter who wished to send peace delegates. However, the majority of the NUWSS were nationalistic more than they were peace-minded. They rejected a resolution favored by internationalists Helen Bright Clark and Margaret Bondfield which would have supported a delegation of women at The Hague. Because of this, women such as Margaret Ashton, Helena Swanwick and Maude Royden resigned from the NUWSS and made plans to <b>attend</b> <b>at</b> The Hague, some 180 women in total. Macmillan was the only internationalist executive of NUWSS who did not resign; she was away performing relief work. Volunteering near The Hague, Macmillan prepared to join the ex-NUWSS members after the group crossed the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|William Rufus {{crossed into}} Normandy {{to take the}} war to Robert in 1094, and when {{progress}} stalled, called upon Henry for assistance. Henry responded, but travelled to London instead of joining the main campaign further east in Normandy, possibly {{at the request of}} the King, who in any event abandoned the campaign and returned to England. Over the next few years, Henry appears to have strengthened his power base in western Normandy, visiting England occasionally to <b>attend</b> <b>at</b> William Rufus's court. In 1095 Pope Urban II called the First Crusade, encouraging knights from across Europe to join. Robert joined the Crusade, borrowing money from William Rufus to do so, and granting the King temporary custody of his part of the Duchy in exchange. The King appeared confident of regaining the remainder of Normandy from Robert, and Henry appeared ever closer to William Rufus, the pair campaigning together in the Norman Vexin between 1097 and 1098.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the epidemiological features {{and patterns of}} initial care for prostate cancer at public and private institutions in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1, 082 physicians affiliated to the Sao Paulo Section of the Brazilian Society of Urology {{were invited to participate}} in this cross-sectional, web-based survey. Between September 2004 and September 2005, participating urologists entered data on demographic, clinical and pathological characteristics of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer in their practice. Data on patients <b>attended</b> <b>at</b> public institutions were analyzed and compared with those patients <b>attended</b> <b>at</b> private practice. RESULTS: One hundred and ten society members contributed with data from 1915 patients, 1026 (53. 6 %) of whom from public institutions. When compared with patients <b>attended</b> <b>at</b> private institutions, those <b>attended</b> <b>at</b> public institutions were older and more likely to be black, had higher serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, had a higher probability of being diagnosed with metastatic disease, but were less likely to undergo prostatectomy (all P < 0. 001). In multivariate analysis, age, biopsy Gleason score, and being <b>attended</b> <b>at</b> a public institution were independently associated with metastatic disease upon diagnosis. The significant predictors of nonsurgical treatment were age, black race, and higher serum levels of PSA. CONCLUSIONS: A statewide registry provides valuable information regarding patient demographics, clinical features, and patterns of care. The {{results of this study suggest}} that significant disparities exist for patients with prostate cancer <b>attended</b> <b>at</b> different health-care systems. The relative contribution of biological versus socioeconomic features remains uncertain...|$|R

25|$|In summer, as Rakovsky's {{government}} briefly {{lost control}} of Ukraine, his policies became hotly contested by partisans of Ukrainian autonomy inside the Party, who held a conference in Homyel (one which Rakovsky did not <b>attend).</b> <b>At</b> the Fourth Congress of the Ukrainian Party (March 1920), the leadership of Rakovsky, Stanislav Kosior, and Dmitry Manuilsky was not reelected.
