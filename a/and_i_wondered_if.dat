500|$|Judith Kirkwood of Orange Coast Magazine {{has stated}} that [...] "The Beverly Hills Hotel is such an icon that my friend, Gretchen, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> it was a mirage when the taxi pulled up in the porte cochere and {{deposited}} us on a red carpet, but {{realized that it was}} [...] "more like a peachy pink dream dusted with gold— and green and white striped accents".|$|E
60|$|Steele's {{face was}} bloodless now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> {{it had to}} do with her scathing scorn or {{something}} that he hid with his hand closing his coat that way.|$|E
60|$|But {{the stain}} upon our family {{was a source}} of unpleasantness to us. I fully {{believed}} my father innocent, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> the time would ever come when his character would be cleared.|$|E
60|$|This is my seventieth birthday, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> you {{all rise}} {{to the size of}} that proposition, realizing all the {{significance}} of that phrase, seventieth birthday.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it wouldn't do to put {{anything}} that wasn't pretty on a neck like that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> you {{would let me}} fix it." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>And,</b> [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am aphoristic <b>and</b> subtle? <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> {{when she}} gets the rice-powder off, Claire isn't a lot more like Milt than she thought?" ...|$|R
60|$|And then, at last, {{the truth}} flashed across me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> I {{should be in}} time. Ours was the first boat, {{and it would be}} unkind of me to spoil the man’s picture, I thought.|$|E
60|$|She was lion-hearted. I {{could not}} help feeling admiration for the {{extraordinary}} woman. Surely she could not sacrifice her children! <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> a man {{would have had the}} courage to give that bold answer to Savello's threats.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} been doing ever since you left Plescow? I inquired after you the other day, when our troops broke up Schlippenbach's force on the Embach. I found you were not among the prisoners, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> you were among the killed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Winston quietly, [...] "I {{have only}} my word to offer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> you will believe me now, but I don't think I ever won five dollars at cards in my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, say, girl, Mrs. Appleby <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are {{thinking}} of renting one of these here bungalonies, like the fellow says, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> we could {{take a look at}} this house, to see how it looks furnished?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{looked so}} {{occupied}} that I was really afraid to disturb you," [...] said the woman. [...] "Shafton is talking Canadian politics with somebody, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> {{you are too}} busy to find a chair for me." ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{turned back}} to sit down once more I heard two men get up from behind a number of packing-cases on the pier, and walk away. I had not noticed them before, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> they had overheard the {{conversation}} which had taken place.|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw they'd got to {{the agrarian}} laws of Caius Gracchus, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> they knew {{anything}} about the agrarian troubles in Ireland. But all they knew about Ireland was that Dublin was on the Liffey. So I wondered if they'd ever heard of General Gordon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{told that}} Commodore Barney keeps his men jumpin' so lively at fightin' that they don't {{have time for}} anythin' else," [...] the lad said slowly, as if {{speaking}} to himself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> he counted that the commodore could raise the price of oysters.|$|E
60|$|At length, a cold hand is laid upon my shoulder, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> awake. The wild faces have {{vanished}} and all is silent now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> {{the whole thing}} has been a dream. My father lifts me into the dog-cart, and we drive home through the chill dawn.|$|R
6000|$|MY DEAR CHARLES, - The {{above is}} my story, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> any light can be thrown on it. I prefer the girl's father dead; and the {{question}} is, How in that case could Lieutenant George Murray get his order to 'apprehend' and his power to 'sell' her in marriage? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{the poet}} {{replied with a}} long breath, [...] "you are right about that dreamy weft of {{leafless}} twigs against the hard, blue sky; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> we quite {{do justice to the}} beauty of winter, of age, we poets, when we are so glad to have the spring come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I know. Gee! if {{you knew}} how I've been {{thinking}} about you all day! I've been wondering if I ought to-- I'm no good; blooming waster, I told myself; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> I had any right {{to try to make}} you care; but-- Oh, you must come, Goldie!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon they won't go foolin' with Clark's boys again," [...] said Polly Ann, {{resuming}} {{a vigorous}} rubbing of the skillet. [...] "Ye was tellin' me about these fine folks ye fetched home." [...] She tossed {{her head in}} the direction of the open door, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> the fine folks were outside.|$|E
60|$|When {{the boat}} {{finally came to}} a {{standstill}} I was nearly suffocated for the want of fresh air, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> I had not been chloroformed when first assaulted. I was hoisted up by several men and placed upon my feet, and then the cords which bound me were cut and the bag was removed.|$|E
5000|$|President Woodrow Wilson {{knew of the}} APL's {{activities}} and had misgivings about their methods. He wrote to Attorney General Gregory expressing his concern: [...] "It would be dangerous to have such an organization operating in the United States, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> there is any {{way in which we}} could stop it?" [...] But he deferred to Gregory's judgment and took no action to curtail the APL.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a heavy}} misfortune, doubtless; and Ellen will grieve as a {{daughter}} should," [...] replied Mrs. Melmoth, speaking with the good sense of which she had a competent share. [...] "But she has never known her father; and her sorrow must arise {{from a sense of}} duty, more than from strong affection. <b>I</b> will go <b>and</b> inform her of her loss. It is late, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> she be still asleep." ...|$|R
5000|$|Regarding Whitaker's {{criticism}} of Carmon's [...] "political background", Carmon responded that: [...] "You continually refer to my supposed [...] "political background" [...] as if I {{had something to}} hide, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am your real target here. As a civil servant and adviser on counter-terrorism to both Yitzhak Shamir and Yitzhak Rabin, prime ministers from opposing camps, my role was not a political appointment. If your complaint is that I am Israeli, then please say so." ...|$|R
60|$|While {{engaged in}} tidying up the office I noticed {{for the first}} time that the door of the safe stood open. This was a most unusual thing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> my uncle had taken {{something}} out and forgotten to close it. He was a very careful man, and if he had it was the first time I had known him to do such a thing.|$|E
6000|$|... "She does, poor soul. I believe I'll go {{over and}} speak to her. I was {{introduced}} to her at Dave's but I haven't called." [...] Carol was slipping across the lawn, a white figure in the dimness, faintly brushing the dewy grass. She was thinking of Erik and {{of the fact that}} her feet were wet, and she was casual in her greeting: [...] "Hello! The doctor <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> you were lonely." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} {{reconcile}} these books {{with the man}} from what I had seen of him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> he could possibly read them. But when I came to make the bed I found, between the blankets, dropped apparently as he had sunk off to sleep, a complete Browning, the Cambridge Edition. It was open at “In a Balcony,” and I noticed, here and there, passages underlined in pencil. Further, letting drop the volume during a lurch of the ship, {{a sheet of paper}} fell out. It was scrawled over with geometrical diagrams and calculations of some sort.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Hodder," [...] {{she cried}} impulsively, [...] "was it {{necessary}} to go so far? and all at once. I am here not only because I am miserable, but I am concerned on your account. You hurt me very much that day you came to me, but you made me your friend. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> you really understand the terrible, bitter feeling you have aroused, the powerful enemies you have made by speaking so--so unreservedly?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They seem to be," [...] replied Thorne. [...] "One of them {{looks like}} the corporal, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> he wanted a word with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We don't want to {{play any}} tricks, Mr. Cole," [...] {{answered}} Jack. [...] "We are in trouble, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> you could help us out." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{this was}} not to be all. I recollected the {{handcuffs}} in his state-room, which he preferred to use on sailors instead of the ancient and clumsy ship irons. So, when we left him, he lay handcuffed hand and foot. For {{the first time in many}} days I breathed freely. I felt strangely light as I came on deck, as though a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I felt, also, that Maud and I had drawn more closely together. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> she, too, felt it, as we walked along the deck side by side to where the stalled foremast hung in the shears.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{how happy}} and gay I was {{in those first}} few days! There was not a thought of the past, not an {{ambition}} or desire of any sort to bother me. Just to live seemed pleasure enough. I enjoyed eating and sleeping; I loved to talk and laugh; I {{was glad to have}} work to occupy me--and that was all! Then things began to happen that puzzled me. The man Hopkins declared he could not trust me because I had once been a thief, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> he could speak truly. I resented the thought that I may once have been a thief, although I wouldn't mind stealing, even now, if I wanted anything and could take it." ...|$|E
60|$|I'd {{thought she}} looked kind of glum, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> she and Micky had had a falling out. I rather {{suspected}} it, for at the Senior Prom, three nights before, she had hardly looked at Micky, but had sat {{in a corner and}} talked to the Old Fellow. He didn't do much talking; he was too shy, and he looked mighty uncomfortable. I thought it kind of mean of Sylvia to torment him so, when she knew he hated to have to talk to girls, but when I saw Micky scowling at the corner, I knew she was doing it to make him jealous. Girls won't stick at anything when they want to provoke a chap; I know it to my cost, for Jennie Price--but {{that has nothing to do}} with this story.|$|E
60|$|He {{was pretty}} mad, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>wonder,</b> <b>if</b> {{that was the}} way he {{understood}} Rectus, for he was just as much a white man as either of us.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{much too}} modest, and I'm {{going to tell}} Vida so, <b>and,</b> uh, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> {{you can give me}} just a teeny bit of your time and show me where the {{magazine}} files are kept?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! that's what thou be'est {{looking forward}} to, Jack, eh? Well there's summat in that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shouldna' <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> we see thee that some day; but we can't all be oversmen." ...|$|R
