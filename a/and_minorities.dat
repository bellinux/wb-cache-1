5|$|Chastain is a feminist, and {{has often}} spoken against the {{discrimination}} faced by women <b>and</b> <b>minorities</b> in Hollywood.

5|$|The six SNA brigades around Mogadishu were as of July 2013 largely {{composed}} of officers from various Hawiye sub-clans, with some Marehan-Darod <b>and</b> <b>minorities</b> {{also present in}} certain units. Of the brigades, five primarily consisted of Abgaal, Murosade and Hawadle soldiers. In February 2013 the 2nd Brigade was {{under the command of}} Brigadier General Abdullahi Osman Agey. The 3rd Brigade over the same period comprised 840 fighters, most of whom belong to the Hawiye-Habar Gidir/Ayr clan. The unit was around 30% to 50% smaller in size than the other five brigades that are garrisoned in the larger Banaadir region. Led by General Mohamed Roble Jimale 'Gobale', it occupied an area outside of Mogadishu and Merka and along the Afgoye corridor. The Monitoring Group reported that many 3rd Brigade fighters had been drawn from around 300-strong militias controlled by Yusuf Mohamed Siyaad 'Indha Adde', a close associate of Jimale and the former Eritrean-backed chief of defence for the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia-Asmara.

Group discrimination against low status <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> subjects is unchanged.

40|$|Government takings {{of private}} land for public {{purposes}} are permitted by the United States Constitution. Recently, more takings have occurred that largely benefit private individuals {{rather than the}} general public. The land taken for private benefit has primarily been that of low-income <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> individuals. Similarly, toxic waste sites are most often placed in low-income <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> neighborhoods. The modern environmental justice movement helps {{to shed light on}} why low-income <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> property owners are targeted in this way. The U. S. Supreme Court should adjust its analysis of both takings cases and environmental justice cases to account for the inability of the victims of these government actions to prove discriminatory intent. Without this adjustment, the blatant disparate impact of these decisions will continue to disproportionately burden low income <b>and</b> <b>minority</b> individuals...|$|R
