5|$|Tropical Cyclone Hyacinthe was the wettest {{tropical}} cyclone on record worldwide. The eighth named storm of the season, Hyacinthe formed on January15, 1980, {{to the northeast}} of Mauritius in the southern Indian Ocean.

On January19, Météo-France estimated that the storm had intensified to a {{tropical cyclone}}. Hyacinthe looped {{to the south of}} eastern Madagascar and weakened, although it restrengthened <b>after</b> <b>turning</b> to the east. The storm executed another loop to the southwest of Réunion, passing near the island for a second and later third time. Hyacinthe became extratropical on January29 <b>after</b> <b>turning</b> southward, dissipating two days later.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Mamie was {{the worst}} {{tropical}} cyclone to affect China in 26years. Originating from an area of disturbed weather near the Philippines in mid-August1985, the system gradually became better organized, and was upgraded into a tropical storm early on August16. It continued to deepen, and late on August17, Mamie attained typhoon intensity. Around this time, Typhoon Mamie reached its peak intensity of , which it maintained for 12hours. After making landfall in Shanghai, the storm steadily weakened.

5|$|A {{very active}} trough of low {{pressure}} persisted along the equator {{in the middle}} of November, with westerly surface winds and windspread convection located along the trough from 140° W to 140° E. An organized circulation developed near Palmyra Atoll on November 18, and steadily developed as it drifted westward. Though very late in the season, warm temperatures to the south of the Hawaiian Islands due to the strongest El Nino in many years allowed the disturbance to develop into Tropical Storm Iwa on November 19 while located about 970miles (1,760km) southwest of the southernmost point in Hawaii. The storm tracked slowly northward after forming and initially remained a weak tropical storm. <b>After</b> <b>turning</b> to the northeast, Iwa began slowly intensifying, and on November 23 <b>after</b> <b>turning</b> to the north-northwest Iwa strengthened into a hurricane while located 580miles (930km) southwest of the southern tip of Hawaii.|$|E
