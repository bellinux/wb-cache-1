5|$|To {{support their}} {{categorization}} of certain films as noirs and their rejection of others, many critics {{refer to a}} set of elements they see as marking examples of the mode. The question of what constitutes the set of noir's identifying characteristics is a fundamental source of controversy. For instance, critics tend to define the model film noir as having a tragic or bleak conclusion, but many acknowledged classics of the genre have clearly happy endings (e.g., Stranger on the Third Floor, The Big Sleep, Dark Passage, and The Dark Corner), while the tone of many other noir denouements is ambivalent. Some critics perceive classic noir's hallmark as a distinctive visual style. Others, observing that there is actually considerable stylistic variety among noirs, instead emphasize plot and character type. Still others focus on mood and attitude. No survey of classic noir's identifying characteristics can therefore be considered definitive. In the 1990s and 2000s, critics have increasingly turned their <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> diverse field of films called neo-noir; once again, there is even less consensus about the defining attributes of such films made outside the classic period.|$|E

25|$|Some had {{speculated that}} Villepin, with his {{diplomatic}} {{experience and the}} prestige associated with the job of Prime Minister, would negotiate a new treaty with the European Union, while Sarkozy would run the country at home. However, Villepin obtained favorable reviews from the press and temporarily increased popularity in polls. In particular, he was increasingly cited as a possible presidential candidate for 2007, although Nicolas Sarkozy had publicly stated that he himself was giving considerable <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> election. Villepin and Sarkozy initially avoided any open division.|$|E
25|$|Emphasis and {{contrast}} may override normal stress. Pronouns frequently take stress because of this. In {{a simple question}} like Ĉu vi vídis? ('Did you see?'), the pronoun hardly {{needs to be said}} and is unstressed; compare Né, dónu al mí and ('No, give me). Within a word, a prefix that wasn't heard correctly may be stressed upon repetition: Né, ne tíen! Iru máldekstren, mi diris! ('No, not over there! Go left, I said!'). Because stress doesn't distinguish words in Esperanto, shifting it to an unexpected syllable calls <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> syllable, but doesn't cause confusion as it might in English.|$|E
25|$|She {{became more}} {{prominent}} as a progressive when she voiced opposition to {{what became the}} 2003 Iraq War, appearing on CNN and Fox News to discuss it. She {{said that she was}} approached by groups such as MoveOn.org and Win Without War to go on TV, because these organizations say that the networks were not allowing antiwar voices to be heard. Garofalo and the other celebrities who appeared at the time said they thought their fame could lend <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> side of the debate. Her appearances on cable news prior to the war garnered her praise from the left and spots on the cover of Ms. and Venus Zine. Garofalo has had frequent on-air political disputes with Bill O'Reilly, Brian Kilmeade, and Jonah Goldberg.|$|E

Astronomers had considered the [...] "law" [...] a meaningless coincidence, but Uranus fell at very nearly the exact distance it predicted. Since Bode's law also predicted a body between Mars and Jupiter that at that point had not been observed, astronomers turned their <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> region in the hope that it might be vindicated again. Finally, in 1801, astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi found a miniature new world, Ceres, lying at just the correct point in space. The object was hailed as a new planet.|$|E

Dahl later explained, [...] "I convinced my parents and the school that I would do an independent work-study thing. I never got around to it." [...] At the age of eighteen, he obtained his GED and briefly married a woman he met after she called him on-air to request Suzanne, a song by Leonard Cohen which told a tale of a troubled relationship.

Joel Keller of TV Squad said he found Chris [...] "a little two-dimensional", and believed the relationship was poorly handled because it made Ann too passive. Lowe received particularly strong praise for his role in [...] "Flu Season", in which Chris became extremely ill and hallucinatory when infected with the flu.

The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow said after two episodes, the pairing of Chris and Ann was already more interesting that Ann's entire relationship with Mark Brendanawicz in the second season, and that the new romance subplot allowed the normally [...] "" [...] Rashida Jones to display her comedic talents. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said Chris [...] "really came into his own" [...] in the episode, and also said that Ann's relationship with Chris made her character more interesting and gave Jones greater comedic material to work with.|$|E
500|$|Griswold {{continued}} {{editing and}} contributing literary criticism for various publications, both full-time and freelance, including 22months from July 1, 1850, to April 1, 1852, with The International Magazine. There, {{he worked with}} contributors including Elizabeth Oakes Smith, Mary E. Hewitt and John R. Thompson. In the November 10, 1855, issue of The Criterion, Griswold anonymously reviewed {{the first edition of}} Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, declaring: [...] "It is impossible to image how any man's fancy could have conceived such a mass of stupid filth". Griswold charged that Whitman was guilty of [...] "the vilest imaginings and shamefullest license", a [...] "degrading, beastly sensuality." [...] Referring to Whitman's poetry, Griswold said he left [...] "this gathering of muck to the laws which... must have the power to suppress such gross obscenity." [...] Whitman later included Griswold's review in a new edition of Leaves of Grass. He ended his review with a phrase in Latin referring to [...] "that horrible sin, among Christians not to be named", the stock phrase long associated with Christian condemnations of sodomy. Griswold was the first person in the 19th century to publicly point to and stress the theme of erotic desire and acts between men in Whitman's poetry. More <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> aspect of Whitman's poetry would only surface late in the 19th century.|$|E
500|$|Pete Rock said of {{his studio}} {{experience}} with West, [...] "He's definitely hip-hop, his roots, I was testing him on joints...He takes it to another level which is dope. He had these musicians and this song, they played around my little raggedy beat and made it real. I love the way he works — he goes from one room, writing rhymes then goes to another beat and goes to another room and does something else — I love what he's done". Rapper Pusha T characterized the album as [...] "a collage of sounds" [...] and found West's methods unorthodox when recording, saying that [...] "We could easily be working on one song, thinking we're in a mode, and he'll hear a sound from someone like [...] Jeff Bhasker and immediately turn his whole <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> sound and go through his mental Rolodex to where that sound belongs on his album, and then it goes straight to that song, immediately". DJ Premier said of the production in comparison to West's previous work, [...] "Well, first of all, {{if you look at}} all of Kanye West's output, he actually did a lot to bring back sampling and make it cool again, even though he's more of a mainstream artist...but his new album is strictly hard beats and rhyme. He's totally done with electro. You're gonna be surprised what you hear".|$|E

2500|$|There was {{not enough}} {{transport}} to keep both the XX and the XXI Corps in the field at the same time. As a result, most of the lorries, tractors (excepting ammunition tractors), and camels of the XXI Corps holding the Gaza sector, were withdrawn and transferred to strengthen XX Corps' supply in the Beersheba sector, [...] "striking flank." [...] The movement of the XXI Corps transport to Shellal and Karm, along with {{the extension of the}} railway to Karm, was delayed until the last moment, to avoid drawing <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> section of the front line. Meanwhile, dumps of rations, ammunition and engineer stores were formed in the XXI Corps area in concealed positions.|$|E
2500|$|Montgomery's memoirs (1958) criticised {{many of his}} wartime comrades in harsh terms, {{including}} Eisenhower. He {{was threatened}} with legal action by Field Marshal Auchinleck for suggesting that Auchinleck had intended to retreat from the Alamein position if attacked again, and had to give a radio broadcast (20 November 1958) expressing his gratitude to Auchinleck for having stabilised the front at the First Battle of Alamein. The 1960 paperback edition of his memoirs contains a publisher's note drawing <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> broadcast, and stating that in the publisher's view the reader might reasonably assume from Montgomery's text that Auchinleck had been planning to retreat [...] "into the Nile Delta or beyond" [...] and pointing out {{that it had been}} Auchinleck's intention to launch an offensive as soon as the Eighth Army was [...] "rested and regrouped". Montgomery was stripped of his honorary citizenship of Montgomery, Alabama, and was challenged to a duel by an Italian officer.|$|E

2500|$|Technology, Davidson argues, re-shapes the way {{we learn}} and process new {{information}} in some fundamental ways. We surf hundreds of news feeds, immediately discriminating between the ones we need to read and the ones we don't. In our work environments, {{we are forced to}} focus, divide, and re-focus our attention as we are dealing with multiple tasks at the same time. Within this multitasking that the new workplace requires, Davidson urges her readers to re-imagine the concept of distraction. We are cultured to imagine that shopping online while finishing a report or answering personal emails and simultaneously working on a project are distractions which are detrimental to our productivity and efficiency. Every time we switch tasks, we are hurting our work. Davidson argues, however, that these small distractions afforded by technology should be thought of as innovations. [...] "When we feel distracted, something’s up. Distraction is really another word for saying that something is new, strange or different. We should pay <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> feeling… Distraction {{is one of the best}} tools for innovation we have at our disposal—for changing patterns of attention and beginning the process of learning new patterns" ...|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "Being-with" [...] {{refers to}} an ontological {{characteristic}} of the human being, that it is always already with others of its kind. This assertion is to be understood not as a factual statement about an individual, {{that he or she}} is at the moment in spatial proximity to one or more other individuals. [...] Rather it is a statement about the being of every human, that in the structures of its being-in-the-world one finds an implicit reference to other humans. We all live with others, and in fact we could not live without them. Humans have been called (by others, not by Heidegger) [...] "ultrasocial" [...] and [...] "obligatorily gregarious." [...] Without others of our kind we could not survive. Heidegger, from his phenomenological perspective, calls this feature of human life [...] "Being-with" [...] (Mitsein), and says it is essential to being human. We are inauthentic when we fail to recognize how much and in what ways how we think of ourselves and how we habitually behave is influenced by our social surroundings. We are authentic when we pay <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> influence and decide for ourselves whether to go along with it or not. Living entirely without such influence, however, is not an option.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{short period}} of {{development}} regarding the ideas of the album, on March 6, 2007 the band arrived at a cabin in the rural mountains of Mount Charleston, Nevada and began the writing process for the new album. After recording the new tracks and performing them live over the summer, the band returned to its native Las Vegas as well as the group's old rehearsal studio, where the band members wrote their debut record. The band grew uninterested in the songs previously written and by August scrapped the entire new album (which Ross later revealed was [...] "three-quarters" [...] done) and started over. [...] "We wanted to approach these songs in the most basic form," [...] Ross said. [...] "We wrote them all on one acoustic guitar and with someone singing. I think that we kind of skipped that part of songwriting on the first record, and this time we're sort of paying <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> [...] We've written a bunch of songs since we've been home [...] I think it's the most fun and the happiest we've been since we started." [...] With simplicity the new focus and the old album shelved, the group settled in and began recording what would become Pretty. Odd. In October, the band entered the Studio at the Palms at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas to begin recording the album.|$|E
