5|$|In 18th century France, {{there was}} a {{national}} weight standard, the marc de Paris of 8 ounces. The civil pound of 16 ounces was equivalent to 2 marks, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> used as the apothecaries' pound. With 30.6g, the ounces were considerably heavier than other apothecaries' ounces in Romance countries, but otherwise the French system was not remarkable. Its history and connections to the English and Flemish standards are discussed below under Weight standards named after Troyes.|$|E
5|$|At the outset, the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and USCG {{agreed to}} recruit and to train the members of their {{respective}} women's reserves together, using existing Navy facilities. For recruiting purposes, the SPARS would utilize the Offices of the Naval Officer Procurement. Their first recruiting efforts got underway in December 1942, but they were hampered somewhat {{by the absence of}} SPAR recruiting personnel. Their absence resulted from the agreement between the Navy and the USCG, whereby the SPARS would receive its first personnel by transfer from the WAVES. A total of 15 WAVE officers and 153 WAVE enlisted women requested and were discharged from the WAVES to become the first SPARS. Eventually, SPAR officers were assigned to most of the Naval Officer Procurement offices. The recruiting information about SPARS was disseminated with WAVES publicity materials <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> done separately. But it became apparent that the job of selling the SPARS included selling the USCG as well.|$|E

5|$|By 16:00, Schwarzenberg {{began to}} {{withdraw}} from the action, her forward rigging and forecastle burning badly. Tegetthoff decided to break off the engagement and fled to the neutral waters around Heligoland. As Tegetthoff's ships began with withdraw, one of them scored a hit on Jyllands rudder, which prevented Suenson from being able to effectively pursue the retreating Austrians and Prussians. McClintock took Aurora between the two squadrons to deter Suenson from pursuing Tegetthoff in violation of British neutrality. The two Austrian frigates had suffered a total of 36 men killed and 108 deadof those 31 killed and 81 wounded aboard Schwarzenbergand both vessels were damaged. The Danish vessels suffered 14 men killed and 54 wounded, and only Niels Juel was damaged in the action. The battle was the last to be fought solely by wooden warships, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> the last major naval action to involve the Danish Navy.|$|E
5|$|Fort Ricasoli saw {{use during}} the French {{invasion}} of Malta in 1798 and the subsequent Maltese insurrection, after which it ended up in British hands. Ricasoli {{was the site of}} the Froberg mutiny in 1807, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> used as a military hospital during the 19th century. It saw use once again in World War II, when parts of it were destroyed by aerial bombardment. After it was decommissioned in the 1960s, the fort was used for industrial purposes. Today, the fort remains mostly intact but in a dilapidated state, and it is used as a filming location and a tank cleaning facility.|$|E

5|$|Historians' {{opinions}} {{on the outcome of}} the battle are mixed, with some citing the withdrawal of Tegetthoff's ships, and the greater damage they sustained, as evidence of a tactical victory for Suenson. Other naval historians cite the lifting of the blockade as a strategic victory for the Austrians and Prussians, and others still describe the battle as inconclusive. The Battle of Heligoland was the last naval battle fought by squadrons of wooden ships, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> the last time Danish warships fought a major action. Jylland is preserved in Ebeltoft, the last surviving wooden-hulled, screw-driven warship.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Tank {{constructed}} a fourth prototype (No. 04) and, {{in an attempt}} to resolve the design's deep stall problems at high angles of attack, added stall fences on each wing and four strakes on the rear fuselage. Other refinements included a pressurized cockpit, additional fuel capacity <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> the first prototype to be fitted with the definitive four 20mm Hispano Mark V cannon armament. Lt. Jorge Doyle piloted the fourth IAe 33 on its maiden flight on 20 August 1953 and, along with Lt. Gonzalez and Lt. Balado, began armament testing in 1954.|$|E
5|$|In making {{preparations}} for filming, the producers {{found that the}} cost of production in the New York City area would be prohibitive <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> going to be difficult to find locations that resembled early 1950s New York. Part of the financing plan was hinging on a co-production deal with Canada, with filming taking place in Montreal, but Haynes joining the production led to a complete re-think. Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was set in 1950s New York. After researching the city, she found that it had not changed much in decades and the state of Ohio also had one of the best film tax incentives in the United States. The city of Cincinnati was very accommodating to the production, which employed many local citizens as crew.|$|E

Pre-race analysis noted that Armstrong, when on his best form, would be a rider very likely to gain from having such a long race against the clock included in the Giro.|$|E
5|$|On 25 May 2011, Barton's agent Willie McKay {{confirmed}} {{that his client}} would not be signing a new contract at St James' Park after contract talks broke down between the club and player.

Barton was set to leave Newcastle following his teammate Kevin Nolan, who had earlier joined West Ham United, but Barton insisted on not moving. Joey Barton also criticised the Newcastle board after it was decided he could leave the club on a free transfer. With Newcastle continuing to decline the offer of a new contract, after he refused an earlier offer, on 24 August 2011, Barton was given permission to talk to QPR. Thanking the Newcastle fans, he left on 26 August 2011.|$|E

5|$|South Indian {{music and}} dances {{such as the}} Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam styles are popular in the Deccan region. As {{a result of their}} culture policies, North Indian music and dance gained {{popularity}} during the rule of the Mughals and Nizams, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> during their reign that it became a tradition among the nobility to associate themselves with tawaif (courtesans). These courtesans were revered as the epitome of etiquette and culture, and were appointed to teach singing, poetry and classical dance to many children of the aristocracy. This gave rise to certain styles of court music, dance and poetry. Besides western and Indian popular music genres such as filmi music, the residents of Hyderabad play city-based marfa music, dholak ke geet (household songs based on local Folklore), and qawwali, especially at weddings, festivals and other celebratory events. The state government organises the Golconda Music and Dance Festival, the Taramati Music Festival and the Premavathi Dance Festival to further encourage the development of music.|$|E
5|$|The Gangavadi region {{consisted}} of the malnad region, the plains (Bayaluseemae) and the semi-malnad with lower elevation and rolling hills. The main crops of the malnad region were paddy, betel leaves, cardamom and pepper and the semi-malnad region with its lower altitude produced rice, millets such as ragi and corn, pulses, oilseeds <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> the base for cattle farming. The plains to the east were the flat lands fed by Kaveri, Tungabhadra and Vedavati rivers where cultivations of sugarcane, paddy, coconut, areca nut (adeka totta), betel leaves, plantain and flowers (vara vana) were common. Sources of irrigation were excavated tanks, wells, natural ponds and water bodies in the catchment area of dams (Katta). Inscriptions attesting to irrigation of previously uncultivated lands seem to indicate an expanding agrarian community.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} incorporated {{many modern}} features, such as sound-proofing and under-seat heating, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> the first cinema in Britain {{to make use}} of concealed neon lighting.

When built, the cinema had a short pedestrian approach to the facade, but this was removed when the A56 was widened. During the Second World War the building was used for concerts, including one given by a young Julie Andrews. It also played host to the Hallé Orchestra after the orchestra's own home, the Free Trade Hall, was bombed and severely damaged during the Manchester Blitz of 1940.|$|E

Following a lengthy pre-production phase, during which the film underwent major changes in its main cast and its technical crew, it began shooting in December 2008 at various locations throughout South India, most notably in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. The film was released on 2 April 2010 to predominantly positive reviews and was commercially successful. A Telugu dubbed version of the film titled Awara was released on 21 May in Andhra Pradesh and also received positive response <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> dubbed in Hindi as Bhaai - Ek Gangster.|$|E

Most still view the gesture as obscene. The index finger and ring finger besides the middle finger in more contemporary periods has been likened to represent the testicles.|$|E

Several attacks were repulsed, but because of men leaving their positions L Company's strength dwindled from 100 to 40 men.
