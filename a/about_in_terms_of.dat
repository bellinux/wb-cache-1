5|$|The Internet {{works in}} part because of {{protocols}} that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an Internet browser to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection. Protocols are often talked <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.|$|E

50|$|On another note, when {{it comes}} to the {{quantification}} of risk in a given system (whether it be a bank, an insurance company, a dike, a bridge, or a socio-economic system), risk needs to be accounted for over a period, such as annually. Typically one is interested in statistics such as the annual probability of loss or damage in excess of some value (Value at risk), other tail risk measures, and return periods. To provide such risk characterizations, the dynamic dragon kings must be reasoned <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> annual frequency and severity statistics.

50|$|Depending on the {{phenomena}} being observed, perhaps some dimensionless quantities aren't {{of interest and}} thus can be ignored by the modeler {{and the results of}} the scale model can still safely be assumed to correspond to the prototype. An example of this from fluid dynamics is flow of a liquid in a horizontal pipe. Possible π terms to consider in this situation are Reynolds number, Weber number, Froude number, and Mach number. For this flow configuration, however, no surface tension is involved, so the Weber number is inappropriate. Also, compression of the fluid is not applicable, so the Mach number can be disregarded. Finally, gravity is not responsible for the flow, so the Froude number can also be disregarded. This leaves the modeler with only the Reynolds number to worry <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> equating its values for the scale model and the prototype.|$|E

In 1985, he compiled two volumes on this topic in collaboration with Armand de Fluvià, with articles that had been published in the US and Spain, fighting against the inaction of homosexual groups and the misinformation of the media. In 1991, when the disease was much better understood, he published AIDS: Biblical curse or lethal disease?.|$|E
