Extraction of THF-soluble resid from the pressure-filter cakes was more complete when agglomerates were fed, leaving only 5 % or less THF solubles in the extracted cakes. When raw coal was fed, the extracted cakes contained 9 - 34 % THF solubles. HTI also observed improved filtration during the periods that agglomerates were fed. Improved operability, if verified by additional work, {{could be an}} economically significant benefit of coal cleaning by oil agglomeration at low pH. An apparently higher Mo addition rate (see fourth bullet) {{may have contributed to}} the benefits of using oil-agglomerated coal. Other stream sample characteristics changed when oil-agglomerated coal was fed in Conditions 2 - 4, relative to when uncleaned coal was fed in Conditions 1 and 5. The ash content of the 0 - 6 bottoms samples was lower when oil-agglomerates were fed. The THF-soluble 524 {degrees}C+ resid concentration in the feed slurry doubled when <b>agglomerated</b> <b>coal</b> was fed. Three factors may have influenced these characteristics. Higher coal conversion would have produced more resid. More efficient toluene-extraction of the filter cake would have recycled more resid.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} use of screen-bowl centrifuges in today's fine coal cleaning circuits, a significant amount of low-ash, high-Btu coal can be lost during the dewatering step due to the difficulty in capturing coal of this size consist (< 100 mesh or 0. 15 mm). The GranuFlow{trademark} technology, developed and patented by an in-house research group at DOE-NETL, involves the addition of an emulsified mixture of high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons to a slurry of finesized coal before cleaning and/or mechanical dewatering. The binder selectively agglomerates the coal, but not the clays or other mineral matter. In practice, the binder is applied so as to contact the finest possible size fraction first (for example, froth flotation product) as agglomeration of this fraction produces the best result for a given concentration of binder. Increasing the size consist of the fine-sized coal stream reduces the loss of coal solids to the waste effluent streams from the screen bowl centrifuge circuit. In addition, the <b>agglomerated</b> <b>coal</b> dewaters better and is less dusty. The binder can also serve as a flotation conditioner and may provide freeze protection. The overall objective of the project is to generate all necessary information and data required to commercialize the GranuFlow{trademark} Technology. The technology was evaluated under full-scale operating conditions at three commercial coal preparation plants to determine operating performance and economics. The handling, storage, and combustion properties of the coal produced by this process were compared to untreated coal during a power plant combustion test...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{oil agglomeration}} process utilises an immiscible organic liquid, such as diesel, to <b>agglomerate</b> <b>coal</b> {{in an aqueous}} suspension of coal and mineral particles. With the application of agitation, the organic liquid selectively wets {{the surface of the}} coal and subsequently binds the coal particles together to form agglomerates. During this process, the mineral matter remains finely dispersed and hence the <b>coal</b> <b>agglomerates</b> can be retrieved by passing the material over a screen. This process achieves high quality beneficiation of the fine coal, and very effective dewatering of the product. While this is a remarkably effective process the technology has not been adopted because of the very poor economics, due to the high cost of the oil. In this work an alternative immiscible binding agent consisting of a high internal phase (HIP) water-in-oil emulsion was used. This binding agent provides the interfacial functionality of the oil, with the space filling functionality provided by the stabilised water drops of the emulsion. Thus far, the HIP emulsion has successfully <b>agglomerated</b> fine <b>coal</b> in an aqueous suspension and, in addition, has done so at a lower oil requirement than when pure diesel oil was used. A two-to-three fold reduction in organic liquid consumption was achieved when the HIP emulsion was used in the place of pure diesel oil. Further reductions in the organic liquid consumption are anticipated in the future if improved methods of preparing the emulsion are realised...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{process of}} fine coal {{agglomeration}} is a beneficiation technique that uses an organic liquid, such as, diesel, to <b>agglomerate</b> fine <b>coal</b> from an aqueous suspension of coal and mineral particles. The organic binding liquid is dispersed in the aqueous suspension {{through the application}} of agitation and selectively wets and <b>agglomerates</b> the hydrophobic <b>coal</b> particles. The hydrophilic mineral particles remain finely dispersed and, thus, the product <b>coal</b> <b>agglomerates</b> can be easily retrieved by passing the suspension over a screen. Fine coal agglomeration can achieve high quality beneficiation and allows for more effective dewatering of a fine coal feed. Regardless of these excellent capabilities, however, there are no industrial applications of this process. This is because the high cost of the oil makes the process economically unfeasible. Therefore, in this study a modified fine coal agglomeration process has been investigated in which the aim is {{to reduce the amount of}} organic liquid required in the process. The modification involves the use of a water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion as the immiscible binding liquid, replacing the conventional pure oil approach. A high internal phase (HIP) emulsion is used as it provides the interfacial functionality of the oil, while the space filling functionality is provided by the stabilised internal water droplets. In this study, an investigation into the kinetics of agglomeration of the modified process was undertaken. It was found that complete agglomeration of the carbonaceous material in the feed could be achieved by the emulsion binder in one third of the time required for a pure diesel binder. In addition, the improved kinetics were achieved by the emulsion binder at an organic liquid dosage of five-times less than required by a pure diesel binder...|$|R

A digital image processing technique is used to investigate the ignition and combustion characteristics of an isolated coal water slurry droplet in low Re flow. Coal water slurry droplet study is useful for dilute coal suspensions {{based on the premise that}} ignitability of a spray of coal water slurry must depend on the ignition characteristic of an isolated coal water slurry droplet. A flat flame burner is used for optical accessibility and also for simulating vitiated gases as existing in boiler burners. A quartz wire of 0. 175 mm diameter is chosen for low thermal conductivity and to hold the droplet above theflat flame burner. The following sequence of events is observed: (i) Water first evaporates leaving <b>agglomerated</b> <b>coal</b> particle, (ii) glowing first occurs at the leading edge of the droplet, (iii) for a droplet with diameter of the order less than I mm it was observed that the volatile combustion usually occurs away from the droplet in the wake of the combustible gases made upstream, while for droplet more than I mm, the flame is attached to the particle, (iv) combustion of coal water slurry droplet is intermittent. The ignition time and volatile combustion times are obtained. Parametric studies include the effect of drop diameter and ambient oxygen concentrations.

40|$|The {{formation}} and subsequent burnout behaviour of coal slurry fuel chars {{has been studied}} using a suspended single droplet technique and solid sampling techniques in large turbulent diffusion flames. Both these techniques yielded comparable results {{on the structure of}} carbonaceous residues from a range of coal slurry fuels containing coals of different rank, size and concentration. The structure and burnout behaviour of all the fuels tested was dependant on coal rank, particle size, and concentration, although these variables did not always produce the same differences in behaviour in coal-oil and coal-water chars. Mid-rank coals, produced swollen well-fused chars which were substantially hollow and incorporated large surface blowholes. Such residues showed little tendency to fragment during combustion. Low and high rank coals produced less swollen chars which were comprised of loosely <b>agglomerated</b> <b>coal</b> particles causing more extensive internal structure and smaller surface blowholes. The furnace results of this and other studies indicate that the latter type of char structure is more conducive to rapid to rapid burnout. Small concentrations of emulsified water in coal-oil slurries were observed to increase the intensity of ebullition during devolatilisation although no evidence was obtained from any of the experimental techniques to suggest that this caused droplet shattering. However, water addition did increase the rate of combustion of coal-oil fuels. A theoretical model of the behaviour of coal slurry fuel chars during combustion has been presented which explains the experimental results in terms of the internal surface area of the char and the availability of this area to the gaseous reactants. It has been concluded that the rate of combustion of coal slurry chars of the size encountered in flames is largely controlled by the rate of internal diffusion of gaseous reactants and reaction within the porous char structure. The different reactivities of coal slurry fuels of different coal ranks has therefore been explained in terms of the various char structures which were observed The beneficial effects of water on the combustion of coal-oil fuels has also been explained within this theory since the addition of water could increase the porosity of the chars. However this has not been confirmed experimentally...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of two modified agglomeration processes for coal beneficiation is presented separately in Parts I and II of this dissertation. Part I {{is based on}} research which was conducted to study the mechanism and characteristics of a gas-promoted oil agglomeration process. Part II is based on research which was carried out to develop a newer and more innovative method for <b>agglomerating</b> <b>coal</b> particles with microscopic gas bubbles in aqueous suspensions;In Part I, the {{development of}} a gas-promoted oil agglomeration process for cleaning coal was carried out with scale model mixing systems in which aqueous suspensions of ultrafine coal particles were treated with a liquid hydrocarbon and a small amount of air. The resulting agglomerates were recovered by screening. During batch agglomeration tests the progress of agglomeration was monitored by observing changes in agitator torque in the case of concentrated suspension. A key parameter {{turned out to be the}} minimum time te required to produce compact spherical agglomerates. Other important parameters included the projected area mean particle diameter of the agglomerates recovered at the end of a test as well as the ash content and yield of agglomerates. Batch agglomeration tests were conducted with geometrically similar mixing tanks which ranged in volume from 0. 346 to 11. 07 liters;It was shown that gas bubbles trigger the process of agglomeration and participate in a very complex mechanism involving the interaction of particles, oil droplets, and gas bubbles. The process takes place in stages involving dispersion of oil and gas, flocculation, coagulation, and agglomerate building;Numerous agglomeration tests were conducted with two kinds of coal in concentrated suspensions to determine the important characteristics of the process and to study the effects of the following operating parameters: i-octane concentration, air concentration, particle concentration, tank diameter, impeller diameter, and impeller speed. Several excellent correlations between the minimum time required to produce spherical agglomerates or a final agglomerate diameter and the operating parameters were obtained by using the general linear regression method. In addition, the results provided a basis for size scale up of an agglomeration system;In Part II, the technical feasibility of a gas agglomeration method for cleaning coal was demonstrated by means of bench-scale tests conducted with a mixing system which enabled the treatment of ultrafine coal particles with a colloidal suspension of microscopic gas bubbles in water. A suitable suspension of microbubbles was produced by agitation and a small amount of i-octane. When the suspension of microbubbles and coal particles was mixed, agglomeration was rapid and small spherical agglomerates were produced. Since the agglomerates floated, they were separated from the nonfloating tailings in a settling chamber;By employing this method in numerous agglomeration tests of moderately hydrophobic coals with 26 wt. % ash, it was shown that the ash content could be reduced to 6 [...] 7 wt. % while achieving a coal recovery of 75 to 85 % on a dry, ash-free basis by using a solids concentration of 3 to 5 w/w %, air saturation of 5 to 15 psig, and i-octane concentration of 1. 0 v/w % based on the coal weight.

40|$|A novel {{technique}} is described whereby sulphur dioxide adsorbents {{can be incorporated}} directly into <b>coal</b> or coke <b>agglomerates</b> during liquid phase agglomeration using biutmen or heavy oil as the binder.

40|$|Fine coal may be {{separated}} from an aqueous suspension of coal and mineral particles {{through the application of}} a pure oil. The pure oil preferentially wets and <b>agglomerates</b> only the <b>coal,</b> forming a high quality, granular product. However, the use of the pure oil also comes at a relatively high cost and this cost prohibits commercial implementation of this process. In this work a new, economic binder, was introduced. This binder consisted of a high internal phase water-in-oil emulsion which was 95. vol% water and 5. vol% organic. This type of binder was selected as it possessed the hydrophobic surface functionality of oil while the space filling functionality of the binder was primarily satisfied by the dispersed water droplets within the emulsion. The application of this emulsion in the agglomeration process led to a 10 -fold reduction in the organic liquid dosage required to achieve agglomeration as compared a pure oil binder. It was also observed that the agglomeration time required when using the emulsion binder was one order of magnitude less than required when using a pure oil binder.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with improving this process of selective agglomeration using an immiscible binding liquid by maximising the functionality of the binder. In the past, research into the area of selective agglomeration has focussed {{on the use of}} only pure oils as binders. Pure oils are highly suitable, in a technical sense, as they are hydrophobic, immiscible with water and will preferentially wet hydrophobic particles in a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic particles. However, pure oils are equally highly unsuitable due to their cost when combined with the dosages required in the agglomeration process. Therefore, to address this issue and thus reduce the costs associated with the organic binder, a high internal phase water-in-oil emulsion was introduced as the binder. This type of emulsion was selected as it possessed the hydrophobic surface functionality of oil while the space filling functionality of the binder was primarily satisfied by the dispersed water droplets within the emulsion. In other words, it was considered that by replacing the majority of the oil with water within the binder and subsequently the agglomerate structure, the overall organic liquid requirement would be substantially reduced. The solid feed material used throughout all of the work was a naturally occurring mixture of coal and mineral particles, coal being naturally hydrophobic and minerals such as clays, being generally hydrophilic. Initial experiments indicated that the emulsion could selectively <b>agglomerate</b> <b>coal</b> {{in the same manner as}} pure diesel. Moreover, by comparing the organic liquid dosage required to achieve agglomeration when using the emulsion with the dosage required when using pure diesel it was established that a 2 -fold reduction in the organic liquid requirement was achieved. A series of investigations was then carried out which examined the influence of the composition of the emulsion and process parameters on the performance of the emulsion. It was found that the initial result could be improved by reducing the level of degradation the emulsion experienced during the agglomeration process. The highlight of this work was the result for a 3 wt% aqueous NaCl-in-kerosene emulsion which achieved a 10 -fold reduction as compared to the benchmark diesel case. This emulsion achieved agglomeration in only 7 s and thus experienced the lowest level of degradation which resulted from mixing in the turbulent, aqueous environment of the agglomeration process. Moreover, it was shown that if the emulsion was pre-dispersed in water prior to the combination of the emulsion with the coal slurry the mixing time required to achieve agglomeration was only 3 s. Following on from the development of the emulsion binder, a fundamental investigation into binder functionality was carried out. It was found that the organic liquid requirement to achieve agglomeration was a function of the specific surface area of the material to be agglomerated and the voidage within the agglomerate material. Moreover, it appeared that the dispersed, water droplets within the emulsion played a space filling role within the void spaces, as hypothesised, however the thin film which formed around the particles comprised only of organic liquid and thus the water droplets did not play a space-filling role. That being said, the results indicated that the film formed when using the emulsion was 178 nm which was approximately 4 -times thinner than the film formed when using pure kerosene. Therefore, the results from this investigation indicated that the reduction which may be achieved is a function not only of the dispersed phase of the emulsion but also of the surface area of the feed. Due to the successful development of the agglomeration process using the emulsion a final investigation was carried out to study the potential application of this work in an industrial coal processing setting. It was found that the ash% and moisture content of the agglomerated product was sufficiently low to meet market requirements. In particular it was found that the emulsion binder consistently produced a product with an ash of 10 – 11 % leaving behind reject with an ash of 80 % from a feed with an ash of 61 %, providing that the emulsion dosage was sufficient. Overall, the work in this study has resulted in the development of a rapid agglomeration process with reduced organic reagent requirements.

In order to use waste fi ne coal effi ciently, a retrieval technique is necessary for the recov-ery of combustible contents of coal from fi ne waste coals.

40|$|During {{pulverized}} coal combustion, a fume of submicron particles is formed when minerals that have volatilized from the parent coal nucleate to form new particles. The particles thus generated are extremely small, but they grow rapidly due to Brownian coagulation. Much {{has been learned}} about these fine particles in experimental studies of the particles formed in coal combustion. Measurements of the variation of chemical composition with particle size clearly demonstrate that the particles smaller than about 0. 1 {mu}m in diameter are formed from vapors while larger particles are dominated by residues from the mineral matter in the coal. Theoretical predictions {{of the evolution of}} the particle size distribution suggest that the nuclei should produce a sharp peak which may approach 0. 1 {mu}m, but they are unlikely to grow much beyond that size in the limited time available in practical combustors.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Technikon, 2000. Internationally, {{there is}} an {{increase}} in the need for safer environmental processes that can be applied to mining operations, especially on a small scale, where mercury amalgamation is the main process used for the recovery of free gold. An alternative, more environmentally acceptable, process called the Coal Gold Agglomeration (CGA) process has been investigated at the Cape Technikon. This paper explains the application of flotation as a means of separation for the CGA process. The CGA process is based on the recovery of hydrophobic gold particles from ore slurries into <b>agglomerates</b> formed from <b>coal</b> and oil. The agglomerates are separated from the slurry through scraping, screening, flotation or a combination of the aforementioned. They are then ashed to release the gold particles, after which it is smelted to form gold bullion. All components were contacted for fifty minutes after which a frother was added and after three minutes of conditioning, air, at a rate of one I/min per cell volume was introduced into the system. The addition of a collector (Potassium Amyl Xanthate) at the start of each run significantly improved gold recoveries. Preliminary experiments indicated that the use of baffles decreased the gold recoveries, which was concluded to be due to agglomerate breakage. The system was also found to be frother-selective and hence only DOW- 200 was used in subsequent experiments. A significant increase or decrease in the air addition rate both had a negative effect on the recoveries; therefore, the air addition rate was not altered during further tests. The use of tap water as opposed to distilled water decreased the attainable recoveries by less than five per cent. This was a very encouraging result, in terms of the practical implementation of the CGA process...|$|R
40|$|Selective {{agglomeration}} {{using an}} oil binder {{has been considered}} for the processing of fine coal {{many times in the}} past. However, the cost of the oil binder has always proven to be too high for commercial applications. This work revisited the technique of fine coal agglomeration in an effort to create an economically viable process and, thus, increase the overall utilisation of the coal resource. A novel and economic binder which consisted of a water-in-oil emulsion (95 vol% water and 5 vol% oil) was introduced. This emulsion was considered to be an economic alternative to pure oil as it had the potential to drastically reduce the amount of oil required in the process. A reduction was possible as the dispersed water droplets within the emulsion occupied the majority of the void space within the agglomerate; a space which would otherwise have to be filled with oil. In other words, the emulsion possessed an enhanced space-filling functionality. The use of oil as the continuous phase also meant that the necessary hydrophobic surface functionality of the binder was maintained. In this study the selectivity of the new emulsion binder was investigated and compared to the selectivity of a pure kerosene binder. The coal feed used in the study contained particles in the size range of 0 – 2 mm which also afforded the opportunity to study the ability of the emulsion to <b>agglomerate</b> and recover <b>coal</b> over a broad size range. It was found that the selectivity of the emulsion matched that of pure kerosene and consistently resulted in a low, < 15 (%ad), ash product.

40|$|Oil {{agglomeration}} {{combined with}} bubble flotation {{has proven to}} be an effective means of upgrading and recovering waste fine coal when low-oil floc-type agglomerates are formed. Low-oil recovery is desirable, since less ash is incorporated into the agglomerates and the expense of using oil is reduced. In this state, the flocs are too small and weak for screen separation but can be successfully recovered by flotation as even a small amount of oil imparts a much improved surface character, and agglomerate strength is less important. Reduction of the amount of wetting phase used in the oil agglomeration process for advance coal cleaning and utilization technologies is important to the economics of the process. An analysis was made of the agglomerate surface properties and on the size enlargement characteristics and possible mechanisms of the process taking place when floc-type coal-oil agglomerates are formed at oil levels less than about 2 % oil by weight. Since this product exists not as dense agglomerates but only as small aggregates of a few particles, the adhesion technique was used to determine the surface properties of agglomerates made from a high purity coal. The surface properties closely matched those of the oil at agglomerate oil-levels above 2 % by weight. Particle-size measurements by laser diffraction were then correlated to the surface properties {{as a function of the}} oil-level and of agglomerate particle packing. Subsequently, the surface free energies of <b>agglomerates</b> made from <b>coals</b> of several different ranks were measured by the adhesion technique. Oil levels from 0 to 10 % by weight were used. As was expected, it was found that higher-rank coals are more easily oil-wetted and that the surface properties of the agglomerates correlate with agglomeration recovery and ash removal data. It has been illustrated in pilot studies that oil-agglomeration together with flotation gives an enhanced combustibles recovery and ash separation. To corroborate successful flotation results for such agglomerates, a computational fluid dynamics simulation was formulated to model their recovery. This simulation employed the finite volume method, and featured three-phase flow as well as the collection of particles by bubbles. Additionally, a novel formulation of a boundary element method for unsteady full Navier-Stokes flow was undertaken to model the collisional aspects of micro-flotation. This method was successfully implemented, but problems with numerical instability in the required flow regimes prevented a more detailed micro-flotation study in the present work. The surface properties of coal-oil agglomerates were incorporated into a model based on the resolved hydrodynamics of the flotation process. The overall result was an integrated model where individual local mechanisms could be summed to determine recovery values which compared very well to a wide range of data.
