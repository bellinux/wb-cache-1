40|$|Summary: With {{the aim of}} {{revealing}} a possible magnesium (Mg) deficiency in the aetiology of idiopathic recurrent calcium urolithiasis we studied the Mg content of red blood cells, serum total, protein-bound, ionised <b>and</b> <b>complexed</b> fractions of Mg, and urinary Mg after an overnight fast. The two study groups comprised 12 male recurrent calcium urolithiasis patients and 12 healthy male controls (mean age 31 and 29 years, respectively). In recurrent calcium urolithiasis, serum albumin and Mg of erythrocytes were significantly decreased, as was serum total and protein-bound Mg, whereas serum ultrafiltrable, ionised <b>and</b> <b>complexed</b> Mg were statistically indistinguishable from values in controls. Urinary Mg (per unit creatinine) in recurrent calcium urolithiasis (mean 0. 188 vs 0. 209 in controls; p = 0. 386) was not statistically different, whereas urinary total protein, glucose, and pH were significantly increased. The renal clearances of Mg and glucose were positively correlated (r = 0. 56; p < 0. 01), with a steeper slope in recurrent calcium urolithiasis than controls. Further fractionation of serum and urinary Mg into ions <b>and</b> <b>complexes</b> in recurrent calcium urolithiasis subjects with identical creatinine clearance revealed no statistical difference between 1) Mg ions <b>and</b> <b>complexes</b> filtered by renal glomeruli; 2) Mg ions <b>and</b> <b>complexes</b> excreted in urine; 3) fractional Mg excretion...|$|R
