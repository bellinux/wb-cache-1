5|$|Early {{research}} on the galactic habitable zone, including the 2001 paper by Gonzalez, Brownlee, and Ward, did not demarcate any specific boundaries, merely stating that the zone was an <b>annulus</b> encompassing a region of the galaxy that was both enriched with metals and spared from excessive radiation, and that habitability {{would be more likely}} in the galaxy's thin disk. However, later research conducted in 2004 by Lineweaver and colleagues did create boundaries for this <b>annulus,</b> {{in the case of the}} Milky Way ranging from 4 kpc to 10 kpc from the galactic center.|$|E
5|$|If two of {{the three}} given circles do not intersect, a center of {{inversion}} can be chosen so that those two given circles become concentric. Under this inversion, the solution circles must fall within the <b>annulus</b> between the two concentric circles. Therefore, they belong to two one-parameter families. In the first family (Figure7), the solutions do not enclose the inner concentric circle, but rather revolve like ball bearings in the <b>annulus.</b> In the second family (Figure8), the solution circles enclose the inner concentric circle. There are generally four solutions for each family, yielding eight possible solutions, consistent with the algebraic solution.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{municipalities}} and counties in Ohio have adopted pennants and swallowtails {{based on the}} state burgee. The city of Mentor and Adams County have flags that essentially replace the <b>annulus</b> with a seal and modify the pattern of stars in the triangular union.|$|E
5|$|An annular eclipse {{occurs when}} the Sun and Moon are exactly {{in line with the}} Earth, but the {{apparent}} size of the Moon is smaller than that of the Sun. Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or <b>annulus,</b> surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Another {{transitional}} {{feature of}} Dimetrodon is a ridge {{in the back}} of the jaw called the reflected lamina. The reflected lamina is found on the articular bone, which connects to the quadrate bone of the skull to form the jaw joint. In later mammal ancestors, the articular and quadrate separated from the jaw joint while the articular developed into the malleus bone of the middle ear. The reflected lamina became part of a ring called the tympanic <b>annulus</b> that supports the ear drum in all living mammals.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria species form fleshy, white-spored {{mushrooms}} with a cottony or membranous veil {{that typically}} forms a distinct <b>annulus</b> on the stem. The fruit bodies usually occur in autumn in large clusters {{at the base}} of the stem or roots. Armillaria species can produce rhizomorphs—rootlike aggregations of hyphae—that can form massive, long-lasting underground networks. The growth of the rhizomorph networks allows for tree-to-tree spread of the fungus even when direct contact between diseased and healthy plants is not possible.|$|E
5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, using an {{extension}} of the flow to non-smooth curves based on the level set method, there are only two possibilities. Curves with zero Lebesgue measure (including all polygons and piecewise-smooth curves) instantly evolve into smooth curves, after which they evolve as any smooth curve would. However, Osgood curves with nonzero measure instead immediately evolve into a topological <b>annulus</b> with nonzero area and smooth boundaries. The topologist's sine curve is an example that instantly becomes smooth, despite not even being locally connected; examples such as this show that the reverse evolution of the curve-shortening flow can take well-behaved curves to complicated singularities in a finite amount of time.|$|E
5|$|Internal parasites of {{the common}} loon include many species of worms, {{including}} flatworms, tapeworms, nematodes and spiny-headed worms. High levels of worms may result from feeding changes due to low availability of fish, {{and can lead to}} illness and death. Protozoal infections including one caused by Eimeria gaviae and avian malaria has been recorded in this loon. The black fly Simulium <b>annulus</b> is closely associated with the common loon to which it is attracted to chemicals in the uropygial gland secretions as well as by visual and tactile cues. This fly is detrimental to loons, their preferred hosts, transmitting blood-borne parasites and viruses, and causing nest abandonment when numbers are high. External parasites include ischnoceran feather lice, although these are not found on the bird's head.|$|E
5|$|It took until 1994 for the Queen {{to approve}} the new design for general use, though the Canadian Heraldic Authority began to allow for its limited use {{beginning}} in 1987, where the arms were used to represent the Queen personally on letters patent granting new arms for distinguished Canadians. These letters patent carried the shield from the royal arms along with the <b>annulus</b> behind the shield bearing the motto of the Order of Canada—Desiderantes meliorem patriam. As soon as royal approval was forthcoming, the full achievement was redesigned {{for use by the}} federal government within the Federal Identity Program. The present design of the arms of Canada was drawn by Cathy Bursey-Sabourin, Fraser Herald at the Canadian Heraldic Authority.|$|E
5|$|The genus {{once served}} as a {{wastebasket}} taxon for many agaric mushrooms with a white spore print, gills attached to the stem, and an <b>annulus.</b> Due largely to differing interpretations on {{the limits of the}} genus, over 270 species and varieties have been placed in Armillaria or its synonym Armillariella. A comprehensive 1995 study by Tom Volk and Harold Burdsall evaluated all of the epithets that have been used in Armillaria or Armillariella. They determined that about 40 species belong to Armillaria sensu stricto (in the strict sense); the remaining names belong to species that are distributed among 43 other modern fungal genera.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent studies {{saw more}} {{fundamental}} {{revision of the}} old concept of the galactic habitable zone as an <b>annulus.</b> In 2008, a study by Nikos Prantzos revealed that, while {{the probability of a}} planet escaping sterilization by supernova was highest at a distance of about 10 kpc from the galactic center, the sheer density of stars in the inner galaxy meant that the highest number of habitable planets could be found there. The research was corroborated in a 2011 paper by Michael Gowanlock, who calculated the frequency of supernova-surviving planets as a function of their distance from the galactic center, their height above the galactic plane, and their age, ultimately discovering that about 0.3% of stars in the galaxy could today support complex life, or 1.2% if one does not consider the tidal locking of red dwarf planets as precluding the development of complex life.|$|E
5|$|The {{usefulness}} of inversion {{can be increased}} significantly by resizing. As noted in Viète's reconstruction, the three given circles and the solution circle can be resized in tandem while preserving their tangencies. Thus, the initial Apollonius problem is transformed into another problem that may be easier to solve. For example, the four circles can be resized so that one given circle is shrunk to a point; alternatively, two given circles can often be resized {{so that they are}} tangent to one another. Thirdly, given circles that intersect can be resized so that they become non-intersecting, after which the method for inverting to an <b>annulus</b> can be applied. In all such cases, the solution of the original Apollonius problem is obtained from the solution of the transformed problem by undoing the resizing and inversion.|$|E
25|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} and {{a corresponding}} {{enlargement of the}} left atrium may cause an increase in size of the mitral valve <b>annulus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since {{the mapping}} w=Logz {{transforms}} circles centered at 0 into vertical straight line segments, {{it is useful}} in engineering applications involving an <b>annulus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Poincaré–Birkhoff theorem: every area-preserving, orientation-preserving homeomorphism of an <b>annulus</b> that rotates the two {{boundaries}} {{in opposite directions}} has at least two fixed points.|$|E
25|$|In the {{mathematical}} discipline known as complex dynamics, the Herman ring is a Fatou component where the rational function is conformally conjugate to an irrational {{rotation of the}} standard <b>annulus.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{the overall}} or {{external}} {{size of a}} roundabout (in the UK {{referred to as the}} Inscribed Circle Diameter – ICD) is reduced, so the maximum practicable (and prescribed) diameter for the central island is also reduced, whilst the width of the circulatory carriageway increases (due to the greater width of vehicle swept path at smaller turning radii). In most cases this results in it being too easy – certainly when traffic is light relative to capacity – for drivers to traverse the roundabout at relatively high speed, with scant regard for road markings or the potential dangers to self or conflicts with other road users. To mitigate this risk, a proportion of the circulatory carriageway – an <b>annulus</b> around the central island – is segregated from general use by demarcation lines and differentiated from the outer <b>annulus</b> of carriageway by a combination of slightly raised surface, adverse crossfall, contrasting colours and textures and demarcating lines. The effect of this is to discourage drivers from taking a more direct path through the roundabout, their line of least resistance being more tightly curved (and therefore slower) but more bearable. The inner <b>annulus</b> provides for the trailing axles of longer or articulated vehicles to sweep across the inner <b>annulus,</b> which is therefore known as an over-run area (in UK usage), truck apron, or mountable apron.|$|E
25|$|The {{sliding sleeve}} is {{hydraulically}} or mechanically actuated to allow {{communication between the}} tubing and the 'A' <b>annulus.</b> They are often used in multiple reservoir wells to regulate flow {{to and from the}} zones.|$|E
25|$|Ischemic {{heart disease}} causes MI by the {{combination}} of ischemic dysfunction of the papillary muscles, and the dilatation of the left ventricle. This {{can lead to the}} subsequent displacement of the papillary muscles and the dilatation of the mitral valve <b>annulus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Natural gas {{extracted}} from oil wells is called casinghead gas (whether or not truly produced up the <b>annulus</b> {{and through a}} casinghead outlet) or associated gas. The natural gas industry is extracting an increasing quantity of gas from challenging resource types: sour gas, tight gas, shale gas, and coalbed methane.|$|E
25|$|Epicyclic gears {{are also}} called {{planetary}} gears because the axes {{of the planet}} gears revolve around the common axis {{of the sun and}} ring gears that they mesh with and roll between. In the image, the yellow shaft carries the sun gear which is almost hidden. The blue gears are called planet gears and the pink gear is the ring gear or <b>annulus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The walking legs again {{follow the}} typical {{arachnid}} plan with a coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, metatarsus and tarsus. The coxae surround a single sternum. In well preserved palaeocharinids {{there is a}} ring, or <b>annulus,</b> around the trochanter–femur joint {{which may be the}} remains of an earlier leg segment. The legs are largely unmodified, although in Anthracosironidae the forelegs are quite large and spiny, presumably to help catch prey. The legs end in three claws, two large ones and a smaller median claw.|$|E
25|$|Multiple causes {{exist for}} AI {{in the setting}} of {{ascending}} aortic dissection. The dissection may dilate the <b>annulus</b> of the aortic valve, so that the leaflets of the valve cannot coapt. Another mechanism is that the dissection may extend into the aortic root and detach the aortic valve leaflets. The third mechanism is that if there was an extensive intimal tear, the intimal flap may prolapse into the LV outflow tract, causing intimal intussusception into the aortic valve preventing proper valve closure.|$|E
25|$|Intumescent firestops {{are often}} used, {{in the event}} plastic pipes are used for toilet drains, so that the melting plastic pipe is choked off {{in the event of}} an {{accidental}} fire. It is, however, customary to fill the metallic drain pipe <b>annulus</b> with rockwool packing. Even with the best of intentions, it would be difficult for the firestopper to install a sealant, because the installer is not allowed to remove the flange, which is partially used to support the drain pipe below during the installation process.|$|E
25|$|The {{collector}} of a centrifugal compressor {{can take many}} shapes and forms. When the diffuser discharges into a large empty chamber, the collector may be termed a Plenum. When the diffuser discharges into a device that looks somewhat like a snail shell, bull's horn or a French horn, the collector {{is likely to be}} termed a volute or scroll. As the name implies, a collector’s purpose is to gather the flow from the diffuser discharge <b>annulus</b> and deliver this flow to a downstream pipe. Either the collector or the pipe may also contain valves and instrumentation to control the compressor.|$|E
25|$|As {{the range}} of {{permissible}} transformations becomes broader, {{the range of}} objects one is able to distinguish as preserved by {{the application of the}} transformations becomes narrower. Similarity transformations are fairly narrow (they preserve the relative distance between points) and thus allow us to distinguish relatively many things (e.g., equilateral triangles from non-equilateral triangles). Continuous transformations (which can intuitively be thought of as transformations which allow non-uniform stretching, compression, bending, and twisting, but no ripping or glueing) allow us to distinguish a polygon from an <b>annulus</b> (ring with a hole in the centre), but do not allow us to distinguish two polygons from each other.|$|E
25|$|This is {{selected}} where the liner {{is required to}} mechanically hold back the movement of formation sand. There are many variants of openhole sand control, the three popular choices being stand-alone screens, openhole gravel packs (also known as external gravel packs, where a sized sand 'gravel' is placed as an <b>annulus</b> around the sand control screen) and expandable screens. Screen designs are mainly wire-wrap or premium; wire-wrap screens use spiral-welded corrosion-resistant wire wrapped around a drilled basepipe to provide a consistent small helical gap (such as , termed 12 gauge). Premium screens use a woven metal cloth wrapped around a basepipe. Expandable screens are run to depth before being mechanically swaged to a larger diameter. Ideally, expandable screens will be swaged until they contact the wellbore wall.|$|E
25|$|It is {{considered}} to be an outstanding edible species with a distinctively sweet or nutty flavor. However, great caution must be exercised to properly identify it, as the deadly Amanita ocreata (and occasionally Amanita phalloides) is also found in the same habitat at the same time of year, and can often be found in close proximity to each other. A. ocreata and A. phalloides have thin universal veil remnants, a sac-like volva, an <b>annulus,</b> a non-striate pileus margin, and a pileus that is a different color than A. velosa. These differences can fade as the fruiting body ages, making it important to collect only specimens that have all of their identifying characteristics intact. Some authorities {{go so far as to}} say no Amanita should be considered for eating.|$|E
25|$|Although no {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} identified as endangered or vulnerable, it is important to acknowledge that there are a plethora of invertebrates within the Cape Byron Marine Park which are critical {{to the health of the}} local ecosystems. These include a variety of molluscs such as the gold ring cowries (Cypraea <b>annulus),</b> Crustaceans such as the Zebra Shrimp (Ganthophylum americanum) and a specimen of the seven armed sea star (Luidia australiae). These Invertebrates have been noted as they are not usually found in areas and climates such as the Cape Byron Marine Park. The Zebra Shrimp and the seven armed sea star are rarely found in intertidal habitats and the gold ring cowries share a tropical affinity and demonstrate a rare occurrence in which the Cape Byron Marine Park is a habitat for both temperate and tropical species.|$|E
25|$|One {{description}} {{of the types of}} simple-closed curves that may appear {{on the surface of the}} Klein bottle is given by the use of the first homology group of the Klein bottle calculated with integer coefficients. This group is isomorphic to Z×Z2. Up to reversal of orientation, the only homology classes which contain simple-closed curves are as follows: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (0,1). Up to reversal of the orientation of a simple closed curve, if it lies within one of the two crosscaps that make up the Klein bottle, then it is in homology class (1,0) or (1,1); if it cuts the Klein bottle into two Möbius strips, then it is in homology class (2,0); if it cuts the Klein bottle into an <b>annulus,</b> then it is in homology class (0,1); and if bounds a disk, then it is in homology class (0,0).|$|E
25|$|Upon {{admission}} {{into the}} Order of Military Merit, members are presented the appropriate insignia, though these remain {{property of the}} Crown. The Sovereign's insignia is a jewelled, 18kt gold crown of rubies, emeralds, and sapphires, from which is suspended a blue enamelled cross pattée with four equal arms and three diamonds between each. At the centre is a disc bearing a maple leaf in pavé-laid rubies on a white enamel background, surrounded at its edge by a red enamel ring (<b>annulus)</b> bearing the words MERIT • MÉRITE • CANADA. The Chancellor wears the badge of a Commander, though is also, upon installation as governor general, granted a livery collar for wear at Order of Military Merit investiture ceremonies; this is composed {{of a series of}} gold medallions, and supports an enamel rendition of the shield of the Royal Arms of Canada, from which the governor general's badge is suspended.|$|E
25|$|Calixarenes are characterised by a {{three-dimensional}} basket, cup or bucket shape. In calixarenes the internal volume is around 10 cubic angstroms. Calixarenes are characterised {{by a wide}} upper rim and a narrow lower rim and a central <b>annulus.</b> With phenol as a starting material the 4 hydroxyl groups are intrannular on the lower rim. In a resorcinarene 8 hydroxyl groups are placed extraannular on the upper ring. Calixarenes exist in different chemical conformations because rotation around the methylene bridge is not difficult. In calixarene 4 up-down conformations exist: cone (point group C2v,C4v), partial cone Cs, 1,2 alternate C2h and 1,3 alternate D2d. The 4 hydroxyl groups interact by hydrogen bonding and stabilize the cone conformation. This conformation is in dynamic equilibrium with the other conformations. Conformations can be locked in place with proper substituents replacing the hydroxyl groups which increase the rotational barrier. Alternatively placing a bulky substituent on the upper rim also locks a conformation. The calixarene based on p-tert-butyl phenol is also a cone. Calixarenes are structurally related to the pillararenes.|$|E
25|$|The two given circles α and β cannot intersect; hence, {{the smaller}} given circle must lie {{inside or outside}} the larger. The circles are usually shown as an <b>annulus,</b> i.e., with the smaller given circle inside the larger one. In this configuration, the Steiner-chain circles are {{externally}} tangent to the inner given circle and internally tangent to the outer circle. However, the smaller circle may also lie completely outside the larger one (Figure 2). The black circles of Figure 2 satisfy the conditions for a closed Steiner chain: they are all tangent to the two given circles and each is tangent to its neighbors in the chain. In this configuration, the Steiner-chain circles have {{the same type of}} tangency to both given circles, either externally or internally tangent to both. If the two given circles are tangent at a point, the Steiner chain becomes an infinite Pappus chain, which is often discussed {{in the context of the}} arbelos (shoemaker's knife), a geometric figure made from three circles. There is no general name for a sequence of circles tangent to two given circles that intersect at two points.|$|E
25|$|More {{sophisticated}} techniques {{will show}} proportional differences in optical density. Phase contrast {{is a widely}} used technique that shows differences in refractive index as difference in contrast. It {{was developed by the}} Dutch physicist Frits Zernike in the 1930s (for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1953). The nucleus in a cell for example will show up darkly against the surrounding cytoplasm. Contrast is excellent; however it is not for use with thick objects. Frequently, a halo is formed even around small objects, which obscures detail. The system consists of a circular <b>annulus</b> in the condenser, which produces a cone of light. This cone is superimposed on a similar sized ring within the phase-objective. Every objective has a different size ring, so for every objective another condenser setting has to be chosen. The ring in the objective has special optical properties: it, first of all, reduces the direct light in intensity, but more importantly, it creates an artificial phase difference of about a quarter wavelength. As the physical properties of this direct light have changed, interference with the diffracted light occurs, resulting in the phase contrast image. One disadvantage of phase-contrast microscopy is halo formation (halo-light ring).|$|E
25|$|The car {{now has the}} {{addition}} of the Advanced Aerodynamic Package (two-piece front corner splitters and a rear decklid spoiler made from carbon fiber), lightweight Sidewinder II wheels finished in matte-black, Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires, two-mode (Street and Race) Bilstein DampTronic suspension adapted from the GTS, but with firmer levels of damping and a smaller spread between modes, shock dampers, increased spring rates and thicker anti-roll bars, carbon fiber underhood X-brace (instead of the aluminium brace in all other models), carbon fiber rear tail light applique from the Exterior Carbon Fiber Accent Package, two-piece Brembo brake rotors with wider brake <b>annulus,</b> black-anodized Brembo brake calipers painted with the Viper logo in TA Orange, TA logos behind both front wheels and a Stryker decal instead of the standard badge on the hood (TA Orange on the Venom Black cars, black on the TA Orange and Venom White cars), black interior with TA Orange accent stitching on the ballistic cloth seats, instrument panel & cowl, center stack, console, hand brake, shifter boot, and door panels. The aerodynamic package adds 200 pounds (90.72kg) of downforce at 100mph (160.93km/h). Top speed is 193mph (310.60km/h) instead of the non-aerodynamics package cars' 206mph (331.52km/h). The car's mileage is 12 mpg in city, and 19 mpg in highway.|$|E
25|$|Echocardiography is a {{non-invasive}} method of quantifying cardiac output using ultrasound. Two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound and Doppler measurements are used together to calculate cardiac output. 2D {{measurement of the}} diameter (d) of the aortic <b>annulus</b> allows calculation of the flow cross-sectional area (CSA), which is then multiplied by the VTI of the Doppler flow profile across the aortic valve to determine the flow volume per beat (stroke volume, SV). The result is then multiplied by the heart rate (HR) to obtain cardiac output. Although used in clinical medicine, it has a wide test-retest variability. It is said to require extensive training and skill, but the exact steps needed to achieve clinically adequate precision have never been disclosed. 2D measurement of the aortic valve diameter is one source of noise; others are beat-to-beat variation in stroke volume and subtle differences in probe position. An alternative {{that is not necessarily}} more reproducible is the measurement of the pulmonary valve to calculate right-sided CO. Although it is in wide general use, the technique is time consuming and is limited by the reproducibility of its component elements. In the manner used in clinical practice, precision of SV and CO is of the order of ±20%.|$|E
