40|$|The {{popularity}} of {{ground source heat pump}} systems for both {{heating and cooling}} has grown significantly over recent years. Ground heat exchangers are usually buried in the ground either vertically in boreholes or horizontally in trenches. <b>Antifreeze</b> <b>fluids</b> in closed-loop systems are commonly used in these plants to protect them from freezing phenomena and also to reduce the total length of the ground exchangers. In fact, the use of antifreeze fluid allows the system to work below 0 °C which implies higher temperature difference between the heat-carrier fluid and the undisturbed ground, consequently the heat flux increases and the total length of the boreholes can be reduced. This study has been set out to investigate three types of layout system: two conventional heat pumps using pure water and water-glycol respectively as the secondary fluid and an innovative heat pump with a flooded evaporator using pure water. The results demonstrated that, for conventional heat pumps with dry evaporator, the use of anti-freeze additives in mild climates is convenient only in grid-shaped borehole fields with a heating-dominant thermal load. In all other cases, the use of pure water decreases the overall operating costs. In addition, flooded evaporator heat pumps using pure water as a secondary fluid on the ground loop proved to be the most cost-effective solution...|$|E

40|$|Low-temperature {{geothermal}} {{resources have}} become very competitive thanks to their considerable environmental benefits, including the reduction in CO 2 emissions and other greenhouse gases. Geothermal systems for heating or cooling of buildings use heat available in {{the upper part of}} the subsurface; this is often done via Ground Soil Heat Pump systems that can be generally closed or open. The former are considered in this study. Closed systems are commonly known as Ground-Coupled Heat Pumps (GCHPs). In a GCHP system, heat is extracted from or rejected to the ground via an external closed circuit constituting the ground heat exchanger (GHE) through which pure water or <b>antifreeze</b> <b>fluid</b> circulates. The GHEs commonly used consist of high-density polyethylene pipes (HDPE) installed in either vertical boreholes or in horizontal trenches. This paper deals with heat exchangers installed inside foundation piles; heat extraction from the subsoil is investigated in the case of clay and dry sand and in saturated sand where groundwater flow occurs. Moreover, in examining the role of groundwater flow in the performance of GHEs, the paper investigates to what extent taking into account the right velocity field for seepage around the pile instead of using a schematic uniform value affects the results. A mathematical model in 2 D space is introduced, comprising a pair of parabolic and elliptic partial differential equations for soil temperature and the groundwater velocity field, respectively. The equations are solved numerically by means of the Finite Difference Method and Finite Element Method, respectively. The numerical model is validated by comparing the results of the conduction equation with the solutions of cylindrical and infinite line source (CILS and ILS) and those of the advection-diffusion equation with a moving infinite line source (MILS) model. The results show that groundwater flow is able to restore the initial undisturbed temperature in the subsoil very quickly and it is essential to take into account the correct seepage field around the GHEs to estimate system efficiency correctly for high values of velocity (> 2 ∙ 10 - 5 m/s) ...|$|R

40|$|Glycerol has {{historically}} {{been used as a}}n <b>antifreeze</b> <b>fluid</b> to facilitate heat transfer in the automotive and air conditioning and refrigeration industries. It has also been used as a lubricant in the processing of food and the production of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Although a lot of work has been done recently to evaluate the potential to enhance heat transfer using nanoparticles mixed with a base fluid to form a nanofluid, no work has been done on using glycerol as a base fluid. Therefore {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effect of nanoparticle volume fraction, nanoparticle size and temperature on the thermal conductivity of stable glycerol-based nanofluids. Two types of metal oxide nanoparticles were considered namely MgO and ?-Al 2 O 3. The particle sizes of the MgO ranged from 21 nm to 119 nm and for the ?-Al 2 O 3 it ranged from 31 nm to 134 nm. The thermal conductivities were determined by experimental measurements and with analytical and empirical models. The thermal conductivity measurements were taken at temperatures ranging from 20 ?C to 45 ?C, for nanofluids prepared at volume fractions ranging from 0. 5 % to 4 %. The nanofluids were prepared with a two-step method that included ultrasound mixing to ensure the nanoparticles were fully dispersed and deagglomerated in the glycerol. The experimental results showed that both the ?-Al 2 O 3 -glycerol and MgO-glycerol nanofluids had substantially higher thermal conductivity than the base fluid. It was also found that at room temperature, the effective thermal conductivity remains almost constant for at least 50 hours. The maximum thermal conductivity enhancement for the ?-Al 2 O 3 -glycerol nanofluids was observed for a 4 % volume fraction to be 19. 5 % for a nanoparticle size of 31 nm. For the MgO-glycerol nanofluids the maximum thermal conductivity enhancements were also for a volume fraction of 4 %, however, the enhancement was 18 % for a particle size of 21 nm. Furthermore, the thermal conductivities as function of nanoparticle size, volume fraction and temperature, of the two nanofluids were investigated. It was found that the thermal conductivities of the ?-Al 2 O 3 -glycerol nanofluids were significantly more dependent on particle size than the MgO-glycerol nanofluids. Furthermore, it was found that no equations exist at present that can accurately predict the thermal conductivity of glycerol based nanofluids and therefore new empirical equations correlations were developed.

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the {{geothermal}} energy, that is, energy emitted continuously {{in the form of}} heat from our planet, that from the deepest areas propagates towards the surface. The research activities have been carried out for evaluating different aspects related to geothermal energy and more specifically the way in which this energy can be extracted. The present work has tried to deal with all the different levels of temperature in which the geothermal energy is classified, i. e. low temperature, medium temperature and high temperature, as hereafter described more in detail. Geothermal Energy low temperature: this energy is transferred by means of ground heat exchangers coupled with a heat pump. In this case usually the heat transfer fluid can be water or a mixture containing water and an <b>antifreeze</b> <b>fluid.</b> In the frame of this technology first the characteristics of a GRT (ground response test) has been tested, in order to check the accuracy of the method to evaluate the average temperature of the ground, as well as to determine the thermal conductivity of the soil and the overall coefficient of linear heat exchange between the transfer fluid and the soil. The accuracy of the GRT has been evaluated for different sizes of the grout (an usual ground heat exchanger and a pile) as well as for different velocities of the aquifer. The simulations have been carried out by means of a Finite Element Method (FEM) software. Then the FEM has been used for evaluating the energy and structural analysis on piles foundations when they are used as ground heat exchangers. The work has shown the combined effect of structural loads in heating and cooling periods. The results are in agreement to the theory as well as to results carried out by measurements which have been found in literature. Finally a study for comparing different heat pumps and different fluids in the ground heat exchangers has been carried out in mild climates. The work shows the benefits of using pure water as heat transfer fluid in almost all conditions, since in mild climates the temperature of the ground is around 14 °C and usually heat pumps are used for both heating and cooling, thus allowing the ground to be regenerated over one year. The use of flooded evaporators in the heat pumps will allow the ground heat pumps to be more attractive in the next future. Geothermal Energy medium temperature: in this case the ATES (Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage) has been investigated. ATES is a particular type of thermal storage which uses water from the subsoil where the groundwater can vary between 15 °C and 130 °C. The extraction and reinjection wells should be sufficiently distant in order to avoid short-circuits. This technology could be used also for low temperature aquifers; in this case the water of the aquifer is used for cooling the condenser during summertime, while it is cooled down in winter time to transfer heat to the evaporator. The wells are used alternatively in order to accumulate a cold storage during winter time and a warm storage during summer time. The work of the present thesis has focused on the thermal influence of the reinjection well on the undisturbed temperature conditions along the aquifer, depending on the thickness of the aquifer. Results of a FEM model have been compared to the analytical solution of various authors (Carslaw and Jaeger, Lauwerier, Ghassemi). The goal is to evaluate the distance between the two wells in order to prevent thermal interference, {{as a function of the}} thickness of the aquifer. Geothermal Energy high temperature: it allows to extract dry and superheated steam without liquid phase (in this case they are called "dominant steam systems") or liquid water mixed with steam (in this case they are called "water-dominated systems"). The usual depth of these systems is between 3 km and 15 km in correspondence of magmatic intrusions. For these systems the thesis has the aim to study the heat exchange between the rock and hot water, considering the variation of the outlet temperature of the water as a function of time. These studies were developed at first considering a single fracture in the rock, then we moving to a more realistic model consisting in a multi rock-fracture. The model proposed in literature based on analytical methods have been compared with a FEM mathematical model. The models have been then applied to a site in the Philippines where experimental data were availabl...|$|R

Instrumental {{methods that}} provide {{an array of}} {{information}} on the chemical composition of engine fuels, lubricants, brake <b>fluids,</b> <b>antifreeze</b> mixtures and other operating substances used in transport are currently being intensively developed. The FTIR spectrometry method allows a multicomponent analysis of their parameters; it has proven useful as a method for routine laboratory and process inspection, it is applied in monitoring contamination of operating substances and monitoring the process of degradation of oil lubricants in operation. Analytical ferrography followed by image analysis combined with raster electron microscopy and EDX analysis belong among methods of disassembly-free tribotechnical diagnostics; based on analysis of the depleted lubricant, they make it possible to assess the mechanism wearing regime, predict emergence of accidental wear, and often also specify the origin of abrasion particles and establish the material composition of the component from which the abrasion originates.

40|$|Secondary working fluids (secondary refrigerants, heat {{transfer}} <b>fluids,</b> <b>antifreezes,</b> brines) {{have long been}} used in various indirect re-frigeration and heat pump systems. Aqueous solutions (water solu-tions) have long been used as single phase (liquid only) secondary working fluids for cooling in supermarkets, ice rinks, heat recovery systems, heat pumps and other applications. However, aqueous solutions are increasingly used also for freezers in supermarkets and other applications in low temperature refrigeration. Of importance when comparing different secondary working fluids for indirect systems are the following basic thermophysical properties: freezing point, density, viscosity, specific heat, and thermal conductivity. Reliable data of these properties are needed to choose suitable fluid and to make technical calculations of an indirect refrigeration or heat pump system. The main intention of this work has been to select thermophysical property data with good or acceptable technical accuracy {{of a number of}} aqueous solutions that can be used by the refrigeration and heat pump industry, rather than focusing on a limited number of property values or scientifically very accurate measuring techniques. A thorough literature search was in view of this made to find the most reliable property values of aqueous solutions. Detailed literature references are given for thermo-physical properties of the following aqueous solutions, without other additives: Ethylene and propylene glycol, ethyl and methyl alcohol, glycerol, ammonia, potassium carbonate, calcium, lithium, magnesium and sodium chlorides as well as potassium acetate and potassium formate. Some laboratory measurements were made of most of the fluid types when literature values were incomplete or deemed unreliable. Methods used are briefly described and results are given. Much of the work was reported on in the Engineering Licentiate Thesis: Thermophysical properties of liquid secondary refrigerants, A Critical Review on Literature References and Laboratory Measure-ments (Melinder 1998 a). That material forms the basis for the charts and tables used in the IIR-publication Thermophysical properties of liquid secondary refrigerants (Melinder, 1997). The present thesis reports on an update made since 1998, including re-view work done on two additional fluids not covered in Melinder (1998 a). The thesis describes how the selection of property values results in tables and charts intended for the industry. Coefficients for poly-nomial equations are generated from these property values using a Matlab program and this material is intended as a useful tool for computer treatment. Aqueous solution of ethyl alcohol is used as example to see how this process is made. This choice of fluid can also be seen as a test of this method, as the basic thermophysical properties of aqueous solutions of ethyl alcohol present more chal-lenges than the other fluids examined. A comparison is made of a few types of aqueous solutions used as secondary working fluids for two types of applications. The first example is bedrock heat pumps and the second is cooling cabinets in a supermarket. An effort is made to see how the additive con-centration affects the thermal performance. Most aqueous solutions used as single-phase secondary fluids can also be used as ice slurry, a fluid consisting of liquid and ice where small ice crystals are produced, usually with some type of ice generator. The ice crystals are then transported to the cooling object from which heat is removed when ice crystals melt. This results in less temperature change in the cooling object and makes it also possible to reduce the volume flow rate and to use smaller pipe dimensions in the system. In order to choose a secondary fluid for ice slurry use and to make correct technical calculations of the ice slurry system {{there is a need to}} examine and evaluate thermo-physical properties and other aspects of ice and of the aqueous solution used. For dimensioning purposes it is of interest to estimate ice mass fraction and enthalpy values and enthalpy-phase diagrams can serve that purpose. This thesis presents enthalpy-phase diagrams made by author that besides isotherms contain lines with ice fraction and lines connecting enthalpies at freezing point and 1, 2, etc. to 10 K below the freezing point curve.
