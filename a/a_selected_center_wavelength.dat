Previous nonlinear spectroscopy work with solution phase bio-molecules has been largely limited to fluorescent compounds. We substantially extend these studies and report on use of THG as a general means of investigating the nonlinear properties of non-fluorescent molecules. At physiologically relevant concentrations, hemoglobin solutions are found to have large resonant TPA cross- sections of about 150 GM. This finding confirms theoretical predictions that the highly conjugated cyclic structure of porphryns may lead to cross-sections of such magnitudes. At some wavelengths we find a {{significant differences between the}} nonlinear properties of hemoglobin in different ligand binding states. This suggests that the nonlinear optical properties of hemoglobin may be used as a functional contrast mechanism to report blood oxygenation in nonlinear laser scanning microscopy. Our spectral measurements on THG in water and benzene are found to be in good agreement with previous single wavelength studies. Our two-photon absorption spectra of rhodamine B and 6 G are in excellent agreement with previous single wavelength TPA cross-sections studies performed on these dyes at similar concentrations. We show that large discrepancies in TPEF based cross-section studies on these dyes is largely due to concentration effect...|$|R

Pharmaceutical companies are discovering increasing numbers of both promiscuous drugs and drug targets. Hence, polypharmacology is now recognized as {{an important aspect of}} drug design. Here, we describe a new and fast way to predict polypharmacological relationships between drug classes quantitatively, which we call Gaussian Ensemble Screening (GES). This approach represents a cluster of molecules with similar spherical harmonic surface shapes as a Gaussian distribution with respect to <b>a</b> <b>selected</b> <b>center</b> molecule. Calculating the Gaussian overlap between pairs of such clusters allows the similarity between drug classes to be calculated analytically without requiring thousands of bootstrap comparisons, as in current promiscuity prediction approaches. We find that such cluster similarity scores also follow a Gaussian distribution. Hence, a cluster similarity score may be transformed into a probability value, or "p-value", in order to quantify the relationships between drug classes. We present results obtained when using the GES approach to predict relationships between drug classes in a subset of the MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR) database.

Books and audio-visual materials selected for use were based on content related to young children's fears. The following null hypothesis was tested:There is no significant difference between the mean posttest scores on the Children's Fear Survey Schedule for: 1. A group of children 3, 4, and 5 years of age in <b>a</b> <b>selected</b> child care <b>center</b> who have received 4 weeks of biweekly sessions of bibliotherapeutic intervention to reduce fears through hearing selected stories read aloud. 2. A group of children 3, 4, and 5 years of age in <b>a</b> <b>selected</b> child care <b>center</b> who have received 4 weeks of biweekly sessions of bibliotherapeutic intervention to reduce fears through an audio-visual mode. 3. A comparison group of children 3, 4, and 5 years of age in <b>a</b> <b>selected</b> child care received no intervention. The sample numbered 65 children who completed both significantly different, thus a one-way analysis of variance was used to test the hypothesis. Findings 1. Results of the posttest (Children's Fear Survey Schedule) indicated a reduction in fear level by children in both bibliotherapeutic intervention strategies. 2. The reduction was most notable in the group receiving bibliotherapy through the audio-only mode. 3. Differences between the audio-only group and the comparison group were statistically significant at the. 05 level of confidence. Children who participated in bibliotherapy through an audio-visual mode also showed a reduction in fear level but not to a significant degree. Children in the comparison group who received no intervention showed an increase in reported fears. Conclusions and RecommendationsIt would appear that there are beneficial effects of reading aloud to children to reduce children's fears. Further study was recommended in the following areas:Development of a more precise instrument, application of the strategies to different age groups, and analysis of results to identify possible differences between gender of subjects.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} <b>center</b> <b>wavelength</b> {{accuracy}} of a Fiber Bragg Grating Sensor {{system that has}} {{a large number of}} sensor elements both as a function of wavelength and as a function of position. Determining the <b>center</b> <b>wavelength</b> of each of the fiber optic sensors is a critical parameter that ultimately determines sensor accuracy. The high density environment can result in degradation of accuracy of the <b>center</b> <b>wavelength</b> measurement. This thesis aims to quantify this measurement error both with theoretical and experimental studies. There are many sensing applications where optical fiber sensors are preferred over electrical sensors, such as {{the oil and gas industry}} where fiber optic sensors are used to monitor wells and pipelines due to their low signal degradation over long distances and immunity to harsh physical environments. Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors in particular have widespread use because of their versatility, measurement sensitivity, and distributed multiplexing abilities. In conventional wavelength multiplexing, up to 50 FBG sensors are spread out over a band of 100 nm, each with a <b>center</b> <b>wavelength</b> difference large enough so that each element can be individually measured. However, numerous sensing applications require several hundred to over a thousand sensors cascaded together on a single fiber. These sensor arrays use a combination of WDM and TDM for measurements, where many FBG sensors with the same <b>center</b> <b>wavelength</b> are separated by a long enough length of fiber so that the reflected signals are separated in time. These Wavelength-to-Time Domain Multiplexing (W-TDM) measurements are enabled by Insight Photonic’s new ‘akinetically’ swept, all-semiconductor laser. This laser is a Vernier-Tuned Distributed Bragg Reflector (VT-DBR) device, capable of rapidly sweeping through different wavelengths without any moving parts. Attributes that make this laser superior to mechanically-swept lasers include: 1) short and long term consistent sweep-sweep reliability, 2) availability at many wavelengths, 3) a narrow linewidth with single longitudinal mode, and 4) the ability to do non-traditional sweep patterns that facilitate measurement of high-density sensor networks. In this thesis, experiments will be performed in the lab with the Insight VT-DBR laser to determine how accurately the <b>center</b> <b>wavelength</b> of a single Fiber Bragg grating can be measured. Experiments will also be performed with two and three FBGs to compare different algorithmic approaches to measurements. The second part of the thesis will simulate both single and multiple FBG sensor environments, comparing the <b>center</b> <b>wavelength</b> measurement accuracy results for different parameters including signal-to-noise ratios, wavelength point density, FBG loss and width, and multiple algorithmic approaches. The results of these experiments and simulations will demonstrate how accurate a FBG sensor system is at particular parameters, which will be useful to those designing a sensor network or performing similar experiments...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{closed-loop}} interrogation technique for multi-point temperature measurement using fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) is presented. The technique uses a broadband light source and n tunable FBGs to interrogate {{an array of}} n FBGs sensors placed along the optical fiber. Each <b>center</b> <b>wavelength</b> of the tunable FBGs is matched with the <b>center</b> <b>wavelength</b> of one FBG sensor placed in the array. The light source directly illuminates the sensor array, {{so that all the}} light reflected from the FBGs enters in the optical circuit through an optical circulator and the reflected spectrum of each sensing FBG illuminates a matched tunable FBG. Because the current generated by the photodiode is proportional to the convolution between the two FBGs profiles (the sensor FBG and the tunable FBG), by controlling the value of the convolution at a fixed value, the <b>center</b> <b>wavelengths</b> of the two FBGs are kept spaced by a constant value.
