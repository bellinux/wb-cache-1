5|$|Although the 77,777 {{copies of}} Advent Pieces: Limited that were {{released}} in Japan sold out {{months in advance}} of the official release date, Last Order received a negative fan response due to changes in content and presentation from the original Final Fantasy VII game, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> the crew working on Crisis Core avoided recreating certain scenes from Last Order.|$|E
5|$|Kyle is a third- then fourth-grade {{student who}} {{commonly}} has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town {{life in his}} fictional hometown of South Park, Colorado. Kyle is distinctive {{as one of the}} few Jewish children on the show, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> he often feels like an outsider amongst the core group of characters. His portrayal in this role is often dealt with satirically, and has elicited both praise and criticism from Jewish viewers.|$|E
5|$|Molluscs {{have been}} and still are an {{important}} food source for anatomically modern humans. However {{there is a risk}} of food poisoning from toxins which can accumulate in certain molluscs under specific conditions, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> many countries have regulations to reduce this risk. Molluscs have, for centuries, also been the source of important luxury goods, notably pearls, mother of pearl, Tyrian purple dye, and sea silk. Their shells have also been used as money in some preindustrial societies.|$|E

50|$|The {{bicolored hawk}} is {{difficult}} to detect due to its shyness <b>and</b> inconspicuousness. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> behaviour, the bicolored hawk may be more common than it seems.|$|R
50|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> {{the railway}} running through private farmland, Gate Keepers are {{assigned}} to Gates NO. 1 <b>and</b> 2. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> a hut is allocated to both gates.|$|R
5|$|The {{island was}} rediscovered and named Ducie Island on 16 March 1791 by Captain Edward Edwards, of , {{who had been}} {{despatched}} from Britain in 1790 to arrest the Bounty mutineers. Edwards named it in honour of Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie, under whom he had served earlier in his career. HMS Pandora turned northwards from Ducie <b>and,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> change of course, Edwards did not sight the other islands of the group. If HMS Pandora had maintained its course, it would eventually have reached Pitcairn Island and found the Bounty mutineers.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{ambulances}} {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a road traffic collision, as these emergencies create people who are likely to be in need of treatment. They are required to gain access to patients as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws. For instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or stop sign as a yield sign ('give way'), or be permitted to break the speed limit. Generally, the priority of the response to the call will be assigned by the dispatcher, but the priority of the return will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in significant danger to life and limb (as determined by triage) require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with passive and active visual and/or audible warnings to alert road users.|$|E
5|$|In 1737, Murray {{acted as}} Counsel for the City of Edinburgh in the {{aftermath}} of the death of Captain John Porteous. In Edinburgh, it was traditional for criminals sentenced to death to be allowed to visit a church near the city jail the Sunday before the execution. Two criminals named Wilson and Robertson took this as an opportunity to escape, and although Wilson did not make it out of the church, Robertson escaped completely. Wilson had been a smuggler who supplied his fellow citizens with goods, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> and the unpopularity of the city guard, public opinion was firmly on his side. Porteous was the captain of the Edinburgh city guard, and angry with Wilson's attempt to escape and aware of the possibility of an attempt to free him. Porteous ordered a guard of 80 men to be placed around the gallows for Wilson's execution. When a man attempted to cut Wilson's body down after the execution, Porteous ordered his troops to fire on the crowd, and seven people were killed. Porteous was initially sentenced to death for murder, and when the execution was delayed, a mob of citizens rushed the city jail and lynched him.|$|E

25|$|Alfalfa, {{like other}} leguminous crops, is a known source of phytoestrogens, {{including}} spinasterol, coumestrol, <b>and</b> coumestan. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> grazing on alfalfa has caused reduced fertility in sheep and in dairy cattle.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the last}} 45 years (3 generations), the {{population}} has declined by approximately 50% due to habitat loss <b>and</b> hunting. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> A. belzebuth is listed as endangered by the IUCN.|$|R
5|$|In 1992, {{the group}} {{performed}} at a music festival {{held by the}} Dakar French Cultural Center, where the French rapper MC Solaar heard their performance and invited the group to open {{for him when he}} debuted in Dakar in October of that year. The rapper was impressed with Positive Black Soul, inviting them to continue performing with him in France. Two years later the group put out its first release, a cassette entitled Boul Falé. The album was followed by more touring in France, as well as in England and Switzerland. In the same year, the Senegalese musician Baaba Maal offered PBS the opportunity to be on his album Firin' in Fouta. Maal was signed to Mango Records <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> recording with him, Positive Black Soul were signed as well. They released their album debut Salaam on Mango Records. After achieving success in Senegal and some abroad, the group continued touring, including 130 performances in 1997. They also began organizing concerts in Dakar and promoting new groups including Daara J and Pee Froiss.|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are also}} {{involved}} in signal transduction through their role {{as the home of}} integral membrane proteins. This is an extremely broad and important class of biomolecule. It is estimated that up to a third of the human proteome may be membrane proteins. Some of these proteins are linked to the exterior of the cell membrane. An example of this is the CD59 protein, which identifies cells as “self” and thus inhibits their destruction by the immune system. The HIV virus evades the immune system in part by grafting these proteins from the host membrane onto its own surface. Alternatively, some membrane proteins penetrate {{all the way through the}} bilayer and serve to relay individual signal events from the outside to the inside of the cell. The most common class of this type of protein is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs are responsible for much of the cell’s ability to sense its surroundings <b>and,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> important role, approximately 40% of all modern drugs are targeted at GPCRs.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Ayyubid emirs of Syria were discredited by Qutuz for {{collaborating with}} the Mongols, but since al-Ashraf Musa {{defected}} and fought alongside the Mamluks at Ain Jalut, {{he was allowed to}} continue his rule over Homs. Al-Mansur of Hama had fought alongside the Mamluks from the start of their conquest <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> Hama continued to be ruled by the Ayyubid descendants of al-Muzaffar Umar. After al-Ashraf Musa's death in 1262, the new Mamluk sultan, Baibars, annexed Homs. The next year, al-Mughith Umar was tricked into surrendering Karak to Baibars and was executed soon after for having previously sided with the Mongols.|$|E
50|$|The {{area around}} Lower Salford was {{originally}} {{settled in the}} early 1700s by farmers from Germany, Switzerland, <b>and</b> Holland. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> most people at the time spoke primarily Pennsylvania Dutch, until the mid 1900s.|$|R

50|$|The {{frequencies}} {{are very}} close to those <b>of</b> WWV, <b>and</b> WWVH. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> RWM is very difficult to receive in North America with simple receivers of low selectivity, due to interference from these said stations.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) accidentally outs her cousin, Randy (Jeffery Self) to {{his family}} at a New Year's Eve party, so he comes {{to live with her}} in New York City. At the same time, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) enters a fake {{relationship}} with actor James Franco, in order to counteract rumors that he is in love with a Japanese body pillow. Jenna feels slighted when she realizes that she wants a real relationship, and encourages James to follow his own passions, resulting in Jenna ending things with him. Later, Liz and Randy go to a nightclub, where Liz runs into James and his pillow. The two get drunk and end up sleeping together. The next morning, at Liz's apartment, Randy is shocked to see James coming out of Liz's bedroom with his body pillow, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> decides to go back home to Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, the {{railroad}} was {{brought before the}} New Jersey Board of Public Utility Commissioners due to an accident on November 28, 1916, at Kingsland station. Passenger train No. 582, a special train for employees of the Canadian Car Company, had near stopped at Kingsland station. The train never left at any defined time, although averaged around 6:30 in the evening. However, around 6:30that evening, Train No. 479 came in twelve minutes late at {{a high rate of}} speed, and as a result could not slow down fast enough to avoid hitting passengers. At that time, the station had no inter-track fencing to prevent crossing of both Boonton Branch tracks, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> people could board trains from either platform. That day the engineer of Train No. 479 was unable to see the platform or the special train, and {{due to the lack of}} signals, had no information until the train knowing anything until the train left the west portal of Kingsland Tunnel. However, signals were set for west-bound trains if problems were to occur. After the accident, the Board requested the Lackawanna to install a westbound signal to prevent further accidents, while the Canadian Car Company moved its boarding to the company's rail siding.|$|E
5|$|The older houses relied {{mainly on}} heating from open coal fires, {{which led to}} {{problems}} with smog (in 1962, 24 deaths in Leeds were attributed to this), although this problem was partially relieved in the 1950s {{with the introduction of}} the Clean Air Act 1956. Although a slum clearance scheme was under way in the 1930s, it took until after the Second World War, for the scheme to get well under way. In the 1950s, the largest social housing project began with the building of the Seacroft Estate. Seacroft was planned at the time to be a 'Satellite town within the city limits'. The building of new council estates was most prevalent in the city's east end <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> the city expanded much further East {{in the latter part of}} the 20th century then it did any other direction. The Langbar Gardens Estate (completed 1966) in Swarcliffe lay right on the eastern fringes of the city sprawl until it was demolished in the early 21st century, including the high-profile implosions of Langbar Towers, Langbar Grange and Ash Tree Grange. By the 1960s and 1970s land for social housing was becoming scarcer and the council started looking towards building 'high rise', with such estates as Cottingley sporting prominent tower blocks. By the 1970s less land was available for such developments and the particularly large estates were becoming unpopular, however faced with a need for a larger social housing stock, Leeds City Council built smaller estates such as Holt Park (in partnership with Norman Ashton), replaced the prefabricated 'war houses' in Cottingley with newer prefabs and redeveloped areas such as Beckhill in Meanwood.|$|E
50|$|The Danish Spitz is {{compatible}} with other dogs, cats, and most livestock. They are particularly valued for their high level of sociability towards people, <b>and</b> calmness. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> they are widely recommended as a family dog.|$|R
50|$|Many {{research}} areas see increasingly {{large numbers}} of variables in only few samples. The low sample to variable ratio creates problems known as multicollinearity <b>and</b> singularity. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> most traditional multivariate statistical methods cannot be applied.|$|R
50|$|The tramway passed beneath two low bridges at Parkgate <b>and</b> Swinton. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> {{the sixteen}} Mexborough trams and the Rotherham trams used for through joint service {{to and from}} the town were fitted with low-height top covers.|$|R
5|$|The {{stone was}} already in a ruined state when Rogberg {{depicted}} the stone in 1763. Rogberg noted {{that it had been}} used as a bridge across a brook <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> the runes had been worn down so much that most of them were virtually illegible, a statement that is contradicted by later depictions. Since the runestone had passed unnoticed by the runologists of the 17th century, it is likely that it was used as a bridge. In a traveller's journal written in 1792 by Hilfeling, the bottom part of the stone is depicted for the first time, though the artist {{does not appear to have}} realised that the two parts belonged together. In 1822, Liljegren arrived to depict it. A surviving yet unsigned drawing is attributed to Liljegren (see illustration). In 1922, the runologist Kinander learnt from a local farmer that some 40 years earlier, the runestone had been seen walled into a bridge that was part of the country road, and the inscription had been upwards. Someone had decided to remove the runestone from the bridge and put it beside the road. Kinander wanted to see the stone and was shown a large worn down stone in the garden of Eriksstad. However, according to Kinander it was not possible to find any remaining runes on what was supposed to be the runestone.|$|E
25|$|High-dose (10mg/day) NET {{has been}} {{associated}} with hepatic veno-occlusive disease, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> adverse effect, NET should not be given to patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, as it {{has been associated}} with substantially lower one-year survival post-transplantation.|$|E
25|$|Jeremy, {{portrayed by}} Jonathan Taylor Thomas (2004), is Bridget's tutor and {{eventual}} boyfriend. He {{is considered a}} nerd at school, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> Bridget at first denies her interest in him by saying it was only because he was her tutor.|$|E
50|$|Not {{all people}} truly {{satisfied}} with their lives and live without bitterness <b>and</b> grief. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> bitterness <b>and</b> grief, people suffer and eventually they have grudge feeling toward each other. Therefore, more conflict and more lethal energy generated.|$|R
50|$|In {{some parts}} of {{southern}} Appalachia, green twigs from the eastern redbud are used as seasoning for wild game such as venison <b>and</b> opossum. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> in these mountain areas the eastern redbud is sometimes known as the spicewood tree.|$|R
50|$|In 1936, Jews {{were banned}} from all {{professional}} jobs, effectively {{preventing them from}} exerting any influence in education, politics, higher education <b>and</b> industry. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> {{there was nothing to}} stop the anti-Jewish actions which spread across the Nazi-German economy.|$|R
25|$|Not all {{mushrooms}} expand overnight; some grow {{very slowly}} and add tissue to their fruitbodies by growing from {{the edges of}} the colony or by inserting hyphae. For example, Pleurotus nebrodensis grows slowly, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> combined with human collection, it is now critically endangered.|$|E
25|$|The {{support of}} the British {{newspaper}} became {{a new source of}} problems for Frederick and Victoria. The article contained everyday details suggesting that Vicky revealed certain confidential information to the press.

25|$|Jamaica {{lies in the}} {{hurricane}} belt of the Atlantic Ocean <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> the island sometimes suffers significant storm damage. Hurricanes Charlie and Gilbert hit Jamaica directly in 1951 and 1988, respectively, causing major damage and many deaths. In the 2000s (decade), hurricanes Ivan, Dean, and Gustav also brought severe weather to the island.|$|E
