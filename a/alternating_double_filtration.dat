40|$|Anti-GBM nephritis is an {{autoimmune}} disorder charac-terized by rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and {{the presence}} of circulating anti-glomerular basement mem-brane (anti-GBM) antibodies. If accompanied by pulmon-ary hemorrhage, this disease is often called Goodpasture’s syndrome, with a high mortality rate [1, 2]. Treatment consists of immunosuppressive agents and removal of cir-culating antibodies. Extracorporeal removal of anti-GBM antibody, by, for example, plasmapheresis or immunoad-sorption (IA) is an effective treatment for Goodpasture’s syndrome.

The evaluation covered the number of grains per 1 mm 2 of the sample surface area, the average area of grains and the shape index, hardness HB, tensile strength and resistance to high temperature creep. The results indicate the possibility of controlling the stereological parameters of macrostructure through application of several variants of the modification, controlling in this way also different low- and high-temperature properties.

A pesquisa em questão utilizou o sistema de tratamento por dupla filtração como filtração direta: filtro ascendente de lavagem contínua e filtro ascendente convencional, com taxa de filtração constante de 150 m³/m². dia, objetivando, principalmente, a remoção de microalgas e de cianobactérias. O seguinte tratamento foi testado: adição de coagulante na entrada do filtro de lavagem contínua e adição de coagulante na entrada do filtro ascendente convencional. O sistema de dupla filtração estudado se mostrou eficiente para a remoção de clorofila a, remoção de cerca de 96 %, e para a remoção de cianobactérias, remoção final de 75 %; e vantajoso quanto aos serviços operacionais, tendo em vista que diminui as lavagens do segundo filtro, permitindo obter carreira de filtração de até 338 h e um grande aumento no tratamento efetivo de água.
