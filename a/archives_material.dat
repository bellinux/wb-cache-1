This {{dissertation}} {{attempts to}} investigate {{issues related to}} requirements that the archives’ information systems should apply in order to effectively support the historical research. The requirements {{are based on the}} general rules of the historical research methodology, the practices used by the historians during their research and the studies related to the effectiveness of the several methods of information recovery and visualization in the historical archives. Based on historical research methodology, the general rules and the practices that are used by the historians during their research, a methodology for the ontologies ’ development has been developed. These ontologies are used in the management of the historical <b>archives</b> <b>material.</b> The developed methodology is general and takes into consideration not only the methodological historical research rules but also the special characteristics of each archive. The developed methodology will be used at any historical archive environment, while the usage of a number of heuristics which will be used on the ontologically managed knowledge, will assist the historians on the monitoring of the ontologies evolution throughout time, by making easier the historical research conduct and the modulation of the historical conclusions...|$|E

Factor XIII, fibrin stabilizing factor, stabilizes the clot for blood coagulation and is also responsible for connective tissue organization in healing and tissue repair. FXIIIa has an important role {{during the process of}} fibrosis in various lesions, so we conducted a study to find its role in radicular cyst. Study Design: 10 cases of radicular cyst, reported in our hospital were selected. Clinical and follow up data of those cases were collected from the <b>archives.</b> <b>Material</b> and Methods: Histochemical analysis with Masson’s trichrome was done to differentiate the three layers of radicular cyst. Immunocytochemical staining for distribution of factor XIIIa was carried out. Stained slides were examined under high power. After counting cell, data was analysed statistically. Results: Positive reaction for Factor XIIIa was observed in certain connective tissue cells in all the layers of radicular cysts. FXIIIa containing cells were numerous in intermediate layer as compared to outer fibrous layer. FXIIIa containing cells and fibrosis was increased in case of radiographically well circumscribed lesion than the diffuse lesion. It can be concluded that factor XIIIa containing cells and collagenous components in radicular cyst {{play an important role in}} fibrosis and is also correlated with healing of the lesion...|$|E
40|$|Why do states repress? Why are {{civil liberties}} curtailed? Explorations of these {{questions}} have departed from the assumption that security concerns motivate decisions that lead to repressive outcomes. If the state is challenged, it will repress. A state, it is assumed, must "strike a balance" between security and liberty. But what if those assumptions are flawed? If the decisions behind politically repressive outcomes are not always motivated by security challenges to the state, then we must ask {{a different set of}} questions about what can motivate state behavior and repression. This study examines the validity of these assumptions. A survey of cases of repressive episodes in the United States, using both primary and secondary sources, reveals that the decisions behind enacting repressive measures is not as straightforward as these assumptions would have it seem. A unique case, situated both contextually and historically by the preceding survey, is then explored in depth using data that is rarely available to shed a new degree of light on a decision making process. This data is overwhelming primary source information and includes declassified material from a variety of <b>archives,</b> <b>material</b> obtained from Freedom of Information Act Requests, as well as uniquely revelatory audio evidence that has only recently been made publicly available. After reviewing the case I argue that enough evidence exists to suggest the main assumptions of the repression and civil liberties literature fails to encompass all motivating factors behind repressive outcomes and a deeper understanding of how other factors can lead to repressive outcomes is needed...|$|E
40|$|The Personnel Archives are MDC’s project {{initiated}} {{in the beginning}} of 2002 with the aim of collecting relevant documents and information created through the work of prominent museum professionals, and includes biographical and bibliographical information, books, monographs, journals, masters’ and doctors’ theses, studies, offprints, projects, letters, photographs, video and audio recordings, CDs and other documents. The aims are the following: - the preservation of permanent values of the intangible cultural heritage, - the enrichment of existing holdings: archives, libraries, photographic archives, video-archives, CD-archives and so on. Why? The formation of Personnel Archives enriches the cultural heritage, and makes the work of future museum professionals easier with respect to research, drawing up bibliographies, monographs of museum institutions and similar publications. Information from the Personnel Archives are primarily used for museological purposes. Who is represented? All signiÞ cant museum professionals and art historians who have made a mark through their work, professional knowledge, museum and cultural programmes, successes at home and abroad and who have contributed to the promotion of the profession and the milieu in which they worked. The minimum age requirement for those represented in the Personnel Archives is 60. Means of work: in stages. The first stage: Explaining the project to the interviewee and setting a date for the interview Second stage: Filling out the questionnaire of the Personnel Archives Third stage: Visit to the interviewee in order to record the interview and take photographs (recording using a camera), as well as to gather <b>archives</b> <b>material.</b> Fourth stage (ofÞ ce work) : organising, taking stock of the materials gathered in the Þ eld and cataloguing it. Duplicates of the recorded material sent to the interviewee for authorization. Note: We need to receive permission that the gathered information can be used for museological needs and publications. The gathered archival material has the same importance as other archives materials and is to be kept in a space that meets the required conditions for keeping and preserving archival materials...|$|E

40|$|Public History : a {{textbook}} of practice' is {{a guide to}} the many challenges historians face while teaching, learning, and practicing public history. Historians can play a dynamic and essential role in contributing to public understanding of the past, and those who work in historic preservation, in museums and archives, in government agencies, as consultants, as oral historians, or who manage crowdsourcing projects need very specific skills. This book links theory and practice and provides students and practitioners with the tools to do public history {{in a wide range of}} settings. The text engages throughout with key issues such as public participation, digital tools and media, and the internationalization of public history. Part One focuses on public history sources, and offers an overview of the creation, collection, management, and preservation of public history materials (<b>archives,</b> <b>material</b> culture, oral materials, or digital sources). Chapters cover sites and institutions such as archival repositories and museums, historic buildings and structures, and different practices such as collection management, preservation (archives, objects, sounds, moving images, buildings, sites, and landscape), oral history, and genealogy. Part Two deals with the different ways in which public historians can produce historical narratives through different media (including exhibitions, film, writing, and digital tools). The last part explores the challenges and ethical issues that public historians will encounter when working with different communities and institutions. Either in public history methods courses or as a resource for practicing public historians, this book lays the groundwork for making meaningful connections between historical sources and popular audiences. -	Introduction: Historians Public Roles and Practices - PART I: Collecting, Managing, and Preserving the Past.

40|$|AbstractFredrik Skott, Folkets minnen. Traditionsinsamling i idé och praktik 1919 1964. (Avhandlingar från Historiska institutionen i Göteborg 53). 386 pages. Written in Swedish with an English Summary (The Popular Memory. Folklore Collecting in Theory and Practice, 1919 1964). Institutet för språk och folkminnen, Dialekt-, ortnamns- och folkminnesarkivet i Göteborg, Göteborg, 2008. In {{this thesis}} I analyse the popular images that the {{folklore}} collections communicate and the ideas behind the selection principles governing their construction. My overarching {{aim is to}} contribute to {{a deeper understanding of the}} folklore <b>archives</b> <b>material</b> and their governing processes during the period 1919 1964. The point of departure is present-day views of folklore material as a) an expression of politically conservative ideology and nationalism, b) reflecting the archive staff s objective ideas about the past, and c) an expression of nostalgia and the idealisation of the past. In the study I examine all these from a critical point of view. Apart from examining folklore collections from a national policy point of view, I also consider the archive personnel s and collectors view and use of folklore. Throughout my study I point to Swedish folklore collecting as a very heterogeneous project. Several perceptions of an ideal recording were included in the work. Struggles relating to the definition of the people, their recollections and the content of the archives were rife. Just as criticism could be directed towards that period through the documentation of the past, folklore could also be exploited to build the future or demonstrating (the need for) societal development. Aspects of the past were sometimes accentuated as contemporary ideals, and in part the collections should be regarded as a balancing of the books of peasant culture. The collecting of folklore cannot be regarded as a politically conservative project; if anything they represented the politically radical left s view of a more popular, more peaceable and more democratic historiography. In practical terms the recorders were also given a rather free hand to transfer their own images of the past to the future. The folklore collections can thus hardly be regarded as the elite s counterparts. It is rather the collectors and their informants picture of the past that is reflected in the folklore collections; an idea that corresponded with the earlier 20 th century political left s wishes for a more popular historiography.

40|$|The primary aim of {{this book}} is to {{encourage}} and facilitate {{the study of history}} of towns and municipalities. Various forms of social science research on Swedish local authorities might derive advantage from this book. The staff of local archives and prospective amateur researcher, for example among the members of local folklore society, also ought to enjoy the content of this book. Another purpose of the publication is to suggest continuous comparative studies, where Swedish municipalities are compared in different ways. The number of Swedish municipalities was considerably reduced {{during the second half of}} the 20 th century. For that reason it is now the proper time to pursue comparative studies of municipalities which no longer exist and are replaced by greater administrative units. Too much of the previous research has been done as case studies of one singular rural district. It should be emphasized that many local investigations have been done by amateur researcher who have not always used a reliable scholarly scientific course of action. The source material for the proposed inquiries should mostly be taken from the Swedish municipal archives. In principle all the 290 present municipalities have their own archives, which means that there is a large supply of source material in the whole country. This is one of the greatest advantages of working with this type of historical source material. In the <b>archives</b> <b>material</b> is stored from the introduction of the current standard of municipality in 1863 and on. It deals thus with the period of more than 140 years during which the Swedish society has changed dramatically. Local material from towns and rural districts concerning the time up to 1862 is normally found in the national provincial record offices, so it is not always easily accessible from a geographical point of view. The book has been divided into a number of thematic fields, such as municipal divisions, local politics, the role of women in local politics, municipal finances and economic expansion, social welfare, educational systems, environmental issues, health care, fire protection the technical sector and cultural and recreational activities. This grouping means, that strictly speaking it is enough to read the sphere in which you show a keen interest, except the two introductory chapters, considering comprehensive facts in the field of municipal history. Each thematic field is then regularly divided into four items, background and earlier research, proposals for future research, limits of interpretation and source material. This order has not been used earlier, and the footnotes should give comparatively many references to other works which could be useful. Key words: source material, archives, municipalities, local politics...|$|E

40|$|A tese propõe um encontro da trilogia pornográfica da escritora brasileira Hilda Hilst com o pesquisador, e decidiu-se pela forma do ensaio. A trilogia, composta pelos livros O Caderno Rosa de Lori Lamby (1990), Cartas de um Sedutor (1991) e Contos d’escárnio/Textos Grotescos (1992) apresentam uma mudança na trajetória da escritora, que anuncia na passagem para a escrita pornográfica, uma desistência da “literatura séria” e, por fim, entre os anos 1998 - 2004, a escritora assume um novo discurso: a desistência da literatura, quando declara publicamente: “não tenho mais nada a dizer”. Para {{investigar}} esses períodos, foi feita uma imersão nos arquivos pessoais da escritora, além da leitura das obras, seguindo a proposição de Didi-Huberman sobre as imagens: o regime da imagem e da imaginação é um local de luta política, principalmente aquelas imagens que portam memórias e têm um poder de transmitir algo de um tempo que se passou. O confronto de diferentes temporalidades se dá como uma estratégia de análise do material de arquivo, uma vez que a hipótese da tese é que, quando Hilda Hilst se “sente livre para fracassar”, acontece junto uma mudança de formato no uso do humor em sua literatura. Através de ferramentas teóricas do campo da psicanálise, da arte, da literatura e da crítica, a pesquisa investiga as noções de erótico, pornográfico e obsceno que compõe o universo da escritora, junto dos seguintes eixos de análise: problematização de imagem, escrita, arquivo, sobrevivência e do realismo grotesco como estratégia para o risível. O método utilizado foi o ensaio, com o objetivo de desenvolver uma pesquisa poética no processo de trabalho. A escrita hilstiana desse período tem por objetivo acordar o leitor com um soco, e aqui, acabou por acertá-lo em cheio. Desse choque se operou uma queda no espaço e uma desestabilização. Diante desta literatura, a tese se constituiu como um percurso de investigação da queda, propondo “Os estudos da gravidade - oscilações entre o peso e a leveza”, como resultados da pesquisa poética. The thesis {{proposes a}} meeting between the Hilda Hilst’s pornography trilogy and the researcher in the essay form. The trilogy is composed by the books “The Pink Book of Lori Lamby (1990) ”, “Letters of a seductive (1991) ” e “Mockery Short Story/Grotesque Writing (1992) ” presenting {{a change in the}} author’s trajectory, which is announced in the route to the pornography writings, a called forsake of the “serious literature”, and lastly, between the years 1998 – 2004, the writer assumes a new speech; the forsake of literature, when she declares publicly: “I have nothing else to say”. To investigate these periods of time, an immersion work was made in the personal archives of the author, besides the reading of the author’s works, followed by the proposition of Didi- Huberman about the images: the image system of imagination is a place of political fight mainly in those images that carry memories and have the strength to transmit something of a lost time. The confrontation of different times is an analyses strategy of the <b>archives</b> <b>material,</b> once the thesis hypothesis is that when Hilda Hilst “feels free to fail” occurs together a change of the format in the use of humor in her literature. By the theoretical tools of the psychoanalyses field, the art, the literature and the critic, the research investigates the concepts of erotic, pornography and obscene, that composes the authors universe, along with the following analysis axes: questioning of image, writing, archive, survival and the grotesque realism as a strategy for the laughable. The method was the essay as an objective to develop a poetic research in the work progress. The hilstian writing of this period has as an objective wake up the reader with a punch, and here in this work has just hit her (the author Hilda) in the face. From this shock, a falling into the space and a destabilization operated. Thereby having in mind this literature, the thesis was built as a route in the investigation of fall, proposing The studies of gravity - fluctuation between the weight and lightness, as the results of this poetic research...|$|E
