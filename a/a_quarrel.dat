5|$|Despite {{a convincing}} victory at Killiecrankie, his army took heavy losses and Dundee himself was killed. Without his {{leadership}} and divided by <b>a</b> <b>quarrel</b> between the leaders {{that led to}} a significant segment of the survivors leaving, the remaining Jacobite force was defeated in August at the Battle of Dunkeld, by a newly raised government regiment of Cameronians. The last remnants surrendered after the Battle of Cromdale in Strathspey on 1 May 1690, ending this phase of Jacobite resistance in Scotland.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to history paintings Matejko made also numerous portraits. Among others: portraits of Jagiellonian University rectors Józef Szujski and Stanisław Tarnowski, and numerous portraits {{of family and}} friends, including Wife in the wedding dress ("Żona w sukni ślubnej") (1865, destroyed by his wife during <b>a</b> <b>quarrel</b> and recreated in 1879) and a self-portrait (1892). Altogether Matejko authored 320 oil paintings and several thousands drawings and watercolors. He also designed the polychrome in St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków (1889–1891).|$|E
5|$|Kings was {{recorded}} by the Opies as common in eastern England. The English Dialect Dictionary recorded much {{the same in the}} nineteenth century. The earliest recorded instance the Opies found was in Sternberg's 1851 Dialect of Northamptonshire. Queens is recorded as used in the kings area, sometimes as an alternative and sometimes as indicating readiness to restart the game. Kings truce is found in Thomas Dekker's The Honest Whore, Part One (II,i), which appeared in 1604. The term is used in the play to halt <b>a</b> <b>quarrel.</b>|$|E

Arriving in New York City on 7 December 1914, he entered Augsburg College, Minneapolis, in September 1916, and graduated with his Bachelor of Arts degree in May 1918.|$|E

Besides, it had no dignity, and <b>a</b> lover's <b>quarrel</b> always has. <b>A</b> lover's <b>quarrel</b> always springs from a more serious cause, and has an air of romantic tragedy.

5|$|A new {{fleet and}} army was raised and built under Ali's leadership, and on 31 October 1831, his son Ibrahim Pasha {{launched}} {{an invasion of}} Syria, which initiated the First Egyptian–Ottoman War. For the sake of international appearances, the pretext for the expedition was <b>a</b> <b>quarrel</b> with Abdullah Pasha of Acre. Ali alleged that 6,000 fellahin (peasants or agricultural laborer) had fled to Acre to escape the Egyptian draft, corvée, and taxes, and he demanded their return. Ibrahim Pasha advanced through Palestine, occupying Haifa in December 1831, and then using the city as his primary military base.|$|E
5|$|Basil II was at {{that time}} in the eastern provinces of his empire, {{wintering}} on the plain of Tarsus following his campaign against the Fatimid dynasty in Syria. On hearing of David’s death he marched north-eastward to claim the lands David had promised to the emperor. The local Georgian and Armenian nobility submitted without any serious resistance. The only notable incident occurred when <b>a</b> <b>quarrel</b> between a Georgian soldier and a Varangian Guardsman over a bale of hay developed into a major fight, involving 6,000 Varangians and taking the lives of thirty Georgian high-ranking nobles.|$|E
5|$|In 580 or 581, Mundhir {{participated in}} an {{unsuccessful}} campaign against the Persian capital, Ctesiphon, alongside the Byzantine general (and future emperor) Maurice. The failure of the campaign led to <b>a</b> <b>quarrel</b> between the two and Maurice accused Mundhir of treason. Byzantine agents captured Mundhir, who was brought to Constantinople but never faced trial. His arrest provoked an uprising among the Ghassanids under Mundhir's son al-Nu'man VI. When Maurice ascended the throne in 582, Mundhir was exiled to Sicily although, according to one source, {{he was allowed to}} return to his homeland after Maurice's overthrow in 602.|$|E

Filming for Mars Attacks! ended on June 1, 1996. The film score was written/composed by Burton's regular Danny Elfman, to whom Burton was reconciled after <b>a</b> <b>quarrel</b> occurred during The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), for which they did not co-operate in producing Ed Wood (1994). Elfman {{enlisted the help of}} Oingo Boingo lead guitarist Steve Bartek to help arrange the compositions for the orchestra.|$|E
5|$|Some {{years after}} the events in Tarifa, <b>a</b> <b>quarrel</b> erupted between the Marinids and the Nasrids, in 1306. The Nasrids {{promptly}} sponsored the rebellion of Uthman ibn Idris, a pretender to the Marinid throne in Morocco. Uthman was landed by a Nasrid force in Ceuta, and quickly carved out an enclave. The rebels continued to receive support across the strait from the Nasrid garrisons. It is believed that the Marinid sultan Abu al-Rabi Sulayman, unable to dislodge the rebel from Ceuta, intrigued with the Castilians, whose truce with Granada was about to expire, encouraging them to take Algeciras and Gibraltar and cut the rebel off. The first siege of Gibraltar was a side-operation of the main Castilian siege of Algeciras in 1309–10.|$|E

5|$|The oral {{legends and}} texts {{initiate}} {{a process of}} Sanskritization of the folk deity Khandoba by elevating him to the classical Hindu god Shiva; his two principal wives Mhalsa and Banai are equated to Parvati and Ganga. Banai {{does not appear in}} the Sanskrit Malhari Mahatmya, the main scripture related to Khandoba, however it mentions Ganga arriving from heaven. Banai (Ganga) has <b>a</b> <b>quarrel</b> with Mhalsa (Parvati), ultimately ending with the message that both are the same. Some Dhangars consider Banai also to be a form of Parvati.|$|E
5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>quarrel</b> with Barkis, {{and realizing}} {{he was only}} after her {{supposed}} wealth, Victoria follows the procession of dead to the church. Emily notices Victoria and realizes that she is denying Victoria her chance at happiness {{the same way it}} was stolen from her. She stops Victor from drinking the poison and reunites him with Victoria. Barkis interrupts them, and Emily recognizes him as her former fiance, who is revealed {{to be the one who}} murdered her for her dowry. Barkis tries to kidnap Victoria at sword point, but Victor stops him and the two men duel; the dead townspeople are unable to interfere with the affairs of the living. Emily intercedes to save Victor, and Barkis mockingly proposes a toast to Emily, unknowingly drinking the cup of poison. The dead, able to intercede upon Barkis's death, eagerly take retribution against him by dragging him to the underworld where he will atone for his crimes. Victoria, now a widow, is once again able to marry Victor.|$|E
5|$|Cabral {{was later}} passed over, {{possibly}} {{as a result}} of <b>a</b> <b>quarrel</b> with Manuel I, when a new fleet was assembled to establish a more robust presence in India. Having lost favor with the King, he retired to a private life of which few records survive. His accomplishments slipped mostly into obscurity for more than 300 years. Decades after Brazil's independence from Portugal in the 19th century, Cabral's reputation began to be rehabilitated by Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Historians have long argued whether Cabral was Brazil's discoverer, and whether the discovery was accidental or intentional. The first question has been settled by the observation that the few, cursory encounters by explorers before him were barely noticed at the time and contributed nothing to the future development and history of the land which would become Brazil, the sole Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas. On the second question, no definite consensus has been formed, and the intentional discovery hypothesis lacks solid proof. Nevertheless, although he was overshadowed by contemporary explorers, Cabral today is regarded as a major figure of the Age of Discovery.|$|E

5|$|He {{was educated}} at Harrow where, {{notwithstanding}} {{the fears of}} his family that a childhood head injury caused by a dangerous fall from a horse had seriously damaged his intellect, he showed aptitude in Greek and Latin. He made good academic progress, but after he had settled <b>a</b> <b>quarrel</b> with another pupil by an organised fist-fight, his father removed him from the school. (Fist fights were tolerated at Harrow: {{it was the fact}} of Brudenell's receiving punishment for unauthorised absence while having a broken bone in his hand attended to by a London surgeon that had annoyed the earl.) He was subsequently educated at home. Here, as the only son among seven sisters, he developed into something of a spoilt child, accustomed to getting his own way. This is seen as a cause of his arrogance and stubbornness in later life.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Dom PedroI's abdication in 1831, a regency created to govern Brazil during the minority of the former Emperor's son, Dom PedroII, soon dissolved into chaos. Paraná formed a political party in 1837 that {{became known as the}} Reactionary Party, which evolved into the Party of Order in the early 1840s and in the mid-1850s into the Conservative Party. He and his party's stalwart and unconditional defence of constitutional order allowed the country to move beyond a regency plagued by factious disputes and rebellions that might easily have led to a dictatorship. Appointed president of Rio de Janeiro Province in 1841, Paraná helped put down a rebellion headed by the opposition Liberal Party the following year. Also in 1842, he was elected senator for Minas Gerais and appointed by PedroII to the Council of State. In 1843, he became the de facto first president (prime minister) of the Council of Ministers, but resigned after <b>a</b> <b>quarrel</b> with the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Lancaster {{spent the}} 1350s {{intermittently}} campaigning and negotiating peace treaties with the French.

It was here that <b>a</b> <b>quarrel</b> with Otto, Duke of Brunswick, almost led to a duel between the two men, narrowly averted by the intervention of the French king, John II. In the later half of the decade campaigning in France resumed. After a chevauchée in Normandy in 1356 and the siege of Rennes in 1358, Lancaster participated in the last great offensive of {{the first phase of the}} Hundred Years' War: the Rheims campaign of 1359–1360. Then he was appointed principal negotiator for the Treaty of Brétigny, where the English achieved very favourable terms.|$|E
