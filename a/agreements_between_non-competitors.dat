This is called determining the <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> methods. In this paper, we will first discuss various ways to determine the <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> methods to measure continuous variables, including the t test, the correlation coefficient and the Bland-Altman plot. In the second part, we will discuss methods to determine the <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> categorical variables, like the chi(2) test and Cohen's kappa.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) mammographic density {{categories}} {{are associated with}} considerable interobserver variability. Automated methods of measuring volumetric breast density may reduce variability and be valuable in risk and mammographic screening stratification. Our objective was to assess agreement of mammographic density by a volumetric method with the radiologists' classification. METHODS: Eight thousand seven hundred and eighty-two examinations from the Malmö Breast Tomosynthesis Screening Trial were classified according to BI-RADS, 4 th Edition. Volumetric breast density was assessed using automated software for 8433 examinations. <b>Agreement</b> <b>between</b> volumetric breast density and BI-RADS was descriptively analyzed. <b>Agreement</b> <b>between</b> radiologists and between categorical volumetric density and BI-RADS was calculated, rendering kappa values. RESULTS: The observed <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> BI-RADS scores of different radiologists was 80. 9 % [kappa 0. 77 (0. 76 - 0. 79) ]. A spread of volumetric breast density for each BI-RADS category was seen. The observed <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> categorical volumetric density and BI-RADS scores was 57. 1 % [kappa 0. 55 (0. 53 - 0. 56) ]. CONCLUSIONS: There was moderate <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> volumetric density and BI-RADS scores from European radiologists indicating that radiologists evaluate mammographic density differently than software. The automated method may be a robust and valuable tool; however, differences in interpretation between radiologists and software require further investigation. KEY POINTS: • <b>Agreement</b> <b>between</b> qualitative and software density measurements has not been frequently studied. • There was substantial <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> different radiologists´ qualitative density assessments. • There was moderate <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> software and radiologists' density assessments. • Differences in interpretation between software and radiologists require further investigation...|$|R

40|$|Background: Accurate {{diagnosis}} of orofacial tumours is important as this determines the treatment options {{as well as}} the eventual treatment outcome. <b>Agreement</b> <b>between</b> clinical and histopathological diagnosis becomes important in this regard. Aims: The aim was to determine the level of <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> clinical and histopathology {{diagnosis of}} orofa cial lesions. Method: This is a retrospective study of all histopathology reports seen at KATH maxillofacial unit. Thedata collected included, clinical diagnosis and histological diagnosis. Results: A total of 567 histopathology reports were evaluated. The percentage of <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> clinical and histopathological diagnosis was 62. 8 %. Conclusion: The <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> clinical and histopathological diagnosis was high. However clinicians cannot rely on only the clinical diagnosis in managing patients. </p...|$|R
