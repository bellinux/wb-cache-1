5|$|After Jesus' death, his {{followers}} said {{he rose from}} the dead, although exact details of their experiences are unclear. Some of those {{who claimed to have}} witnessed Jesus' resurrection later died for their belief, which indicates that their beliefs were likely genuine. According to Sanders, the Gospel reports contradict each other, which, according to him, suggests competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate fraud. On the other hand, L. Michael White suggests that inconsistencies in the Gospels reflect differences in the <b>agendas</b> <b>of</b> their unknown authors. The followers of Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|However, much of {{the blame}} for the decay and ruinous state of {{preservation}} of so many palazzi must fall not just on owners unwilling to accept change, but the political <b>agendas</b> <b>of</b> successive socialist governments. Some of the finest Baroque villas and palazzi, including the Palermo palace of the Prince of Lampedusa, are still in ruins following the United States bombing raids of 1943. In many cases, no attempt has been made to restore or even secure them. Those that survived the raids in good repair are often sub-divided into offices or apartments, their Baroque interiors dismantled, divided, and sold.|$|E
5|$|Weir had two {{significant}} advantages in {{his return to}} a civilian career. Firstly, he was repatriated well before most servicemen and, secondly, South Australia had implemented a policy of preferment of returned servicemen for government employment. These circumstances helped him gain appointment as the first South Australian Public Service Commissioner in 1916. Weir was not suited to this role, being unable to navigate the competing personal and political <b>agendas</b> <b>of</b> senior public servants and politicians, and was soon sidelined. In 1925, legislative changes {{made it possible for}} the government to replace Weir, and this took place in 1930. In the last year-and-a-half before his retirement in 1931, Weir was the chairman of both the Central Board of Health and the Public Relief Board, excelling at the latter.|$|E

25|$|The {{political}} {{atmosphere in}} Málaga was contentious {{in the period}} between {{the fall of the}} dictatorship and the national elections in April 1931. For the republicans in Málaga it was a period of reorganisation, assimilation with other groups, and political activity in cooperation with the socialists. At the same time, the divergent <b>agendas</b> <b>of</b> Málaga's monarchist factions were an obstacle to finding a candidate to represent their interests. Meanwhile, the anarchist CNT and the Communist Party (PCE) organised social protests and strikes against the difficult conditions suffered by the working class.|$|E

Hindutva political demands include revoking Article 370 of the Constitution that grants a special semi-autonomous status to the Muslim-majority state of Kashmir, adopting a uniform civil code, thus ending a special legal framework for Muslims. These particular demands are based upon ending laws that Hindu nationalists consider as offering special treatment to Muslims.|$|E

25|$|However, by 1980, the Australian Democrats had {{employed}} the postal-ballot method at both national at state levels {{to develop an}} extensive body of written policy covering not only the political <b>agendas</b> <b>of</b> the day but also innovative and far-sighted policies for environmental and economic sustainability, water and energy conservation, e.g., through development of alternative energy sources, expanded public transport, etc. To the community's growing concerns about human rights, the Australian Democrats added finely detailed policies on animal welfare and species preservation.

25|$|Throughout {{the first}} half of the 20th century, Seattle's Central {{waterfront}} was the bustling center of one of North America's major ports. The needs of the waterfront created a district of light industrial uses and workingmen's hotels. The waterfront was a focus of the conflicting <b>agendas</b> <b>of</b> big business, radical labor unionists such as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), Populists, and middle-class Progressive reformers such as the Municipal Ownership League led by George Cotterill. The Progressives achieved one of their most cherished goals when the Port of Seattle, the first municipal corporation in the United States, was established in 1911, with elected port commissioners. Despite that victory, for the next several decades and even, to a lesser extent, today, much of the Central Waterfront remained in private hands.|$|E
25|$|On 28 April 1952, Japan regained {{its status}} as a {{sovereign}} state under the Treaty of San Francisco. One of the first <b>agendas</b> <b>of</b> Yoshida and his Cabinet was to establish the National Safety Agency (predecessor of the Japanese Defense Agency) to oversee both the NPR and the Coastal Safety Force (predecessor of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force). Hayashi and Keikichi Masuhara, Director-General of the NPR, supported the idea to put ground and maritime forces under the supervision of a unified body so as to avoid a recurrence of interservice rivalry during the Second World War. However, the Coastal Safety Force opposed the plan as they feared that they would be marginalized by the NPR, which was larger in scale. At last, Hayashi and Masuhara won the day and the National Safety Agency was formally established on 1 August.|$|E
25|$|Unable to {{implement}} and exercise {{the authority of}} the Parliament or the Crown's rule outside of this environ, and increasingly under the attack of raids by the Gaelic Irish and independent Hiberno-Norman nobles, the Palesmen themselves encouraged the Kings of England to take a more direct role in the affairs of Ireland. Geographic distance, the lack of attention by the Crown because of the Hundred Years' War and the Wars of the Roses, and the larger power of the Gaelic clans, all reduced the effectiveness of the Irish Parliament. Thus, increasingly worried that the Irish Parliament was essentially being overawed by powerful landed families in Ireland like the Earl of Kildare into passing laws that pursued the <b>agendas</b> <b>of</b> the different dynastic factions in the country, in 1494, the Parliament encouraged the passing of Poynings' Law which subordinated Irish Parliament to the English one.|$|E

25|$|The {{differences}} between how Native American and Black identities are defined today (blood quantum versus one-drop and political assumptions) {{have been based}} on different historical circumstances. According to the anthropologist Gerald Sider, such racial designations were a means to concentrate power, wealth, privilege and land in the hands of Whites in a society of White hegemony and privilege (Sider 1996; see also Fields 1990). The differences {{had little to do with}} biology and more to do with the history of slavery and its racism, and specific forms of White supremacy (the social, geopolitical and economic <b>agendas</b> <b>of</b> dominant Whites vis-à-vis subordinate Blacks and Native Americans). They related especially to the different social places which Blacks and Amerindians occupied in White-dominated 19th-century America. Sider suggests that the blood quantum definition of Native American identity enabled mixed-race Whites to acquire Amerindian lands during the allotment process. The one-drop rule of Black identity, enforced legally in the early 20th century, enabled Whites to preserve their agricultural labor force in the South. The contrast emerged because, as peoples transported far from their land and kinship ties on another continent, Black labor was relatively easy to control, and they became reduced to valuable commodities as agricultural laborers. In contrast, Amerindian labor was more difficult to control; moreover, Amerindians occupied large territories that became valuable as agricultural lands, especially with the invention of new technologies such as railroads. Sider thinks the blood quantum definition enhanced White acquisition of Amerindian lands in a doctrine of Manifest Destiny, which subjected Native Americans to marginalization and resulted in numerous conflicts related to American expansionism.|$|E
