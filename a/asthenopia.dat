25|$|Asthenia (Greek: ἀσθένεια, lit lack of {{strength}} but also disease) {{is a medical}} term referring to {{a condition in which}} the body lacks or has lost strength either as a whole or in any of its parts. It denotes symptoms of physical weakness and loss {{of strength}}. General asthenia occurs in many chronic wasting diseases (such as tuberculosis and cancer), sleep disorders or chronic disorders of the heart, lungs or kidneys, and is probably most marked in diseases of the adrenal gland. Asthenia may be limited to certain organs or systems of organs, as in <b>asthenopia,</b> characterized by ready fatiguability. Asthenia is also a side effect of some medications and treatments, such as Ritonavir (a protease inhibitor used in HIV treatment), vaccines such as the HPV vaccine Gardasil and fentanyl patches (an opioid used to treat pain).|$|E

5000|$|Convergence {{insufficiency}} is {{a common}} binocular vision disorder characterized by <b>asthenopia,</b> eye fatigue and discomfort. <b>Asthenopia</b> may be aggravated by close work and is thought by some to contribute to reading inefficiency. In 2005, the Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial (CITT) published two large, randomized clinical studies examining the efficacy of orthoptic vision therapy {{in the treatment of}} symptomatic convergence insufficiency. Although neither study examined reading efficiency or comprehension, both demonstrated that computerized home orthoptic exercises, when combined with weekly in-office vision therapy, were more effective than [...] "pencil pushups" [...] (a commonly prescribed home-based treatment) for improving the symptoms of <b>asthenopia</b> and the convergence ability of the eyes. The design and results of {{at least one of these}} studies has been met with some reservation, questioning the conclusion as to whether intensive office-based treatment programs are truly more efficacious than a properly implemented home-based regimen. The CITT has since published articles validating its research and treatment protocols. Its most recent publication suggested that home-based computer therapy [...] combined with office based vision therapy is more effective than pencil pushups or home-based computerised therapy alone for the treatment of symptomatic convergence insufficiency.|$|E
50|$|Astigmatism {{is quite}} common. Studies {{have shown that}} about one in three people suffers from it. The {{prevalence}} of astigmatism increases with age. Although a person may not notice mild astigmatism, higher amounts of astigmatism may cause blurry vision, squinting, <b>asthenopia,</b> fatigue, or headaches.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes, <b>asthenopia</b> can {{be due to}} {{specific}} visual problems, for example, uncorrected refraction errors or binocular vision problems such as accommodative insufficiency or heterophoria. It is often caused by the viewing of monitors {{such as those of}} computers or phones for prolonged periods of time.|$|E
50|$|Eye strain {{also known}} as <b>asthenopia</b> is an eye {{condition}} that manifests itself through nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, pain in or around the eyes, blurred vision, headache, and occasional double vision. Symptoms often occur after reading, computer work, or other close activities that involve tedious visual tasks.|$|E
50|$|Eyes {{exercise}} {{is a set}} of massage methods that aims at promoting students’ awareness of eye-protection, improving blood circulation and relaxing muscles in ocular region, relieving <b>asthenopia</b> and preventing myopia.

50|$|The major symptom is {{intermittent}} {{blurring of}} distance vision particularly noticeable after prolonged periods of near work, {{and symptoms of}} <b>asthenopia.</b> The vision may clear temporarily using concave (minus) lenses. The diagnosis is done by cycloplegic refraction using a strong cycloplegic like atropine or homatropine eye drops. Accommodative amplitude and facility may be reduced {{as a result of}} the ciliary muscle spasm.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} and signs associated with convergence insufficiency {{are related to}} prolonged, visually demanding, near-centered tasks. They may include, {{but are not limited}} to, diplopia (double vision), <b>asthenopia</b> (eye strain), transient blurred vision, difficulty sustaining near-visual function, abnormal fatigue, headache, and abnormal postural adaptation, among others. In some cases, difficulty with making eye contact have been noted as a complaint amongst sufferers.Note that some Internet resources confuse convergence and divergence dysfunction, reversing them.|$|E
50|$|Binocular vision {{anomalies}} {{are among}} the most common visual disorders. They are usually associated with symptoms such as headaches, <b>asthenopia,</b> eye pain, blurred vision, and occasional diplopia. About 20% of patients who come to optometry clinics will have binocular vision anomalies. The most effective way to diagnosis vision anomalies is with the near point of convergence test. During the NPC test, a target, such as a finger, is brought towards the face until the examiner notices that one eye has turned outward and/or the person has experienced diplopia or doubled vision.|$|E
50|$|Lazy eye, in {{particular}} strabismus {{may be the}} result of coordination between the extraocular muscles, which prevents a person on directing both eyes in unison towards the same fixation point. The main cause of strabismus is usually the muscular imbalance of the six surrounding muscles that allow both eyes to focus on the same object. As each eye does not have the same focus, different images are sent to the brain, confusing it, resulting in the brain ignoring the image from the weaker eye and if left untreated will cause a loss of vision in the ignored eye called amblyopia. Further symptoms of strabismus include decreased vision, double vision, headaches, <b>asthenopia</b> and eye fatigue.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Asthenopia</b> is {{a common}} {{complaint}} amongst patients who attend eye care settings. Owing to associated discomfort or distress, <b>asthenopia</b> affects efficient reading and performance of near tasks. Purpose: To study the prevalence of <b>asthenopia</b> and any association with refractive errors in a clinical setting. Methods: In this cross-sectional practice-based study, the clinic records of 1109 school-aged children (mean age and standard deviation 14. 39 ± 3. 39 years) were analysed. The sample comprised 427 (38. 5 %) male and 682 (61. 5 %) female patients {{between the ages of}} 6 and 19 years. Refractive errors were classified into various types, and the association between these refractive types and symptoms in <b>asthenopia</b> were explored. Results: The most common symptom of <b>asthenopia</b> was headaches (40. 8 %), of which temporal headaches were the most frequent type (15. 7 %). Various symptoms were significantly associated with mainly astigmatism. Conclusion: Headaches were the most frequent complaint amongst patients who attended the author’s optometric practice. Astigmatism was the most frequent cause of <b>asthenopia.</b> Female patients were more likely than male patients to complain of <b>asthenopia,</b> whilst high school students were more likely than primary school children to complain of <b>asthenopia.</b> Further studies to relate <b>asthenopia</b> to binocular anomalies will be relevant in enhancing our understanding of the relationship between <b>asthenopia</b> and vision anomalies...|$|E
40|$|<b>Asthenopia</b> is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} different symptoms {{associated with the use}} of the eyes, such as pain, blurred vision, diplopia, headaches. <b>Asthenopia</b> is most often reported in association with near vision. Children with <b>asthenopia</b> complain of such symptoms particularly when reading and writing. <b>Asthenopia</b> is often divided into two main categories: refractive including refractive errors and anisometropia, and muscular, comprising strabismus and convergence insufficiency. <b>Asthenopia</b> due to accommodative problems has in the present studies been regarded as muscular <b>asthenopia.</b> In paper I the prevalence of <b>asthenopia,</b> refractive errors and binocular disorders was determined in a representative population of 216 Swedish schoolchildren aged 6 15 years. The prevalence of <b>asthenopia</b> was 23. 1 %. The prevalence of hypermetropia and myopia changed with age, while astigmatism, convergence ability and strabismus did not. Accommodative insufficiency was more common in the older schoolchildren. <b>Asthenopia</b> was related to uncorrected visual acuity and refractive errors, and to accommodative insufficiency. Paper II described the orthoptic and ophthalmological findings in a group of 120 schoolchildren with <b>asthenopia.</b> The effect of <b>asthenopia</b> treatment was also evaluated. The most frequently occurring findings related to <b>asthenopia</b> were refractive errors, heterophoria and accommodative insufficiency. With appropriate treatment with glasses, prism or orthoptic exercises for 3 6 months, 112 out of the 120 children (93 %) became asymptomatic. In paper III 49 schoolchildren with <b>asthenopia</b> due to accommodative insufficiency were assessed with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the grade of <b>asthenopia</b> was correlated with the degree of accommodative deficiency. The aim was to investigate if VAS grading of the asthenopic symptoms could be used as an instrument to indicate the level of improvement of accommodative insufficiency after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of asthenopic symptoms as graded with the VAS scale was observed, and the improvement in accommodation was also significant. However, there was no correlation between VAS values and the accommodation before and after treatment, and VAS values can only give a general impression of the level of accommodative ability in <b>asthenopia</b> (p < 0. 001). Paper IV described how accommodative insufficiency influenced reading performance. Twelve children with <b>asthenopia</b> due to accommodative insufficiency were examined. Reading eye movements were recorded before and after treatment of <b>asthenopia,</b> using the IR corneal reflection technique, Orbit Eye trace System. Large variations in reading patterns were found. Despite successful accommodative treatment (p < 0. 001), no correlation was found to the different eye movement parameters that could suggest that reading velocity was improved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Asthenopia</b> (eyestrain) {{is defined}} as {{reversible}} fatigue of the eyes due to overuse of the visual system (Tiwari et al., 2011). This {{may be caused by}} an imbalance between visual capacity to fixate on a task and prolonged near work. Computer use is a common cause of <b>asthenopia,</b> with approximately 64 - 90 % of people using computers suffering from ocular discomfort. The symptoms of <b>asthenopia</b> include tired, burning, itching eyes; lacrimation; photophobia; blurred and double vision; as well as occasional headaches (Blehm et al., 2005). Dryness of the eyes is also commonly associated with computer-induced <b>asthenopia,</b> and further aggravates asthenopic symptoms. <b>Asthenopia</b> has an impact on work productivity as well as quality of life (Djalilian, 2016, Portello et al., 2012, Rosenfield, 2011). Conventional treatment for <b>asthenopia</b> includes the use of lubricating eye drops and occupational glasses (Gaby, 2008) and in addition forced blinking and punctal occlusion for dry eyes (Rosenfield, 2011). There are many homoeopathic remedies indicated for the treatment of <b>asthenopia.</b> The homoeopathic complex assessed in this study is a readily available eye drop solution that is indicated for the relief of computer-induced <b>asthenopia.</b> The complex contains the following remedies: Conium maculatum 6 X, Natrium muriaticum 6 X, Ruta graveolens 6 X and Senega officinalis 6 X.

40|$|To {{date the}} use of {{computers}} is widely distributed throughout the world and the associated ocular complaints are found in 75 - 90 % of the population of computer users. Symptoms frequently reported by computer users were eyestrain, tired eyes, irritation, redness, blurred vision, diplopia, burning of the eyes, and <b>asthenopia</b> (visual fatigue of the eyes). A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the etiology of <b>asthenopia</b> in computer-using students. A questionnaire consisting of 15 items was used to assess symptoms experienced by the computer users. The ophthalmological examination comprised visual acuity, the Hirschberg test, near point accommodation, amplitude accommodation, near point convergence, the cover test, and the alternate cover test. A total of 99 computer science students, of whom 69. 7 % had <b>asthenopia,</b> participated in the study. The symptoms that were significantly associated with <b>asthenopia</b> were visual fatigue (p= 0. 031), heaviness in the eye (p= 0. 002), blurred vision (p= 0. 001), and headache at the temples or {{the back of the head}} (p= 0. 000). Refractive <b>asthenopia</b> was found in 95. 7 % of all <b>asthenopia</b> patients with accommodative insufficiency (AI), constituting the most frequent cause at 50. 7 %. The duration of computer use per day was not significantly associated with the prevalence of <b>asthenopia</b> (p= 0. 700).

40|$|Objectives The {{current study}} aimed at {{determining}} <b>asthenopia</b> prevalence {{and its associated}} factors in a population of high school students. Methods In the current cross sectional study, samples were selected from high school students (range, 12 to 18 years) in Kermanshah city, Iran, through stratified cluster sampling. Any person with at least 1 symptom was considered to have <b>asthenopia.</b> Results Of the 1070 selected samples, 1040 participated, and examinations were completed for 901 students. The prevalence of <b>asthenopia</b> was 49. 4 % (45. 7 to 53. 2). The prevalence of <b>asthenopia</b> was 62. 8 % (51. 9 to 73. 8) and 47. 7 % (43. 8 to 51. 7) in males and females, respectively (P = 0. 013). <b>Asthenopia</b> prevalence increased from 21. 4 % in 12 -year-old to 63. 9 % in 18 -year-old cases (P < 0. 001). The most common symptom {{in the study was}} tearing (20. 03 %) and eye pain (19. 88 %) during near-work and reading.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{clarify the}} {{relation}} between the prevalence of dry eye syndrome and subjective symptoms of <b>asthenopia</b> in visual display terminal (VDT) operators. METHOD: 722 VDT workers (242 subject workers with symptoms of <b>asthenopia</b> and 480 controls without such symptoms) without obvious organic ocular diseases received an ophthalmological examination consisting of refractometry and a tear function (phenol red thread) test. RESULTS: More than 30 % of symptomatic workers were found to meet the criteria of dry eye, and the odds ratio compared with the controls was 4. 61 (p < 0. 001). This odds ratio was significantly greater than that obtained for refractive errors (2. 31). CONCLUSIONS: Although this cross sectional study could not prove that dry eyes are the cause of <b>asthenopia,</b> the profound association of dry eyes with symptoms of <b>asthenopia</b> could be verified. It would be useful to carry out tear function tests in workers with symptoms of <b>asthenopia...</b>|$|E
40|$|Context: There {{is growing}} body of {{evidence}} that use of computers can adversely affect the visual health. Considering the rising number of computer users in India, computer-related <b>asthenopia</b> might take an epidemic form. In view of that, this study was undertaken to find out the magnitude of <b>asthenopia</b> in computer operators and its relationship with various personal and workplace factors. Aims: To study the prevalence of <b>asthenopia</b> among computer operators and its association with various epidemiological factors. Settings and Design: Community-based cross-sectional study of 419 subjects who work on computer for varying period of time. Materials and Methods: Four hundred forty computer operators working in different institutes were selected randomly. Twenty-one did not participate in the study, making the nonresponse rate 4. 8 &#x 0025;. Rest of the subjects (n = 419) were asked to fill a pre-tested questionnaire, after obtaining their verbal consent. Other relevant information was obtained by personal interview and inspection of workstation. Statistical Analysis Used: Simple proportions and Chi-square test. Results: Among the 419 subjects studied, 194 (46. 3 &#x 0025;) suffered from <b>asthenopia</b> during or after work on computer. Marginally higher proportion of <b>asthenopia</b> was noted in females compared to males. Occurrence of <b>asthenopia</b> was significantly associated with age of starting use of computer, presence of refractive error, viewing distance, level of top of the computer screen with respect to eyes, use of antiglare screen and adjustment of contrast and brightness of monitor screen.

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to compare the symptoms of <b>asthenopia</b> in patients at different levels of hyperopia and corrected for different accommodative efforts. Methods: This study is an experimental design and quantitative approach. Sixty-nine hyperopic patients aged between 15 and 40 were selected. Individuals with a diagnosis of accommodative insufficiency and paralysis, accommodative spasm or any type of ocular deviation were excluded. Subjects were randomly divided into four groups. Each one performed a nearvision task with different corrective lenses, varying the value of the accommodative effort. Results: There is significant reduction in the <b>asthenopia</b> score during the near-vision task when leaving 35 % or more of the amplitude of accommodation in reserve. The linear regression showed that the variables total hyperopia (r = 0. 109) and the difference between static and dynamic refraction (r = 0. 135) did not obtain significant linear relationship to the <b>asthenopia</b> score. Conclusions: There is significant reduction in the <b>asthenopia</b> score when leaving 35 % or more of the amplitude of accommodation in reserve.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>asthenopia</b> in 0 - 18 year-old children through a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence studies. SOURCES: Inclusion criteria were population-based studies from 1960 to May of 2014 reporting the prevalence of <b>asthenopia</b> in children. The search was performed independently by two reviewers in the PubMed, EMBASE, and LILACS databases, with no language restriction. This systematic review was performed {{in accordance with the}} Cochrane Collaboration guidelines and the PRISMA Statement. Downs and Black score was used for quality assessment. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Out of 1692 potentially relevant citations retrieved from electronic databases and searches of reference lists, 26 were identified as potentially eligible. Five of these studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 2465 subjects. Pooled prevalence of <b>asthenopia</b> was 19. 7 % (12. 4 - 26. 4 %). The majority of children with <b>asthenopia</b> did not present visual acuity or refraction abnormalities.

40|$|The study {{covered a}} group of female VDT {{operators}} assigned to data entry and data acquisition. Subjective VDT-related symptoms of <b>asthenopia</b> were assessed {{by means of a}} questionnaire. All operators were examined by an ophthalmologist. Visual acuity was measured using vision tables with optotypes. In order to achieve an objective assessment of VDT-induced visual fatigue, refractive power was measured at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the shift, using an infra-red autorefractometer. Changes in refractive power were then related to VDT work and <b>asthenopia</b> symptoms. Visual acuity defects were observed in 63. 5 % of the operators; in 36 % of the cases the subjects were either unaware of the defects or the defects were not adequately corrected. 62. 5 % of the operators complained of subjective <b>asthenopia</b> symptoms. <b>Asthenopia</b> was not related to the number of hours at the VDT. The results suggest that ametropic subjects are likely to be more susceptible to visual fatigue than emmetropic subjects, since there was a tendency for the prevalence of <b>asthenopia</b> to increase in the former group. A significant decrease in refractive power (temporary myopization) was observed in 20 % of the operators at the end of the shift at the VDT: all these subjects also complained of <b>asthenopia,</b> compared to 50 % of the workers without end-of-shift myopization.

The average shift of MKT was about 2. 98 ± 3. 57 second within 68. 1 % of thesubjects, which were evaluated after 4 -hour working time with their VDT. The distance between the eyes to VDT and the satisfaction with the working shift arrangement had significant correlation with the occurrence of <b>asthenopia.</b> There was significant correlation between subjective complaints such as pain within the area around the eyes,headache and dry eyes due to increasing of the MR...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Visual {{display units}} (VDU’s) such as laptops, tablets, smartphones, computers, game {{consoles}} and televisions {{have become an}} essential part of our modern life both in school and at work places (Izquierdo & Townsend, 2008). Up to 90 % of computer users may experience visual symptoms {{at one time or another}} with the use of VDU’s (Barthakur, 2013). <b>Asthenopia</b> (eyestrain) is typically associated with near-work and symptoms include dry eyes, eye fatigue and difficulty focusing. The major cause of computer-induced <b>asthenopia</b> is fatigue of the ciliary and extra-ocular muscles due to prolonged accommodation and vergence required by near-vision work (Tiwari et al., 2011). The severity of the symptoms is proportional to the time spent using a VDU device and symptoms are substantially reduced after discontinuing usage; even so, the symptoms can affect work productivity and quality of life (Barthakur, 2013). Conventional treatment for <b>asthenopia</b> includes correction of refractive errors, use of occupational glasses, eye drops and punctal occlusion (Garin, 2014); ergonomic measures can also be helpful (Barthakur, 2013). Homoeopathy is a holistic treatment modality based on the “Law of Similars” (Dekkers, 2009). Homoeopathic remedies enhance the body’s own curative abilities, enabling the body to heal itself (Ahmad, 2005). Homoeopathic remedies may provide a safe complementary treatment option for <b>asthenopia.</b> The homoeopathic complex eye drop solution used in this study consists of Conium maculatum 6 X, Natrum muriaticum 6 X, Ruta graveolens 6 X and Senega officinalis 6 X.

40|$|M. Tech. (Homoeopathy) Abstract: Computer-induced <b>asthenopia</b> (eyestrain) {{is defined}} as fatigue of the ciliary and extraocular muscles from {{prolonged}} near vision work on a visual display unit (Tiwari et al., 2011). Common symptoms associated with <b>asthenopia</b> include: ocular discomfort; dry, red, itchy or irritated eyes; eye fatigue; intermittent diplopia at near fixation; blurred vision; and frontal headache (Sheedy et al., 2003). About 70 % of computer user’s worldwide experience eye discomfort and there are {{an increasing number of}} people affected by it (Barthakar, 2013). Current conventional treatment for <b>asthenopia</b> involves ergonomic measures, eye drops to help with eye moisture, occupational glasses, correction of refractive errors and punctal occlusion (Garin, 2014). The homoeopathic complex eye drop solution is a commercially available eye drop solution indicated for the relief of computer-induced <b>asthenopia</b> symptoms and contains Conium maculatum 6 X, Natrum chloratum 6 X, Ruta graveolens 6 Xand Senega officinalis 6 X. No research to date could be found on the effect of this complex on the symptoms of computer-induced <b>asthenopia.</b> The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the effect of a homoeopathic complex eye drop solution on the symptoms of computer-induced <b>asthenopia</b> using a Symptom Index Questionnaire. This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, one day study. The study took place at the University of Johannesburg (UJ) Doornfontein campus. Fifty participants between the ages of 18 - 35 years were recruited by means of purposive sampling. The sample group was shared with another researcher focusing on rating ocular discomfort using a visual analogue scale and assessing tear breakup time (TBUT). Participants were recruited by means of advertisements placed at the UJ Doornfontein campus with permission given. An initial consultation took place at the UJ Optometry Clinic; all potential participants were requested to read and sign the Participant Information and Consent Form and complete the Participant Selection Questionnaire. The participants who met the criteria were screened for any refractive errors using an autorefractor by a qualified optometrist. The participants who had significant refractive errors were excluded from the study. Participants proceeded to the computer lab at UJ to play a computer game for a two hour period, after which they then completed the Symptom Index Questionnaire (SIQ), evaluating the symptoms of <b>asthenopia.</b> Participants then returned to the computer lab and were divided into two groups: one group received the homoeopathic complex eye drop solution (treatment group) and the other group distilled water [...] ...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the positive effects}} of blue-violet light filtering lenses in delaying myopia and relieving <b>asthenopia</b> in juveniles. METHODS: Sixty ametropia juveniles (aged range, 11 - 15 y) were randomized into two groups: the test group (30 children, 60 eyes), wearing blue-violet light filtering lenses; and the control group (30 children, 60 eyes), wearing ordinary aspherical lenses. Baseline refractive power of the affected eyes and axial length of the two groups was recorded. After 1 -year, the patients underwent contrast sensitivity (glare and non-glare under bright and dark conditions), accommodation-related testing, <b>asthenopia</b> questionnaire assessment, and adverse reaction questionnaire assessment. RESULTS: After 1 y of wearing the filtering lenses, changes in refractive power and axial length were not significantly different between the two groups (P> 0. 05). Under bright conditions, the contrast sensitivities at low and medium-frequency grating (vision angles of 6. 3 °, 4. 0 °, and 2. 5 °) with glare in the test group were significantly higher than in the control group (P 0. 05). In the test group, the amplitude of accommodation, accommodative lag, and accommodative sensitivity of patients wearing glasses for 6 and 12 mo were significantly elevated (P 0. 05), and the <b>asthenopia</b> grating was not significantly decreased (P> 0. 05). In addition, after wearing glasses for 6 to 12 mo, the <b>asthenopia</b> grating of patients in the test group decreased significantly compared with the control group (P 0. 05). CONCLUSION: A 1 -year follow-up reveal that compare with ordinary glasses, short-wavelength filtering lenses (blue/violet-light filters) increase the low- and medium-frequency contrast sensitivity under bright conditions and improved accommodation. They effectively relieved <b>asthenopia</b> without severe adverse reactions, suggesting potential for clinical application. However, no significant advantages in terms of refractive power or axial length progression were found compared with ordinary aspheric lenses...|$|E
