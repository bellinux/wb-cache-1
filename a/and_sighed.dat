25|$|In Tolkien's universe, Mirkwood is {{populated}} predominantly by elves, and {{has included}} King Oropher {{and his son}} Thranduil and grandson Legolas. However, the race of Silvan Elves are the dominant dwellers of Mirkwood. Their homes lie deep in the forest (as recollected by Aragorn and Legolas when the Company of the Ring reached the Silverlode) in the Fellowship of the Ring.'Indeed deep in the wood they dwell,' said Aragorn, <b>and</b> <b>sighed</b> as if some memory stirred in him...'|pages=329|chapter=Lothlórien}} Sauron however secretly built a stronghold {{in the region and}} slowly took the southern regions of the land from the elves without battle over time. As a result, the forest began to host Orcs, Nazgûl, and giant spiders.|$|E
2500|$|In 209, when Cao Cao was {{returning}} to Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) after his defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs, he passed by Baqiu (巴丘), where a plague broke out in his army. He ordered the boats to be burnt, <b>and</b> <b>sighed,</b> [...] "If Guo Fengxiao was around, I wouldn't have ended up like this." [...] Cao Cao mourned Guo Jia again. He also wrote to Xun Yu twice to lament Guo Jia's death.|$|E
2500|$|Xu Sheng's ruse {{effectively}} led to {{the construction}} of a [...] "wall" [...] along the river banks that served as a border stretching over hundreds of li. When Cao Pi reached Guangling Commandery (廣陵郡; covering parts of present-day Jiangsu), he saw Sun Quan's [...] "strong defences" [...] and the high tide <b>and</b> <b>sighed,</b> [...] "Wei has thousands of armed cavalry units but they can't be deployed here". He then withdrew his forces. Sun Quan's generals finally recognised the value of Xu Sheng's plan.|$|E

2500|$|Marlowe is {{adept at}} using liquor to loosen peoples' tongues. An example is in The High Window, when Marlowe finally persuades the detective-lieutenant, whose [...] "solid old face was lined and grey with fatigue", {{to take a}} drink and thereby loosen up and give out. [...] "Breeze looked at me very steadily. Then he sighed. Then he picked the glass up and tasted it <b>and</b> <b>sighed</b> again {{and shook his head}} {{sideways}} with a half smile; the way a man does when you give him a drink and he needs it very badly and it is just right and the first swallow is like a peek into a cleaner, sunnier, brighter world." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. When I entered, the place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It looked as if it had crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he saw me and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. I went over and asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged <b>and</b> <b>sighed.</b> [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed something that I would see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E
