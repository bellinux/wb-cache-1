50|$|Pericopsis elata, the African teak, afromosia, or <b>afrormosia,</b> is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the legume family, Fabaceae, which is native to moist, semi-deciduous African forests. It is a tall tree that produces timber of high commercial value.|$|E
50|$|Illegal {{logging and}} habitat loss pose a {{realistic}} {{threat to the}} <b>afrormosia,</b> which ranks among the most valued hard tropical timber species. Following decades of extraction in the 20th and 21st century, it is ranked CITES Appendix II. This implies that it is subject to trade regulation because it is recognised that unregulated trade puts the species at risk of extinction. The factors that control its population dynamics are however imperfectly known. With a minimum logging diameter of 90 cm, full recovery is expected over a 30 year period. Selective logging of 12% of seed trees {{has been shown to}} have little influence on its survival. Sustainability is believed to be best achieved by purposeful actions to ensure regeneration after logging.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt is {{well known}} that the plant kingdom {{contains}} numerous bioactive substances affecting the regulation of reproduction. The present study was undertaken to examine the putative contraceptive effects of three traditional plant extracts from Cote d'Ivoire Pharmacopea. It concerns <b>Afrormosia</b> laxiflora (Papilionacea), Pterocarpus erinaceus (Papilionacea) and Cola nitida (Sterculiacea) stem bark. Data showed that treatment of rats with these plant extracts induced ovulation and oestrous cycle blockade at the dioestrous II stage. The analysis of the principal hormones involved in oestrous cycle regulation showed that the plant extracts decreased gonadotropin release (both LH and FSH). In fact, A. laxiflora, P. erinaceus and C. nitida extracts inhibited gonadotropin release as an antiestrogen-like substanc...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePrevious {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} that stem bark extracts of Combretodendron macrocarpum (Barringtoniaceae), Cola nitida (Sterculiaceae), <b>Afrormosia</b> laxiflora and Pterocarpus erinaceus (Fabaceae) blocked the oestrus cycle of female rats through antigonadotropic activity. Moreover, {{a study of the}} plant substances responsible for these effects revealed the presence of phyto-anti-oestrogens in these plant extracts. In order to explain the mechanism by which these substances exert their antifertility actions, the interaction of the plant extract with oestrogen and progesterone receptors was studied. All crude extracts exerted inhibition of ((3) H) -oestradiol or ((3) H) -Organon binding to their respective receptors but their relative affinities were much lower than those of oestradiol or progesterone. Respective efficiencies of plant extracts in competing for the oestrogen receptor were as follows: A. laxiflora > P. erinaceus > C. macrocarpum > C. nitida. The efficiency order of competition for the progestin receptor was different to that of oestrogen. The most potent competitor was C. macrocarpum extract, followed by P. erinaceus, C. nitida and A. laxiflora. Moreover, the interaction between oestradiol and plant extracts with the oestrogen receptor was determined to be competitive only for C. macrocarpum and A. laxiflora, whereas all compounds produced a competitive inhibition on the progestin receptor binding. These results suggest that the plant extract binding site was the same site as for the steroid. These results suggest also that crude plant extracts may interfere with natural oestrogen and/or progestagen in vivo by binding to steroid receptor...|$|E
40|$|<b>Afrormosia</b> laxiflora (A. laxiflora), Chenopodium ambrosioides (C. ambrosioides), Microglossa pyrifolia (M. pyrifolia) and Mimosa pudica (M. pudica) are plants used in {{traditional}} medicine in Cameroon to treat insomnia, epilepsy, anxiety, and agitation. They were evaluated for their anxiolytic like activity in mice. Animal models (elevated plus maze and stress-induced hyperthermia tests) were used. The four plants showed anxiolytic activity. In stress-induced hyperthermia test, A. laxiflora, C. ambrosioides, M. pyrifolia and M. pudica significantly antagonised {{the increase of}} temperature. ΔT° decreased from 0. 75 °C {{in the control group}} to 0. 36 °C at the dose of 110 mg/kg for A. laxiflora; from 1 °C in the control group to − 1. 1 °C at the dose of 120 mg/kg for C. ambrosioides; from 1. 7 °C in the control group to 0. 2 °C at the dose of 128 mg/kg for M. pyrifolia and from 1. 3 °C in the control group to 0. 5 °C at the dose of 180 mg/kg for M. pudica. In the elevated plus maze test, the four plants increased the number of entries into, percentage of entries into, and percentage of time in open arms. A. laxiflora, C. ambrosioides and M. pudica also reduced the percentage of entries and time in closed arms. In addition, C. ambrosioides, M. pyrifolia and M. pudica showed antipyretic activity by reducing the body temperature. The results suggested that C. ambrosioides, M. pyrifolia and M. pudica posses anxiolytic-like and antipyretic activities while A. laxiflora possesses only anxiolytic-like properties. These plants could be helpful in the treatment of anxiety and fever {{in traditional}} medicine in Cameroon...|$|E
40|$|Pericopsis elata (Fabaceae – assamela, <b>afrormosia,</b> kokrodua) is a {{high valued}} timber species of the moist semi {{deciduous}} African forests. Because of logging which started more than 50 years ago, it is considered as threatened and included on both IUCN Red List and CITES Appendix II. Nevertheless, there is still little information available on the species ecology: essential biological parameters controlling its population dynamics remain unknown. Our study first aims at improving the knowledge of its main ecological parameters, then at assessing the impact of selective logging on its populations in a forest management unit in Cameroon (ca 120, 000 ha). After inventorying the species (sampling rate of 1. 2 %), mortality and growth were assessed over continuous 5 and 2 -year periods in unlogged and logged areas, respectively. Phenology was monitored in the unlogged forest during 5 years (leaf shedding and flushing, flowering, ripe and unripe fruiting). The population structure followed a bell-shaped curve. Mean annual diameter increments in both environments {{did not differ significantly}} between unlogged and logged areas (0. 29 ± 0. 06 0. 31 ± 0. 04 cm for unlogged and logged areas, respectively). P. elata is a deciduous species that flowers {{at the end of the}} main dry season (Marsh-April). The minimum reproduction and effective flowering diameters were, respectively, 32 and 37 cm. Fruit maturation took place during 7 months (the seed rain occurs in December-January), but all unripe fruits abort 3 years out of 5. With a minimum logging diameter of 90 cm, the recovery rate computed over a 30 -year period was greater than 100 %. Selective logging harvested only 12. 1 % of the total number of seed trees and had little influence on the species biological parameters. Securing sufficient regeneration as a post-logging action is probably the most important consideration for achieving long-term sustainability. Peer reviewe...|$|E
