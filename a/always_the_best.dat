Group music therapy can include group discussions concerning moods and emotions in or toward music, songwriting, and musical improvisation.

Group therapy, however, is not <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> choice for the client. Ongoing one-on-one music therapy {{has also been shown}} to be effective. One-on-one music therapy provides a non-invasive, non-judgmental environment, encouraging clients to show capacities that may be hidden in group situations.|$|E

This {{is especially true in}} modern Language Arts classes through the use of smart phones, tablets, and social media. Students are exposed to the language of the internet more than ever, and as such, the grammatical structure and slang of the internet are bleeding into their formal writing. Full immersion into a language is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> way to learn it. Mark Lester in his book Teaching Grammar and Usage states, “The biggest single problem that basic writers have in developing successful strategies for coping with errors is simply their lack of exposure to formal written English...We would think it absurd to expect a student to master a foreign language without extensive exposure to it.” Since students are immersed in internet language, that is the form and structure they are mirroring.|$|E

500|$|In September 2010, Today {{newspaper}} reported that {{statistics from the}} National Parks Board indicated {{that the number of}} groups registering to stage events at Speakers' Corner had fallen from 39 between September 2008 and August 2009, to nine between September 2009 and August 2010. The number of individuals registering dropped from 102 to 57 during the same periods. Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, who was Prime Minister when Speakers' Corner was set up, expressed the view that its use had declined because there were now other avenues for people to express themselves such as the Internet (including the Government's online feedback portal Reach), newspapers, and radio and television channels. Also, people might feel that the venue is not <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> place [...] "to meaningfully and constructively press their views on issues".

IGN believed that Ocarina of Time improved on the graphics of Super Mario 64, giving a larger sense of scale. Impressive draw distances and large boss characters were also mentioned as graphical highlights. Although excelling {{in the use of}} color and the visibility and detail of the environment, reviewers noted that some graphical elements of Ocarina of Time did not perform as well as Banjo-Kazooie, a game released for the same platform earlier that year. IGN said that the frame rate and textures of Ocarina of Time were not as good as those of Banjo-Kazooie, particularly in the marketplace of Hyrule Castle, which was called [...] "blurry".|$|E

500|$|Synthesis methods allow {{better control}} of the precise filter {{response}}. [...] A common response function used by filter designers is the Chebyshev filter which trades steepness of the transition band for passband ripple. [...] However the Chebyshev response is not <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> choice for waffle-iron filters. [...] Low-pass waveguide filters do not pass frequencies {{all the way down}} to zero because of the waveguide cutoff effect. [...] A better choice is the Achieser-Zolotarev filter. [...] This filter is based on Zolotarev polynomials (which include the Chebyshev polynomials as a special case) discovered by Yegor Ivanovich Zolotarev. [...] The Zolotarev response has a stopband at low frequency, the cutoff of which can be controlled by the designer so it is not detrimental in a waveguide filter. [...] The advantage of the Zolotarev response is that it results in a filter with a better impedance match to the connecting waveguides compared to the Chebyshev filter or image-parameter filters.|$|E
500|$|In {{casting the}} first series of Holby City, Young—who had {{previously}} {{worked on the}} soap operas Brookside and Family Affairs—selected actors who were already established names in the acting industry, particularly from a soap opera background. French had starred in the BBC's EastEnders, while Stephenson and Faulkner had starred in Brookside. Griffin had also appeared in ITV's Coronation Street. Young explained: [...] "Some of the best performances on screen {{have come out of}} soaps in the past few years. There is a fantastic amount of talent on those shows." [...] This propensity for hiring established actors continued as the soap progressed, with former Brookside actress Patricia Potter cast as registrar Diane Lloyd, Star Wars actor Denis Lawson cast as consultant Tom Campbell-Gore, and Family Affairs star Rocky Marshall cast as SHO Ed Keating. Later roles were awarded to comedian Adrian Edmondson, former film actress Patsy Kensit, and Jesus of Nazareth star Powell. When Jane Asher was cast in the recurring role of Lady Byrne in 2007, Inside Soap magazine asked Kyle whether the production team intentionally sought out [...] "well-known-names". She responded: [...] "It's lovely when we have a new member of the cast come in and bring an audience with them.

He also said Carl presents [...] "different fronts to different people" [...] and opined that there is [...] "a bit of nice in him", but he likes to dominate, make money and have influence, and would not be good until he achieves that. He wondered if Carl would be capable of settling down and starting a family. On playing a villain, Coonan said, [...] "It is good fun playing the bad guys. They are the <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> to play. They do not care how people perceive them. They do not have the normal social restrictions." [...] He said that Carl is [...] "slightly psychotic" [...] and is [...] "the sort of person who finds it genuinely heartwarming to see people suffer". In October 2013, Coonan said that Carl had been [...] "an absolute bastard" [...] during his six months in the show.|$|E
2500|$|Gonet is an {{established}} actress in British television, {{known for her}} role in the 1990s BBC series The House of Eliott. Her casting as Jayne follows a trend of Holby City producers towards hiring established British actors - with Gonet joining a series 9 cast alongside former film actress Patsy Kensit as Ward Sister Faye Morton, comedian Adrian Edmondson as Consultant Surgeon Abra Durant and Jesus of Nazareth star Robert Powell as Nursing Consultant Mark Williams. Series creator Mal Young commented on the preference for established names when discussing Holby Citys inception, explaining: [...] "Soap actors are the best actors. There’s been so much snobbery before. The whole thing about typecasting was probably invented by actors who couldn’t get other work. From day one I knew I wanted to put on screen people that viewers want to watch. There’s no downside to that." [...] Series producer Diana Kyle also addressed this trend in November 2007, when asked: [...] "When you cast an actor, do you actively seek out well-known names - like Jane Asher (Lady Byrne) and Patsy Kensit (Faye) - or will a role simply go to whoever's better suited?".
