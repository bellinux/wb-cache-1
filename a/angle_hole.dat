High mainstream Reynolds number produces larger coolant flow rate and hence better cooling effectiveness. For x/C 0. 15 on suction side.

40|$|High turbine inlet {{temperature}} becomes necessary for increasing thermal efficiency of modern gas turbines. To prevent failure of turbine components, advance cooling technologies have been applied to different portions of turbine blades. The detailed film cooling effectiveness distributions along a rotor blade has been studied under combined effects of upstream trailing edge unsteady wake with coolant ejection by the pressure sensitive paint (PSP). The experiment is conducted in a low speed wind tunnel with a five blade linear cascade and exit Reynolds number is 370, 000. The density ratios for both blade and trailing edge coolant ejection range from 1. 5 to 2. 0. Blade blowing ratios are 0. 5 and 1. 0 on suction surface and 1. 0 and 2. 0 on pressure surface. Trailing edge jet blowing ratio and Strouhal number are 1. 0 and 0. 12, respectively. Results show the unsteady wake reduces overall effectiveness. However, the unsteady wake with trailing edge coolant ejection enhances overall effectiveness. Results also show that the overall effectiveness increases by using heavier coolant for ejection and blade film cooling. Leading edge film cooling has been investigated using PSP. There are two test models: seven and three-row of film holes for simulating vane and blade, respectively. Four film holes? configurations are used for both models: radial <b>angle</b> cylindrical <b>holes,</b> compound <b>angle</b> cylindrical <b>holes,</b> radial <b>angle</b> shaped <b>holes,</b> and compound <b>angle</b> shaped <b>holes.</b> Density ratios are 1. 0 to 2. 0 while blowing ratios are 0. 5 to 1. 5. Experiments were conducted in a low speed wind tunnel with Reynolds number 100, 900. The turbulence intensity near test model is about 7 %. The results show the shaped holes have overall higher effectiveness than cylindrical holes for both designs. As increasing density ratio, density effect on shaped holes becomes evident. Radial <b>angle</b> <b>holes</b> perform better than compound <b>angle</b> <b>holes</b> as increasing blowing and density ratios. Increasing density ratio generally increases overall effectiveness for all configurations and blowing ratios. One exception occurs for compound angle and radial <b>angle</b> shaped <b>hole</b> of three-row design at lower blowing ratio.

40|$|Very limited {{experimental}} data {{is available for}} aerodynamic and film cooling effectiveness under rotating condition in the literature. As a result, {{there is a strong}} need to study in detail and discover essential features of turbine platform and blade tip film cooling under engine representative flow and rotating conditions. This dissertation deals with the specific heat transfer and aerodynamics problematic inherent to high pressure (HP) turbine sections. Major efficiency improvement has been achieved by introducing a completely new endwall contouring technology which decreases the strength of the secondary flow vortices. Efficiency measurements show for the contoured rotor a maximum efficiency of 89. 9 % compared to the reference non-contoured case of nt-s = 88. 86 %. This is an efficiency increase of nt-s = 1. 04 %. The new method of endwall contouring not only has improved the turbine aerodynamic efficiency but it also has substantially improved the film cooling effectiveness of the contoured endwall. The film cooling experiments were carried out using pressure sensitive paint (PSP) measurement technique. Measurements were conducted for three coolant-to-mainstream mass flow ratios (MFR) of 0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 1. 5 %. Film cooling data is also obtained for three rotational speeds, 3000 rpm (reference condition), 2550 rpm and 2400 rpm and they are compared with non-contoured endwall data. For 3000 rpm two more coolant to mainstream mass flow ratio of 0. 75 % and 1. 25 % are performed to have a better view of how film cooling effectiveness is changing. Comparing experimental results of the film cooling effectiveness investigations of the contoured case with the reference non-contoured case, clearly shows the improving effect of contouring on film cooling effectiveness for all cases investigated in this report. Four different blade tip ejection configurations were utilized to determine the impact of the hole arrangements on the film cooling effectiveness: plane tip with tip hole cooling, squealer tip with tip hole cooling, plane tip with pressure-side-edge compound <b>angle</b> <b>hole</b> cooling and squealer tip with pressure-side-edge compound <b>angle</b> <b>hole</b> cooling. To avoid rotor imbalance, every pair is installed radially. Film cooling effectiveness measurements were performed for three blowing ratios (M) of 0. 75, 1. 25 and 1. 75. Film cooling data was also obtained for three rotational speeds; 3000 rpm (reference condition), 2550 rpm and 2000 rpm. Film cooling measurements were performed using pressure sensitive paint (PSP) technique.

40|$|One {{approach}} to realize a back contact solar cell design is to 'wrap'' the front contacts to {{the backside of}} the cell [1]. This results in significantly reduced shadowing losses, possibility of simplified module assembly process and reduced resistance losses in the module; a combination of measures, which are ultimately expected to lower the cost per watt of PV modules. A large number of micro-vias must be drilled in a silicon wafer to connect {{the front and rear}} contacts. Laser drilling was investigated using a pulsed disk laser which provided independent adjustment of pulse width, repetition rate and laser power. To achieve very high drilling rates, synchronization of the laser pulses with the two-axis galvanometer scanner was established using a FPGA controller. A design of experiments (DOE) was developed and executed to understand the key process drivers that impact the average hole size, hole taper angle, drilling rate and hole quality. Laser drilling tests were per formed on wafers with different thicknesses between 120 m and 190 m. The primary process parameters included the average laser power, pulse length and pulse repetition rate. The impact of different laser spot sizes (34 m and 80 m) on the drilling results was compared. The results show that average hole sizes between 30 - 100 m can be varied by changing processing parameters such as laser power, pulse length, repetition rate and spot size. In addition, this study shows the effect of such parameters on the hole taper <b>angle,</b> <b>hole</b> quality and drilling rate.

The main objective of PASADO is to develop an environmental, climatic and volcanological science network focussing on (A) quantitative climate reconstruction in combination with proxy-model intercomparison and (B) investigation of the phreatomagmatic formation and analysis of early sedimentation in a young maar-diatreme structure. Within PASADO it is proposed to recover long sediment cores from Laguna Potrok Aike, a 770, 000 year old maar lake in the dry steppe of southern Patagonia, Argentina (52 °S, 70 °W; max. depth: 100 m; diameter: 3470 m). Seismic surveys demonstrate that at least 400 m of pelagic sediments were deposited in the lake centre underlain by an unknown thickness of volcaniclastic breccias. Based on seismic data, three drilling sites were selected: (1) from the deepest part of the lake to (i) obtain a continuous and high-resolution record of climatic and environmental changes and (ii) unveil the phreatomagmatic history including more precise age constrains for the maar-diatreme formation from the volcaniclastic sediments below, (2) from a subaquatic lake level terrace at 35 m water depth to constrain the range of lake level variations and (3) from an <b>angle</b> <b>hole</b> passing through lacustrine sediments and the crater wall into the basement rocks (molasse sandstones) to study the impact of explosive volcanism, post-eruptive structural evolution and early processes of sedimentation in a mid-Pleistocene maar.

40|$|An {{effort is}} made to numerically study the impact of {{rotating}} turbine conditions on the aerodynamic performance, film cooling effectiveness and heat transfer with {{the application of the}} endwall contouring and blade tip ejection. For this purpose, the three-stage HP turbine research facility at the Turbomachinery Performance and Flow Research Laboratory (TPFL), Texas A&M University, was newly designed and equipped. Using the geometry of this three-stage research turbine rig, comprehensive numerical simulations are performed to systematically study the impact of the rotation from the perspectives of both aerodynamics and heat transfer. Introducing endwall contouring has become a promising means to reduce the secondary flow losses. Thus TPFL developed a physics-based method which enables researchers and engineers to design endwall contours for any arbitrary blade types regardless of the blade loading, degree of reaction, stage load and flow coefficients. Using this approach, TPFL designed the new endwall contouring which was implemented on the platform of both the first-stage and second-stage rotors. The rotation impacts on the aerodynamics performance due to the endwall contouring were numerically studied using four different rotational speeds namely, 2000 rpm, 2400 rpm, 2600 rpm and 3000 rpm. Meanwhile, the influence on film cooling effectiveness and heat transfer caused by the endwall contouring was investigated for the first-stage rotor. Different purge-to-mainstream mass flow ratios of MFR = 0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 1. 5 % were taken into account at the design rotational speed of 3000 rpm. The effect of rotational speed (2400 rpm, 2550 rpm and 3000 rpm) was investigated at typical MFR= 1. 0 %. To investigate the flow characteristics and film cooling at high pressure turbine blade tips, four different rotor-blade tip configurations are designed and studied at TPFL: the plane and squealer tips with tip hole cooling and the plane and squealer tips with pressure-side-edge compound <b>angle</b> <b>hole</b> cooling. Seven perpendicular holes that are evenly distributed along the camber line are used for the tip hole cooling, whilst eight compound-angle holes for the pressure-side-edge cooling. The coolant was ejected through the cooling holes with low, medium and high global blowing ratios at 3000 rpm to study the impact of the blowing ratio on both the cooling effectiveness and heat transfer. Effects of rotation on the cooling effectiveness and heat transfer were calculated at the rotational speeds of 2000 rpm, 2550 rpm, and 3000 rpm...|$|E

Such records are a key to a better evaluation of climatic teleconnections and inter-hemispheric differences.

The most extreme oceanic character globally is encountered from 40 - 60 &# 778;S where Patagonia and a few islands are juxtaposed to 98 % of ocean. This region close to the Andean volcanic chain is subject to shifts in polar and mid-latitude pressure fields and precipitation regimes.

Patagonia thus can potentially provide unique terrestrial records of variations in (1) climate, (2) hydrology and (3) deposition of aeolian dust.

Additionally, links can be established to ice cores from Antarctica and to marine records from the Southern Oceans where dust and tephra of Patagonian provenance have been detected.

40|$|Creep {{degradation}} of steam carrying {{vessels in the}} power generation industry is a concern {{that needs to be}} constantly monitored. The Weldcore® process has been earmarked as a potential method of creep sampling which will allow for thick-walled sections to be analysed. A component of the process involves plugging the resultant hole after removing a creep sample using a novel welding technique called friction hydro pillar processing. At the commencement of this study, insufficient data was available to warrant safe industrial application of the process. This research was conducted to evaluate the performance of 10 CrMo 910 friction hydro pillar process welds. The effects of downward force, stud taper <b>angle,</b> <b>hole</b> taper angle and hole base diameter on process response, defect population, static properties and dynamic performance were evaluated. The variation of downward force showed that higher forces produce significantly smaller defects and higher fatigue life. The occurrence of defects was linked to process parameters and geometry thereby identifying the correct parameters for safe use in the power generation industry. Flash formation was identified as an early indicator of weld defects and can assist with quality control in industrial applications. Methods of standardising the plunge depth and forge force were developed to identify the correct magnitudes for different geometries, without the need for testing. Defects were shown to populate specific regions of the weld and produce variations in fatigue life. Crack initiation sites were detected which will aid in identifying areas of focus in further research and development. Temperature measurements were linked to the occurrence of defects and crack initiation sites and have been identified as a method of identifying defective welds. The effects of process parameters and stud and hole taper angles on energy inputs and near interface temperatures were statistically evaluated. Downward force was shown to have the largest effect on energy input rates, total energy input and temperatures at the 11. 5 mm and 20. 5 mm positions. Smaller hole and stud taper angles produced lower energy inputs and were identified as more energy efficient than the larger taper angles. A regression model was also developed to predict the fatigue life of welds and can assist with critical process related decision making. A range of hole base diameters were identified which produced welds with low defect populations and fatigue performance {{similar to that of the}} parent plate. Larger hole base diameters were shown to produce significant defects along the hole bottom fillet, in the weld nugget and along the bond line. Temperature measurements of the larger diameter welds showed a delay in response and are attributed to a delayed contact of plasticised stud material with the sidewall. Welds with hole base diameters larger than 11 mm produced unrepeatable and defective welds, and also required higher energy inputs making smaller diameters more desirable. Analysis of all welds in this study revealed that clearance and interfacial pressures characterise the quality of friction hydro pillar process welds, therefore models were developed to aid in critical decision making with respect to downward force and geometry. This study has successfully evaluated the effects of process parameters and geometry on the properties of friction hydro pillar process welds and thereby has increased understanding of the process...|$|E

Advanced cooling technologies must be applied to cool the blades, so they can withstand the extreme conditions. Film cooling is widely used in modern high temperature and high pressure blades as an active cooling scheme. In this study, the film cooling effectiveness in different regions of gas turbine blades was investigated with various film hole/slot configurations and mainstream flow conditions. The study consisted of four parts: 1) effect of upstream wake on blade surface film cooling, 2) effect of upstream vortex on platform purge flow cooling, 3) influence of <b>hole</b> shape and <b>angle</b> on leading edge film cooling and 4) slot film cooling on trailing edge. Pressure sensitive paint (PSP) technique was used to get the conduction-free film cooling effectiveness distribution. For the blade surface film cooling, the effectiveness from axial shaped <b>holes</b> and compound <b>angle</b> shaped <b>holes</b> were examined. Results showed that the compound <b>angle</b> shaped <b>holes</b> offer better film effectiveness than the axial shaped holes. The upstream stationary wakes have detrimental effect on film effectiveness in certain wake rod phase positions. For platform purge flow cooling, the stator-rotor gap was simulated by a typical labyrinth-like seal. Delta wings were used to generate vortex and modeled the passage vortex generated by the upstream vanes. Results showed that the upstream vortex reduces the film cooling effectiveness on the platform. For the leading edge film cooling, two film cooling designs, each with four film cooling hole configurations, were investigated. Results showed that the shaped holes provide higher film cooling effectiveness than the cylindrical holes at higher average blowing ratios. In the same range of average blowing ratio, the radial <b>angle</b> <b>holes</b> produce better effectiveness than the compound <b>angle</b> <b>holes.</b> The seven-row design results in much higher effectiveness than the three-row design.

30|$|Foam {{is often}} used for underbalanced drilling. Foam fluids {{generally}} consist of 5 – 25  % of the liquid phase and 75 – 95  % of the gaseous phase. The liquid phase could be fresh water or brines. The gaseous phase is usually an inert gas. A surfactant {{is used as a}} stabilizer and it comprises about 5  % of the liquid phase. The liquid phase can be weighted up using heavy brines or barites. The advantages of foam drilling over conventional mud drilling include high penetration rates, a high cuttings transport ratio, and less formation damage. For the drilling with low bottom-hole pressures, the use of a lighter fluid, such as foam, is required (Zhu et al. 1995; Teichrob and Manuel 1997; Foster and Steiner 2007; Ramalho 2006; Chen 2005; Wang et al. 2009 b). In drilling operation, the fluid is pumped through the drill pipe down to the hole. Then the fluid with cuttings is circulated back up to the surface through the annular space between the drill pipe and the hole. Cuttings transport as a multiphase flow, is important to successful drilling operation, which can affect the operation cost, the time, and the quality of well drilling and completion. Inadequate hole cleaning can result in many costly problems, such as pipe stuck, lost circulation, premature bit wear, slow penetration rate, poor cement jobs, formation fracturing, high torque and high drag. Cuttings transport is controlled by many variables, such as the well deviation <b>angle,</b> <b>hole</b> diameter, drill pipe diameter, drill pipe rotation, drill pipe eccentricity, rate of penetration (ROP), cuttings characteristics (including the size, shape and porosity of bed), fluid velocity, fluid type, and the complex non-Newtonian fluid rheology. A comprehensive review of the cuttings transport was given by Nazari et al. (2010). Much research has been carried out on cuttings transport with conventional drilling fluids in horizontal and directional wells. In addition, some empirical and mechanistic models have been developed for cuttings transport (Clark and Bickham 1994; Larsen et al. 1997; Nguyen and Rahman 1998; Kelessidis and Bandelis 2004; Loureiro et al. 2010; Piroozian et al. 2012). Foam as a non-Newtonian pseudo-plastic fluid has high viscosity. Its viscosity is greater than either its liquid or gaseous components. Its density is usually less than one-half that of water. Therefore, foam could promote efficient cuttings transport. Its low density allows for underbalanced conditions, an increased ROP, and minimal formation damage. Foams are also stable at high temperatures and pressures (Ozbayoglu 2002; Ozbayoglu et al. 2005; Chen 2005; Duan 2007).The rheological properties and hydraulic of foam have been studied much less than conventional (incompressible) drilling fluids. Even less is known about the cuttings transport capabilities of foam. Determining how to effectively remove cuttings with foam is critical to the drilling process. The cuttings particles with the foam drilling fluid could create problems similar to those with conventional drilling fluid. The solids particles can also change foam properties, which may completely alter the plan for controlling down-hole pressure. The majority of research related to cuttings transport with foam describes operators’ experiences, field practices, and one-dimensional numerical simulations of the cuttings transport process (Machado and Ikoku 1982; Owayed 1997; Saintpere et al. 2000; Martins et al. 2001; Ozbayoglu 2002; Ahmed et al. 2003; Li and Kuru 2003; Chen 2005; Capo et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2007; Osunde and Kuru 2008; Wang et al. 2009 b; Duan 2007; Duan et al. 2010; Gumati and Takahshi 2011).|$|E

There are seven holes in a row on each plate and each hole is 4 mm in diameter. The blowing ratio effect is studied at 10 different blowing ratios ranging from M = 0. 3 to M = 2. 0. The coolant to main stream density ratio (DR) effect is studied by using foreign gases with DR = 1 (N 2), 1. 5 (CO_ 2), and 2 (15 % SF 6 + 85 % Ar). The free stream turbulence intensity effect is tested at 0. 5 % and 6 %. The results of the parametric effects to the film cooling effectiveness with forward injection agreed with open literatures. In general, the results show the film cooling effectiveness with backward injection is greatly reduced for shaped holes {{as compared with the}} forward injection. However, significant improvements can be seen in simple <b>angled</b> cylindrical <b>hole</b> at higher blowing ratios. Backward injection also shows improvements at near film-hole regions for compound <b>angled</b> cylindrical <b>holes</b> at higher blowing ratios. Comparison was made between the experimental data and empirical correlation for simple <b>angled</b> fan-shaped <b>holes...</b>|$|R

The experimental test results show that an increasing laser drilling speed caused a reduction in corrosion fatigue life by 30 - 50 % at 850 °C, under low cycle fatigue regime. This reduction was found to correlate directly with the recast layer thickness and surface anomalies within the recast layer produced during the laser drilling process. Corrosion had a smaller effect on the overall life of the laser drilled specimens under the conditions tested. The results presented show that laser trepanning speedis influencial in limiting the life performance of laser drilled components in service...|$|R

With this aim we have applied thermographic particle image velocimetry (thermographic PIV) to investigate the flow emanating from angled and trenched cooling holes in a closed-loop optically-accessible wind tunnel facility. BAM:Eu 2 + thermographic phosphor particles were seeded into the flow as a tracer. A pulsed high-speed UV laser was used to excite the particles and the luminescence was detected using two high-speed cameras to determine the temperature field by a two-colour ratiometric approach. The velocity field was measured using ordinary high-speed PIV. The simultaneously measured fields were sampled {{at a rate of}} 6 kHz in a vertical plane through the centreline of the symmetrical single-row cooling holes. The flowrate and temperature of the cooling air and heated main flow were chosen to achieve density and momentum flux ratios of 1. 6 and 8 respectively. For these conditions the average and RMS temperature fields show that for ordinary <b>angled</b> <b>holes</b> the jet is detached from the surface. In contrast, the trenched geometry leads to a cooling film attached to the surface. However, time-resolved image sequences show instances where hot air breaks through the cooling film and almost reaches the surface. Similar image sequences for the <b>angled</b> <b>holes</b> show that the detached coolant jet becomes unstable downstream and pockets of cold air are ejected into the main flow. This intermittency may in part explain the observation that the measured turbulent heat flux is oriented towards the cold core, but deviates {{from the direction of the}} mean temperature gradient, thereby contradicting the simple gradient diffusion hypothesis commonly used in RANS simulations...|$|R
50|$|Some {{individuals}} have complained about persistent soreness {{in the area}} spanning a year or more, migration, {{and in some cases}} even rejection. While some of these issues can arise from improper aftercare and careless handling, many times they are the result of improper placement or poorly suited anatomy. Depending on the size and thickness of one's antihelix in this area, the increased curvature of a CBR (as opposed to a curved barbell) can put undue strain on the healing fistula which can prolong soreness and promote migration. Rejection will only occur in the most extreme of circumstances, usually because of poor placement (too shallow or oddly <b>angled</b> <b>hole)</b> or extreme trauma inflicted on the piercing especially during healing. In general, a person with decent health and proper hygiene is unlikely to experience any complications or pain outside of the normal healing process.|$|R

The results were derived in the form of Miner’s damage under the passage of a typical freight train. Through this ranking and by considering different damage scenarios, including rivet defects, loss of clamping force in a rivet and loss of a rivet, {{it was found that the}} most damaging effect was caused by the presence of clearance between the rivet shank and the hole or by the loss of a rivet. The damage at the angle-fillet and the rivets connecting the angle to the stringer web was found not to be affected considerably by rivet defects. In contrast, the rivet clamping force appeared to affect fatigue damage around the <b>angle</b> <b>holes</b> and on the rivets to a considerable extent.

40|$|A {{concept for}} {{mitigating}} {{the adverse effects}} of jet vorticity and liftoff at high blowing ratios for turbine film cooling flows has been developed and studied at NASA Glenn Research Center. This "anti-vortex" film cooling concept proposes the addition of two branched holes from each primary hole {{in order to produce}} a vorticity counter to the detrimental kidney vortices from the main jet. These vortices typically entrain hot freestream gas and are associated with jet separation from the turbine blade surface. The anti-vortex design is unique in that it requires only easily machinable round holes, unlike shaped film cooling holes and other advanced concepts. The anti-vortex film cooling hole concept has been modeled computationally for a single row of 30 deg <b>angled</b> <b>holes</b> on a flat surface using the 3 D Navier-Stokes solver Glenn-HT. A modification of the anti-vortex concept whereby the branched holes exit adjacent to the main hole has been studied computationally for blowing ratios of 1. 0 and 2. 0 and at density ratios of 1. 0 and 2. 0. This modified concept was selected because it has shown the most promise in recent experimental studies. The computational results show that the modified design improves the film cooling effectiveness relative to the round hole baseline and previous anti-vortex cases, in confirmation of the experimental studies...|$|R
