5|$|The Pacific {{angelshark}} {{was first}} scientifically described in 1859 by William Orville Ayres, the first Curator of Ichthyology at the California Academy of Sciences. He {{gave it the}} specific epithet californica, as the originally-described specimen was caught off San Francisco. Locally, this species may also {{be referred to as}} <b>angel</b> <b>shark,</b> California <b>angel</b> <b>shark,</b> or monkfish.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA, {{has concluded that}} the sand devil and the Pacific <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> (S. californica) are sister species. The {{two of them in}} turn form a clade with other angel sharks found in the Americas. Molecular clock estimation has timed the divergence of S. dumeril and S. californica at c. 6.1 Ma, around the time that the Isthmus of Panama formed. The rise of the Isthmus likely split the ancestral <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> population, leading to their becoming separate species.|$|E
5|$|Using {{mitochondrial}} DNA, a 2010 phylogenetic analysis {{reported that}} the Japanese angelshark forms a clade with the other Asian angelsharks included in the study: the ocellated angelshark (S. tergocellatoides) and the sister species pair of the Taiwan angelshark (S. formosa) and the Indonesian angelshark (S. legnota). These Asian species are, in turn, allied with European and North African <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> species. Molecular clock estimation suggested the Japanese angelshark lineage diverged {{from the rest of}} the Asian angelsharks some 100 million years ago during the Cretaceous.|$|E
50|$|The order Squatiniformes {{is a small}} {{order of}} highly {{specialized}} and recognizable <b>sharks</b> called <b>angel</b> <b>sharks.</b> The <b>angel</b> <b>sharks</b> have flattened bodies and broad pectoral fins, as well as camouflaged coloration.

5|$|Angel sharks {{in general}} are highly {{threatened}} by commercial trawl fisheries due to their susceptibility to capture and low rate of reproduction, and <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> species elsewhere {{are known to have}} declined markedly under fishing pressure. Trawling activity in the Yellow Sea {{and other parts of the}} northwestern Pacific is intense and, coupled with pollution, has had a serious impact on the local ecosystem. The Japanese angelshark population is suspected to have declined by up to 50% or more under these conditions, leading the species to be assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It may benefit from a ban on trawling imposed in some areas by the Chinese government, though enforcement is inconsistent.|$|E

5|$|The Chilean {{angelshark}} (Squatina armata) of {{the southeastern}} Pacific was synonymized with this species by Kato, Springer and Wagner in 1967, but was later tentatively recognized as a separate species again by Leonard Compagno. The taxonomic status of <b>angel</b> <b>sharks</b> in the southeastern Pacific – whether they are S. californica, S. armata, or if {{there is more than}} one Squatina species in the region – remains unresolved. The <b>angel</b> <b>sharks</b> inhabiting the Gulf of California may also represent a different species, as they mature at a much smaller size than those from the rest of their range.|$|R
5|$|Some seabed–dwelling {{species are}} highly {{effective}} ambush predators. <b>Angel</b> <b>sharks</b> and wobbegongs use camouflage {{to lie in}} wait and suck prey into their mouths. Many benthic sharks feed solely on crustaceans which they crush with their flat molariform teeth.|$|R
500|$|The Japanese {{angelshark}} is {{native to}} the cooler waters of the northwestern Pacific; its range extends from the eastern coast of Honshu, Japan, to Taiwan, and includes the southern Sea of Japan, the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the Taiwan Strait. Some older sources reported it may occur in the Philippines, but recent research suggests the only <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> species in that area is S. caillieti. The Japanese angelshark inhabits the continental shelf, usually in the shallows, but also to as deep as [...] It is a bottom-dweller found over sandy bottoms, often close to rocky reefs.|$|E
500|$|German naturalists Marcus Elieser Bloch and Johann Gottlob Schneider {{described}} the bowmouth guitarfish in their 1801 Systema Ichthyologiae. Their account {{was based on}} a [...] long specimen, now lost, collected off the Coromandel Coast of India. The genus name Rhina comes from the Greek rhinos ("snout"); the specific epithet ancylostoma is derived from the Greek ankylos ("curved" [...] or [...] "crooked") and stoma ("mouth"). Although Block and Schneider wrote the epithet as ancylostomus and that form appears in some literature, most modern sources regard the correct form to be ancylostoma. Other common names for this species include shark ray, mud skate, shortnose mud skate, bow-mouthed angel fish, and bow-mouthed <b>angel</b> <b>shark.</b>|$|E
500|$|The sand devil or Atlantic <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> (Squatina dumeril) is {{a species}} of angelshark, family Squatinidae, native to the northwestern Atlantic Ocean. It occurs off the eastern United States, in the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, and possibly {{in parts of the}} Caribbean Sea. This bottom-dwelling shark is found in shallow inshore waters in summer and fall, and deep offshore waters in winter and spring. The sand devil's flattened body and enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins give it a ray-like appearance. There is a band of enlarged thorns running along the middle of its back. It is gray or brown in color, with scattered small dark spots. This species reaches [...] in length.|$|E

500|$|In 1991, {{the use of}} {{gillnets}} in nearshore Californian waters {{was banned}} by a voter initiative (Proposition 132); the restricted area included much of the Pacific angelshark's habitat and reduced fishing pressure on the species. As a result, Pacific angelshark landings dropped further to [...] dressed in 1994, when the central Californian halibut/angel shark fishery was closed completely, and have remained low since. The decline of the Californian fishery led to the industry shifting to Mexico, where gillnet pangas (artisanal fishing vessels) targeting this species now meet most of the <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> demand in California. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened; Pacific angelshark numbers off California appear to be increasing and demographic modeling suggests the stock is healthy. However, {{the impact of the}} intense, unregulated Mexican fishery on the global population is yet undetermined. There is continuing interest in California for a resumption of the commercial fishery, though conservation concerns have thus far taken precedence.|$|E
500|$|Angelsharks are aplacental viviparous, {{meaning the}} young hatch inside the mother's uterus and are nourished by a yolk sac until birth. Females have two {{functional}} ovaries, {{with the right}} ovary containing more oocytes and the right uterus correspondingly containing more embryos; this functional asymmetry is not present in other <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> species. Unlike most sharks, in which vitellogenesis (yolk formation) occurs concurrently with pregnancy, in the angelshark, the onset of vitellogenesis is delayed until halfway through the gestation period. The mature ova measure [...] across and are not enclosed in a capsule. The reproductive cycle has been estimated at 2 years with ovulation taking place in spring, though this periodicity is ill-defined. The litter size ranges from seven to 25 and is correlated {{with the size of}} the mother; the young are gestated for 8–10 months. Parturition occurs from December to February in the Mediterranean and in July off England, with the newborns measuring [...] long. Males and females mature at lengths of [...] and , respectively.|$|E
