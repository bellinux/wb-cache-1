5|$|Gliding did {{not return}} to the Olympics after the war for two reasons: a {{shortage}} of gliders, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> agree on a single model of competition glider. (Some in the community feared doing so would hinder development of new designs.) The re-introduction of air sports such as gliding to the Olympics has occasionally been proposed by the world governing body, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), but has been rejected on the grounds of lack of public interest.|$|E
5|$|The IndyCar series had not visited Detroit since 2008, when Justin Wilson won {{the race}} after taking {{the lead in the}} last 20 laps when Hélio Castroneves was penalized for {{blocking}} him. The following year's scheduled race was cancelled due to lack of funding, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> secure sponsorship for the event. In September 2011, the Detroit City Council approved plans for the race to be held on the weekend of June 1–3, 2012. A month later, it was confirmed that the race would be run in 2012, sponsored by the Chevrolet arm of Detroit-based manufacturer General Motors.|$|E
5|$|Battleship {{doctrine}} emphasised {{the concentration}} of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated force {{to be able to}} bring its power to bear on a reluctant opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages battlecruisers, cruisers, destroyers, airships, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of radio, direction finding and traffic analysis would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.) So for most of their history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat of mine and torpedo attack, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques, seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.|$|E

5|$|Casualties of the {{operation}} were not high on either side. British losses in the landing party amounted to 15 killed and 58 wounded, with an additional three missing. The naval squadron suffered no known casualties in the engagement, principally {{because they did not}} come under heavy fire. French losses have not been calculated, but apart from General DesBruslys were probably a similar figure to the British. In contrast, the damage to the morale of the French defenders of Île Bonaparte was severe: the death of DesBruslys <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> properly defend the town undermined their efforts {{to such a degree that}} the eventual invasion of the island in 1810 was carried out without significant fighting or loss. This invasion force was similar in size to the raiding party and was once again led by Rowley and Keating.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Mashbir {{returned}} to Japan after an 11-year absence {{in a second}} attempt to launch the M-Plan {{on behalf of the}} Office of Naval Intelligence and his friend, naval attaché Zacharias. At that time, there was still hope that war between Japan and America might still be prevented. This mission aroused suspicions among ill-informed military attachés in Tokyo and an investigation was started into Mashbir. In a misunderstanding that would come close to damaging his career irreparably once more, Mashbir was investigated in Hawaii and, influenced by the military attaché suspicions, a prejudicial report based upon erroneous assumptions was delivered on 24 June 1937. Colonel Mashbir was advised on 25 February 1939 that he was disenrolled from the Military Intelligence Division G2 Reserves for failure to report on the specified day for physical examination. However, it appeared that the actual cause of the disenrollment was due to suspicions aroused by failure to communicate to uninformed individuals the nature and the extent of the work on which he was actually engaged. Mashbir's dismissal <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> implement an intelligence network such as that suggested in Mashbir's M-Plan {{has been described as a}} key factor in the United States' failure to have more information on Japan before the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} master plan granted outline planning permission for a 250-bed hotel {{of five to}} six storeys in height. However, property development and investment company The Beetham Organization Ltd, which has in recent years built several high-profile hotels, offices and other buildings in prominent city-centre locations in Britain, bought Block J in November 2004 and submitted a revised planning application (BH2005/00136/FP) early in 2005. This sought approval for a mixed-use development comprising one 42-storey building with 146 residential units (C3-category) and a hotel with ancillary facilities including a restaurant, cafés, conference facilities and a health and fitness centre; one six-storey building with retail units (A1- and A3-category) and a further 25 residential units; and a pedestrianised public square. The application was rejected on 20 separate counts, including the negative visual impact on surrounding listed buildings such as the railway station and St Bartholomew's Church; the reduction in quality of surrounding public spaces; the lack of provision of outdoor recreation space; {{negative effect on the}} surrounding microclimate, and loss of sunlight to nearby buildings; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> consider fully the impact on transport. The reasons for the rejection were supported by various people and groups within the city, such as The Regency Society, which is involved with planning and conservation matters in Brighton and Hove.|$|E

5|$|Without {{swearing}} {{allegiance to}} Edward III, David was released for a ransom of 100,000 marks in 1357, {{but he was}} unable to pay, resulting in secret negotiations with the English and attempts to secure succession to the Scottish throne for an English king. Major issues were his marriages <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> produce an heir. His first wife, Joan, the sister of Edward III, left him for England sometime after his return and she died without children in 1362. His planned second marriage to Margaret, the widow of the knight Sir John Logie, resulted in a factional division that alienated nobles including Robert Steward. Eventually the king backed the queen's opponents and attempted to divorce her. She fled to the continent and appealed to the Pope for support. Before he could marry again David died, apparently unexpectedly, bringing the Bruce dynasty to an end.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{such diverse}} {{projects}} as the {{alignment of the}} Zürichsee-Gotthard railroad track along Mount Rigi, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> construct a railroad up Mount Rigi departing from Greppen, tourism is not as important in Greppen {{as it is in}} nearby municipalities.

25|$|The most {{affected}} regions were neighbourhoods in Delhi. Human rights organisations and the newspapers believe the massacre was organised. The collusion of political {{officials in the}} massacres <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> prosecute any killers alienated normal Sikhs and increased support for the Khalistan movement. The Akal Takht, the governing religious body of Sikhism, considers the killings to be a genocide.|$|E
25|$|While some {{military}} historians {{point out that}} leaving enemies in your rear is not generally wise, the Mongols proved that indirect attack, and bypassing weaker foes to eliminate the strongest first, can be a devastatingly effective mode of invasion.

25|$|Azad Hind's {{military}} forces {{in the form of}} the INA saw some successes against the British, and moved with the Japanese army to lay siege to the town of Imphal in eastern India. Plans to march towards Delhi, gaining support and fresh recruits along the way, stalled both with the onset of monsoon season <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> capture Imphal. British bombing seriously reduced morale, and the Japanese along with the INA forces began their withdrawal from India.|$|E
25|$|Historian David Maraniss cites {{milestones}} in 1962-64 {{that marked}} the city's sharp decline: {{the failure of a}} plan to host the Olympics; urban renewal uprooting black neighborhoods; urgently needed police reforms that stalled; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> transform Detroit through the Model Cities and War on Poverty programs. Tensions started building that exploded in the 1967 riot, the most costly and violent in the country during a summer of numerous riots in cities.|$|E

25|$|Israeli {{schools and}} {{universities}} {{have been subject to}} repeated strikes over the years by faculty, and, occasionally, by students.

After three weeks, the universities threatened that all students who failed to return to their studies would have to retake the semester. Student leaders rejected a compromise which would have exempted students from the fee rises. Some students started a hunger strike.|$|E
25|$|This {{model has}} been well-supported so far by the {{distribution}} of short GRB host galaxies, which have been observed in old galaxies with no star formation (for example, GRB050509B, the first short burst to be localized to a probable host) {{as well as in}} galaxies with star formation still occurring (such as GRB050709, the second), as even younger-looking galaxies can have significant populations of old stars. However, the picture is clouded somewhat by the observation of X-ray flaring in short GRBs out to very late times (up to many days), long after the merger should have been completed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> find nearby hosts of any sort for some short GRBs.|$|E
