40|$|Due to a {{singularity}} in {{the governing}} three-dimensional turbulent momentum integral equations at the <b>attachment</b> <b>line,</b> low order infinite-swept and swept-tapered CFD methods employing the viscous-coupling technique {{have been unable}} to model <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> transition or contamination without approximating the development of the boundary layer immediately downstream of a turbulent <b>attachment</b> <b>line.</b> An experimental study was therefore conducted to explore the flow near a turbulent <b>attachment</b> <b>line,</b> which showed considerable differences to the numerical approximation. On the basis of the experimental data; a modification to the governing equations in the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> region has been proposed and tested. Comparisons with experimental measurements show that the proposed numerical model is not only able to predict the flow to within ± 5 %, but it also captures the non-monotonic behaviour of the momentum thickness, {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>attachment</b> <b>line,</b> which has not been reported previously...|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{evolution}} of three-dimensional disturbances in an attachment-line boundary layer {{is computed by}} direct numerical simulation of the unsteady, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Disturbances are introduced into the boundary layer by harmonic sources that involve unsteady suction and blowing through the wall. Various harmonic- source generators are implemented {{on or near the}} <b>attachment</b> <b>line,</b> and the disturbance evolutions are compared. Previous two-dimensional simulation results and nonparallel theory are compared with the present results. The three-dimensional simulation results for disturbances with quasi-two-dimensional features indicate growth rates of only a few percent larger than pure two-dimensional results; however, the results are close enough to enable the use of the more computationally efficient, two-dimensional approach. However, true three-dimensional disturbances are more likely in practice and are more stable than two-dimensional disturbances. Disturbances generated off (but near) the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> spread both away from and toward the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> as they evolve. The evolution pattern is comparable to wave packets in at-plate boundary-layer flows. Suction stabilizes the quasi-two-dimensional attachment-line instabilities, and blowing destabilizes these instabilities; these results qualitatively agree with the theory. Furthermore, suction stabilizes the disturbances that develop off the <b>attachment</b> <b>line.</b> Clearly, disturbances that are generated near the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> can supply energy to attachment-line instabilities, but suction can be used to stabilize these instabilities...|$|E

Second, we improve significantly standard stream surface computation schemes to achieve accurate integration even in regions exhibiting complex structures. Additional state-of-the-art flow visualization techniques are used to complete the study of the dataset.

The time dependent Navier-Stokes equations for the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> flow have been solved using a Fourier-Chebyshev spectral method and the subcritical instability is found at wavenumbers that correspond to the upper branch. Both the theory and the numerical calculations show the existence of supercritical finite amplitude (equilibrium) states near the lower branch which explains why the observed flow exhibits a preference for the lower branch modes.

40|$|The {{visualization}} of a three-dimensional viscous flow around an embedded object is typically {{based on the}} analysis of its wall shear stress. This vector field defined over the object body exhibits structures that are key to the qualitative evaluation of the surrounding flow. Open separation and <b>attachment</b> <b>lines</b> are of essential interest in aerodynamics due to their adverse effects on the object motion and their implication in vortex genesis. The paper presents a new method for the efficient analysis and {{visualization of}} separation and <b>attachment</b> <b>lines</b> on polyhedral surfaces in threespace. It combines local prediction and global feature extraction to yield a scheme that is both efficient and accurate. In particular, it does not suffer from the restrictions induced by assumptions of local linearity {{and is able to}} detect features where existing techniques fail. The algorithm is built upon an efficient streamline integration scheme on polyhedral surfaces. The latter is also employed to develop a variation of the LIC scheme.

40|$|This work is {{motivated}} by the need for low-order aerodynamic models to predict accurately the effect on profile drag of controlling <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> transition. Head's entrainment method (1), a rapid integral boundary layer technique used for design studies on swept wings, suffers from the governing swept-tapered turbulent integral boundary layer equations being ill-posed {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>attachment</b> <b>line.</b> This singularity has been treated using crude extrapolations of the attachment-line similarity solution for over half a century, but this approach is unlikely to deliver accurate predictions of the effect of changes in the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> flow on profile drag. An experimental study has been carried out to explore the nature of the turbulent flow in the vicinity of a highly swept swept <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> and has revealed a quite complex, non-monotonic development of the momentum thickness in this region. It has also revealed lower levels of twist in the boundary layer velocity profiles than anticipated from the highly curved character of the inviscid flow streamlines. These observations have prompted an alternative approach to the modelling of the flow in this region which not only successfully eliminates the lack of robustness in the swept-tapered equations but which also matches the experimental results to within ± 5 %...|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} on a 76 degree swept cylinder to establish {{the behavior of the}} <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> transition process in a low-disturbance level, Mach number 1. 6 flow. For a near adiabatic wall condition, the attachment-line boundary layer remained laminar up to the highest attainable Reynolds number. The attachment-line boundary layer transition under the influence of trip wires depended on wind tunnel disturbance level, and a transition onset condition for this flow is established. Internal heating raised the surface temperature of the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> to induce boundary layer instabilities.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the effect of velocity and sweep angle on the critical distance in ice accretion formation on swept wings at glaze ice conditions. The critical distance {{is defined as the}} distance from the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> {{to the beginning of the}} zone where roughness elements develop into glaze ice feathers. Icing runs were performed on a NACA 00 1 2 swept wing tip at velocities of 75, 100, 150, and 200 miles per hour. At each velocity and tunnel condition, the sweep angle was changed from 0 deg to 45 deg at 5 deg increments. Casting data, ice shape tracings, and close-up photographic data were obtained. The results showed that at given velocity and tunnel conditions, as the sweep angle is increased from 0 deg to 25 deg the critical distance slowly decreases. As the sweep angle is increased past 25 deg, the critical distance starts decreasing more rapidly. For 75 and 100 mph it reaches a value of 0 millimeters at 35 deg. For 150 and 200 mph it reaches a value of 0 millimeters at 40 deg. On the ice accretion, as the sweep angle is increased from 0 deg to 25 deg, the extent of the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> zone slowly decreases.

The critical Reynolds number, R 9 L, of the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> boundary layer for the spanwise spread of turbulence was found to be about 100 for sweep angles in the range 40 °- 60 °.

40|$|AbstractThe large-eddy {{simulation}} (LES) {{technique is}} applied to the subcritical transition to turbulence of a finite-amplitude instability in the attachment-line boundary layer of a swept wing. The three-dimensional swept Hiemenz solution is used to model the base laminar flow along the leading edge of a swept wing. The filtered Navier-Stokes equations are solved numerically using a localized dynamic eddy-viscosity model to parameterize the unresolved scales. Outflow conditions are imposed using the buffer-domain technique, and initial disturbances are introduced through a blowing/suction strip. The linear stage of transition is bypassed due to the finite-amplitude perturbation. The instability growth rate is found to be significantly higher than in previous two-dimensional results, due to the commonly-made Görtler-Hümmerlin assumption that the perturbation has the same spanwise structure as the base flow; this assumption is not supported by our results, most probably due to the finite spanwise length of the blowing/suction strip. As the flow propagates downstream, energy is fed into the spanwise modes, and turbulence generated on the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> is transported to other spanwise locations by the mean motion in this direction. The shape factor on the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> matches the turbulent boundary layer estimates, while the turbulent mean-velocity profiles on the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> deviate from the universal logarithmic behavior due to the appearance of inflectional points, which make the flow susceptible to inviscid instabilities...|$|E
