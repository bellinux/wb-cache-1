25|$|More than 1/7 the {{capacity}} of the cylinder should not be used per hour. This causes the acetone inside the <b>acetylene</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{to come out of the}} cylinder and contaminate the hose and possibly the torch.|$|E
50|$|At around 8:00 am {{a worker}} was {{changing}} over an <b>acetylene</b> <b>cylinder</b> when the tank began to vent and ignited; {{this in turn}} ignited other venting tanks. On arrival of the brigade a 300 m cordon {{was put in place}} which required surrounding houses and the docks to be evacuated. The brigade extinguished the initial fire but then had to cool the cylinders constantly for 24 hours to prevent the cylinders from exploding due to the heat and pressure buildup. In total Cornwall FRS sent 6 pumping appliances, 1 command support unit, 1 operational support unit, 1 welfare vehicle. The incident lasted for 24 hours and required numerous relief crews to attend overnight.|$|E
40|$|We {{report an}} autopsy {{case of a}} male welder in his thirties who {{was found dead in}} an {{exploded}} truck cabin. The roof, windows and doors of the cabin had been blown up to 50 metres away. An oxygen cylinder and an <b>acetylene</b> <b>cylinder,</b> both unexploded, were found {{in the back of the}} truck. The deceased was lying on the driver’s seat. His entire body was burnt, carbonised and partially skeletonised. There was a small amount of soot in his oesophagus and stomach and a large volume of bloody fluid in the trachea and bronchi. There was an extensive haem-orrhage in the posterior thoracic wall. No drugs were detected in the blood. Hardly any carbon mon-oxide and combustion-related gases were detected in the blood, therefore he was not considered to have died from the fire. Acetylene was detected in his blood (21. 5 µg/ml in the femoral vein blood) and urine (7. 49 µg/ml), with marked haemorrhaging in his back. We therefore concluded that the victim died because of an acetylene explosion in the cabin and also that this was a suicide...|$|E
50|$|On 30 January 2008 {{there was}} an {{explosion}} and fire at Sutton Courtenay Tyres and petrol station, which led to about 100 nearby houses being evacuated for fears that <b>acetylene</b> <b>cylinders</b> might explode.|$|R

40|$|Acetylene {{generated}} from various grades of calcium carbide and obtained from commercial- and purified-grade <b>acetylene</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{was shown to}} contain high concentrations of various contaminants. Dependent on the source of acetylene, these included, at maximal values, H 2 (0. 023 %), O 2 (0. 779 %), N 2 (3. 78 %), PH 3 (0. 06 %), CH 4 (0. 073 %), and acetone (1 to 10 %). The concentration of the contaminants in <b>cylinder</b> <b>acetylene</b> was highly dependent {{on the extent of}} cylinder discharge. Several conventional methods used to partially purify <b>cylinder</b> <b>acetylene</b> were compared. A small-scale method for extensively purifying acetylene is described. An effect of acetylene quality on acetylene reduction assays conducted with purified nitrogenase from Azotobacter vinelandii was demonstrated...|$|R
50|$|Note: <b>Acetylene</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{contain an}} inert packing material, {{which may be}} agamassan, and are filled with a solvent such as acetone or dimethylformamide. The {{acetylene}} is pumped into the cylinder and it dissolves in the solvent. When the cylinder is opened the acetylene comes back out of solution, much like a carbonated beverage bubbles when opened. This is a workaround to acetylene's property to explode when pressurized above 200 kPa or liquified.|$|R
2500|$|On an {{oxyacetylene}} torch system {{there will be}} three types of valves, the tank valve, the regulator valve, and the torch valve. There will be a set of these three valves for each gas. The gas in the tanks or cylinders is at high pressure. Oxygen cylinders are generally filled to approximately 2200 psi. The regulator converts the high pressure gas to a low pressure stream suitable for welding. [...] <b>Acetylene</b> <b>cylinders</b> must be maintained in an upright position to prevent the internal acetone and acetylene from separating in the filler material.|$|R

25|$|Cylinders {{should be}} stored in an area {{segregated}} from oxidizers to avoid exacerbated reaction in case of fire/leakage. <b>Acetylene</b> <b>cylinders</b> should not {{be stored in}} confined spaces / enclosed vehicles / garages / buildings to avoid unintended leakage leading to explosive atmosphere. In the USA, National Electric Code (NEC) requires consideration for hazardous areas including those where acetylene may be released during accidents or leaks. Consideration may include electrical classification and use of listed Group A electrical components in USA. Further information on determining the areas requiring special consideration is in NFPA 497. In Europe, ATEX also requires consideration for hazardous areas where flammable gases may be released during accidents or leaks.|$|R
50|$|The first {{settlement}} of Point Lookout occurred in 1932 when a substantial concrete lighthouse was built. A lighthouse and signal station was proposed in 1825 {{but did not}} eventuate and in 1848 the pilot station was moved from Amity Point to Cape Moreton because the South Passage was considered too dangerous. A hut was built to store <b>acetylene</b> <b>cylinders</b> at Cylinder Beach, which derived its name from this usage. Shortly after {{the construction of the}} lighthouse Bertie Clayton established a guesthouse above Main Beach. Guests arrived at Amity Point by launch and were collected by him by car and taken back to the guesthouse either along the beach, or at high tide, along a track beside the swamp adjacent to the beach. Clayton's guests were accommodated in tents with timber floors that later evolved into tent-like huts with concrete walls and fibrous cement roofs.|$|R

2500|$|Acetylene is not {{especially}} toxic but, when generated from calcium carbide, it can contain toxic impurities such as traces of phosphine and arsine, which {{give it a}} distinct garlic-like smell [...] It is also highly flammable, as most light hydrocarbons, hence its use in welding. Its most singular hazard is associated with its intrinsic instability, especially when it is pressurized: under certain conditions acetylene can react in an exothermic addition-type reaction to form a number of products, typically benzene and/or vinylacetylene, possibly in addition to carbon and hydrogen [...] Consequently, acetylene, if initiated by intense heat or a shockwave, can decompose explosively if the absolute pressure of the gas exceeds about [...] Most regulators and pressure gauges on equipment report gauge pressure and the safe limit for acetylene therefore is 101 kPagage or 15 psig. It is therefore supplied and stored dissolved in acetone or dimethylformamide (DMF), contained in a gas cylinder with a porous filling (Agamassan), which renders it safe to transport and use, given proper handling. <b>Acetylene</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{should be used in}} the upright position to avoid withdrawing acetone during use.|$|R
50|$|Acetylene is also {{supplied}} differently. Since {{it is so}} {{unstable and}} explosive, this is supplied as a gas dissolved in acetone within a packing mass in a <b>cylinder.</b> <b>Acetylene</b> is also the only other common industrial gas that sublimes at atmospheric pressure.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the worst}} fires the Stockholm Fire Brigade {{experienced}} since its formation in 1875 was a fire in 1937 in the central dairy at Torsgatan. The fire broke out on February 8, 1937, caused by a welder working in the attic above the fourth floor. He first attempted to extinguish the fire himself, but failed. The fire brigade was alerted and quickly arrived on the site. The men not only had to fight the fire, but also work under difficult conditions, including heavy ice (the temperature was 10 degrees below zero) and a wax layer of 3,500 kg, which began to melt and burn, and hindered the firefighters considerably. Two firefighters were cut off by the fire. One hung outside a window and fell, later dying of his injuries. The other was rescued at the last minute. Some <b>acetylene</b> <b>cylinders</b> exploded, injuring another firefighter. A stairwell threatened to collapse and officers had to withdraw the men. In the end, all of Stockholm's firefighters engaged in fire extinguishing, and all the firefighters were called to duty. In total, there were 70 people on the site, including managers, the fire chief, firefighters, and teachers from officers' school. Only after seven hours was the fire considered to be under control. The damage cost {{over a million dollars}} and Stockholm's milk supply was threatened.|$|R
25|$|Changes {{were made}} in the 2005/06 {{academic}} year which cut the lunch break from 1 hour to 45 mins so that the school day finished at 3.00pm rather than 3.15pm. In January 2007 the school was at scene of a BBC London news report after a gas explosion scare in nearby South Green, down Southend Road. The school was used to house those evacuated from the surrounding area. No explosion from the <b>acetylene</b> and oxygen <b>cylinders</b> occurred but one man suffered burns from the fire. The scare scene was 3 houses away from the South Green Memorial Hall.|$|R
50|$|Members of {{the special}} defence section assess {{of the impact of}} chemical, {{biological}} and radioactive contamination, using measuring devices to control the level of hazardous materials in the environment. In addition, specialists in this section participate in rescue operations in chemical accidents. Since 2006, the ARRS has mitigated dangerous substances. Decontamination services were not provided in the Arkhangelsk region before the formation of the ARRS. From 2006 to 2011, specialists of the ARRS mitigated adverse effects from 46 damaged methyl bromide cylinders, 1820 chlorine cylinders, 800 liquid chlorine containers, 29 ammonia cylinders, 7.5 tons compressed and ammonia gas from refrigeration equipment, 5 <b>acetylene,</b> 5 hydrogen <b>cylinders,</b> and 5 methane cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|On 23 March 1967, {{the worst}} ground {{aviation}} accident of the Vietnam War occurred at Da Nang Air Base, South Vietnam when a traffic controller cleared USMC A-6A Intruder, BuNo 152608, of VMA(AW)-242, MAG-11, for takeoff but also cleared USAF C-141A-LM Starlifter, AF serial number 65-9407, of the 62nd Military Airlift Wing, McChord AFB, Washington, {{to cross the}} runway. The A-6's crew saw the Starlifter {{at the last moment}} and veered off of the runway to try to avoid the collision, but despite this, the A-6's port wing sliced through the C-141's nose, which immediately caught fire. The C-141's load of 72 <b>acetylene</b> gas <b>cylinders</b> ignited and caused a tremendous explosion. Only the loadmaster survived, escaping through the rear hatch. The A-6 overturned and skidded down the runway on its back, but both its crewmembers, Capt. Frederick Cone and Capt. Doug Wilson, survived, crawling out of the smashed canopy after the jet came to a halt. Some of the A-6's ordnance load of bombs and rocket packs went off in the ensuing fire. The Military Airlift Command crew killed were Capt. Harold Leland Hale, Capt. Leroy Edward Leonard, Capt. Max Paul Starkel, SSgt. Alanson Garland Bynum, and SSgt. Alfred Funck. This was the first of two C-141s lost during the conflict, and one of only three strategic airlifters written off during the Vietnam War.|$|R
