5|$|An unusual slapstick mix of film noir, black {{comedy and}} B-movie conventions, the film portrays bizarre {{situations}} involving a death row inmate. The film was a box-office flop, {{and has since}} fallen into obscurity outside of fans of Campbell and Raimi. Few critics reviewed the film, though the little amount of critical attention it received was mostly negative. Several elements of the film influenced later productions by Raimi, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> Crimewave directly led to the inception of Evil Dead II (1987). The film has achieved {{the status of a}} minor cult film.|$|E
5|$|Archie Clement led {{the guerrillas}} after Anderson's death, {{but the group}} {{splintered}} by mid-November. Most Confederate guerrillas lost heart around that time, owing to a cold winter <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> General Price's 1864 Missouri campaign, which ensured that the state would remain under Union control. As the Confederacy collapsed, most of Anderson's men joined Quantrill's forces or traveled to Texas. Jim Anderson moved to Sherman, Texas, with his two sisters.|$|E
5|$|David Cameron criticised the Labour Government's {{criminal}} justice system {{and the absence of}} father-figures in ethnic minority cultures, which he claimed as causes in the murder of Pryce. Cameron stated that lack of strong deterrent sentences for knife crimes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> police to stop prolific criminals had {{played a role in the}} killing of Pryce. He insisted that parental background had a key role in preventing crime and called for zero tolerance of knife crime, claiming that not enough criminals were being sent to jail.|$|E

50|$|Through the mid-1970s, {{conflicts}} between governments and Native Americans occasionally erupted into violence.

5|$|Despite {{favorable}} {{reviews of}} her performances in The Big Knife and Peter Pan, her worsening health <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> {{her most recent}} Broadway plays took a toll on her career. As her health declined, she found that her dancing ability was affected. She suffered a severe heart attack in 1955, followed by a possible second attack, and then developed pneumonia which required an extended stay in the hospital. She hid the severity of her health problems, but some details became public. Upon release from the hospital, McCracken was told by her doctors that {{she could no longer}} dance. The news was devastating to her.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, {{there was a}} growing number of intellectuals (Samir Kassir, Ziad Majed, Elias Khoury) and a network of {{independent}} student groups ("Independent Leftist Groups") who advocated democracy, individual liberties, secularism and center-left economic policies in Lebanon. On the other hand, a growing number Lebanese Communist Party (LCP) members were dissatisfied with the status of their party: the rise of Islamic Fundamentalism, the fall of the Soviet Union, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the LCP to assume a more democratic socialist platform ushered in an era of political decline for the party. This, coupled with perceived Syrian domination of its leadership, led to increasing frustration among rank-and-file communists against the upper echelons of the party.|$|E

5|$|The 61st Battalion was {{initially}} {{raised in the}} United Kingdom in February 1917 {{as part of the}} Australian Imperial Force (AIF) during the First World War in an effort to raise the 6th Division. However, following manpower shortages that occurred as a result of heavy losses amongst the AIF on the Western Front in 1917 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> attempts to introduce conscription in Australia, it was decided to disband the division and its subordinate units in September 1917 and use their personnel to reinforce other units. As a result, the 61st Battalion was disbanded without seeing active service.|$|E
5|$|The Bribery Act 2010 (c.23) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} the {{criminal}} law relating to bribery. Introduced to Parliament in the Queen's Speech in 2009 after several decades of reports and draft bills, the Act received the Royal Assent on 8 April 2010 following cross-party support. Initially scheduled to enter into force in April 2010, this was changed to 1 July 2011. The Act repeals all previous statutory and common law provisions in relation to bribery, instead replacing them with the crimes of bribery, being bribed, the bribery of foreign public officials, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> a commercial organisation to prevent bribery on its behalf.|$|E
5|$|The French {{defenders}} of the town, despite initially resisting the attack, were unable to prevent the seizure of the port's defensive fortifications. The British force later withdrew {{under pressure from the}} main garrison of the island, burning warehouses containing over £500,000 worth of silk captured from British merchant ships. Ultimately the French were unable to effectively oppose the invasion, the island's governor General Des Bruslys retreating to Saint-Denis rather than engage the British and later committing suicide. The transportation of forces from the recently captured island of Rodrigues, the co-ordination of land and naval forces <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the French defenders to co-ordinate an effective response were all features of the subsequent invasion and capture of Île Bonaparte in July 1810.|$|E

5|$|The {{aquaculture}} {{potential for}} sand whiting was first investigated {{in the late}} 1980s, {{with a number of}} reports detailing both successful trials and also a number of problems with such trials. A 1988 study showed that sand whiting were more likely to grow in captivity than other whiting species, but the mortality rate of over 50% was unacceptable for use in an economic setting. A number of problems with diseases such as ulcerative dermatitis <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the swim-bladder to inflate properly were also documented, however many of these initial problems have been overcome, and some facilities are breeding around 2000 larvae with a 95% survival rate.

He said he wanted to prove to himself that he could still play at the NHL level, though his skeptics pointed to his child support payments <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> his concrete business, as well as the planned release of his autobiography, and argued Fleury's comeback was financially motivated.|$|E

5|$|After {{his early}} {{release from prison}} for {{political}} crimes in 1924, over {{the second half of}} the 1920s, Gandhi continued to pursue swaraj. He pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India dominion status or face a new campaign of non-co-operation with complete independence for the country as its goal. After his support for the World War I with Indian combat troops, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> Khilafat movement in preserving the rule of Caliph in Turkey, followed by a collapse in Muslim support for his leadership, some such as Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh questioned his values and non-violent approach.

5|$|Despite Arnold's successes, he {{was passed}} over for {{promotion}} by the Continental Congress, while other officers claimed credit for some of his accomplishments. Adversaries in military and political circles brought charges of corruption or other malfeasance, but most often he was acquitted in formal inquiries. Congress investigated his accounts and concluded that he was indebted to Congress (he also {{had spent much of}} his own money on the war effort). Arnold was frustrated and bitter at this, {{as well as with the}} alliance with France <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> Congress to accept Britain's 1778 proposal to grant full self-governance in the colonies. He decided to change sides, and opened secret negotiations with the British. In July 1780, he was awarded command of West Point. His scheme was to surrender the fort to the British, but it was exposed when American forces captured British Major John André carrying papers which revealed the plot. Upon learning of André's capture, Arnold fled down the Hudson River to the British sloop-of-war Vulture, narrowly avoiding capture by the forces of George Washington, who had been alerted to the plot.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} to Singapore the 8th Division was deployed {{to defend the}} island's north-west coast. Due to the casualties suffered in Johore most of the division's units were at half-strength. The commander of the Singapore fortress, Lieutenant General Arthur Ernest Percival, believed that the Japanese would land on the north-east coast of the island and deployed the near full-strength British 18th Division to defend this sector. The Japanese landing on 8 February {{took part in the}} Australian sector, however, and the 8th Division was forced from its positions after just two days of heavy fighting. The division was also unable to turn back the Japanese landing at Kranji and withdrew to the centre of the island. After further fighting in which the Commonwealth forces were pushed into a narrow perimeter around the urban area of Singapore, Percival surrendered his forces on 15 February. Following the surrender 14,972Australians were taken prisoner, though some escaped on ships. These escapees included Major General Bennett, who was found by two post-war inquiries to have been unjustified in leaving his command. The loss of almost a quarter of Australia's overseas soldiers, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the Singapore Strategy that had permitted it to accept the sending of the AIF to aid Britain, stunned the country.|$|E
