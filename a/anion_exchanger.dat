The resulting S-nitrosylated hemoglobin influences various NO-related activities such as the control of vascular resistance, blood pressure and respiration.

5000|$|The human <b>anion</b> <b>exchanger</b> 1 (AE1 or Band 3) binds {{carbonic}} anhydrase II (CAII) {{forming a}} [...] "transport metabolon" [...] as CAII binding activates AE1 transport activity about 10 fold.

According to the model of Zhu et al. (2003), AE1 in humans spans the membrane 16 times, 13 times as α-helix, and three times (TMSs 10, 11 and 14) possibly as β-strands.

The contact of the chloride rhodium complexes with sorbents leads to the change of the metal reactivity.
