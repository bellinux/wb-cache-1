Previous work on Bacillus cereus has indicated that protein synthesis is partially inhibited {{in the presence of}} <b>azaguanine</b> and that {{the synthesis}} of penicillinase (penicillin amido-β-lactamhydrolase, EC 3. 5. 2. 6) is apparently more affected by the analog than {{the synthesis of}} other proteins. A search for the presence of an "abnormal" penicillinase under these conditions was made in the present work by immunological reactions and by column chromatography.

Accumulation of {{ribonucleic acid}} in {{bacterial}} nuclear preparations during treatment of whole cells with 8 -azaguanine, tetracyclines, and other inhibitors. J. Bacteriol. 87 : 755 – 760. 1964 —Ribonucleic acid (RNA), synthesized in Bacillus megaterium KM during chloramphenicol treatment, accumulates in the chromatin-containing cell fraction obtained by lipase treatment of protoplasts. To determine whether {{this phenomenon is}} the cause or an effect of the inhibition of protein synthesis, or neither, other inhibitors of protein synthesis were studied. Chloramphenicol, tetracyclines, <b>azaguanine,</b> and, to a lesser extent, 7 -azatryptophan permitted RNA synthesis while inhibiting protein synthesis. In each case, RNA accumulated in the chromatin body fraction. <b>Azaguanine</b> at 5 μg/ml causes more RNA accumulation than at 15 μg/ml, but allows some protein synthesis.

40|$|In bacteria, protein {{synthesis}} is usually accompanied by synthesis of ribonucleic acid (RNA); {{but in the}} presence of the antibiotics chloramphenicol (Gale, 1953) and puromycin (Yarmolinski & de la Haba, 1959; Takeda, Hayashi, Nakagawa & Suzuki, 1960), or the purine analogues 8 -azaguanine (Chantrenne & Devreux, 1960; Roodyn & Mandel, 1960) and 8 -azaadenine, {{protein synthesis}} can be sup-pressed while RNA continues to be made. Such RNA has often been thought to be abnormal and the cessation of protein synthesis attributed to the fact that it could not function in metabolism.

But in the case of chloramphenicol the evidence that the accumulating RNA is abnormal is entirely indirect: thus, this material is un-stable while most bacterial RNA is not (Horowitz, Lombard & Chargaff, 1958); it is broken down by the cells when they are freed from antibiotic and a t the same time material absorbing at 260 mp appears in the medium, re-entering the cells when growth resumes (Hahn, Schaechter, Ceglowski, Hopps & Ciak, 1957); and in ultracentrifuge diagrams for cell-free bacterial extracts it appears as large peaks due to ribonucleoprotein (RNP) sedimenting at 14 - 18 S, whereas in extracts of untreated cells only small peaks are seen in this region of the pattern (Nomura & Watson, 1959; Dagley & Sykes, 1959).

A monoclonal anti-CEA hybridoma (11 - 285 - 14) was made sensitive to hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine (HAT), by back selecting it in increasing concentrations of 8 - <b>azaguanine.</b> Eight 8 -azaguanine resistant fusion partners were selected based on growth characteristics and continued anti- CEA production. As doxorubicin (Dox) is a hapten, it was conjugated to carrier proteins keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) using l-ethyl- 3 - (dimethyl-aminopropyl) carbodiimide. Dox-KLH arid Dox-BSA conjugates were employed to immunize mice and spleen cells were used for fusions with the HAT sensitive anti-CEA 11 - 285 - 14 using standard hybridoma procedures.

40|$|Thiouracil exerts an {{inhibitory}} {{influence on}} induced lysogenic Bacterium megaterium {{that is much}} more extensive on phage protein and phage DNA synthesis than on bacterial protein and DNA synthesis. The number of infectious phage particles produced decreases more than does the amount of phage protein. The action of thiouracil is reversible by uracil, but not by thymine nor thymidine. Ultraviolet irradiation suppresses the inhibitory effect of thiouracil unless the cells have {{been in contact with}} the latter for 30 - 60 min preceding irradiation. Thiouracil incorporation into RNA is also suppressed by ultraviolet irradiation. Nevertheless, a considerable amount is incorporated if the thiouracil is added 30 min before irradiation. The parallelism which seems to exist between incorporation of thiouracil into RNA and its inhibitory action on phage protein synthesis is consistent with the hypothesis that a particular fraction of RNA participates in the synthesis of phage constituents and that thiouracil influences phage synthesis by being incorporated into this fraction. Though the phenomenon is not so readily observed, <b>azaguanine</b> also seems to exert a selective inhibitory action on the synthesis of phage protein and phage DNA in induced lysogenic Bacterium megaterium.

In the present study, an 8 '-azaguanine resistant cell line, termed HL- 60 R, was established by drug selection of the promyelocytic cell line HL- 60. This novel cell line showed resistance to high concentrations of 8 '- <b>azaguanine</b> and was sensitive to aminopterin.

Fluorescence labelling of ex vivo isolated macrophages prior to fusion and subsequent FACS analysis showed that PEG- 4000 is a more effective fusion agent than PEG- 1500. The generation of this novel fusion partner cell line opens the possibility for development of human macrophage hybridoma or other cell lines from myelocytic origin.

Somatic cell hybrids between PCC 4 aza 1 and spleen cells morphologically resemble teratocarcinoma stem cells and do not express H- 2 antigens. However, after differentiation in vitro, one of these hybrid clones expresses the H- 2 K and - 2 D gene products of both parental cell lines, one close expresses H- 2 -D- but not H- 2 K-coded antigenic determinants, and one clone remains H- 2 negative.

Effect of 8 -azaguanine on the {{transition}} from vegetative growth to presporulation in Bacillus cereus. J. Bacteriol. 91 : 1875 – 1882. 1966. —The guanine analogue, 8 -azaguanine (azaG), was found to inhibit sporulation of Bacillus cereus strain T when added to proliferating cells, but not to inhibit when added after {{the transition}} to presporulation. When azaG was added to vegetative cells, the growth rate was reduced, but no immediate bactericidal effect was demonstrated. <b>Azaguanine</b> was shown to be incorporated solely into ribonucleic acid (RNA). All of the natural purine bases and nucleosides were found to prevent azaG inhibition by blocking incorporation of the analogue into the RNA. Addition of a subinhibitory level of C 14 -azaG to proliferating cells resulted {{in an increase in}} incorporation paralleling the increase in number of cells. At the time of transition from growth to presporulation, a rapid removal of the azaG label from the cells occurred in the absence of net RNA breakdown. If differentiation was inhibited by increasing the concentration of azaG, then no expulsion took place. Instead, at the end of growth, net incorporation ceased, and a steady-state condition was established in which incorporation equaled breakdown. No azaG degradative enzymes are present in presporulating cells. The possibility is discussed that an increase in the ratio of natural purines to azaG occurred at the time of transition, and that the natural purine derivatives then were reincorporated into RNA preferentially to azaG. The data are consistent with the hypothesis than an increased rate of RNA turnover occurs at the time of transition from vegetative growth to presporulation. Addition of phosphate buffer (pH 7. 0, 0. 1 m) to azaG-inhibited vegetative cells caused reversal of inhibition, the reversal being accompanied by expulsion of the azaG. At least a partial explanation of this effect is that phosphate causes a decrease in the azaG intracellular pool size...|$|E
