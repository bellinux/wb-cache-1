25|$|In a {{case study}} by Gondim et al. 2010, a seventy–seven-year-old woman with Parkinson's disease (PD) was {{administered}} amantadine {{after a year of}} various other <b>antiparkinsonian</b> treatments. Two days into her treatment, she started to experience musical hallucinations, which consisted of four musical pieces. The music persisted until three days after cessation of the drug. Although the patient was taking other medications at the same time, the timing of onset and offset suggested that amantadine either had a synergistic effect with the other drugs or simply caused the hallucinations. Although the case wasn't specific to intoxication, it leads to the idea that persons with PD who are treated with certain drugs can experience musical hallucinations.|$|E

40|$|Background: In Slovenia, {{there has}} been no {{evidence}} about the prescribing patterns for inpatients with psychotic disorders. The research aims to analyze drug utilization patterns for inpatients with psychotic disorder that are coded as F 20 -F 29 according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 th revision (schizophrenia spectrum disorders). Subjects and methods: Prospective research was conducted at the Psychiatric Hospital Idrija. The medical records of the inpatients admitted over a 12 -month period were collected from the beginning to the end of their hospitalization. Results: A total of 311 inpatients with 446 hospitalizations were included, producing a total of 3954 medication prescriptions. Medications prescribed pro re nata (the use of as needed) were also taken into account. Antipsychotics (N= 1149, 43 % of prescriptions) were the most often prescribed medications, followed by anxiolytics, <b>antiparkinsonians,</b> antidepressants, mood stabilizers and cardiovascular drugs. A total of 256 (82 %) inpatients received at least one pro re nata medication. It was observed that the studied population was treated with one antipsychotic on 27 percent of prescriptions. Conclusions: Inpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders were exposed to a large number of different drugs. They were not received only psychotropic drugs but also other medications. With the knowledge about medications the implementation of clinical pharmacy services to the psychiatrists would significantly improve medication of inpatients with psychotic disorders and polypharmacotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dopamine {{agonists}} such as bromocriptine or pergolide {{are often}} used in Japan to treat Parkinson's disease. Dopamine agonists are relatively expensive drugs; economic evaluations are required. Objective: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of dopamine agonists {{for the treatment of}} Parkinson's disease in Japan. Design and setting: We used a Markov model to simulate the course of Parkinson's disease and to compare the cost effectiveness of dopamine agonists added to levodopa with that of levodopa alone in Japan. The model assumed that 60 -year-old men with Parkinson's disease in Hoehn-Yahr (HY) stages 2 to 5 using levodopa were administered dopamine agonists or continued on levodopa alone. The incremental cost effectiveness of dopamine agonists used for 10 years was then estimated. Study perspective: Societal. Main outcome measures and results: In the patients in HY stage 2, the incremental cost effectiveness of dopamine agonists was 18 610 000 to 19 320 000 yen (Yen) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) [$US 172 300 to $US 178 900 /QALY; 1998 values]. In patients in HY stage 3 or higher, the use of dopamine agonists was dominant over levodopa alone mainly due to reduced cost for care. In sensitivity analyses, costs and effectiveness of dopamine agonists significantly influenced the results. The use of a generic formulation of bromocriptine was dominant over levodopa alone even in the patients with HY stage 2 disease. Conclusions: Dopamine agonists appear to be cost effective in advanced Parkinson's disease, although their use is sensitive to the costs and effectiveness of dopamine agonists. If factors discouraging the prescription of generic drugs in Japan were removed, the treatment of Parkinson's disease would become more cost effective. <b>Antiparkinsonians,</b> Bromocriptine, Cost utility, Dopamine receptor agonists, Levodopa, Parkinson's disease, Pergolide, Pharmacoeconomics...|$|R

2500|$|Treatment of the {{movement}} and cognitive portions of the disease may worsen hallucinations and psychosis, while treatment of hallucinations and psychosis with antipsychotics may worsen parkinsonian or ADHD symptoms in DLB, such as tremor or rigidity and lack of concentration or impulse control. Physicians may find the use of cholinesterase inhibitors represents the treatment of choice for cognitive problems and donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), and galantamine (Reminyl) may be recommended {{as a means to}} help with these problems and to slow or prevent the decline of cognitive function. [...] DLB may be more responsive to donepezil than Alzheimer's disease. Memantine also may be useful. Levocarb may help with movement problems, but in some cases, as with dopamine agonists, may tend to aggravate psychosis in people with DLB. Clonazepam may help with rapid eye movement behavior disorder; table salt or antihypotensive medications may help with fainting and other problems associated with orthostatic hypotension. Botulinum toxin injections in the parotid glands may help with sialorrhea. Other medications, especially stimulants such as the ADHD drug methylphenidate (Ritalin) and modafinil, may improve daytime alertness, but as with the <b>antiparkinsonian</b> drug Levocarb, antihyperkinetics such as Ritalin increase the risk of psychosis. Experts advise extreme caution in the use of antipsychotic medication in people with DLB because of their sensitivity to these agents. When these medications must be used, atypical antipsychotics are preferred to typical antipsychotics; a very low dose should be tried initially and increased slowly, and patients should be carefully monitored for adverse reactions to the medications.|$|E

40|$|Background: Not all {{patients}} with Parkinson's disease (PD) respond to levodopa and others develop dyskinesias. Ropinirole, a dopamine agonist, {{is associated with}} fewer dyskinesias than levodopa. Objective: To examine {{the economic impact of}} reducing dyskinesias using ropinirole instead of levodopa plus benserazide in PD was examined. The research question addressed was: is the added cost of ropinirole offset by savings due to avoided cases of dyskinesia? Methods: A cost-minimisation analysis was performed from both the societal and Ministry of Health (MoH) of Ontario, Canada perspectives, using 5 -year data from a study of dyskinesia outcomes comparing ropinirole with levodopa plus benserazide. A predictive model was developed to capture resource utilisation over 5 years, such as medication costs, medical consultations, hospital admissions, nursing home admissions, caregiver time and productivity loss. The model was based on a previously reported clinical trial which determined dyskinesia rates to be 20 % for ropinirole and 45 % for levodopa. Standard costing lists were used, and costs were discounted at various rates. Constant 1999 Canadian dollars ($Can) were applied, and no increases were assumed over the time horizon of the analysis. A multivariate sensitivity analysis with changes in key parameters was also performed. Results: From a societal perspective, ropinirole was cost saving. From the MoH perspective, the analysis yielded an incremental expected daily cost/patient of $Can 4. 41 for substituting levodopa plus benserazide with ropinirole. Ropinirole resulted in daily savings/patient of $Can 0. 17 in non-drug healthcare costs. In the sensitivity analysis, the direction of results did not change despite changes of 15 to 20 % in key parameters, suggesting robustness of the model. Conclusions: From the societal perspective, in comparison with levodopa plus benserazide, the added cost of ropinirole is offset by savings due to avoided cases of dyskinesia. <b>Antiparkinsonians,</b> Cost minimisation, Levodopa/benserazide, Parkinson's disease, Pharmacoeconomics, Ropinirole...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Pramipexole was {{recently}} approved in the US {{for treatment of}} the symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Although pramipexole {{has been found to}} be safe and efficacious when compared with placebo, little data are yet available on its cost effectiveness when compared with baseline treatment. The aim of this study was to estimate the costs and cost effectiveness (cost utility) of pramipexole compared with baseline treatment in patients with early and advanced PD. Design and Setting: We developed a cost-effectiveness (CE) model in the US setting that linked Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Parts II (activities of daily life) and III (motor) scores to disease progression, costs and patient utility. Data for the model were obtained from clinical trials, a literature review and a survey of 193 patients' health resource use and utility. We used cost and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) estimates from the model to estimate the incremental cost effectiveness of pramipexole relative to baseline treatment patterns. We performed separate analyses for patients with early and advanced PD. We also performed extensive sensitivity analyses by adding other dopamine agonists to the no-pramipexole treatment regimen and varying disease progression parameters. The study was conducted from the societal perspective, although data presentation allows interpretation of cost effectiveness from either the societal or payer perspective. Main Outcome Measures and Results: For patients with both early and advanced PD, treatment with pramipexole had higher costs but was more effective than baseline treatment. For patients with early onset of PD, the incremental total CE ratio for pramipexole was $US 8837 /QALY. For patients with advanced PD, the incremental CE ratio was $US 12 294 /QALY (1997 costs). These ratios were lower than the CE ratios of many widely used medical treatments. Conclusions: Subject to the inherent limitations of modelling chronic disease progression and subsequent healthcare costs and patient utility, the results suggested that pramipexole was a cost effective treatment for patients with early and advanced PD in the US.

40|$|The {{progressive}} disability of Parkinson's disease {{results in}} substantial burdens for patients, {{their families and}} society in terms of increased health resource use, poorer quality of life, caregiver burden, disrupted family relationships, decreases in social and leisure activities, deteriorating emotional well-being, and direct and indirect costs of illness. Health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) measures have been used successfully in cross-sectional studies to identify and characterise these burdens; however, there is not yet substantial evidence that these instruments will be responsive to changes in patients over time and that the results will provide patients and health professionals with clinically meaningful information useful in making decisions about treatment strategies. The few studies documenting direct and indirect costs indicate increased use of ancillary health and community services, significant adaptations in home and transportation, increased use of mobility and self-care aids, and {{lack of access to}} appropriate healthcare providers. Patients with Parkinson's disease incur higher hospital expenses, have increased number of prescriptions, and experience earnings loss; the latter also applies to family caregivers. The choice, intensity and timing of therapy are determined by a variety of factors: presenting symptoms, age, employment status, comorbidity, cognitive impairment and level of functional impairment. Choices must be individually tailored to a patient's physical and personal needs. To be useful for patients with Parkinson's disease in clinical practice, clinicians should be able to use HR-QOL measures to identify appropriate medical interventions or socio-behavioural modifications to modify the HR-QOL deficits. However, while the interplay of interventions and clinical outcomes are often well understood, the effects of interventions on HR-QOL outcomes have not been studied extensively. Little research has been done that explicitly links the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease to the HR-QOL outcomes. The only Parkinson's disease cost-effectiveness study as yet performed indicated higher costs for patients receiving pramipexole than for those not taking the drug, but additional quality life-years were gained. Longer term effectiveness of many treatment strategies, and the usefulness of HR-QOL instruments to assess these treatments for individual patients over time, are critical areas for future research.

40|$|Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is {{a common}} chronic {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder associated with the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The natural course of the disease may lead to severe disability despite a variety of pharmacological and surgical treatment options. Levodopa {{is still the most}} effective symptomatic treatment for PD; however, long term use can cause a number of adverse effects including motor complications, nausea and vomiting, postural hypotension and changes in mental status. The onset of motor complications marks a crucial point in the management of PD. They may present as changes between akinetic and mobile phases (motor fluctuations) or as abnormal involuntary movements (dyskinesias). After levodopa treatment for 3 to 5 years, motor complications occur in approximately 50 % of patients, and after 10 years in > 80 % of patients. Treatment options have recently expanded as new drugs have been licensed and surgical procedures refined. Patients with motor complications present a demanding task in disease management, and often multiple drugs and high dosages are necessary to achieve only suboptimal control, resulting in increased healthcare utilisation. Costs increase considerably in patients with motor fluctuations and dyskinesias compared with patients without these symptoms. In a French study, 6 -month direct medical costs per patient increased from 1648 euros (EUR) to EUR 3028 in patients without and with motor fluctuations, respectively. In a recent French study a significant difference in monthly direct medical costs was found in patients with and without dyskinesias (EUR 560 vs 170). Unfortunately, no data are available on the effect of motor complications on indirect costs. Several studies have shown that health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) is reduced when motor fluctuations occur. This may also be true of dyskinesias, but because of the limited number of studies a definite conclusion is not yet possible. Recently, surgical treatment options have been used to deal with advanced PD and late stage complications. Although their effect on motor complications and HR-QOL is well documented, they result in increased costs (total medical cost: EUR 28920) compared with drug treatment alone and are increasingly restricted by healthcare providers. The {{purpose of this article is}} to review the available data from pharmacotherapeutic, surgical and economic studies on HR-QOL and healthcare expenditure in patients with PD, with a major focus on the impact of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. <b>Antiparkinsonians,</b> Cost analysis, Parkinson's disease, Pharmacoeconomics, Quality of life, Resource use...|$|R
