5|$|By mid-morning, Ney {{had moved}} toward the front with Gazan's brigade {{and he could see}} the enemy {{advancing}} toward him; still expecting Soult's reinforcements on his flanks, he anticipated an easy victory, like the one three days earlier in which Masséna's force had pounded Hotze's column at Frauenfeld. He did not realise, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet,</b> that Hotze had 8,000men with which to secure the crossroads north of Winterthur. Ney brought more of his men to the front, and moved against the Austrian left. In an Austrian volley, he and his horse went down; the horse was killed and Ney received a knee injury. He had his wound bandaged, called for another horse, and reentered the fight.|$|E
25|$|A similar defense {{comes from}} Australian philosopher Frank Jackson (born 1943) who revived {{the theory of}} epiphenomenalism which argues that mental states do not {{play a role in}} {{physical}} states. Jackson argues that {{there are two kinds of}} dualism. The first is substance dualism that assumes there is second, non-corporeal form of reality. In this form, body and soul are two different substances. The second form is property dualism that says that body and soul are different properties of the same body. He claims that functions of the mind/soul are internal, very private experiences that are not accessible to observation by others, and therefore not accessible by science (<b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet).</b> We can know everything, for example, about a bat's facility for echolocation, but we will never know how the bat experiences that phenomenon.|$|E

Johnson later wrote on his Twitter that the information about him writing a treatment for Episode IX is old, and he's not involved with the writing of that film. When asked about Episode VIII in an August 2014 interview, Johnson said [...] "it's boring to talk about, because the only thing I can really say is, I'm just happy.

40|$|Looming crisis, public {{discontent with}} privatization, and {{widening}} inequalities are factors which have historically set the electorate {{in favour of}} social democratic welfare policies. Today,however, these concerns rather appear to support new right-wing populist countermovements, even in the traditionally progressive Nordic countries.

6000|$|Part of this superiority {{these men}} owed to their age; in which heroism and devotedness were still practised, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> disbelieved in; {{but much of}} it {{likewise}} they owed to themselves.

A noble instinct sometimes raises him above this; but an instinct only, and acting only for moments. He has no Religion; in the shallow age, where his days were cast, Religion was not discriminated from the New and Old Light forms of Religion; and was, with these, becoming obsolete in the minds of men. His heart, indeed, is alive with a trembling adoration, but there is no temple in his understanding. He lives in darkness and in the shadow of doubt.

That seemed the most plausible theory, yet he could not content himself with it. A theory that pleased him better was, that this cablegram would be followed by another, of a gentler sort, requiring him to come home.

She wanted to marry so that her plans might be settled before her father and his new wife arrive; and now she considers that they are settled. So be careful. It is true that the objections she formerly had to you are removed, but before you ask her to marry you, you should seriously ask yourself what reason there is she should do so. She does not know you very well; she is not interested in you; and I am very sure she is not in love with you. Now you know, for I have told you so, that I would be delighted to see you two married. I believe you would suit each other admirably, but although you may agree with me in this opinion, I am quite sure she does not; <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet.</b> Now, this is all I am going to say, except that you have my very best wishes that you may get her." ...|$|E

The leaves still lingered brown and red upon the trees. He carried her cloak and opened gates for her and held back brambles while she passed. She had always been {{indifferent}} to these small gallantries; but to-day she welcomed them. She wished to feel her power to attract and command. They avoided all subjects on which they could differ, even in words. They talked of people and places they had known together. They remembered their common love of animals and told of the comedies and tragedies that had befallen their pets. Joan's regret was that she had not now even a dog, thinking it cruel to keep them in London. She hated the women she met, dragging the poor little depressed beasts about {{at the end of a}} string: savage with them, if they dared to stop for a moment to exchange a passing wag of the tail with some other little lonely sufferer. It was as bad as keeping a lark in a cage. She had tried a cat: but so often she did not get home till late and that was just the time when the cat wanted to be out; so that they seldom met. He suggested a parrot. His experience of them was that they had no regular hours and would willingly sit up all night, if encouraged, and talk all the time. Joan's objection to running a parrot was that it stamped you as an old maid; and she wasn't that, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet.</b> She wondered if she could make an owl really happy.

40|$|This article {{identifies}} significant recent {{public order}} policing strategy {{change on the}} part of the public police—first, in recognition of the dynamic relationship between disorder and policing, and second, concerning a more flexible conceptualization of the traditional “riot curve”. This would potentially move the policing of social disorder away from a situation of what Wright refers to in Policing: An Introduction to Concepts and Practice (2002) as “simply coping” with conflict towards one of “managing” it, being part of the process of transition for policing generally from modern to late‐modern. For a fundamental shift to occur in the public order policing arena though, such policies would need to be carried through in practice.

40|$|There are two interrelated {{questions}} that I {{would like to}} explore {{in the context of}} Pleshette DeArmitt’s work. The first one pertains to the intellectual stakes in the eloquent style of her writing, its elegance and playfulness, which accompanies the philosophical order of argumentation. And the second one refers to the issue of female friendship. How can one discuss such friendship without resorting to merely biographical, historical, or autobiographical terms? Yet what kind of philosophical theories of female friendship could I possibly refer to? Perhaps to none. DeArmitt, whose life has created so many friendships, did not live long enough to write about friendship, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> directly. And <b>yet</b> I would like to suggest that her captivating—the adjective that I use here deliberately—book, The Right to Narcissism: A Case for Im-possible Self-Love, leaves us traces of female friendship in her philosophical argument that narcissistic self-love is inseparable from the love of another.     </div...|$|R
