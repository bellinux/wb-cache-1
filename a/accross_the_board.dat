40|$|Vehicle drivetrains {{are complex}} {{integrated}} systems, which {{need to be}} designed for numerous thermodynamic, economic and environmental factors. As part of a project of the Alliance for Global Sustainability between the MIT, the SFITs and the University of Tokyo, a new evolutionary multi-objective optimisation algorithm has been developed and applied to various problems including vehicle drivetrain configurations. The simulation of a potential vehicle is complex and calculation intensive. The new algorithm, the Clustering Pareto Evolustionary Algorithm (CPEA) is attractive {{in this kind of}} problems because it allows an efficient use of each vehicle simulation - gathering more information about the solution domain for the same effort as a single point optimisation. In addition it allows optimisation of disparate objectives, for example, costs and emissions to be considered separately. Conventional, series electric hybrid and parallel electric hybrid have been evaluated over the ECE-EUDC and US 06 HWY drive cycles considering performance in terms of CO 2, NOx, fuel economy, estimated investment, operating and pollution costs. Although some own technology models have been developed and used, the major part of the optimisation results are based on models from Advisor which are available on the web. The parallel hybrids were shown to be preferable to series hybrids in all cases studied, but were frequently beaten by conventional vehicles. In this first study, pollution costs considerations were limited to NOx (13. 8 Frs/kg) and CO 2, (0. 03 Frs/kg) and diesel engine vehicles proved difficult to beat in terms of operating costs, and even overall investment and operating cost. Indeed it was found that a five fold increase in pollution costs traditionaly considered in the literature, would be needed before any difference would be observed. Of course the situation looks different if investment and operating cost, without any pollution costs, are evaluated only in comparison with the NOx emission levels or if a pollution cost of particulates is added. Among marketed hybrids the “Insight” was found to be highly attractive (keeping however in mind its limited seating capacity), although its exceptional performance is undoubtedly linked to the ultra light weight structure, which, in spite of the braking energy recovery of hybrids, is still shown to have a major effect. It {{is interesting to note that}} the pollution costs were found to be of low significance compared to the operating and investment costs and an average vehicle, mainly due to the significant level of tax already applied to fuel in the road transport domain. Politically it would seem that applying a uniform CO 2 cost <b>accross</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> of all energy domains will have a much more limited effect on the road vehicle technologis, than an other technologies such as those used for building heating and air conditioning...|$|E

40|$|The {{bacterial}} protein toxins {{endowed with}} the ability to translocate <b>accross</b> <b>the</b> plasmatic membrane are often crucial virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria invading eucaryotic organisms. These toxins translocate either their own protein domains carrying toxic activity or can form pores transfering other substances like small ions, DNA, RNA or proteins. By observing the translocation of these molecules together with others artificially prepared agens on synthetic membranes allows detailed understanding of mode of action of individual pore- forming toxins. Some of the toxins were actually described in such a detail, that can serve as investigation tools for characterization of new translocated molecules. One of such example is the transfer of nucleotides or whole nucleic acid molecules <b>accross</b> <b>the</b> membrane pore of α- hemolysine of S. aureus.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to achieve {{sustainable}} Natural Resource Management (NRM), the Commonwealth and State governments have moved to a regional focus for their major funding programs. This approach was driven by the belief that previous arrangements {{had been unable to}} achieve the required amount of change at the appropriate landscape scale and that state and national priorities were not being addressed. The authors, with a background in regional and national NRM and Landcare <b>accross</b> <b>the</b> three Eastern states, have used their experience and knowledge of recent literature in this area, to evaluate the regional approach to NRM. As part of our evaluation we review theassumptions behind the move to the regional model and explore its strengths and weakness. Some of the key strengths of the approach are that it facilitates landscape-scale management, enhances integration accross agencies and governments, and builds partnerships and enhances the capacity of participants. A key weakness is that there continues to be a focus on outputs rather than outcomes and this hinders our learning about how to improve NRM. Other weaknesses are poorly developed methologies to underpin integration at the regional sacle, the high transaction costs involved in operating <b>accross</b> <b>the</b> federal structure, insufficient autonomy for regional groups, and a lack of forward funding commitments...|$|R
