5|$|Several {{subspecies}} of the goldcrest {{have been}} described. In continental Eurasia, {{there are nine}} generally accepted and very similar subspecies, differing only in details such as plumage shade. At the genetic level, the two Central Asian forms, R. r. sikkimensis and R. r. himalayensis, <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> each other, and have differentiated only in the recent past, but they diverged from the western subspecies around 2.8mya.|$|E
5|$|As {{it passed}} {{perihelion}} on April 1, 1997 the comet {{developed into a}} spectacular sight. It shone brighter than any star in the sky except Sirius, and its dust tail stretched 40–45 degrees across the sky. The comet was visible well before the sky got fully dark each night, and while many great comets <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the Sun as they pass perihelion, comet Hale–Bopp was visible all night to northern hemisphere observers.|$|E
5|$|House {{prices in}} Arbroath <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the {{national}} average and in April–June 2006 were £99 below {{the national average}}, local prices averaging £113,646 compared to {{the national average of}} £113,745. The average house price across Angus has risen by 14.9% in the past year (to November 2006) and now stands at £124,451. Angus Council suggests the recent upgrading of the A92 between Arbroath and Dundee to dual carriageway has lured Dundonians to Arbroath and this may be driving up house prices.|$|E

5|$|Use of an {{automated}} external defibrillator on a patient in a metal underwire bra can cause burns, and the bra should be removed by the first responder before the AED is applied. In their 2007 season, the television program MythBusters tested the possibility of burns resulting from using a defibrillator on a patient who is using an underwire bra, and concluded that while it is possible, {{it is not likely}} unless the metal underwire is exposed and paddles of the defibrillator <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|E

5|$|VV Corvi {{is a close}} spectroscopic binary, its two {{component}} stars orbiting {{each other}} with a period of 1.46 days. Both are yellow-white main-sequence stars of spectral type F5V, though the primary has begun expanding and cooling as it nears the end of its time on the main sequence. The mass ratio of the two stars is 0.775 ± 0.024. A tertiary companion was discovered during the Two Micron All-Sky Survey. W Corvi is an eclipsing binary that varies in brightness from apparent magnitude 11.16 to 12.5 over 9 hours. Its period has increased by 1/4 second over a century. It is an unusual system in that its two stars <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> each other yet have different surface temperatures, and hence thermal transfer is not taking place as expected. SX Corvi is an eclipsing binary that is also a contact binary known as a W Ursae Majoris variable. The two component stars orbit closely enough to each other for mass to have been transferred between them—in this case the secondary having transferred a large amount of mass to the primary. RV Corvi is another eclipsing binary. Its brightness varies from apparent magnitude 8.6 to 9.16 over 18 hours. The system is composed of stars of spectral types F0 and G0, which orbit each other every 0.7473 days.|$|E

25|$|It {{was long}} thought that q was positive, {{indicating}} that the expansion is slowing down due to gravitational attraction. This would imply an age of the Universe less than 1/H (which is about 14 billion years). For instance, a value for q of 1/2 (once favoured by most theorists) would give {{the age of the}} Universe as 2/(3H). The discovery in 1998 that q is apparently negative means that the Universe could actually be older than 1/H.

25|$|Based on {{different}} {{estimates for the}} length of periods for which still very few historical documents are available, so-called Long, Middle, Short and Ultra-short Chronologies have been proposed by various scholars, varying by as much as 150 years in their dating of specific periods. Despite problems with the Middle Chronology, this chronological framework continues to be used by many recent handbooks on the archaeology and history of the ancient Near East. A study from 2001 published high-resolution radiocarbon dates from Turkey supporting dates for the 2nd millennium BC that <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> those proposed by the Middle Chronology.|$|E
25|$|The sky {{is usually}} clear above {{the desert and}} the {{sunshine}} duration is extremely high everywhere in the Sahara.
