Five identical boys approach and watch as the lineman adversely reacts to the sting, causing him to {{fall to the ground}} and die. The boys look down at his body, then walk off silently.|$|E
5|$|Bus. M-28 started <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small hill at an {{intersection}} with M-28 southwest of Newberry. The highway ran due north from the intersection along Engadine Road, running downhill towards Teaspoon Creek. Just {{south of the}} Tahquamenon River, Bus. M-28 turned east into the community of Dollarville. There the trunkline followed Dollarville Road and Engadine Road to the western city limits of Newberry.|$|E
5|$|Continuing eastward from Grantsville, Alt US40 intersects US 219 a short {{distance}} north of exit 22 on I-68, where US219 leaves the freeway. East of this intersection, traffic decreases, with an AADT of 1,681, the lowest traffic density along the entire route. The US219 intersection is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hill known as Chestnut Ridge.|$|E

5|$|One story relates that Gytha, Harold's mother, {{offered the}} victorious duke {{the weight of}} her son's body in gold for its custody, but was refused. William ordered that Harold's body be thrown into the sea, but whether that took place is unclear. Another story relates that Harold was buried <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cliff. Waltham Abbey, which had been founded by Harold, later claimed that his body had been {{secretly}} buried there. Other legends claimed that Harold did not die at Hastings, but escaped and became a hermit at Chester.|$|E
5|$|Professor Nathan Katz {{writes of}} {{the analogy of}} a burning building, used by the Buddha in the Lotus Sutra, which casts {{religious}} language as imperative. In the analogy, a father sees his children <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> burning building. He persuades them to leave, but only by promising them toys if they leave. Katz argues that {{the message of the}} parable is not that the Buddha has been telling lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative use of language. Katz believes that religious language is an imperative and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} using a single, diagonally mounted four-way joystick. The player {{controls}} Q*bert, who starts each game <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pyramid made of 28 cubes, and moves by hopping diagonally from cube to cube. Landing on a cube causes it to change color, and changing every cube to the target color allows the player to progress to the next stage.|$|E

5|$|The site is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Carboniferous Limestone ridge on the {{northern}} edge of the Mendip Hills. It forms part of the Black Down Pericline where the limestone has been exposed because of erosion of the overlying Triassic Dolomitic Conglomerate. The soil depth varies considerably, owing to the slope within the site and the effects of its exposure to the wind.|$|E
5|$|The {{water tower}} from 1895 was {{designed}} by Christian Hjerrild Clausen who had been inspired by Nuremberg's medieval Nassauer Haus. Standing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cliff, it commands excellent views {{of the city and}} the harbour from its platform which is open to the public. The imposing old Courthouse Building on the central square with its tall tower and stepped gables has recently been fully renovated. A bronze equestrian statue of Christian IX, the founder of Esbjerg, stands at the centre of the square.|$|E
5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches {{to be opened}} and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% {{of the length of}} the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated {{around the edges of the}} hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E
50|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{mountain}} {{there is}} a large golden Buddha statue. This statue, other temple buildings, and much of Krabi town can be seen from shrine <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stairs.|$|R

5|$|Boeing {{initially}} {{proposed a}} purpose-built aircraft, but tests indicated {{it would not}} outperform the already-operational 707, so the latter was chosen instead. To increase endurance, this design was to be powered by eight General Electric TF34s. It would carry its radar in a rotating dome mounted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> forward-swept tail, above the fuselage. Boeing was selected ahead of McDonnell Douglas's DC-8-based proposal in July 1970. Initial orders were placed for two aircraft, designated EC-137D as test beds to evaluate the two competing radars. As the test-beds did not need the same 14-hour endurance demanded of the production aircraft, the EC-137s retained the Pratt & Whitney JT3D commercial engines, and a later reduction in endurance requirement led to retaining the normal engines in production.|$|E
5|$|Peregrine falcon {{recovery}} teams breed {{the species}} in captivity. The chicks are usually fed through a chute {{or with a}} hand puppet mimicking a peregrine's head, so they cannot see to imprint on the human trainers. Then, when they are old enough, the rearing box is opened, allowing the bird to train its wings. As the fledgling gets stronger, feeding is reduced, forcing the bird to learn to hunt. This procedure is called hacking back to the wild. To release a captive-bred falcon, the bird is placed in a special cage <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tower or cliff ledge for some days or so, allowing it to acclimate itself to its future environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the battle, Harold's body was identified, either by his armour or marks on his body. The bodies of the English dead, who {{included}} some of Harold's brothers and his housecarls, were left on the battlefield, although some were removed by relatives later. Gytha, Harold's mother, offered the victorious duke {{the weight of her}} son's body in gold for its custody, but her offer was refused. William ordered that Harold's body be thrown into the sea, but whether that took place is unclear. Another story relates that Harold was buried <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cliff.

50|$|Tunjungan Plaza (recognize as TP for its short) is the second-biggest {{shopping}} center in Surabaya after Pakuwon Mall. It has {{an area of}} 165,000 m2, which houses more than 500 retail outlets including boutiques, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, bookstores, supermarkets and children's arcade center.

5|$|There is {{evidence}} of occupation of the area by people from Mesolithic times onward. In the Neolithic period, people started to manage animals and grow crops on farms cleared from the woodland, rather than act purely as hunters and as gatherers. It is also likely that extraction and smelting of mineral ores to make metal tools, weapons, containers and ornaments started in the late Neolithic, and continued into the bronze and Iron Ages. An earthen ring at Parracombe {{is believed to be}} a Neolithic henge dating from 5000–4000BC, and Cow Castle, which is where White Water meets the River Barle, is an Iron Age fort <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conical hill.|$|E
5|$|Three legends are narrated to the {{establishment}} of the monastery. In the first legend it is said that location of the present Monastery was selected by a horse which belonged to Merag Lama Lodre Gyatso who was on a mission assigned to him by the 5th Dalai Lama to establish a Monastery. After an intense search, when he failed to locate a suitable place, he retired into a cave to offer prayers seeking divine intervention to choose the site. When {{he came out of the}} cave, he found his horse missing. He then went in search of the horse and finally found it grazing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mountain called Tana Mandekhang, which in the past was the palace of King Kala Wangpo. He took this as a divine and auspicious guidance and decided to establish the monastery at that location. Seeking the help of the local people, Mera Lama established the monastery at that location in the latter part of 1681.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral is {{the seat}} of the Church of England Diocese of Bath and Wells. Wells has been an ecclesiastical city of {{importance}} since at least the early 8th century. Parts of the building date back to the tenth century, and it is a grade I listed building. It is known for its fine fan vaulted ceilings, Lady Chapel and windows, and the scissor arches which support the central tower. The west front {{is said to be the}} finest collection of statuary in Europe, retaining almost 300 of its original medieval statues, carved from the cathedral's warm, yellow Doulting stone. The Chapter House, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flight of stone stairs, leading out from the north transept is an octagonal building with a fan-vaulted ceiling. It is here that the business of running the cathedral is still conducted by the members of the Chapter, the cathedral's ruling body. Wells Cathedral clock is famous for its 24-hour astronomical dial and set of jousting knights that perform every quarter-hour. The cathedral has the heaviest ring of ten bells in the world. The tenor bell weighs just over 56CWT (6,272lb, 2,844kg).|$|E

5|$|Nehru Centre was {{established}} in 1972 at Worli in Bombay. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) was set up on 26 January 1975 by the Government of Maharashtra as an apex body for planning and co-ordination of development activities in the Mumbai metropolitan region. Nehru Science Centre, India's largest interactive science centre, {{was established}} in 1972 at Worli in Bombay. In August 1979, a sister township of Navi Mumbai was founded by City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) across Thane and Raigad districts of Maharashtra to help the dispersal and control of Mumbai's population. The Great Bombay Textile Strike was called on 18 January 1982 by trade union leader Dutta Samant, where nearly 250,000 workers and more than 50 textile mills in Bombay went on strike. On 17 May 1984, riots broke out in Bombay, Thane, and Bhiwandi after a saffron flag was placed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mosque. 278 were killed and 1,118 were wounded. The Jawaharlal Nehru Port was commissioned on 26 May 1989 at Nhava Sheva {{with a view to}} de-congest Bombay Harbour and to serve as a hub port for the city. In December 1992 – January 93, over 1,000 people were killed and the city paralyzed by communal riots between the Hindus and the Muslims caused by the destruction of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya. A series of 13 co-ordinated bomb explosions took place in Bombay on 12 March 1993, which resulted in 257 deaths and 700 injuries. The attacks were believed to be orchestrated by mafia don Dawood Ibrahim in retaliation for the Babri Mosque demolition. In 1996, the newly elected Shiv Sena-led government renamed the city of Bombay to the native name Mumbai, after the Koli native Marathi people Goddess Mumbadevi. Soon colonial British names were shed to assert or reassert local names, such as Victoria Terminus being renamed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus on 4 March 1996, after the 17th century Marathi King Shivaji.|$|E
