40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a variety of High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) conceptual designs for two operationally useful missions (hurricane science and communications relay) and compare their performance and cost characteristics. Sixteen potential HALE UAV configurations were initially developed, including heavier-than-air (HTA) and lighter-than-air (LTA) concepts with both <b>consumable</b> <b>fuel</b> and solar regenerative (SR) propulsion systems. Through an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) down select process, the two leading <b>consumable</b> <b>fuel</b> configurations (one each from the HTA and LTA alternatives) and an HTA SR configuration were selected for further analysis. Cost effectiveness analysis of the <b>consumable</b> <b>fuel</b> configurations revealed that simply maximizing vehicle endurance can lead to a sub-optimum system solution. An LTA concept with a hybrid propulsion system (solar arrays and a hydrogen-air proton exchange membrane fuel cell) was found to have the best mission performance; however, an HTA diesel-fueled wing-body-tail configuration emerged as the preferred <b>consumable</b> <b>fuel</b> concept because of the large size and technical risk of the LTA concept. The baseline missions could not be performed by even the best HTA SR concept. Mission and S...|$|R

40|$|Proper {{product design}} plays in {{important}} role in the success within a marketplace. In order for a product to succeed within <b>a</b> competitive <b>consumable</b> commodity market, the product must focus on specific attributes. This paper examines three historical case studies - the video cassette, the DVD, and the high definition markets. Through these three examples, trends amongst product features, consumer knowledge, brand, and the quality of technology were explored. To further examine what influences consumers' decision within <b>a</b> <b>consumable</b> commodity market <b>a</b> survey was designed to evaluate consumer choice. The survey consisted of a fictitious product that shares many of the same traits as <b>a</b> <b>consumable</b> commodity device. Correlation amongst the data was examined to help discern what might drive such markets. While numerous factors were observed within this study, the most significant results were observed regarding consumer knowledge and technology's role. Consumers tended to pick the products which they felt were most useful. Such a choice often did not correspond to the technologically superior product. As such, within <b>a</b> competitive <b>consumable</b> commodity market, it is important to design a product to focus on features that the consumers believe to be the most valuable. by Alexander F.

40|$|Abstract. The Naval Battle Group Supply (NBGS) {{model is}} a dynamic and {{stochastic}} representation of the supply of U. S. Navy battle groups (BGs) worldwide by its combat logistics forces. The model measures the Navy‟s capability to provide logistics support for critical <b>consumables</b> (ship <b>fuel,</b> aviation fuel, dry goods, and ammunition). Execution of the model provides key system performance measures such as total distances traveled and various service levels, e. g. time combat forces operate below a critical supply level. Information from the model is used to more effectively design supply ships, in terms of sizing and capabilities, and to test and evaluate alternative operating policies. The model considers the supply and resupply of consumables as BGs and supply ships (SSs) carry out operations worldwide. Consumption by BGs, which depends on distances traveled and type of activity, is considered both within theaters of operation and in transit between theater and homeport. Once a BG indicates a need for <b>a</b> <b>consumable,</b> <b>an</b> SS is dispatched to rendezvous with the BG and transfers the material at a model-determined location. Force needs and demand for materials within theaters change based on stochastic actions, e. g. combat, show of force, humanitarian assistance. In order to meet changing force needs, BGs may be pulled from other theaters or from homeport. The model also considers the resupply of supply ships at friendly ports. All combat group and supply ship operational parameter values are populated in the model through a linked database. The NBGS model is developed in Flexsim, a discrete-event and continuous simulation model development and analysis environment. 1.
