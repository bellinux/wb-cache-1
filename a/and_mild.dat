5|$|Lead is a {{very soft}} metal with a Mohs {{hardness}} of 1.5; it can be scratched with a fingernail. It is quite malleable and somewhat ductile. The bulk modulus of lead—a measure of its ease of compressibility—is 45.8GPa. In comparison, that of aluminium is 75.2GPa; copper 137.8GPa; <b>and</b> <b>mild</b> steel 160–169GPa. Lead's tensile strength, at 12–17 MPa, is low (that of aluminium is 6 times higher, copper 10 times, <b>and</b> <b>mild</b> steel 15 times higher); it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or antimony.|$|E

5|$|Benzoyl {{peroxide}} (BPO) is a first-line {{treatment for}} mild and moderate acne {{due to its}} effectiveness <b>and</b> <b>mild</b> side-effects (mainly skin irritation). In the skin follicle, benzoyl peroxide kills P. acnes by oxidizing its proteins through the formation of oxygen free radicals and benzoic acid. These free radicals are thought {{to interfere with the}} bacterium's metabolism and ability to make proteins. Additionally, benzoyl peroxide is mildly effective at breaking down comedones and inhibiting inflammation. Benzoyl peroxide may be paired with a topical antibiotic or retinoid such as benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide/adapalene, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The various nicknames {{associated}} with prepatellar bursitis {{arise from the}} fact that it commonly occurs among those individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling, such as carpenters, carpet layers, gardeners, housemaids, mechanics, miners, plumbers, and roofers. The exact incidence of the condition is not known; it is difficult to estimate because only severe septic cases require hospital admission, <b>and</b> <b>mild</b> non-septic cases generally go unreported. Prepatellar bursitis is more common among males than females. It affects all age groups, but is more likely to be septic when it occurs in children.|$|E
40|$|Van de Vliert's (2009) climato-economic {{theory of}} culture proposes {{that the impact}} of climatic demands on culture is {{influenced}} by wealth resources. In rich regions, much cold and heat in conjunction with relatively little wealth (undermatching) and little cold and heat in conjunction with relatively much wealth (overmatching) both are thought to produce less destructive leadership cultures than do approximations of just enough wealth to successfully cope with thermal climate (optimal matching). Avoiding confounding influences of numerous cross-national differences, we tested this tenet using employee survey data gathered in a sample of 191 Norwegian municipalities. Destructive leadership culture is less prevalent in less wealthy regions with more demanding winters and more demanding summers (undermatching) and in more wealthy regions with <b>milder</b> winters <b>and</b> <b>milder</b> summers (overmatching) than in more or less wealthy regions with either more demanding winters <b>and</b> <b>milder</b> summers or more demanding summers <b>and</b> <b>milder</b> winters (optimal matching). Disconfirmative tests could not obscure or destroy these findings...|$|R
