50|$|Alu {{repetitive}} element is member of Short Interspersed Elements (SINE) in mammalian genome. There are about 300 to 500 thousand copies of Alu {{repetitive element}} in human genome, which means one Alu element exists in 4 to 6 kb averagely. Alu elements are distributed widely in mammalian genome, and repeatability {{is one of}} the characteristics, that is why it is called Alu repetitive element.

40|$|The primate Alu {{interspersed}} repeats can be {{subdivided into}} classes {{on the basis}} of shared nucleotides at a set of diagnostic positions. Each of the classes of <b>Alu</b> <b>sequences</b> is apparently the result of past retrotransposition of transcripts of highly conserved class-specific source genes that differed from each other at the diagnostic positions. The nucleotides at the majority of positions are identical among the source genes and therefore were identical among all of the <b>Alu</b> <b>sequences</b> {{at the time of their}} insertion. These CONSBI (conserved before insertion) positions are useful because the changes that have occurred after insertion are recognizable and the divergence resulting from nucleotide substitutions, insertions, and deletions is informative. The divergence of <b>Alu</b> <b>sequences</b> at the CONSBI positions is a measure of the time since a class was inserted. The greatest majority of <b>Alu</b> <b>sequences</b> are in one class (identified as class II), and it is particularly suitable for such examination, since nearly full-length sequences are now known for nearly a thousand members of this class. The average divergence of class II members indicates that the class has an average age of about 40 million years. The distribution in divergence of class II accurately fits a sum of two Poisson distributions. The implication is that class II <b>Alu</b> <b>sequences</b> were derived from two massive past events of insertion of many <b>Alu</b> <b>sequences.</b> In this model the younger subset of class II sequences (corresponding to about 300, 000 copies in the genome) has an average divergence of 5 % at CONSBI positions. The older set of class II sequences (corresponding to about 150, 000 genomic copies) has a 9 % average divergence. Based on the drift rate of primate DNA sequences, the events of insertion probably occurred 30 - 50 million years ago. The goodness of the fit to the Poisson distribution indicates that no significant number of members of class II have been inserted since 30 million years ago...|$|R

40|$|Human glycophorin A, B, and E (GPA, GPB, and GPE) genes {{belong to}} a gene family located at the long arm of {{chromosome}} 4. These three genes are homologous from the 5 '-flanking sequence to the <b>Alu</b> <b>sequence,</b> which is 1 kb downstream from the exon encoding the transmembrane domain. Analysis of the <b>Alu</b> <b>sequence</b> and flanking direct repeat sequences suggested that the GPA gene most closely resembles the ancestral gene, whereas the GPB and GPE genes arose by homologous recombination within the <b>Alu</b> <b>sequence,</b> acquiring 3 ' sequences from an unrelated precursor genomic segment. Here we describe the identification of this putative precursor genomic segment. A human genomic library was screened by using the sequence of the 3 ' region of the GPB gene as a probe. The genomic clones isolated were found to contain an <b>Alu</b> <b>sequence</b> {{that appeared to be}} involved in the recombination. Downstream from the <b>Alu</b> <b>sequence,</b> the nucleotide sequence of the precursor genomic segment is almost identical to that of the GPB or GPE gene. In contrast, the upstream sequence of the genomic segment differs entirely from that of the GPA, GPB, and GPE genes. Conservation of the direct repeats flanking the <b>Alu</b> <b>sequence</b> of the genomic segment strongly suggests that the sequence of this genomic segment has been maintained during evolution. This identified genomic segment was found to reside downstream from the GPA gene by both gene mapping and in situ chromosomal localization. The precursor genomic segment was also identified in the orangutan genome, which is known to lack GPB and GPE genes. These results indicate that one of the duplicated ancestral glycophorin genes acquired a unique 3 ' sequence by unequal crossing-over through its <b>Alu</b> <b>sequence</b> and the further downstream <b>Alu</b> <b>sequence</b> present in the duplicated gene.

Numerous studies describe exonizations of Alu elements, that is, splicing-mediated insertions of parts of Alu sequences into mature mRNAs. To study {{the connection between the}} exonization of Alu elements and alternative splicing, we used a database of ESTs and cDNAs aligned to the human genome. We compiled two exon sets, one of 1176 alternatively spliced internal exons, and another of 4151 constitutively spliced internal exons. Sixty one alternatively spliced internal exons (5. 2 %) had a significant BLAST hit to an <b>Alu</b> <b>sequence,</b> but none of the constitutively spliced internal exons had such a hit.

Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a widespread modification of the transcriptome. The editing level in humans is significantly higher compared with nonprimates, due to exceptional editing within the primate-specific <b>Alu</b> <b>sequences,</b> but the global editing level of nonhuman primates has not been studied so far. Here we report the <b>sequencing</b> of transcribed <b>Alu</b> <b>sequences</b> in humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus monkeys.

40|$|Abstract Background Alu {{elements}} are Short INterspersed Elements (SINEs) in primate genomes that have proven useful as markers for studying genome evolution, population biology and phylogenetics. Most of these applications, however, {{have been limited}} to humans and their nearest relatives, chimpanzees. In an effort to expand our understanding of <b>Alu</b> <b>sequence</b> evolution and to increase the applicability of these markers to non-human primate biology, we have analyzed available Alu sequences for loci specific to platyrrhine (New World) primates. Results Branching patterns along an <b>Alu</b> <b>sequence</b> phylogeny indicate three major classes of platyrrhine-specific Alu sequences. Sequence comparisons further reveal at least three New World monkey-specific subfamilies; Alu Ta 7, Alu Ta 10, and Alu Ta 15. Two of these subfamilies appear {{to be derived from}} a gene conversion event that has produced a recently active fusion of Alu Sc- and Alu Sp-type elements. This is a novel mode of origin for new Alu subfamilies. Conclusion The use of Alu elements as genetic markers in studies of genome evolution, phylogenetics, and population biology has been very productive when applied to humans. The characterization of these three new Alu subfamilies not only increases our understanding of <b>Alu</b> <b>sequence</b> evolution in primates, but also opens the door to the application of these genetic markers outside the hominid lineage. </p...|$|E

40|$|Alu RNAs are {{transcribed}} {{from the}} repetitive Alu elements {{and can be}} found as free Alu RNAs or embedded in messenger RNAs (mRNAs), notably, in the untranslated regions (UTR), which are known to modulate the stability of mRNAs or their translation efficiency. A protein partner of Alu RNAs is the heterodimer SRP 9 / 14 of the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP). Therefore, SRP 9 / 14 could bind to embedded Alu RNAs and thus regulate mRNA expression. We developed a method to study this interaction, using two fusion proteins and in vivo crosslinking. We used as a positive control an isoform of TRF 2 mRNA (Telomeric Repeat Binding Factor 2), which binds SRP 9 / 14 in vitro via its <b>Alu</b> <b>sequence.</b> We were able to precipitate Alu-containing RNAs specifically with both proteins, when compared to mutant and negative control proteins.
