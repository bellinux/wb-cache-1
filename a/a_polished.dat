50|$|Both Stanisław and {{his wife}} Halina {{remained}} Polish patriots throughout their lives. They entertained at their home many Polish friends, among them Prof. Stanisław Swianiewicz and Prof. Lillian Falk (both also faculty members at SMU), General Stanisław Kopański, Professor General Marian Kukiel, and many other accomplished people of Polish origin. The Bóbr-Tylingos {{were responsible for the}} creation of the Polish Association of Halifax-Dartmouth (1982), <b>a</b> <b>Polish</b> Apostolate with <b>a</b> <b>Polish</b> priest, <b>a</b> <b>Polish</b> School, <b>Polish</b> scouts, <b>a</b> <b>Polish</b> publishing house, and <b>a</b> <b>Polish</b> library.

50|$|Maczków was {{the name}} of the central town of <b>a</b> <b>Polish</b> {{military}} enclave in Emsland, Germany, existing from 1945-1947, later renamed back to Haren. Maczków became <b>a</b> totally <b>Polish</b> town with <b>a</b> <b>Polish</b> mayor, <b>a</b> <b>Polish</b> school, <b>a</b> <b>Polish</b> fire brigade and <b>a</b> <b>Polish</b> rectory. The latter registered 289 weddings and 101 funerals. 479 Poles have birth certificates showing Maczków as place of birth. The town was returned to the original inhabitants when the Polish army unit returned to England in June 1947, and the Polish inhabitants of the town were either repatriated to Poland or moved to Great Britain.|$|R
5|$|Some locally-made items {{included}} prismatic obsidian blades and <b>a</b> <b>polished</b> nodule of iron pyrite {{for use as}} a mirror. Other {{items included}} weapons and instruments for navigation. A mariner's astrolabe is the oldest such instrument with a confirmed date. Pewter objects from England were found and stoneware from Cologne, Germany. In the end about 1,500 artifacts were retrieved from the San Esteban, 85% of them from the conglomerates.|$|E
5|$|Bronze mirrors {{arrived to}} Japan from China {{as early as}} the Yayoi period and {{continued}} to be imported through the Tang Dynasty (618–907). During that period mirrors cast in Japan were imitations of Chinese prototypes and subsequently Japanese designs were established. All of these mirrors were generally circular, with <b>a</b> <b>polished</b> front, and a back decorated with molded or engraved reliefs, sometimes inlaid with gold or silver. Three mirrors or sets of mirrors decorated with floral and animal motifs have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E
5|$|Dinefwr Park has {{a history}} of {{occupation}} spanning at least two millennia. <b>A</b> <b>polished</b> stone axe dated to the Neolithic period was unearthed on the site in 1976, and during the Iron Age, a farm existed on the property. The Romans later built a pair of forts here, with one partly overlying the other. There are traces of Roman roads and tracks, some of which may {{have been part of the}} Carmarthen–Llandovery Roman road. A Roman milestone and a coin hoard were unearthed near Dinefwr Castle, and pieces of amphorae and Samian items have been excavated near Dinefwr Farm.|$|E

5|$|For {{protection}} and preservation, <b>a</b> <b>polished</b> Japanese sword needs a scabbard. A fully mounted scabbard (koshirae) may {{consist of a}} lacquered body, a taped hilt, a sword guard (tsuba) and decorative metal fittings. Though the original purpose was to protect a sword from damage, from early times on Japanese sword mountings became a status symbol and were used to add dignity. Starting in the Heian period, a sharp distinction was made between swords designed for use in battle and those for ceremonial use. Tachi long swords were worn edge down suspended by two cords or chains from the waist belt. The cords were attached to two eyelets on the scabbard.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Dull began {{a search}} for a new {{official}} symbol to represent the Institute. He specifically wanted a classic pre-war Ford. Dull's search would entail newspaper ads, radio commercials, and other means to locate this vehicle. The search took him throughout the state and country, but no suitable vehicle was found until the autumn of 1960. Dean Dull spotted <b>a</b> <b>polished</b> 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in Towers Dormitory. The owner was Captain Ted J. Johnson, Atlanta's chief Delta Air Lines pilot.|$|E
5|$|When a storm begins, {{the crew}} start to set sail. Toby drops <b>a</b> <b>polished</b> crown while {{bringing}} his father a coat. The Siren is summoned and takes Toby. Soon, Rory {{falls into the}} ocean, and the Doctor rationalises that the Siren has shown intelligence and will likely get to Rory before he drowns and convinces her to save him. Believing the victims are not dead, the Doctor convinces Avery and Amy to prick themselves to get the Siren to take them. The Doctor's suspicions are confirmed when the Siren's touch actually teleports them to an alien spaceship, invisible {{in the same spot}} the pirate ship is located.|$|E

5|$|Just {{like the}} player's pilot, {{most of the}} other {{characters}} are low-key. The non-player character Admiral Aken Bosch, however, plays a crucial part in moving the story. As a prominent antagonist from the start, he sparks off a rebellion which escalates the scale of action, and brings in the other antagonist force, the Shivans, into the story. The storytelling took on a character-driven approach with expositions taking the form of cutscenes in which Bosch gives out monologues, revealing the purpose and driving forces behind his actions. A few established voice actors were brought in to give <b>a</b> <b>polished</b> touch to the voices in the game. Academy Award nominee Robert Loggia voiced the player's commanding officer, Admiral Petrarch, and Admiral Bosch was voiced by Ronny Cox. Kurtwood Smith and Stephen Baldwin participated in bit roles as well.|$|E
5|$|Pottery finds showed better finish {{compared}} to the earlier Period I. The pots were of polished black ware, mostly handmade, {{in the form of}} a dish with stand, a high-necked jar, and so forth. Also found was a wheel turned red ware pot which contained 950 beads made from carnelian and agate (inferred as items for sale), which was thought to belong to the later part of this period. A very impressive painted pottery ware recovered from this period was a globular red ware pot made on a turntable; the painting on the pot was of a wild goat of black colour with long horns and hanging ears. Another pottery item which is of interest is <b>a</b> <b>polished</b> black ware in globular shape jar with a long neck and flaring mouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{inventor}} Nicéphore Niépce {{produced the}} first permanent photograph on <b>a</b> <b>polished</b> pewter plate in Paris in 1825, and then developed the process with Louis Daguerre. The work of Étienne-Jules Marey in the 1880s contributed considerably {{to the development}} of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of Man Ray and Maurice Tabard. Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including Eugène Atget, noted for his depictions of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville has become iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), Marcel Bovis, noted for his night scenes, and others such as Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Cartier-Bresson. Poster art also became an important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, Eugène Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges de Feure, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Gavarni, and Alphonse Mucha.|$|E

5|$|Yorkshire {{police officer}} Ronald Craven (Bob Peck) is {{returning}} {{home with his}} daughter Emma (Joanne Whalley) having picked her up from a meeting of an environmental organisation at her university campus. On the doorstep of their home Emma is shot dead. The police concentrate their effort {{on the theory that}} her murder was a botched attempt on Craven's life by a criminal he had been responsible for convicting. However, as Craven goes through Emma's belongings, he discovers a geiger counter and a gun. He also learns that Emma's body and her possessions are radioactive. Travelling to London to assist with the inquiry, he is contacted by Pendleton (Charles Kay), <b>a</b> <b>polished</b> official “attached to the Prime Minister's office”, who informs him that Emma was known to them as a terrorist and that it may have been her, not Craven, who was the gunman's target.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} the original PlayStation era graphics of Rally 2.0 would not hold up to modern standards on a high pixel density mobile display. To improve the graphical quality they introduced modern shader-based rendering and overhauled the textures. The engine specifications for the vehicles were retained from the classic Rally games. Although the models for the vehicles were also preserved, developers increased their resolution and added more detail and graphical layers to the car bodies. Other features that were carried over include the chassis deformation effects and realistic buildup of dirt on the vehicles. PhysX-based collision detection was implemented to enable more objects and debris to scatter. Changes were also made to lighting, audio, controls, and user interface. The team decided to omit a number of Rally 2.0 features, such as multiplayer, manual transmission, variable gear ratios, weather reports, and the cockpit camera view. Game producer Pete Harrison cited creating <b>a</b> <b>polished,</b> core rallying experience for mobile as {{the focal point of}} the project and felt that some features would not be suitable for the short play sessions that they expected from a portable racing game.|$|E

5|$|The Ramblin' Wreck, {{the iconic}} 1930 Ford Model A Sport coupe {{that serves as}} the {{official}} mascot of the student body, was acquired in this era. The Wreck is present at all major sporting events and student body functions, and leads the football team into Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, a duty it has performed since 1961. Dean of Student Affairs Jim Dull recognized a need for an official Ramblin' Wreck when he observed the student body's fascination with classic cars. Fraternities, in particular, would parade around their House Wrecks as displays of school spirit and enthusiasm. It was considered a rite of passage to own a broken-down vehicle. In 1960, Dull began a search for a new official symbol to represent the Institute. He specifically wanted a classic pre-war Ford. Dull's search employed newspaper ads, radio commercials, and other means to locate this vehicle. The search took him throughout the state and country, but no suitable vehicle was found until the autumn of 1960 when Dull spotted <b>a</b> <b>polished</b> 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in Towers Dormitory. The owner was Captain Ted J. Johnson, Atlanta's chief Delta Air Lines pilot. When Johnson returned to his car, he found a note from Dull attached to his windshield. Dull's note offered to purchase the car to serve as Georgia Tech's official mascot. Johnson, after great deliberation, agreed to take $1,000; he eventually returned the money in 1984 so that the car would be remembered as an official donation to Georgia Tech and the Alexander-Tharpe Fund. The Ramblin' Wreck was officially transferred to the Athletic Association on May 26, 1961.|$|E
