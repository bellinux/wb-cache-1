50|$|A single {{theatrical}} technician may regularly do {{one or more}} of {{the above}} jobs during load in, load outs (strike), rehearsal and performance. Performance technicians are generally divided between those backstage (stagehands, Stage Managers) and those in a control room (lighting and <b>audio</b> <b>technicians).</b> During load in and load out additional crew members may be needed due to the amount of work required to be completed in a short time span. Larger and more complex shows require larger crews and often personnel with specialized advanced skills to perform these job functions.|$|R
50|$|Backline guitar <b>technicians,</b> <b>audio</b> <b>technicians</b> {{and stage}} crew {{set up and}} put away the backline equipment. Backline gear that is used heavily will need regular {{maintenance}} {{to ensure that it}} provides reliable performance and high-quality sound. For example, pianos need to be tuned and maintained with new felts, tube amplifiers need servicing or new tubes, speaker cabinets may need to have new loudspeakers installed, and drums will need new drumheads. Drumkit moving parts, such as hi-hat cymbal stands, may need adjustments. Guitar techs usually deal with maintaining guitar amps and effects.|$|R
50|$|Many {{professional}} guitar players use 'tube amps' {{because of}} their renowned 'tone'. 'Tone' in this usage is referring to timbre, or pitch color, and {{can be a very}} subjective quality to quantify. Most <b>audio</b> <b>technicians</b> and scientists theorize that the 'even harmonic distortion' produced by valve tubes sounds more pleasing to the ear than transistors, regardless of style. Many of the musicians who use solid state amplification technology do so for its portability, low cost and high reliability, not its 'tone'. It is the tonal characteristics of valve tubes that have sustained them as the industry standard for guitars and studio microphone pre-amplification.|$|R

50|$|Professional audio, {{abbreviated}} as pro audio, {{refers to}} both an activity and {{a category of}} high quality, studio-grade audio equipment. Typically it encompasses sound recording, sound reinforcement system setup and audio mixing, and studio music production by trained sound engineers, audio engineers, record producers, and <b>audio</b> <b>technicians</b> who work in live event support and recording using audio mixers, recording equipment and sound reinforcement systems. In contrast, consumer audio equipment is a lower grade of gear which is used by regular people for the reproduction of sound in a private home on a home stereo or home cinema system.|$|R
50|$|Some {{professional}} audio stores {{sell the}} services of <b>audio</b> engineers, <b>audio</b> <b>technicians</b> and delivery personnel who can deliver and set up professional sound equipment and/or oversee the audio mixing of the different instruments and voices during a show or event. Some professional audio stores offer paid consulting services on professional audio issues. These consultants can come to a customer's venue, which may be a nightclub, church, conference center, auditorium or stadium, assess its professional audio needs, and recommend the types of components-speaker enclosures, mixing boards, microphone types, and so on-that would best suit this venue and the customer's budget.|$|R

50|$|Though less {{socially}} prestigious than a {{white collar}} professional, technicians play as major support roles in professions such as engineering, accountancy, nursing, medicine, architecture, and law. For instance, a dental technician is viewed of lower social status {{and a lower}} level of respect compared to a dentist. Experienced technicians in a specific tool domain typically have intermediate understanding of theory and expert proficiency in technique. As such, technicians are generally better versed in technique compared to average laymen and even general professionals in that field of technology. For example, although <b>audio</b> <b>technicians</b> are not as learned in acoustics as acoustical engineers, they are more proficient in operating sound equipment, and they will likely know more about acoustics than other studio staff such as repairmen.|$|R
