500|$|At {{the time}} of its initial release, the film had a mixed reception, with both {{positive}} and negative reviews. Bosley Crowther of the New York Times enjoyed the film, calling it [...] "... a nice little package of morbidity, <b>all</b> <b>wrapped</b> around in gloom." [...] Paul Meehan calls it [...] "a tepid potboiler of malfeasance and murder on the high seas." [...] John Brosnan described The Ghost Ship as [...] "a more conventional mystery-thriller involving a number of deaths on board a ship, but was produced with Lewton's customary attention to atmosphere." [...] The script has come in for significant praise, with Captain Stone being compared to Captain Queeg in The Caine Mutiny, Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick, and Captain Wolf Larsen in The Sea-Wolf. Other critics have pointed out that Stone and Merriam seem to have a father-son relationship, but that the perverseness of the script is that the father-figure becomes so enraged at his [...] "son's" [...] failings that he seeks to murder him.|$|E

We used the same guy who did the lighting setup for Lenny Kravitz's 'Are You Gonna Go My Way?' and Coldplay's 'Speed of Sound.' But it's also rough around the edges — we used a bunch of different processes when developing the film." [...] He also concluded with, [...] "...it's a big performance video. But it's them performing inside of this wind-tunnel of light. It's a lot of smoke and mirrors, and a lot of camera tricks.

[...] Ben Ratliff of The New York Times said [...] "7 Things" [...] "lists with talky insecurity what she hates about a guy" [...] and calls [...] "the seven things she likes [...] a shameless Disney ending".

[...] Kitsis also added that they had to include an"emotional spine to take us into the story or else it just becomes a bunch of moves or gags and stuff", eventually deciding on adding a mysterious destiny to Flynn and giving him a legendary aura - [...] "Kevin Flynn to us was Steve Jobs and Bill Gates <b>all</b> <b>wrapped</b> up into one and John Lennon". The writers decided to create the character of Clu as an evil embodiment of [...] "how you look back on your younger self, (...) that guy [...] thought he knew everything, but he really knew nothing". Bridges liked the idea of the dual perspectives, and contributed with the writers for the characterization of Flynn as a sanguine Zen master by suggesting them to get inspiration from various Buddhist texts. Part of the concepts emerged from a reunion the producers had with scientists from California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to discuss concepts such as isomorphic algorithms and the digitizing of organic matter.|$|E

[...] Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode a 9.6 out of 10, saying [...] "This episode is as close to a perfect as this show has come up this season. The family gets plenty of time to play off of one another, the jokes are quick and sharp, and it <b>all</b> <b>wraps</b> up not with some boring lesson being imparted by one character to another, but in some simple human truth about parents and their young kids.

500|$|Another {{controversy}} surrounding {{the dress was}} the question of its originality. Brooks Barnes of The New York Times wrote that the dress was [...] "derived" [...] from Incarnation, {{a painting of a}} white-haired girl wearing a meat dress by artist Mark Ryden. Sharon Clott of MTV also noted the similarity between Gaga's dress and Ryden's painting. Ryden was reportedly upset that Gaga did not acknowledge that she took inspiration from his work. Some in the art and fashion press remarked on the dress' similarity to , a meat dress made by Canadian sculptor Jana Sterbak in 1987 exhibited to considerable controversy at the National Gallery of Canada in 1991. Karen Rosenberg from The New York Times compared the dress to a series of photographs of Francis Bacon posing with sides of beef attached to his torso like wings in 1952, while The Daily Telegraph compared the dress to the original cover of The Beatles' 1966 album Yesterday and Today, and noted its similarity to the cover of the November 1983 The Undertones album <b>All</b> <b>Wrapped</b> Up, which showed a female model wearing a dress and gloves made of cuts of meat (mostly bacon) held in place with plastic wrap and a sausage necklace. Architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro had also designed a meat dress in 2006. An earlier example of a garment made from meat stitched together {{in the same way as}} the Lady Gaga meat dress was worn at the Slade School of Art postgraduate degree exhibition opening in London, England in July 1979, when performance artist Robert Connolly wore a two-piece suit made of slices of salami.|$|E

Club awarded the episode an A rating {{and noted that}} [...] "whatever reservations I may have over a three-episode story arc, this final entry {{does a good job}} of re-investing us in the show's basic ideals, returning us to a rough form of the status quo in a way that's exciting, emotionally powerful, and satisfying despite only incremental forward momentum". In addition, Handlen praised David Duchovny's performance, stating that he [...] "was on fire the whole episode". Tom Kessenich praised {{the second part of the}} episode and wrote [...] "'Redux II' is the standout hour of the two without question. With Scully on her deathbed, Mulder meets his sister only to lose her again and is put in a position where he may deal with the devil. The finale moments [...] are quite simply perfect and as good as any the show ever produced." [...] Shearman and Pearson rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted [...] " [...] is a likable enough little romp, but it's too leisurely to be exciting, too predictable to be revealing, and–most crucially, not really funny enough to be comedy. Vitaris gave the second part of the episode a slightly less negative review than the first, but only awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She criticized the ending, noting that [...] "it's <b>all</b> <b>wrapped</b> up neatly yet ambiguously." [...] However, Vitaris did note that [...] "what makes 'Redux II' tolerable is Duchovny, who always hits the right notes of anger, despair, grief, relief, or emotional numbness."

SoapNet noted that [...] "Chloe's world is turned upside down" [...] {{as a result of}} the diagnosis. The leukemia storyline spans into January 2012. Hendrickson was happy with the storyline, stating that [...] "it was my supporting actors who supported me through the entire shooting day, and the writing.

Billy is being forced away from town by his wife's father Victor Newman (Eric Braeden). Victor arranges for Billy to secretly be able to donate his bone marrow, saving Delia's life, though he passes the donation off as Kevin's. Hendrickson praised the writing for the storyline as a [...] "full arc" [...] which had a [...] "beginning, middle and an end". She said, [...] "It was a great story. I got to show a lot of range, and also got to work with some great supporting actors who were in those scenes." [...] For the 39th Daytime Emmy Awards, Hendrickson submitted the scenes in which Chloe is informed of Delia's leukemia, which allowed her to receive a nomination in the category of Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. In July 2013, Delia has a health scare.

40|$|The {{dispersion}} of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in aqueous media is of potential importance {{in a number}} of biomedical applications. CNT solubilization has been achieved via the non-covalent adsorption of lipids and detergent onto the tube surface. We use coarse-grained molecular dynamics to study the self-assembly of CNTs with various amphiphiles, namely a bilayer-forming lipid, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), and two species of detergent, dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine (DHPC) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). We find that for a low amphiphile/CNT ratio, DPPC, DHPC and LPC <b>all</b> <b>wrap</b> around the CNT. Upon increasing the number of amphiphiles, a transition in adsorption is observed: DPPC encapsulates the CNT within a cylindrical micelle, whilst both DHPC and LPC adsorb onto CNTs in hemimicelles. This study highlights differences in adsorption mechanism of bilayer-forming lipids and detergents on CNTs which may in the future be exploitable to enable enhancement of CNT solubilization whilst minimizing perturbation of cell membrane integrity...|$|R

Considering combined effect of variety and wrapping materials, fruits of the Kazi showed the longer duration of marketability among 10 varieties with all treatments. Weight loss of different guava varieties increased with increasing storage duration. Variety Kazi showed the lowest percentage of weight loss.
