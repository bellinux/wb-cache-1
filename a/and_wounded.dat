5|$|On the Coalition side, Mack {{was given}} {{much of the}} credit for Coburg's triumph. Blamed for the defeat, Miranda {{traveled}} to Paris to intrigue against Dumouriez. The Austro-Dutch reported losses of 97 officers, 2,762 rank and file and 779 horses. The French lost 4,000 killed <b>and</b> <b>wounded,</b> plus 1,000 men and 30 artillery pieces captured. General of Brigade Georges Guiscard de Bar was killed and four generals were wounded. Another source estimated Austrian losses as 2,600 killed <b>and</b> <b>wounded</b> and 400 missing while French casualties were 3,000 killed <b>and</b> <b>wounded</b> plus 1,000 missing or prisoners. Immediately after the battle, about 6,000 French volunteers deserted the colors and went home. Three days later, Dumouriez's army only numbered about 20,000 troops as the men deserted in hundreds. On 23 March there was a clash at Pellenberg where Coburg with 38,000 soldiers defeated Dumouriez with 22,000. The Austrians sustained 900 casualties while inflicting 2,000 on the French.|$|E

5|$|Anticipating Jourdan's move, Charles rushed {{his army}} toward battle at Würzburg on 1 September. Marshaling the {{divisions}} of Hotze, Sztáray, Kray, Johann Sigismund Riesch, Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein and Wartensleben, the Austrians won the Battle of Würzburg on 3 September, forcing the French {{to retreat to}} the Lahn river. Charles lost 1,500 casualties out of 44,000 troops there, while inflicting 2,000 casualties on the outnumbered French. Another authority gave French losses as 2,000 killed <b>and</b> <b>wounded</b> plus 1,000 men and seven guns captured, while Austrian losses numbered 1,200 killed <b>and</b> <b>wounded</b> and 300 captured.

Anxious to protect his magazines at Heilbronn, Charles halted at Pforzheim for a few days. For his part, Moreau would not believe that Charles had given up, so he waited around Ettlingen for several days. Meanwhile, the Austrians packed their supplies into wagons and headed east on 14 July. The next day, Moreau moved on Pforzheim but found the archduke gone.|$|E

50|$|Although the French made a {{fighting}} {{withdrawal from the}} battlefield and prevented the Chinese from piercing their line, casualties in the 2nd Brigade during the two-day battle were relatively heavy: 74 killed (including 7 officers) <b>and</b> 213 <b>wounded</b> (including 6 officers). Most of these casualties (70 killed <b>and</b> 188 <b>wounded)</b> were suffered on 24 March.

5|$|Reports on {{the number}} of killed <b>and</b> <b>wounded</b> aboard Chesapeake during the battle vary widely. Broke's after-action report from 6July states 70killed and 100wounded. Contemporary sources place the number between 48–61killed and 85–99wounded. Discrepancies in the number of killed <b>and</b> <b>wounded</b> are {{possibly}} caused by the addition of sailors who died of their wounds in the ensuing days after the battle. The counts for Shannon have fewer discrepancies with 23killed; 56wounded. Despite his serious injuries, Broke ordered repairs to both ships and they proceeded on to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Captain Lawrence died en route and was buried in Halifax with military honors. The British imprisoned his crew. Captain Broke survived his wounds and was later made a baronet.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, Jourdan {{experienced}} a setback in the north, during a clash at Sulzbach on 17 August, when Paul Kray's Austrians inflicted losses of 1,000 killed <b>and</b> <b>wounded</b> and 700 captured on their enemies while suffering losses of 900 killed <b>and</b> <b>wounded</b> and 200 captured. Despite the French losses, the French continued their advance. Wartensleben's army retreated behind the Naab River on 18 August and, as Jourdan closed {{up to the}} Naab, he posted Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte's division at Neumarkt in der Oberpfalz to observe Charles, hoping that would keep the Austrians from hitting him by surprise. Unbeknownst to them, though, south of the Danube, Charles received reinforcements that brought his strength up to 60,000 troops.

5|$|Soult {{was in a}} dilemma. He {{could not}} defend both the {{important}} southwestern port of Bordeaux and Toulouse.

Therefore, the French marshal determined to operate to the east in the direction of Toulouse. On 2 March, the Allies clashed with the French at Aire-sur-l'Adour in a combat that cost the French about 250 men killed <b>and</b> <b>wounded,</b> including 12 officers, and 100 captured. Hippolita Da Costa sent his Portuguese brigade to attack a strong position. When it was repulsed with losses of five officers and 100 men, Da Costa failed to rally the soldiers and was replaced in command. British losses were 156 killed <b>and</b> <b>wounded</b> in the 2nd Division. After this action with Hill, Harispe abandoned Aire. Soult withdrew to a position between Maubourguet and Plaisance where his army was left alone for ten days.|$|E
