That framework is rendered complex by frequent legislative reforms, the overlap of general rules and specific rules for some services, and the division of legislative powers among the European Community, the central government and regional governments. The various reform acts, both horizontal and sector-specific, have not always pursued homogenous goals, seeking in some cases to foster and in others to restrain competition. The rules for local public utilities have recently changed again: competitive tendering is now the standard mechanism for awarding contracts to supply services, but local authorities may still supply services through in-house providers or use other contract <b>award</b> <b>procedures</b> where they deem it impossible to introduce competitive mechanisms. regulation, local public utilities...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Corruption is, unfortunately, {{continually}} {{revealed in}} numerous areas of public affairs, but {{particularly in the}} field of public procurement, since few activities create greater temptations or offer more opportunities for corruption than public sector procurement. Civil law makes various provisions to deal with this phenomenon: repressive measures- more proper to criminal law- and preventive measures that aim to deter illegal activities. One preventive measure intended to reduce the opportunities for corrupt conduct is the exclusion from public contract <b>award</b> <b>procedures</b> of an applicant who has previously committed offences connected with corruption. The most recent Community Directives on public procurement make it mandatory to exclude from public procurement any bidder who has been sentenced by a final judgment having the force of res judicata for acts of corruption, fraud or participation in the activities of a criminal organisation. This paper assesses these measures and their impact on reducing corruption in public procurement. I...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{relative}} efficiency of auctions and negotiations {{is still a}} puzzle in the literature. While auctions are the prescribed procedures and the most used ones for public procurement, in the private sector, where buyers are free to choose their purchasing method, competitive tendering {{is far from being}} their preferred option (Bajari et al. 2009). In addition, recent empirical studies (Estache et al. 2009, Bajari et al. 2009) highlight some failures of auction procedures and identify conditions under which negotiation is more efficient. In particular, they show that auctions perform poorly when projects are complex. In this paper, our aim is to contribute to this debate by providing an empirical analysis of how awarding mechanisms are chosen in public procurement in France. To this end, we examine a comprehensive database of 76, 188 observations corresponding to the entire set of public procurement work contracts awarded between 2005 and 2007 in the construction sector. We find empirical regularities regarding the choice of <b>awarding</b> <b>procedures</b> by public buyers. However, most of these regularities do not coincide with what the theoretical literature considers as transaction-cost minimizing behaviours. In particular, the size of the construction projects as well as the length of contracts do not appear as key determinants of the choice of <b>awarding</b> <b>procedures,</b> which translates into costly renegotiations...|$|R
