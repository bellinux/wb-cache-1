5|$|A key {{question}} surrounding the FairTax {{is whether the}} tax {{has the ability to}} be revenue-neutral; that is, whether the tax would result in an increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues. Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods resulting in dramatically different tax rates making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The choice between static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.|$|E

In explaining how the willfulness element must be proven, the Court distinguished arguments about constitutionality of the tax law from statutory arguments <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> law.|$|E
25|$|Besides, Landale {{was one of}} {{the leading}} {{businessmen}} in the colony who repeatedly opposed the introduction of income tax. As early as during the Second World War, the government proposed for the introduction of the tax to support the British war effort in Europe and to subsidise the local defence budget. Landale {{was one of the}} members who were appointed to the War Revenue Committee by the government in October 1939, which was tasked to offer advice on the proposed new tax. The Committee later submitted its report in February 1940 in which Landale and other members expressed strong reservations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> proposal. Despite of their reservations, the government eventually managed to secure the support of the Committee to introduce the income tax in April 1940, having promised that the tax, as an interim measure to generate war revenue, would be repealed after the war. Ironically, although the government did repeal the tax after the war as promised, the tax was soon re-introduced in 1947, a move which was strongly opposed by Landale and other unofficial members of the Legislative Council. In response to the tax proposal, Landale requested that it should be put on hold for a year to have sufficient time for further review, but his request was turned down by the government. After heated debates, the bill to reintroduce the tax was read a third time and was passed in the Legislative Council in May 1947, notwithstanding that it was rarely voted against by three unofficial members, namely Chau Tsun-nin, Chau Sik-nin and Leo d'Almada e Castro. Landale, however, was compelled to vote for the Bill during the division.|$|E

2500|$|During World War II, an {{extremely}} high tax burden was imposed on Armenian, Greek and Jewish citizens of Turkey, and tax assessors had {{a free hand}} in determining the amount, often amounts {{that could not be}} paid. In the winter of 1942, hundreds who could not pay, including elderly men, were brought to the town of Aşkale, with very harsh winters, and made to shovel snow continually for as much as five months. Some were able to pay locals to perform the labor for them, and some succumbed to the cold and conditions, sleeping in barns, coffeehouses, or anywhere else they could get shelter.
