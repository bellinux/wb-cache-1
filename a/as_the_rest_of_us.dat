English flanker Peter Winterbottom attempted a pass to Campese's opposing winger Rory Underwood, who at that stage [...] "may have had an overlap," [...] when Campese knocked the ball forward. The referee ruled it a deliberate knock-on and awarded England a penalty." [...] The English hooker, Brian Moore, thought the referee should have awarded a penalty try. Moore was reported after the Test to have said, [...] " [...] sets himself up as the saviour of rugby. Yet {{when it comes down to}} it he's as cynical as anyone. I wouldn't criticise Campese except he called me mad as a hatter earlier this week." [...] Moore writes in Beware of the Dog: Rugby's Hard Man Reveals All that, ‘I have no issue with what Campese did; I would have done the same, and he got away with it. The point I make about what he did is that, as he has been shown to be as cynical <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> I don’t now want to hear lectures from him about the spirit of the game.’ ...|$|E
