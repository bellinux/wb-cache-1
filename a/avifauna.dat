40|$|The {{premise that}} Pleistocene ice ages played an {{important}} role in generating present-day species diversity has been challenged by genetic data indicating that most of the youngest terrestrial species on Earth coalesced long before major glacial advances. However, study has been biased towards faunas distributed at low latitudes that were not directly fragmented by advancing ice sheets. Using mitochondrial sequence divergence and a molecular clock, we compared the coalescence times of pairs of avian species belonging to superspecies complexes from the high-latitude boreal forest with those of sub-boreal and tropical <b>avifaunas</b> of the New World. Remarkably, all coalescence events in boreal superspecies date to the Pleistocene, providing direct evidence that speciation was commonly initiated during recent glacial periods. A pattern of endemism in boreal superspecies plausibly links the timing of divergence to the fragmentation of the boreal forest by ice sheets during the Mid- and Late Pleistocene. In contrast to the boreal superspecies, only 56 % of sub-boreal and 46 % of tropical superspecies members coalesced during the Pleistocene, suggesting that <b>avifaunas</b> directly fragmented by ice sheets experienced rapid rates of diversification, whereas those distributed farther south were affected to a lesser extent. One explanation for the absence of pre-Pleistocene superspecies in boreal <b>avifaunas</b> is that strong selection pressures operated in boreal refugia, causing superspecies members to achieve ecological differentiation at an accelerated rate...|$|R

5|$|Antbirds {{are common}} {{components}} of the <b>avifauna</b> of {{some parts of the}} Neotropics and are thought to be important in some ecological processes.

40|$|Previous {{analyses}} of the Emeryville Shellmound fauna suggested that ever-expanding late Holocene human populations of the San Francisco Bay area depressed {{a wide range of}} vertebrate taxa, including cormorants (Phalacrocorax), geese (Anserinae), and large shorebirds (e. g., Numenius, Limosa). Far-reaching implications for prehistoric human behavior, historical ecology, and modern conservation biology have re-sulted from that work. We test the generality of the bird-based conclusions here by documenting temporal trends in avifaunal abundances from five additional sites located on the San Francisco Peninsula. Analyses of these data reveal patterns identical to those found at Emeryville, showing significant declines through time in the relative abundances of both geese and cormorants between about 2000 and 700 B. P. New photon absorptiometric-based density data for cormorants, geese, and ducks (Anatinae) are used to determine if the declines through time in the relative abundances of geese and cormorants are correlated with variation in the extent of density-mediated attrition observed in these faunas. The data and analyses presented here suggest that while density-mediated attrition played a role in structuring element abundances in these <b>avifaunas,</b> {{there is no evidence that}} it varied systematically through time to produce the revealed patterns in taxonomic abundances. Resource depression thus remains a viable hypothesis for the declining abundances of large-sized waterbirds during the late Holocene of the San Francisco Bay region. The new bone density data we present should be useful to {{analyses of}} archaeological and paleontological <b>avifaunas</b> wherever these or related taxa are found around the world...|$|R
40|$|Aim: We {{explored}} {{whether one}} native bird (the yellow-throated miner Manorina flavigula) greatly affected {{the composition of}} <b>avifaunas</b> in > 500, 000 km(2) in northern Australia. Location: Rangelands of north-eastern Australia Methods: Repeated avian surveys were conducted in 368 locations, for which in-site vegetation and landscape-contextual measurements were made. Hierarchical Bayesian models {{were used to determine}} whether avian assemblages were affected by variation in abundances of the yellow-throated miner. Results: Variation in the abundances of the yellow-throated miner appeared to be governed largely by vegetation cover in surrounding landscapes. Summed abundances and richness of birds less massive than the yellow-throated miner (53 g) bird could not explain the patterns of variation in small-bodied species as well as the yellow-throated miner. There were no relationships between abundances and richness of larger species and abundances of the yellow-throated miner. Main conclusions: The genus Manorina appears to be a competitive despot insofar as species smaller than it are concerned. There now is strong evidence that the local composition of <b>avifaunas</b> over much of a continent is controlled by the indiscriminate aggression of a colonial genus. Many of the existing ideas in community ecology that have been proffered for explaining the composition of vertebrate assemblages are inadequate for these assemblages given the profound influence of species of the genus Manorina. The mooted agricultural expansion of development in northern Australia almost certainly would favour the spread of the yellow-throated miner and probably will depress the occurrence and abundances of small-bodied bird species...|$|R
5|$|The New Zealand forest {{relies heavily}} on frugivorous birds for seed dispersal: about 70% of the woody plants have fruits that are {{probably}} dispersed by birds, which included the huia. The range of fruits eaten by the huia is difficult to establish: hinau (Elaeocarpus dentatus), pigeonwood (Hedycarya arborea) and various species of Coprosma are recorded by Buller, and they were also recorded as eating the fruits of kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides). The extinction of the huia and other frugivorous New Zealand bird species including the moa and piopio, and the diminishing range of many others, including the kiwi, weka, and kōkako, has left few effective seed dispersers in the New Zealand forest. For plants with fruit greater than 1cm in diameter, kereru are the sole remaining dispersers in the ecosystem, and they are rare or extinct in some areas. This depletion of <b>avifauna</b> in the forest ecosystem may be having major impacts on processes such as forest regeneration and seed dispersal.|$|E
5|$|Puerto Rico's <b>avifauna</b> {{has diminished}} due to {{extinction}} and extirpation, either by natural forces or human intervention.

The species {{is believed to have}} become extinct as a result of habitat alteration after the Wisconsin glaciation. At least six endemic species have become extinct in the last millennia: Puerto Rican barn owl (Tyto cavatica), Puerto Rican caracara (Polyborus latebrosus), Puerto Rican conure (Aratinga chloroptera maugei), Puerto Rican woodcock (Scolopax anthonyi), Puerto Rican quail-dove (Geotrygon larva), and the Antillean cave rail (Nesotrochis debooyi). With a population of 13 individuals in 1975, the Puerto Rican parrot almost became the seventh, but conservation efforts helped save the species from extinction. However, it {{is still one of the}} ten most critically endangered birds in the world. Four Puerto Rican birds, the Hispaniolan parakeet, the white-necked crow, the Cuban crow, and the limpkin, became extirpated after Puerto Rico's population expansion in the latter half of the nineteenth century and three more species, the black-bellied whistling duck, the black rail, and the American flamingo, no longer breed in the archipelago.|$|E

Auk, 134 (2), 443 - 465. doi: 10. 1642 /auk- 16 - 228. 1 Altitudinal {{bird migration}} involves annual seasonal movements {{up and down}} elevational gradients. Despite the fact that species from montane <b>avifaunas</b> worldwide engage in altitudinal migration, the patterns, causes, and prevalence of these movements are poorly understood. This is particularly true in North America where {{the overwhelming majority of}} avian migration research has focused on obligate, long-distance, temperate-tropical movements. Elsewhere in the world, most altitudinal migrants are partial migrants, making downhill movements to nonbreeding areas. However, spatial and temporal patterns, the prevalence and predictability of migration at individual and population levels, and the ultimate ecological factors selecting for movement behavior vary considerably among taxa and regions. I conducted a systematic survey of the evidence for altitudinal migration to fill gaps in our understanding of this behavior among the landbirds of North America and Hawaii. Altitudinal migration was as prevalent as in other <b>avifaunas,</b> occurring in > 20 % of continental North American and nearly 30 % of Hawaiian species. Of the species wintering within the USA and Canada, similar to 30 % engage in altitudinal migrations. Altitudinal migrants are far more common in the West, are taxonomically and ecologically diverse, and North American species exhibit patterns similar to altitudinal migrants elsewhere in the world. Because altitudinal migration systems are relatively tractable, they present excellent opportunities for testing hypotheses regarding migration generally. Altitudinal migration has likely been overlooked in North America due to contingency in the history of ornithological research. Our need to understand the patterns and causes of altitudinal migrations has never been greater due to emerging environmental threats to montane systems...|$|R
