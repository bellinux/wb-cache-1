2500|$|No coal {{deposits}} {{are known}} from the Early Triassic, {{and those in the}} Middle Triassic are thin and low-grade. This [...] "coal gap" [...] has been explained in many ways. It has been suggested that new, more aggressive fungi, insects and vertebrates evolved, and killed vast numbers of trees. These decomposers themselves suffered heavy losses of species during the extinction, and are not considered a likely cause of the coal gap. It could simply be that all coal forming plants were rendered extinct by the P–Tr extinction, and that it took 10 million years for a new suite of plants to adapt to the moist, acid conditions of peat bogs. On the other hand, abiotic factors (not caused by organisms), such as decreased rainfall or increased input of clastic sediments, may also be to blame. Finally, {{it is also true that}} there are very few sediments of any type {{known from the}} Early Triassic, and the lack of coal may simply reflect this scarcity. This opens the possibility that coal-producing ecosystems may have responded to the changed conditions by relocating, perhaps to <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> have no sedimentary record for the Early Triassic. For example, in eastern Australia a cold climate had been the norm for a long period of time, with a peat mire ecosystem adapted to these conditions. Approximately 95% of these peat-producing plants went locally extinct at the P–Tr boundary; Interestingly, coal deposits in Australia and Antarctica disappear significantly before the P–Tr boundary.|$|E
60|$|It may be {{said that}} the changes here {{indicated}} are not warranted by an actual knowledge of continuous Tertiary deposits over the situations of the alleged marine channels; but it is no less certain that the seas in which any particular strata were deposited were always more extensive than the fragments of those strata now existing, and often immensely more extensive. The Eocene deposits of Europe, for example, have certainly undergone enormous denudation both marine and subaërial, and may have once covered <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> now find older deposits (as the chalk once covered the weald), while a portion of them may lie concealed under Miocene, Pliocene, or recent beds. We find them widely scattered over Europe and Asia, and often elevated into lofty mountain ranges; and we should certainly err far more seriously in confining the Eocene seas to the exact <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> now find Eocene rocks, than in liberally extending them, so as to connect the several detached portions of the formation whenever there is no valid argument against our doing so. Considering then, that some {{one or more of the}} sea-communications here indicated almost certainly existed during Eocene and Miocene times, let us endeavour to estimate the probable effect such communications would have upon the climate of the northern hemisphere.|$|E

Among these electronic media we distinguished between the African electronic media whereby we sampled Niger and Cameroon republics, which are Francophone neigboring Nigeria and the foreign electronic media whereby we sampled BBC-Hausa service and the VOA-Hausa service. Through various instruments of research, the study comes up with various performances of the Hausa Broadcasters in terms of IOVs, IOAs, IOCs, and IOIs. The study identifies that there are various degrees of variations among Hausa Broadcasters in the use of terms and concepts in the electronic media in all the areas. These variations are observed at different levels i. e. among Hausa Broadcasters in the same electronic media within the same dialect area and across electronic media. These variations occasion various degrees of performances among Hausa Broadcasters in terms of IOAs. The study further identifies various degrees of performances in terms of IOCs, which result in various degrees of performances in terms of IOIs. The performances of the Hausa Broadcasters result in confusions and breakdown of communication as reported by Hausa listeners. These variations and inconsistencies in the use of Hausa terms and concepts over the electronic media are tied up to various factors. The lack of a language monitoring body saddled with the responsibility of supervising Hausa language development in the media may be the cause of such discrepancies in the use of terms of concepts over all the electronic media that broadcast and feature programmes in Hausa within Nigeria as well as outside...|$|R
