With fund management contracts – indirect sale of information – banks can credibly commit to collaborate and <b>add</b> <b>noise</b> into prices. This is a way to circumvent the Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) paradox: when information is costly, by commiting to <b>add</b> <b>noise,</b> the banks can recover the cost of collecting information and enter the market. By contrast, when information is costless, even with a large number of sellers of information entering the market prices are not fully informative...|$|R
40|$|Various {{situations}} where a signal {{is enhanced by}} noise through stochastic resonance are now known. This paper contributes to determining general conditions under which improvement by noise can be a priori decided as feasible or not. We focus on the detection of a known signal in additive white noise. Under the assumptions of a weak signal and a sufficiently large sample size, it is proved, with an inequality based on the Fisher information, that improvement by <b>adding</b> <b>noise</b> is never possible, generically, in these conditions. However, under less restrictive conditions, an example of signal detection is shown with favorable action of <b>adding</b> <b>noise.</b> Fabing Duan, François Chapeau-Blondeau, Derek Abbot...|$|R

5000|$|Music {{sequencer}} software, such as Pro Tools, Logic Audio {{and many}} others, {{are the most}} widely used form of contemporary music technology in the 2000s. Such programs allow the user to record acoustic sounds with a microphone, mix tracks record or MIDI musical sequences, which may then be organized along a timeline and edited on a flat-panel display of a computer or Digital Audio Workstation. Musical segments recorded on can be copied and duplicated ad infinitum, without any loss of fidelity or <b>added</b> <b>noise</b> (a major contrast from analog recording, in which every copy leads to a loss of fidelity and <b>added</b> <b>noise).</b> Digital music can be edited and processed using a multitude of audio effects. Contemporary classical music sometimes uses computer-generated sounds, either pre-recorded or generated/manipulated live, in conjunction or [...] with classical acoustic instruments like the cello or violin. Classical and other notated types of music are frequently written on scorewriter software.|$|E

The resulting AMY 1 chip used 64 oscillators and <b>added</b> <b>noise</b> generators to provide special effects needed in games. However the AMY was never released, and a 3rd party effort to produce a low-cost synth based on the chip ended when Atari threatened a lawsuit.|$|E

The <b>noise</b> <b>added</b> to the aggregate of each zone yields to the Differential Privacy property of the aggregate load data of each zone z. Due to the immunity against post-processing (cf. “Differential Privacy” section), the overall aggregate load that is computed as the sum is differentially private.|$|R

50|$|The World War II voice {{scrambler}} SIGSALY {{was also}} a form of one-time system. It <b>added</b> <b>noise</b> to the signal {{at one end and}} removed it at the other end. The noise was distributed to the channel ends in the form of large shellac records which were manufactured in unique pairs. There were both starting synchronization and longer-term phase drift problems which arose and were solved before the system could be used.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that one}} can only speak of the noise {{temperature}} of a component or source whose impedance has a substantial (and measurable) resistive component. Thus it doesn't make sense {{to talk about the}} noise temperature of a capacitor or of a voltage source. The noise temperature of an amplifier refers to the noise that would be added at the amplifier's input (relative to the input impedance of the amplifier) in order to account for the <b>added</b> <b>noise</b> observed following amplification.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a seminal}} paper {{published}} in the AES Journal, Lipshitz and Vanderkooy pointed out that different noise types, with different probability density functions (PDFs) behave differently when used as dither signals, and suggested optimal levels of dither signal for audio.

30|$|To {{evaluate}} the adaptiveness of this evolutionary integrated classifier, the original NEU defect data set and 13 defect data sets formed by <b>adding</b> <b>noise</b> to the NEU defect data set were used.

5000|$|Location of maxima and minima in {{experimental}} data curves. This was the application that first motivated Savitzky. The first derivative of a function is zero at a maximum or minimum. The diagram shows data points {{belonging to a}} synthetic Lorentzian curve, with <b>added</b> <b>noise</b> (blue diamonds). Data are plotted {{on a scale of}} half width, relative to the peak maximum at zero. The smoothed curve (red line) and 1st. derivative (green) were calculated with 7-point cubic Savitzky-Golay filters. Linear interpolation of the first derivative values at positions either side of the zero-crossing gives the position of the peak maximum. 3rd. derivatives can also be used for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after World War II, Dr. Olson {{conducted}} an experiment, now considered a classic, {{to determine the}} preferred bandwidth for the reproduction of music. Previous experimenters had found that listeners seemed to prefer a high-frequency cutoff of 5000 Hz for reproduced music. Dr. Olson suspected that this was likely due to imperfections in the sound, especially in the higher frequencies, as reproduced by equipment in common use at the time. These imperfections included clicks and pops (from 78 rpm recordings), <b>added</b> <b>noise</b> (from AM radio broadcast static), hiss and harmonic distortion (from amplifier circuits), and non linear frequency response from primitive loudspeaker designs. If the sound was free of these problems, he reasoned, listeners would prefer full frequency reproduction.|$|E
5000|$|From {{this point}} of view, the A-law and μ-law {{algorithms}} (G.711) used in traditional PCM digital telephony {{can be seen as}} an earlier precursor of speech encoding, requiring only 8 bits per sample but giving effectively 12 bits of resolution. The logarithmic companding laws are consistent with human hearing perception in that a low-amplitude noise is heard along a low-amplitude speech signal but is masked by a high-amplitude one. Although this would generate unacceptable distortion in a music signal, the peaky nature of speech waveforms, combined with the simple frequency structure of speech as a periodic waveform having a single fundamental frequency with occasional <b>added</b> <b>noise</b> bursts, make these very simple instantaneous compression algorithms acceptable for speech.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a line with {{noise in the}} simplest case. Loss does not <b>add</b> <b>noise.</b> Amplification via phase insensitive amplifiers do <b>add</b> <b>noise.</b> A lower bound of this capacity is the quantum analog to the Shannon capacity of a linear channel with additive white Gaussian noise, namely the difference of the Von Neumann entropy of the signal plus noise at {{the output of the}} line and the entropy of the noise alone. We show that this expression is indeed the capacity for the case of an amplifier with infinitesimal gain G = 1 +ϵ, and for a cascade of an amplifier with arbitrary gain and a large loss, such that the overall gain of the cascade is infinitesimal...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of only one observation, one of the multiple-observation {{ensembles}} is mimicked by adding not arbitrary but different copies of white noise, wi(t), to that single observation as given in the equation. Although <b>adding</b> <b>noise</b> may result in smaller signal to-noise ratio, the <b>added</b> white <b>noise</b> will provide a uniform reference scale distribution to facilitate EMD; therefore, the low signal-noise ratio {{does not affect the}} decompositionmethod but actually enhances it to avoid the mode mixing.

40|$|Keywords: A {{well known}} method for privacy-preserving data mining {{is that of}} randomization. In randomization, we <b>add</b> <b>noise</b> to the data so that the {{behavior}} of the individual records is masked. However, the aggregate behavior of the data distribution can be reconstructed by subtracting out the noise from the data. The reconstructed distribution is often sufficient for a variety of data mining tasks such as classification. In this chapter, we will provide a survey of the randomization method for privacy-preserving data mining. Randomization, privacy quantification, perturbation. In the randomization method, we <b>add</b> <b>noise</b> to the data in order to mask the values of the records.
