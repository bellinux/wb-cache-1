Our technique yields a high-density, regular grid of wind velocity vectors that is advantageous over {{a limited number of}} scattered wind vectors that result from manual cloud tracking. The high-velocity collar of the GRS is clearly seen from our velocity vector map, and highest wind velocities are measured to be around 170 m s− 1. The high resolution of the mosaics have also enabled us to map turbulent eddies inside the chaotic central region of the GRS, similar to those mapped by Sada et al. (1996) and Vasavada et al. (1998). Using the wind velocity measurements, we computed particle trajectories around the GRS as well as maps of relative and <b>absolute</b> <b>vorticities.</b> We have discovered a narrow ring of cyclonic vorticity that surrounds the main anti-cyclonic high-velocity collar.

40|$|A {{potential}} pseudodensity {{principle is}} derived for the quasi-static primitive equations on the sphere. An {{important step in}} the derivation of this principle is the introduction of “vorticity coordinates”—that is, new coordinates whose Jacobian {{with respect to the}} original spherical coordinates is the dimensionless <b>absolute</b> isentropic <b>vorticity.</b> The vorticity coordinates are closely related to Clebsch variables and are the primitive equation generalizations of the geostrophic coordinates used in semigeostrophic theory. The vorticity coordinates can be used to transform the primitive equations into a canonical form. This form is mathematically similar to the geostrophic relation. There is flexibility in the choice of the potential function appearing in the canonical momentum equations. This flexibility can be used to force the vorticity coordinates to move with some desired velocity, which results in an associated simplification of the material derivative operator. The end result is analogous to the way ageostrophic motions become implicit when geostrophic coordinates are used in semigeostrophic theory...|$|R

50|$|Given {{that the}} lapse rate {{is not a}} {{conservative}} quantity when the tropopause is considered for stratosphere-troposphere exchanges studies, there exists an alternative definition named dynamic tropopause. It is formed {{with the aid of}} potential vorticity, which is defined as the product of the isentropic density, i.e. the density that arises from using potential temperature as the vertical coordinate, and the <b>absolute</b> <b>vorticity,</b> given that this quantity attains quite different values for the troposphere and the stratosphere. Instead of using the vertical temperature gradient as the defining variable, the dynamic tropopause surface is expressed in potential vorticity units (PVU). Given that the <b>absolute</b> <b>vorticity</b> is positive in the Northern Hemisphere and negative in the Southern Hemisphere, the threshold value should be taken as positive north of the Equator and negative south of it. Theoretically, to define a global tropopause in this way, the two surfaces arising from the positive and negative thresholds need to be matched near the equator using another type of surface such as a constant potential temperature surface. Nevertheless, the dynamic tropopause is useless at equatorial latitudes because the isentropes are almost vertical. For the extratropical tropopause in the Northern Hemisphere the WMO established a value of 1.5 PVU, but greater values ranging between 2 and 3.5 PVU have been traditionally used.|$|E
50|$|Sverdrup balance may {{be thought}} of as a {{consistency}} relationship for flow which is dominatedby the Earth's rotation. Such flow will be characterized by weak rates of spin comparedto that of the earth.Any parcel at rest with respect to the surface of the earth must match the spin of the earth underneath it. Looking down on the earth at the north pole, this spin is in a counterclockwise direction, which is defined as positive rotation or vorticity. At the south pole it is in a clockwise direction, corresponding to negative rotation. Thus to move a parcel of fluid from the south to the north without causing it to spin, it is necessary to add sufficient (positive)rotation so as to keep it matched with the rotation of the earth underneath it. The left-hand side of the Sverdrup equation represents the motion required to maintain this match between the <b>absolute</b> <b>vorticity</b> of a water column and the planetary vorticity, whilethe right represents the applied force of the wind.|$|E

5000|$|Carl-Gustaf Rossby first {{introduced}} potential vorticity in his 1936 paper [...] "Dynamics of steady ocean currents {{in the light}} of experimental fluid mechanics". This work was based on an analysis of a shallow water model of the Gulf Stream. The concept was developed further, within a few years of Rossby's seminal paper, by Hans Ertel. Mathematically, Ertel's form of potential vorticity is given by the equation:where [...] is the fluid density, [...] is the <b>absolute</b> <b>vorticity</b> and [...] is the gradient of the potential temperature. It can be shown through a combination of the first law of thermodynamics and momentum conservation that potential vorticity can only be changed by diabatic heating (such as latent heat released from condensation) or frictional processes. This conservation is the atmospheric equivalent to angular momentum. A spinning ice skater with her arms spread out laterally can accelerate her rate of spin by contracting her arms. Similarly, when a vortex of air is broad, it is in turn, slow. When the air converges, to maintain potential vorticity, the air speed increases, resulting in a stretched ring vortex. Divergence causes the vortex to spread, slowing down the rate of spin.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{solutions}} to the quadratic gradient wind equation are examined using 200 -mb data for two selected cases. Under conditions of anticyclonic flow, both solutions are shown to have relevance. The normal solution is valid for wind speeds less than twice geostrophic, whereas the "anomalous " solution applies for wind speeds greater than twice the geostrophic value. For both cases, wind speeds of {{more than three times}} the geostrophic value were detected synoptically over large areas of the United States. Areas of negative <b>absolute</b> <b>vorticity</b> were generally found within the anomalous flow regions. The absolute value of the <b>absolute</b> <b>vorticity</b> approached zhe local value of the Coriolis parameter. Although cause-effect relationships are difficult to ascertain, the coexistence of negative <b>absolute</b> <b>vorticity</b> and anomalous flow implies stability. Instability would be expected in regions where the anomalous flow alone was observed. Manifestation of this instability in the form of clear-air turbulence (CAT) is suggested.

Scaling considerations of the divergence equation show that the {{validity of}} the balance approximation hinges on the smallness of the nondimensional product /) 3 (ny /hr). The first(d 9 z 9 n n term represents the ratio of asymmetric horizontal divergence to asymmetric vertical vorticity for azimuthal wavenumber n, while the second term represents a Rossby number based upon the azimuthal mean tangential wind and <b>absolute</b> vertical <b>vorticity</b> of the hurricane vortex. Wind observations of Hurricane Gloria (1985) indicate that this product is not at all small in the near-vortex region (several hundred kilometers beyond the radius of maximum tangential winds) where asymmetric convergence forced by surface friction and cumulus convection is typically large. Although the Gloria observations represent only a single case, there are dynamical reasons to expect this product to be O(1) just above the hurricane boundary layer in steadily translating hurricanes. The meteorological relevance of these results to the problem of balance dynamics in hurricanes is briefly discussed. 1...|$|R

40|$|A first observationally-based {{estimation}} of departures from gradient wind balance during secondary eyewall formation is presented. The study {{is based on}} the Atlantic Hurricane Edouard (2014). This storm was observed during the National Aeronautics and Space Administrations (NASA) Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS 3) experiment, a field campaign conducted in collaboration with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). A total of 135 dropsondes are analyzed in two separate time periods: one named the secondary eyewall formation period and the other one referred to as the decaying-double eyewalled storm period. During the secondary eyewall formation period, a time when the storm was observed to have only one eyewall, the diagnosed agradient force has a secondary maxima that coincides with the radial location of the secondary eyewall observed in the second period of study. The maximum spin up tendency of the radial influx of <b>absolute</b> vertical <b>vorticity</b> is within the boundary layer in the region of the eyewall of the storm and the spin up tendency structure elongates radially outward into the secondary region of supergradient wind, where the secondary wind maxima is observed in the second period of study. An analysis of the boundary layer averaged vertical structure of equivalent potential temperature reveals a conditionally unstable environment in the secondary eyewall formation region. These findings support the hypothesis that deep convective activity in this region contributed to spin up of the boundary layer tangential winds and the formation of a secondary eyewall that is observed during the decaying-double eyewalled storm period...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{growth of}} {{asymmetric}} perturbations and {{their interactions with}} the symmetric flow are investigated for wind profiles in a tropical cyclone with instability in its outer region. Three tangential wind profiles are examined: TC 1, a strong barotropic instability profile in the outer region; TC 2, a stable wind profile; and TC 3, a weaker instability profile comparing to TC 1 with a larger distance between the inner negative and the outer positive vorticity gradient centres. An eigenvalue analysis indicates that azimuthal wave-number two is the most unstable mode in both TC 1 and TC 3, with an e-folding time-scale of about 1 and 9 days, respectively. Numerical simulations using a linear barotropic model, with an initial asymmetry specified in the outer region, confirm the eigenvalue analysis. A mechanism is provided to explain the difference between simulations in TC 1 and TC 2. In both the stable and unstable case, an inner asymmetry is induced by the initial outer asymmetry acting on the symmetric vorticity gradient. Subsequently, the newly generated inner asymmetry feeds back positively to the outer asymmetry with the unstable profile. Because of this positive feedback, the inner and the outer asymmetries maintain an up-shear phase tilting, leading to a continuous energy transfer from the symmetric flow to the asymmetric perturbation. In the stable TC 2, the inner asymmetry could not amplify the outer initial asymmetry {{as there is no}} basic-state radial vorticity gradient there. Also due to this feedback process, disturbances grow faster where the (<b>absolute)</b> basic-state <b>vorticity</b> gradients are large. Therefore, the position of an initial disturbance plays a minor role in determining the outcome of the system...|$|R

Two types of baroclinic, ageostrophic instability, AI 1 and AI 2, {{are found in}} odd-symmetric U¯¯¯(z) for intermediate Rossby number (Ro). AI 1 has zero frequency; it appears in a continuous transformation of the unstable mode properties between classic baroclinic instability (BCI) and centrifugal instability (CI). It begins to occur at intermediate Ro values and horizontal wavenumbers (k,l) that are far from l= 0 or k= 0, where {{the growth rate of}} BCI or CI is the strongest. AI 1 grows by drawing kinetic energy from the mean flow, and the perturbation converts kinetic energy to potential energy. The instability AI 2 has inertia critical layers (ICL); hence it is associated with inertia-gravity waves. For an unstable AI 2 mode, the coupling is either between an interior balanced shear wave and an inertia-gravity wave (BG), or between two inertia-gravity waves (GG).

40|$|Oceanic large- and meso-scale flows {{are nearly}} {{balanced}} in forces between Earth’s rotation and density stratification effects (i. e. geostrophic, hydrostatic balance associated with small Rossby and Froude numbers). In this regime advective cross-scale interactions mostly drive energy toward larger scales (i. e. inverse cascade). However, viscous energy dissipation occurs at small scales. So {{how does the}} energy reservoir at larger scales leak toward small-scale dissipation to arrive at climate equilibrium? Here we solve the linear instability problem of a balanced flow in a rotating and continuously stratified fluid far away from any boundaries (i. e. an interior jet). The basic flow is unstable not only to geostrophic baroclinic and barotropic instabilities, but also to ageostrophic instabilities, leading {{to the growth of}} small-scale motions that we hypothesize are less constrained by geostrophic cascade behaviours in a nonlinear regime and thus could escape from the inverse energy cascade. This instability is investigated in the parameter regime of moderate Rossby and Froude numbers, below the well-known regimes of gravitational, centrifugal, and Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. The ageostrophic instability modes arise with increasing Rossby number through a near-degeneracy of two unstable modes with coincident phase speeds. The near-degeneracy occurs in the neighbourhood of an identified criterion for the non-integrability of the ‘isentropic balance equations’ (namely A- S= 0 with A the <b>absolute</b> vertical <b>vorticity</b> and S the horizontal strain rate associated with the basic flow), beyond which development of an unbalanced component of the flow is expected.

However, due to the inherent numerical dissipation in the advection step of flow simulation, current Euler and RANS field solvers tend to damp these vortices too fast.
