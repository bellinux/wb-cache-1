5|$|Indiana fielded Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff and {{returned}} it to their 25-yard line. The Hoosiers <b>attempted</b> <b>a</b> long pass, but the throw fell incomplete and the quarter {{came to an end}} with the score still tied at 77.|$|E
5|$|Several {{researchers}} have <b>attempted</b> <b>a</b> thorough evaluation of criticisms {{and weaknesses of}} NVC and assessed significant challenges in its application. These span a range of potential problems, from the practical to the theoretical, and include concerns gathered from study participants and researchers.|$|E
5|$|The {{newly created}} Army Group Vistula, {{under the command}} of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, <b>attempted</b> <b>a</b> counter-attack, but this had failed by 24 February. The Red Army then drove on to Pomerania, {{clearing}} the right bank of the Oder River, thereby reaching into Silesia.|$|E
25|$|If {{a player}} is fouled while <b>attempting</b> <b>a</b> shot and the shot is unsuccessful, the player is awarded {{a number of}} free throws equal {{to the value of}} the <b>attempted</b> shot. <b>A</b> player fouled while <b>attempting</b> <b>a</b> regular {{two-point}} shot thus receives two shots, and a player fouled while <b>attempting</b> <b>a</b> three-point shot receives three shots.|$|R
5000|$|The {{advantage}} rule, where {{a referee}} allows play to continue after an infringement, but {{will return to}} the infringement if they don't believe the awarded team has taken [...] "advantage" [...] enough, can be an attractive situation in which to <b>attempt</b> <b>a</b> drop goal. If a team is playing under penalty advantage, and unsuccessfully <b>attempts</b> <b>a</b> drop goal, then the referee may return to the original penalty. The team could then opt to <b>attempt</b> <b>a</b> penalty goal, giving them a second opportunity to score the three points.|$|R

5|$|After another Chicago punt, the Colts {{advanced}} to the Bears' 36-yard line before Tillman ended the drive by forcing and recovering a fumble from tight end Bryan Fletcher. But on the next play, Grossman fumbled a snap, and Colts defensive lineman Raheem Brock recovered the ball. Manning then led the Colts to Chicago's 17-yard line. With two seconds left, Vinatieri <b>attempted</b> <b>a</b> 36-yard field goal, but his kick sailed wide left, and the score remained 16–14 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the punt, Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan connected on a 31-yard pass to wide receiver Brandon Robinson. As before, however, the offense stalled. On 4th-and-1 from the Virginia Tech 30-yard line, Ryan <b>attempted</b> <b>a</b> pass that fell incomplete, turning {{the ball over}} on downs. As a result of pressure applied by the Boston College defense, the Hokies continued to have difficulty moving the ball.|$|E
5|$|After the turnover, Texas <b>attempted</b> <b>a</b> trick play, but {{the pass}} {{by a wide}} {{receiver}} was knocked down by the Virginia Tech defense. After an eight-yard gain on a running play, Texas was penalized 10yards for holding. The Longhorns were unable to regain the yardage lost to the penalty and punted to the Hokies. With 2:15 remaining in the opening quarter, Tech fair caught the punt at its 19-yard line.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{settlers}} received {{the benefit of}} a section of public opinion, politically and legally every decision was going the way of the railroad. In March 1880, Stanford himself <b>attempted</b> <b>a</b> reconciliation by appearing in Hanford and meeting with the Settler's League in an attempt to find some sort of compromise.|$|E
5|$|At Cage Rage 20, in {{a rematch}} with Ashleigh Grimshaw, whom Mann had earlier drawn with, Mann {{controlled}} the stand-up {{and the top}} position on the floor. Towards {{the end of the}} fight, Grimshaw <b>attempted</b> <b>a</b> comeback, utilising ground-and-pound offense, though Mann was declared the winner via unanimous decision after three rounds.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo {{received}} the ball off the kickoff {{on their own}} 28-yard line. Losing eightyards on their threeplays, Buffalo once again punted the ball to Connecticut. UConn drove to the Buffalo 25-yard line and <b>attempted</b> <b>a</b> 42-yard field goal; the kick by Dave Teggart was blocked. Buffalo got the ball back {{with less than a}} minute left in the quarter and completed twopasses, moving the ball 13yards down the field before the quarter expired. The score remained in Connecticut's favor, 24–20.|$|E
50|$|Thepchaiya Un-Nooh {{missed the}} final black in <b>attempting</b> <b>a</b> maximum break against Anthony McGill {{in the fourth}} frame of their final {{qualifying}} round match.

5|$|Darejan and {{her party}} were resolutely opposed to George XII's renewed {{quest for the}} Russian protection. In 1800, one of Darejan's sons, Alexander, openly broke with his {{half-brother}} and <b>attempted</b> <b>a</b> coup {{with the help of}} his Avar and Iranian allies. The relations in the royal family hit the nadir in July 1800, when George XII forced Queen Dowager Darejan into confinement at her palace in Avlabari, prompting Darejan's sons to mobilize their loyal forces around Tbilisi.|$|E
5|$|In 1698, the Company of Scotland <b>attempted</b> <b>a</b> {{project to}} secure a trading colony on the Isthmus of Panama. Almost every Scottish {{landowner}} who had money to spare {{is said to have}} invested in the Darien scheme. Its failure bankrupted these landowners, but not the burghs. Nevertheless, the nobles' bankruptcy, along with the threat of an English invasion, played a leading role in convincing the Scots elite to back a union with England.|$|E
5|$|In the match, {{which took}} place in Bologna, Italy, San Marino had the {{kick-off}} and the ball was quickly played through the inside-right channel. England defender Stuart Pearce <b>attempted</b> <b>a</b> back-pass to goalkeeper David Seaman. Pearce's pass was under-hit and Gualtieri ran on to touch the ball past Seaman. The goal was timed at 8.3 seconds, which remains the fastest World Cup goal scored in either qualifying or the finals. England took 20 minutes to equalise and eventually finished winning the match 7–1.|$|E

5|$|On March 14, 1980, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 007, an Ilyushin Il-62, <b>attempted</b> <b>a</b> {{go-around}} {{when the}} crew experienced troubles with a gear indicator. When thrust was applied, the low pressure turbine disc in engine number 2 disintegrated because of material fatigue; {{parts of the}} disc damaged engines number 1 and 3 and severed control pushers for both horizontal and vertical stabilizers. After 26 seconds of uncontrolled descent, the aircraft crashed, killing all 87 people on board.|$|E
5|$|Piłsudski often {{clashed with}} Dmowski, at {{variance}} with the latter's vision of the Poles as the dominant nationality in renascent Poland, and irked by Dmowski's attempt to send the Blue Army to Poland through Danzig, Germany (now Gdańsk, Poland). On 5 January 1919, some of Dmowski's supporters (Marian Januszajtis-Żegota and Eustachy Sapieha) <b>attempted</b> <b>a</b> coup against Piłsudski and Prime Minister Moraczewski, but failed.|$|E
5|$|The Beauchamps {{were accused}} of trying to bribe a guard to let them escape, but this effort failed. They also tried to get a letter to Senator Beauchamp, asking for his help in escaping.

Later that day, the couple <b>attempted</b> <b>a</b> double suicide by taking large doses of laudanum, but both survived.|$|E

5|$|The demands made by {{the colonial}} {{government}} on Congolese workers during the war provoked strikes and riots from the workforce. Whites in the colony were allowed to form trade unions {{for the first time}} during the war, and their demands for better pay and working conditions were often emulated by black workers. In October 1941, white workers in the colony unsuccessfully <b>attempted</b> <b>a</b> general strike across the colony.|$|E
5|$|The first {{televised}} {{match was}} for the WWE Intercontinental Championship in which Chris Jericho defended the title against Shelton Benjamin, who won the fans' vote with 37%.

The match ended when Benjamin performed a T-Bone Suplex on Jericho to win the title.|$|E
5|$|The kick bounced out {{of bounds}} at the Clemson 44-yard line, and Virginia Tech's offense {{returned}} to the field. On the first play, Vick <b>attempted</b> <b>a</b> pass into the end zone.
