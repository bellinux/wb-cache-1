500|$|In {{the form}} of an {{extensive}} series of callbacks, Larkin returned to the studio on several different occasions over the next few months. While the audience of studio executives and filmmakers continued to increase, the amount of actresses competing for the role gradually decreased accordingly as the audition process neared completion. Larkin's final audition lasted a total of four hours, during which she read through the entire script for the first time. The animators were also provided with an opportunity to <b>animate</b> <b>to</b> Larkin's voice for the first time. The actress was finally cast several months later, by which time she had nearly forgotten she had ever auditioned. Six months into recording, however, Larkin was forced to re-audition for the role by Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, who felt that the actress' voice lacked the authority required to voice a princess. However, Clements and Musker disagreed with him, and managed to trick Katzenberg into not firing Larkin by staging a fake recording session during which they had the actress speak lower and slower in Katzenberg's presence, only to have her return to her natural voice thereafter. Larkin recorded only one scene alongside her co-stars Williams and Scott Weinger, voice of Aladdin. Apart from some rough, unfinished storyboards and drawings, Larkin did not see much of her character until the film was finally screened at the Museum of Modern Art.|$|E
60|$|By what {{accident}} {{it matters}} not, nor upon what desert, but just then, {{and in the}} midst of that hunt of obloquy which ever has pursued me with a full cry through life, I had obtained a very considerable degree of public confidence. I know well enough how equivocal a test this kind of popular opinion forms of the merit that obtained it. I am no stranger to the insecurity of its tenure. I do not boast of it. It is mentioned to show, not how highly I prize the thing, but my right to value the use I made of it. I endeavored to turn that short-lived advantage to myself into a permanent benefit to my country. Far am I from detracting from the merit of some gentlemen, out of office or in it, on that occasion. No! It is not my way to refuse a full and heaped measure of justice to the aids that I receive. I have through life been willing to give everything to others,--and to reserve nothing for myself, but the inward conscience that I had omitted no pains to discover, to <b>animate,</b> <b>to</b> discipline, to direct the abilities of the country for its service, and to place them in the best light to improve their age, or to adorn it. This conscience I have. I have never suppressed any man, never checked him for a moment in his course, by any jealousy, or by any policy. I was always ready, to the height of my means, (and they wore always infinitely below my desires,) to forward those abilities which overpowered my own. He is an ill-furnished undertaker who has no machinery but his own hands to work with. Poor in my own faculties, I ever thought myself rich in theirs. In that period of difficulty and danger, more especially, I consulted and sincerely coöperated with men of all parties who seemed disposed to the same ends, or to any main part of them. Nothing to prevent disorder was omitted: when it appeared, nothing to subdue it was left uncounselled nor unexecuted, as far as I could prevail. At the time I speak of, and having a momentary lead, so aided and so encouraged, and as a feeble instrument in a mighty hand--I do not say I saved my country; I am sure I did my country important service. There were few, indeed, that did not at that time acknowledge it,--and that time was thirteen years ago. It was but one voice, that no man in the kingdom better deserved an honorable provision should be made for him. So much for my general conduct through the whole of the portentous crisis from 1780 to 1782, and the general sense then entertained of that conduct by my country. But my character as a reformer, in the particular instances which the Duke of Bedford refers to, is so connected in principle with my opinions on the hideous changes which have since barbarized France, and, spreading thence, threaten the political and moral order of the whole world, that it seems to demand something of a more detailed discussion.|$|E

5000|$|Although Flash was {{previously}} a dominant platform for online multimedia content, it is slowly being abandoned as Adobe favors {{a transition to}} HTML5 due to inherent security flaws and significant resources required to maintain the platform.

OReilly later said that some complained that the scene was [...] "too extreme for kids' TV", but he argued that children were capable of tolerating it. OReilly found that mixing his trademark glitch style with good character animation was difficult, and presented a lot of technical hurdles. In particular, he found a scene in the end, wherein an earlier clip is superimposed above Finn and Jake to function almost as a thought bubble, to be easy to storyboard, but difficult to <b>animate.</b> <b>To</b> create the titular glitches, OReilly generated sprites inside of objects that produced random pixels which moved outwards to create colorful blotches.

5000|$|In 1928, Plane Crazy {{became the}} first entry into the Mickey Mouse series; however, it was not {{released}} because of a poor reaction from test screenings and failed to gain a distributor. The second Mickey Mouse cartoon The Gallopin Gaucho also failed to gain attention of the audience and a distributor. Disney knew what was missing: sound. Sound film had been captivating audiences since 1927 with The Jazz Singer and Walt decided that the next cartoon Steamboat Willie would have sound. Steamboat Willie {{was not the first}} sound cartoon, Max and Dave Fleischer had produced Song Car-Tunes since 1926. However, they failed to keep the sound synchronized with the animation and the main focus of the cartoons were the bouncing ball sing-a-longs. The Song Car-Tunes were not a success and some staff members doubted whether a cartoon with sound would be successful. So Disney arranged a special preview screening with the music and sound effects being played live behind stage through a microphone. The Steamboat Willie test screening was a success and managed to gain a distributor, Celebrity Pictures chief Pat Powers. However, the first attempt to synchronize the sound with the animation was a disaster with the timing being all wrong. In order to finance the second recording, Walt sold his car. This time he used a click track to keep his musicians on the beat (Disney later learned that it was easier to record the dialogue, music and sound effects first and <b>animate</b> <b>to</b> the sound). Little more than a month before Steamboat Willies premiere, Paul Terry released his sound cartoon Dinner Time; however it was not a financial success and Walt Disney described it as [...] "a bunch of racket".|$|E
5000|$|The casting of American {{actor and}} comedian Robin Williams as the Genie {{inspired}} {{the studio to}} recruit similarly talented voice actors capable of matching his pace. The filmmakers had originally envisioned Jasmine's voice as {{similar to that of}} actress Lauren Bacall. Jasmine's speaking voice is provided by American actress Linda Larkin. The role was only one of several auditions Larkin had scheduled during the same week in which she auditioned for Aladdin, and she originally underestimated the scope of the project, joking, [...] "I {{thought it was going to}} be something like Duck Tales (sic)". Initially presented with only a few pages of the screenplay, Larkin found that she was particularly drawn to Jasmine's [...] "spirit of activism", in addition to the ways in which character was both similar to and different from previous Disney heroines. Princesses Snow White, Cinderella and Aurora had been childhood favorites of the actress. Larkin's first audition was held in a Burbank, California recording studio, in which she performed solely for the film's casting director. The side used for Larkin's first audition was the scene in which Jasmine meets Aladdin in the marketplace - their first encounter. Jasmine's line [...] "It's all so magical" [...] helped convince Larkin that she was [...] "meant" [...] to voice the character. Although Larkin's voice was significantly different from what the filmmakers had originally envisioned for the character, her interpretation gradually changed their minds. [...] In the form of an extensive series of callbacks, Larkin returned to the studio on several different occasions over the next few months. While the audience of studio executives and filmmakers continued to increase, the amount of actresses competing for the role gradually decreased accordingly as the audition process neared completion. Larkin's final audition lasted a total of four hours, during which she read through the entire script for the first time.

Apart from some rough, unfinished storyboards and drawings, Larkin did not see much of her character until the film was finally screened at the Museum of Modern Art. Before discovering Larkin, Disney had been insisting on auditioning exclusively performers who were capable of singing as well as they could act. However, after Williams' recruitment, the studio relented in favor of casting [...] "strong actors" [...] instead. When Larkin first auditioned for the role, [...] "A Whole New World", Jasmine's only surviving song, had not yet been written; she admitted, [...] "there's no way I would have even auditioned ... if there had been a song from the beginning." [...] After writing Jasmine's first song, the filmmakers asked Larkin if she would be interested in recording it and providing the character's singing voice. Larkin immediately declined, joking, [...] "I do sing ... but not like a princess!" [...] Thus, Disney decided to recruit a singer who could mimic Larkin's speaking voice instead, despite the actress' fear that the studio would completely replace her with a professional singer altogether.|$|E

30|$|The recent {{perspective}} on The nature and mathematical basis for material {{stability in the}} chemical and biological worlds by Robert Pascal and Addy Pross elaborates on conceptual conundrums that hinder us from relating <b>animate</b> <b>to</b> inanimate [1]. The authors recap these theoretical problems in the perennial question, how life could have emerged from inanimate matter. Moreover, Pascal and Pross are alarmed that biology, as a discipline, has by today grown apart from physical sciences, although chemistry did become biology on this planet some 3.5 to 4 billion years ago. Hence, the logical conclusion is that all disciples must have a common conceptual basis.|$|E
30|$|The {{reason for}} the clear {{imbalance}} {{in the rate of}} animate formation compared its decay, can now be pointed out. Based on the stability kinds involved, the conversion of <b>animate</b> <b>to</b> inanimate – death – is expected to be slower than the process of animate formation leading to life. <b>Animate</b> <b>to</b> inanimate is governed by the Second Law, by the more muted directive, the one concerned with material reorganization based on probabilistic considerations, while inanimate to animate is autocatalytic and driven by the kinetic power of exponential growth. Thus once a stable DK system emerges, i.e., once a network of far-from-equilibrium metabolic reactions that is holistically replicative is firmly established, the on-going drive toward greater DKS wins out, and the Second Law directive is circumvented and marginalized. In fact an energy-gathering metabolic capability must be an intrinsic component of the DKS system [12, 13] for the Second Law requirement to be satisfied. Or put another way, once the necessary conditions for life’s emergence are met and life is established, the kinetic drive toward more life, and more efficient life, overshadows the thermodynamic directive toward death, though of course that continuing transformation is conditional on a continuing source of energy. And the environmental consequences of that kinetic imbalance is dramatic and clear to see – life is (effectively) everywhere. The cosmological implications of these simple ideas need further consideration, but the preliminary conclusion seems to be that, provided a continual source of energy is available (most likely fed by nuclear processes in suns), matter will preferentially be driven from inanimate to animate, from non-replicative to replicative, that life will invariably prevail over non-life.|$|E

30|$|In {{several recent}} papers the authors, {{together}} and separately, {{have attempted to}} address these questions, to help bridge the chemistry-biology gap, through the characterization of a unique stability kind in nature, termed dynamic kinetic stability (DKS)[4, 5, 12, 13, 16 – 19]. This stability kind, quite distinct to traditional thermodynamic stability, applies to systems able to maintain a presence over time {{through a process of}} self-replication. Thus replicative stability, whether chemical or biological, is able to lead to a distinct and separate organizational state - a kinetic state of matter, thereby offering a physicochemical framework for relating biological systems to replicative chemical ones. Through that approach several of the puzzling issues regarding the relationship of <b>animate</b> <b>to</b> inanimate appear resolvable - the continuity and underlying unity of chemical and biological evolution [4, 5, 13, 16, 17], its physicochemical characterization [12, 13], the source of life’s functional nature [20], its extraordinary and distinct kind of complexity [20], its metabolic (energy-consuming) character [12, 13, 21], to mention central ones.|$|E
