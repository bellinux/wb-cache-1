50|$|In robotics, a Remote Center Compliance, Remote Center of Compliance or RCC is a {{mechanical}} device that facilitates automated assembly by preventing peg-like objects from jamming {{when they are}} inserted into a hole with tight clearance. In a naive design without an RCC, a robot might pick up a peg with its gripper, center the peg over the hole and then push the peg along the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole.</b> If the peg is perfectly aligned and centered, it would then slide into the hole. However if the peg's alignment or centering is slightly off, the peg contacts {{one side of the}} hole first and the peg's tip experiences a lateral force. As the robot's gripper is not perfectly stiff, the peg will tend to rotate about an axis in the plane of the gripper's fingers, called the center of compliance. Such a rotation further misaligns the peg, increasing the lateral force and causing more rotation, resulting in a jam that prevents the insertion from being completed.|$|E

The baby skyrmion configuration was constructed from two Q= 1 hedgehog solutions to the baby skyrme model in (2 + 1) dimensions. The potential obstructions were created by introducing a new term into the Lagrangian which resulted in a localised inhomogeneity in the potential terms' coefficient. In the barrier system, the normal circular path was deformed as the skyrmions traversed the barrier. During the same period, it was seen that the skyrmions sped up as they went over the barrier.

40|$|NoBACKGROUND: A Full Thickness Macular Hole (FTMH) {{is often}} {{associated}} with vitreomacular traction, and this can be asymmetric with vitreomacular traction {{on one side of the}} hole but not the other. In cross-section, the elevated retinal rim around a developed FTMH is seen as a drawbridge elevation, and this drawbridge elevation may be used as a measure of morphological change. Examination of the drawbridge elevation of the retinal rim in FTMH with asymmetric vitreomacular traction may help to clarify the role of vitreomacular traction in the development of FTMH. METHOD: Cases of FTMH were identified with an initial OCT scan showing vitreomacular traction on one side of the hole only and that had a follow-up OCT scan showing progression of the hole. A tangent to the retinal surface at a distance of 700 microns from the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> was used as a marker of the drawbridge elevation of the retinal rim around the macular hole. Comparisons of the drawbridge elevation and change in drawbridge elevation between the sides with and without initial vitreomacular traction were made.

40|$|Spin {{parameters}} of stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries {{are currently being}} estimated by fitting the X-ray continuum spectra of their accretion disk emission. For this method, {{it is necessary to}} know the inclination of the X-ray-producing inner region of the disk. Since the inner disk is expected to be oriented perpendicular to the spin <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> the usual practice is to assume that the black hole spin is aligned with the orbital angular momentum vector of the binary, and to estimate the inclination of the latter from ellipsoidal modulations in the light curve of the secondary star. We show that the inclination of the disk can be inferred directly if we have both spectral and polarization information on the disk radiation. The predicted degree of polarization varies from 0 % to 5 % as the disk inclination changes from face-on to edge-on. With current X-ray polarimetric techniques the polarization degree of a typical bright X-ray binary could be measured to an accuracy of 0. 1 % by observing the source for about 10 days. Such a measurement would constrain the disk inclination to within a degree or two and would significantly improve the reliability of black hole spin estimates. In addition, it would provide new information on the tilt between the black hole spin axis and the orbital rotation axis of the binary, which would constrain any velocity kicks experienced by stellar-mass black holes during their formation.

It was {{presented}} at the 28 th Congress of the International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences, 23 - 28 September 2012, Brisbane, Australia. Development of a technique to predict the effects of simulated battle damage on the aerodynamics of a three dimensional wing is described. A methodology for converting two dimensional lift, drag and pitching moment data to three dimensional values is developed. To test this methodology, wind tunnel testing was carried out on a three dimensional half model of the NASA LS(1) - 0417 MOD aerofoil, with simulated battle damage. The effective aspect ratio of the model was 6. A circular hole with a diameter of 20 % of wing chord was used to simulate gunfiretype battle damage. To model different attack directions the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> was inclined along the chord and span. Three spanwise locations for the damage were tested. Testing was undertaken at a Reynolds Number of 1, 000, 000. Compared to an undamaged wing, the addition of damage caused an increase in drag, a decrease in lift and a more negative pitching moment. The effects increased with incidence and changed with hole orientation. These effects were reduced as the damage was moved towards the wing tip. Results from the predictive technique were compared with those from half model testing. The predicted lift loss was seen to be in close agreement with wind tunnel results, but the drag increase was under predicted. The biggest errors in the prediction occurred for the pitching moment, although the relatively low aspect ratio is believed to have an adverse effect on the comparison...|$|E

40|$|Propagation of {{transient}} pressure {{waves in}} nonhomogeneous viscoelastic media with a cylindrical hole of circular cross section is investigated by employing <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> propagating surfaces <b>of</b> discontinuities. <b>The</b> non-homogeneities {{are assumed to}} depend on the radial distance from <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cylindrical <b>hole.</b> <b>The</b> solutions for the normal stress components and the radial particle velocity are expressed as Taylor series expansions about <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> arrival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wave front. Two types of boundary conditions are considered. <b>The</b> wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cylindrical <b>hole</b> is either subjected to uniform pressure or to uniform radial particle velocity both of which have arbitrary dependence on time. Then the solutions are reduced to <b>the</b> special case <b>of</b> homogeneous viscoelastic media. Numerical computations are carried out for a homogeneous standard linear solid and for a uniform pressure with a step distribution in time applied at <b>the</b> wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole.</b> These numerical results are compared with those obtained previously by other investigators who have employed <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> characteristics...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} method for {{measuring}} <b>the</b> black <b>hole</b> charge by imaging a black hole shadow in a galactic center by future interferometers. Even when <b>the</b> black <b>hole</b> is uncharged, {{it is possible to}} confirm the charge neutrality by this method. We first derive <b>the</b> analytic formulae <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black <b>hole</b> shadow in an optically thin medium around a charged spinning black hole, and then investigate how contours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black <b>hole</b> shadow depend on the spin and <b>the</b> charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black <b>hole</b> for several inclination angles between <b>the</b> rotation <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black <b>hole</b> and <b>the</b> observer. This method only assumes stationary black hole and general relativity. By fitting <b>the</b> formula <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadow to <b>the</b> observed image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadow, in addition to <b>the</b> black <b>hole</b> charge, one can also determine <b>the</b> black <b>hole</b> spin and <b>the</b> inclination angle without any degeneracy among the charge, the spin, and the inclination angle unless the inclination angle is null.

40|$|Accretion discs around {{black holes}} in X-ray binary stars are warped if <b>the</b> spin <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black <b>hole</b> is not {{perpendicular}} to the binary orbital plane. They can also become eccentric through an instability involving a resonance with the binary orbit. Depending on <b>the</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disc and <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> dissipative processes, these global deformations {{may be able to}} propagate into <b>the</b> innermost part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disc in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> stationary bending or density waves. We describe the solutions in the linear regime and discuss the conditions under which a warp or eccentricity is likely to produce significant activity in the inner region, which may include <b>the</b> excitation <b>of</b> quasi-periodic oscillations.
