5|$|Acquisition {{of second}} and {{additional}} languages can come <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>age,</b> through exposure {{in daily life}} or courses. Children learning a second language {{are more likely to}} achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 about 3.3 {{million cases}} of self-harm occurred. Self-harm is most common {{between the ages}} of 12 and 24. Self-harm in {{childhood}} is relatively rare but the rate has been increasing since the 1980s. However, self-harm behaviour can occur <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>age,</b> including in the elderly population. The risk of serious injury and suicide is higher in older people who self-harm. Self-harm is not limited to humans. Captive animals, such as birds and monkeys, are also known to participate in self-harming behaviour.|$|E

50|$|The {{condition}} affects 0.1%-0.2% of the population, and {{occurs in}} {{both males and}} females. Alopecia areata occurs in people who are otherwise healthy and have no other skin disorders. Initial presentation most commonly occurs in the late teenage years, early childhood, or young adulthood, but can happen <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>ages.</b> Patients also {{tend to have a}} slightly higher incidence of conditions related to the immune system, such as asthma, allergies, atopic dermatitis, and hypothyroidism.|$|R

5|$|Symptoms of Huntington's disease most {{commonly}} become noticeable {{between the ages}} of 35 and 44years, but they can begin <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>age</b> from infancy to old age. In the early stages, there are subtle changes in personality, cognition, and physical skills. The physical symptoms are usually the first to be noticed, as cognitive and behavioral symptoms are generally not severe enough to be recognized on their own at the earlier stages. Almost everyone with Huntington's disease eventually exhibits similar physical symptoms, but the onset, progression and extent of cognitive and behavioral symptoms vary significantly between individuals.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} psoriasis; however, various {{treatments}} can help control the symptoms. These treatments include steroid creams, vitamin D3 cream, ultraviolet light and immune system suppressing medications, such as methotrexate. About 75 percent of cases can be managed with creams alone. The disease affects two to four percent of the population. Men and women are affected with equal frequency. The disease may begin <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>age,</b> but typically starts in adulthood. Psoriasis is {{associated with an increased}} risk of psoriatic arthritis, lymphomas, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease and depression. Psoriatic arthritis affects up to 30 percent of individuals with psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's disease (HD), {{also known}} as Huntington's chorea, is an {{inherited}} disorder that results in death of brain cells. The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities. A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent. Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk. Mental abilities generally decline into dementia. The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age, but can start <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>age.</b> The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation. About 8% of cases start {{before the age of}} 20 years and typically present with symptoms more similar to Parkinson's disease. People with HD often underestimate the degree of their problems.|$|E

5|$|Toothache {{may occur}} <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>age,</b> in any gender {{and in any}} {{geographic}} region. Diagnosing and relieving toothache {{is considered one of}} the main responsibilities of dentists. Irreversible pulpitis is thought to be the most common reason that people seek emergency dental treatment. Since dental caries associated with pulpitis is the most common cause, toothache is more common in populations that are at higher risk of dental caries. The prevalence of caries in a population is dependent upon factors such as diet (refined sugars), socioeconomic status, and exposure to fluoride (such as areas without water fluoridation). In the United States, an estimated 12% of the general population reported that they suffered from toothache at some point in the six months before questioning. Individuals aged 18–34 reported much higher experience of toothache than those aged 75 or over. In a survey of Australian schoolchildren, 12% had experienced toothache before the age of five, and 32% by the age of 12. Dental trauma is extremely common and tends to occur more often in children than adults.|$|E

40|$|Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an {{acquired}} autoimmune disease affecting synaptic transmission via the neuromuscular junction mainly {{due to the}} presence of auto-antibodies targeting acetylcholine receptors. Ocular or generalized MG is clinically diagnosed when the extra-ocular muscles or other muscle groups beyond the extra-ocular muscles are involved. MG occurs in both sexes <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>ages</b> from all races but shows a wide variability in incidence and prevalence. Differences in clinical phenotypes of MG patients between West and East countries have been observed.

40|$|The paper supposes, {{consistent}} with law, that single or married Social Security beneficiaries view an initiation or postponement decision {{in terms of}} a sequential decision process rather than {{in terms of a}} single evaluation made at or before the normal retirement age. The question asked at each age, according to the sequential approach introduced in this paper, is not whether to initiate now or postpone until some time in the distant future, but whether to initiate now or postpone for just one year. This paper shows that the opportunity rate of return (or minimum investment yield) required to justify initiation <b>at</b> <b>any</b> eligible <b>age</b> (62 through 69), varies from one eligible retirement age to the next within any cohort group, and <b>at</b> <b>any</b> eligible <b>age</b> across cohort groups. Moreover, while members of a particular cohort group might find it advantageous to initiate benefits at a particular age, say at age 62, early retirement might not be advantageous a year later.
