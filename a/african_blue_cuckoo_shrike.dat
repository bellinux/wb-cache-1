40|$|Genetic {{data are}} {{increasingly}} recognized for their utility in conservation programs. However, many endangered species belong to {{families that have}} been understudied. Due to the urgency of their conservation status {{it is important to}} quickly identify polymorphic microsatellite loci from available resources. We show for the Re´union <b>Cuckoo</b> <b>shrike</b> Coracina newtoni, that this strategy can be very useful. Using 110 passerine microsatellite primer sets we identified eighteen polymorphic loci and tested them in 25 C. newtoni individuals. Following a Bonferroni correction one pair of loci displayed linkage disequilibriu...|$|R

50|$|<b>African</b> <b>Blues</b> is a {{world music}} benefit {{compilation}} album originally released in 1998, with proceeds going to Voluntary Service Overseas. Part of the World Music Network Rough Guides series, the release features <b>African</b> <b>blues</b> (a genre which is not simply an African re-interpretation of the American style, but carrying on traditions that were also exported to the Americas—see Origins of the blues). The compilation was produced and coordinated by Phil Stanton & Sandra Alayón-Stanton, co-founders of the World Music Network. Though they are named differently (the Rough Guide designation being omitted in this release and only found in the catalogue number, common practice for the label's charity releases), 2007's The Rough Guide to <b>African</b> <b>Blues</b> is sometimes considered this album's second edition.|$|R

50|$|Like other allodapines, bees of this genus raise {{young in}} a nest burrow. Burrows are dug in plants, such as <b>African</b> <b>blue</b> basil (Ocimum kilimandscharicum) and lantana (Lantana camara).|$|R
5000|$|The {{song of the}} <b>African</b> <b>blue</b> flycatcher is {{a series}} of slow, rather random and tuneless {{sibilant}} notes strung together in no particular order. Call is a quiet [...] "tsip".|$|R
50|$|Tirumala petiverana, the <b>blue</b> monarch, <b>African</b> <b>blue</b> tiger or dappled monarch, is a {{butterfly}} of the Nymphalidae family. It {{is found in}} tropical Africa. The habitat consists of Afromontane, lowland and riverine forests.|$|R
50|$|Research {{published}} in 2007 found that <b>African</b> <b>blue</b> tits {{on the eastern}} Canary Islands of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote are indistinguishable from those in North Africa and so the subspecies degener {{should be regarded as}} a synonym of ultramarinus.|$|R
50|$|<b>African</b> <b>blue</b> basil (Ocimum kilimandscharicum × basilicum 'Dark Opal') {{is one of}} a few {{types of}} basil that are perennial. It is a sterile hybrid of two other breeds of basil, unable to produce seeds of its own, and is {{propagated}} by cuttings.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>blue</b> tit (Cyanistes teneriffae) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Paridae. It is found in {{northern}} Africa and the Canary Islands. Its natural habitat is temperate forests. This species and the Eurasian blue tit were formerly considered conspecific.|$|R
50|$|Two {{subspecies}} of the <b>African</b> <b>blue</b> flycatcher {{are currently}} recognised. Elminia longicauda longicauda (Swainson, 1838) which {{is found in}} the western part of its range as far east as Nigeria, and the paler Elminia longicauda teresita Antinori, 1864 in the west and the south.|$|R
50|$|Salvia aurita (<b>African</b> <b>blue</b> sage) is a {{herbaceous}} perennial shrub {{native to}} South Africa (the Cape Provinces, KwaZulu-Natal and the Northern Provinces) and Swaziland. It is found growing on streambanks. It grows to 1.2 m tall, with numerous blue, white, and lilac flowers growing in whorls on short racemes.|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves of}} <b>African</b> <b>blue</b> basil start out purple when young, only growing green as the given leaf grows {{to its full}} size, and even then {{retaining}} purple veins. Based on other purple basils, the color is from anthocyanins, especially cyanidin-3-(di-p-coumarylglucoside)-5-glucoside, but also other cyanidin-based and peonidin-based compounds.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>African</b> <b>blue</b> flycatcher {{is thought}} to form a {{superspecies}} with the white-tailed blue flycatcher and these species the two {{have been placed in}} a separate genus Errannornis, but the differences between this species pair and the other species classified in Elminia are considered insufficient to merit generic separation.|$|R
