2500|$|To {{support this}} hypothesis, Reuben Lasker cited the {{disconnect}} between spawning stock biomass and {{the recruitment of}} numerous fish species. One explanation of this disconnect suggests larval recruitment is influenced by spatial and temporal patterns of their food, like phytoplankton or zooplankton, which can be greatly affected by ocean currents and mixing. In his publication Marine fish larvae: Morphology, ecology, and relation to fisheries (1981), he points out, for example, the Peruvian anchovy fishery collapse that resulted from a dramatic decrease in population size during the early 1970s. [...] Officials and researchers from the Peruvian government and United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization submitted that the causal factors were a combination of strong fishing pressure and weak year classes that resulted in insufficient reproduction and recruitment to support the fishery. This explanation seemed to explain the diminished population trends of similar species from other regions, including the Pacific and Japanese sardines and the <b>Atlanto-Scandian</b> <b>herring.</b>|$|E

The results of the international surveys clearly show that the ocean climate was relatively mild during 1950 - 1964. On the other hand the years 1965 - 1969 were very cold {{and the nature of the}} East Icelandic Current changed dramatically. During the mild period the herring were a ble to cross the cold tongue while during the cold period the migration pattern of the herring as well as the feeding area shifted from north of Iceland to the Bear Island area.

40|$|The European Union (EU) and Faroe Islands, a small self-governing {{archipelago}} {{under the}} sovereignty of Denmark, both belong to the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC). NEAFC is a regional fisheries management organisation (RFMO) {{which is responsible for}} the management of, inter alia, <b>Atlanto-Scandian</b> <b>herring.</b> NEAFC parties have a long-term management plan in place for <b>Atlanto-Scandian</b> <b>herring.</b> Based on recommendations from the International Council for the Exploration of Seas (ICES) the parties set a total allowable catch (TAC) for the herring and divide this among the contracting parties each year. At the 2012 consultations between the NEAFC parties the Faroe Islands requested a larger share of the TAC. The Faroe Islands left the consultations after the other parties repeatedly refused this request. It was granted a share of the TAC by the other four states in its absence. It then set its own catch quota far above this allocated share. In response the EU put in place port state measures to prevent <b>Atlanto-Scandian</b> <b>herring</b> from entering the EU. This included an import ban and a ban on the use of EU ports by Faroese vessels. The EU took this action under Council Regulation (EC) No. 1026 / 2012 (Shared Stocks Regulation) which allows measures to be imposed against third countries that allow non-sustainable fishing of common or straddling stocks. This includes measures taken against RFMO partners for non-compliance with RMFO laws, as RFMOs are generally set up to conserve straddling fish stocks. This Regulation was promulgated in line with a number of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) such as UNCLOS and the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA). The Faroe Islands challenged the Shared Stocks Regulation and the specific Implementing Regulation imposing the port state measures in both the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and a Tribunal constituted under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). However the matter was settled before either of these tribunals could hear the case. The dissertation interrogates whether the EU Regulations are consistent with WTO law, specifically the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), using the facts of the <b>Atlanto-Scandian</b> <b>herring</b> dispute. Chapter I sets out the background to the dispute, and explains the concepts of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, and port state measures. Chapters II and III of the dissertation consider the consistency of the EU Regulations with the GATT. Chapter II finds that the EU Regulations contravene one or more of Articles I, V and XI of the GATT (the substantive provisions). Chapter III considers whether these measures, having contravened one of the GATT substantive provisions, may be justified under Article XX of the GATT (the exceptions provision). Chapter III concludes that, although well-crafted, the EU Regulations may still not be justifiable under the Article XX Chapeau in the particular circumstances of the herring dispute, based on principles in previous WTO cases. Chapter IV considers the relationship between multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) relevant to IUU fishing and WTO agreements, to determine whether the EU Regulations could be considered GATT-consistent by reference to these MEAs or whether the MEAs could override WTO law.

40|$|Understanding and {{modelling}} {{the environmental}} control of fish recruitment {{has been a}} central question in fish population ecology for the last century. Most environment–recruitment models have primarily been developed to model mean recruitment using conventional regression techniques which assume that all environmental parameters are included and that the residual unexplained variability is unstructured. However, the complexity of environmental controls and the empirical evidence that many relationships have failed when retested suggest that these assumptions are generally not met. Most environmental controls may be considered as limiting factors to recruitment and act in interaction with other factors (often not measured or not known). We used quantile regression modelling, which is specifically designed to model limiting relationships, to reanalyse environment–recruitment relationships that have been published for 4 fish stocks: (1) Northeast Arctic cod (Barents Sea), (2) <b>Atlanto-Scandian</b> <b>herring,</b> (3) Bay of Biscay anchovy and (4) Pacific sardine. The method was adapted to the specific case of autocorrelated time series, a common feature of most environmental signals. The results from quantile regression were not straightforward extensions of conventional regressions. For Northeast Arctic cod and Pacific sardine, the original relationships with temperature {{were not statistically significant}} in the quantile model. For <b>Atlanto-Scandian</b> <b>herring</b> the relationship was confirmed and temperature clearly appeared as a limiting factor to recruitment. The published relationship for the Bay of Biscay anchovy with upwelling was not confirmed, but the previously undetected relationship with river runoff was established. In this specific case, it was only by using a quantile model that the relationship could be detected as statistically significant. These results confirm the ability of quantile regression models to provide robust interpretation of environment–recruitment relationships and to produce environmentally based advance warning when recruitment is expected to be low...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirically based, game-theoretic {{model of the}} exploitation of the Norwegian spring-spawning herring stock, {{also known as the}} <b>Atlanto-Scandian</b> <b>herring</b> stock. The model involves five exploiters; Norway, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the EU, and Russia and an explicit, stochastic migratory behavior of the stock. Under these conditions Markov Perfect (Nash) equilibrium game strategies are calculated and compared to the jointly optimal exploitation pattern. Not surprisingly, {{it turns out that the}} solution to the competitive game is hugely inefficient, leading very quickly to the virtual exhaustion of the resource. The scope for cooperative agreements involving the calculation of Shapley values is investigated. Although the grand coalition of all players maximizes overall benefits, such a coalition can hardly be stable over time unless side payments are possible.

40|$|Pelagic {{fish populations}} {{can and do}} undergo precipitous and catas-trophic {{recruitment}} failures. Peru suffered a massive collapse of its fishery for anchoveta, EnPaulis ringens (Valdivia, 19781, resulting in a reduced catch from 1971 to 1973, Le., from 12 million to 2 million tons, an economic disaster. Experts called in by the Food and Ae$culture Organization of the United Nations {{and the government of}} Peru noted that the decline in the population of the Peruvian anchoveta had much in common with similar declines of other clupeoid species, e. g., the <b>Atlanto-Scandian</b> <b>herring,</b> the Pa-cific sardine, the Hokkaido herring, and the Japanese sardine (Murphy, 1974). They concluded that heavy fishing on a parent stock after the appear-ance of several poor year classes is sufficient to reduce the stock’s reprcduc-tive potential to a point where it can no longer produce enough recruits for the fishery. However, a very small population size did not prevent the recent resur-gence in the fishery for the Japanese sardine, Sardinops rmlanostkta. This i...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} we study a three- eet bioeconomic {{model of the}} Norwegian {{spring-spawning}} (or <b>Atlanto-Scandian)</b> <b>herring</b> shery. The biological model is described by a discrete time age structured model. The economic model is based on constant price and log-linear costs. We study the optimal mix between the three eets {{from the viewpoint of}} a single exploiter of the herring stock. In addition, we study several adaptive strategies of the eets. We show that adaptive strategies based on spawning-stock biomass (SSB) produce largest economic rents for the shery. Further, we show that open access leads to stock extinction and zero pro ts after a period of 60 years.

40|$|From a trawl {{survey in}} a fjord system in {{northern}} Norway, {{it has been}} possible to separate catches of herring into two distinct groups characterized by different number of vertebrae (VS). Low- vertebral herring (VS = 52 - 55) belong to a local stock of spring-spawning fjord stock called the Balsfjord herring. High-vertebral herring (VS = 56 - 60) belong to an immigrating population of Atlanto- Scandian herring spawned off the Norwegian coast. The separation between the stocks was verified by genetic analysis of herring samples using enzyme electrophoresis. The Balsfjord -herring {{is characterized by a}} very high frequency (0. 93) of a rare allele (designated 110) at the LDH- 2 locus which is expressed in white muscle tissue. In comparison, this allele is usually not found (frequency < 0. 01) in samples of <b>Atlanto-Scandian</b> <b>herring.</b> The discrimination between the two stocks in Balsfjord was, however, evident from the biological data obtained (age distribution, VS, mean length and length distributions) as well as the genetic characters investigated. In addition, the Balsfjord herring, especially at mature stage, seem to be distributed at 60 - 200 m depth and was caught by using bottom trawl. The Atlanto- Scandian herring, mainly 2 or 3 years old, was found in the upper water layer (0 - 60 m). The genetic data indicate very limited or no gene flow between the two herring stocks in Balsfjord. This fjord system, therefore, offers unique possibility to study interaction and isolating mechanisms with regards to marine fish stocks...|$|E
40|$|The Barents Sea capelin {{is a major}} forage {{species for}} many apex predators, for example, fish. marine mammals, sea birds, and man. The fishery for Barents Sea capelin {{increased}} exponentially in the early 1970 s with {{the demise of the}} <b>Atlanto-Scandian</b> <b>herring</b> fishery along the Norwegian coast. The collapse of the herring spawning-stock resulted in the disappearance of young herring from the southern Barents Sea and the diet of the larger (ca. 3 + ages), piscivorous cod. Since then the only major dietary alternative for these larger cod has been capelin. The over-all trend in the biomass of the Barents Sea cod, however, has been one of decline since the late 1940 s. As there was a marked decrease in the biomass of the 3 + ages of cod from ca. 3 106 tonnes to ca. 1 106 tonnes from 1974 to 1983, this would have simultaneously caused a great reduction in the predation pressure from cod on the capelin. The Barents Sea capelin is an r-strategist. Its weight-at-age is inversely related to population size. and thus the number of cohorts and subsequently age-at-maturity are positively related to population size. Principal components analysis (PCA) indicates that the biomass of 2 + ages of capelin and population characteristics already exhibited a declining trend from about 1975, despite a declining cod stock. Coupling of independent Russian and Norwegian data clearly shows that the percentage occurrence of prawns in the stomach of 3 + cod increased disproportionately from the mid- 1970 s despite a decrease in the cod biomass...|$|E

During {{the past}} three decades {{considerable}} changes have taken place within the Icelandic pelagic industry which, previously considered rather fragmented, is now a highly concentrated vertically integrated industry due to considerable consolidations of quotas. During this period, changes in the ecosystem around Iceland have also brought valuable pelagic species such as <b>Atlanto-Scandian</b> <b>herring</b> and Atlantic mackerel to the EEZ, while other species such as capelin have declined. Part of the concentration within the pelagic sector can be attributed to changes in the ITQ management system and company adjustments to laws and regulations.   Another aspect {{can be attributed to the}} entrance of valuable species into the Icelandic EEZ and decreasing quotas of fishmeal oriented species. Finally technology changes have increased production efficiency in processing and fisheries. All this has altered the Icelandic pelagic industry in three ways: Firstly, processing for human consumption has increased with additional species and advances in processing technology.   Secondly, raw material for the fishmeal industry has declined parallel with lower capelin quotas.   Thirdly, a number of processing utilities and vessels have been scrapped, affecting employment in many fishing villages...|$|E
40|$|The herring {{spawning}} in the West Fjord late March/April 1963 {{were located}} {{during the following}} summer off the Røst Bank. The fishermen lost contact with this herring {{in the middle of}} August, but it was again discovered late September 60 miles north of Torsvåg. The herring concentrated in the Deep of Iiigøy in October anel remained there til the end of January 1964. It immigrated the West Fjord for spawning by the end of February and the beginning of March. The total catch in the West Fjord was about 1 500 000 hl which amounts to half of the total output of the winter herring fisheries. In the summer of 1964 a mixture of fat herring and mature herring was located 100 - 200 miles to the northwest of Andenes, where USSR drifters made good catches till the end of September. The map Fig. 1 shows the area covered by R/V «Johan Hjort» 23. October - 2. November, the surface temperature, the hydrographical section taken during the cruise, and the herring schools located. The herring were found at a depth of more than 200 m in a temperature of about 4 C degrees. It is unlikely that the herring will invade the coast before the spawning migration, most likely in February 1965. So far the lierring have behaved according to my hypothesis given during the Herring Symposium of ICES in 1961 (Devold, F. 1963) : this herring do not migrate to the Polar Front after spawning in Norwegian coastal waters. It remains during the feeding period off Northern Norway. But it is already clear that a single autumn in this area do not push the spawning forwards {{to such a degree that}} it have to go to the Skagerack for spawning.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{economic}} effects {{of the collapse of}} the Atlanto-Scandian and the North Sea herring stocks on the Norwegian fisheries. In the late 1950 s the Norwegian winter herring fishery failed, and in the 1960 s the entire stock of the <b>Atlanto-Scandian</b> <b>herring</b> collapsed. A few years later the North Sea herring stock suffered the same fate. Prior to these events, the herring fishery was the single most important fishery in Norway in terms of employment and landings. It was particularly important in western Norway, not least in the county of Hordaland, on which this paper focuses in particular. The immediate consequence of the collapse of the herring stocks was a severe decline in income and raw material for the processing industry. These difficulties were, however, overcome relatively quickly. The fishing fleet found substitute stocks, such as mackerel and capelin. The government took some measures for immediate employment relief, but over time redundant fishermen were absorbed into other industries, not least the emerging petroleum and fish farming industries. The time of the herring collapse was also a time of transition to a greater specialization in the labour market. Earlier, people had combined fishing with other occupations (farming, carpentry, etc.), but specialization on a single occupation became more and more common. This is likely to have made the adjustment to the herring collapse easier. The demise of the herring stocks in the 1960 s and 70 s is generally believed to have been the result of overfishing, which in turn was caused by major technological leaps (the power block, the asdic) enabling the fishing fleet to increase its catches by an order of magnitude. At the time there was no framework in place for international fisheries management to limit catches to what the fish stocks could bear. The herring collapses did, however, coincide with a change in ocean climate, so the causal relationship may have been more complicated. The technological changes which contributed to the herring collapse also made it easier to adjust to this event; the bigger and more powerful boats could be directed to fish stocks previously only lightly exploited due to distance and other factors making them less easily accessible...|$|E
