40|$|This paper evaluates (1) {{whether the}} {{exogenous}} component of financial intermediary development influences {{economic growth and}} (2) whether cross-country differences in legal <b>and</b> <b>accounting</b> systems (e. g., creditor rights, contract enforcement, <b>and</b> <b>accounting</b> standards) explain differences {{in the level of}} financial development. Using both traditional cross-section, instrumental variable procedures and recent dynamic panel techniques, we find that the exogenous component of financial intermediary development is positively associated with economic growth. Also, the data show that cross-country differences in legal <b>and</b> <b>accounting</b> systems help account for differences in financial development. Together, these findings suggest that legal <b>and</b> <b>accounting</b> reforms that strengthen creditor rights, contract enforcement, <b>and</b> <b>accounting</b> practices can boost financial development and accelerate economic growth. ...|$|R

His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life <b>and</b> <b>accounts</b> of historical events. Similar to his other works, What's So Amazing About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a judgmental church, a theme Yancey previously explored in The Jesus I Never Knew and later returned to in Reaching for the Invisible God and Soul Survivor.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} an incurable {{neurodegenerative}} disease which most often affects the elderly <b>and</b> <b>accounts</b> {{for more than}} half of all cases of dementia. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a protein misfolding disease. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic aggregations of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, caused by Aβ misfolding and clumping together with other Aβ peptides. These Aβ aggregates then grow into significantly larger senile plaques, a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of Aβ aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.|$|E

5|$|Current glaciers cover an area 1,375 {{square miles}} (3,560km2) <b>and</b> <b>accounts</b> for 27% of the Park area. Up {{until the early}} 1700s the area was a large single glacier of solid ice. It has since retreated and evolved into the largest {{protected}} water area park in the world. Glacier Bay, on the Gulf of Alaska, {{was known as the}} Grand Pacific Glacier, about 4,000 feet (1,200 m) thick and around 20 miles (32km) in width. Over the last 200 years the glaciers have retreated, exposing 65 miles (105km) of ocean, and in this process left 20 separate other glaciers in its trail. In 1890, the name “Glacier Bay” as such was given to the bay by Captain Lester A. Beardslee of the U.S. Navy. It was first proclaimed a U.S. National Monument on February 25, 1925, by President Calvin Coolidge.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to studies <b>and</b> <b>accounts</b> {{that showed the}} bad condition of the lake, the state restored the fish population of the lake in 1978. In 1985, a study recommended ecological restoration {{of the lake and}} forest, which had been overtaken by invasive species introduced during highway construction. Since then, there have been seven plans for restoring natural elements of the park, as well as three plans for park restoration. Gradual improvements began taking place in the late 1980s, including the addition of new pathways, signage, and security, as well as the restoration of playgrounds and other recreational facilities. In January 1988, NYC Parks conducted a study to determine the specific elements of the park that needed restoration. Highway structures were also reconfigured to clean runoff from these structures. An excavation in the 1990s yielded over 2,500 artifacts.|$|E
