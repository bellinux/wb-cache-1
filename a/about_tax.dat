25|$|The firm helped {{multinational}} companies obtain 548 legal tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010. The rulings provide written {{assurance that}} companies’ tax-saving {{plans will be}} seen favorably by the Luxembourg authorities. The companies saved {{billions of dollars in}} taxes with these arrangements. Some firms paid less than one percent tax on the profits they shifted to Luxembourg. Employees or former employees of PwC provided documentation of the rulings to journalists. PwC UK’s head of tax was before the UK's public accounts committee and was questioned about lying regarding the marketing of these tax avoidance schemes. He told the committee the financing, investments and tax structure is legal and well-known to the British government. “If you want to change the Lux tax regime, the politicians could change the Lux tax regime.” The disclosures attracted international attention and comment <b>about</b> <b>tax</b> avoidance schemes in Luxembourg and other tax havens. The revelations later led to a series of EU-wide measures aimed at regulating tax avoidance schemes and tax probes into several EU companies. PwC initiated charges against the two whistleblowers that revealed the LuxLeaks tax controversy. In March 2017 a Luxembourg appeals court upheld their convictions, but with reduced sentences.|$|E

25|$|For the 1992 general election, the Daily Mirror {{continued}} to support Labour, still led by Neil Kinnock.

The election was won by the Tories, although Labour managed to significantly cut the Tory majority to 21 seats compared to the triple-digit figure of the previous two elections, {{which led to a}} difficult term for Major. The outcome of this election had been far less predictable than any of the previous three elections, as opinion polls over the previous three years had shown both parties in the lead, although any Labour lead in the polls had been relatively narrow since the Conservative government's change of leader from Thatcher to Major in November 1990, in spite of the onset of a recession in 1990 which had pushed unemployment up again after several years of decline. Labour's credibility was helped by plans including extra NHS funding and moving away from firm commitments on re-nationalisation to reverse the Conservative policy of privatisation, but its decision to be up-front <b>about</b> <b>tax</b> increases was seen as a key factor in its failure to win.|$|E

2500|$|Taxes {{are most}} often levied as a percentage, called the tax rate. An {{important}} distinction when talking <b>about</b> <b>tax</b> rates is {{to distinguish between the}} marginal rate and the effective tax rate. The effective rate is the total tax paid divided by the total amount the tax is paid on, while the marginal rate is the rate paid on the next dollar of income earned. For example, if income is taxed on a formula of 5% from $0 up to $50,000, 10% from $50,000 to $100,000, and 15% over $100,000, a [...] with income of $175,000 would pay a total of $18,750 in taxes.|$|E

About half of the respondents demand more progressive tax structures, and a smaller group of individuals is highly critical <b>about</b> the <b>tax</b> level in general. Differences in these opinions are explained by factors such as household income, political affiliation, social trust and education. People with low social trust, who do not vote, or are right wing affiliated, criticise the level of all taxes.
