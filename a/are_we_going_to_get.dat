There was no evidence to identify the movement, {{or whether it was}} related to the fire. [...] The stuck microphone was part of a problem with the communications loop connecting the crew, the Operations and Checkout Building, and the Complex 34 blockhouse control room. The poor communications led Grissom to remark: [...] "How <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the Moon if we can't talk between two or three buildings?" [...] The simulated countdown was held again at 5:40pm while attempts were made to troubleshoot the communications problem. All countdown functions up to the simulated internal power transfer had been successfully completed by 6:20pm, but at 6:30 the count remained on hold at T minus 10 minutes.|$|E
500|$|When Swift {{was first}} signed to Big Machine Records, {{it was a}} new and {{extremely}} small record label, the smallest in Nashville, Tennessee, that consisted of approximately twelve employees and her as the only signed artist. At some point, Swift realized that it would be more difficult for her to achieve success through a small label, than in a larger label, constricting their contacts and making it nearly impossible to embark on concert tours and have presenter or performer slots on award shows. In addition, as the only signed artist, she could not ask for favors and only had herself to encourage the hope that scenarios would eventually change. Swift described the scenario as an [...] "uphill climb" [...] and said, [...] "There was this moment where I sat there and was like, ‘When <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a fighting chance? We’re the smallest record label in Nashville, but we want this really bad.’" [...] After reassuring to herself that it would be different in the future, she wrote the beginning of [...] "Change". She let the track sit for a while, waiting for a remarkable event to trigger its completion. She then completed the track the day after she won the Horizon Award at the 2007 Country Music Association Awards and saw Scott Borchetta, the president of Big Machine Records, crying. [...] "That’s when I finished , because I knew I couldn’t finish it until something like that happened. It was absolutely the most amazing night of my life, getting to see the emotion {{of all the people who}} worked so hard for me." ...|$|E

2500|$|With Hustle greenlit for filming, the {{production}} team began searching for actors to play both {{the main characters}} and the marks for each episode. The process was initially quite difficult; Crawford described his [...] "immediate thought [...] 'this is so good, how the hell <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a cast {{to live up to}} these characters?' ... Tony had created incredibly strong characters, each with their own particular style and panache, but they also had to form a believable, if unusual, 'family' unit". Robert Vaughn, the Academy Award-nominated star of The Man from U.N.C.L.E., was soon suggested as a natural choice to play Albert Stroller, the elderly 'roper' responsible for ensnaring potential marks. After meeting Vaughn over lunch, Crawford [...] " [...] straight away that he could bring a whole new dimension to the part of Albert". Vaughn was immediately offered the role, and asked to begin filming the following day.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the Yom Kippur War on October 6, 1973, Sharon was called back to active duty along with his {{assigned}} reserve armored division. On his farm, before he left for the front line, the Reserve Commander, Zeev Amit, said to him, [...] "How <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of this?" [...] Sharon replied, [...] "You don't know? We will cross the Suez Canal and the war will end over there." [...] Sharon arrived at the front, to participate in his fourth war, in a civilian car. His forces did not engage the Egyptian Army immediately, despite his requests. Under cover of darkness, Sharon's forces moved to a point on the Suez Canal that had been prepared before the war. In a move that again thwarted the commands of his superiors, Sharon's division crossed the Suez, effectively winning the war for Israel. He then headed north towards Ismailia, intent on cutting the Egyptian second army's supply lines, but his division was halted south of the Fresh Water Canal.|$|E
