5|$|After his discharge, Robinson briefly {{returned}} to his old football club, the Los Angeles Bulldogs. Robinson then accepted an offer from his old friend and pastor Rev. Karl Downs to be the athletic director <b>at</b> <b>Sam</b> Huston College in Austin, then of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. The job included coaching the school's basketball team for the 1944–45 season. As it was a fledgling program, few students tried out for the basketball team, and Robinson even resorted to inserting himself into the lineup for exhibition games. Although his teams were outmatched by opponents, Robinson was respected as a disciplinarian coach, and drew the admiration of, among others, Langston University basketball player Marques Haynes, a future member of the Harlem Globetrotters.|$|E
25|$|With PAVN {{strength}} {{reduced to}} four regiments, the Royalist forces {{felt free to}} both refit their worn units and push the Vietnamese for territory. On 8 May, two Royalist columns moved out; one was aimed <b>at</b> <b>Sam</b> Thong, the other at Phou Phasai. On 11 May 1972, six Bataillons Commando (BCs) of Thai mercenaries recaptured the refugee relief center <b>at</b> <b>Sam</b> Thong; they established two artillery fire bases in the vicinity.|$|E

25|$|On 9 and 10 March, BG 308 was helicoptered back to {{its line}} of {{departure}} <b>at</b> <b>Sam</b> Thong to resume moving towards its objective, the Nam Ngum (Ngum River). On 15 March, Task Force Singha gained two more Thai units, Bataillon Commando 601 (BC 601) and Bataillon Commando 602 (BC 602). The newly arrived battalions were directed against Phou Tham Seh, a high point three kilometers north of Skyline Ridge. Despite being overburdened with weighty weaponry, drenched by rain, and chilled by freezing nights, they took the ridge.|$|E
25|$|In March 1970, the North Vietnamese again {{attacked}} on the Plaine des Jarres. A {{few days}} later, on 18 March, an advanced RLAF air base <b>at</b> <b>Sam</b> Thong was overrun. In the {{fighting on the}} Plain des Jarres, the RLAF lost three T-28Ds, plus two O-1 and one U-17 light aircraft. The need for air power became so desperate that Air America C-7 Caribous were used as makeshift bombers, dropping barrels of napalm on the invading Vietnamese. Communist forces pushed {{close enough to the}} RLAF bases at Muang Soui and Long Tieng that combat sortie time dwindled enough that one Hmong T-28 pilot flew 31 missions in a single day.|$|E
25|$|The PAVN {{siege of}} the vital Long Tieng base and its 20 Alternate air strip {{continued}} despite Operation Strength II. On 18 March 1972, the North Vietnamese took the refugee center <b>at</b> <b>Sam</b> Thong, near the guerrilla base. A force from the PAVN 165th Regiment pushed Thai mercenary Bataillon Commando 616 (BC 616) from helicopter landing pad Charlie Charlie on western Skyline Ridge on 19 March. The Vietnamese 335th Independent Regiment held {{the center of}} the ridgeline and its landing pads. Despite the diversionary attacks, of Strength II, with these Vietnamese troops perched overlooking Long Tieng, the 316th Division and 866th Independent Regiment were also poised for an assault to overrun the guerrilla base.|$|E

25|$|The airport's {{master plan}} calls for a fourth (third parallel) runway to be built {{southeast}} of I-70 sometime in the future. Between 2002 and 2004 the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) rebuilt a portion of this Interstate highway running through {{the south end of}} the airport's property. The realigned freeway allows a future taxiway bridge to the proposed fourth runway to cross overhead and has a new traffic interchange for the midfield terminal complex. This I-70 exit (#68) is now the airport's main entrance, replacing the entrance <b>at</b> <b>Sam</b> Jones Expressway (which was built as the Airport Expressway) and High School Road. Provision has been made for future Light Rail Transit (LRT) access to the Weir Cook terminal complex.|$|E
25|$|Utah {{capitalized}} on two UNLV turnovers {{in the first}} half and jumped to a 28–6 halftime lead on the way to a 35–15 victory <b>at</b> <b>Sam</b> Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada. The win improved Utah's record to 5–1 (2–0 MWC) and dropped UNLV's record to 2–5 (0–3 MWC). The first UNLV turnover occurred during the second quarter when Robert Johnson intercepted a pass from Omar Clayton and returned it to the UNLV 8–yard line. Two plays later, Utah scored on a touchdown run by quarterback Terrance Cain. On UNLV's next drive, Robert Johnson scored again when his teammate Christian Cox intercepted a pass and then fumbled the ball into Johnson's hands who returned the ball 64 yards for a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|Thaksin Shinawatra was {{a member}} of the 10th class of the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School, and was then {{admitted}} to the Thai Police Cadet Academy. Graduating in 1973, he joined the Royal Thai Police. He received a master's degree in Criminal Justice from Eastern Kentucky University in the United States in 1975, and three years later was awarded a doctorate in criminal justice <b>at</b> <b>Sam</b> Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas. Returning to Thailand, he reached the position of Deputy Superintendent of the Policy and Planning Sub-division, General Staff Division, Metropolitan Police Bureau, before resigning his commission in 1987 as a lieutenant colonel and leaving the police. His former wife, Potjaman Damapong, is the daughter of a police general and now uses her mother's maiden name.|$|E

25|$|The UNLV Rebels {{football}} team plays <b>at</b> <b>Sam</b> Boyd Stadium, an off-campus stadium which seats 36,800 (with {{the ability to}} seat more than 40,000 if needed) for football and is {{owned and operated by}} the university. The stadium originally opened on October 23, 1971, as the Las Vegas Stadium and was renamed the Las Vegas Silver Bowl in 1978. In 1984, it was renamed Sam Boyd Silver Bowl and Sam Boyd Stadium in 1994. The stadium closed in 1998 and had a reopening in 1999 after a major face lift and renovation that featured an increase from 32,000 seats to 36,800 seats, a renovation of the concourse level, a new press tower featuring luxury suites and club seats and a switch from artificial turf to natural grass. 2003 saw the natural grass replaced with a synthetic surface. In 2009, new Dream Suites were installed in both end zones.|$|E
25|$|Although their {{logistical}} {{system was}} stretched to its limit, the PAVN continued their advance on the Plain along several vectors in early March. On one axis, both the 866th Independent and 165th Regiments bypassed Xieng Khouangville {{to attack the}} Royalist Special Guerrilla Unit 4 stronghold at Khang Kho. The defensive minefields there stymied the communist attack. The PAVN regiments then penetrated further into Royalist territory, fetching up one ridgeline short of the main guerrilla base at Lima Site 20 Alternate. A second advance by elements of the PAVN 174th Regiment split in two to besiege two Royalist guerrilla positions. A third push by the PAVN 148th Regiment established it on the mountain peak of Phou Long Mat near the Royalist rear base <b>at</b> <b>Sam</b> Thong. The Royalist irregular force headquarters were now menaced by the communist advance, and Vang Pao's L'Armee Clandestine was threatened with extinction.|$|E
25|$|With the PAVN onslaught moving southwestwards of the PDJ {{towards the}} Hmong heartland, Vang Pao {{thought of a}} diversionary effort east of the PDJ a la Operation Counterpunch III. Instead, his CIA backers {{supplied}} him with a guerrilla regiment imported from Military Region 3 to the south. Landed on 28 February 1971, Groupement Mobile 31 (GM 31) was tasked with sweeping north from Skyline Ridge overlooking Long Tieng. They swept north toward the refugee center <b>at</b> <b>Sam</b> Thong. However, the operation's start was delayed by insubordination among the troops. Desertions began from Bataillon Guerrier 318 (BG 318) and Bataillon Guerrier 308 (BG 308) on 6 March. BG 318 refused its duties for two days until they were paid their overdue salaries. BG 308 retreated to Long Tieng with a bill of complaints. They were appeased by relief of their commanding officer and the elevation of his deputy. Only after those matters were settled did the guerrillas resume operations.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s Ivey {{returned}} to Seattle. He was {{employed by the}} city as a social worker, and had a daughter with his wife, Helen Taylor. He painted at night in a series of studios, and entered the Seattle Art Museum's Northwest Annual and the Henry Art Gallery's Northwest Invitational shows. He sold his first painting to collector and gallery owner Zoe Dusanne. In 1954 Ivey, Jack Stangle, Ward Corley, and Richard Gilkey were featured in an exhibition of Northwest avant-gardists <b>at</b> <b>SAM.</b> He formed friendships with fellow artists such as Guy Anderson, Leo Kenney, and Carl and Hilda Morris. In the late 1950s he opened the short-lived Artist's Gallery, Seattle's first co-operative artist-owned gallery, with Alden Mason, James FitzGerald, Margaret Tomkins, and others. In 1960, Gordon Woodside became his representative; the same year he received a Ford Foundation grant, and two years later, a grant from the National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities. In 1964 he had his first major solo show, at the Seattle Art Museum; in 1967 he received a Rockefeller Fellowship.|$|E
25|$|Late on 10 March 1972, three battalions of the 165th PAVN Regiment {{struck the}} old refugee relief center <b>at</b> <b>Sam</b> Thong. After {{dividing}} the Thai mercenary garrison with their initial assault, the Communists circled west {{under cover of}} darkness while firing a variety of heavy weapons at the Royalist position. In turn, two Royalist fire support bases that were within range fired artillery support for the Royalists, and a Royal Lao Air Force Douglas AC-47 Spooky also fired support. The front line Royalist battalion clung to its position until dawn. The PAVN began to fire 122mm rockets into the Royalist stronghold. An overcast rolled in, restricting Royalist air support. Just past 1200 hours, the Royalist front line gave way, with the battalion's soldiers retreating westwards and southwards. Nearby Fire Support Base Thunder fell next, less than two hours later. Under fire by Communist machine guns and mortars, the Thai gunners left their howitzers, accompanied by two more Bataillons Commando. BC 610A still remained in position on the southwest edge of the Royalist position.|$|E
25|$|On 13 March 1970, {{contingency}} planning began for evacuation of noncombat personnel from Long Tieng and Sam Thong, as Vang Pao again mulled moving his Hmong community toward the Thai border. Renewed PAVN attacks on 15 March on several Royalist positions in MR 2 began before the evacuation could start. A company of PAVN troops hit {{the perimeter of}} the refugee relief center <b>at</b> <b>Sam</b> Thong. On 17 March, emergency evacuation of Royalist wounded, Laotian civilians, and Americans from Sam Thong began despite continuing wretched flying weather. The next day, the last Hmong irregulars abandoned Sam Thong to the communists, who promptly torched half of it. As the retreating Hmong gathered at Long Tieng, PAVN infantry roved the ridgeline above it five kilometers to the northeast. By now, three-fourths of Long Tieng's populace—the noncombatant portion—was being evacuated via air. The CIA case agents on site destroyed their classified material. Vang Pao's reserves were reduced to two companies of recruits pulled from basic training, his military band, and 28 aviation technicians. However the 20A airfield remained open as Vang Pao personally defended it with a mortar.|$|E
