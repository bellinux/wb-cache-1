5|$|The most {{significant}} {{aspect of the}} book was Wright's method for dividing the meridian; an explanation of how he had constructed <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> the division; and the uses of this information for navigation. Essentially, the problem that occupied Wright was how to depict accurately a globe on a two-dimensional map according to the projection used by Gerardus Mercator in his map of 1569. Mercator's projection was advantageous for nautical purposes as it represented lines of constant true bearing or true course, known as loxodromes or rhumb lines, as straight lines. However, Mercator had not explained his method.|$|E
5|$|Dexter {{is called}} to a crime scene at the {{abandoned}} hospital where, last night, the Ice Truck Killer left security guard Tony Tucci (Brad William Henke) strapped to <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> Dexter to kill. Instead, Dexter had reported the crime scene and Tucci had been hospitalized after the Killer had amputated his hand and leg. Debra and Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) question Tucci when he wakes up in hospital, but Doakes is unimpressed with Debra's ways of extracting information from Tucci. He disapproves of her suggestion to blindfold Tucci to help him to remember his encounter with the Killer, but after she confronts him about his attitude toward her, he agrees to blindfold Tucci, who remembers that the Killer used throat lozenges. They return {{to the crime scene}} and find a lozenge wrapper, on which forensics expert Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee) finds a partial fingerprint.|$|E

5|$|Rob Van Dam (RVD) and Bill Alfonso {{interrupted}} the promo, with RVD stating {{it had nothing}} to do with SmackDown!. RVD claimed that WWE deserved no credit, that the interview was a shoot with no scripts, and that missing One Night Stand was worse than missing WrestleMania. The promo was interrupted when Rhino delivered a Gore. Van Dam's former tag team partner Sabu then appeared following the lights turning off, and had a match with Rhino. Sabu won the match with Van Dam's help, as Van Dam delivered a Van Daminator on Rhino before Sabu delivered the Arabian Skullcrusher on Rhino through <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> the victory.|$|E
5|$|Next was the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament finals for {{the vacant}} TNA World Tag Team Championship between LAX, {{accompanied}} by Guerrero and Salinas, and Team 3D. The duration was eleven minutes and thirty seconds. Devine tried {{to interfere in}} the contest by setting up <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> Team 3D, but Guerrero stopped him {{and set up the}} table for himself outside the ring, placing Devine on top. Guerrero then climbed a padded turnbuckle and jumped onto Devine with a diving foot stomp, forcing him through the table. In the ring, Team 3D performed one of their signature tag team maneuvers, the 3D II, forcing Homicide into the mat and following with a cover, but the referee refused to count because Homicide was not the legal man in the contest. Hernandez then performed his signature Border Toss maneuver on Devon, slamming him into the mat from the top of a turnbuckle. Homicide followed with a splash from the top of a padded turnbuckle on Devon for the pinfall victory, winning the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament and the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E

25|$|A {{virginal}} is {{a smaller}} and simpler rectangular {{form of the}} harpsichord with only one string per note running more or less parallel to the keyboard on the long side of the case. Many, if not most, of the instruments were constructed without legs, and would be placed on <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> playing. Later models were built with their own stands.|$|E
25|$|The second {{match was}} an Extreme Rules {{match for the}} ECW World Championship between {{champion}} The Big Show and Sabu. In the beginning, Sabu gained the advantage in the match as he threw chairs into Big Show's head and leapt off a chair to put Big Show head first through a table. As a result, Big Show began to bleed. After some back and forth action, Sabu took the upper hand as he performed a Spike DDT on Big Show through a table. Big Show performed a Chokeslam on Sabu through <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> the victory.|$|E

25|$|Some Christchurch {{members of}} the ATS moved into Aramoana at about 6:00a.m. on 14 November. The ATS went first to Gray's house, passing bodies on the street. After {{clearing}} neighboring houses, they put a stun grenade into Gray's, blowing out the windows, followed by tear gas. Kicking down the door, they discovered it was empty. The group then worked down the road, checking each house, a squad {{on either side of}} the street. The ATS called up the AOS, with members from Wanganui, Palmerston North, Napier, and New Plymouth, to their backs. The group discovered Sergeant Guthrie's revolver in a garden, and a woman who had been hiding under <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> more than twenty hours.|$|E
25|$|Cookery A {{consists}} of British printed cookery books. Among the major works held are four copies of Hannah Woolley’s The Queen-Like Closet. The earliest edition is from 1672. Woolley {{was one of}} the first women in England to have earned a living from writing and selling books. There are two copies of Pomona: or the Fruit Garden Illustrated (1729) written by the English garden designer, Batty Langley; the book is a gardener's manual for growing, picking and preserving fruits, as well as pruning and caring for plants. Charles Carter's The Complete Practical Cook : or, a new system of the whole art and mystery of cookery (1730) is an illustrated recipe book. It contains copperplate engravings showing how to set and arrange <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> various courses in an 18th-century dinner. Charles Carter cooked for nobility and specialised in French baroque cuisine.|$|E
25|$|The next match saw El Hijo del Perro Aguayo {{challenge}} El Mesías for the AAA Mega Championship. The champion {{was accompanied}} {{to the ring}} by Cibernético, while the challenger was accompanied by his stablemates Héctor Garza and Taya Valkyrie. Towards {{the end of the}} bloody brawl, Aguayo went for the illegal Martinete, which would lead to an automatic disqualification, but was stopped by Garza, leading to an argument between the two stablemates. Garza then attempted to hit El Mesías with a steel chair, but accidentally hit Aguayo instead. As Aguayo began bleeding heavily, the match was stopped for a moment as a doctor entered the ring to check on the cut on his head; Aguayo, however, kept avoiding the doctor, not wanting the match to be ended. El Mesías then speared his challenger through <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> the win and to retain the AAA Mega Championship. Afterwards, Cibernético immediately climbed to the ring and jumped on top of the bloody Aguayo, mocking him, while El Mesías received his title belt. Cibernético then went out of the ring and pushed Hall of Famer Perro Aguayo, who was seated in the front row, before being pulled away by an irate El Mesías as Los Perros del Mal members Halloween, Psicosis and Teddy Hart came ringside to check on the condition of the challenger. Garza attempted to do the same, but was pulled away from Aguayo by Halloween, Psicosis and Hart, who blamed him for the loss. Eventually Los Perros del Mal helped their leader backstage, with Garza following behind.|$|E

500|$|In preparation, Johnson wrote a Plan for the Dictionary. Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, was {{the patron}} of the Plan, to Johnson's displeasure. Seven years after first meeting Johnson {{to go over the}} work, Chesterfield wrote two {{anonymous}} essays in The World recommending the Dictionary. He complained that the English language lacked structure and argued in support of the dictionary. Johnson did not like the tone of the essays, and he felt that Chesterfield had not fulfilled his obligations as the work's patron. In a letter to Chesterfield, Johnson expressed this view and harshly criticised Chesterfield, saying [...] "Is not a patron, my lord, one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water, and when he has reached ground, encumbers him with help? The notice which you have been pleased to take of my labours, had it been early, had been kind: but it has been delayed till I am indifferent and cannot enjoy it; till I am solitary and cannot impart it; till I am known and do not want it." [...] Chesterfield, impressed by the language, kept the letter displayed on <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> anyone to read.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} quietly {{revealed}} to the public by Blow at the 2010 Penny Arcade Expo {{with the help of}} independent developers Chris Hecker and Andy Schatz, who were sharing booth space for demonstrations of their own games, SpyParty and the two provided <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> demonstrating The Witness without any signs or other markings. Blow wanted to keep the demonstration subtle and a surprise and to see players' reactions without the pressure of other players waiting in line to also try the game. Blow himself was present at the Expo but kept his distance from the demonstration table. The fact that The Witness was playable at the Expo was only fully revealed after the Expo by both Blow and Stephen Totilo of Kotaku, who saw and played the game but did not mention its presence until later. Players who tried the game at PAX or saw footage of it from the Kotaku article afterwards became concerned that The Witness would simply be a series of mazes to solve. Blow reiterated that there is more to the game than mazes, and that he encountered similar problems when trying to promote Braid, in that seeing videos of portions of the game does not serve to demonstrate [...] "what happens in the player's mind during the puzzle-solving process".|$|E
