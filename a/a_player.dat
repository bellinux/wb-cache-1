5|$|Each time a {{successful}} attack is performed on <b>a</b> <b>player,</b> their health meter depletes. Players with low health stay stunned for longer when knocked down. <b>A</b> <b>player</b> can increase their health {{by picking up}} food items that randomly appear in the ring. Running and attacks drain stamina. If <b>a</b> <b>player</b> {{does not have enough}} stamina to perform a certain move, it becomes unavailable until they recover. Stamina is regained through not pressing the actions buttons or picking up certain items. Attacks which require more stamina are generally more effective. The stun meter only appears when the opponent is knocked down. It depletes gradually, but the stunned player cannot move until the Stun meter is completely drained. <b>A</b> <b>player</b> can reduce the stun meter faster by pressing the action buttons, or by receiving certain attacks. If <b>a</b> <b>player</b> is low on health, the stun meter will normally be higher, making pin attempts harder to resist. Once a player's health is completely depleted, it will only take one hit to stun them. Certain attacks to a stunned opponent will actually reset the stun meter.|$|E

5|$|If <b>a</b> <b>player</b> who {{has never}} played in an IIHF {{competition}} changes their citizenship, they must participate in national competitions in their new country {{for at least two}} consecutive years and have an international transfer card (ITC).

50|$|The {{player can}} choose from 16 contestants to play as, all {{representing}} different sports. There is <b>a</b> rugby <b>player,</b> <b>a</b> skier, a sumo wrestler, <b>a</b> volleyball <b>player,</b> <b>a</b> shotputter, <b>an</b> ice hockey <b>player,</b> <b>a</b> Football <b>player,</b> <b>a</b> basketball <b>player,</b> <b>a</b> tennis <b>player,</b> <b>a</b> darts <b>player,</b> <b>a</b> racing car driver, <b>an</b> American football <b>player,</b> <b>a</b> boxer, <b>a</b> cricket <b>player,</b> <b>a</b> horse rider and a golfer. There are also three costumes to choose from for each. Players {{can choose from}} a short game, standard game, long game or a custom game.|$|R
50|$|Artifact cards {{reside in}} <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> territory, {{and have a}} sort of {{supplemental}} effect on <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> cards, or on a battle. Typically, only one Artifact can be active during <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> turn, although there are ways to circumvent that restriction.|$|R
50|$|Player Efficiency Rating is John Hollinger's linear-weights {{rating for}} <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> per-minute {{performance}} which reduces <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> total performance {{into a single}} number.|$|R
5|$|If <b>a</b> <b>player</b> who {{has never}} played in an IIHF {{competition}} changes their citizenship, they must participate in national competitions in their new country {{for at least two}} consecutive years and have an international transfer card (ITC). If <b>a</b> <b>player</b> who has previously played in an IIHF tournament wishes to change their national team, they must have played in their new country for four years. <b>A</b> <b>player</b> can only do this once. The original IOC rules stated that an athlete that had already played for one nation could not later change nations under any circumstances.|$|E

50|$|A poker {{advantage}} calculator calculates <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> winning {{ratio and}} normalizes (see Normalization (statistics)) the winning ratio {{relative to the}} number of players. An advantage calculator, provides a normalized value between -100% and +100% describing <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> winning change in a locked domain. That is, if <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> result is -100%, regardless of the number of players in the game, the player will certainly lose the game. If <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> advantage is +100%, regardless of the number of players, the player will certainly win the game.|$|R
50|$|Another pairs {{variation}} is 242 pairs (also known as Australian Pairs). In the first {{end of the}} game the <b>A</b> <b>players</b> lead off with 2 bowls each, then the B players play 4 bowls each, before the <b>A</b> <b>players</b> complete the end with their final 2 bowls. The <b>A</b> <b>players</b> act as lead and skip in the same end. In the second end the roles are reversed with the <b>A</b> <b>players</b> being in the middle. This alternating pattern continues through the game which is typically over 15 ends.|$|R
5|$|The 2007–08 season {{started with}} a {{friendly}} marking the death of Danny Bergara, the manager who had brought Gannon to County as <b>a</b> <b>player</b> in 1990.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>player</b> who commits {{three major}} {{penalties}} (including fighting) {{during a game}} is automatically ejected, suspended, and fined. <b>A</b> <b>player</b> ejected for three major penalties in a game, or for use of weapons, cannot be replaced for five minutes. In 2003, the ECHL added an ejection, fine, and suspension of an additional game for any player charged as an instigator of a fight during the final five minutes of the third period or any overtime. The NHL and AHL adopted the rule in 2005–06, and the NHL includes a fine against the ejected player's head coach.|$|E
50|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{arises from}} the realization of beliefs. <b>A</b> <b>player's</b> payoffs are computed based on beliefs about other players' probability distribution over strategies. In equilibrium, <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> beliefs are correct.|$|R
50|$|On <b>a</b> <b>player’s</b> turn, {{they may}} make either a motion move or a {{directional}} move. If <b>a</b> <b>player’s</b> Commander is captured, their remaining pieces {{fall under the}} command of the capturing player. If all of <b>a</b> <b>player’s</b> pieces except for the Commander have been captured, the Commander is removed from play and the player is out of the game. Play continues clockwise until one player remains.|$|R
5000|$|Wins above {{replacement}} (WAR) {{is another}} popular sabermetric statistic that will evaluate <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> contributions to his team. [...] Similar to VORP, WAR compares <b>a</b> certain <b>player</b> to <b>a</b> replacement-level <b>player</b> {{in order to}} determine the number of additional wins the player has provided to his team. [...] WAR values vary with hitting positions and are largely determined by <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> successful performance and their amount of playing time.|$|R

50|$|Other sabermetric stats, such as runs {{created and}} Wins Above Replacement, attempt to express <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> {{contribution}} directly {{in terms of}} runs and/or wins. However, <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> OPS {{does not have a}} simple intrinsic meaning.|$|R

5|$|Another {{innovation}} was Boost Mode: a two-player, side-scrolling, arcade-style beat 'em up mode {{not included}} in the arcade version, in which <b>a</b> <b>player</b> fights enemy waves to accumulate items, health and experience. For the Xbox, this mode was adapted for online play with Xbox Live, supporting up to 16 players.
