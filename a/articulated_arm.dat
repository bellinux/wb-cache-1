50|$|Many teams {{opted to}} build one <b>articulated</b> <b>arm</b> that {{performed}} all game tasks. A single arm would cap goals and hang off the bar. Because the bonus for hanging off the bar was so substantial, some teams would design their robot entirely around quickly hanging off the bar. Further, some teams would incorporate denial systems so that once their robot hung off the bar, they would block or even actively push off other robots that were already there. A final design was a robot that collected balls {{off the floor and}} dumped them in the corner ball chutes. Grappling hooks were used by some teams.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — To {{interact}} {{with people in}} a human-centered envi-ronment a robot must exhibit intelligent behavior. This requires that the robot possess the ability to adapt its actions to changing environmental conditions. A robot estimates these conditions through sensing; therefore, intelligent behavior requires the ability to coordinate actions with the responses of sensors. That is, intelligent behavior requires sensory motor coordination (SMC). SMC is especially important in dexterous manipulation, which requires <b>articulated</b> <b>arms</b> and end-effectors. To test SMC related hypotheses, researchers at Vanderbilt University developed a simple pneumatic hand, which is described in this paper...|$|R

50|$|In ancient Greece and Rome {{clay and}} ivory dolls, dated from around 500 BC, {{were found in}} children's tombs.

This rod was used to manipulate the doll from above, exactly as is done today in Sicilian puppetry. A few of these dolls had strings {{in place of the}} rods. Some researchers believe these ancient figures were mere toys and not puppets due to their small size.|$|R
