5|$|On 5 September 2007, Chris Taylor, {{mounted on}} a {{pantomime}} horse, confronted police officers, who were on foot, and <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they needed any reinforcements against APEC protesters. When his offer was refused, Taylor took the horse for a stroll anyway, and was met by amused onlookers and media personnel. He was later asked by police officers to remove his clothing for examination, since it resembled a police uniform; but no charges of impersonating police were laid. The reference was to the horse flu outbreak, which forced police officers to face APEC protesters on foot. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode.|$|E
5|$|Soldiers at {{the base}} noticed warning signs, {{including}} groups of men watching the construction from the nearby village, which was set at a higher elevation than the outpost, and other groups of men moving through nearby mountains. At a dinner meeting in the village, a villager told the Americans that they should shoot any men seen in the mountains, and <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> U.S. UAVs were keeping watch nearby. The day before the attack, the militants began flowing water through an irrigation ditch feeding an unused field, creating background noise that masked {{the sounds of the}} advancing fighters.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Sverdrup {{joined with}} his former University of Minnesota {{engineering}} professor John Ira Parcel {{in the formation of}} Sverdrup & Parcel, a civil engineering firm with a speciality field of bridges. Parcel had tenure at Minnesota {{for a long time and}} was reluctant to sever his ties completely, but eventually he decided to join the new company, taking an unpaid Sabbatical from the university for one year. Sverdrup owned 60% and Parcel 40%of the new firm, which opened its doors on 1 April 1928. The company's headquarters was located in St. Louis, Missouri. Sverdrup & Parcel's first contract was for the design of a bridge over the Missouri River at Hermann, Missouri, for which it received a fee of $33,000. While at the Missouri State Highway Department Sverdrup met D. C. Wolfe and E. R. Grant, and he <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they would join the company. Sverdrup subsequently hired design engineer Brice R. Smith from Missouri's leading supplier of bridge components. By 1936, all three would become partners in the firm.|$|E
25|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that {{if a child is}} {{intelligent}} enough to ask the four questions, the child <b>asks</b> <b>them.</b> <b>If</b> the child is not intelligent enough, the wife <b>asks</b> <b>them.</b> <b>If</b> the wife does not ask the questions, the leader of the seder <b>asks</b> <b>them.</b> And even two scholars who know the laws of Passover must ask one another (if no one else can ask).|$|R

5|$|The episode {{starts in}} a {{courtroom}} where Lisa is on trial. The Blue-Haired Lawyer is accusing her of bringing devastation upon Springfield because of her selfish desire {{to be accepted by}} others. Lisa starts telling everyone in the courtroom about her side of the story. A few months ago, she and her family went to the new mall in town. There, she encountered her schoolmates Sherri and Terri and <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> she could spend some time with them at the mall. The two twins said no to Lisa, which made her realize that she has no real friends. Later, Lisa went on Homer's computer and discovered that it is easier to make friends online than in real life, and thus she started a social networking website called SpringFace to get friends. The site became instantly popular among all the citizens of Springfield and Lisa made over a thousand friends {{in a short period of}} time. However, Lisa soon noticed that these friends only talked to her on SpringFace and not in real life. She also discovered that the website grew too big to control, with people becoming so addicted to it that they even used it while driving their cars. This caused chaos in the town after numerous car crashes and deaths.|$|E
25|$|On one occasion, Zhang Cheng's son Zhang Jian (張戩) and nephew Zhang Ling (張陵; Zhang Fan's son) were {{kidnapped by}} bandits in Shandong. When Zhang Fan {{asked them to}} release the boys, they freed only Zhang Ling. Zhang Fan then <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> he could trade his son for his nephew instead because his nephew was younger. The bandits were so {{impressed}} by his act of sacrifice that they released both Zhang Ling and Zhang Jian.|$|E
25|$|In October 1163, Henry {{summoned the}} ecclesiastical {{hierarchy}} to Westminster {{to hear his}} complaints about the governance of the English Church. At first, the bishops {{did not agree with}} the king, who then <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they would agree to observe the ancient customs of England. The bishops remained steadfastly behind Becket, and refused to agree to observe the customs if they conflicted with canon law. The council only met for a day, and the next day, the king took his heir, Henry the Young King, out of Becket's custody, as well as confiscating all the honours that he had formerly given to Becket. This was effectively a dismissal of Becket from royal favour.|$|E

40|$|The {{author of}} this article {{mentions}} how some Maltese readers and writers find the Maltese language problematic; a puzzle which may appear too random and difficult to piece together and so they condemn and question {{the use of the}} language. The author goes on to debate this argument by <b>asking</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they ever took a moment to understand the Maltese language. He <b>asks</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they ever read a verse by Dun Karm, or a few words by Professor Temi Zammit insisting that if they did they would not certainly not see the Maltese language as a chaotic language. peer-reviewe...|$|R

25|$|When the revolts began, Reynolds {{was asleep}} in her home in San Juan. At 2 A.M. she was awakened when more than forty armed policemen and National Guardsmen showed up at her doorstep. Even though {{they did not have}} a search warrant they {{proceeded}} to search the house, and confiscated her papers and speeches. When she <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they had a search warrant they answered that they didn't but that they did have an order to arrest her. The police claimed that their actions were justified under the provisions of the Gag Law (Law 53) of Puerto Rico, known as the Ley de la Mordaza. Reynolds was taken into custody along with Carmen María Pérez Roque and Olga Viscal Garriga. She was held for various days at police headquarters before she was transferred to La Princesa Prison.|$|E
25|$|The two {{suspects}} at first denied {{any involvement in}} Meddour's death, but after he was remanded on probable cause, Nödtveidt eventually made a confession. His account started the night of 21 to 22 July 1997, which he spent drinking at various pubs and clubs in Göteborg, along with Vlad and two other friends. In the early morning, the two other friends headed back home, while Nödtveidt and Vlad started roaming in the city centre. Next to a park locally known as a meeting place for gay men, they were accosted by a stranger, who {{at the sight of}} their clothes <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they were Satanist, and told them he wanted to learn about this cult. At first, Nödtveidt and Vlad tried to push back the unknown man, but he insisted. This was how they came to know Meddour.|$|E
25|$|The {{citizens}} are {{shown to be}} a mixed bag. 98% are unemployed (due to advances in robotics) and range from lazy and sloth-like to highly rebellious violent criminals, bent on destroying and killing {{as much as they can}} for whatever reason they can think of at that time, if any. Most of the Judges seem to view them like a well-loved dim cat, stupid, greedy but with an unseen value that's worth protecting with everything they have. Although at times they've shown a huge lack of empathy towards them, such as when Chief Judge Francisco <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> a large number that were on welfare could commit suicide in his Christmas message in order to help balance the budget for the following year. Some Judges openly view them as a nuisance to be removed, or like Judge Manners, as a sub-human race to be used and abused as the Judges see fit.|$|E

25|$|Police {{officers}} found a {{fire extinguisher}} and squirted its foam into {{the wounds of}} an injured occupant. Other occupants were thrown down the stairs head-first. Eventually, they dragged all occupants into the ground-floor hall, where they had gathered dozens of prisoners {{from all over the}} building in a mess of blood and excrement. They threw her on top of two other people. They were not moving, and Lena Zuhlke drowsily <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they were alive. They did not reply, and she lay there on her back, unable to move her right arm, unable to stop her left arm and her legs twitching, blood seeping out of her head wounds. A group of police officers walked by, and each one lifted the bandana which concealed his identity, leaned down and spat on her face. Many victims of the raid were taken to the San Martino hospital, where police officers walked up and down the corridors, slapping their clubs into the palms of their hands, ordering the injured not to move around or look out of the window, keeping handcuffs on many of them and then, often with injuries still untended, shipping them across the city to join scores of others, from the Diaz school and from the street demonstrations, detained at the detention centre in the city's Bolzaneto district.|$|E
500|$|On April 24, 1974, {{the three}} winning {{designers}} {{were brought to}} Washington, D.C. [...] After {{a tour of the}} White House and meetings with the congressional committees which considered the coin bills, they went to the Treasury Building and received their $5,000 checks from the new Treasury Secretary, William E. Simon, who jokingly <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they wanted to invest their awards in savings bonds.|$|E
500|$|Forman recounted {{this memory}} to fellow film enthusiasts and colleagues Ivan Passer and Jaroslav Papousek and <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> {{it might be}} the basis for a good film. [...] "Maybe", replied Passer, [...] "but it still needs one more thing – a billiards table." [...] The trio had a passion for billiards and felt that they could make a success of even the weakest idea if they had ready access to a table. Having found a good one at Dobříš Castle, the three, along with Václav Sasek, wrote a {{screenplay}} that fleshed out Forman's encounter with the young woman from Varnsdorf.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to the Church of Scientology's claims of inaccuracies in the article, a lawyer for Time responded [...] "We've reviewed all of their allegations, and find {{nothing wrong with the}} Time story." [...] In June 1991, Newsweek reported that staffers for Time said they had received calls from a man claiming to be a paralegal for Time, who <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they had signed a confidentiality form about the article. Time editors sent staffers a computer memo, warning them about calls related to the article, and staffers told Newsweek that [...] "sources named in the story say detectives have asked about their talks with Time". A Church of Scientology spokesman called the claims [...] "scurrilous".|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Lions, The Black Crowes and Oasis, with opening band Spacehog, {{embarked}} on a co-headlining tour of North American theaters and amphitheaters.

[...] said Rich. [...] The Black Crowes performed last each night, and their seventy-five-minute set always included numerous songs from Lions. [...] Members of Oasis typically would join them for an encore cover such as [...] "Lucifer Sam", [...] "Can't You Hear Me Knocking" [...] or [...] "Road Runner".|$|E
500|$|On {{hearing of}} the twins' {{interest}} in the show, Brock Akil <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> their management was aware of her writing style. When questioned by Brock Akil, Tia responded: [...] "I'm a woman, Mara. I can do this." [...] Though Tia was chosen for the part, Tamera later appeared as a guest star during the show's fifth season. Brock Akil said that Tia won the role over Tamera {{because she had a}} more [...] "serious personality" [...] and [...] "made all the necessary adjustments to get this part". The producer explained that she appreciated Tia's work ethic and her strong desire {{to be a part of}} the series; she described Tia's audition as [...] "fighting everybody's preconceived notions of her" [...] by playing the more mature Melanie.|$|E

500|$|After ceasing {{internal}} game development, 3D Realms approached noted game developers Gearbox Software and <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> {{they were}} interested in helping Triptych Games polish the nearly finished PC version and port it to the consoles. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford, who had worked on an expansion to Duke Nukem 3D and very briefly on Forever before he left to found Gearbox, felt that [...] "Duke can't die" [...] and decided {{that he was going to}} help [...] "in Duke’s time of need." [...] He started providing funding for the game and contacted 2K Games' president to persuade his company that Gearbox and Triptych can complete the development of the game and get it released on all platforms in time. Duke Nukem Forever was originally intended to be a PC exclusive game, however 2K and Gearbox had hired Piranha Games to port the game designed for PC to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and added a Multiplayer in order to raise sales.|$|E
500|$|Princeton University Press {{received}} {{a copy of}} the typescript lithograph edition with hand corrections from Smyth on August 17, 1945. The typographers had already started work from another copy. Maple Press of York, Pennsylvania, was lined up to do the printing. Because of wartime shortages, one of a publisher’s biggest worries was finding adequate supplies of paper. Smith approached Manny and Leonard Relles from Central Paper, told them about the Smyth Report and its significance, and <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they could deliver [...] of paper to Maple Press in twelve days. They found a carload of paper on a siding in New England and sent it to York, providing enough paper for 30,000 copies, only half what Princeton University Press wanted. [...] The first edition of 30,000 copies was printing when word was received that paper had been found for another 30,000 copies. The presses were held for three hours while the train made its way to a siding in York, where the paper was unloaded and brought to the printing plant by trucks.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} Hollywood studios had {{contacted}} George R.R. Martin about possible adaptation {{of his book}} series A Song of Ice and Fire into a film, however Martin expressed the opinion the books could not {{be made into a}} film as too much would have to be cut from the books, but thought it could be made into a television series. In January 2006, David Benioff spoke to Martin's literary agent about the books he represented for possible adaption, and the agent sent the first four books of A Song of Ice and Fire to David Benioff. Benioff read a few hundred pages of the first book in the series, A Game of Thrones, called D. B. Weiss and said: [...] "Maybe I'm crazy, but I haven't had this much fun reading anything in about 20 years. So take a look because I think it might make a great HBO series." [...] Weiss, who then read the first book in two days, was very enthusiastic about a possible television project based on the books. They arranged a meeting with Martin, who <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> they knew who Jon Snow’s real mother might be, and was satisfied with their answer.|$|E
