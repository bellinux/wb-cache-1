The International SOS <b>alarm</b> <b>centre</b> and clinic in Ho Chi Minh City sent a first response team of three doctors, a nurse, an interpreter, and an operations manager. Rescue efforts {{were carried out}} with cranes, rather than by direct entry of rescue personnel, due to {{the danger of the}} collapse of remaining portions of the ramp.Thirty professional rescuers from Japan and the Philippines were dispatched to the accident site to participate in the rescue effort.Lưu Thành Đồng, vice director of Cần Thơ Public Transportation Service (Sở Giao thông Công chánh) stated to BBC Vietnam that [...] "as long there is hope of survivors, the rescue efforts will continue." [...] Four days after the accident, on Saturday, September 29, rescue efforts were suspended, as the likelihood of finding further survivors was considered very low.|$|E
40|$|An {{initiative}} {{for the design}} of an automatic safety-alarm system is proposed. The alarm system will be designed for elderly people, who are living independently and need some assistive care. It has to detect an emergency at home, and in that case, it has to send an alarm signal to an <b>alarm</b> <b>centre.</b> The detection is done with remote sensors. The emergencies are detected by monitoring and analysing the ``Activities of Daily Living'' (ADL) of the elderly person at home. In this article, the product demands are worked out and a description is given how the automatic safety-alarm system can be built up, and which technologies and components could be used...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to gain knowledge about the extent and variations in falls among home-dwelling elderly throughout the day, the week and the seasons for men and women and different age groups. Data about falls are collected from “SOS International Trygghetssentralen” in connection with safety alarm activation and response All responses to falls in January, February, June and July 2013 in Oslo to persons 76 years and older with a safety alarm is studied, total 1548 falls. Most falls were registered on Mondays and during the winter months. As much as 36 percent of all fallen happens at night between 23 pm and 8 am. This result differs from other studies. The cause of this is unknown. There is a great need for research on the causes of the high incidence falls at night...|$|E

50|$|Dual {{signalling}} is {{a method}} of alarm transmission that uses a mobile phone network and a telephone and/or IP path to transmit intruder, fire and personal attack signals at high speed from the protected premises to an <b>Alarm</b> Receiving <b>Centre</b> (ARC). It most commonly uses GPRS or GSM, a high-speed signalling technology used to send and receive ‘packets’ of data, with a telephone line in addition. The option of IP is not used as frequently due to issues with installation and configuration as {{a high level of}} I.T expertise is often required in addition to alarm installation knowledge.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} and practically verify the reliability and safety of communicators from the perspective of a potential attack on the security system connected through a telephone line to the ARC (<b>Alarm</b> Receiving <b>Centre).</b> The Intruder and Hold-up Alarm System (I&HAS) itself without being connected to the ACR, is actually an acoustical optical signaling device which does not deal with the comprehensive protection of property and may not fully discourage a potential offender from entering a guarded object. The theoretical part describes the individual transmission paths of the access telephone network, the principles of communication between the I&HAS and ARC, the connection systems and their signaling. The pitfalls of the transmission paths and the possibility of their attack are also defined. The practical part describes the implementation of one of the possible techniques of attack in detail...|$|R
5000|$|Remote {{alarm systems}} {{are used to}} connect the control unit to a {{predetermined}} monitor of some sort, and they come in many different configurations. High-end systems connect to a central station or first responder (e.g. police/fire/medical) via a direct phone wire, a cellular network, a radio network (i.e. GPRS/GSM), or an IP path. In {{the case of a}} dual signalling system two of these options are utilized simultaneously. The alarm monitoring includes not only the sensors, but also the communication transmitter itself. While direct phone circuits are still available in some areas from phone companies, because of their high cost and the advent of dual signalling with its comparatively lower cost they are becoming uncommon. Direct connections are now most usually seen only in federal, state, and local government buildings, or on a school campus that has a dedicated security, police, fire, or emergency medical department (in the UK communication is only possible to an <b>alarm</b> receiving <b>centre</b> - communication directly to the emergency services is not permitted).|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the need of}} including acoustical perspectives in the debate on alarm fatigue within the healthcare domain. We show how conceptualisations and proposed solutions to alarm fatigue are unequally distributed across {{what could be called}} the ‘alarm chain’: a generic model of the core structural elements and dynamic relations that constitute any alarm scenario. A focal point in the alarm chain – the ‘alarm mediation cleft’ – seems to divide the alarm fatigue literature from the segment of the alarm literature that deals with auditory alarm design. The current healthcare discourse on <b>alarm</b> fatigue is <b>centred</b> around the ‘premediated alarm phase’, which has the consequence of an unfortunate dichotomous approach to the functionality of sound. We address some shortcomings of this approach and outline some methodological implications and potentials of searching for signs of alarm fatigue in the ‘post-mediated alarm phase’...|$|R

40|$|Spermatogenesis is an {{essential}} stage in human male gamete development, which is regu-lated by many Y chromosome specific genes. Most of these genes are centred in a specific region located on the long arm of the human Y chromosome known as the azoospermia factor region (AZF). Deletion events are common in Y chromosome because of its pe-culiar structural organization. Astonishingly, among the several known genetic causes of male infertility, Y chromosomal microdeletions emerged as the most frequent structural chromosome anomaly associated with the quantitative reduction of sperm. The develop-ment of assisted reproductive techniques (ART) like intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and testicular sperm extraction (TESE) helps to bypass the natural barriers of fertilization, but it increases the concern about the transmission of genetic defects. Ex-perimental evidence suggested that the men with Y chromosomal microdeletions verti-cally transmitted their deletion as well as related fertility disorders to their offspring via these ART techniques. In India, infertility is on <b>alarming</b> rise. ART <b>centres</b> have opened up in virtually every state but still most of the infertility centres in India do not choos...|$|R

Sustav relejne zaštite ima zadatak izoliranja dionica koje se nalaze u kvaru. Aktivacija određene zaštite šalje alarm u trafostanicu i dispečerski centar. Alarmi u dispečerski centar dolaze u kratkom vremenu što može dispečera zbuniti i navesti na pogrešku. Pravilan pristup i odabir metode za analiziranje alarma vrlo su bitna stvar za lociranje dionice u kvaru. Poznate su dvije metode za analiziranje kvara a to su metoda niza i metoda hipoteza. Analizirani su alarmi koji se pojavljuju prilikom odvajanja TS 35 / 10 kV Istok od ostatka elektroenergetskog sustava. Cilj ovog rada je analiziranje alarma koji su se pojavili u dispečerskom centru prilikom ispada TS 35 / 10 kV Istok metodom niza i metodom hipoteza.
