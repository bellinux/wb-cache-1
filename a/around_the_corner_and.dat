500|$|Cooder's displeasure {{with the}} Republican Party and its {{financial}} supporters, particularly the Koch Brothers, also inspired his songwriting. He found {{the party to}} be [...] "insanely dangerous" [...] to Barack Obama's presidency and the US, and said of them in an interview for The Guardian, [...] "in case anybody thinks Michele Bachmann or Sarah Palin are clowns because they misspeak or don't know their history or they say silly things: that's just an act, and it's a useful act. Everything is a distraction from the core truths which are, first of all, that corporations have taken over the country." [...] He viewed that his songs for the album provide a more convenient alternative for citizens who do not research politicians, saying that [...] "I don't write books and give speeches but with a four-minute song you can use allegory and other means to suggest {{a different point of}} view. It's like looking <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner,</b> <b>and</b> that's what songs are good at sometimes. They hit you with a new thought – assuming that people will listen." ...|$|E
500|$|Ambrose's family takes {{refuge in}} the TARDIS, but the Doctor, Amy and Rory find {{a crack in the}} cavern wall similar to those they have seen before. The Doctor surmises that the crack was caused by an {{explosion}} in time, which might have left [...] "shrapnel" [...] behind. He reaches in and pulls out an object which he wraps in a handkerchief. Before he can explain, Restac, dying from the toxic exposure, crawls <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> fires at the Doctor, but Rory pushes him {{out of the way and}} takes the shot, dying in Amy's arms. As the crack begins to absorb Rory's body, the Doctor realises that Rory will be written out of history and forces Amy to board the TARDIS before the drill explodes. He tries to help her concentrate on remembering Rory, but a jolt from the TARDIS causes her to lose concentration and her memories of Rory are lost. The Doctor finds Amy's engagement ring, which Rory had stowed before the events, on the floor of the TARDIS.|$|E
500|$|The next {{race was}} just <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner,</b> <b>and</b> {{it was a}} big one. The 1990 Xerox Challenge was {{organised}} by Robin Judkins as one of the sporting events to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. It was by far the hardest; the 22-day multi-sport event covered the length of the country—from Cape Reinga to Bluff—and included road cycling, kayaking, running, and mountain biking. There were 67 competitors, including 6 women, who embarked on the [...] challenge. While Lynch was the favourite for the women, she soon developed severe tendonitis and the race doctor threatened to pull her from the race if she refused to take an anti-inflammatory. She had no option but to take the medication if she wanted to remain in the race, and promptly ended up in Wellington Hospital from the reaction to the medication. Fortunately for her, the fellow competitors were stuck in nearby Makara Beach, waiting for the weather in Cook Strait to settle enough to enable the kayak section. After two days, organisers abandoned the plan for the kayak section and Lynch was well enough to rejoin the race. The event featured every night on prime time TV {{and by the end of}} it, the two winners had become household names in New Zealand: Lynch, and Steve Gurney. It was Lynch's hardest race over her entire career and contributes to her being regarded as a [...] "legend" [...] of the New Zealand mountain bikers.|$|E

2500|$|Carmichael's eulogy for [...] "hot" [...] jazz, however, was premature. Big-band swing {{was just}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner,</b> <b>and</b> jazz would soon turn in another {{direction}} with new bandleaders, such as the Dorseys and Benny Goodman, and new singers, such as Bing Crosby, leading the way. Carmichael's output followed the changing trend. In 1933 he began a long-lasting collaboration with lyricist Johnny Mercer, newly arrived in New York, on [...] "Lazybones", which became a hit. Southern Music published the sheet music in 1933; more than 350,000 copies of it were sold in three months. [...] Carmichael collaborated with Mercer on nearly three dozen songs, including [...] "Thanksgiving," [...] "Moon Country," [...] and the 1951 Academy Award-winner for best song, [...] "In the Cool, Cool, Cool, of the Evening." [...] Carmichael's financial condition improved dramatically when royalties started to pour in, affording him a comfortable apartment and dapper clothes. His social life was also on the upswing, finding him hobnobbing with George Gershwin, Fred Astaire, Duke Ellington, and other music giants in the New York entertainment scene.|$|E
2500|$|Former inmate Leon [...] "Whitey" [...] Thompson, {{who worked}} as a guide at Alcatraz for many years and later visited it {{regularly}} before his death in 2005, believed that Alcatraz Island is haunted and has stated that [...] "he could feel it" [...] while he was incarcerated there. [...] He later believed the prison to be [...] "damned", and often had the sense of being watched by spirits. During his time in the prison, Thompson was friendly with an inmate named Johnny Haus, a big Texan. He last saw him on 25 October 1962 when he left Alcatraz and knew he'd never see Haus again. One day in the 1980s when Thompson was alone in the cellhouse waiting for visitors to arrive for a tour, he claimed to have seen a large dark figure {{at the end of the}} [...] "Michigan Avenue" [...] corridor. [...] He saw the apparition walk <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> out of sight. Thompson rushed to the end of the corridor, but nobody was there. He believed the ghost to be that of Haus, by the way he walked and the feeling which the figure gave off. [...] Afterwards, Thompson said [...] "I don't care what anybody says, that was Johnny Haus".|$|E

50|$|The U.S. Custom House in Galveston is a simply {{detailed}} Classical Revival, two-story, {{brick building}} {{located near the}} waterfront in Galveston.

2500|$|Schumacher {{came back}} after his {{suspension}} for the European Grand Prix, which he won by about 25 seconds, {{to take a}} lead of 5 points into the penultimate round in Japan. The race in Japan was held in torrential rain, with Hill managing to win the restarted race, by three seconds on aggregate over Schumacher who finished second. Going into the final round at Adelaide, Schumacher led Hill by a single point. Mansell took pole for Williams, but had a poor start which let Hill and Schumacher through {{to fight for the}} lead and the 1994 title. Midway through the race, Schumacher's perceived need for a low downforce setup cost him, as he lost control and clipped the outside wall at the 5th corner (out of sight of Hill). As Schumacher recovered, Hill came <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> attempted to overtake into the next corner. Schumacher turned in and the resulting contact (Schumacher in the wall and Hill retiring with bent suspension), meant Schumacher was the champion. This collision has been controversial. Some, such as Williams's Patrick Head, have suggested that this was a deliberate attempt by Schumacher to take Hill out of the race. Others, such as then BBC commentator Murray Walker, defended Schumacher, calling the accident a [...] "racing incident".|$|E
