5|$|As {{they share}} many {{cross-platform}} games and {{compete for the}} same audience as their predecessors, frequent comparisons are made between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The PS3 uses the Blu-ray format, while the Xbox 360 uses a standard DVD9. The Xbox 360 is less expensive to produce, and <b>analysts</b> <b>expect</b> that a mid-revision will allow Microsoft to break-even on manufacturing costs, while industry consensus is that the Xbox 360's conventional architecture is easier to develop for.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide use {{of solar}} power and wind power {{continued}} to grow significantly in 2012. Solar electricity consumption increased by 58 percent, to 93 terawatt-hours (TWh). Use of wind power in 2012 increased by 18.1 percent, to 521.3 TWh. Global solar and wind energy installed capacities continued to expand even though new investments in these technologies declined during 2012. Worldwide investment in solar power in 2012 was $140.4billion, an 11 percent decline from 2011, and wind power investment was down 10.1 percent, to $80.3billion. But due to lower production costs for both technologies, total installed capacities grew sharply. This investment decline, but growth in installed capacity, may again occur in 2013. <b>Analysts</b> <b>expect</b> the market to triple by 2030. In 2015, investment in renewables exceeded fossils.|$|E

25|$|Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code allows {{an income}} tax credit of 2.3 cents/kilowatt-hour (as {{adjusted}} for inflation for 2013) {{for the production of}} electricity from utility-scale wind turbines, geothermal, solar, hydropower, biomass and marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy plants. This incentive, the renewable energy Production Tax Credit (PTC), was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (at the value of 1.5 cents/kilowatt-hour, which has since been adjusted annually for inflation). In late 2015 a large majority in Congress voted to extend the PTC for wind and solar power for 5 years and $25 billion. <b>Analysts</b> <b>expect</b> $35 billon of investment for each type.|$|E

25|$|File sharing {{researcher}} Daniel Johansson {{called the}} ruling {{the most important}} file sharing related verdict in Europe so far, comparing it to the Napster verdict in the US. The sentence is the longest ever awarded under Swedish copyright law, and the prison time and damage compensation high by Swedish standards. While most legal experts expected the court to find the defendants guilty, they were surprised at the harsh verdict. Sociology of law professor Håkan Hyden criticised the exceptionally harsh sentence on both the prison time and large amount of compensation awarded, and some legal <b>analysts</b> <b>expect</b> the punishments to be radically lowered in higher courts.|$|E
25|$|The {{calculus}} for {{peak oil}} has {{changed with the}} introduction of unconventional production methods. In particular, the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has resulted in a significant increase in production from previously uneconomic plays. <b>Analysts</b> <b>expect</b> that $150 billion will be spent on further developing North American tight oil fields in 2015. The large increase in tight oil production {{is one of the reasons}} behind the price drop in late 2014. Certain rock strata contain hydrocarbons but have low permeability and are not thick from a vertical perspective. Conventional vertical wells would be unable to economically retrieve these hydrocarbons. Horizontal drilling, extending horizontally through the strata, permits the well to access a much greater volume of the strata. Hydraulic fracturing creates greater permeability and increases hydrocarbon flow to the wellbore.|$|E
25|$|Since 1993, China {{has been}} a net {{importer}} of oil, {{a large portion of}} which comes from the Middle East. Imported oil accounts for 20% of the processed crude in China. Net imports are expected to rise to 3.5millionbarrels (560,000m3) per day by 2010. China is interested in diversifying the sources of its oil imports and has invested in oil fields around the world. China is developing oil imports from Central Asia and has invested in Kazakhstani oil fields. Beijing also plans to increase China's natural gas production, which currently accounts for only 3% of China's total energy consumption and incorporated a natural gas strategy in its 10th Five-Year Plan (2001–2005), with the goal of expanding gas use from a 2% share of total energy production to 4% by 2005 (gas accounts for 25% of U.S. energy production). <b>Analysts</b> <b>expect</b> China's consumption of natural gas to more than double by 2010.|$|E

25|$|Since {{emerging}} from bankruptcy, Warnaco Group’s annual income Reports have shown steady growth. Calvin Klein {{continues to be}} a strong performer for the company in both the jeans and intimates sectors. As of 2 January 2010, the company operated over 1,000 Calvin Klein retail stores worldwide as well as three online stores. It also licenses or franchises an additional 624 stores and the Calvin Klein brand accounted for 75% of the Warnaco Group's $2 billion net sales in 2009. At the end of 2010's second quarter (ending 3 July), Warnaco reported that all three divisions— Intimates, Swimwear and Sportswear— contributed to its 14% growth in net revenues to $519.3 million and industry <b>analysts</b> <b>expect</b> continued growth. In August 2010 The Motley Fool named Warnaco one of its Top 10 Values in Consumer Durables, citing the stock's low price-to-earnings multiples as well as its low risk and its potential for growth.|$|E
25|$|The airline {{struggled}} {{to cut costs}} in order to compete {{with a wave of}} new, low-cost carriers in the region. The airline lost RM443.4million (US$137.4million) {{in the first quarter of}} 2014. The second quarter—the first in the aftermath of Flight 370's disappearance - saw a loss of RM307.04million (US$97.6million), which represented a 75% increase over losses from the second-quarter of 2013. As a result, MAS has not made a profit since 2010. In the previous three years, the airline had booked losses of: RM1.17billion (US$356million) in 2013, RM433million in 2012, and RM2.5billion in 2011. Industry <b>analysts</b> <b>expect</b> MAS to lose further market share and face a challenging environment to stand out from competitors while addressing their financial plight. The company's stock, down as much as 20% following the disappearance of Flight370, had fallen 80% over the previous five years, which contrasts with a rise in the Malaysian stock market of about 80% over the same period.|$|E
500|$|Activision stated on January 21, 2008 that North American {{sales from}} all of the Guitar Hero {{franchise}} have exceeded one billion dollars with over 16 million units sold, excluding downloadable content. Over 20 million songs have been sold as downloadable content as of July 2008, and 34 million by May 2009. As of October 9, 2008, the series has sold 23 million units with sales of US$1.6 billion, and as of May 2009 has earned US$2 billion at retail. Activision claims that Guitar Hero is the third largest video game franchise after the Mario and Madden NFL series, and is present in over 15 million households. Guitar Hero: World Tour along with other music games such as Rock Band 2 have surged the video game market in 2008; NPD Group reports cited that music video games made up 19% of the overall software industry sales in July 2008, and 16% through November 2008, and contributing to a 32% year-to-date sector growth through July 2008. [...] Total sales of music games doubled in 2008, with total sales of US$1.9 billion. Guitar Hero represented about half of that figure, with a total of $992M of retail sales in 2008, and was the highest selling brand of the year. At the 2009 Consumer Electronics Show, Activision CEO Mike Griffith stated that Guitar Hero III is the first video game to exceed one billion dollars in total sales. Activision reported that the Guitar Hero franchise had 55% of the United States and European markets during the first quarter of 2009. <b>Analysts</b> <b>expect</b> 2009 to be a critical year to determine the future direction of music games, whether the sector will continue to grow or will remain stagnant. Early analysis {{of the first half of}} 2009 showed that sales of both Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchise games were down by half from the same period in 2008, likely due to fewer purchases of the more expensive game bundles that include one or more controllers, as well as large discounts on the prices of older games. Viacom, parent company of MTV Games, reported a 32% drop in 2009 second quarter profits, partially driven by weak sales of Rock Band amid the poor economy of the period.|$|E
