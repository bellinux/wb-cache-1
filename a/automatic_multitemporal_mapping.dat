40|$|This paper {{describes}} a procedure for an <b>automatic</b> <b>multitemporal</b> interpretation of vegetation areas, which uses both structural features and temporal knowledge. For {{the interpretation of}} vegetation areas the concept of manual interpretation by using interpretation keys was transformed into the automatic interpretation system. For interpretation of temporal changes an approach was used, which discretely describes temporal conditions of regions, and which transfers the most probable temporal changes of the given conditions as temporal knowledge into a state transition diagram, then using it for multitemporal interpretation. Based on these approaches a procedure for <b>automatic</b> <b>multitemporal</b> interpretation of industrially used moorland was successfully developed. Proceeding from an initial segmentation based on Geo-Data a resegmentation and {{an interpretation of the}} segments is carried out for each investigated epoch. By using temporal knowledge it is possible to separate moor classes, which can only be detected in temporal order. The application of temporal knowledge and structural features enables the exclusive use of grey scale images for interpretation of vegetation areas. The results show that the presented procedure is suitable for multitemporal interpretation of moorland, and that it is able to distinguish additional moor classes compared to the approaches used so far. It is further applicable for a more robust multitemporal interpretation, and does not depend on colour images. 1...|$|R

Geomorphologic survey and photogeologic interpretation of multitemporal aerial photographs and a Quickbird satellite imagery (from 1976 to 2005) were carried out in order to analyse both the geologic features of the landslide and the state of activity. Metric use of multitemporal remote sensing imagery allowed us to measure and then to interpolate ground displacement of homologous targets, so achieving <b>multitemporal</b> <b>maps</b> of displacements. We obtained a model where the occurrence of rigid behaviour lithotypes (Mt.

Landscape structure indices were obtained from selected areas, comprising two colonist settlement projects and an area occupied by large rancher farms. The landscape fragmentation indices were compared with land tenure data obtained from rural census. The results from this analysis indicated that the areas occupied by colonists show a distinct landscape structure from the area occupied by large rancher farms. Land tenure analyses demonstrated that although the original colonist lots tend to be aggregated by neighboring farmers, many lots were divided into smaller properties among the family members.

40|$|The {{second half}} of the 20 th century {{witnessed}} the rapid expansion of built-up areas practically all over the world. In Portugal, this phenomenon took place particularly along the coastal strip and around its two main cities, Lisbon and Porto. Economic and demographic growth led to processes of urban expansion, which in turn bolstered the development of extensive urbanized continuums, contributing to the consolidation of the metropolitan areas and transformation of landscapes. Greater knowledge of the recent processes of urbanization is of interest to the geographical sciences, as well as to applied fields such as spatial planning. Since their initial development, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and automatic mapping tools have opened new horizons in Cartography, with a potential which should be taken advantage also in the study of landscapes and, particularly, of urban growth. From a morphological point of view, a study of urban expansion necessarily has to be based on <b>multitemporal</b> <b>mapping.</b> More than successive static pictures, <b>multitemporal</b> <b>mapping</b> produces a dynamic image of the process, providing support to ensuing explanatory studies. In Portugal, the studies on urban expansion are limited either by the reduced scale employed or by their reduced focus (studies of small areas or single cities). Increasingly in use, techniques based on the classification and/or interpretation of satellite images produce multitemporal cartography at much larger scale and coverage. However, these techniques have limitations, given their recent development: {{it is not possible to}} map built-up areas prior to 1980. The limitations in producing multitemporal urban cartography at regional and sub-regional scales could be mitigated by an approach integrating information from old editions of topographic mapping in a GIS, which could thus track the process of urban growth for a certain time frame. In this paper, this approach was employed to prepare a multitemporal cartographic database of built areas, with three moments comprising the {{second half of}} the 20 th century. These databases also served to produce a set of “morpho-densimetric” indicators related to built-up areas, for the three temporal moments, leading to analyses on the pace and forms of recent urbanization in the area under study (the Porto metropolis). We believe that the approach proposed can open new perspectives for cartographic production, as well as for the study and understanding of recent urbanization processes and its implications on the landscape dynamics...|$|R

40|$|The {{activities}} of selective logging have being intensified in the Amazon region. The Jamari National Forest (FLONA) {{is located in}} the North of the Rondônia State, Brazil, enclosing an area of 215000 ha. The FLONA is into an area of conflict against the region's lumber and also is the first area to the concessions otorged by the Brazilian Government. These facts motivated this work. The methodology was done with a dataset of 23 years of images Landsat-TM 5, CBERS- 2 and CBERS- 2 B from the study area. The application of the spectral mixing model and arithmetic operations of fractions images allowed the best visual interpretation to selective logging exploration. After the identification of the selective logging exploration areas, it was calculated an area of 395, 46 km 2 and found an average of 16, 47 km 2 /year. The frequency of the selective logging exploration was next to the damping area. Thus, a <b>multitemporal</b> <b>mapping</b> of the selective logging exploration in the study area was generated.

40|$|Simultaneously with an {{overflight}} of an {{area near}} the city of Nuernberg (FRG), performed with an imaging 11 -channel airborne scanner of type Daedalus AADS 1268 flying at 300 m altitude, ground reference measurements of the reflectance spectra were conducted with a spectrally high resolving spectraradiometer of type IRIS. Based on a method developed by [RICHTER 1994, HEPP 1994] reflectance images are calculated from the aerial raw data. The airborne scanner reflectance images are compared to the ground reference reflectance measurements. The comparison yields deviations up to 35 %. They can partially be explained by an inaccurate calibration of the airborne scanner. In addition, errors appear during calculation of the reflectances due to simplifying model assumptions and an inexact knowledge of the values of the model input parameters (experimental conditions). By comparison of the aerial reflectances to data taken in former years in the same area under comparable conditions, it can be shown that calibration of the airborne scanner with the ground reference measurements, instead with laboratory calibration, improves the results. When no ground reference reflectance measurements are available, especially for multitemporal comparisons, it still makes sense to calculate reflectances from the aerial data by simulations e. g. after [RICHTER 1994, HEPP 1994]. Thus, physical quantities of the surfaces are generated, which are independent of illumination and registration conditions. However, it is shown that calculation of reflectances from airborne measurements alone is not sufficient for a fully <b>automatic</b> <b>multitemporal</b> comparison. For this purpose, ground reference measurements or an improvement of the reflectances from scanner data are still necessary. (orig.)

40|$|The role {{of art in}} {{relation}} to maps is being reappraised {{on the basis of}} a perceived ability to depict aspects of a place that maps alone cannot. Many as opposed to one perspective on a place communicates more fully the essence of that place (with art as a valuable source of qualitative geospatial data) and so maps and art should be presented in the same visualization package. This paper outlines the development and implementation of an interface where a scanned painting forms the mode of access to <b>multitemporal</b> <b>maps.</b> The interface is used to represent the history and habitat extent of the kea (alpine parrot) in New Zealand from pre human colonization times through to their present, limited range to a speculation on their future habitat. The painting and the map (in what has been termed in the literature as an anti-map / map combination) are in their own separate layers and joined by an interactive link. The interface harnesses the ability of visual art to aggregate multiple themes, locations and times into a single cohesive image. The ability to contain many temporal instances is close to the comic strip frame (and instances of Renaissance art) in particular, with, in this case, an implicit time frame from left to right on the painting. The use of an artistic image minimizes use of text to depict events, due to the visual and narrative power of the painting. 1...|$|R

40|$|Remote sensing {{offers an}} {{objective}} and {{efficient way to}} monitor ecosystem properties including their spatial variability across different land cover types. Especially, the representation of gradients of biochemical and structural properties of ecosystems using continuous fields (CF) approaches bears advantages compared to discrete land cover classification schemes. This paper presents a concept to synergistically generate CF maps of an alpine ecosystem parameter, i. e., total surface water content, from imaging spectrometer (IS) data. Further, the potential of linking such maps to ecological patterns, i. e., the spatial distribution of large ungulates is being assessed. In vegetated areas, total surface water content is considered as a surrogate of plant physiological status. Water is, besides temperature, light, or nutrients, an important limiting growth factor determining biomass production and therefore potential animal forage quantity in alpine grasslands. Resource ecology interested in trophic interactions between large ungulates and their forage requires spatial and temporal information on ecosystem properties and processes. The study area {{is located in the}} upper Trupchun Valley (Val Trupchun) in the Swiss National Park (SNP). The valley is famous for its high densities of chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra L.), ibex (Capra ibex L.), and red deer (Cervus elaphus L.). CF maps of total surface water content were derived from Airborne Prism EXperiment (APEX) IS data collected over the SNP in June 2010 and 2011. Abundance maps of predominant land cover classes were derived from linear spectral mixture analysis (SMA). They were then combined with water content informa- tion of the respective land cover originating from either empirically or physically based approaches. The resulting CF maps depicted a spatially continuous representation of relative total surface water content. APEX IS data from two consecutive seasons revealed differences in total surface water content in June 2010 and 2011, predominantly related to an advanced phenological development in spring 2011 and to considerable differences in snow cover between the 2 years. Linking total surface water content of grasslands to observed ungulates spatial distributions did not reveal any statistically significant patterns of habitat use. We conclude that water availability in Val Trupchun may not be the dominant limiting factor for potential forage quantity (biomass), or that ungulates choose their grazing sites based on other criteria, i. e., high nutritious quality (P, N). Nevertheless, <b>multitemporal</b> CF <b>maps</b> derived from APEX IS data were found to provide spatially explicit and finescaled information for analyses of an ecosystem’s total surface water content.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} the new generation remote sensing satellite hyperspectral images provides an important data source for Earth Observation (EO). Hyperspectral images are characterized by a very detailed spectral sampling (i. e., very high spectral resolution) over a wide spectral wavelength range. This important property makes it possible the monitoring of the land-cover dynamic and environmental evolution at a fine spectral scale. This also allows one to potentially detect subtle spectral variations associated with the land-cover transitions that are usually not detectable in the traditional multispectral images due to their poor spectral signature representation (i. e., generally sufficient for representing only the major changes). To fully utilize the available multitemporal hyperspectral images and their rich information content, {{it is necessary to}} develop advanced techniques for robust change detection (CD) in multitemporal hyperspectral images, thus to automatically discover and identify the interesting and valuable change information. This is the main goal of this thesis. In the literature, most of the CD approaches were designed for multispectral images. The effectiveness of these approaches, to the complex CD problems is reduced, when dealing with the hyperspectral images. Accordingly, the research activities carried out during this PhD study and presented in this thesis are devoted to the development of effective methods for multiple change detection in multitemporal hyperspectral images. These methods consider the intrinsic properties of the hyperspectral data and overcome the drawbacks of the existing CD techniques. In particular, the following specific novel contributions are introduced in this thesis: 1) 	A theoretical and empirical analysis of the multiple-change detection problem in multitemporal hyperspectral images. Definition and discussion of concepts as the changes and of the change endmembers, the hierarchical change structure and the multitemporal spectral mixture is given. 2) 	A novel semi-automatic sequential technique for iteratively discovering, visualizing, and detecting multiple changes. Reliable change variables are adaptively generated for the representation of each specific considered change. Thus multiple changes are discovered and discriminated according to an iterative re-projection of the spectral change vectors into new compressed change representation domains. Moreover, a simple yet effective tool is developed allowing user to have an interaction within the CD procedure. 3) 	A novel partially-unsupervised hierarchical clustering technique for the separation and identification of multiple changes. By considering spectral variations at different processing levels, multiple change information is adaptively modelled and clustered according to spectral homogeneity. A manual initialization is used to drive the whole hierarchical clustering procedure; 4) 	A novel <b>automatic</b> <b>multitemporal</b> spectral unmixing approach to detect multiple changes in hyperspectral images. A multitemporal spectral mixture model is proposed to analyse the spectral variations at sub-pixel level, thus investigating in details the spectral composition of change and no-change endmembers within a pixel. A patch-scheme is used in the endmembers extraction and unmixing, which better considers endmember variability.

40|$|Vegetation and land-cover {{changes are}} not always {{directional}} but follow complex trajectories over space and time, driven by changing anthropogenic and abiotic conditions. We present a multi-observational approach to land-change analysis that addresses the complex geographic and temporal variability of vegetation changes related to climate and land use. Using land-ownership data {{as a proxy for}} land-use practices, <b>multitemporal</b> land-cover <b>maps,</b> and repeat photography dating to the late 19 th century, we examine changing spatial and temporal distributions of two vegetation types with high conservation value in the southwestern United States: grasslands and riparian vegetation. In contrast to many reported vegetation changes, notably shrub encroachment in desert grasslands, we found an overall increase in grassland area and decline of xeroriparian and riparian vegetation. These observed change patterns were neither temporally directional nor spatially uniform over the landscape. Historical data suggest that long-term vegetation changes coincide with broad climate fluctuations while fine-scale patterns are determined by land-management practices. In some cases, restoration and active management appear to weaken the effects of climate on vegetation; therefore, if land managers in this region act in accord with on-going directional changes, the current drought and associated ecological reorganization may provide an opportunity to achieve desired restoration endpoints...|$|R

Neither of the algorithms involves the procedure of interferometric phase unwrapping, thus excluding the areal error propagation and improving the modelling accuracy. In general, they remain feasible even under significant phase noise. An original gradient approach (GINSAR) to differential processing of repeat-pass SAR interferograms based on the calculation of interferometric phase gradients, the generation of glacier slope maps and the analysis of differences between <b>multitemporal</b> slope <b>maps</b> provides global and fast solutions to unsupervised glacier change detection and ice motion estimation.

The basic intent {{of the study was}} to evaluate the potential of the data set for broad‐scale, <b>multitemporal</b> landscape <b>mapping</b> by assessing the quality and sensitivity of the data set to support such applications. Potential biases existing in the data set were identified and analytical procedures suggested to deal with such biases. Results from analyses within the State of North Carolina suggest that the time series of the NDVI values is influenced by sensitivities to residual cloud contamination, preceeding climatic events, temporal and spatial scales of analyses, and the composition and spatial organization of the study area. Spatial and temporal discontinuities within and between images, irregular space‐time semivariograms, and statistical summaries of the data show the existence of biases in the data set for North Carolina. Possible adjustments to reduce this level of uncertainty include the generation of NDVI composites over longer time periods, exclusion of suspected contaminated data, or the use of spatial and temporal interpolations of contaminated values to reduce their relative impact on each composite image.

For regions with no or insufficient spatial and temporal coverage of meteorological ground measurements, MODIS derived AOT data are a valuable alternative, {{especially with regard to}} the dynamics of atmospheric conditions. In this study, {{atmospheric correction}} strategies were assessed based on the change in standard deviation (σ) compared to the raw data and also by machine learning landcover classification accuracies. For three Landsat 8 OLI (acquired in 2013) and two RapidEye (acquired in 2010 and 2014) scenes, seven different correction strategies were tested over an agricultural area in south-east Ireland. Visibility calculated from daily spatial averaged TERRA-MODIS estimates (1 ° × 1 ° Aerosol Product) served as input for the atmospheric correction. In almost all cases the standard deviation of the raw data is reduced after incorporation of terrain correction, compared to the atmospheric corrected data. ATCOR®-IDL based correction decreases the standard deviation almost consistently (ranging from - 0. 3 to - 26. 7). The 6 S implementation in GRASS GIS showed a tendency of increasing the variation in the data, especially for the RapidEye data. No major differences in overall accuracies and Kappa values were observed between the three machine learning classification approaches.

The interpretation script comes from the following operating procedures: an integrated analysis of the physiographic features of the watershed (geology, relief units, hypsometric, slope, soil conditions and ground cover and use), mapping of the landscape structure (landscape units); analysis of the dynamics of landscape units (<b>multitemporal</b> <b>mapping</b> of vegetation cover and land use from satellite images from 1984, 1994 and 2010); delimitation of areas of stability / instability of the physical environment, identifying capable areas for agricultural crops, pasture and forestry, as well as areas unsuitable for agricultural use; delimitation of areas of legal incompatibility, and finally preparing the mapping using the indicated capacity. Based on analysis of the physiographic features of the watershed, it was possible to identify six landscape units: Geosystem of Hills and Law Plateaus with Productive Activities, Geosystems of Law Plateaus and Hills With Urbanized Areas, Geosystems of Low Plateaus with Productive Activities, Geosystem of Low Plateaus with Urbanized Areas, Geosystem of the Capoeiras over Hills, Low Plateaus and Law Plateaus e Geosystem of the Flooded Rainforests in Floodplains. Looking through the instability, the Basin predominantly presents areas with significant levels of instability, especially geosystems that feature human deeds. In contrast, areas with more stable conditions are characterized by areas where is possible to see a denser vegetative substrate, located in the Geosystem of the Capoeiras over Hills, Law Plateaus and Low Plateaus and in Geosystem of the Flooded Rainforests in Floodplains. In the analysis of agricultural suitability of the Basin's landscapes, it was found that its larger portion enables the use of technological development for farming, artificial grazing and forestry. In addition to these, there are also unsuitable areas for agricultural activities. Finally, it was established seven areas of recommended use in accordance with the support capacity of the landscape units of Igarapé Moura Basin: agricultural technology, mechanized agriculture, urban area, preservation, priority preservation, conservation/sustainable use and priority recovery. Therefore, from these analyzes, a need of using technical and scientific levels in agricultural production in the Basin was found, aimed at improving the management of different forms of landscape units and the need of preservation of secondary vegetation cover through techniques aimed at sustainable development linked to forest maintenance, essential for the territorial planning of this area. O presente trabalho analisou as unidades de paisagem partir da análise foi possível delimitar seis unidades de paisagem: Geossistema dos Tabuleiros e Colinas com Atividades Produtivas, Geossistemas dos Tabuleiros e Colinas com Áreas Urbanizadas, Geossistemas dos Baixos Platôs com Atividades Produtivas, Geossistemas dos Baixos Platôs com Áreas Urbanizadas, Geossistema das Capoeiras sobre Colinas, Baixos Platôs e Tabuleiros e Geossistema das Florestas Ombrófilas Inundáveis em Planícies Aluviais. Do ponto de vista da instabilidade a Bacia apresenta, predominantemente, áreas com significativos índices de instabilidade, destacando os geossistemas que são caracterizados pela ação antrópica. Em contrapartidaGeossistema das Capoeiras sobre Colinas, Tabuleiros e Baixos Platôs e no Geossistema das Florestas Ombrófilas Inundáveis em Planícies Aluviais. Na análise da aptidão agrícola das paisagens da Bacia Hidrográfica, constatou-se que sua maior porção possibilita a utilização de desenvolvimento tecnológico para fins de lavoura, pastagem plantada e silvicultura.

Além disso, a necessidade de conservação da cobertura vegetal secundária a partir de técnicas que visem o desenvolvimento sustentável atrelado a manutenção da floresta, indispensável para o planejamento/ordenamento territorial dessa área...|$|R
40|$|Phymatotrichum {{root rot}} is a fungal disease {{with a host}} range that {{includes}} many economically important crops in the southwestern United States and Mexico. While it has been studied since the late nineteenth century, ecological relationships of the disease, particularly those related to its distribution and dispersal, are not understood. Combined ground radiance sampling and aerial photographic interpretation was employed to study the distribution of Phymatotrichum root rot in cotton. Radiometric ground sampling showed that diseased cotton has a characteristic spectral signature that is significantly different from healthy cotton at visible wavelengths. Micro-scale examination of distribution within fields utilized multitemporal photography, both within season (1983) and for four seasons (1979 - 1982), revealed that the disease spreads during a season, but is not recurrent in many cases between years. Meso-scale <b>mapping</b> employed <b>multitemporal</b> photography to <b>map</b> distribution during a four-year period. When compared to mapped soil units, these data revealed a significantly non-random relationship between the diseased areas of fields and fine-textured soil units that may be based on moisture-holding potential.

40|$|Sugarcane {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crops for Brazils economy. The increase in global demand for sugarcanes ethanol requires the conversion of areas of conventional crops in sugarcane cultivation areas, making it necessary to know the level of expansion of this culture. The CANASAT project is mapping sugarcane areas in South central Brazil, using visual interpretation to generate sugarcane cultivation maps. The use of automatic classifiers must be improved, searching for new alternatives for mapping sugarcane. This study aimed to apply automatic classifiers for mapping areas of sugarcane in the city of Barretos-SP, comparing the performance of these classifiers with the map of CANASAT project for this municipality. We tested the classifiers Isoseg and Bhattacharya, and the GIS used was SPRING 4. 3. 3. Comparing the two classifiers evaluated, Bhattacharya achieved the best results, with a Kappa index of 0. 47, which is considered good, while the Isoseg was considered reasonable. The sugarcane areas that were at maximum vigor were classified correctly, but in areas at the beginning of vegetative cycle, after harvest or in reform generated errors of omission and inclusion, what shows the need of <b>multitemporal</b> analysis for <b>mapping</b> sugarcane. However, the classification based on visual interpretation still shows up the most appropriate way to do this mapping. Pages: 89 - 9...|$|R
40|$|Remote sensing {{can play}} a key role in risk {{assessment}} and management, especially when several concurrent factors coexist, such as a predisposition to natural disasters and the urban sprawl, spreading over highly vulnerable areas. In this context, multitemporal analysis can provide decision-makers with tools and information to reduce the impacts of disasters (e. g. flooding) and to encourage a sustainable development. The present work focuses on the employment of multispectral satellite imagery to produce <b>multitemporal</b> land use/cover <b>maps</b> for the city of Dhaka, which is subject to frequent flooding events. In particular, the evaluation of the urban growth, the analysis of the annual dynamics of flooding and the study of the 2004 catastrophic event were performed. For the change-detection procedure, Landsat images were used. These images allow the quantification of the very rapid growth of the metropolis, with an increase in built-up areas from 75 to 111  km 2. The image of 2009 showed that an ordinary flood affects about 115  km 2 (on a studied area of 591  km 2). On the other hand, the analysis of the 2004 extreme flooding event, performed on a wider area, showed that the affected lands added up to 750  km 2 (on about 3845  km 2) ...|$|R
40|$|A <b>multitemporal</b> {{method to}} <b>map</b> snow cover in mountainous terrain is {{proposed}} to guide Landsat climate data record (CDR) development. The Landsat image archive including MSS, TM, and ETM+ imagery {{was used to}} construct a prototype Landsat snow cover CDR for the interior northwestern United States. Landsat snow cover CDRs are designed to capture snow-covered area (SCA) variability at discrete bi-monthly intervals that correspond to ground-based snow telemetry (SNOTEL) snow-water-equivalent (SWE) measurements. The June 1 bi-monthly interval was selected for initial CDR development, and was based on peak snowmelt timing for this mountainous region. Fifty-four Landsat images from 1975 to 2011 were preprocessed that included image registration, top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance conversion, cloud and shadow masking, and topographic normalization. Snow covered pixels were retrieved using the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) and unsupervised classification, and pixels having greater (less) than 50 % snow cover were classified presence (absence). A normalized SCA equation was derived to independently estimate SCA given missing image coverage and cloud-shadow contamination. Relative frequency maps of missing pixels were assembled to assess whether systematic biases were embedded within this Landsat CDR. Our results {{suggest that it is}} possible to confidently estimate historical bi-monthly SCA from partially cloudy Landsat images. This multitemporal method is intended to guide Landsat CDR development for freshwaterscarce regions of the western US to monitor climate-driven changes in mountain snowpack extent...|$|R
40|$|The use of satellite-derived {{classification}} maps {{to improve}} post-stratified forest parameter estimates is well established. When reducing {{the variance of}} post-stratification estimates for forest change parameters such as forest growth, it is logical to use a change-related strata map. At the stand level, a time series of Landsat images is ideally suited for producing such a map. In this study, we generate strata maps based on trajectories of Landsat Thematic Mapper-based normalized difference vegetation index values, {{with a focus on}} post-disturbance recovery and recent measurements. These trajectories, from 1985 to 2010, are converted to harmonic regression coefficient estimates and classified according to a hierarchical clustering algorithm from a training sample. The resulting strata maps are then used in conjunction with measured plots to estimate forest status and change parameters in an Alabama, USA study area. These estimates and the variance of the estimates are then used to calculate the estimated relative efficiencies of the post-stratified estimates. Estimated relative efficiencies around or above 1. 2 were observed for total growth, total mortality, and total removals, with different strata maps being more effective for each. Possible avenues for improvement of the approach include the following: (1) enlarging the study area and (2) using the Landsat images closest to the time of measurement for each plot. <b>Multitemporal</b> satellite-derived strata <b>maps</b> show promise for improving the precision of change parameter estimates...|$|R

The related work aimed at <b>mapping</b> <b>multitemporal</b> of the various forms of use and occupancy of the lagoon of Messejana, located in the neighborhood of the same name, in the south of Fortaleza, belonging to the sub-basin B- 5 of the River Coco. Parallels and comparisons were performed on a floor plant of the year 1970 of the lagoon of Messejana, through the use of digital mapping and orthophoto of the decades of 1990 and 2000 using the vectorization process, with the purpose of considering the growing urban area in around this source, and its consequent environmental degradation. The use of geo-tecnologies, through the GIS programs, like ArcView 3. 2 and ArcGIS 9. 3, was essential for the preparation of figures and maps, allowing a good result in this research. Therefore, the work provides a larger observation of several changes in this space, both in time scale and space. Conclude the comparative analysis of the degradation of the lagoon of Messejana comes as a warning to the total disregard of the environmental regulations, and as an appeal to various governments about the need for decisions and measures that offer improvements geoenvironmental, economic and social consequences for the use and occupation of this urban lagoon.

40|$|The Upper Orcia Valley (Southern Tuscany, Italy) {{is a key}} {{site for}} the {{comprehension}} of denudation processes typically acting in Mediterranean badlands (calanchi) areas, thanks to the availability of long-lasting erosion monitoring datasets and the rapidity of erosion processes development. These features make the area suitable as an open air laboratory {{for the study of}} badlands dynamic and changes in geoheritage due to erosion (i. e. active geomorphosites). Decadal multitemporal investigations on the erosion rates and the geomorphological dynamics of the study area allowed to highlight a decrease in the average water erosion rates during the last 60 years. More in detail, a reduction of bare land and, consequently, of erosion processes effectiveness and a contemporary increasing frequency of mass wasting events were recorded. These trends can be partly related to the land cover changes occurred in the study area from the 1950 s onwards, which consist of the significant increase of reforestation practices and important other forms of human impacts on slopes, mainly land levelling for agricultural exploitation. In order to better identify the most significant phases of geomorphological instability occurred in this area during the last decades, an integrated approach based on <b>multitemporal</b> geomorphological <b>mapping</b> and dendrogeomorphology analysis on specimen of Pinus nigra Arn. was used. In detail, trees colonizing a denudation slope located in the surrounding of the Radicofani town (Tuscany, Italy) and characterized by calanchi and shallow mass movements deposits, were analyzed for the 1985 - 2012 time period. The analysis of the growth anomaly indexes and of compression wood allowed to determine a spatio-temporal differentiation along the slope and respect to an undisturbed reference site. The negative anomaly index results to be more pronounced in the trees located on the investigated slope with respect to the ones sampled in a non-disturbed area. Compression wood characterizes trees on slope sectors mainly affected by runoff and/or mass movements with a different persistence. Erosion rates were finally calculated through dendrogeomorphological analysis on tree roots exposure (0. 31 - 3 cm/y runoff prevailing; 5. 86 - 27. 5 cm/y, mass movements prevailing). Dendrogeomorphological results are in accordance with those obtained in the investigated areas with multitemporal photogrammetric and geomorphologic analyses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Rice {{agriculture}} {{is an important}} crop that influences land-atmosphere interactions and requires substantial resources for flood management. Multitemporal acquisition strategies pro-vide an opportunity to improve rice mapping and monitoring of hydroperiod. The objectives {{of this study were}} to 1) delineate rice paddies with Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) fine-beam single/dual (FBS/D) mode measurements and 2) integrate multitemporal, ScanSAR Wide-Beam 1 (WB 1) -and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) -observations for flood frequency <b>mapping.</b> <b>Multitemporal</b> and multiscale PALSAR and MODIS imagery were collected over the study region in the Sacramento Valley, California, USA. A deci-sion-tree approach utilized multitemporal FBS (HH polarization) data to classify rice fields and WB 1 measurements to assess paddy flood status. High temporal frequency MODIS products further characterized hydroperiod for each individual rice paddy using a relationship between the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI). Validation found the PALSAR-derived rice paddy extent maps and hydroperiod products to possess very high overall accuracies (95 % overall ac-curacy). Agreement between MODIS and PALSAR flood products was strong with agreement between 85 – 94 % at four comparison dates. By using complementing products and the strengths of each instrument, image acquisition strategies and monitoring protocol can be enhanced. The results highlight how the integration of multitemporal PALSAR and MODIS can be used to generate valuable agro-ecological information products in an operational context.

40|$|Abstract—A {{land cover}} {{classification}} service is introduced toward addressing current challenges on the handling and online processing of big remote sensing data. The geospatial web {{service has been}} designed, developed, and evaluated toward the efficient and automated classification of satellite imagery and the produc-tion of high-resolution land cover maps. The core of our platform consists of the Rasdaman array database management system for raster data storage and the open geospatial consortium web cov-erage processing service for data querying. Currently, the system is fully covering Greece with Landsat 8 multispectral imagery, {{from the beginning of}} its operational orbit. Datasets are stored and preprocessed automatically. A two-stage automated classification procedure was developed which is based on a statistical learning model and a multiclass support vector machine classifier, integrat-ing advanced remote sensing and computer vision tools like Orfeo Toolbox and OpenCV. The framework has been trained to clas-sify pansharpened images at 15 -m ground resolution toward the initial detection of 31 spectral classes. The final product of our sys-tem is delivering, after a postclassification and merging procedure, <b>multitemporal</b> land cover <b>maps</b> with 10 land cover classes. The performed intensive quantitative evaluation has indicated an over-all classification accuracy above 80 %. The system in its current alpha release, once receiving a request from the client, can process and deliver land cover maps, for a 500 -km 2 region, in about 20 s, allowing near real-time applications.
