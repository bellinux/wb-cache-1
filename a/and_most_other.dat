5|$|Tyrannosaurus, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> theropods, {{probably}} primarily processed carcasses with lateral shakes of the head, like crocodilians. The {{head was}} not as maneuverable as the skulls of allosauroids, due to flat joints of the neck vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} most prestigious reviewers ignored the book, leaving it to book trade and library {{publications}} such as Kirkus Reviews and Booklist, which examined it only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction. However, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by Cooperative Children's Book Center Choices, which pointed out the complexity, depth and consistency of the world Rowling had built) {{attracted the attention of}} reviewers in major newspapers. Although The Boston Globe and Michael Winerip in The New York Times complained that the final chapters were the weakest part of the book, they <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> American reviewers gave glowing praise.|$|E

5|$|Bacteria {{can also}} be used in the place of {{pesticides}} in the biological pest control. This commonly involves Bacillus thuringiensis (also called BT), a gram-positive, soil dwelling bacterium. Subspecies of this bacteria are used as a Lepidopteran-specific insecticides under trade names such as Dipel and Thuricide. Because of their specificity, these pesticides are regarded as environmentally friendly, with little or no effect on humans, wildlife, pollinators <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> beneficial insects.|$|E
5|$|Because {{she is a}} whale <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> {{characters}} are small tide pool organisms, Pearl is depicted as extraordinarily tall and heavy. Her size {{compared to the other}} characters is often used for visual gags; for example, she is able to shake the entire Krusty Krab when she jumps and can fill the entire building with tears when she cries. The floors of the Krabs' residence are equipped with drain plugs so the house can be emptied after Pearl cries or spouts water from her blowhole.|$|E
5|$|Bundy's only {{significant}} athletic avocation was snow skiing, which he pursued enthusiastically using stolen equipment and forged lift tickets. During high school {{he was arrested}} at least twice on suspicion of burglary and auto theft. When he reached age 18 {{the details of the}} incidents were expunged from his record, as is customary in Washington <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> states.|$|E

50|$|Ambelau (Bahasa Ambelau) is an Austronesian language; in 1989, it was {{spoken by}} about 5,700 Ambelau people, of whom more than 5,000 {{lived on the}} Indonesian island Ambelau (Pulau Ambelau) <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>others</b> in the village Wae Tawa of the nearby island Buru (Pulau Buru).|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1970s, Philly soul, funk, rock <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> genres were {{dominated}} by disco-inflected tracks. During this period, funk bands like The O'Jays and The Spinners continued to turn out hits. After the death of disco in 1980, soul music survived for a short time before going through yet another metamorphosis. With the introduction of influences from electro music and funk, soul music became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a genre of music that was again called R, usually distinguished from the earlier rhythm and blues by identifying it as contemporary R.|$|E
5|$|Californium-249 {{is formed}} from the beta decay of berkelium-249, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> {{californium}} isotopes {{are made by}} subjecting berkelium to intense neutron radiation in a nuclear reactor. Although californium-251 has the longest half-life, its production yield is only 10% due to its tendency to collect neutrons (high neutron capture) and its tendency to interact with other particles (high neutron cross-section).|$|E
5|$|Consonant {{clusters}} across syllable boundaries do not assimilate {{for place}} in Wagiman {{as they do}} in many other languages. This means that a nasal in a syllable coda will not move to the position of the following syllable onset for ease of enunciation. In English <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> Indo-European languages, this movement occurs regularly, such that the prefix -in, for example, changes to -im when it precedes either a p, a b or an m.|$|E
50|$|Isomaltulose is an {{available}} carbohydrate like sucrose <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>others</b> sugars or maltodextrins. Available or “nutritive” carbohydrates {{serve the}} body {{as a source of}} energy for its physiological functions. Whether a carbohydrate becomes available to the body largely depends on its digestion, absorption, and metabolism.|$|R
50|$|While {{many other}} papers were being {{published}} in early Macon, {{at least five}} were absorbed into The Telegraph <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>others</b> folded. However, in 1884, a teenaged Telegraph employee spent $8 and founded The Macon Evening News, which would eventually compete with the older, morning paper for readers.|$|R

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the Eighth National Congress, held in September 1956, Peng attended a Politburo committee to redraft the new Party Constitution.

Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, Peng Zhen, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> senior CCP members present quickly agreed, and it {{was removed from the}} final version of the 1956 Party Constitution. At the Congress, Peng was re-appointed to the Politburo and as a full member of the Central Committee.|$|E

Injection moulding {{is the most common}} modern method of manufacturing plastic parts; it is ideal for producing high volumes of the same object.|$|E

5|$|Most large {{objects in}} orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic. The planets {{are very close to}} the ecliptic, whereas comets and Kuiper belt objects are {{frequently}} at significantly greater angles to it. All the planets, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> objects, orbit the Sun in the same direction that the Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole). There are exceptions, such as Halley's Comet.|$|E
5|$|Seara disappeared, {{together}} with Minerva, Libertatea, Steagul <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> Germanophile papers, {{in late summer}} 1916, shortly after Romania declared war on the Central Powers. When the German and Austrian troops invaded southern Romania, forcing the Ententist government to flee for Iași, some of Searas former staff remained in Bucharest and chose the path of collaborationism. This was notably pursued by Arghezi, Galaction, Bărbulescu and Karnabatt, all of whom wrote for the propaganda tribune Gazeta Bucureștilor. According to popular rumors, Bogdan-Pitești fell out of favor with the occupiers, who eventually discovered {{that he had been}} squandering their grants.|$|E
5|$|South Park was {{the first}} weekly program to be rated TV-MA rating, and is {{generally}} intended for adult audiences. The boys <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> child characters use strong profanity, with only the most taboo words being bleeped during a typical broadcast. According to Parker and Stone, when little boys are alone, that's how they really talk.|$|E
50|$|Mainstream Tasawwuf {{does not}} present {{itself as a}} {{separate}} set of beliefs from the mainstream Sunni tradition; well-established traditions like Naqshbandi, Qadiri, Shadhili, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>others</b> have always been {{part and parcel of}} normative Islamic life.
