Each chromosome contains a double helix of DNA, and each DNA strand is a polymer made up of nucleotides (or bases). Four dierent kinds of bases, denoted A, C, G and T, occur.

In the bundle with the most favorable energy, all pairs of neighboring helices are oriented antiparallel [...] i. e., in the orientation that is favored by electrostatic interactions between the helices. In this structure, the orientation angle between neighboring helix axes is - 168 degrees, within +/- 7 degrees, in close agreement with the orientation angles observed in proteins and with the value that we computed earlier for the most favorable packing of pairs of interacting alpha-helices. This orientation corresponds to a left-handed twisting of the helical bundle. The preferred handedness of this twisting arises as a result of favorable nonbonded interactions between the alpha-helices...|$|R

Hyperthermia: Placing superparamagnetic {{iron oxide}} in {{altering}} current [AC] magnetic fields randomly flips the magnetization direction between the parallel and <b>antiparallel</b> <b>orientations,</b> allowing {{the transfer of}} magnetic energy to the particles {{in the form of}} heat, a property {{that can be used in}} vivo to increase the temperature of tumor tissues to destroy the pathological cells by hyperthermia. Tumor cells are more sensitive to a temperature increase than healthy ones [72, 73]. In past studies, magnetite cationic liposomal nanoparticles and dextran-coated magnetite [74] have been shown to effectively increase the temperature of tumor cells for hyperthermia treatment in cell irradiation. This has been proposed to be one of the key approaches to successful cancer therapy in the future [75]. The advantage of magnetic hyperthermia is that it allows the heating to be restricted to the tumor area. Moreover, the use of subdomain magnetic particles (nanometer-sized) is preferred instead multidomain (micron-sized) particles because nanoparticles absorb much more power at tolerable AC magnetic fields [76, 77] which is strongly dependent on the particle size and shape, and thus, having well-defined synthetic routes able to produce uniform particles is essential for a rigorous control in temperature.|$|R

The polarization asymmetry for transverse polarization, P, assumes a scaling form in the deep inelastic scattering region, and should go to zero as ω- 1 for large ω. The latter behavior is connected, through the use of the improved scaling variable ωs, with the high energy real photon situation. A sum rule is exhibited which implies that P must change sign in the deep inelastic region. This sum rule also yields the known Drell-Hearn sum rule for real photon Compton scattering, when combined with another, new, sum rule for the anomalous magnetic moment. The latter is verified in the context of pure electrodynamics to the lowest order in α.

The resulting cyclohexanyl nucleic acids (CNAs) represent a new enantioselective Watson-Crick base-pairing system. Homochiral oligomers of equivalent chirality show Watson-Crick pairing, while those of opposite chirality (D-CNA and L-CNA) do not.

40|$|SummaryThe {{segregation}} of genetic material during mitosis is coordinated by the mitotic spindle, whose action {{depends upon the}} polarity patterns of its microtubules (MTs) [1, 2]. Homotetrameric mitotic kinesin- 5 motors can crosslink and slide adjacent spindle MTs [3 – 11], but it is unknown whether they or other motors contribute to establishing these MT polarity patterns. Here, we explored whether the Drosophila embryo kinesin- 5 KLP 61 F, which plausibly crosslinks both parallel and antiparallel MTs [7, 12], displays a preference for parallel or antiparallel MT orientation. In motility assays, KLP 61 F was observed to crosslink and slide adjacent MTs, as predicted. Remarkably, KLP 61 F displayed a 3 -fold higher preference for crosslinking MTs in the <b>antiparallel</b> <b>orientation.</b> This polarity preference was observed {{in the presence of}} ADP or ATP plus AMPPNP, but not AMPPNP alone, which induces instantaneous rigor binding. Also, a purified motorless tetramer containing the C-terminal tail domains displayed an <b>antiparallel</b> <b>orientation</b> preference, confirming that motor activity is not required. The results suggest that, during morphogenesis of the Drosophila embryo mitotic spindle, KLP 61 F's crosslinking and sliding activities could facilitate the gradual accumulation of KLP 61 F within antiparallel interpolar MTs at the equator, where the motor could generate force to drive poleward flux and pole-pole separation...|$|E
40|$|The archetypical {{member of}} the small multidrug-resistance family is EmrE, a multidrug {{transporter}} that extrudes toxic polyaromatic cations from the cell coupled to the inward movement of protons down a concentration gradient. The architecture of EmrE was first defined from the analysis of two-dimensional crystals by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), which showed that EmrE was an unusual asymmetric dimer formed from a bundle of eight-helices. The most favoured interpretation of the structure was that the monomers were oriented in opposite orientations in the membrane in an <b>antiparallel</b> <b>orientation.</b> A model was subsequently built based upon the cryo-EM data and evolutionary constraints and this model was consistent with mutagenic data indicating which amino-acid residues were important for substrate binding and transport. Two X-ray structures that differed significantly from the cryo-EM structure were subsequently retracted owing to a data-analysis error. However, the revised X-ray structure with substrate bound is extremely similar to the model built from the cryo-EM structure (r. m. s. d. of 1. 4 A ˚), suggesting that the proposed <b>antiparallel</b> <b>orientation</b> of the monomers is indeed correct; this represents a new structural paradigm in membrane-protein structures.

40|$|Homomeric coiled-coils can self-assemble into a {{wide range}} of {{structural}} states with different helix topologies and oligomeric states. In this study, we have combined de novo structure modeling with stability calculations to simultaneously predict structure and oligomeric states of homomeric coiled-coils. For dimers an asymmetric modeling protocol was developed. Modeling without symmetry constraints showed that backbone asymmetry is important for the formation of parallel dimeric coiled-coils. Collectively, our results demonstrate that high-resolution structure of coiled-coils, as well as parallel and <b>antiparallel</b> <b>orientations</b> of dimers and tetramers, can be accurately predicted from sequence. De novo modeling was also used to generate models of competing oligomeric states, which were used to compare stabilities and thus predict the native stoichiometry from sequence. In a benchmark set of 33 coiled-coil sequences, forming dimers to pentamers, up to 70 % of the oligomeric states could be correctly predicted. The calculations demonstrated that the free energy of helix folding could be an important factor for determining stability and oligomeric state of homomeric coiled-coils. The computational methods developed here should be broadly applicable to studies of sequence-structure relationships in coiled-coils and the design of higher order assemblies with improved oligomerization specificity.

40|$|Interactions between {{naturally}} occurring proteins are highly specific, with protein-network imbalances associated with numerous diseases. For designed protein-protein interactions (PPIs), required specificity can be notoriously difficult to engineer. To accelerate this process we have derived peptides that form heterospecific PPIs when combined. This is achieved using software that generates large virtual libraries of peptide sequences and searches within the resulting interactome for preferentially interacting peptides. To demonstrate feasibility we have i) generated 1536 peptide sequences {{based on the}} parallel dimeric coiled coil motif and varied residues known to be important for stability and specificity ii) screened the 1, 180, 416 member interactome for predicted Tm values and iii) used predicted Tm cut-off points to isolate eight peptides which form four heterospecific PPIs when combined. This required that all 32 hypothetical off-target interactions within the eight-peptide interactome be disfavoured and that the four desired interactions pair correctly. Lastly, we have verified the approach by characterising all 36 pairs within the interactome. In analysing the output we hypothesised that several sequences are capable of adopting <b>antiparallel</b> <b>orientations.</b> We subsequently improved the software by removing sequences where doing so led to fully complementary electrostatic pairings.
