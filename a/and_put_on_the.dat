25|$|The LCP has {{continued}} to be controversial. Many witnesses have testified that elderly patients were admitted to hospital for emergency treatment <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> LCP without documented proof that the patient consented to it, or could not recover from their health problem; 48-year-old Norfolk man Andrew Flanagan was revived by his family and went home for a further five weeks after doctors {{put him on the}} LCP. The Royal College of Physicians found that up to half of families were not informed of clinicians’ decision to put a relative on the pathway.|$|E
25|$|P. snelleni {{exists in}} {{temperate}} locations, where cold and hot weather conditions can arise. When the temperature becomes hot, as it often does in Japan {{during the summer}} months when the P. snelleni nests are in existence, the paper wasps need to take measures to cool down the nest. Water transport to the nest occurs after the appearance of larvae, and once it starts, it occurs about 10-15 times in succession. Water drops are carried by the wasps <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> concave nest roof. This aids in cooling the nest. When there is shade over the nest, the wasps move the water and throw it away.|$|E
25|$|The first South Stand {{was first}} built at Olive Grove, but moved {{with the club}} {{in the summer of}} 1899 to the new site at Owlerton where it was rebuilt brick by brick. The famous clock was also moved to Hillsborough. The modern stand, the oldest {{remaining}} stand at the ground, was built between 1913 and 1915 for a fee exceeding £17,000 to a design by Archibald Leitch. The stand had 5,600 seats as well as room for 11,000 standing fans. The famous clock was salvaged from the old stand <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> new one. The modern stand has seen a series of improvements, the first being a conversion to an all-seated stand in 1965 ahead of the 1966 FIFA World Cup and latest being a major £7million re-development for the Euro 1996 international competition when an upper tier (Grandstand) of 3,077 extra seats, a new roof, 30 executive boxes, two conference suites, a bar, a restaurant and a range of office space were added. Again, the famous clock was saved <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> new stand. The South Stand is the most recognisable of the four stands at Hillsborough and still bears the original now-famous and easily recognisable clock face and finial from the very first stand, which was brought from Olive Grove. The stand houses the main reception, media and hospitality boxes, Press box, Television gantry, as well as the ground's family enclosure, five modern refreshment kiosks and four bars. It also features concourse television sets relaying live coverage of the match as well as highlights at half-time. The team changing room and dug-outs are also situated here.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{cryptography}} {{is legal}} for domestic use, {{but there has}} been much conflict over legal issues related to cryptography. One particularly important issue has been the export of cryptography and cryptographic software and hardware. Probably because of the importance of cryptanalysis in World War II and an expectation that cryptography would continue to be important for national security, many Western governments have, at some point, strictly regulated export of cryptography. After World War II, it was illegal in the US to sell or distribute encryption technology overseas; in fact, encryption was designated as auxiliary military equipment <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> United States Munitions List. Until the development of the personal computer, asymmetric key algorithms (i.e., public key techniques), and the Internet, this was not especially problematic. However, as the Internet grew and computers became more widely available, high-quality encryption techniques became well known around the globe.|$|E
25|$|Nabokov next joined Russia for the 2008 IIHF World Championship, {{arriving}} {{after the}} Sharks were eliminated in the NHL playoffs.

The starting goalie for Russia at the 2010 Winter Olympics, Nabokov helped Russia reach the quarterfinals against Canada. However he allowed four goals {{in the first period}} and was subsequently pulled, with Russia ultimately losing 7–3. Nabokov finished the Olympics with a record of two wins and one loss as the Russians placed sixth overall. His final appearance in an international tournament was at the 2011 IIHF World Championship. Nabokov played four games for Russia, winning two and losing one, before a groin injury forced him to leave the tournament; Russia would finish fourth.|$|E
25|$|Boys {{and girls}} of citizen family wore amulets {{to protect them}} from immoral or baleful {{influences}} such as the evil eye and sexual predation. For boys, the amulet was a bulla, worn around the neck; the equivalent for girls was a crescent-shaped lunula. The toga praetexta, which was thought to offer similar apotropaic protection, was formal wear for freeborn boys until puberty, usually around 14 years of age, when they gave their toga praetexta and childhood bulla into the care of their family lares <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> adult male's toga virilis. According to some Roman literary sources, freeborn girls might also wear - or at least, had the right to wear - a toga praetexta until marriage, when they offered their childhood toys, and perhaps their maidenly praetexta to Fortuna Virginalis; others claim a gift made to the family Lares, or to Venus, as part of their passage to adulthood. In traditionalist families, unmarried girls might be expected to wear their hair demurely bound in a fillet.|$|E

25|$|By 0700 on 17 December 1944, Peiper's Kampfgruppe {{had seized}} the American fuel dump at Büllingen. At 1330 that same day, at a {{crossroads}} near Malmedy, men from Peiper's LSSAH formation shot and killed at least 68 United States POWs, in {{what became known as}} the Malmedy massacre. By the evening of 17 December, the leading element of the LSSAH was engaged with the 99th US Division at Stavelot. Mohnke's division was behind schedule by at least 36 hours by the end of the second day. The retreating U.S. troops blew up important bridges and fuel dumps that Mohnke and Peiper had counted on taking intact, further slowing the German advance. With each passing day, enemy resistance stiffened and by 24 December the advance was halted. On 1 January 1945, the Luftwaffe launched a series of attacks on Allied airfields but the operation was very costly for the Germans. They suffered losses which could not be replaced. By this time, the Allies had regrouped their forces and were ready to repulse any attacks launched by the Germans. The operation formally ended on 27 January 1945, and three days later Mohnke was promoted to SS-Brigadeführer. A short time later the LSSAH and I SS Panzer Corps were transferred to Hungary to try and bolster the crumbling situation there. Mohnke was injured in an air raid where he suffered, among other things, ear damage. He was removed from front-line service <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Führer reserve.|$|E
500|$|In Only You, Dick Daring!, his humorous yet damning {{account of}} the {{five and a half}} months he spent trying to make a show with CBS for the 1963–64 season based on an idea of Aubrey's about a county agent, writer Merle Miller {{described}} how Aubrey would simply walk out of meetings without offering any substantive comments on Miller's program and the nineteen rewrites he did of the pilot episode. Miller was assured by other CBS executives that Aubrey's silence meant things were fine– Kempton quoted a CBS producer telling Miller [...] "this {{has nothing to do with}} a good script or a bad script. It has to do with pleasing one man, Jim Aubrey. Don't ever forget it"– and Miller later learned of efforts by Aubrey to force him out. (A pilot for the show, known as Calhoun and County Agent, to star Jackie Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck, was shot <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fall schedule, but the series was canceled before it ever aired.) Miller quoted an independent producer: [...] "Aubrey's the most important man in television, in the history of television, maybe in the history of entertainment. He out-Mayers Louis B. Mayer ten times over." ...|$|E
500|$|Gerald Samuel Lesser (August 22, 1926 – September 23, 2010) was an American {{psychologist}} {{who served on}} the faculty of Harvard University from 1963 until his retirement in 1998. [...] Lesser was one of the chief advisers to the Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later known as the Sesame Workshop) in the development and content of the educational programming included in the children's television program Sesame Street. [...] At Harvard, he was chair of the university's Human Development Program for 20 years, which focused on cross-cultural studies of child rearing, and studied the effects of media on young children.

[...] He died in 2010, at the age of eighty-four, and was survived by his wife, a daughter, a son, and a grandchild.|$|E
