5|$|Despite early {{interest}} in the theatre, Joyce published only one play, Exiles, begun shortly after {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in 1914 and published in 1918. A study of <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> and wife relationship, the play looks back to The Dead (the final story in Dubliners) and forward to Ulysses, which Joyce began {{around the time of the}} play's composition.|$|E
5|$|Fulk {{returned}} to Antioch when Zengi dispatched Sawar, governor of Aleppo, {{to invade the}} principality in 1132 or 1133. After defeating the invaders, Fulk entered Antioch. Since the principality needed a firm government, the Antiochene noblemen approached Fulk to select <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> for Constance. He chose Raymond of Poitiers, the younger son of William IX, Duke of Aquitaine. He did not announce his decision in public {{because he wanted to}} prevent Alice and RogerII of Sicily from intervening.|$|E

5|$|He {{passed laws}} to protect prostitutes from {{exploitation}} {{and women from}} being forced into prostitution. Rapists were treated severely.

5|$|His {{wife was}} the target of an {{attempted}} assassination in Tucson, Arizona, on January 8, 2011.

5|$|In 2006, Winehouse {{admitted}} to punching a female fan {{in the face}} for criticising her having taken Blake Fielder-Civil as <b>a</b> <b>husband.</b> She then attacked her own spouse as he attempted to calm her down. In October 2007, Winehouse and Fielder-Civil were arrested in Bergen, Norway, for possession of seven grams of cannabis. The couple were later released and fined 3850 kroner (around Â£350). Winehouse first appealed the fines, but later dropped the appeal.|$|E

5|$|In 2010 a cable series prequel to Battlestar Galactica was {{introduced}} titled Caprica. The series highlighted {{a world in}} which same-sex marriage was common.

5|$|In 2014, an Indian {{family court}} in Mumbai ruled that <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> objecting {{to his wife}} wearing a kurta and jeans and forcing her to wear a sari amounts to cruelty inflicted by the husband and can be a ground to seek divorce. The wife was thus granted a divorce on the ground of cruelty as defined under section 27(1)(d) of Special Marriage Act, 1954.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, the Catholic Church opposes {{in vitro}} {{fertilisation}} (IVF), saying that the artificial process replaces the love between <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> and wife. In addition, it opposes IVF because it might cause disposal of embryos; Catholics believe an embryo is an individual with a soul who must be treated as such. For this reason, the church also opposes abortion.|$|E

50|$|A subplot {{involves}} the abortive courtship of Mrs. Prime by her pastor, Samuel Prong. Prong is a zealous but intolerant Evangelical. His religious beliefs {{are in agreement}} with hers, but the two have incompatible notions of marriage: Prong insists on <b>a</b> <b>husband's</b> authority over his wife, and in particular over the income from her first husband's estate; Mrs. Prime wants to retain control of her money, and is otherwise unwilling to submit to <b>a</b> <b>husband's</b> rule.|$|R
5|$|Abhishek Bachchan, John Abraham and Priyanka Chopra {{were cast}} in the lead roles. Aishwarya Rai was {{originally}} offered the lead role, but she refused it {{because she did not}} want to end up with another man in her first film with her husband (Bachchan) after their marriage. After Dostana release, she regretted the decision. Saif Ali Khan refused the role of Kunal because he was uncomfortable with <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> and wife (Bachchan and Rai) playing the other two leads. In early April 2008, Shilpa Shetty was signed for a special appearance in one of the film's songs.|$|E
5|$|At age 37, Mary {{turned her}} {{attention}} to finding <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> and producing an heir, which would prevent the Protestant Elizabeth (still next-in-line under the terms of Henry VIII's will and the Act of Succession of 1544) from succeeding to the throne. Edward Courtenay and Reginald Pole were both mentioned as prospective suitors, but her cousin Charles V suggested she marry his only son, Prince Philip of Spain. Philip had a son from a previous marriage and was heir apparent to vast territories in Continental Europe and the New World. As part of the marriage negotiations, a portrait of Philip, by Titian, was sent to her in September 1553.|$|E
5|$|Chakrapani {{decided to}} retain only the {{background}} of Gundamma's family from the original and rewrote the remaining script, taking inspiration from William Shakespeare comedy, The Taming of the Shrew. Chakrapani killed the character of Gundamma's cowardly husband because he felt that <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> who cannot answer his wife's questions is not eligible to be included. Kamalakara Kameswara Rao was chosen to direct the film. Chakrapani named the central character Gundamma in the remake {{after one of the}} characters in the original, despite a lack of nativity. Nagi Reddy's family members and the employees of the Vijaya Vauhini Studios used to ask him Gundamma Katha Entha varaku vachchindi? ("What is the progress in Gundamma's story?"), which prompted Nagi Reddy to title the film Gundamma Katha after considering various options.|$|E

Bauer was not sufficiently established an artist to provide for a family; throughout his entire lifetime he relied on his parents for financial support. When he proposed to Ellqvist, Bauer did so without the approval of his parents, who thought that he should be more established in a career and self-supporting before marriage.|$|E
5|$|Epaminondas was {{considered}} the greatest warrior-statesmen of ancient Thebes by many, including the Roman historian Diodorus Siculus. Diodorus does {{not have anything to}} say about the sexual orientation of Epaminondas or the Sacred Band, nor does he say anything about the following account, again from Plutarch (Amatorius 17). According to Plutarch's dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus, the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle. They were buried together, something usually reserved for <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> and wife in Greek society.|$|E
5|$|Following Ruland's {{departure}} in 1863, the Queen {{looked for}} <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> for Helena. However, as a middle child, {{the prospect of}} a powerful alliance with a European royal house was low. Her appearance was also a concern, as by the age of fifteen she was described by her biographer as chunky, dowdy and double-chinned. Furthermore, Victoria insisted that Helena's future husband had to be prepared to live near the Queen, thus keeping her daughter nearby. Her choice eventually fell on Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein; however, the match was politically awkward, and caused a severe breach within the royal family.|$|E

5|$|From {{the start}} of Elizabeth's reign, it was {{expected}} that she would marry and the question arose to whom. Although she received many offers for her hand, she never married and was childless; the reasons for this are not clear. Historians have speculated that Thomas Seymour had put her off sexual relationships, or that she knew herself to be infertile. She considered several suitors until she was about fifty. Her last courtship was with Francis, Duke of Anjou, 22 years her junior. While risking possible loss of power like her sister, who played into the hands of King Philip II of Spain, marriage offered the chance of an heir. However, the choice of <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> might also provoke political instability or even insurrection.|$|E
5|$|Her first {{position}} as a professor was at Rutgers School of LawâNewark in 1963. The appointment was not without its drawbacks; Ginsburg was informed she would be paid less than her male colleagues because she had <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> with a well-paid job. At the time Ginsburg entered academia, {{she was one of}} fewer than twenty female law professors in the United States. She was a professor of law, mainly civil procedure, at Rutgers from 1963 to 1972, receiving tenure from the school in 1969.|$|E
