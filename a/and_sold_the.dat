5|$|Washington {{left the}} house in April 1776. Nathaniel Tracy, who had made a great fortune {{as one of the}} {{earliest}} and most successful privateers under Washington, owned the house from 1781 to 1786. He then went bankrupt <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>the</b> house to Thomas Russell, a wealthy Boston merchant, who in turn occupied it until 1791.|$|E
5|$|Alexander died in 1944, and {{the death}} duties proved {{crippling}} to Geoffrey. In 1949 he sold the castle and 3,480 hectares (8,600acres) of the lands to the Ashdale Property Company, retaining a tenancy of the castle for himself. The Crown Estate bought the estate from Ashdale <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>the</b> castle back to Geoffrey in 1954. His son Colonel Walter Luttrell lived away from Dunster, and {{following the death of}} his mother– the last Luttrell to live in the property– gave the castle and most of its contents to the National Trust in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{his army}} service in 1919, Marquis was restless and unsure of his future path. He first {{restarted}} the practice at Livingston <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>the</b> house at Clyde Park (retaining some land there as a legacy for his daughters). He then decided to move to Whitehall, where he spent more and more of his time writing, at first on his wartime experiences, and then short articles on diverse subjects collected into volumes. He also wrote short stories during this period. However, he could not find a publisher.|$|E

5|$|The Hoots {{decision}} would again affect Burger King {{as it moved}} into the state of Texas. When Burger King expanded into the San Antonio area, it was prevented from utilizing the name of its signature product, the Whopper, in its local advertising and stores due to a prior state registered service mark owned by a local chain known as Whopper Burger. The chain, owned by Frank and Barbara Bates, prevented the company from using the name in Bexar County for several years until Mrs. Bates, the CEO of Whopper Burger {{after the death of}} her husband in 1983, retired <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>the</b> chain with its related trademarks to then-corporate parent Pillsbury in the mid-1980s.|$|E

Kongō was stricken from the Navy List in 1909 <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>the</b> next year for scrap.

5|$|The main {{building}} was begun in 1772, {{as a free}} hospital for the poor, but funding ran out two years later, and it was completed as a private residence. In the early 19th century, it was bought {{by a group of}} Franciscan nuns, who moved from an unsatisfactory site in Winchester. The nuns carried out a number of additions and extensions to the building to make it more suitable for their needs. They moved out of Taunton in 1950 <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>the</b> convent to the Sisters of St. Joseph, who continued to run a school on the site for the next twenty-six years.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} based on an {{unpublished}} book by I. A. R. Wylie. RKO Pictures bought the book in outline form in April 1941, but encountered casting difficulties <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>the</b> rights to MGM in December 1941 for $50,000. A day or two after they had obtained the rights, MGM Vice-President Eddie Mannix realized the source material was political in nature and tried to abandon the project. However, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Mannix relented and the production went forward. Once the film went into production at MGM, the book was published by Random House in April 1942.|$|E

5|$|The {{southern}} {{portion of}} SR 125 from Otay Mesa Road to SR 54 near Chula Vista is a toll road called the South Bay Expressway. This portion {{was completed in}} 2007 {{after many years of}} planning and litigation related to concerns over the destruction of endangered species habitat. The toll road was operated by a public-private partnership known as South Bay Expressway LLC. However, the partnership declared bankruptcy in 2010 <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>the</b> road to the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) in 2011. Since then, following a decrease in the toll amount, traffic using the highway has increased.|$|E

5|$|After the Thuns {{learned the}} game, they began {{teaching}} its rules to their fraternity brothers at Williams College around 1926. Daniel W. Layman, in turn, learned {{the game from}} the Thun brothers (who later tried to sell copies of the game commercially, but were advised by an attorney that the game could not be patented, as they were not its inventors). Layman later returned to his hometown of Indianapolis, Indiana, and began playing the game with friends there, ultimately producing hand-made versions of the board based on streets of that city. Layman then commercially produced <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>the</b> game, starting in 1932, with a friend in Indianapolis, who owned a company called Electronic Laboratories. This game was sold under the name The Fascinating Game of Finance (later shortened to Finance). Layman soon sold his rights to the game, which was then licensed, produced and marketed by Knapp Electric. The published board featured four railroads (one per side), Chance and Community Chest cards and spaces, and properties grouped by symbol, rather than color. Also in 1932, one edition of The Landlord's Game was published by the Adgame Company with {{a new set of}} rules called Prosperity, also by Magie.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the English Civil War in 1641, Bodiam Castle was in the {{possession}} of Lord Thanet. He supported the Royalist cause, <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>the</b> castle to help pay fines levied against him by Parliament. The castle was subsequently dismantled, and was left as a picturesque ruin until its purchase by John Fuller in 1829. Under his auspices, the castle was partially restored before being sold to George Cubitt, 1st Baron Ashcombe, and later to Lord Curzon, both of whom undertook further restoration work. The castle is protected as a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Monument. It has been owned by The National Trust since 1925, donated by Lord Curzon on his death, and is open to the public.|$|E
5|$|In 1613 James I {{returned}} the castle to Thomas Howard, the Earl of Suffolk, but the castle was now derelict and {{he chose to}} live at Audley End House instead. Thomas's son, Theophilus Howard, fell heavily into debt <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>the</b> castle, the estate and the former Great Park to Sir Robert Hitcham in 1635 for £14,000; as with several other established parks, such as Eye, Kelsale and Hundon, the Great Park was broken up turned into separate estates. Hitcham died the following year, leaving the castle and the manor to Pembroke College in Cambridge, {{with the proviso that}} the college destroy the internal castle buildings and construct a poorhouse on the site instead, operating {{under the terms of the}} recently passed Poor Law.|$|E

5|$|In 1876, Waller ran as a Republican {{candidate}} for US Congress. He lost the election by 8376 votes to Democratic lawyer Francis Dolan Collins. He did, however, win Columbia County in the election. He {{was also the}} proprietor of a furnace on Roaring Creek and built the Bloomsburg Sanitarium {{at the corner of}} Sixth Street and Market Street in Bloomsburg in 1870. Waller was vice president of the State Agricultural Society. He also extended Market Street in Bloomsburg and built many houses along it. Along with John Ramsay, he built First Street in Bloomsburg <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>the</b> lots on it to Welsh immigrants some time before 1847. He also laid out other residential streets in Bloomsburg. He supported moving the county seat of Columbia County from Danville to Bloomsburg, although he was unable to convince Danville's businessmen to move their industries to Bloomsburg. In 1866, he was made one of three trustees of Bloomsburg's Board of Trade.|$|E
5|$|In August 1906, a {{group of}} Cleveland Baptists {{incorporated}} an organization, the Baptist Home of Northern Ohio, to establish a retirement home for elderly Baptists. Ten months later, Southworth sold his house to the organization, which was supported financially by industrialist and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, who was a Baptist. With the aid of local churches, the home was opened on October 16, 1907. According to the 1910 census, the Baptist Home served fourteen residents {{at the end of}} 1910, at which time the entire property was worth $15,000. The former Southworth residence was not long a retirement home: the Baptist Home moved to a new location in 1919 <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>the</b> Southworth House in the same year. Since that time, the house has been used {{for a wide range of}} purposes.|$|E
5|$|In January 1851, Allen {{purchased}} the Eagle flour mills, an historically important industrial {{building in the}} area, which eventually gave the hamlet of Eagle Mills its name. The factory {{had a long history}} of failed business attempts. It was built in 1821 by Daniel Sheldon to mill flour using wheat supplied from Troy. After brief success, the business closed and the building sat idle. It was sold to James Bumstead who reopened the building as a feed mill. He too had troubles <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>the</b> building to James McChesney, who kept the building idle for some time before transferring the property to Catlin and Saxton, who began the manufacture of augers and bits. Also unsuccessful, Catlin and Saxton abandoned the business and James McChesney (whose name was still on the deed) sold the property to Groome and Shattuck, who began manufacturing monkey wrenches. This too failed and the property was sold to Paul Smith, a miller from nearby Cropseyville, who sold the property to Allen in 1851 because Smith later decided that he preferred to keep his mills consolidated in Cropseyville.|$|E
