50|$|A Mohr pipette, {{also known}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>graduated</b> pipette, is <b>a</b> type of pipette {{used to measure}} the volume of the liquid dispensed, {{although}} not <b>as</b> accurately <b>as</b> <b>a</b> volumetric pipette.

5|$|He {{enrolled}} {{in graduate school}} in electrical engineering at University of California, Berkeley, graduating with a Master of Science degree in 1953, and a Ph.D. in 1955. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> student at Berkeley he assisted {{in the construction of}} the California Digital Computer project CALDIC. His graduate work led to eight patents. After completing his PhD, Engelbart stayed on at Berkeley as an assistant professor to teach for a year, and left when it was clear he could not pursue his vision there.

5|$|In 1932, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> {{student at}} Chicago, he {{discovered}} physics there {{and had the}} rare opportunity to use the equipment of legendary physicist Albert A. Michelson. Alvarez also constructed an apparatus of Geiger counter tubes arranged as a cosmic ray telescope, and {{under the aegis of}} his faculty advisor Arthur Compton, conducted an experiment in Mexico City to measure the so-called East–West effect of cosmic rays. Observing more incoming radiation from the west, Alvarez concluded that primary cosmic rays were positively charged. Compton submitted the resulting paper to the Physical Review, with Alvarez's name at the top.|$|E
5|$|In May 1904, he {{received}} a first class BA in mathematics. Aside from a few months spent on holidays with family and friends, Keynes continued to involve himself with the university {{over the next two}} years. He took part in debates, further studied philosophy and attended economics lectures informally <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> student for one term, which constituted his only formal education in the subject. He also studied for Tripos in 1905 and, the following year took civil service exams.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the early}} work {{leading up to the}} {{discovery}} of the ubiquitin proteasome system occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s at the Technion in the laboratory of Avram Hershko, where Aaron Ciechanover worked <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> student. Hershko's year-long sabbatical in the laboratory of Irwin Rose at the Fox Chase Cancer Center provided key conceptual insights, though Rose later downplayed his role in the discovery. The three shared the 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work in discovering this system.|$|E

5|$|Rubin was {{inspired}} to pursue an undergraduate education at the currently all-women's school, Vassar College, because Maria Mitchell had been a professor there. She also ignored advice she had received from a high school science teacher to avoid a scientific career and become an artist. She earned her bachelor's degree in astronomy in 1948, the only graduate in astronomy that year. She attempted to enroll in a graduate program at Princeton, but was barred due to her gender. Princeton would not accept women as astronomy graduate students for 27 more years. Rubin also turned down an offer from Harvard University due to her husband, Robert Rubin's, position <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> student at Cornell University.|$|E
