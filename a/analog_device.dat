25|$|At Oxford University, Edmund Gunter {{built the}} first <b>analog</b> <b>device</b> to aid computation. The 'Gunter's scale' was a large plane scale, {{engraved}} with various scales, or lines. Natural lines, such as the line of chords, the line of sines and tangents are placed {{on one side of}} the scale and the corresponding artificial or logarithmic ones were on the other side. This calculating aid was a predecessor of the slide rule. It was William Oughtred (1575–1660) who first used two such scales sliding by one another to perform direct multiplication and division, and thus is credited as the inventor of the slide rule in 1622.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1961, Texas Instruments {{built for}} the Air Force a {{demonstration}} [...] "molecular computer" [...] with a 300-bit memory based on the #587 ICs of Kilby. Harvey Kreygon packed this computer into a volume of a little over 100cm3. In December 1961, the Air Force accepted the first <b>analog</b> <b>device</b> created within the molecular electronics program – a radio receiver. It uses costly ICs, which had less than 10–12 components and {{a high percentage of}} failed devices. This generated an opinion that ICs can only justify themselves for aerospace applications. However, the aerospace industry rejected those ICs for the low radiation hardness of their mesa transistors.|$|E
2500|$|Early games used {{interactive}} {{electronic devices}} with various display formats. The earliest example is from 1947—a [...] "Cathode ray tube Amusement Device" [...] was filed {{for a patent}} on 25 January 1947, by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann, and issued on 14 December 1948, as U.S. Patent 2455992. Inspired by radar display technology, it consisted of an <b>analog</b> <b>device</b> that allowed a user to control a vector-drawn dot on the screen to simulate a missile being fired at targets, which were drawings fixed to the screen. Other early examples include: The Nimrod computer at the 1951 Festival of Britain; OXO a tic-tac-toe Computer game by Alexander S. Douglas for the EDSAC in 1952; Tennis for Two, an electronic interactive game engineered by William Higinbotham in 1958; Spacewar!, written by MIT students Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen's on a DEC PDP-1 computer in 1961; and the hit ping pong-style Pong, a 1972 game by Atari. Each game used different means of display: NIMROD used a panel of lights {{to play the game}} of Nim, OXO used a graphical display to play tic-tac-toe Tennis for Two used an oscilloscope to display a side view of a tennis court, and Spacewar! used the DEC PDP-1's vector display to have two spaceships battle each other.|$|E
