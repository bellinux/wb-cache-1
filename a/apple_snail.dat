500|$|Sloughs are {{channels}} of free-flowing water {{in between the}} sawgrass marshes. Sloughs are deeper than sawgrass marshes, about , and may stay flooded for at least 11months {{out of the year}} if not multiple years in a row. The peat beds that support sawgrass are slightly elevated and may begin abruptly creating ridges of grass. The borders between these systems are called [...] "ridge-and-slough" [...] landscapes. Aquatic animals such as turtles, young alligators, snakes, and fish live in sloughs and they usually feed on aquatic invertebrates, such as the Florida <b>apple</b> <b>snail.</b> Plants grow here, usually submerged or floating like bladderwort (Utricularia), waterlily (Nymphaeaceae), or spatterdock (Nuphar lutea). Major sloughs in the Everglades system include the Shark River Slough draining to Florida Bay, Lostmans Slough bordering The Big Cypress, and Taylor Slough in the eastern Everglades.|$|E
500|$|Freshwater sloughs {{are perhaps}} the most common {{ecosystem}} associated with Everglades National Park. These drainage channels are characterized by low-lying areas covered in fresh water, flowing at an almost imperceptible [...] per day. Shark River Slough and Taylor Slough are significant features of the park. Sawgrass growing to a height of [...] or more, and broad-leafed marsh plants, are so prominent in this region that they gave the Everglades its nickname , cemented in the public imagination in the title for Marjory Stoneman Douglas's book (1947), which culminated years of her advocacy for considering the Everglades ecosystem as more than a [...] "swamp". Excellent feeding locations for birds, sloughs in the Everglades attract a great variety of waders such as herons, egrets, roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), ibises and brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), as well as limpkins (Aramus guarauna) and snail kites that eat <b>apple</b> <b>snail,</b> which in turn feed on the sawgrass. The sloughs' availability of fish, amphibians, and young birds attract a variety of freshwater turtles, alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), water moccasin (Agkistrodon piscivorus conanti), and eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus).|$|E

50|$|Pila is a genus {{of large}} {{freshwater}} snails with an operculum, African and Asian <b>apple</b> <b>snails,</b> aquatic gastropod mollusks {{in the family}} Ampullariidae, the <b>apple</b> <b>snails.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Apple</b> <b>snails</b> use the siphon in a {{way that}} is {{reminiscent}} of a human swimmer using a snorkel, except that the <b>apple</b> <b>snail's</b> siphon can be retracted completely, or extended to various lengths as needed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Apple</b> <b>snails</b> inhabit various ecosystems: ponds, {{swamps and}} rivers. Although they {{occasionally}} leave the water, they {{spend most of}} their time under water. Unlike the pulmonate <b>snail</b> families, <b>apple</b> <b>snails</b> are not hermaphroditic, but gonochoristic; i.e. they have separate genders.|$|R
2500|$|When a limpkin {{finds an}} <b>apple</b> <b>snail,</b> it carries it to land or very shallow water {{and places it}} in mud, the opening facing up. It deftly removes the {{operculum}} or [...] "lid" [...] and extracts the snail, seldom breaking the shell. The extraction takes 10 to 20 seconds. The orange-yellow yolk gland of female snails is usually shaken loose and not eaten. It often leaves piles of empty shells at favored spots.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{examples}} of species introduced {{for the purposes}} of benefiting agriculture, aquaculture or other economic activities are widespread. [...] Eurasian carp was first introduced to the United States as a potential food source. The <b>apple</b> <b>snail</b> was released in Southeast Asia with the intent that it be used as a protein source, and subsequently to places like Hawaii to establish a food industry. [...] In Alaska, foxes were introduced to many islands to create new populations for the fur trade. About twenty species of African and European dung beetles have established themselves in Australia after deliberate introduction by the Australian Dung Beetle Project in an effort to reduce the impact of livestock manure. The timber industry promoted the introduction of Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) from California to Australia and New Zealand as a commercial timber crop. [...] These examples represent only a small subsample of species that have been moved by humans for economic interests.|$|E
2500|$|The Hawaii Agricultural Statistics Service {{determined}} the 10-year median production of kalo in Hawaii {{to be about}} 6.1 million pounds (2,800 t). However, 2003 taro production in Hawaii was only 5 million pounds (2,300 t), an all-time low since record-keeping started in 1946. The previous low of 1997 was 5.5 million pounds (2,500 t). Despite generally growing demand, production was even lower in 2005—only 4 million pounds, with kalo for processing into poi accounting for 97.5%. [...] Urbanization is one cause driving down harvests from the high of 14.1 million pounds (6,400 t) in 1948, but more recently, the decline has resulted from pests and diseases. A nonnative <b>apple</b> <b>snail</b> (Pomacea canaliculata) is a major culprit along with a plant rot disease traced to a newly identified species of Fungus in the genus Phytophthora that now affects kalo crops throughout Hawaii. Although pesticides could control both problems to some extent, pesticide use in the loʻi is banned because of the opportunity for chemicals to migrate quickly into streams, and then eventually the sea.|$|E
50|$|The optimal {{aquarium}} {{water temperature}} for <b>apple</b> <b>snails</b> is between 18 to 28 C. <b>Apple</b> <b>snails</b> are {{more active and}} lively in the higher part of this temperature range. In these higher temperatures, the snails tend to eat, crawl and grow faster. At {{the lower end of}} the temperature range, , the snails may become inactive.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} <b>apple</b> <b>snail</b> in {{aquarium}} shops is Pomacea bridgesii, also called Pomacea diffusa, (the spike-topped <b>apple</b> <b>snail).</b> This species comes in different colours from brown to albino or yellow and even blue, purple, pink, and jade, {{with or without}} banding. Another common <b>apple</b> <b>snail</b> is Pomacea canaliculata; this snail is bigger, rounder and {{is more likely to}} eat aquatic plants, which makes it less suitable for most aquaria. This species can also have different shell and body colours. The [...] "giant ramshorn snail" [...] (Marisa cornuarietis) although not always recognized as an <b>apple</b> <b>snail</b> due to its discoidal shape, is also a popular aquatic pet. Occasionally, the Florida <b>apple</b> <b>snail</b> (Pomacea paludosa) is found in the aquarium trade and these are often collected in the wild from ditches and ponds in Florida. The giant Pomacea maculata is rarely used as an aquarium species.|$|E
5000|$|In Veracruz, Mexico, {{there is}} a {{subspecies}} of <b>apple</b> <b>snail</b> known as Pomacea patula catemacensis Baker, 1922. This subspecies is endemic to Lake Catemaco. This large snail is locally known as [...] "tegogolo" [...] and is prized as a nutritious food item, with approximately 12 grams of protein per 100 grams of <b>apple</b> <b>snail</b> flesh according to the <b>apple</b> <b>snail</b> nutritional information. They are also low in fat and high in minerals. Only wild or specifically cultured apple snails are fit for human consumption; those found in domestic aquaria may be unsuitable.|$|E
