50|$|In the United States, taxpayers may file an <b>amended</b> <b>return</b> {{with the}} Internal Revenue Service to correct errors {{reported}} on a previous income tax return. Typically a taxpayer {{does not need to}} file an <b>amended</b> <b>return</b> if he or she has math errors as the IRS will make the necessary corrections. For individuals, amended returns are filed using Form 1040X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. In some cases taxpayers may use Form 1045, for example, to carry back a Net Operating Loss to a prior tax period. Form 1045 is generally processed much faster than Form 1040X.|$|E

This was done just before Justice Department investigators started seeking the Clintons' Whitewater files. The payment was made without filing an <b>amended</b> <b>return</b> (possibly because the three-year period for <b>amended</b> <b>return</b> filing had passed), but did include full interest on the amount of the error, including the additional two-year delay. The Whitewater files in question, publicly released in August 1995, cast some doubt on the Clintons' assertions in the matter, as they showed that the couple was aware that the interest payments in question were paid by the Whitewater corporation, and not them personally.|$|E

He was acquitted on one felony count of conspiracy to defraud the government and one felony count of filing a false claim with the government. The allegations against Snipes had included charges that he filed a false <b>amended</b> <b>return</b> including a false tax refund claim of over US$4 million for the year 1996 and a false <b>amended</b> <b>return</b> including a false tax refund claim of over US$7.3 million for the year 1997, using the [...] "861 argument." [...] The indictment said Snipes used accountants who already {{had a history of}} filing false returns to obtain refund payments for their clients.

50|$|Following the ruling, Maryland offered refunds to Maryland {{residents}} who had paid the local income tax without a credit for income taxes paid to other states. Local governments in Maryland had {{prepared for the}} prospect of having to issue refunds before the Supreme Court issued its decision. The local governments were estimated to be on the hook to issue $200 million in refunds to 55,000 taxpayers, with $115 million (including interest) owed by Montgomery County alone. The state government planned to pay the refunds, then recover the refunded money from local governments by reducing future tax revenue distributions. Due to the statute of limitations, the refund was available to all taxpayers affected by the Wynne decision for 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014; refunds for tax years as early as 2006 were available for some taxpayers who had filed a timely <b>amended</b> <b>return.</b>|$|E
50|$|The plaintiffs were {{a husband}} and wife who {{purchased}} a used piano at an auction sale in 1957 for approximately $15.00. In 1964, while cleaning the piano, they discovered $4,467.00 in old currency in the piano. Plaintiffs exchanged the old currency for new at a bank and reported $4,467.00 on their 1964 joint U.S. federal income tax return as ordinary income from other sources. On October 18, 1965, the couple filed an <b>amended</b> <b>return,</b> eliminating $4,467.00 from the gross income computation and requesting a refund of $836.51. On January 18, 1966, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rejected their refund claim, and they later filed a lawsuit. The taxpayers asserted three arguments: (1) $4,467.00 is not includable in gross income under Internal Revenue Code section 61 (26 U.S.C. Sec. 61); (2) Even if the money was gross income, it was due and owing in the year the piano was purchased, 1957, and by 1964 the statute of limitations provided by 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6501 had elapsed; and (3) If the money is gross income in 1964, then plaintiffs are entitled to capital gains treatment under Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.|$|E

CoBank asserted that the Supremacy Clause accords federal instrumentalities immunity from state taxation unless Congress has expressly waived this immunity, which the Act did not expressly do. The state of Missouri denied the request, but the Missouri State Supreme Court reversed, stating that because the Act's current version is silent as to the banks' tax immunity, Congress cannot {{be said to have}} expressly consented to state income taxation and, thus, the banks are exempt.|$|R
50|$|On November 22, 2005, in Philadelphia, PA, Larken Rose {{was sentenced}} to 15 months in prison, {{followed}} by one year supervised release and fined $10,000.

On those <b>amended</b> <b>returns,</b> he reported no tax due and requested a refund for all income taxes paid in those years. At trial, Rose claimed that he failed to file returns and sought refund claims based on his determination that his income received inside the United States was not taxable under Internal Revenue Code Section 861 and regulations.

40|$|When a {{taxpayer}} files an honest 2 ̆ 7 {{federal income tax}} return for a taxable year, section 6501 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code 2 limits {{the period of time}} during which the Government can assess a tax for that year to a three-year period commencing with the date that the return was filed. The three-year limitations period is extended for an additional three years by section 6501 (e) (1) (A) if the taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s return omits properly includible gross income in an amount in excess of twenty-five percent of the gross income that was reported. If {{a taxpayer}} fails to file a return for a taxable year or files a fraudulent return, sections 6501 (c) (1) and (c) (3) permit the tax for that year to be assessed at any time; in other words, there is no limitation on the time available to the Government to assess or collect the tax. If a taxpayer who failed to file a timely return for a taxable year subsequently fies an honest delinquent return, the three-year limitations period commences to run from the date that the delinquent return is fied no matter how tardy it is and irrespective of whether the taxpayer had a fraudulent purpose for failing to file on time. 3 On the other hand, the Supreme Court recently held that a taxpayer who initially files a fraudulent income tax return cannot invoke a period of limitations by filing an honest <b>amended</b> <b>return</b> correcting the fraudulent aspects of the original return. The Supreme Court held in Badaracco v. Commissioner 4 that once a fraudulent return has been filed, there is no limitation on the time available to the Government to assess a tax deficiency and penalties for that year regardless of corrective action taken by the taxpayer or by anyone else. Prior to the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Badaracco, the Tax Court and two circuit courts of appeals had applied a limitations period once an honest <b>amended</b> <b>return</b> was filed, 5 but two other circuit courts of appeals had held that no period of limitations is applicable in such cases. 6 As will be shown below, the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s eight-to-one decision in Badaracco was not merely poorly reasoned and erroneous; it was an egregious misapplication of the principles of statutory construction. The issue resolved by the Court is not one of great moment, and the Court 2 ̆ 7 s mishandling of that issue is not in itself of much consequence. What is interesting is- how eight justices of the Court could err in such a seemingly easy case and what that error suggests as to the importance of continuing to provide for Supreme Court review of tax litigation. The case also serves as a useful exemplar of the 2 ̆ 2 do 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 don 2 ̆ 7 ts 2 ̆ 2 of statutory construction. Before addressing the lessons to be derived from Badaracco, it is necessary to make good on the author 2 ̆ 7 s claim that it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of a reasonably skeptical reader that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision was patently wrong and resulted from a poor technique of statutory construction. This is a heavy burden, especially since the decision was reached by an overwhelming majority of the Court and since two courts of appeals and at least one student law review note reached the same result. 7 The reader must judge whether the author succeeds in satisfying it. This Article will first set forth the Court 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning and then will consider how the issue should have been resolved...|$|E
