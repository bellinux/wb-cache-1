5|$|Inland {{from the}} bay, {{the towns of}} Harrisburg and Houston were both founded on the Buffalo Bayou by {{entrepreneurs}} from New York and competed <b>as</b> <b>commercial</b> centers, but neither was as significant as Galveston. Texas State Historical Association.Davenport (1843), p. 170. Throughout the 19th century these three cities developed increasing influence on the Bay Area communities, particularly as railroads were built through the region.|$|E
5|$|The O-Bahn {{has caused}} a {{clustering}} of commercial and community development near the Tea Tree Plaza Interchange, as service-providing organisations and businesses have sought to exploit the area's easy accessibility to public transport and the city centre. Market imperatives have also been aided by the zoning of the land around the area <b>as</b> <b>commercial</b> rather than residential. The area around Tea Tree Plaza {{is one of five}} designated regional centres within the Adelaide metropolis.|$|E
5|$|Vinegar is {{typically}} 4–18% acetic acid by mass. Vinegar is used directly as a condiment, {{and in the}} pickling of vegetables and other foods. Table vinegar {{tends to be more}} diluted (4% to 8% acetic acid), while commercial food pickling employs solutions that are more concentrated. The proportion of acetic acid used worldwide as vinegar is not as large <b>as</b> <b>commercial</b> uses, but is by far the oldest and best-known application.|$|E

5|$|A {{small number}} of pillboxes had been {{constructed}} in the First World War and where possible these were integrated into the defence plans. Some pillboxes may pre-date {{the publication of the}} FW3 designs, but in any case some local commanders introduced modifications to the standard FW3 designs or introduced designs of their own. These non-standard design pillboxes may be produced in some numbers or completely ad hoc designs suited to local conditions. Other designs were produced <b>as</b> <b>commercial</b> ventures.|$|E
5|$|Further {{disagreements}} existed {{about the}} design and character of the new building. Facsimile reconstruction, while feasible, was not seriously contemplated. There was a general agreement that the new building should also have a cultural as well <b>as</b> <b>commercial</b> purpose. While the Jewish Community of Zagreb envisioned a modern design reminiscent of the original synagogue, the Bet Israel advocated building {{a replica of the}} original synagogue's facade, perceiving it as having a powerful symbolism. Opinions of architects, urban planners, and art historians were also divided along similar lines.|$|E

5|$|In 1948 Britain's railways, {{and hence}} the canal, were nationalised, and became the {{responsibility}} of the British Transport Commission. In 1963 control of the canal passed to British Waterways. Under the terms of the Transport Act 1968, all waterways within the jurisdiction of British Waterways were classified <b>as</b> <b>commercial,</b> cruising or remainder waterways. Remainder waterways were those that were deemed to have no economic future, and maintenance would only be carried out where failure to do so would create health or safety issues. The Grantham Canal was listed in this latter category.|$|E
5|$|In Iran, as of May 2014, {{according}} to its Yoga Association, there were approximately 200 yoga centres in the country, a quarter {{of them in the}} capital Tehran, where groups can often be seen practising in parks. This has been met by opposition among conservatives. In May 2009, Turkey's head of the Directorate of Religious Affairs, Ali Bardakoğlu, discounted personal development techniques such as reiki and yoga <b>as</b> <b>commercial</b> ventures that could lead to extremism. His comments were made in the context of reiki and yoga possibly being a form of proselytization at the expense of Islam.|$|E
5|$|International {{airports}} sometimes serve {{military as}} well <b>as</b> <b>commercial</b> purposes and their viability is also affected by technological developments. Canton Island Airport, for example, in the Phoenix Islands (Kiribati), {{after serving as}} a military airport during World War II, {{was used as a}} refuelling stop by commercial aircraft such as Qantas which stationed ground crew there in the late 1950s. The advent in the early 1960s of jet aircraft such as the Boeing 707 with the range to fly non-stop between Australia or New Zealand and Hawaii, meant that a mid-Pacific stop was no longer needed and the airport was closed to regular commercial use. Other international airports, such as Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, have been decommissioned and replaced when they reached capacity or technological advances rendered them inadequate.|$|E

5|$|Originally part of {{the pirate}} kingdom of Jean Lafitte, this area {{played a role in}} the early history of Texas having been the site of some early rebellions against Mexican rule and the site of the victory of the Texas army over the Mexican army during the Texas Revolution.

As the nearby cities of Galveston and Houston developed <b>as</b> <b>commercial</b> centers, the Bay Area communities became part of a principal commercial corridor between the cities.|$|E

5|$|Since the 17th century, peat {{has been}} cut for fuel for {{domestic}} heating and cooking and it is called turf when so used. The process accelerated <b>as</b> <b>commercial</b> exploitation of bogs grew. In the 1940s, machines for cutting turf were introduced and larger-scale exploitation became possible. In the Republic, this became the responsibility of a semi-state company called Bord na Móna. In addition to domestic uses, commercially extracted turf is used {{in a number of}} industries, especially electricity generation though peat is being combined with biomass for dual-firing electricity generation.|$|E

5|$|The station {{opened in}} the 1870s and was known as New York Junction and Germantown Junction. A new station, which ushered in the Beaux-Arts style for large train stations, was built from 1896 to 1901. After a 1912–1915 enlargement, it was renamed as North Philadelphia. Despite several other renovations, its use {{declined}} in the mid and late 20th century; in 1991, Amtrak constructed a smaller replacement station across the tracks.

5|$|Weather ship {{observations}} {{proved to}} be helpful in wind and wave studies, <b>as</b> <b>commercial</b> shipping tended to avoid weather systems for safety reasons, whereas the weather ships did not. They were also helpful in monitoring storms at sea, such as tropical cyclones. Beginning in the 1970s, their role was largely superseded by weather buoys because of the ships' significant cost. The removal of a weather ship became a negative factor in forecasts {{leading up to the}} Great Storm of 1987. The last weather ship was Polarfront, known as weather station M ("Mike"), which was removed from operation on January 1, 2010. Weather observations from ships continue from a fleet of voluntary merchant vessels in routine commercial operation.|$|E
5|$|While Union Station {{was busy}} from its opening and through World War II, {{passenger}} rail service began to dwindle {{after the war}} when air and highway travel became more popular. By the 1960s, the New York Central drastically cut service, while the Pennsylvania abandoned service to Erie altogether. Both railroads were merged in 1968 to form Penn Central, and passenger rail was transferred from Penn Central to Amtrak in 1971. At one point, from 1972 to 1975, even Amtrak service in Erie was suspended. With reduced demand for train travel, Union Station was neglected and allowed to decay until Logistics Plus bought it in 2003. Since then it has been restored, with portions re-purposed <b>as</b> <b>commercial</b> and retail space.|$|E
