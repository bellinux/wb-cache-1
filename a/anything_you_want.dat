500|$|Giving {{the film}} only the tagline [...] "A love {{story in the}} city of dreams", David Lynch has refused to comment on Mulholland Drives meaning or symbolism, leading to much {{discussion}} and multiple interpretations. The Christian Science Monitor film critic David Sterritt spoke with Lynch after the film screened at Cannes and wrote that the director [...] "insisted that Mulholland Drive does tell a coherent, comprehensible story", unlike some of Lynch's earlier films like Lost Highway. On the other hand, Justin Theroux said of Lynch's feelings on the multiple meanings people perceive in the film, [...] "I think he's genuinely happy for it to mean <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> He loves it when people come up with really bizarre interpretations. David works from his subconscious." ...|$|E
500|$|The whole {{song was}} written without that main sample; {{it was a}} last-minute thing. The song had kind {{of a lot of}} R music in it. And Kanye gave marching orders of [...] "Take out <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> but don't add. Just take away." [...] Like, [...] "OK." [...] And before that, we listened to the sample {{together}} and thought, [...] "Hmm, maybe there's a way to integrate this into the song." [...] So we started by getting the sample to work in the song, and then taking out as much stuff as we could, and then in the chorus reducing what was this whole musical thing, just this sort of one ugly, distorted bass note. I was thinking like Alan Vega and Suicide, that kind of noise-synth minimal vibe. So that was the idea behind the chorus: Take it from this sort of R thing and turn it into this kind of post-punk, edge thing. And the lyrics he wrote were so good and funny. It just turned into a really good record. The sample is so good.|$|E
500|$|In August {{the band}} began another {{tour of the}} US, {{followed}} by a trip to Australia and New Zealand. Brian Downey did not accompany them, having contracted pneumonia and preferring {{to spend some time}} in Ireland. He was replaced for the tour by American drummer Mark Nauseef. On their return, Downey rejoined the band and at the beginning of 1979 they recorded [...] in Paris. The sessions were marked by the increasing drug habits of Lynott and Gorham, and the general presence of drugs around the band. This also showed in the subject matter on the album, in songs such as [...] "Got to Give It Up". Celtic influences remained, however, particularly in the album closer [...] "Róisín Dubh", a seven-minute medley of traditional Irish songs given a twin guitar rock veneer. Two singles, [...] "Waiting for an Alibi" [...] and [...] "Do <b>Anything</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> To", were successful, and the album reached no. 2 in the UK. A third, moderately successful single, [...] "Sarah" [...] was Lynott's ode to his new-born daughter.|$|E

500|$|In early 1986, an {{execution}} date (March 4) {{was set on}} the Chi Omega convictions; the Supreme Court issued a brief stay, but the execution was quickly rescheduled. In April, shortly after the new date (July 2) was announced, Bundy finally confessed to Hagmaier and Nelson what they believed was {{the full range of}} his depredations, including details of what he did to some of his victims after their deaths. He told them that he revisited Taylor Mountain, Issaquah, and other secondary crime scenes, often several times, to lie with his victims and perform sexual acts with their decomposing bodies until putrefaction forced him to stop. In some cases, he drove for several hours each way and remained the entire night. In Utah, he applied makeup to Melissa Smith's lifeless face, and he repeatedly washed Laura Aime's hair. [...] "If you've got time," [...] he told Hagmaier, [...] "they can be <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> them to be." [...] He decapitated approximately twelve of his victims with a hacksaw, and kept at least one group of severed heads—probably the four later found on Taylor Mountain (Rancourt, Parks, Ball and Healy)—in his apartment {{for a period of time}} before disposing of them.|$|E
500|$|Producer Bob Ezrin {{had worked}} with Alice Cooper, Lou Reed, and Kiss, as well as {{producing}} Peter Gabriel's debut solo album. At the suggestion of Waters's then-girlfriend Lady Carolyne Christie, who had worked as Ezrin's secretary, the band hired him to co-produce the album. From the start, Waters {{made it very clear}} who was in charge: [...] "You can write <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> Just don't expect any credit". [...] Ezrin, Waters, and Gilmour read Waters's concept, keeping what they liked, and discarding what they thought was not good enough. Waters and Ezrin worked mostly on the story, improving the concept. [...] A 40-page script was presented {{to the rest of the}} band, with positive results: [...] "The next day at the studio, we had a table read, like you would with a play, but with the whole of the band, and their eyes all twinkled, because then they could see the album." [...] Ezrin broadened the storyline, distancing it from the autobiographical work Waters had written, and instead basing it on a composite, or gestalt character named Pink. Engineer Nick Griffiths later said of the Canadian producer, [...] "Ezrin was very good in The Wall, because he did manage to pull the whole thing together. He's a very forceful guy. There was a lot of argument about how it should sound between Roger and Dave, and he bridged the gap between them." [...] Waters wrote most of the album's material, with Gilmour co-writing [...] "Comfortably Numb", [...] "Run Like Hell", and [...] "Young Lust", and Ezrin co-writing [...] "The Trial".|$|E
500|$|Starting with Madonna's voice multi-tracked {{questioning}} – [...] "Am I gonna be a star?", [...] "Should I {{change my}} name?" [...] – the lyrics develop into what Rikky Rooksby of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna {{states is a}} complaint about modern-day life. She also questions the shallowness of modern life and the [...] "American dream." [...] "I know it sounds clichéd," [...] she admitted. [...] "But I've had 20 years of fame and fortune, and I feel that I {{have the right to}} an opinion on what it is and isn't. All everyone is obsessed about now is being a celebrity. I'm saying that's bullshit, and who knows better than me? Before it happens, you have all kinds of notions about how wonderful celebrity is and how much joy it's going to bring you. Then you arrive... In America, more than any other place in the world, you have the freedom to be <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to be. Which is all well and good, but it only works if you have a value system – and we seem not to have one anymore. It's, 'Whatever it takes to get to the top, that's what you gotta do.' It's the allure of the beautiful life: 'Look like this, you're gonna be happy. Drive this car, you're gonna be popular. Wear these clothes and people are gonna want to fuck you.' It's a very powerful illusion and people are caught up in it, including myself. Or I was." ...|$|E

But it's strange to me to be in a beautiful place like this, drinking wine with gentlefolks--and I'm almost afraid--" ...|$|R
2500|$|Grossman {{sometimes}} appeared treacherously {{devoted to}} his clients' satisfaction. While wooing Joan Baez into representation, Grossman is quoted as saying, [...] "Look, what do you like?

2500|$|In March 2013, Trump {{said about}} the lawsuit: [...] "Essentially the judge just said 'Trump is too famous. He's so famous that you're allowed to say <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> about him.' Well, I {{disagree}} with that." [...] In July 2015, O'Brien, who was now working for Bloomberg View, wrote a column titled [...] "Dear Mr. Trump: I'm Worth $10 Billion, Too," [...] in which he exaggerated {{the value of his}} belongings {{in the same way as}} Trump.|$|E
2500|$|Rolf {{was born}} in 1969 {{and grew up in}} Cincinnati. His father, a lawyer, and mother, a unionized teacher with a blue-collar background, held liberal values and taught him to abide by the Golden Rule. His father had pledged to a mostly black {{fraternity}} in the early 1960s in support of the civil rights movement, and his mother took him to [...] "U.S. Out of Central America" [...] meetings at her Unitarian church. They also instilled the belief [...] "that everyone is equal and you can be <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to be", which Rolf now considers [...] "either the most naive or dishonest thing you can tell a child". He had a comfortable upbringing, once recalling, [...] "We had a brick ranch home and a sandbox in the backyard. We had a station wagon. For vacation, throw the kids in the back seat, stay in the Best Western on the way to Disneyland. It was a sitcom, stereotype life." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to The War for Late Night, [...] "the 'People of Earth' letter—the manifesto, as NBC {{came to call}} it—changed the tone. This wasn't just Conan saying no; it was Conan saying no, and you're wrong, and, by the way, go fuck yourselves." [...] However, {{the moment}} that [...] "represented {{the point of no}} return" [...] came that Wednesday night, as a [...] "clearly liberated" [...] O'Brien made this joke in his monologue: [...] "I'm trying very hard to stay {{positive}} here, and I want to tell you something. This is honest. Hosting The Tonight Show has been the fulfillment of a lifelong dream for me. And I just want to say to the kids out there watching: You can do <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> in life. Yeah, yeah—unless Jay Leno wants to do it, too." [...] Following the joke, Leno called Gaspin, asking, [...] "Why the fuck am I giving up a half hour for this guy?" [...] Conversations changed as to how much O'Brien would take to resolve the matter, and parties began to discuss a settlement.|$|E
2500|$|Dare {{was almost}} universally {{critically}} acclaimed in the UK, and featured {{strongly in the}} year end polls for 1981. In Melody Maker Steve Sutherland celebrated the fact the album would irritate the guitar-rock traditionalists, saying, [...] "All let's-pretend-pompous it's cornily consistent, cultured, crude, elegant, cheap... <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> it to be. Me? I think it's a masterpiece. Sure to upset some, sell to millions more and so it should the way it tramps all over rock traditions. A trite sound, a retarded glam image and a mock respect. All the appeal in the world... Dare should show up the pathetic farce of pop mythology once and for all." [...] Smash Hits critic David Hepworth called it [...] "chock-full of precise, memorable melodies delivered with style and humour". Noted music critic Paul Morley wrote in the NME, [...] "Dare is the second intoxicating intervention to be produced out of the great split , and already it's the first Human League greatest hits collection... Much more than ABBA or whoever you like, The Human League signify that deliciously serious, sincerely disposable MOR music can possess style, quality and sophistication... I think that Dare {{is one of the}} GREAT popular music LPs." ...|$|E
2500|$|FBI agents twice {{visited the}} Paine home in early November, when Oswald was not present, {{and spoke to}} Mrs. Paine. Oswald visited the Dallas FBI office about 2 to 3 weeks before the assassination, asking to see Special Agent James P. Hosty. When {{he was told that}} Hosty was unavailable, Oswald left a note that, {{according}} to the receptionist, read: [...] "Let this be a warning. I will blow up the FBI and the Dallas Police Department if you don't stop bothering my wife" [...] "Lee Harvey Oswald." [...] The note allegedly contained some sort of threat, but accounts vary as to whether Oswald threatened to [...] "blow up the FBI" [...] or merely [...] "report this to higher authorities". According to Hosty, the note said, [...] "If you have <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to learn about me, come talk to me directly. If you don't cease bothering my wife, I will take the appropriate action and report this to the proper authorities." [...] Agent Hosty said that he destroyed Oswald's note on orders from his superior, Gordon Shanklin, after Oswald was named the suspect in the Kennedy assassination.|$|E

2500|$|Skeptic Michael Shermer {{claims that}} the {{emergence}} of the [...] "Paul is dead" [...] phenomenon, including the alleged message at the end of [...] "I'm So Tired", was caused by faulty perception of a pattern. Shermer argues that the human brain evolved with a strong pattern recognition ability that was necessary to process the large amount of noise in man's environment, but that today this ability leads to false positives. Stanford University psychology professor Brian Wandell postulates that the observance of backward messages is a mistake arising from this pattern recognition facility, and argues that subliminal persuasion theories are [...] "bizarre" [...] and [...] "implausible." [...] Rumors of backmasking in popular music have been described as auditory pareidolia. James Walker, president of Christian research group Watchman Fellowship, states that [...] "You could take a Christian hymn, and if you played it backwards long enough at different speeds, you could make that hymn say <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to"; Led Zeppelin publicist BP Fallon concurs, saying [...] "Play anything backwards, and you'll find something."
