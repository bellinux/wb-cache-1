5|$|The {{script for}} the episode went through 30 drafts, and four {{separate}} stories before the BBC were satisfied {{and ordered the}} series. Writing the pilot was completed before the September 11 terrorist attacks; after the attacks took place, the producers decided to add mention of the events into the episode in order to acknowledge {{the fact that the}} series is <b>about</b> <b>fighting</b> terrorism.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Shackleton {{returned}} to New Zealand from the Ross Sea, having {{picked up the}} survivors of the winter party, Worsley travelled to England aboard the RMS Makura. As an RNR officer, he wanted to join in the fight against Imperial Germany. After arriving in Liverpool, {{he made his way to}} London and was quickly assigned to HMS Pembroke, the shore station at Chatham. Here, for three months, he learned <b>about</b> <b>fighting</b> U-boats, which were causing considerable damage to supply convoys crossing the Atlantic. Several tactics were deployed against the U-boats. One of these involved the use of Q-ships, small merchant vessels fitted out with hidden armament that could be deployed against any U-boats which surfaced and approached the seemingly unarmed ship. Another tactic was the use of P-boats, which were patrol boats that carried out convoy escort duties and anti-submarine work. The P-boats had a distinctive profile, and their effectiveness wore off as U-boat commanders began to recognise and avoid them. The later built P-boats were designed with a more conventional profile approximating that of a merchant ship, and thus were similar to Q-ships.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, Lee {{continued}} {{to act in}} plays and in films. In 1942, he played in two comedies by William Saroyan; Lee earned approving reviews despite the generally negative response to these plays. In 1943, he took a lead role in a production of the race-themed drama South Pacific, directed by Lee Strasberg, concerning a cynical African-American soldier who had racially based reservations <b>about</b> <b>fighting</b> the Japanese.|$|E
25|$|UFC {{president}} Dana White {{stated that}} Jake Shields would be St-Pierre's next opponent and {{confirmed that the}} two would meet in the main event of UFC 129 on April 30, 2011, in Toronto. White suggested that if St-Pierre defeated Shields, it could mark a move to middleweight and a superfight against then UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva. St-Pierre defeated Shields via unanimous decision. When asked <b>about</b> <b>fighting</b> Silva during the post-fight interview, St-Pierre stated {{that he had no}} desire to pursue it.|$|E
25|$|Imamura used Japanese {{folklore}} as {{an inspiration}} to add a bird and a hare as two other protagonists. He also added a toad; the inspiration came from a staff member of Nintendo EAD who used a toad as his personal mascot. Imamura populated the Cornerian army with dogs and the enemy army with monkeys, and made Pepper a dog and Andross a monkey, since there is a Japanese expression <b>about</b> <b>fighting</b> like dogs and monkeys. Miyamoto created several puppets and photographed them to use as artwork for {{the cover of the}} Star Fox game; Miyamoto was a fan of English puppet dramas, such as Thunderbirds, so he wanted the game cover to feature puppets.|$|E

25|$|Peter feels bad <b>about</b> <b>fighting</b> with Sydney {{but does}} not re-invite him to the wedding. Instead, he assembles an array of random groomsmen that {{includes}} Robbie, father Oswald (J. K. Simmons), and Ferrigno. Before the wedding, Zooey sees Peter looking forlorn, clearly missing his friend Sydney. She calls and invites Sydney, who is, unbeknownst to them, already {{en route to the}} wedding. Just before the vows are to be taken, Sydney makes a dramatic entrance via moped. He informs Peter and Zooey that he is, in fact, a successful investor and returns the money he borrowed from Peter, stating that the billboards were the couple's wedding present. Peter and Zooey declare their love to each other, Sydney assumes the role of best man, and the wedding commences.|$|E
25|$|When the {{national}} capital was moved inland to Chongqing, Zou continued his attacks on Chiang, then moved to the relative safety of Hong Kong, which {{he was forced to}} leave when the Japanese took the city in December 1941. Since he would not be welcomed in Chongqing, he first stayed in a village on the Guangdong-Guanxi border, then for a time with the New Fourth Army in northern Jiangsu. Although he suffered from a painful infection in his ear, he lectured widely and continued his activities in the communist held areas. By the end of 1942, however, while keeping an upbeat tone in his publications, Zou realized that the initial stages of optimistic unity had ended, that the Nationalist government was using terrorist repression, and that the common people were not necessarily well-informed or enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>fighting</b> Japan.|$|E
25|$|In 1972 Brel {{appeared}} in his eighth feature film, Le Bar de la fourche (The bar at the crossing), directed by Alain Levent and co-starring Rosy Varte and Isabelle Huppert. Brel plays Vincent Van Horst, a hard-drinking bon vivant who loves his freedom and his women. In 1916 he leaves Europe, which is torn apart by the war, and moves to Canada, intending {{to meet up with}} Maria, the only woman he ever loved. On the way to Canada, he meets a young boy who dreams <b>about</b> <b>fighting</b> in the European war. When Vincent arrives at the Bar de la Fourche, managed by Maria, he finds her looking older. He finds consolation in another woman, Annie, who looks down on him and drives Vincent and Olivier to fight a duel against each other. The film was released on 23 August 1972.|$|E

25|$|At Bazarov's home, {{they are}} {{received}} enthusiastically by his parents, {{and the traditional}} moeurs of both father and mother, who adulate their son, are portrayed with a nostalgic, idealistic description of humble people and their fast-disappearing world of simple values and virtues. Bazarov's social cynicism, invariably on display with outsiders, is still quite clear as he settles back into his own family's ambiance. Interrupting his father as he speaks to Arkady, he proves rather abrupt and still the powerful center of attention despite being around his parents. Arkady, who has delighted Bazarov's father by assuring him that his son has a brilliant future in store, in turn reproves his friend for his brusqueness. Later, Bazarov almost comes to blows with Arkady after the latter makes a joke <b>about</b> <b>fighting</b> over Bazarov's cynicism. This once again shows the distance and changes within Arkady and Bazarov's relationship, as Arkady becomes more defiant against Bazarov's ideals. After a brief stay, much to the parents' disappointment, they decide to return to Maryino, stopping {{on the way to}} see Madame Odintsova, who receives them coolly. They leave almost immediately and return to Arkady's home.|$|E
500|$|The pilot {{originally}} underwent 30 rewrites {{and four}} separate story ideas before the BBC {{was satisfied with}} it. Similarly, the second episode went through four rewrites. After four episodes were written, the September 11 attacks took place, resulting in three thousand deaths in the United States. As a result, the episodes were rewritten {{to take account of}} the events to assure the audience that the show is <b>about</b> <b>fighting</b> terrorism. According to Wolstencroft, the attacks [...] "sidewinded" [...] the show, [...] "perversely made it as relevant as can be," [...] and [...] "commuted a great sense of responsibility" [...] on Spooks.|$|E

500|$|In a June 2015 column {{written for}} the French sports {{newspaper}} L'Équipe Murray criticised {{what he described as}} a double standard applied by many in their attitudes towards Amélie Mauresmo in her role as Murray's coach, highlighting how many observers attributed his poor performances during the early part of her tenure to her appointment, which Murray denied, before pointing out that his previous coaches had not been blamed by the media for other spells of poor form. He also lamented the lack of female coaches working in elite tennis, and concluded: [...] "Have I become a feminist? Well, if being a feminist is <b>about</b> <b>fighting</b> so that a woman is treated like a man then yes, I suppose I have".|$|E
500|$|Regino of Prüm {{and other}} {{contemporary}} authors portray the 9th-century Hungarians as nomadic warriors. Emperor Leo the Wise underlines {{the importance of}} horses to their military tactics. Analysis of horse skulls found in Hungarian warriors graves has not revealed any significant difference between these horses and Western breeds. Regino of Prüm states that the Hungarians knew [...] "nothing <b>about</b> <b>fighting</b> hand-to-hand in formation or taking besieged cities", but he underlines their archery skills. Remains indicate that composite bows were the Hungarians' most important weapons. In addition, slightly curved sabres were unearthed in many warrior tombs from the period. Regino of Prüm noted the Hungarians' preference for deceptions such as apparent retreat in battle. Contemporaneous writers also recounted their viciousness, represented by the slaughter of adult males in settlement raids.|$|E
500|$|Lambert's girth {{was then}} enormous; six men of normal size could fit {{together}} inside his waistcoat, {{and each of}} his stockings {{was the size of}} a sack. [...] His £50 annuity did not adequately cover his living costs, and his size prevented him from working. He became a virtual recluse. [...] Stories of his bulk had by then begun to spread, and travellers visiting Leicester would use various pretexts to visit his home. One such visitor asked Lambert's servant to allow him entry as he wished to ask Lambert's advice <b>about</b> <b>fighting</b> cocks; Lambert leaned out of the window and told the servant to [...] "tell the gentleman that I am a shy cock". On another occasion, he admitted into his house a Nottingham man who sought his advice about a mare's pedigree; on realising the man was visiting only to look at him, Lambert told him that the horse in question was [...] "by Impertinence out of Curiosity".|$|E

500|$|The abuse {{he faced}} {{at the hands}} of opponents early in his NHL career {{prompted}} Iginla's coaches to work at developing his physical play. While he was not enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>fighting,</b> Iginla accepted then head coach Brian Sutter's arguments that he needed to adopt a more aggressive style to improve as a player. Iginla is most effective when he has room to manoeuvre, and to create that space, he had to intimidate his opponents. The lessons Iginla learned have carried throughout his career. [...] "You've got a power forward who does it all," [...] said Craig Conroy. [...] "I mean, he'll fight, and hit, and score goals. Maybe it's not the end-to-end rushes, but he does all those little things that win games and get things done." [...] His opponents also respect his play. Rob Blake said that while Iginla is not known for fancy play, [...] "he'll run you over. Or he'll fight somebody. And then he'll score a goal. He does pretty much everything you'd want a guy to do." ...|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+ rating and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, [...] "It's a rolling explosion of images as hypnotizing and sharply angled as any in a drawing by M. C. Escher or a state-of-the-biz video game; the backwards splicing of Nolan's own Memento looks rudimentary by comparison." [...] The New York Post gave the film a four-star rating and Lou Lumenick wrote, [...] "DiCaprio, who has never been better as the tortured hero, draws you in with a love story that will appeal even to non-sci-fi fans." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film a full four stars and said that Inception [...] "is all about process, <b>about</b> <b>fighting</b> our way through enveloping sheets of reality and dream, reality within dreams, dreams without reality. It's a breathtaking juggling act."

500|$|Suzuki {{described}} Miyazaki as {{a feminist}} {{in reference to}} his attitude to female workers.

Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind was lauded for its positive portrayal of women, particularly the protagonist Nausicaä. Schellhase noted that the female characters in Miyazaki's films are not objectified or sexualized, and possess complex and individual characteristics absent from Hollywood productions. Schellhase also identified a [...] "coming of age" [...] element for the heroines in Miyazaki's films, as they each discover [...] "individual personality and strengths". Gabrielle Bellot of The Atlantic wrote that, in his films, Miyazaki [...] "shows a keen understanding of the complexities of what it might mean to be a woman". In particular, Bellot cites Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, praising the film's challenging of gender expectations, and the strong and independent nature of Nausicaä. Bellot also noted that Princess Mononokes San represents the [...] "conflict between selfhood and expression".|$|E
