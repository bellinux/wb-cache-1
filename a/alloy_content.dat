40|$|A dilute {{solution}} model (with {{respect to}} the substitutional alloying elements) has been developed, which accurately predicts the hydride formation and decomposition thermodynamics and the storage capacities of dilute ternary Pd-Rh-Co alloys. The effect of varying the rhodium and cobalt compositions on the thermodynamics of hydride formation and decomposition and hydrogen capacity of several palladium-rhodium-cobalt ternary alloys has been investigated using pressure-composition (PC) isotherms. Alloying in the dilute regime (< 10 at. %) causes the enthalpy for hydride formation to linearly decrease with increasing <b>alloying</b> <b>content.</b> Cobalt has a stronger effect on the reduction in enthalpy than rhodium for equivalent alloying amounts. Also, cobalt reduces the hydrogen storage capacity with increasing <b>alloying</b> <b>content.</b> The plateau thermodynamics are strongly linked to the lattice parameters of the alloys. A near-linear dependence of the enthalpy of hydride formation on the lattice parameter was observed for both the binary Pd-Rh and Pd-Co alloys, {{as well as for}} the ternary Pd-Rh-Co alloys. The Pd- 5 Rh- 3 Co (at. %) alloy was found to have similar plateau thermodynamics as a Pd- 10 Rh alloy, however, this ternary alloy had a diminished hydrogen storage capacity relative to Pd- 10 Rh...|$|R
40|$|This study {{intends to}} better control the final {{composition}} of steel {{by trying to}} have a better knowledge of elements including copper, nickel, molybdenum, manganese, tin and chromium in the scrap. This objective was approached by applying probability and statistical concepts such as normal distribution, multiple linear regression and least square and non-negative least square concepts. The study was performed on the raw materials’ information of Ovako Smedjebacken and Ovako Hofors, two steel production plants in Sweden. The information included but were not limited to the amount of the different scrap types used in the charge, total weight of the charge and the final composition of the produced steel.   First, the concept of normal distribution was used as to consider the variations of the alloying elements between the estimated and measured <b>alloy</b> <b>contents.</b> The data were then used to consider a model for distribution factor of the studied elements. Also, an estimation of the <b>alloy</b> <b>contents</b> in the scrap type given the final steel composition was carried out using the concept of probability and statistics.

50|$|Carbon steels, with an <b>alloy</b> <b>content</b> {{less than}} or equal to 6%, are often pickled in {{hydrochloric}} or sulfuric acid. Steels with an <b>alloy</b> <b>content</b> greater than 6% must be pickled in two steps and other acids are used, such as phosphoric, nitric and hydrofluoric acid. Rust- and acid-resistant chromium-nickel steels are pickled in a bath of hydrochloric and nitric acid. Most copper alloys are pickled in dilute sulfuric acid, but brass is pickled in concentrated sulfuric and nitric acid mixed with sodium chloride and soot.|$|E

50|$|The {{addition}} of certain alloying elements, such as manganese and nickel, can stabilize the austenitic structure, facilitating heat-treatment of low-alloy steels. In the extreme case of austenitic stainless steel, much higher <b>alloy</b> <b>content</b> makes this structure stable even at room temperature. On the other hand, such elements as silicon, molybdenum, and chromium tend to de-stabilize austenite, raising the eutectoid temperature.|$|E
50|$|There are six {{groups of}} tool steels: water-hardening, cold-work, shock-resistant, high-speed, hot-work, and special purpose.

Also corrosion behavior of the Cu and Mg <b>content</b> <b>alloys</b> measured by the weight loss method is better {{than those of the}} Al- 9 Zn alloy.

50|$|Bainite is a plate-like {{microstructure}} {{that forms}} in steels at temperatures of 250-550 °C (depending on <b>alloy</b> <b>content).</b> First described by E. S.

This critical temperature is 1000 K (727 °C, 1340 °F) in plain carbon steels. Davenport and Bain originally described the microstructure as being similar in appearance to tempered martensite.|$|E
50|$|It {{has long}} been {{established}} that the addition of alloying elements significantly lowers the SFE of most metals. Which element {{and how much is}} added dramatically affects the SFE of a material. The figures on the right show how the SFE of copper lowers with the addition of two different alloying elements; zinc and aluminum. In both cases, the SFE of the brass decreases with increasing <b>alloy</b> <b>content.</b> However, the SFE of the Cu-Al alloy decreases faster and reaches a lower minimum.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{distinct}} {{advantages of the}} electroless nickel deposition process {{is the ability to}} produce an alloy of nickel and phosphorus in varying ratios.

40|$|The {{remarkable}} modification {{in physical}} and magnetic properties of ternary Ni, Cu and Al based ensemble of ball milled nanoparticle alloys and their crystalline shape with grain size and composition {{has been studied}} in the present paper. The onset of crystalline changes have been correlated to grain size and <b>alloying</b> <b>content.</b> A sharp decrease in ferromagnetism maintaining the cubic symmetry with grain size and alloying was also revealed. These alloys show two phase transitions, one near room temperature and the other near 80 °C compared to 200 °C for similar bulk compositions. Such observations have been explained and their possible usage is being explored...|$|R
30|$|The E 500 TMCP steel has a {{substantially}} lower amount of chromium, nickel, and copper {{compared to the}} F 500 W QT steels. Clearly, low amounts of chromium, nickel, and copper make the steel production cheaper and ease the welding process. The E 500 TMCP steel has lower values for both parameters, which define weldability: Pcm (0.19 vs 0.22) and Ceqv (0.41 vs 0.46). However, specific <b>alloying</b> <b>content</b> (%) over the plate thickness is even smaller for F 500 W 35  mm (0.013) compared to E 500 (0.016). These numbers might explain better the F 500 W 35 -mm welding performance. That {{is not the case}} with the ingot-made F 500 W 30  mm (0.020).|$|R

5000|$|In a mass {{production}} environment, or in a well equipped private shop, the blanking process {{is used to}} make [...] "blade blanks." [...] This {{can be achieved by}} a number of different methods, depending upon the thickness of the material and the <b>alloy</b> <b>content</b> of steel to be cut. Thinner cross section, lower alloy blanks can be stamped from sheet material. Materials that are more difficult to work with, or jobs that require higher production volume, can be accomplished with water jet cutters, lasers or electron beam cutting. These two lend themselves towards larger custom shops. Some custom knife makers cut their blanks from steel using a metal-cutting bandsaw.|$|E
50|$|Another {{factor that}} has a {{significant}} effect on the SFE of a material and is very interrelated with <b>alloy</b> <b>content</b> is the e/a ratio, or the ratio of valence electrons to atoms. Thornton showed this in 1962 by plotting the e/a ratio vs SFE for a few Cu based alloys. He found that the valence-electron to atom ratio is a good predictor of stacking fault energy, even when the alloying element is changed. This directly supports the graphs on the right. Zinc is a heavier element and only has two valence electrons, whereas aluminum is lighter and has three valence electrons. Thus each weight percent of aluminum has a much greater impact on the SFE of the Cu-based alloy than does zinc.|$|E
40|$|Self-passivating tungsten-based alloys are an {{attractive}} material for application in future fusion reactors, because they combine the favourable properties of tungsten with an enhanced passive {{safety in the}} case of a loss of coolant accident. Powder metallurgical technologies have been used to prepare binary or ternary tungsten based alloys as a bulk material to improve the oxidation resistance. Silicon and chromium were chosen as the alloying elements. Elemental powder mixtures, pre-alloyed powders as well as mechanically milled powders were prepared with different <b>alloying</b> <b>contents</b> and consolidated by pressure assisted sintering technologies (hot pressing).

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{variations}} in <b>alloying</b> <b>content</b> on the microstructure and mechanical properties of {{high strength steel}} weld metals have been studied. Based on neural network modelling, weld metals were produced using shielded metal arc welding with nickel at 7 or 9 wt. %, manganese at 2 or 0. 5 wt. % while carbon was varied between 0. 03 and 0. 11 wt. %. From mechanical testing, {{it was confirmed that}} a large gain in impact toughness could be achieved by reducing the manganese content. Carbon additions were found to increase strength with only a minor loss to impact toughness as predicted by the modelling. The highest yield strength (912 MPa) in combination with good impact toughness (over 60 J at – 100 oC) was achieved with an <b>alloying</b> <b>content</b> of 7 wt. % nickel, 0. 5 wt. % manganese and 0. 11 wt. % carbon. Based on thermodynamic calculations and observed segregation behaviour it was concluded that the weld metals solidify as austenite. The microstructure was characterised using optical, transmission electron and high resolution scanning electron microscopy. At interdendritic regions mainly martensite was found. In dendrite core regions of the low carbon weld metals a mixture of upper bainite, lower bainite and a novel constituent—coalesced bainite—formed. Coalesced bainite was characterised by large bainitic ferrite grains with cementite precipitates and is believed to form when the bainite and martensite start temperatures are close to each other. Carbon additions were found to promote a more martensitic microstructure throughout the dendrites. Mechanical properties could be rationalised in terms of microstructural constituents and a constitutional diagram was constructed summarising microstructure as a function of manganese and nickel contents...|$|R
50|$|Composition {{control of}} weld metal is often {{performed}} to maximise the volume fraction of acicular ferrite {{due to the}} toughness it imparts. During continuous cooling, higher <b>alloy</b> <b>contents</b> or faster cooling generally delay transformation, which will then take place at lower temperatures, below the bainite start temperature, and lead to higher hardness. The efficacy of inclusions as nucleation sites in modern low alloy steel weld metals is such that fine-scale intragranular bainite can nucleate on them, both by continuous cooling and by isothermal transformation below the bainite start temperature. Some confusion has arisen in the literature, as this fine-scale intragranular bainite, which can resemble acicular ferrite in appearance in the optical microscope, has been called acicular ferrite by some researchers. See, for example.|$|R
