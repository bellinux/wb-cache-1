5|$|According to Diodorus, some 7,000 Illyrians {{died in the}} battle. The Illyrians {{withdrew from}} Macedon and sued for peace.

5|$|After {{the failure}} and {{disappearance}} of the Hospitallers, {{the history of the}} region is shrouded in obscurity for decades. But the trend toward the unification of the Romanian polities seems to begin with Voivode Litovoi. He (or his namesake son) was <b>at</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Hungarians and killed in battle sometime between 1270 and 1280. In the battle, his brother, Bărbat was captured. Bărbat was forced not only to pay ransom but also to recognize Hungarian rule.|$|E

5|$|The Turks agreed, but Prime Minister Deligiannis refused and {{dispatched}} 1400 {{troops to}} Crete {{under the command}} of Colonel Timoleon Vassos. While the Great Powers announced a blockade, Greek troops crossed the Macedonian border and Abdul Hamid II declared war. The announcement that Greece was finally <b>at</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Turks was greeted by delirious displays of patriotism and spontaneous parades in honor of the King in Athens.

5|$|After Genghis Khan's {{death in}} 1227, his empire was divided by his {{descendants}} into four sections or Khanates, which degenerated into civil war. The northwestern Kipchak Khanate, {{known as the}} Golden Horde, expanded towards Europe, primarily via Hungary and Poland, while its leaders simultaneously opposed the rule of their cousins back at the Mongol capital. The southwestern section, known as the Ilkhanate, was {{under the leadership of}} Genghis Khan's grandson Hulagu. He continued to support his brother, the Great Khan, and was therefore <b>at</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Golden Horde, {{while at the same time}} continuing an advance towards Persia and the Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was <b>at</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E

5|$|In 968, Bulgaria was invaded {{from the}} north by the Kievan Prince Sviatoslav. By that time, the Bulgarian Empire, which had once {{threatened}} the existence of Byzantium under the reign of Simeon, had {{lost much of its}} power. During the conflict, the Kievan raids were repeatedly defeated by the Byzantines, who were also <b>at</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Bulgarians, a continuous conflict since the fall of the Bulgarian capital Preslav in 971. This war had resulted in the Bulgarian Emperor Boris II being forced to renounce his Imperial title in Constantinople, and eastern Bulgaria came under Byzantine rule. The Byzantines assumed that this act would signify the end of independent Bulgaria, but the western Bulgarian lands remained autonomous and under the Comitopuli brothers David, Moses, Aaron and Samuel, resistance against the Byzantines emerged.|$|E
5|$|Marco Polo {{returned}} to Venice in 1295 with his fortune converted into gemstones. At this time, Venice was <b>at</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Republic of Genoa.

He was probably caught by Genoans in a skirmish in 1296, off the Anatolian coast between Adana and the Gulf of Alexandretta and not {{during the battle of}} Curzola (September 1298), off the Dalmatian coast. The latter claim is due to a later tradition (16th Century) recorded by Giovanni Battista Ramusio.|$|E

5|$|Most of Demosthenes' major orations were {{directed}} against the growing power of King Philip II of Macedon. Since 357BC, when Philip seized Amphipolis and Pydna, Athens had been formally <b>at</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Macedonians. In 352BC, Demosthenes characterised Philip as the very worst enemy of his city; his speech presaged the fierce attacks that Demosthenes would launch against the Macedonian king over the ensuing years. A year later he criticised those dismissing Philip as a person of no account and warned that he was as dangerous as the king of Persia.|$|E

This delicate balance is undone when news arrives that Tyrion Lannister has been arrested by Catelyn Stark.

5|$|The {{expedition}} passed onwards through Kejache {{territory and}} reported that the Kejache towns were situated in easily defensible locations and were often fortified. One of these was built on a rocky outcrop near a lake and a river that fed into it. The town was fortified with a wooden palisade and {{was surrounded by a}} moat. Cortés reported that the town of Tiac was even larger and was fortified with walls, watchtowers and earthworks; the town itself was divided into three individually fortified districts. Tiac was said to have been <b>at</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> unnamed smaller town. The Kejache claimed that their towns were fortified against the attacks of their aggressive Itza neighbours.|$|E
5|$|The {{microstate}} of San Marino, in {{the northern}} Italian Peninsula and fully surrounded by Italy, had played little role throughout the Second World War. It had a fascist government, closely aligned with Benito Mussolini's regime, but remained neutral. It {{was reported to have}} declared war against the United Kingdom in September 1940, though the Sammarinese government later transmitted a message to the British government stating that it had not. In early 1942, the Sammarinese government reiterated it was not <b>at</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> United States, a position that was confirmed by the US State Department. The British Foreign Office noted more equivocally in 1944 that Britain had never declared war, but also had never formally recognised San Marino's neutrality, and that it felt that military action on Sammarinese territory would be justified if it were being used by Axis forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls were}} again {{restored}} under Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328) and again under his successor Andronikos III Palaiologos (r. 1328–1341), when, on 12 February 1332, a major storm caused breaches {{in the wall}} and forced the seaward gates open. In 1351, when the empire was <b>at</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Genoese, John VI Kantakouzenos again repaired the walls, and even opened a moat {{in front of the}} wall facing the Golden Horn. Other repairs are recorded for 1434, again against the Genoese, and again in the years leading up to the final siege and fall of the city to the Ottomans, partly with funds provided by the Despot of Serbia, George Brankovic.|$|E
