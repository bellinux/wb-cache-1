[...] "It's me singing Bobby and talking about Bobby and talking {{a little bit about}} the movie," [...] Spacey explained in June 2004. Spacey dressed in costumes from the movie for the tour, which started in San Francisco and traveled through Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, Chicago, Miami and Atlantic City before ending in the Wayne Newton Theatre at the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas. Spacey's performance at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on December 11, 2004 received a standing ovation. Dodd Darin commented, [...] "It was said about my dad that he had some big brass ones. To do a film about my dad is one thing, but it's another thing to go out and attempt to work a nightclub. Kevin's got <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>courage.</b> I think he sounds good." [...] The film was shown and promoted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2004.|$|E

We have {{got to deal with}} that". [...] BBC commentator and former Light Blue president Richard Phelps believed that Cambridge [...] "deserved" [...] the win and that [...] "it was the superior power and application of it that saw Cambridge slowly pull clear of Oxford". [...] Cambridge coach Robin Williams said [...] "It was a brave, quick decision by the umpire", while former Dark Blue and Olympic gold medallist Matthew Pinsent suggested the clash was simply a racing incident and that the race could have been allowed to continue. [...] He added: [...] "There is no yellow card offence between a warning and disqualification". [...] Oxford coach Sean Bowden blamed the defeat on the restart: [...] "We rowed with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>courage</b> ... but having to restart after that great first take-off really hurt us. It just put us at a disadvantage from then on".|$|E

"It {{seems to}} many of us that if we are to avoid the {{eventual}} catastrophic world conflict we must strengthen the United Nations as a first step toward a world government patterned after our own government with a legislature, executive and judiciary, and police to enforce its international laws and keep the peace. To do that, of course, we Americans will have to yield up some of our sovereignty. That would be a bitter pill. It would take <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>courage,</b> a lot of faith in the new order.

2500|$|In 2012, 16 {{years after}} her debut appearance, Kasumi was {{redesigned}} to look less cartoon-like and more realistic with a [...] "grown up" [...] appearance in DOA5. The game's art director Yuta Saito said, [...] "From DOA4 we wanted to evolve the characters in a slightly realistic direction. The most difficult, and you don't have to ask, is Kasumi. Kasumi {{is the face of}} DOA and the eternal heroine. And for such a popular character like Kasumi, to change her form we really needed <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>courage</b> and it really was a big challenge. But if we didn't do that, we couldn't make DOA5 and we wouldn't be able to show you anything." [...] Producer Yasuke Hayashi said the processn of remodeling Kasumi has sparked most disputes in the development team, especially since she is [...] "a character that is not so much out on the table, with [...] hidden feelings, and it's been difficult to express such a 'hidden look'." [...] GamesRadar noted that [...] "the manga influences on her facial featureswhile still apparenthave been scaled right back nd her boobs seem less ludicrously unmanageable." [...] Itagaki, who has left Team Ninja in 2008, said in 2014: [...] "Straightly speakin’, my daughter was totally ruined, spoiled. I can’t/shouldn’t avert my eyes from that fact.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of “Cold Fusion ” has been announced officially by {{a press conference}} on March 23 rd 1989 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The shock wave produced by the Pons and Fleischmann announcement is probably unique in history, {{due to the fact}} that emails and fax machines helped propagate the good and the bad news altogether at light speed. Hun-dreds laboratories around the world immediately tried to replicate the ex-periment. However, details of it were not well known and doing electro-chemistry and calorimetry altogether is a difficult art and takes time to mas-ter. Therefore most nuclear scientists tried to detect the assumed accompany-ing radiations produced by the well known reaction D+D producing either He- 3 and a neutron or tritium and a proton with equal probability. Not sur-prisingly no neutron or very little compared to the amount expected from the announced excess heat were detected. These types of approaches plus the unwillingness of a portion of the scientific community to accept that electro-chemistry under special conditions could produce nuclear reactions pushed “Cold Fusion ” in quasi clandestinity. Several hundred scientists worldwide did careful calorimetry experiments and showed that the effect was real. Certainly simple in the principles, but not necessarily easy to reproduce. Artifacts were numerous, and the sources of error or misinterpretation were many. With <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> patience, <b>courage</b> and stubbornness, they slowly made progresses, and finally got to a point where the conditions of reproducibility were reached. They met regularly at inter-national meetings, starting with Salt Lake City in 1990, and the last Interna-tional Conference on Cold Fusion was held in Boston in August 2003. Th...|$|R
