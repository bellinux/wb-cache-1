5|$|De Iniusta {{states that}} St-Calais was {{brought before the}} king and royal court for trial on 2 November 1088, at Salisbury, the king having confiscated the bishop's lands before the trial. At the trial St-Calais held that as a bishop {{he could not be}} tried in a secular court, and he refused to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> accusations. Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, {{presented}} the king's case, declaring that the confiscated lands had been held as fiefs, and thus St-Calais could be tried as a vassal, not as a bishop. St-Calais objected, and continued to refuse to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> allegations. After numerous conferences and discussions, the court held that St-Calais could be tried as a vassal in a feudal court. St-Calais then appealed to Rome, but his request was rejected by the king and the judges. Those judging the case held that because St-Calais never answered the formal accusation, and because he appealed to Rome, his fief, or the lands he held as a bishop, was forfeit.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile in Scranton, {{the office}} is left without a {{receptionist}}. Not wanting to get roped into being receptionist again, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) defies Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) orders to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> phone. With {{the rest of the}} staff similarly declining to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> phone, Andy is left with no choice but to take on the receptionist's role himself, and performs the job with unexpected gusto. He orders new magazines for the waiting area, cooks mini-pizzas as reception snacks, color-coordinates the desk, and brings in a mail cart to deliver mail. Pam and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) attempt {{to talk him out of}} his newfound enjoyment, believing it to be linked to his lingering feelings for Erin, to no success.|$|E

5|$|Akane {{was created}} to be a {{relatable}} character who would question the setting and <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> viewer's questions. Early in the show's development, the production staff planned the way Akane would mature throughout the story. Early critical reception to Akane has been mixed. Some critics saw her as typical new cop often seen in dramas; others criticized her as uninteresting. However, her growth in the story earned praise for becoming a highly appealing protagonist.|$|E

5|$|Before a {{decision}} was made to establish a harbour (now the second largest in Denmark) at Esbjerg in 1868, the area consisted of only a few farms. Esbjerg developed quickly with the population rising to 13,000 by 1901 and 70,000 by 1970. In addition to its fishing and shipping activities, it also became an important centre for agricultural exports. Over the years, many of the city's visitors have arrived by ferry from Harwich, Essex, England, but this service closed in September 2014 having run since 1875. The harbour facilities are being expanded to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> needs of the wind-turbine industry and container shipping traffic. Esbjerg is served by Esbjerg Airport with flights to Aberdeen, Scotland and Stavanger, Norway.|$|E
5|$|Citing {{the limited}} {{size of the}} market as the main {{impediment}} in economic growth, Nurkse reasons that an increase in productivity can create a virtuous circle of growth.

As Say's Law states, supply creates its own demand.|$|E

5|$|During {{a tour of}} the Philippines {{the month}} after the Yesterday and Today furore, the Beatles unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, Imelda Marcos, who had {{expected}} them to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. When presented with the invitation, Epstein politely declined on the band members' behalf, as it had never been his policy to accept such official invitations. They soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to taking no for an <b>answer.</b> <b>The</b> resulting riots endangered the group and they escaped the country with difficulty. Immediately afterwards, the band members visited India for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Each {{contestant}} had {{the same}} decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> question or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their question {{at the end of}} the tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.|$|E

Respectively, the toss-ups are valued at $1,000, $2,000, and $3,000. In addition to these, each game has a minimum of four rounds, with more played if time permits. Rounds 2 and 3 are respectively started by the next two contestants clockwise from the contestant who began round 1.|$|E
