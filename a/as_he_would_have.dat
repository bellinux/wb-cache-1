5|$|Initially, de Peyster {{had been}} {{selected}} to lead {{an assault on the}} breastworks outside the city, however the night before the assault he noticed the city aflame from a signal tower and informed General Weitzel. The men of the corps then entered the city unmolested. Admiral David Farragut later claimed that de Peyster was due as much credit <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> received had he actually taken the city by storming it, because doing it without bloodshed still carried the same intent.|$|E
5|$|The NHL {{expanded}} in 1967, doubling from 6 teams to 12. Among the new entries was the Minnesota North Stars. The new team's coach and general manager, Wren Blair, had scouted Masterton while {{he played with}} the US Nationals and purchased his NHL playing rights from the Canadiens. Masterton was {{the first player to}} sign with Minnesota, agreeing to a two-year contract. He said {{prior to the start of}} the 1967–68 season that being able to play in Minnesota was key <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been unlikely to consider an offer with any other team.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{is shown}} to be <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been {{high up in the}} mountains, as a mortal and imperilled man. While this seems in some way demeaning to Napoleon's figure (and {{contrasts}} in the extreme with David's version, which shows Napoleon impervious to the cold, and in a heroic light), Delaroche's artwork was not intended to portray him in a hostile or unbecoming way. Delaroche wanted to depict Napoleon as a credible man, who suffered and underwent human hardship too, on his most daring exploits, and felt that making him appear as he really {{would have been in the}} situation would by no means debase or diminish Napoleon's iconic status or legacy, but rather make him a more admirable person.|$|E

5|$|At {{the opening}} of the summer hard court swing Federer was {{defeated}} in the final of the Montreal Masters by Alexander Zverev after injuring his back during the match. Due to the injury, he opted to withdraw from the Cincinnati Masters to be fit for the US Open. This injury effectively cost him the #1 ranking <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> attained it by reaching the Cincinnati final, a tournament he has won seven times. Despite his withdrawal from Cincinnati, Federer had little time to recover for the US Open, and the back injury severely affected his practice sessions. Even from the start, he looked uncomfortable and it took him five sets to win each of the first two rounds against Frances Tiafoe and Mikhail Youzhny. His campaign at the US Open finally ended in the last 8, where he lost to Juan Martin del Potro in four sets. His game was hampered by unforced errors at crucial points in the match and even he admitted that he never felt {{he had a chance to}} win the tournament.|$|E
5|$|In 733, Bede {{travelled}} to York {{to visit}} Ecgbert, {{who was then}} bishop of York. The See of York was elevated to an archbishopric in 735, {{and it is likely}} that Bede and Ecgbert discussed the proposal for the elevation during his visit. Bede hoped to visit Ecgbert again in 734, but was too ill to make the journey. Bede also travelled to the monastery of Lindisfarne, and at some point visited the otherwise-unknown monastery of a monk named , a visit that is mentioned in a letter to that monk. Because of his widespread correspondence with others throughout the British Isles, and {{due to the fact that}} many of the letters imply that Bede had met his correspondents, it is likely that Bede travelled to some other places, although nothing further about timing or locations can be guessed. It seems certain that he did not visit Rome, however, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> mentioned it in the autobiographical chapter of his Historia Ecclesiastica. Nothhelm, a correspondent of Bede's who assisted him by finding documents for him in Rome, is known to have visited Bede, though the date cannot be determined beyond the fact that it was after Nothhelm's visit to Rome.|$|E
25|$|On 29 April 1891 {{there was}} a {{collision}} at Helmsdale railway station between a down mixed train from Inverness which ran into an engine which had arrived earlier. Major Marindin of the Board of Trade investigated {{and found that the}} driver Robert Lindsay deliberately ignored the signals <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had difficulty in restarting the train on the rising gradient of 1 in 59.|$|E

25|$|His {{international}} {{career was}} also affected by his strong Christian beliefs, as {{he refused to}} play on Sundays. Although he was selected for the 1987 and 1991 All Black World Cup squads, he missed three Sunday games in the 1991 tournament due to his religious beliefs. Jones was omitted from the 1995 squad <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been unavailable for the quarterfinal and semifinal games. He was once asked how a Christian such as himself could be such an uncompromising tackler. In reply he quoted a phrase from the Bible: is better to give than receive.|$|E
25|$|Some {{relatives}} of the victims in the case were {{taken aback by the}} announcement of a Crown appeal, especially because Attorney-General Wally Oppal had said a few days earlier that the prosecution would likely not appeal. Although Pickton had been acquitted on the first-degree murder charges, he was convicted of second-degree murder and received the same sentence <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> on first-degree murder convictions. The {{relatives of}} the victims expressed concern that the convictions would be jeopardized if the Crown argued that the trial judge had made errors. Opposition critic Leonard Krog criticized the Attorney-General for not having briefed the victims’ families in advance.|$|E
25|$|Figo left Real Madrid to join Italian club Internazionale in {{the middle}} of 2005 on a free {{transfer}} after his contract with Madrid had expired. This meant that Figo would finally be able to play for a club in Italy, something he had the chance to do before his move to Barcelona, but was scuppered due to a dispute between the two clubs interested, Juventus and Parma. During the middle of 2008, Figo's compatriot José Mourinho joined Inter on a managerial level. This has been said to please Figo, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> several Portuguese teammates during the remainder of his stay at Inter.|$|E

25|$|Plutarch relates several {{opinions}} {{on the end of}} Marius: one, from Posidonius, holds that Marius contracted pleurisy; Gaius Piso has it that Marius walked with his friends and discussed all of his accomplishments with them, adding that no intelligent man ought leave himself to Fortune. Plutarch then anonymously relates that Marius, having gone into a fit of passion in which he announced a delusion that he was in command of the Mithridatic War, began to act <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> on the field of battle; finally, ever an ambitious man, Marius lamented, on his death bed, that he had not achieved all of which he was capable, despite his having acquired great wealth and having been chosen consul more times than any man before him.|$|E
25|$|This rather {{straightforward}} {{account of}} the Ring's origins, however, has been disputed {{by a number of}} authorities, who accuse Wagner of deliberately distorting the facts so as to bring them into harmony with his own private version of history. The actual sequence of events, it seems, was not nearly as clear-cut <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> us believe. It was in October 1846 – some sixteen months before the February Revolution – that he first drew up a plan for a five-act drama based on the life of Friedrich Barbarossa. He may even have considered writing an opera on Siegfried as early as 1843, when he read Jacob Grimm's Deutsche Mythologie (German Mythology), or possibly in 1844, when he borrowed several works on the Nibelungs from the Royal Library in Dresden. As for Die Wibelungen, it would appear that he only started work on this essay in December 1848 at the earliest, finishing it sometime before 22 February 1849, when he read it to his friend Eduard Devrient.|$|E
25|$|Masude quickly {{climbed the}} Nikkatsu ranks {{to become a}} top director. The {{financial}} success of his star-studded action films, beginning with Yujiro Ishihara in Rusty Knife, ensured that studio heads would continue to assign him top stars and action films. He continued to write for his own films but mostly due to time constraints <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> preferred to hire other writers, which did {{after he left the}} studio. The films were made quickly and largely without studio supervision. In one example, Ishihara began drawing huge audiences with The Guy Who Started a Storm which was released during the 1957 New Years season. Theatre owners were displeased that there were no further Ishihara films scheduled before Golden Week of the following year. The studio then order Masuda to make a film with Ishihara in 10 days. Producer Takiko Mizunoe brought him a script by Shintarō Ishihara. Masuda found it much too long to be completed in the given time, rewrote it and then completed the film within 12 or 13 days.|$|E

60|$|The boy was {{not entirely}} alone, for there was the big black tabby-cat lying upon {{the floor in the}} kitchen, and the little yellow dog barking at the wagon as it drove away, and the big moolie-cow lowing in the pasture down by the brook. Animals are often very good company, and Bobby did not feel nearly <b>as</b> lonely <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>had</b> there been no living thing about the house.|$|R

500|$|Patrick Smith {{visited the}} {{restaurant}} in 2016; his review was later published in Business Insider. He {{said it was}} cheap and good, but not exceptional. He criticised the [...] "lack of context" [...] given to the restaurant, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> enjoyed seeing photos of the plane when it was in use as a passenger jet. Smith said [...] "Many restaurants have long and storied histories, but usually just in one place! Here's a restaurant that has literally been everywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{relationship}} with Lana Lang {{was one of}} Smallvilles central relationships. When Clark and Lana met in the cemetery, Clark {{realized that he had}} found someone who understood him, who he could talk to, even though it was not in as strong a way <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked. Although Clark felt close to Lana, his fear that she would [...] "... kick him out of her life ..." [...] if she learned his secret— that he came in the meteor shower that killed her parents— was strong enough to keep him from becoming as close to her as he wished. The lack of honesty caused issues between them. Judge Byun wondered how this Clark Kent would have room in his heart for Lois Lane later in life, as he had bounced back and forth between Lana and Chloe in the first season.|$|E

500|$|Due to lack {{of funds}} at the time (the building's initial budget doubled, ending up at $325,000 ($ in modern dollars) {{including}} furnishings), Richardson devoted most of his efforts to the building's exterior. A report from the Times Union states, [...] "There wasn't enough money for Richardson {{to do the job}} as thoroughly <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked. He said in his writing that if there wasn't sufficient money, he'd rather do it right on the outside and leave it to a future generation to finish the interior. The interior was finished by city architects a good 30 years after Richardson built it." [...] The interior was redesigned by Ogden and Gander in 1917. The mayor's office is {{on the first floor of}} the tower, the Council chamber and offices are on the building's second floor, and the city clerk's office is on the second floor of the tower. The mayor's office contains a painting of the city's first mayor, Pieter Schuyler.|$|E
500|$|Hesketh-Prichard and {{his mother}} {{returned}} to Great Britain soon after, and lived for a while at her parents' house, before moving to St Helier on Jersey for several years. His nickname was [...] "Hex", which he would bear throughout his life. They returned to the mainland that the boy might be educated at a prep school in Rugby. In 1887 he won a scholarship to Fettes College, Edinburgh; his entrance paper was an essay on [...] "Summer Sports". He excelled at sports there, particularly cricket, at which the school magazine described him as [...] "the best bowler we have had for a long time". He was invited to play for Scotland against South Africa, but declined <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been unable to play against Fette's rival Loretto School. After school, he studied law privately in Horsham, West Sussex. He passed the preliminary exam, though he would never practice as a solicitor.|$|E
500|$|Under Johnson's proposal, {{there would}} be no change in the cent or nickel, but the dime and quarter would be made with a clad composition, that is {{copper-nickel}} bonded to a core of pure copper; the half dollar would have 80 percent silver faces and the core would contain 21 percent silver. [...] The clad alloy had similar electrical properties to silver, and so would work in existing vending machines. He also sent the Treasury Staff Report on which his recommendations were based. [...] This report had been expected in February, but had been repeatedly delayed, in part because outgoing Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon felt that his successor should approve the plan, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to live with the consequences. The new secretary, Henry H. Fowler, had needed time to study the problem, further delaying the report's issuance. If adopted, the bill would reduce the need for silver in U.S. coinage by 90 percent.|$|E
