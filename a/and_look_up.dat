500|$|As a first-person shooter, the {{gameplay}} of Halo: Combat Evolved {{is fundamentally}} {{similar to that}} of its peers, focusing on combat in a 3D environment that is viewed almost entirely from a character's eye view. The player can move around <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>up,</b> down, left, or right. The game features vehicles, ranging from armored jeeps and tanks to alien hovercraft and aircraft, many of which can be controlled by the player. The game switches to a third-person perspective during vehicle use for pilots and mounted gun operators; passengers maintain a first-person view. The game's heads-up display includes a [...] "motion tracker" [...] that registers moving allies, [...] moving or firing enemies, and vehicles, in a certain radius of the player.|$|E

The band is shown playing along to [...] "Golden Retriever" [...] inside the box with Gruff Rhys wearing a red sports visor. Bassist Guto Pryce and keyboardist Cian Ciaran are both sat on settees with guitars on their laps which they are not playing. As the chorus begins the band transform into yetis and all begin playing [...] "Golden Retriever", several members headbanging in time with the track. The group wear their regular clothes for the second verse before the yeti costumes reappear for the second chorus. As the video ends the camera zooms out to show a Golden Retriever approach the box in an alleyway.
