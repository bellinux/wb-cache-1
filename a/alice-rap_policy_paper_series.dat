40|$|Abstract: As {{part of the}} Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s {{commitment}} to supporting efforts to revitalize the economy of Springfield, Massachusetts, this paper explores the causes of and potential remedies for the city’s low resident employment rates. When compared to {{the state as a}} whole and to other midsize New England cities, the share of employed city residents is low, particularly for residents of downtown Springfield and its nearby neighborhoods. By analyzing the availability of jobs across Springfield’s various neighborhoods and in nearby towns and cities, this paper’s goal is to learn why so few Springfield residents are employed, and thus to identify policy priorities to increase employment. This study finds that solving Springfield’s low resident employment rates will require a combination of new job creation, improved informational and physical access to jobs, and strengthening the citizenry’s job skills.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} means of enhancing women’s representation in new democracies is the use of gender quotas for elections. These can be applied in a variety of ways, all of which seek {{to increase the number of}} female candidates and elected parliamentarians. For Indonesia’s 2004 elections, a non-compulsory quota system was introduced in which political parties were asked to nominate 30 percent women in their lists of parliamentary candidates. However, the 2004 election still resulted in only a small proportion of women being elected to the national parliament (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat), East Java provincial parliament (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah Propinsi Jawa Timur) and Sidoarjo local parliament (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah Kabupaten Sidoarjo) : 11. 3 percent for the national parliament, 16 percent for East Java parliament and only 2. 2 percent for Sidoarjo parliament. These percentages are still far below the 30 percent demanded by women activists. This paper argues that the greatest obstacles to women’s election are found in the institutional design of electoral system and the structure of political parties. The semi-open list of proportional representation used in the 2004 election has encouraged stiff internal competition within parties. Party elites privilege providing winnable positions for themselves over women’s empowerment, placing many women in non-winnable positions. Consequently, women’s chances to be elected to parliament were very small. This paper elaborates the role played by Indonesia’s political parties and electoral rules in the representation of women in the 2004 - 2009 period. It concludes by suggesting some reforms to the existing quota system which could improve its operation in the future.

40|$|This is a report. The {{first two}} <b>policy</b> <b>papers</b> in this <b>series</b> {{explored}} {{the demand for}} further regulation of football from supporters. Taken together, they conclude that supporters have an acute understanding {{of the problems with}} current football governance and are highly critical of how it is governed at the top level. A number of suggestions were made to address the problems highlighted including reform, government intervention and increased supporter involvement. This paper explores the latter point in more detail. If supporters are to be more involved in football governance – {{and there has been a}} recent policy focus on the way that this could improve football governance – what form might this take? Are supporters seeking out opportunities to involve themselves in football governance, at their clubs or elsewhere? Calling for greater supporter involvement is an important step, but it is vital to gain a greater understanding of how supporters feel about this. Policy recommendations in the area (DCMS 2011, 2013) very much focus on the role of supporter trusts and the work of Supporters Direct. However, one of the findings is that there is a variety of avenues through which supporters would like to be involved with football, not necessarily club ownership via a supporters trust., This paper analyses the supporters’ extent of engagement with football governance themselves, and the dynamics around this. It further investigates the scope for supporter engagement and the potential barriers that fans see to their involvement by current governance structures.
