In August 1954, his mother gave birth to his first brother, Frank, whom he would remain fond of despite the seven-year <b>age</b> <b>gap.</b> Although his family was Roman Catholic, he took an early interest in the pre-Christian religions of Ancient Egypt and Classical Greece, which he read about in books. He began devising and performing his own rituals to the deities of these religions, sparking his lifelong interest in Contemporary Paganism.

Moffat did not imagine the character to be as beautiful as Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked herself out of the role by arguing that there should be an <b>age</b> <b>gap</b> between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. It first {{appeared}} from Copernicus Publications via [URL] deep ice cores, Dome Fuji (DF) and EPICA Dome C (EDC), drilled at remote dome summits in Antarctica, were synchronized to better understand their chronology. A total of 1401 volcanic tie points were identified covering the past 216 kyr. DFO 2006, the chronology for the DF core characterized by strong constraining by the O 2 /N 2 age markers, was compared with AICC 2012, the chronology for 5 cores including the EDC core, and characterized by glaciological approaches combining ice flow modelling with various age markers. The <b>age</b> <b>gaps</b> between the two chronologies are within 2 kyr, except at Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5. DFO 2006 gives ages older than AICC 2012, with peak values of the gap of 4. 5 and 3. 1 kyr at MIS 5 d and MIS 5 b, respectively. Accordingly, ratios of duration DFO 2006 /AICC 2012 are 85 % at a period from the late stage of MIS 6 to MIS 5 d and 114 % at a period from MIS 5 d to 5 b. We then compared the DFO 2006 with another chronology of the DF core, DFGT 2006, characterized by glaciological approaches with weaker constraining by age markers. Features of the DFO 2006 /DFGT 2006 <b>age</b> <b>gaps</b> are very similar to those of the DFO 2006 /AICC 2012 <b>age</b> <b>gaps.</b> This fact lead us to hypothesize that a cause of the systematic DFO 2006 /AICC 2012 <b>age</b> <b>gaps</b> at MIS 5 are associated with differences in the dating approaches. Besides, ages of speleothem records from China agreed well with DFO 2006 at MIS 5 c and 5 d but not at MIS 5 b. Thus, we hypothesize at least at MIS 5 c and 5 d, major sources of the gaps are systematic errors in surface mass balance estimation in the glaciological approach. Compatibility of the age markers should be carefully assessed in future.

40|$|Abstract—Face {{verification}} in {{the presence}} of age progression is an important problem that has not been widely addressed. In this paper, we study the problem by designing and evaluating discriminative approaches. These directly tackle verification tasks without explicit age modeling, which is a hard problem by itself. First, we find that the gradient orientation (GO), after discarding magnitude information, provides a simple but effective representation for this problem. This representation is further improved when hierarchical information is used, which results {{in the use of the}} gradient orientation pyramid (GOP). When combined with a support vector machine (SVM) GOP demonstrates excellent performance in all our experiments, in comparison with seven different approaches including two commercial systems. Our experiments are conducted on the FGnet dataset and two large passport datasets, one of them being the largest ever reported for recognition tasks. Second, taking advantage of these datasets, we empirically study how <b>age</b> <b>gaps</b> and related issues (including image quality, spectacles, and facial hair) affect recognition algorithms. We found surprisingly that the added difficulty of verification produced by <b>age</b> <b>gaps</b> becomes saturated after the gap is larger than four years, for gaps of up to ten years. In addition, we find that image quality and eyewear present more of a challenge than facial hair.
