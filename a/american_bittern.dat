During 1968 - 74, we regularly found upland nests of these three species while conducting duck nesting studies in planted fields of undisturbed grass-legume cover in the Dakotas (Duebbert and Lokemoen 1976). Our findings on nest densities, hatching success, site characteristics, clutch sizes, and other ecological factors are presented in this paper. A bib (1975) indicated that the three species discussed in the present paper, in all or {{a significant part of}} their range, currently exhibit potentially dangerous, apparently non-cyclical population declines. Our general observations in North Dakota over the past 20 years also suggest an alarming decrease in populations of these birds during the breeding season. We believe that these population declines may be correlated with the widespread destruction or degradation of essential nesting habitats as agriculture has become increasingly more intensive...|$|R

The Iowa records committee accepted them both as King Eiders. SWAINSON’S HAWKS. On 28 September 1986 we were traveling east on a gravel road 3 miles south and 2 miles west of Coleridge, Cedar County. In a 28 -minute period from 4 : 48 to 5 : 14 PM we observed a total of 166 Swainson’s Hawks flying out of the north-northwest into the south-southeast. —Dave and. Lois Stage, Laurel PRAIRIE GROUSE. Over the weekend of 11 and l 2 April 1987 Bill Huser, Jerry Probst, and I traveled to Center, Nebraska, to observe Sharp-tailed Grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus) and Greater Prairie-Chickens (T 2 ̆ 7 ympanuchus cupido) which were reported to be in the area. —Randall D. Williams, Sioux City, Iowa WHOOPING CRANE REPORT. The Fish and Wildlife Service office in Grand Island has released the record of Whooping Crane sightings in Nebraska in the spring of 1987. WINTERING KILLDEER. On 17 January 1987 John Manning and I saw a hardy, healthy Killdeer in a pasture that had a spring-fed pond and open water. —Duane Wolff, Norfolk CRESCENT LAKE NESTING RECORDS. The first known production of White-faced Ibis on Crescent Lake NWR was recorded in 1987 with not one but two successful nests discovered on Smith Lake. Refuge personnel documented and photographed a total of seven young. —Royce R. Huber, Refuge Manager, Ellsworth BLAIR BACKYARD BIRDING. On 22 August 1987 my father spotted a Ruby-throated Hummingbird in our backyard, and soon after that I saw two Wilson’s Warblers. Later on I saw another warbler, bluish-gray above and yellow below, prominent eye-ring, a hint of a band across the breast, and yellow feet, so I decided it was a Canada Warbler. And later the same day I saw about twenty Empidonax flycatchers and four more Wilson’s Warblers. And a week later we had a small warbler in our bird bath. The bird had very prominent wingbars, yellow below, light brown above, and when it flew it had white on the outside and around the tail like a Vesper Sparrow. We figured it to be a Pine Warbler. —Joel Jorgensen, Blair BLUEBIRD NEST BOXES. In 1985, Boy Scout Troop 18 of Gering made 150 bluebird nesting boxes as a conservation project and in honor of scouting’s 75 th anniversary. In the early spring the Boy Scouts, along with members of the Wildcat Audubon Society, placed 115 of these nesting boxes in the Wildcat Hills south of Gering as a Mountain Bluebird trail. —Alice Kenitz, Gering LEWIS’ WOODPECKER DOESN 2 ̆ 7 T QUALIFY. The Bill Lemburgs saw a Lewis’ Woodpecker from US 83, within the Waterfowl Refuge, on their way home from the 1987 Annual Meeting. It was just a little after noon, and so outside the official count period. ONE OF OUR COWBIRDS IS MISSING. All winter long three Cowbirds, one male and two females, were staying in my one feedlot. On cold days they would huddle on the back of a fat heifer. The cow and birds both looked content. Then on 20 January 1987 a Cooper’s Hawk showed up, slowly moving over and around the cattle. Since then only the male and one female are around. —Duane Wolff, Norfol...|$|R
40|$|This {{summer was}} marked by {{continuing}} high water tables along the Missouri River and good water levels in the eastern Rainwater Basin. As a result, <b>American</b> and Least <b>Bitterns,</b> King Rail, Common Moorhen, and several American Coot nests in Sarpy Co were reported. However, Great and Snowy Egrets were scarce, and Black-necked Stilts were absent from the eastern Rainwater Basin after several good breeding years there. First breeding records for the state are always exciting; Lesser Goldfinch finally took the plunge this year in Banner Co. Also encouraging were increased reports of Black-billed Cuckoo (9) and both Black-billed Magpie and Black-capped Chickadee. Mountain Plovers are present in southwest Kimball Co in surprising numbers, with excellent conservation work being done there. The group responsible for the effort has an excellent Facebook site (see species account). Significant breeding records were made for Burrowing Owl, Long-eared Owl, and Brewer 2 ̆ 7 s Blackbird. Strangely, three species of migrant warblers were found in midsummer: Orange-crowned, Nashville, and Blackburnian, {{as well as a}} late June White-crowned Sparrow. Dickcissels again made a good showing in the west. Other eastern birds far west included Eastern Wood-Pewee and Summer Tanager. On the other hand, the earliest ever Rufous Hummingbird {{in the eastern part of}} the state was in Lincoln. True rarities were few: a Black-bellied Whistling-Duck and a summer American Black Duck were probably the best...|$|R
