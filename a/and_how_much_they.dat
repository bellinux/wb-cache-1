25|$|The Economist {{published}} in 2015 its first US college rankings, focused on comparable economical advantages defined as 'the economic {{value of a}} university {{is equal to the}} gap between how much its students subsequently earn, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>they</b> might have made had they studied elsewhere'. Based on set of strict criteria sourced from US Department of Education ("College Scorecard") with relevant 'expected earnings' and multiple statistics applied in calculation of 'median earnings' conclusive evaluation method has been applied to run the scorecard's earnings data through a multiple regression analysis, a common method of measuring the relationships between variables.|$|E
25|$|A state's {{tax system}} often {{reflects}} its communal {{values and the}} values of those in current political power. To create a system of taxation, a state must make choices regarding {{the distribution of the}} tax burden—who will pay taxes <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>they</b> will pay—and how the taxes collected will be spent. In democratic nations where the public elects those in charge of establishing or administering the tax system, these choices reflect the type of community that the public wishes to create. In countries where the public does not have a significant amount of influence over the system of taxation, that system may reflect more closely the values of those in power.|$|E

25|$|Martin {{provides}} {{a variety of}} female characters to explore some of the ramifications of the novels being set in a patriarchal society. Martin says that he wrote all characters as human beings with the same basic needs, dreams and influences, and that his female characters are to cover the same wide spectrum of human traits like the males. Martin claims to identify with all point-of-view characters {{in the writing process}} despite significant differences to him, be it gender or age. He sees himself neither as misogynistic or a promoter of feminism, although he acknowledged that some values inoculated within childhood can never be fully abandoned, even those consciously rejected. He says that he appreciates the discussions whether the series is feminist or anti-feminist, and is very gratified of the many female readers <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>they</b> like {{at least some of the}} female characters. He says that he does not presume to make feminist statements in either way. Martin's books frequently depict and refer to rape and humiliation, most cases of which are perpetrated upon women.|$|E
25|$|To {{a certain}} degree, kings acted {{as agents of}} the law. However, while other kings in Europe were able to {{promulgate}} law, such as Alfred the Great and his Doom book, the Irish had very little authority to do so. They could collaborate on law authored by the church. Cáin Adomnáin has the names of many kings attached to it who apparently enacted and enforced the law. Additionally, a king could issue a temporary law in times of emergency. But kings could not, by their own authority, issue permanent law codes. Kings also acted as judges, although {{the extent of their}} power compared to that of professional jurists has been debated. One law tract, Gubretha Caratniad, describes a brithem giving advice to a king (in this case, advice that seems flawed but is actually correct) who then gives it as judgment in a case. It is unclear, therefore, how much kings made judgments by themselves <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>they</b> had to follow professional advice. It is clear, however, that a king had to judge in accordance with the laws. However, the kings do not appear to have stood as judges in all cases, and in some cases the professional jurists took that role.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, {{after years}} of delays and legal proceedings, Continental started flights between Houston and Miami, and on May 21, 1976, Continental was {{authorized}} to operate long-sought routes between San Diego and Denver. President Jimmy Carter and Civil Aeronautics Board chairman Alfred Kahn had been promoting deregulation of the airline industry, which would dissolve the CAB {{and for the first}} time in industry history allow U.S. carriers to determine without government supervision where they would fly, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>they</b> could charge. Continental began flights from Denver to Miami/Ft. Lauderdale and Tampa/St. Petersburg in Florida. That year, President Carter authorized Continental to begin daily round trips between Air Micronesia destination Saipan and Japan, and approved a route for Continental from Los Angeles to Australia via Honolulu, American Samoa, Fiji, New Zealand and Australia. The South Pacific service began May 1, 1979. After the 1978 passage of the Airline Deregulation Act Continental embarked on a route expansion. October 1978 saw Continental begin flights from the New York area airports to Houston and Denver, and from Denver to Phoenix. That month Continental started DC-10 flights between Los Angeles and Taipei, via Honolulu and Guam. Service between Houston and Washington, D.C., began in January 1979. In June 1979 Continental linked Denver with Washington, D.C., Las Vegas, San Francisco and San Jose and also began Houston-Tampa service. The airline suffered in 1979 when the DC-10 was grounded nationwide. Continental Airlines only operated the DC-10 and the 727 at the time, so flights to Hawaii were cancelled during the grounding. By the time of the Texas Air Corp. acquisition in 1981, Continental's post-deregulation growth had allowed it to penetrate every major U.S. airline market (and all of the regional markets) from the hubs in Denver and Houston, with the corresponding expansion of facilities at both of these airports. In Denver, Continental's rapid growth provided the final impetus for the construction of the new Denver International Airport, which would be completed almost fifteen years later.|$|E

500|$|Before {{reaching}} Cyrus, {{the song}} had {{been rejected by}} several country artists. It was eventually picked up by Peter Chelsom, director of Hannah Montana: The Movie, who gave it to Cyrus to record for the film. Chelsom found what would become [...] "The Climb" [...] while visiting Nashville, Tennessee, during a quest to find eleven new songs for Hannah Montana: The Movie. After hearing Alexander's music, Chelsom asked her to submit songs for consideration. Alexander recorded [...] "It's the Climb" [...] on a CD {{and gave it to}} him. Several weeks later, Chelsom called to say that [...] "the song was gonna {{be an integral part of}} the movie". However, he wanted Mabe and Alexander to rework some of the song's content and to change the song from third person to first person. Alexander felt the changes amounted to a [...] "substantial amount of the song" [...] and commented, [...] "For me, when you change something from third person to first person, it can change the whole meaning of a line." [...] She and Mabe [...] "wrestl over taking words out" [...] <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>they</b> could change while maintaining the song's integrity.

2500|$|As a sign {{language}} develops, it sometimes borrows elements from spoken languages, just as all languages borrow from other languages {{that they are}} in contact with.

[...] In many {{sign language}}s, a manual alphabet (fingerspelling) may be used in signed communication to borrow a word from a spoken language, by spelling out the letters. This is most commonly used for proper names of people and places; it is also used in some languages for concepts for which no sign is available at that moment, particularly if the people involved are to some extent bilingual in the spoken language. Fingerspelling can sometimes be a source of new signs, such as initialized signs, in which the handshape represents the first letter of a spoken word with the same meaning.|$|E
2500|$|During filming, {{fourteen}} different {{horses were}} used as the main horse character Joey, eight of them portraying him as an adult animal, four as a colt and two as foals; four horses played the other main equine character, Topthorn. Up to 280 horses were used in a single scene. A farrier was on set to replace horseshoes sucked off in the mud during filming, and the horses playing the main horse characters had a specialist equine make-up team, with their coats dyed and markings added to ensure continuity. Equine artist Ali Bannister {{was responsible for the}} 'hair and make-up' of the horses, as well as drawing the sketches of horses that are featured in the film. Extra filming involving a bay foal took place in California in March 2011.

As the Don, this player can drop waypoints anywhere, directing their teammates to strategic areas. Additionally, specific areas of the map, called [...] "capture nods," [...] can be controlled by either team. Once controlled by a team, the Don can activate the nod to do one of three things; give a health boost, give an armored vest, or explode when members of the enemy team approach. The mode also lets Dons wager in-game cash prior to the commencement of the battle. Dons sets the amount they wish to wager, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>they</b> will give to their team should they win.
