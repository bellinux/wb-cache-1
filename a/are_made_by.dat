5|$|In many plants, {{defensive}} or {{storage structures}} <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> modifications {{of the development}} of primary leaves, stems, and roots. Leaves are variously modified from photosynthetic structures to form the insect-trapping pitchers of pitcher plants, the insect-trapping jaws of Venus flytrap, and the spines of cactuses, all homologous.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that some trees are interconnected through their root system, forming a colony. The interconnections <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the inosculation process, a kind of natural grafting or welding of vegetal tissues. The tests to demonstrate this networking are performed by injecting chemicals, sometimes radioactive, into a tree, and then checking for its presence in neighbouring trees.|$|E

5|$|The Forth Road Bridge is a {{suspension}} bridge in east central Scotland. The bridge, opened in 1964, spans the Firth of Forth, connecting Edinburgh, at Queensferry, to Fife, at North Queensferry. It replaced a centuries-old ferry service to carry vehicular traffic, cyclists and pedestrians across the Forth; railway crossings <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the adjacent Forth Bridge, opened in 1890.|$|E

5|$|After {{the tests}} have been satisfactorily completed, a {{cylinder}} passing the test will be marked accordingly. Stamp marking {{will include the}} registered mark of the inspection facility and the date of testing (month and year). Records of a periodic inspection and test <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the test station and kept available for inspection. These include: If a cylinder fails inspection or testing and cannot be recovered, the owner must be notified before making the empty cylinder unserviceable.|$|E
5|$|Californium-249 {{is formed}} from the beta decay of berkelium-249, {{and most other}} {{californium}} isotopes <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> subjecting berkelium to intense neutron radiation in a nuclear reactor. Although californium-251 has the longest half-life, its production yield is only 10% due to its tendency to collect neutrons (high neutron capture) and its tendency to interact with other particles (high neutron cross-section).|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} cheeses require {{inoculation}} of milk curds with fungal species that impart a unique flavor and texture to the cheese. Examples include the blue color in cheeses such as Stilton or Roquefort, which <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> inoculation with Penicillium roqueforti. Molds used in cheese production are non-toxic {{and are thus}} safe for human consumption; however, mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxins, roquefortine C, patulin, or others) may accumulate because of growth of other fungi during cheese ripening or storage.|$|E
50|$|A Cantopop {{version of}} this song called Missing You in this Lifetime (一生掛念你) <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> Hacken Lee. A Cajun version <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> Jamie Bergeron and the Kickin Cajuns.|$|R
50|$|Golden <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> mixing {{limestone}} {{and golden}} limestone in same amounts. Or else it <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> mixing limestone with milk of CLUSIACEAE, mercury, white lead, Seenakkaran, and Salt.|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} production {{companies were}} involved. Series 1 <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> Spelthorne Productions, {{which has since}} closed. Series 2 and 3 <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> Elizabeth Bennett's production company Tricorn Associates.|$|R
5|$|Deimatic {{displays}} <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> insects {{including the}} praying mantises (Mantidae) and stick insects (Phasmatodea). While undisturbed, these insects are usually well camouflaged. When disturbed by a potential predator, they suddenly reveal their hind wings, which are brightly coloured. In mantises, the wing display is sometimes reinforced by showing brightly coloured front legs, {{and accompanied by}} a loud hissing sound created by stridulation. For example, the grasshopper Phymateus displays red and yellow areas on its hind wings; it is also aposematic, producing a distasteful secretion from its thorax. Similarly the threat display of the walking stick phasmid (Peruphasma schultei) is not a bluff: the insect sprays defensive dolichodial-like monoterpene chemical compounds at attackers.|$|E
5|$|Fatty acids <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> {{fatty acid}} synthases that {{polymerize}} and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by {{a cycle of}} reactions that add the acyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups: in animals and fungi, all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional type I protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate type II enzymes perform each step in the pathway.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{as part of}} the Tawani Foundation 2008 Antarctic International Expedition (see below), Dale Andersen and Ian Hawes {{discovered}} conical stromatolites {{growing in}} Lake Untersee, the largest living ones known to date. Small microbial pinnacles are also present, and it appears that the large conical stromatolites and the small pinnacles <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> different microbial communities. These communities provide an important analog to some of the oldest fossil stromatolites found to date.|$|E

50|$|Bismuth-213 {{is one of}} the {{isotopes}} {{which has}} been used: this <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the alpha decay of actinium-225, which in turn <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the irradiation of radium-226 with a cyclotron.|$|R
