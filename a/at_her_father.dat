Lisa wants the tea but Homer, scoffs at the tea and demands the antacids.

500|$|Following the {{commercial}} and critical success of her 1986 album, Control, Jackson was motivated to continue songwriting and took {{a larger role in}} the creative production of her new album. Executives at A requested that she expand on the ideas presented on Control, suggesting a concept album entitled Scandal that would have been about the Jackson family. She wrote a song titled [...] "You Need Me" [...] which was directed <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> Joseph, but was unwilling to devote an entire album to the subject and substituted her own concept for theirs. She commented that [...] " [...] lot of people wanted me to do another album like Control and that's what I didn't want to do. I wanted to do something [...] that I really believed in and that I really felt strong about." [...] The concept of Rhythm Nation emerged as Jackson was a TV watcher, [...] "We would watch BET, MTV... then switched over to CNN, and there'd always be something messed-up happening. It was never good news, always bad news", producer James [...] "Jimmy Jam" [...] Harris recalled. [...] "State of the World" [...] was one of these songs, influenced by TV and news. Jam recalled that with the song, they were trying to do something like Marvin Gaye's song [...] "What's Going On" [...] although we never could hope to achieve that, but still wanted to make people aware of what was happening in a way they could dance to it. Released on February 6, 1991, [...] "State of the World" [...] was the eighth and the final single of Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814. The record label reckoned that they would boost album sales with a radio-only promotion.|$|E
500|$|A {{decade after}} her {{marriage}} to Cole, Victoria marries Brad Carlton (Don Diamont); their marriage ends after Brad has an affair. She then becomes pregnant with J.T. Hellstrom's (Thad Luckinbill) child and during her pregnancy becomes comatose. Heinle believed Victoria and J.T. would [...] "stay together {{for a while before}} they wreck it". After it was announced that Luckinbill was leaving the soap opera, Victoria and J.T. drift apart and eventually divorce. Victoria next begins a relationship with Billy Abbott that their feuding families are against; Heinle described Billy as [...] "the forbidden fruit" [...] and compared their romance to Romeo and Juliet. They later marry in a 1950s-styled screen wedding; her wedding dress was inspired by a gown worn by Audrey Hepburn in the film Funny Face. Actress Elinor Donahue was cast to portray the judge that officiates their wedding, as former co-head writer Scott Hamner felt that Donahue could help them achieve the sense of a [...] "retro-fantasy of better, simpler times". After their wedding, Billy illegally purchases a baby girl for Victoria. Heinle felt this plot was a good way to conflict drama to the soap opera. The couple lose custody of the child, Billy leaves Genoa City and Victoria divorces him, but her father hides Billy from his family. The pair are later reunited in a New York airport bar. Hamner noted that Victoria would be [...] "absolutely furious" [...] <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> for what he had done: [...] " [...] potential for a huge rift between father and daughter, and there will be some consequences for Victor with his relationship with Victoria in light of all that he's done to keep her apart from the man she loves." [...] He also stated that the [...] "impact of those secrets coming to light was going to be very serious in Billy and Victoria's ability to move forward together".|$|E

2500|$|A critic from Channel 4 wrote: [...] "Koirala... {{demonstrates}} {{the full range}} of her acting ability, rather than playing against it as she has had to do in more traditional films. The scene where she shouts <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> through the door, screaming and using sign language even though she knows he can neither see nor hear her, is extremely powerful." [...] Filmfare magazine later included her performance in the film on its [...] "80 Iconic Performances" [...] list. In 1997, she played the leading role alongside Kajol and Bobby Deol in the thriller , {{which was one of the}} biggest hits that year.|$|E
2500|$|Noriko calmly accepts this {{sexual content}} when couched in the [...] "archaic" [...] form of Noh drama, {{but when she}} sees her father nod politely to the {{attractive}} widow, Mrs. Miwa, who {{is also in the}} audience, [...] "that strikes Noriko as outrageous and outraging. Had this woman and her father arranged to meet at this play about sexuality? Is this remarriage 'filthy' like [...] remarriage? She feels both angry and despairing. She is so mad <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> that, quite uncharacteristically, she angrily walks away from him after they leave the theater." [...] Holland thus sees one of the film's main themes as [...] "the pushing of traditional and inhibited Noriko into marriage." ...|$|E

With special powers from Mrs Who's glasses, Dr. Murry is able to [...] "tesser" [...] Calvin, Meg and himself away from Camazotz, but Charles Wallace is left behind, still under the influence of IT. Dr. Murry does not know how to protect Meg from the Black Thing which surrounds the planet as they tesser through it, which nearly kills her. When they arrive on the neighboring planet of Ixchel, Meg is nearly frozen, and paralyzed. Calvin and the Murrys are discovered by the planet's inhabitants - large, sightless [...] "beasts" [...] with tentacles and four arms, who prove both wise and gentle. Meg's paralysis is cured under the care of one inhabitant, whom Meg nicknames [...] "Aunt Beast." [...] Meg overcomes her anger <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> for leaving Charles Wallace on Camazotz, realizing that parents can't fix everything, and sometimes children can solve problems themselves.|$|E

Having had enough, Slim plans her escape with her friend's help. However, while {{escaping}} late at night, Mitch foils her plan by breaking out of a closet he is hiding in and grabbing her by the hair.

Then Mitch threatens them with a gun, before Phil (Christopher Maher) picks up Gracie to use as a witness while exhorting her to look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>father.</b> Unable to shoot the man with Gracie watching him, Mitch lets Slim escape. Slim retreats to a cheap motel, having had her credit cards frozen by Mitch. However, they are only there for a short time before Mitch tracks them down. Slim then goes on the run to Seattle where she briefly stays with her old boyfriend Joe (Dan Futterman). Some of Mitch's friends, disguised as FBI agents, show up at Joe's house claiming to investigate a [...] "kidnapping."
