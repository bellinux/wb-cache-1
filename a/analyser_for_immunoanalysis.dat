40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the experimental bootstrapping {{of the development}} of broad-coverage finite-state morphological <b>analysers</b> <b>for</b> Xhosa, Swati and (Southern) Ndebele by using an existing prototype of a morphological <b>analyser</b> <b>for</b> Zulu. These languages are both morphologically complex and resource-scarce. The research question is whether bootstrapping is feasible across the language boundaries between these closely related varieties. The objective is an assessment of the recognition rates yielded by the Zulu morphological <b>analyser</b> <b>for</b> the three related languages. The strategy is to use bootstrapping techniques that consist of the following steps: applying the analyser to corpus data from all languages, identifying (types of) failures, and implementing the respective changes in the analyser. The results show that the high degree of shared typological properties and formal similarities among the Nguni varieties warrants a modular bootstrapping approach. Word forms in these languages that were recognized by the Zulu analyser were mostly adequately analysed. Therefore, the focus lies on providing the necessary adaptations based on an analysis of the failure output for each language. As a result, the development of <b>analysers</b> <b>for</b> Xhosa, Swati and Ndebele is considerably faster than the creation of the Zulu prototype. The paper concludes with comments on the feasibility of the experiment, and the results of the evaluation. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of {{natural language processing}} (NLP) components is resource-intensive and therefore justifies exploring ways of reducing development time and effort when building NLP components. This paper addresses the experimental fast-tracking of the {{development of}} finite-state morphological <b>analysers</b> <b>for</b> Xhosa, Swati and (Southern) Ndebele by using an existing prototype of a morphological <b>analyser</b> <b>for</b> Zulu. The research question is whether fast-tracking is feasible across the language boundaries between these closely related varieties. The objective is a thorough assessment of the recognition rates yielded by the Zulu morphological <b>analyser</b> <b>for</b> the three related languages. The strategy is to use fast-tracking techniques that consist of several cycles of the following steps: applying the analyser to corpus data from all languages, identifying (types of) failures, and implementing the respective changes in the analyser. The tests show that the high degree of shared typological properties and formal similarities among the Nguni varieties warrants a modular fast-tracking approach. Those word forms in these languages that were recognized by the Zulu analyser were mostly adequately interpreted. Therefore, the focus lies on providing the necessary adaptations based on an analysis of the failure output for each language. As a result, the development of <b>analysers</b> <b>for</b> Xhosa, Swati and Ndebele is considerably faster than the creation of the Zulu prototype.

40|$|Conceptually, finite-state {{approaches}} are {{well suited to}} the modelling and implementation of regular linguistic (in this case morphophonological) behaviour. However, it is common knowledge that, while morphophonological phenomena are mainly regular, the development of large coverage morphological <b>analysers</b> <b>for</b> real natural languages also requires the accurate modelling of idiosyncratic behaviour. In this paper it is firstly shown how linguistic constraints in an agglutinative language such as Zulu, can be handled in a Xerox style finite-state computational morphological analysis by means of so-called/a g diacritics. Secondly, {{the use of multiple}} levels of finite-state transducers for the analysis/generation of certain forms of idiosyncratic behaviour is discussed {{within the context of the}} development of a large coverage morphological <b>analyser</b> <b>for</b> Zulu that is both efficient and accurate.

40|$|Abstract. The {{modeling}} {{and analysis of}} hybrid systems is a recent and challenging research area which is actually dominated by two main lines: a functional analysis based on {{the description of the}} system in terms of discrete state (hybrid) automata (whose goal is to ascertain for confor-mity and reachability properties), and a stochastic analysis (whose aim is to provide performance and dependability measures). This paper inves-tigates a unifying view between formal methods and stochastic methods by proposing an analysis methodology of hybrid systems based on Fluid Petri Nets (FPN). It is shown that the same FPN model can be fed to a functional <b>analyser</b> <b>for</b> model checking as well as to a stochastic <b>analyser</b> <b>for</b> performance evaluation. We illustrate our approach and show its use-fulness by applying it to a “real world ” hybrid system: the temperature control system of a co-generative plant. ...|$|R

Special attention {{is given to the}} so-called “open ” class, which represents the word root lexicons for specifically nouns and verbs. The acquisition and coverage of these lexicons prove to be crucial for the success of the analysers under development. The bootstrapped morphological analyser is applied to parallel test corpora and the results are discussed. A variety of cross-linguistic effects is illustrated with examples from the corpora. It is found that bootstrapping morphological <b>analysers</b> <b>for</b> languages that exhibit significant structural and lexical similarities may be fruitfully exploited <b>for</b> developing <b>analysers</b> <b>for</b> lesser-resourced languages. ...|$|R
