40|$|E. S. R. {{investigations}} of γ-irradiated ferroelectric Sodium <b>ammonium</b> <b>selenate,</b> NaNH 4 SeO 4 • 2 H 2 O and its deuteriated analogue in powder and single crystal forms {{have led to}} {{a deeper understanding of the}} nature of the ferroelectric transition of 180 K. A number of paramagnetic species formed due to γ-irradiation have been identified on the basis of their g-factors and hyperfine features from 77 Se. The radical SeO 4 has been used as a microprobe in studying the phase transition...|$|E
40|$|The Raman and {{infrared}} absorption spectra of sodium <b>ammonium</b> <b>selenate</b> dihydrate (SASD) {{have been recorded}} both {{above and below the}} ferroelectric transition temperature. The deuterated SASD has also been investigated. The results support the view that while there is only one type of NH 4 + ions in the para electric phase, {{there are two types of}} NH 4 + ions below Tc. The water molecules undergo considerable change and non-equivalent O-H bonds are produced below Tc. The SeO 2 / 4 - ions undergo very little change...|$|E
40|$|EPR {{experimental}} results obtained for SASeD doped with Cr 3 + are reported with {{special emphasis on}} those observations which reveal the effect of soft modes i. e. the temperature dependence of the DZZ spin-Hamiltonian parameter and the temperature dependence of the EPR linewidth. An extension of the two-sublattice model, previously developed and tested for SASD, to include lattice vibrations is presented. The obtained spectrum of bound excitations for the system investigated supports the idea that soft modes contri-bute to the phase transition at TC = 175 K. The anomaly detected at T 1 = 150 K has only a quasisoft mode character and the anomaly detected at T 2 = 280 K cannot {{be related to the}} effect of soft modes.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of}} human {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} has been refined to a crystallographic residual of 16. 1 % at 1. 6 A resolution. The structure has a Kunitz-type fold and {{is composed of}} 12 antiparallel beta-strands, 6 of which form a beta-barrel. One bound sulfate ion has been identified in the model, hydrogen bonded to the side chains of Asn 27, Arg 120, and Lys 125. The side chain of Arg 120 has two conformations, both of which permit hydrogen bonds to the sulfate. This sulfate binding site has been suggested as the binding site for heparin (Eriksson, A. E., Cousens, L. S., Weaver, L. H., & Matthews, B. W., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 3441 - 3445). Two beta-mercaptoethanol (BME) molecules are also included in the model, each forming a disulfide bond to the S gamma atoms of Cys 69 and Cys 92, respectively. The side chain of Cys 92 has two conformations of which only one can bind BME. Therefore the BME molecule is half occupied at this site. The locations of possible sulfate binding sites on the protein were examined by replacing the ammonium sulfate in the crystallization medium with <b>ammonium</b> <b>selenate.</b> Diffraction data were measured to 2. 2 A resolution and the structure refined to an R-factor of 13. 8 %. The binding of the more electron-dense selenate ion was identified at two positions. One position was identical to the sulfate binding site identified previously. The second selenate binding site, which is of lower occupancy, is situated 5. 6 A from the first. This ion is hydrogen bonded by the side chain of Lys 135 and Arg 120. Thus the side chain of Arg 120 binds two selenate ions simultaneously. It is suggested that the observed second selenate binding site should also be considered as a possible binding site for heparin, or that both selenate binding sites might simultaneously contribute to the binding of heparin...|$|E
