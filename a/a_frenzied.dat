5|$|At the lek, {{males have}} been {{observed}} to break up into pairs, performing “confrontation displays”. This consists of facing each other while bowing, jumping, and flapping their wings, sometimes even snapping their bills, {{and at the same}} time giving off various squawking and grunting calls. When the female approaches, it becomes even more intense. The display turns into a cacophony of bright color and <b>a</b> <b>frenzied</b> activity filling the air with very strange sounds.|$|E
5|$|At {{the science}} fair, Steve causes a panic by announcing his pet {{tarantula}} has escaped, and Carly Beth is terrified of tarantulas. Steve creeps {{up behind her}} during the chaos, and pinches her leg {{to make it seem}} that the tarantula is biting her. Carly Beth flies into <b>a</b> <b>frenzied</b> panic, destroys her and Sabrina's project and is again humiliated in front of her teachers and classmates. Carly Beth vows that she will definitely make Steve pay for what he did to her. She plots to go to a new store that has opened, which sells frightening costumes, and plans to scare Steve and Chuck as payback.|$|E
5|$|The Australia was not {{expected}} to arrive in Hawaii until October 31. Plans for Kalākaua's homecoming celebration in Hawaii had begun in August, and included every organized civic and labor union group, {{as well as the}} student body of every school on Oahu. The general public was {{invited to participate in the}} festivities. Honolulu was in the final stages of preparation on October 29, when the Australia flying Kalākaua's royal flag sailed past Diamond Head, making its way to Honolulu Harbor. As the alert quickly spread across Oahu, a battery of guns began firing along the waterfront from Diamond Head to the port, and <b>a</b> <b>frenzied</b> scramble began to complete the decorations. After 281 days of constant travel, Hawaii's last king was home.|$|E

5|$|Players are {{penalized for}} using certain vampiric {{abilities}} {{in front of}} witnesses; exposing their existence loses masquerade points, although additional masquerade points can be earned with quests and other actions. Violating the masquerade five times draws the ire of vampire hunters and loses the game. The player has humanity points, representing the vampire's humanity. Some actions cost humanity points; a low humanity score alters available dialog options to become more aggressive, and increases the chance of entering <b>a</b> <b>frenzied</b> state and embarking on a killing spree, when the vampire's blood is low. This frenzy can also be triggered by {{a large amount of}} damage. Like masquerade points, losing all humanity points ends the game, with the vampire becoming a mindless beast. Some areas, known as Elysium, prevent the use of Disciplines or weapons. Players can recruit a female ghoul, Heather, as a customizable servant who gives them blood, gifts, and money.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, 2013, {{a second}} European leg through 2014 was {{announced}} {{bringing the total}} number of shows to 132, thus becoming Beyoncé's longest running tour to date. Similar to the first European leg, <b>a</b> <b>frenzied</b> rush for tickets, further enhanced by the release of the singer's self-titled fifth studio album three days before ticket sales began, resulted in extra dates being added for all United Kingdom shows, Dublin, Cologne, Amsterdam and Antwerp. For the second European leg, Beyoncé had beaten the record she herself had set earlier in the year, by selling 40,000 tickets in under one hour for the two 2014 concerts at Antwerp. Pollstar ranked The Mrs. Carter Show at number 2 on its year-end chart of the top twenty grossing worldwide tours with a gross of $188.6 million from the 2013 shows. Tickets were sold with an average gross of $2,449,248 per city. In April 2014, Billboard reported that Beyoncé's 2014 European shows grossed $41.1 million and played for an audience of 384,730. This brought The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour's total gross to $229.7 million when combined with the 107 shows performed in 2013, and the total attendance to 2,082,848, averaging 15,779 attendance and $1.74 million gross per night. The tour is Beyoncé's highest grossing to date before being surpassed by The Formation World Tour which grossed over $256 million, and one of the highest grossing tours of the decade.|$|E

25|$|At the betrothal {{celebrations}} Nikiya {{performs a}} somber dance while playing her veena. She is then given {{a basket of}} flowers which she believes are from Solor, and begins <b>a</b> <b>frenzied</b> and joyous dance. Little does she know that the basket is from Gamzatti, who has concealed beneath the flowers a venomous snake. The bayadère then holds the basket too close and the serpent bites her on the neck. The High Brahmin offers Nikiya {{an antidote to the}} poison, but she chooses death rather than life without her beloved Solor.|$|E

25|$|On October 12, 2000, two Israeli army reservists, Vadim Norzhich and Yosef Avrahami were lynched in Ramallah. They {{had taken}} a wrong turn, and were set upon by a mob, enraged in {{particular}} by the Muhammad al-Durrah incident in Gaza. <b>A</b> <b>frenzied</b> crowd killed the two IDF reservists, mutilated their bodies, and dragged them through the streets. Later that afternoon, the Israeli army carried out an air strike on Ramallah, demolishing the police station. Israel later succeeded in capturing and prosecuting some {{of those involved in}} the deaths of the reservists.|$|E
25|$|In {{the dark}} attic the man finds the woman's thesis studies: terrifying {{pictures}} of witch-hunts, and a scrapbook {{in which her}} writing becomes increasingly frantic and illegible. She reveals that while writing her thesis, she {{came to believe that}} all women are inherently evil. The man is repulsed by this and reproaches her for buying into the gynocidal beliefs she had originally set out to criticize. In <b>a</b> <b>frenzied</b> moment, they have violent intercourse at the base of an ominous dead tree, where bodies are intertwined within the exposed roots. He suspects that Satan is her greatest hidden fear.|$|E
25|$|As they debouched from dress circle stairs {{into the}} lobby, they {{encountered}} {{a stream of}} other patrons on their right rushing from the parquet and wheeling toward the Washington Street exit. After Thomas Rocheford had opened the Flood's Alley exit, they collided with an opposing stream working toward that door, which was situated beneath the flight of stairs descending from the dress circle. (See Floor Plan 2). The crush developing from these cross-currents soon bought the pace on the dress circle stairs to a halt, inducing <b>a</b> <b>frenzied</b> panic when people further up pressed downward, unaware of the jam below.|$|E

60|$|The contrast. With a cold {{gathering}} apprehension at {{my heart}} I glanced around me. Why {{was it that}} of all people only Fanny could so shrink me up like this into my body? And there floated back to remembrance the vast, dazzling room, the flower-clotted table, and, in that hideous vertigo, <b>a</b> face <b>frenzied</b> with disgust and rage, a hand flung out to cast me off. But I entered her trap none the less.|$|R
25|$|Nevertheless, {{details of}} how the Pythia {{operated}} are missing as authors from the classical period (6th to 4th centuries BC) treat the process as common knowledge with no need to explain. Those who discussed the oracle in any detail are from 1st century BC to 4th century AD and give conflicting stories. One of the main stories claimed that the Pythia delivered oracles in <b>a</b> <b>frenzied</b> state induced by vapours rising from a chasm in the rock, and that she spoke gibberish which priests interpreted as the enigmatic prophecies and turned them into poetic dactylic hexameters preserved in Greek literature. This idea, however, has been challenged by scholars such as Joseph Fontenrose and Lisa Maurizio, who argue that the ancient sources uniformly represent the Pythia speaking intelligibly, and giving prophecies in her own voice. Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BC describes the Pythia speaking in dactylic hexameters.|$|E
25|$|Only 27 intrepid French {{settlers}} {{were able}} to make the final leg of the trip from the farm designated as a resting place to their new Texan utopia, a site located in today's Denton County in Texas (northwest of Dallas). The small group arrived June 2, 1848, and immediately began <b>a</b> <b>frenzied</b> effort to construct dwellings in order to stake their land claims, attempting {{at the same time to}} plow and farm the prairie. Virtually no time remained to meet the terms of the land concession. The hot summer sun began to bake the ground. Poorly fed, poorly housed, overworked and exhausted, the Icarian colonists next fell victim to an outbreaks of cholera and malaria, illnesses which killed four and sickened the rest. Making a bad situation still worse, the one medical doctor in the company broke down into a state of insanity and deserted his fellows.|$|E
500|$|A {{man named}} Vukota said these words to Bishop Danilo, {{one of the}} main {{characters}} of The Mountain Wreath, who previously uttered a piercing vision speaking as if he was alone. The second and the third verses can be compared with an idiomatic expression whose literal sense is [...] "to dash into <b>a</b> <b>frenzied</b> countenance", meaning [...] "to fall into <b>a</b> <b>frenzied</b> or crazed exaltation". Vukota compared Bishop Danilo's exaltation with that of a witch or a vjedogonja when their spirit flew out of their body. It was thought that the witches held an assembly each year on 1 March, and the vjedogonje mostly flew during the long autumn nights, especially when strong winds blew. After Vukota's words, Bishop Danilo started as if from a dream.|$|E
2500|$|Doehring {{criticized the}} November Revolution and its {{aftermath}} as a [...] "de-Christianization" [...] and thus a [...] "deadening" [...] of the political system. His daily pointed sermons were repeatedly criticized both in the democratic press and in statements of displeasure by prominent personalities. Gustav Stresemann saw in them [...] "not ... an expression of Christian charity, but ... <b>an</b> increasingly <b>frenzied</b> aversion to dissent" [...] and in 1924 Karl Barth called Doehring a [...] "miserable cream puff" [...] and a [...] "theological buffoon".|$|R
25|$|Hosokawa's {{resignation}} was abrupt {{and led to}} <b>a</b> {{number of}} <b>frenzied</b> meetings aimed at saving the coalition, which was torn between the rival camps of Ichiro Ozawa and Masayoshi Takemura.

5000|$|The Penguin Guide to Jazz states [...] "the {{leader is}} outclassed {{by his own}} band. The rhythm section is wonderfully alert and inventive with Masuhjaa's guitar an {{especially}} individual presence, and Ware is a gritty improviser" [...] In his review on AllMusic, Ron Wynn states [...] "Trumpeter Ahmed Abdullah sprays around dissonant solos and spearheads <b>an</b> often <b>frenzied</b> set that was his second release for Silkheart. The lineup was exceptional, notably the powerful tenor saxophonist David S. Ware, dynamic bassist Fred Hopkins, and underrated drummer Charles Moffet".|$|R
500|$|The Emancipation of Mimi spawns {{yet another}} career-redefining {{hit in the}} sweet, soulful [...] "Fly Like a Bird", an honest-to-God {{religious}} mantra about redemption. Set against a low-key, organ-spiced groove that recalls mid-'70s R, Carey opens with a pretty, wispy vocal and buoyant harmonies throughout the first chorus before she waves her arms, parts the clouds and wails to the heavens as a mile-high wall of gospel background vocals joins in for the crescendo. The flight of 'Bird' from humble call for deliverance into <b>a</b> <b>frenzied</b> ecclesiastic hymn is utterly spine-tingling. A joyful noise.|$|E
500|$|On 6 December 1992, the RSS and its {{affiliates}} organised a rally involving {{more than}} 100,000 VHP and BJP activists {{at the site}} of the mosque. Under circumstances that are not entirely clear, the rally developed into <b>a</b> <b>frenzied</b> attack that ended with the demolition of the mosque. Over the following weeks, waves of violence between Hindus and Muslims erupted all over the country, killing over 2,000 people. The government briefly banned the VHP, and many BJP leaders, including [...] Advani were arrested for making inflammatory speeches provoking the demolition. Several historians have said that the demolition was the product of a conspiracy by the Sangh Parivar, and not a spontaneous act.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reviews for}} [...] "Crybaby" [...] were {{generally}} positive. Danyel Smith from Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "sexy" [...] and wrote [...] "the rapper's words tumble like dice across her velvety vocals." [...] Editor from Rolling Stone, Arion Berger, also complimented [...] "Crybaby," [...] especially the way Snoop Dogg's verses blended with Carey's vocals. Berger called his rap verses [...] "fittingly careless." [...] Robert Christgau, an editor from The Village Voice, {{commented that the}} song was [...] "not real R thrush," [...] but wrote [...] "its good enough to fake it." [...] While reviewing Rainbow, Dara Cook from MTV wrote that [...] "Mariah amazes," [...] on the song also calling the collaboration [...] "Snoop Dogg enhanced." [...] Cook wrote further [...] "Perhaps culled from remnant Derek Jeter-directed rage, <b>a</b> <b>frenzied</b> and fed-up Mariah aggravates herself into a soulful, improvisational tizzy." ...|$|E

In vain Nigel tried to pull them off. They were mad with rage, these tortured starving men, their eyes fixed and glaring, their hair on end, their teeth gnashing with fury, while they tore at the howling, writhing man. Then with a rattle and clatter they pulled him across the room by his two ankles and dragged him into the fire.|$|R
