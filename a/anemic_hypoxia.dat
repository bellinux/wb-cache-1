30|$|In {{the last}} step, there were similar {{reductions}} in systemic and intestinal oxygen transports and consumptions, {{and increases in}} respiratory quotient and lactate, in ischemic and <b>anemic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> compared to sham group. ΔPCO 2 only increased in ischemic hypoxia (25 ± 10, 5 ± 6, and 5 ± 6 mm Hg, P < 0.01). Superior mesenteric artery blood flow decreased in ischemic hypoxia and increased in <b>anemic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> (138 ± 55, 524 ± 99, and 325 ± 112 mL/min, P < 0.0001), but mucosal and serosal microcirculations were more severely altered in anemic than in ischemic hypoxia.|$|E
30|$|Although {{intestinal}} serosal and mucosal microcirculations were severely compromised in <b>anemic</b> <b>hypoxia,</b> the ΔPCO 2 did not increase. The lack {{of change}} in ΔPCO 2 cannot be ascribed {{to the preservation of}} villi perfusion. These findings might be explained by blood flow redistribution toward submucosal and muscular layers.|$|E
40|$|Distribution of {{erythropoietin}} producing {{cells in}} rat kidneys during hypoxic hypoxia. We have used {{in situ hybridization}} to determine the localization and distribution of cells expressing the erythropoietin (EPO) gene in kidneys of rats exposed to reduced oxygen tensions to characterize the control of renal EPO formation during hypoxic hypoxia. Animals were subjected to severe hypoxia (7. 5 % O 2) for 4, 8 and 32 hours to assess changes related to the duration of hypoxic exposure, and additionally to 9 % and 11. 5 % O 2 for eight hours to define changes related {{to the degree of}} hypoxia. The number of cells containing EPO mRNA were counted on tissue sections and compared to tissue concentrations of EPO mRNA and to the serum hormone concentrations. In situ hybridization revealed expression of the EPO gene exclusively in peritubular cells that were predominantly located in the cortical labyrinth under all conditions tested. After four hours of severe hypoxia (7. 5 % O 2) approximately 170 -fold more cells were found to contain EPO mRNA than under normoxic conditions. The number of EPO producing cells did not change significantly between four and eight hours exposure to 7. 5 % O 2, but the amount of EPO mRNA per kidney increased approximately threefold. Further continuation of hypoxia resulted in down-regulation of renal EPO mRNA levels, which was mainly due to a {{reduction in the number of}} cells containing EPO mRNA. Comparison of graded degrees of hypoxia applied for eight hours showed an inverse exponential relationship between oxygen tension and the number of EPO producing cells. This recruitment of cells expressing the EPO gene occurred along a gradient extending from the corticomedullary border to the subcapsular tissue. In view of previous observations in anemic animals these findings indicate that the control of EPO formation under <b>anemic</b> and hypoxic <b>hypoxia</b> is similar. The cell type producing EPO appears to be identical and the number of cells expressing the EPO gene appears to be a major determinant of EPO production rate under both conditions. The observation that recruitment of EPO producing cells is reversed during prolonged continuous hypoxia seems compatible with both increases in tissue oxygenation as well as cellular adaptation to hypoxia...|$|R

30|$|Given the {{increasing}} number of publications about the Pv–aCO 2 /Ca–vO 2 and the lack of an adequate validation, further research is needed. This study was derived from a secondary subanalysis of a previous publication that sought to determine the relationship among oxygen transport, microvascular perfusion, and tissue CO 2 in ischemic and <b>anemic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> [9]. The present investigation was focused on the behavior of Pv–aCO 2 /Ca–vO 2 and its determinants, as well as its relationship with RQ, during stepwise hemorrhage and hemodilution. Since a progressive hemodilution, which does not compromise aerobic metabolism, will predictably result in increased Pv–aCO 2 [10] and decreased Ca–vO 2 [11], our hypothesis was that Pv–aCO 2 /Ca–vO 2 might be an inadequate surrogate for RQ in isovolemic anemia.|$|E
40|$|Concurrent {{synthesis}} {{of two or}} more hemoglobins occurs in normal man, the human hemoglobinopathies, and certain animal species. Duck erythrocytes produced in response to acutely induced <b>anemic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> (hemolysis or blood loss) contained reciprocally altered proportions of Hb I (α 2 I β 2 I) and Hb II (α 2 II β 2 II); the relative proportion of Hb II was 50 - 100 % increased. Relative rates of {{synthesis of}} the two hemoglobins remained proportional to their new concentrations throughout erythroid maturation. This information favors the proposal that relatively increased activity, not delayed decay, of biosynthetic processes responsible for net synthesis of Hb II had occurred. These studies support the concept that the individual biosyntheses of multiple hemoglobins, presumably under genetic control, are potentially manipulable, and they provide evidence for one mechanism leading in a reproducible fashion to alterations in net synthesis in vivo...|$|E
40|$|This study aims at {{observing and}} {{comparing}} the antigen expression of some fetal T- and B-lymphocyte subpopulations in Rh-isoimmunization, which determines <b>anemic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> in the fetus, and nonimmune fetal hydrops (NIFH) which, {{even if there}} are some etiological factors involved, causes hipoxic hypoxia in the fetus. Twelve fetuses were studied by way of 30 fetal blood samples obtained by ultrasound-guided cordocentesis between the 20 th and 36 th gestational week. Twenty-four blood samples in all where taken from the eight fetuses with Rh-isoimmunization. Six blood samples were obtained from the four fetuses with NIFH. The lymphocyte phenotypes studied by monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry were the following: CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, expression of T-lymphocyte subpopulations; BsIg, CD 19, expression of B-lymphocyte subpopulations. We observed a near-normal maturation process in fetuses with Rh isoimmunization, whereas in fetuses with NIFH we observed inhibition and/or delayed expression of T-lymphocytes. An early and increased B-lymphocyte activation marked a cooperation between the two systems in the early gestational periods...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the erythropoiesis in the dog is {{suppressed}} 3 days after bilateral nephrectomy (1). This suppression of erythropoietic func tion, observed at that time, is not related to uremic intoxication, as shown by maintenance of this function in uremic dogs with ureteral ligation (2). From these experiments, it could be assumed that the kidney of the dog elaborates an erythropoietic factor indispensable for normal daily production of red cells. However one might question about the ability of the uremic dogs with and with out kidney to response to an acute need of red cells. In preliminary notes, it has been reported that after bilateral nephrectomy erythropoiesis was no longer stim ulated by anemia (3, 4). The present study is designed to assess further the role of the kidney in the erythropoietic response to acute <b>anemic</b> <b>hypoxia,</b> after achiev ing uremia by nephrectomy and ureteral ligation, or implantation in the iliac vein. In addition, effects of sheep erythropoietin in the nephrectomised dogs are compared with the stimulating action of anemia. MATERIAL AND METHOD...|$|E

Patients and methods: Patients underwent fundus, visual field examination, and fluorescein angiography. A thrombophilic tendency investigation including prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, protein C, free protein S, and antithrombin III, polymerase chain reaction and hybridisation to allele-specific oligonucleotide probes and a bone marrow biopsy were also performed. Results: Relative recovery of visual function was noted in two patients, a 58 -year-old man and a 67 -year-old woman, whereas the vision of the third patient, a 62 -year-old man, showed only marginal improvement during the follow-up period. Two patients received vigorous blood transfusion during hospitalization, while dosage adjustment of the erythropoietin infusion was decided for the third one. Thrombophilic tendency was not identified in any patient. Discussion: Chronic anemia, as presented in myelodysplastic syndrome&rsquo;s refractory anemia subtype, probably in the presence of additional factors, such as hypotension, is likely to be complicated by optic neuropathy, possibly through a mechanism of <b>anemic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> and/or microvascular insufficiency.

40|$|International audienceHigh hypoxic, glycolytic and {{acidosis}} metabolisms characterize {{cervical cancer}} tumors {{and have been}} described {{to be involved in}} chemoradioresistance mechanisms. Based on these observations, the present study assessed four selected novel biomarkers on the prognosis of locally advanced cervical carcinoma. A total of 66 patients with stage IIB/IIIB cervical cancer were retrospectively included. The protein expression levels of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT 1), carbonic anhy-drase 9 (CAIX) and hexokinase 1 (HKII) were investigated by immunohistochemistry on tumor biopsies, hemoglobin was measured and the disease outcome was monitored. A total of 53 patients (80. 3 %) presented a complete response. For these patients, the protein expression levels of GLUT 1, CAIX and HKII were overexpressed. A significant difference was observed (P= 0. 0127) for hemoglobin levels (≤ 11 g/dl) in responsive compared with non-responsive patients. The expression of GLUT 1 is associated with a lower rate of both overall and disease-free survival, with a trend of decreased risk of 1. 1 x and 1. 5 x, respectively. Co-expression of GLUT 1 and HKII is associated with a decreased trend risk of 1. 6 x for overall survival. Patients with hemoglobin levels ≤ 11 g/dl had a 4. 3 -fold risk (P= 0. 02) in decreasing both to the rate of overall and disease-free survival. The presence of <b>anemic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> (hemoglobin ≤ 11 g/dl) and the expression of GLUT 1 and/or HKII influence treatment response and are associated with a lower overall and disease-free survival. The present results demonstrated that these biomarkers may be used as predictive markers and suggested that these metabolic pathways can be used as potential novel therapeutic targets...|$|E
40|$|Postnatal {{development}} of ingrowing cholinergic and serotonergic fiber patterns were {{studied in the}} rat hippocampus and parietal cortex employing a histochemical procedure for acetylcholinesterase as a cholinergic fiber marker, and immunocytochemistry of serotonin for serotonergic fiber staining. The rat pups were killed at postnatal days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 20. The {{development of}} cholinergic and serotonergic innervation was described and the fiber density quantified under normal conditions and after long-term prenatal <b>anemic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> induced by chronic exposure to sodium nitrite. Furthermore, a third group was studied in which the nitrite hypoxia was combined with a simultaneous treatment with the Ca 2 +-entry blocker nimodipine to test the neuroprotective potential of this drug. Quantitative measurement of fiber density from postnatal day 1 to day 20 yielded the following results: (i) both neurotransmitter systems revealed an age-dependent and an anatomically-organized developmental pattern; (ii) the serotonergic innervation of the dorsal hippocampus preceded that of cholinergic afferentation in postnatal days 1 - 3; (iii) prenatal hypoxia induced a transient delay in the innervation of parietal neocortex and dentate gyrus for both neurotransmitter systems, but left the innervation of the cornu ammonis unaffected; and (iv) the hypoxia-induced retardation of cholinergic and serotonergic fiber development was prevented by concomitant application of the Ca 2 +-antagonist nimodipine during the hypoxia. The results indicate that prenatal hypoxia evokes a temporary delay in the cholinergic and serotonergic fiber outgrowth in cortical target areas in a region-specific manner. The hypoxia-induced growth inhibition is prevented by the calcium antagonist nimodipine, which supports {{the importance of the}} intracellular Ca 2 + homeostasis of cells and growth cones in regulating axonal proliferation. ...|$|E

Characterize cellular response to hypoxia. CME Access and take the CME test online and receive 1 hour of AMA PRA category 1 credit at CME. TheOncologist. com Hypoxia is a characteristic feature of locally advanced solid tumors resulting from an imbalance between oxygen (O 2) supply and consumption. Major causative factors of tumor hypoxia are abnormal structure and function of the microvessels supplying the tumor, increased diffusion distances between the nutritive blood vessels and the tumor cells, and reduced O 2 transport capacity of the blood due {{to the presence of}} disease-or treatment-related anemia. Tumor hypoxia is a therapeutic concern since it can reduce the effectiveness of radiotherapy, some O 2 -dependent cytotoxic agents, and photodynamic therapy. Tumor hypoxia can also negatively impact therapeutic outcome by inducing changes in the proteome and genome of neoplastic cells that further survival and malignant progression by enabling the cells to overcome nutritive deprivation or to escape their hostile environment. The selection and clonal expansion of these favorably altered cells further aggravate tumor hypoxia and support a vicious circle of increasing hypoxia and malignant progression while concurrently promoting the development of more treatmentresistant disease. This pattern of malignant progression, coupled with the demonstration of a relationship between falling hemoglobin level and worsening tumor oxygenation, highlights the need for effective treatment of anemia as one approach for correcting <b>anemic</b> <b>hypoxia</b> in tumors, and in so doing, possibly improving therapeutic response.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{morphological}} {{features of the}} restructuring and osmotic stability of erythrocytes of 30 people with mental disorders and disorders of behavioural reactions caused by 5 - 7 years consumption of alcohol, the objects of the research being {{in a state of}} abstinence during the period of the investigation,. The study of quantitative composition of red blood cells and hemoglobin, as well as their ratio in people with mental and behavioural disorders developed as a result of alcohol consumption showed a {{decrease in the number of}} red blood cells and hemoglobin of 42. 2 % and 25. 1 %, respectively, indicating the presence in those people of <b>anemic</b> <b>hypoxia.</b> This is closely correlated with a decrease of osmotic resistance of red blood cells to different concentrations of sodium chloride solutions, whereby the state of erythrocyte membranes deteriorates and their resistance to hemolysis decreases. Parallel to this, is a reduction in the size of red blood cells coupled with a variety of changes in their microrelief. Conformational changes of erythrocytes are closely correlated with changes in the activity of enzymes responsible for the biotransformation of xenobiotics, primarily products of lipid peroxidation. It is shown that activity of the erythrocyte antioxidant defense system is sharply reduced as a result of increase in partially oxidized products of metabolism. It was found that the state of red blood cells is a sensitive indicator of the normal course of physiological changes, biochemical and biophysical processes in the bodies of people with mental disorders and behaviour reactions developed due to consumption of alcohol. At the same time, the measurement of the osmotic resistance of red blood cells and changes in the shape of red blood cells connected with this phenomenon is an important research method for studying mechanisms of pathological processes and the action of certain drugs or biologically active substances, expands the possibilities of establishing the depth of destruction of body tissues, and also provides excellent opportunities for researchers to identify the effectiveness of treatment and prevention for people with mental disorders and behaviour reactions caused by consumption of alcohol. This article discusses prospects of studies of the level of glutathione peroxidase activity in the erythrocytes among people with mental and behavioural disorders as a marker of highly specific homeostasis in the human body in response to long-term alcohol consumption, and considers using this index as a criterion for selecting patients for different groups of physical rehabilitation and recreation according to the level of rehabilitation potential...|$|E
