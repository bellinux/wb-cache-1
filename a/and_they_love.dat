In an interview with MTV News, Diddy explained the video, stating, [...] " [...] is really about me being {{in a relationship with}} a young lady and you're constantly loving this person, and hoping that this day comes where they change <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> you back."

The video was premiered on BET's 106 & Park on October 27, 2010.|$|E
500|$|Producer Lauren Shuler Donner {{stated in}} August 2006 that a {{continuation}} of the X-Men main film series would require a renegotiation. New cast members of [...] were signed, while the older cast members were not. Donner said, [...] "There is forty years worth of stories. I've always wanted to do 'Days of Future Past' and there are just really a lot of stories yet to be told". She later pitched the idea of a fourth installment of the X-Men franchise to director Bryan Singer, following the completion of the 2011 prequel [...] In March 2011, Donner said the film was in [...] "active development at Fox"; she said, [...] "We took the treatment to Fox <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> it...

500|$|For Filipinos, {{music and}} dancing {{is said to}} be a way of life. Natives of the Philippines are {{reported}} to have a tendency to [...] "sing and dance their way out of even the most complicated situations". Thomeczeck stated, [...] "The Filipinos love music <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> to sing and dance. Whatever they are in a natural way, they can continue that habit in prison." [...] Despite other colleagues' enthusiasm about the dancing, chief administrator Patrick Rubio of the Directorate of Operations within the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology was worried about the volume of inmates dancing, as CPDRC was undermanned. Despite inmate dancing not being prohibited by the center's Operations Manual, Rubio thought of the dance as a disaster waiting to happen. [...] "As a jail officer, I got worried when I saw it", Rubio commented. The inmates were not fond of the idea either, pelting a visiting choreographer with slippers the first time he arrived at the prison. Prisoners eventually agreed to dance, but admitted that the routines took awhile to master. [...] "It was difficult at first, but eventually we inmates got used to it", inmate Mario Benito revealed. [...] The program began as an experiment and, after six months, prison chiefs concluded that it was a successful one.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the songs}} on the album seem {{to be based on}} the {{pressures}} of fame and dealing with the resulting loss of privacy. These include [...] "Not for You", [...] "Pry, To", [...] "Corduroy", [...] "Bugs", [...] "Satan's Bed", and [...] "Immortality". Vedder said, [...] "I'm just totally vulnerable. I'm way too fucking soft for this whole business, this whole trip. I don't have any shell. There's a contradiction there, because that's probably why I can write songs that mean something to someone and express some of these things that other people can't necessarily express." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Not for You" [...] express anger at the bureaucracy of the music industry and [...] "how youth is being sold and exploited," [...] while Vedder said [...] "Corduroy" [...] is about [...] "one person's relationship with a million people." [...] In [...] "Pry, To" [...] the phrase [...] "P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me" [...] is repeated. Many think that the lyrics of [...] "Immortality" [...] may be about Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's suicide, although Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it's about [...] "the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train." [...] The lyrics that appeared in the first live version of [...] "Immortality" [...] were altered before the song was released as part of the album. Vedder said regarding [...] "Nothingman" [...] that [...] "if you love someone <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> you, don't fuck up...'cause you are left with less than nothing." [...] "Better Man" [...] is a song about an abusive relationship. Vedder wrote [...] "Better Man" [...] when he was in high school and performed it with his previous band, Bad Radio. Considered a [...] "blatantly great pop song" [...] by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from Vs. due to its accessibility.|$|E

She signed with the Octagon sports management firm. She said: [...] "It was a hard decision, but I’ve always thought about it {{in the back of my}} mind. I just wanted to try it and have no regrets, because I thought if I didn’t try to go pro, I’d always wonder. I know all the girls at Florida, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> it there so much.

2500|$|The FDA {{has been}} criticized by advocates for the {{supplement}} industry for prohibiting dietary supplement manufacturers from making research supported claims of effectiveness on the labels of their products. Manufacturers of supplements, which are considered foods for regulatory purposes, are allowed to make only limited [...] "structure/function claims" [...] and are prohibited from claiming that the supplement can prevent, cure, or mitigate a disease or condition {{regardless of whether or}} not the supplement undergoes actual testing of its safety and efficacy. Ron Paul (R-TX) opined: [...] "But the FDA and the drug companies are in bed together and they squeeze out competitions and build up their monopolies <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> government medicine because they make more money." [...] Ron Paul also introduced a bill on November 10, 2005 titled the [...] "Health Freedom Protection Act" [...] (H.R. 4282), which proposed to stop [...] "the FDA from censoring truthful claims about the curative, mitigative, or preventative effects of dietary supplements, and adopts the federal court’s suggested use of disclaimers as an alternative to censorship." ...|$|E
