40|$|Protective {{garments}} {{are normally}} worn in molten handling operations {{to provide some}} protection against molten metal splashes. These garments are also intended to provide protection against radiant heat, {{and they should be}} as heat resistant and comfortable as possible. Asbestos-based fabrics have been employed for many years, but recently some concern has been expressed over possible asbestos exposure. This program was undertaken to explore the ability of several types of fabrics to resist heat transfer during molten metal impact. A molten metal splash test, along with standard methods for determining tensile strength, flame resistance, and abrasion-flexing resistance were used to evaluate several classes of protective fabrics. The results indicate that there are materials available that offer equal or better mechanical properties and thermal protection compared to <b>aluminized</b> <b>asbestos...</b>|$|E
