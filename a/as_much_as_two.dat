5|$|Contemporary body {{piercing}} practices emphasize {{the use of}} safe {{body piercing}} materials, frequently utilizing specialized tools developed for the purpose. Body piercing is an invasive procedure with some risks, including allergic reaction, infection, excessive scarring and unanticipated physical injuries, but such precautions as sanitary piercing procedures and careful aftercare are emphasized to minimize the likelihood of encountering serious problems. The healing time required for a body piercing may vary widely according to placement, from {{as little as a}} month for some genital piercings to <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>two</b> full years for the navel.|$|E

25|$|The Third Seminole War {{broke out}} in Florida on November 20, 1855. A wide range of sources, {{including}} George W. Cullum's Biographical Register of the Officers and Graduates of the U.S. Military Academy, the unpublished memoirs of Rebecca Mullan, the American National Biography, frontier historian Dan L.

25|$|That Milburn had {{an earlier}} history on its present site is clearly signalled by the field-system {{radiating}} {{from the existing}} village. The evidence of a typical medieval layout is plain to see, with long narrow fields separated by hedges where groups of strips from the old open town fields have been brought together. This evidence is further underlined by remnants of ridge and furrow {{in many of the}} fields. However Roberts argues that village development was taking place in most cases before 1200 and in some cases <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>two</b> centuries earlier.|$|E
25|$|Many {{historians have}} since decried this decision, arguing {{the lack of}} modern arms on the Union side, {{at a time when}} the Confederates were buying them in large numbers from France and the United Kingdom, {{lengthened}} the conflict by <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>two</b> years. Others, however, counter that given the poor logistics of the Union armies at the outbreak of the war, the increased supply train needed to maintain the improved rates of fire would have bogged down the armies and made maneuver impossible (a situation which did indeed later contribute to the development of trench warfare in World War I). It is also argued that fouling due to black powder residue would have made it impossible to maintain such high rates of fire under field conditions with the rifles of the time. Individual units later purchased such weapons privately, and they were used to considerable effect, but did indeed present problems in extended firefights; these units are not known to have had any trouble maintaining their ammunition supplies. Ripley was replaced as head of the Ordnance Department on September 15, 1863 principally because of his continuing opposition to the introduction of breech loading rifles.|$|E

500|$|Males scent-mark more {{frequently}} than females, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>two</b> or three times as often. [...] Males also respond to female scent-marking by overmarking with their own scent glands, usually by combining chest and genital marking. [...] They also overmark other males, although less quickly and less often. [...] In a one-year study, males responded to 71% of the marks made by females within an average of 61seconds while only 17% of male marks received a response from other group members. [...] Because males overmark frequently, this results in [...] "totem-tree marking", where certain trees become covered by male scent and gouge marks. [...] However, no observations of widespread home-range border scent-marking have been reported. Scent-marks are usually left on trees in the core area of the home range, {{as opposed to the}} territorial boundaries.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} keep the CPRR's Sierra grade open during the winter months, {{beginning}} in 1867, 37 miles of massive wooden snow sheds and galleries were built between Blue Cañon and Truckee, covering cuts and other points where there was danger of avalanches. 2,500 men and six material trains were employed in this work, which was completed in 1869. The sheds were built with two sides and a steep peaked roof, mostly of locally cut hewn timber and round logs. Snow galleries had one side and a roof that sloped upward until it met the mountain side, thus permitting avalanches to slide over the galleries, some of which extended up the mountainside <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>two</b> hundred feet (60 m). Masonry walls such as the [...] "Chinese Walls" [...] at Donner Summit were built across canyons to prevent avalanches from striking the side of the vulnerable wooden construction. [...] A few concrete sheds (mostly at crossovers) are still in use today.|$|E
2500|$|Rhea eggs measure about [...] {{and weigh}} [...] on average; they are thus {{less than half}} the size of an ostrich egg. Their shell is greenish-yellow when fresh but soon fades to dull cream when exposed to light. The nest is a simple shallow and wide scrape in a hidden location; males will drag sticks, grass, and leaves in the area {{surrounding}} the nest so it resembles a firebreak as wide as their neck can reach. The incubation period is 29–43 days. All the eggs hatch within 36 hours of each other even though the eggs in one nest were laid perhaps <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>two</b> weeks apart. As it seems, when the first young are ready to hatch they start a call resembling a pop-bottle rocket or even fireworks, even while still inside the egg, thus the hatching time is coordinated. Greater rheas are half-grown about three months after hatching, and sexually mature by their 14th month.|$|E
2500|$|Competitive chess became {{visible in}} 1834 with the LaBourdonnais-McDonnel matches, and the 1851 London Chess tournament raised {{concerns}} about the time taken by the players to deliberate their moves. On recording time {{it was found that}} players often took hours to analyze moves, and one player took <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>two</b> hours and 20 minutes to think over a single move at the London tournament. The following years saw the development of speed chess, five-minute chess and the most popular variant, a version allowing a bank of time to each player in which to play a previously agreed number of moves, e.g. two hours for 30 moves. In the final variant, the player who made the predetermined number of moves in the agreed time received additional time budget for his next moves. Penalties for exceeding a time limit came in form of fines and forfeiture. Since fines were easy to bear for professional players, forfeiture became the only effective penalty; this added [...] "lost on time" [...] to the traditional means of losing such as checkmate and resigning.|$|E
