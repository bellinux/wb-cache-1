Ocean temperature varies with depth, but at between 30 and 100 meters there is often a marked change, called the thermocline, dividing the warmer surface water from the cold, still waters that make {{up the rest of the}} ocean. This can frustrate sonar, because a sound originating on one side of the thermocline tends to be bent, or refracted, through the thermocline. The thermocline may be present in shallower coastal waters. However, wave action will often mix the water column and eliminate the thermocline. Water pressure also affects sound propagation: higher pressure increases the sound speed, which causes the sound waves to refract away from the area of higher sound speed. The mathematical model of refraction is called Snell's law.|$|E

After introduction on the thermodynamic system of 'planetary gearing', the procedure is described for the calculation of temperature distribution in this system {{with the help of}} the 'finite element method'. The concept of <b>approximation</b> <b>equations</b> for the determination of gearing power loss in planetary gears and friction loss in planetary gear roller bearings is supported by carrying out a parameter variation, this provides the permitted bearing power loss for various gearing models when reaching temperature limits under various operating conditions.

We consider the unique global strong solution or classical solution to the 2 D Stokes <b>approximation</b> <b>equations</b> for the compressible flows together with the space-periodicity boundary condition or the no-stick boundary condition or Cauchy problem for arbitrarily large initial data. First, we prove that the density is bounded from above independent of time in all these cases.

Previous approaches which address simplification of the steady Navier-Stokes equations are discussed, and a new approach is proposed. The transverse velocity vector which corrects a given potential flow has been decomposed into potential and rotational components. It is found that the potential-velocity vector may be assumed small, whereas the rotational-velocity vector may be assumed small, whereas the rotational velocity vector and hence the composite secondary flow can be of order unity.
