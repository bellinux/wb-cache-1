5|$|Mass-produced {{pizza cheese}} {{is used by}} the foodservice industry, quick service restaurants, and other {{industries}} and businesses. The world's largest manufacturer of pizza cheese, Leprino Foods Company, processes 600,000 tonnes (590,000 long tons; 660,000 short tons, 1,322,760,000 pounds) a year. Leprino Foods holds patents for some specialized Mozzarella production processes that enable the quick manufacture of the product. One such product is <b>a</b> <b>frozen</b> shredded cheese used for pizza that is created in a few hours from milk. Other U.S. companies also mass-produce pizza cheese, which is shipped in <b>a</b> <b>frozen</b> state. As of 2000, Glanbia is the largest producer of pizza cheese in Europe. Some retail and commercially mass-produced frozen pizzas have cheese stuffed into the pizza crust.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of Brockman's report, {{everyone}} in Springfield shows their community spirit by giving them a new Christmas tree and $15,000. With the donations, Homer buys a new car. Driving it home, Homer gets stuck behind the Plow King and impatiently passes it. He unknowingly drives the car onto <b>a</b> <b>frozen</b> lake. The ice cracks, causing the car to sink and blow up.|$|E
5|$|In Canada's St. Elias Mountains, <b>a</b> <b>frozen</b> {{extraterrestrial}} body {{is discovered}} by an expedition team. Professor Arlinsky, the team's leader, sends ice core samples containing presumably alien DNA to Mulder. Scully has the samples tested and confirms the DNA's non-terrestrial origin, but is {{attacked by a}} man who steals the samples. Scully learns that her attacker is Michael Kritschgau (John Finn), a Defense Department employee. When she tracks down Kritschgau and holds him at gunpoint, he reveals that he might be killed.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, Aulie's {{father was}} using a tractor to clear snow off <b>a</b> <b>frozen</b> dugout in {{anticipation}} of an outdoor shinny game on New Year's Day. The ice could not support {{the weight of the}} tractor, and he fell through. Aulie was able to pull his father {{out of the water and}} get him to safety. The Canadian Red Cross honoured Aulie with their Rescuer Award for his act.|$|E

5|$|In January 2007, {{the company}} {{became one of}} the first {{companies}} to offer <b>a</b> <b>frozen</b> energy drink: Banzai Energy Ice, which it created with using the then popular energy drink Banzai. Though the 4-ounce product received good reviews for its citrus flavor and convenient squeeze-up container for on-the-go consumer, the product was a financial failure and was dropped.|$|E
5|$|A second method {{involves}} artificially inseminating {{an elephant}} egg cell with sperm cells from <b>a</b> <b>frozen</b> woolly mammoth carcass. The resulting offspring {{would be an}} elephant–mammoth hybrid, and the process {{would have to be}} repeated so more hybrids could be used in breeding. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing is a hindrance to this method. In one case, an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named Motty, but it died of defects at less than two weeks old.|$|E
5|$|By moving {{ice hockey}} game indoors, the smaller {{dimensions}} of the rink initiated a major change from the outdoor version of the game, limiting organized contests to a nine-man limit per team. Until that time, outdoor games had no prescribed number of players, the number being {{more or less the}} number that could fit on <b>a</b> <b>frozen</b> pond or river and often ranged in the dozens. The nine-man per side rule would last until the 1880s, when it was reduced during the Montreal Winter Carnival Hockey Tournament to seven per side.|$|E

At the age of 56, he ice skated thirty miles up <b>a</b> <b>frozen</b> river, warning two of his sons of a possible Indian attack, which occurred several days later as the Big Bottom massacre and {{marked the beginning of the}} Northwest Indian War.|$|E
5|$|During {{their journey}} together, Jaller and Takua receive {{aid from the}} Air Toa Lewa, and the Ice Toa Kopaka, the latter of whom {{temporarily}} immobilizes the Rakhshi by trapping them in <b>a</b> <b>frozen</b> lake. After this, Takua is threatened by Makuta, and abandons Jaller {{in an attempt to}} shield him. Makuta then releases three more Rakhshi, who attack the Earth village of Onu-Koro as Takua arrives. Tahu, Kopaka, Lewa and Gali arrive to help the Earth Toa Onua and the Stone Toa Pohatu: during the battle, Tahu is further corrupted and goes insane, forcing the Toa to capture him and flee. Takua decides to rejoin Jaller, while Gali and the other Toa purge the Rakhshi poison from Tahu, resulting in his reconciliation with Gali.|$|E
5|$|In Canada's St. Elias Mountains, <b>a</b> <b>frozen</b> {{extraterrestrial}} body {{is discovered}} by an expedition team. Professor Arlinsky, the team's leader, sends ice core samples containing presumably alien DNA to Fox Mulder. Both Mulder and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) eventually meet Michael Kritschgau (John Finn), a Defense Department employee who claims that everything Mulder {{thinks he knows}} about aliens is a lie. Kritschgau tells Mulder that his sister Samantha Mulder's abduction was fabricated, that all evidence of alien biology are merely scientific anomalies, and that the alien body discovered in Canada was fake. Kritschgau claims that the entire alien mythos is a hoax perpetrated by the U.S. government as a cover for the military–industrial complex. Distraught by Kritschgau's claims, Mulder loses his faith. Later, the FBI investigates Mulder's apparent suicide. Scully confirms the unseen body's identity.|$|E

5|$|In September 2015 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, {{students}} and entrepreneurs presented a fully automatic, prototype vending machine that cooks frozen potato strips by deep frying them. The final product is served with mayonnaise, ketchup or curry. The process takes around two minutes {{from start to}} finish, in which the product is served in a paper cup. The potato strips are stored in <b>a</b> <b>frozen</b> state inside the machine at −18°C, and it cooks them in oil at 180°C. The unit uses a specially-designed dispenser to prevent the potatoes from being crushed or broken. As of September 2015, only the single prototype is available, which is housed at Wageningen University. Orders are placed using a touchscreen, and a fork and salt are provided separately in a box.|$|E
5|$|John and Josephine deeply {{wish to have}} a {{child and}} when she is born with skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony, they name her Snow White. However, Josephine, Snow White's mother, dies in childbirth, leaving John alone with their child. In the winter, John struggles to find food for his daughter, Snow White, when he sheds a tear over <b>a</b> <b>frozen</b> lake and frees a {{creature}} known as the Green-Eyed One. As thanks for freeing him, Green-Eyed One offers John three wishes. For John's wishes, he asks for nourishment for his daughter, a kingdom to raise his family, and a queen for a new wife, as the creature cannot raise the dead.|$|E
5|$|Loring {{also had}} its share of {{incidents}} that did not result in fatalities over the years. On 6 March 1955, a B-36 Peacemaker crashed and burned in a snowbank at Loring. All crewmembers were able to escape unharmed. On 26 June 1958, a B-52D (55‑0102) burned on the ground at Loring and was destroyed. On 25 May 1969, a KC-135A (56–3602) broke in two after aborting takeoff. The cause was <b>a</b> <b>frozen</b> water injection surge tube. On 19 July 1970, a B-52G (58‑0208) also caught on fire and was destroyed on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Sheldon then tells Rico {{to hurry}} to his hideout, where Rico learns that {{intelligence}} asset Jade Tan has been captured in Panay's military base {{and will be}} tortured and—possibly-summarily executed. Although Rico rescues her and destroys the base, Jade is bundled into a truck and a fleet of gunmen try to escape along <b>a</b> <b>frozen</b> lake. A nuclear submarine emerges from the ice, but Rico hijacks the truck and they are airlifted to safety by Kane (Sheldon and Rico's mission handler). Jade later explains that the Roaches, Reapers, and Ular Boys are secretly backed by Russia, China, and Japan, respectively, to bring down Baby Panay, but Rico and Sheldon wonder what the small island has which is so attractive to superpowers. They track down and assassinate the foreign intelligence officers liaising with the factions.|$|E
5|$|Tim {{was born}} in Downers Grove, Illinois on December 8, 1967 to James and Kathleen Breslin. He was one of six children, having three sisters and two {{brothers}}.

He learned the game while playing with his brothers on <b>a</b> <b>frozen</b> pond near the family home and on a backyard rink his father made. As he got older Breslin played in local leagues and Driscoll Catholic High School's club team, which afforded {{him the opportunity to}} join the Dubuque Fighting Saints in the United States Hockey League.|$|E
5|$|Burnett and Loco stop by <b>a</b> <b>frozen</b> lake {{to allow}} Loco to relieve himself, but he springs a trap, {{shooting}} the ice surrounding Burnett and leaving {{him to die}} in the freezing water. Loco rides to his hideout and convinces the rest of his gang to confront Silence. Determined to take Pauline by force, Pollicut attempts to rape her as his henchman, Martin, tortures Silence by burning his right hand. Silence overpowers Martin and kills Pollicut.
