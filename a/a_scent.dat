5|$|A {{circular}} {{patch of}} {{hair on the}} central pad of their hind paws marks plantar glands that give off a distinctive odor. Since these patches become enlarged during breeding season, they are likely used to make <b>a</b> <b>scent</b> trail to allow fishers to find each other {{so that they can}} mate.|$|E
5|$|The Beagle is a {{breed of}} small hound {{that is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the much larger foxhound. The beagle is <b>a</b> <b>scent</b> hound, developed primarily for hunting hare. With {{a great sense of}} smell and superior tracking instinct, the beagle is employed as detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent but single-minded. It is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and lack of inherited health problems.|$|E
5|$|Beagles are {{intelligent}} but, as {{a result}} of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They can be difficult to recall once they have picked up <b>a</b> <b>scent,</b> and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.|$|E

5|$|Ewes {{generally}} reach {{sexual maturity}} at {{six to eight}} months of age, and rams generally at four to six (ram lambs have occasionally been known to impregnate their mothers at two months). Ewes enter into oestrus cycles about every 17 days, which last for approximately 30 hours. In addition to emitting <b>a</b> <b>scent,</b> they indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. The phenomenon of the freemartin, a female bovine that is behaviorally masculine and lacks functioning ovaries, is commonly associated with cattle, but does occur to some extent in sheep. The instance of freemartins in sheep may be increasing {{in concert with the}} rise in twinning (freemartins are the result of male-female twin combinations).|$|E
5|$|In {{at least}} some species, once a {{bumblebee}} has visited a flower, it leaves <b>a</b> <b>scent</b> mark on it. This scent mark deters bumblebees from visiting that flower until the scent degrades. This scent mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in different locations (e.g. nest, neutral, and food sites), and they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers, and {{may be able to}} identify who else has visited a flower. Bumblebees rely on this chemical bouquet more when the flower has a high handling time, that is, where it takes a longer time for the bee to find the nectar once inside the flower.|$|E
5|$|Males {{and females}} {{have been seen}} {{sleeping}} and foraging together as monogamous pairs, although polygamy and solitary behavior has also been observed. At Kirindy Forest, pairs were observed staying together for multiple seasons, though they were only seen foraging alone, with most interactions resulting from conflicts over feeding sites. Nest sharing among pairs occurs {{one out of every}} three days. During social grooming (allogrooming), the male allomarks females using <b>a</b> <b>scent</b> gland on the throat, and grooming sessions can last several minutes. While feeding, females appear to be dominant, gaining first access to food. Females are also dominant over non-resident males, indicating true female dominance, comparable to that seen in the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta).|$|E

5|$|Records {{of visits}} by pollinators exist {{for only a}} few species, but most of these suggest that the species are pollinated by insects. Flowers of A.chiribogensis produce small {{quantities}} of nectar, but lack <b>a</b> <b>scent.</b> Fruit flies (Drosophilidae), fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae, Sciaridae), midges (Cecidomyiidae, Ceratopogonidae) and micromoths (Lepidoptera) were recorded visiting these flowers, but bees and hover flies were not. Aiphanes eggersii was thought to be pollinated by bees and possibly by wind. Fruit flies (Drosophilidae), hover flies (Syrphidae), biting midges (Ceratopogonidae) and leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) were recorded visiting the flowers of A.erinacea, but bees were not. Aiphanes horrida was reportedly pollinated by wind, bees (Meliponidae), weevils (Curculionidae) and bugs (Hemiptera). Flies and weevils were observed on the flowers of A.simplex.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{follow a}} similar {{reproductive}} strategy to other herd animals. A group of ewes is generally mated {{by a single}} ram, who has either been chosen by a breeder or (in feral populations) has established dominance through physical contest with other rams. Most sheep are seasonal breeders, although some are able to breed year-round. Ewes generally reach sexual maturity at six to eight months old, and rams generally at four to six months. However, there are exceptions. For example, Finnsheep ewe lambs may reach puberty as early as 3 to 4 months, and Merino ewes sometimes reach puberty at 18 to 20 months. Ewes have estrus cycles about every 17 days, during which they emit <b>a</b> <b>scent</b> and indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. A minority of rams (8% on average) display a preference for homosexuality and {{a small number of}} the females that were accompanied by a male fetus in utero are freemartins (female animals that are behaviorally masculine and lack functioning ovaries).|$|E
25|$|Dogs have {{historically}} {{also been used}} in many cases to track fugitives and enemy troops, overlapping partly into the duties of a scout dog, but use their olfactory skill in tracking <b>a</b> <b>scent,</b> rather than warning a handler at the initial presentation of <b>a</b> <b>scent.</b>|$|E

25|$|Drag hunting, an equestrian sport which {{involves}} dragging an object {{over the ground}} to lay <b>a</b> <b>scent</b> for the hounds to follow, can also be popular, either instead of, or in addition to, live quarry hunting. Drag hunts are often considered to be faster, with followers not having to wait while the hounds pick up <b>a</b> <b>scent,</b> and often covering an area far larger than a traditional hunt, which may even necessitate a change of horses halfway through. A non-equestrian variation, hound trailing, is practised in the Lake District. Since the UK hunting ban, hunts are using a mixture of an odoriferous substance with an oil {{in order to improve}} the persistence of the scent trail, and then to lay the scent about 20minutes in advance of the hunt. Bloodhounds are also used to hunt a human runner in the sport of Hunting the Clean Boot.|$|E
25|$|This breed is gentle, and is tireless when {{following}} <b>a</b> <b>scent.</b> Because of {{its strong}} tracking instinct, {{it can be}} willful and somewhat difficult to obedience train and handle on a leash. Bloodhounds have an affectionate and even-tempered nature with humans, making excellent family pets. However, like any pet, they require supervision when around small children.|$|E
