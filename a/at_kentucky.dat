5|$|After his {{graduation}} Hayden {{moved to}} Detroit {{to work for}} Dodge but returned to Kentucky after the first summer because of homesickness. During the 1922-23 basketball season he coached <b>at</b> <b>Kentucky</b> Wesleyan College which was in Winchester at the time. In his one season <b>at</b> <b>Kentucky</b> Wesleyan he went 8-1. He then taught and coached at George Rogers Clark High School while taking {{a job in the}} insurance business in Richmond, Kentucky. In 1926 he was called to replace Ray Eklund as the head basketball coach at the University of Kentucky but was given only one week to prepare for the task with a team made up of unskilled members. The squad consisted primarily of football players, many of whom lacked the incentive to fully participate. The team finished with a 3–13 record, winning once against the University of Florida and twice against Centre College. When Harry Gamage was named the new head coach of the university's football squad, he had Hayden replaced with John Mauer. The team would not have another losing season until 1988–89 under Eddie Sutton.|$|E

Franchitti was 18 points ahead of Power, retaking the championship points lead from him with a second-place finish at the 2011 Kentucky Indy 300 two weeks prior. Power was still mathematically in the points race despite an awful finish <b>at</b> <b>Kentucky,</b> but needed to finish far ahead of Franchitti {{in order to win}} the championship title.|$|E

The center is named in honor of Harland Sanders and Brown's father. Brown divides his time between homes in Lexington, Kentucky and Fort Lauderdale, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Kentucky's {{football}} program was overshadowed by its successful basketball program during Collier's tenure. Collier was also criticized for his poor recruiting skills, a crucial factor for college coaches. Many fans wrote {{the university to}} complain about him and his staff. Still, several future star coaches served as assistants under Collier <b>at</b> <b>Kentucky,</b> including Don Shula, Chuck Knox, Howard Schnellenberger and Bill Arnsparger. Standout players under Collier included All-Americans Lou Michaels and Schnellenberger.|$|E

He stayed <b>at</b> <b>Kentucky</b> for eight years, a span during which the Wildcats football team had a 41–36–3 record, including a 5–2–1 record against arch-rival Tennessee. Notable wins included a 1954 victory at Georgia Tech, then ranked 15th in the AP Poll, and defeats of eighth-ranked Ole Miss in 1955 and 12th-ranked Tennessee in 1957. In 1954, Collier was named {{the coach of the}} year in the Southeastern Conference.|$|E
5|$|A {{professional}} football career was unlikely for Willis when {{he graduated from}} Ohio State in 1945. While the exclusion of black players was not a written rule, no African-American had played in the National Football League since 1933. The gentlemen's agreement had been in effect ever since segregationist George Preston Marshall entered the league as owner of the Boston Redskins. In his physical prime but with no real prospect of playing professionally, Willis {{took a job as}} the head football coach <b>at</b> <b>Kentucky</b> State College in the fall of 1945. Kentucky State, an historically black school, played against other small black schools near its campus in Frankfort.|$|E

After the war, Brown hired Collier as an assistant coach for the Browns, a team under formation in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). After seven years as Brown's top aide, a span over which the Cleveland team won five league championships, Collier took a job as head football coach <b>at</b> <b>Kentucky</b> in 1954. His Kentucky Wildcats teams amassed a 41–36–3 win-loss-tie record over eight seasons.|$|E

As a senior, Williams was again named to the All-SEC second-team after starting in 11 games. He was also named the team's most outstanding offensive lineman after allowing only a single sack the entire season. A knee injury caused Williams to miss two games as a senior.

5|$|By {{the time}} Farmer arrived <b>at</b> <b>Kentucky,</b> the roster had been decimated. Standout {{shooting}} guard Rex Chapman entered the 1988 NBA Draft, ending his collegiate eligibility. Sophomore Eric Manuel was held out of basketball activities pending {{the outcome of}} an investigation into his ACT scores. Signees Shawn Kemp and Sean Woods failed to qualify academically, and Chris Mills was {{under investigation by the}} NCAA for cash allegedly sent to his father by assistant coach Dwane Casey in violation of the Association's amateurism rules. A viral illness forced Farmer to miss {{about a third of the}} team's preseason practices. Once he was able to practice, Coach Eddie Sutton related that he lacked the conditioning to finish most practices. The Lexington Herald-Leaders Jerry Tipton later reported that Farmer had to leave practice half an hour early two days a week to attend his American History class.

5|$|Leading {{national}} accreditation groups {{attempted to}} disaccredit many of Kentucky's public colleges during Clements administration {{in order to}} end longstanding political interference in the higher education system. Clements worked to help these colleges maintain their accreditation and to secure re-accreditation for Morehead State Teachers College. In 1948, he weakened Kentucky's Day Law—which enforced segregation of the state's education system—by providing an exception for black medical personnel to take post-graduate courses in white public hospitals. He also supported a 1948 bill that allowed blacks to pursue medical training at the University of Louisville. His efforts to secure a similar arrangement at the University of Kentucky were not successful, despite the governor's status as ex-officio chairman of the Board of Trustees. In 1949, the federal district court in Lexington granted blacks admission to programs at the University of Kentucky if an equivalent program was not available <b>at</b> <b>Kentucky</b> State College, the state's historically black college.|$|E

Hornish finished the race in 15th place, dropping to a tie with Buddy Rice for 12th place in points. At the following race at Pikes Peak, he started in 14th place and finished fifth (his first lead-lap finish of the season). Around this time, Panther Racing and several other teams using the Chevrolet engine built by General Motors (the parent company of Chevrolet) switched to a new engine by Cosworth which was badged as a Chevrolet engine. After the change Hornish's results began improving; he started fourth and finished second, after leading for 126 of 200 laps, at Michigan International Speedway. Two races later, <b>at</b> <b>Kentucky</b> Speedway, he qualified for the pole position and led for 181 of 200 laps to win. Hornish then won two more consecutive races, at Chicagoland and at California Speedway. He won the former race by 0.01 second over Scott Dixon and Bryan Herta, the closest top-three finish in series history.
