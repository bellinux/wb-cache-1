5|$|A related process, {{flux-cored}} {{arc welding}} (FCAW), uses similar equipment but uses wire {{consisting of a}} steel electrode surrounding <b>a</b> <b>powder</b> fill material. This cored wire is {{more expensive than the}} standard solid wire and can generate fumes and/or slag, but it permits even higher welding speed and greater metal penetration.|$|E
5|$|After it is dissolved, osmium is {{separated}} from the other platinum group metals by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide. The first method {{is similar to the}} procedure used by Tennant and Wollaston. Both methods are suitable for industrial scale production. In either case, the product is reduced using hydrogen, yielding the metal as <b>a</b> <b>powder</b> or sponge that can be treated using powder metallurgy techniques.|$|E
5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>powder</b> or in {{the form}} of metal shavings, {{titanium}} metal poses a significant fire hazard and, when heated in air, an explosion hazard. Water and carbon dioxide are ineffective for extinguishing a titanium fire; Class D dry powder agents must be used instead.|$|E

5|$|Mephedrone {{is a white}} substance. It is sold most {{commonly}} as crystals or <b>a</b> <b>powder,</b> {{but also in the}} form of capsules or pills.

5|$|The German chemists Arthur Eichengrün and Theodore Becker {{invented the}} first soluble forms of {{cellulose}} acetate in 1903, which was much less flammable than cellulose nitrate.

40|$|A hard, tough, strong {{ceramic body}} is formed by hot {{pressing}} {{a mixture of}} <b>a</b> <b>powdered</b> metal and <b>a</b> <b>powdered</b> metal diboride. The metal employed is zirconium, titanium or hafnium and the diboride is the diboride of a different member of {{the same group of}} zirconium, titanium or hafnium to form a ternary composition.

5|$|As well as plant based poisons, {{there are}} others that are made {{that are based on}} animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is used to create a {{slow-acting}} poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, <b>a</b> <b>powder</b> made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.|$|E

5|$|Crushing {{can also}} be challenging. In 2013, the Philippines {{resolved}} to crush their five-ton stockpile, {{in part due to}} environmental objections to a large open fire. They first attempted to use a road roller on the tusks and then on smaller, sawn-off pieces. When that did not work, the pieces were repeatedly smashed with a backhoe bucket. What was left was taken to a crematory. When the United States held a similar event a few months later, they opted to use a large rock crusher; a short time later, France employed a pulverizer to turn its illegal ivory into <b>a</b> <b>powder</b> onto which was then poured a composite material to ensure that none of the ivory could be used.|$|E

5|$|During the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Arizona was bombed. After a bomb detonated in <b>a</b> <b>powder</b> magazine, the {{battleship}} exploded violently and sank, {{with the loss}} of 1,177officers and crewmen. Unlike many of the other ships sunk or damaged that day, Arizona was irreparably damaged by the force of the magazine explosion, though the Navy removed parts of the ship for reuse. The wreck still lies at the bottom of Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona Memorial, dedicated on 30 May 1962 to all those who died during the attack, straddles the ship's hull.|$|E
5|$|Its usual {{commercial}} form is <b>a</b> <b>powder,</b> but this element can be consolidated by pressing and sintering {{in a vacuum}} or hydrogen atmosphere. This procedure yields a compact solid having a density above 90% of {{the density of the}} metal. When annealed this metal is very ductile and can be bent, coiled, or rolled. Rhenium-molybdenum alloys are superconductive at 10 K; tungsten-rhenium alloys are also superconductive around 4–8 K, depending on the alloy. Rhenium metal superconducts at 1.697 ± 0.006 K.|$|E
