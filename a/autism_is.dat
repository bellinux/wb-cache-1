5|$|<b>Autism</b> <b>is</b> a {{disorder}} of neural development characterized by {{impaired social interaction}} and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behaviour. Typically there is particular difficulty acquiring expressive communication skills. People with autism {{have been found to}} have strong visual processing skills, making them good candidates for an AAC approach.|$|E
5|$|<b>Autism</b> <b>is</b> {{caused by}} a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example the vaccine hypotheses, which have been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the DSM V, <b>autism</b> <b>is</b> included within the autism spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met.|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} been presumed {{that there is a}} common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's {{characteristic}} triad of symptoms. However, there is increasing suspicion that <b>autism</b> <b>is</b> instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.|$|E

50|$|Many {{cases of}} <b>autism</b> <b>are</b> related to {{particular}} geographic locations, implying that {{something in the}} environment is complementing an at-risk genotype to cause autism in vulnerable individuals. These findings regarding <b>autism</b> <b>are</b> controversial, however, with many researchers believing that increasing rates in certain areas are a consequence of more accurate screening and diagnostic methods, and are not due to any sort of environmental factor.|$|R
5|$|There {{are many}} anecdotal reports, but few {{systematic}} studies, {{of aggression and}} violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, <b>autism</b> <b>is</b> associated with aggression, destruction of property, and tantrums.|$|E
5|$|<b>Autism</b> <b>is</b> a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice {{signs in the}} first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of books, {{articles}} and websites now describe AS, and prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS {{recognized as an}} important subgroup. Whether it {{should be seen as}} distinct from high-functioning <b>autism</b> <b>is</b> a fundamental issue requiring further study, and there are questions about the empirical validation of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. In 2013, DSM-5 eliminated AS as a separate diagnosis, folding it into the autism spectrum on a severity scale.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Autism</b> <b>was</b> {{found to}} occur {{more often in}} {{families}} of physicists, engineers and scientists. 12.5% of the fathers and 21.2% of the grandfathers (both paternal and maternal) of children with <b>autism</b> <b>were</b> engineers, compared to 5% of the fathers and 2.5% of the grandfathers of children with other syndromes. [...] Other studies have yielded similar results. Findings of this nature {{have led to the}} coinage of the term [...] "geek syndrome".|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} whether color perception is atypical {{in children with}} autism. In experiment 1, accuracy of color memory and search was compared for children with autism and typically developing children matched on age and non-verbal cognitive ability. Children with <b>autism</b> <b>were</b> significantly less accurate at color memory and search than controls. In experiment 2, chromatic discrimination and categorical perception of color were assessed using a target detection task. Children with <b>autism</b> <b>were</b> less accurate than controls at detecting chromatic targets when presented on chromatic backgrounds, although were equally as fast when target detection was accurate. The strength of categorical perception of color did not differ for the two groups. Implications for theories on perceptual development in <b>autism</b> <b>are</b> discussed...|$|R
5|$|The Internet {{has helped}} autistic {{individuals}} bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing {{that they find}} so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely. Sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that <b>autism</b> <b>is</b> simply another way of being.|$|E
5|$|Globally, <b>autism</b> <b>is</b> {{estimated}} to affect 24.8 million people as of 2015. As of 2010, {{the number of}} people affected is estimated at about 1–2 per 1,000 worldwide. It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls. About 1.5% of children in the United States (one in 68) are diagnosed with ASD , a 30% increase from one in 88 in 2012. The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1.1%. The number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Asperger {{syndrome}} (AS) {{as one of}} the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), {{which are}} a spectrum of psychological conditions that are characterized by abnormalities of social interaction and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as social deficits. Of the other four ASD forms, <b>autism</b> <b>is</b> the most similar to AS in signs and likely causes, but its diagnosis requires impaired communication and allows delay in cognitive development; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes; and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is diagnosed when the criteria for a more specific disorder are unmet.|$|E

40|$|<b>Autism</b> has <b>been</b> {{declared}} an urgent public health concern by the U. S. government and an epidemic by some advocacy groups. Determining autism’s diagnostic criteria, prevalence, and causes have been challenging. It {{is important to}} examine how the U. S. media {{have contributed to the}} public’s understanding of autism. Previous research found that British media coverage of the theory that vaccines cause <b>autism</b> <b>was</b> shown to contribute to the decline of vaccination rates in Britain (Lewis 2 ̆ 6 Speers, 2003). This study examined U. S. television news media coverage using an agenda-setting theory and media framing perspective. A content analysis was conducted of national television evening news broadcasts airing on ABC, CBS, and NBC from 1994, when <b>autism</b> <b>was</b> first recognized as a spectrum disorder through April 2010, the time of this study. Specifically, this study examined the saliency of autism stories and how <b>autism</b> <b>was</b> framed in terms of prevalence and causes...|$|R
5|$|<b>Autism</b> <b>is</b> a {{disorder}} that {{is associated with}} social and communicative deficits. A single cause of autism has yet to be identified, but the mu wave and mirror neuron system have been studied specifically for their role in the disorder. In a typically developing individual, the mirror neuron system responds when he or she either watches someone perform a task or performs the task him- or herself. In individuals with autism, mirror neurons become active (and consequently mu waves are suppressed) only when the individual performs the task him- or herself. This finding has led some scientists, notably V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues, to view autism as disordered understanding of other individuals' intentions and goals due to problems with the mirror neuron system. This deficiency would explain the difficulty people with autism have in communicating with and understanding others. While most studies of the mirror neuron system and mu waves in people with autism have focused on simple motor tasks, some scientists speculate that these tests can be expanded to show that problems with the mirror neuron system underlie overarching cognitive and social deficits.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{problems}} with joint attention are associated with developmental processes. Difficulties in establishing joint attention may partially account for differences in social abilities of children with developmental disorders (i.e. Autism spectrum disorders). A core deficit noted in <b>autism</b> <b>is</b> eye gaze. Autistic children have difficulty alternating their attention towards a partner and third object. This difficulty is attributed to their deficiencies in following gaze, resulting in difficulty initiating and maintaining joint attention. Deaf infants are able to engage in joint attention similar to hearing infants; however, the time spent engaged in joint attention is often reduced in deaf infants born to hearing parents. Hearing parents of deaf infants often are less likely to respond and expand on their deaf infants' initiative and communicative acts. Deaf infants of deaf parents do not show reduced time spent in joint attention. Auditory input is not critical to joint attention but similar modes of communication and understanding are vital. Furthermore, mothers who are unable to successfully establish regular joint attention with their child rate that infant lower on scales of social competence. Judgement of low social competence can be made as early as 18 months of age. In blind infants, joint attention is established by means of auditory input or feeling another person's hand on an object and may be delayed compared to sighted infants.|$|E

25|$|Autism {{rights or}} neurodiversity advocates {{believe that the}} autism {{spectrum}} is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome. This perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views: the mainstream perspective, that <b>autism</b> <b>is</b> caused by a genetic defect {{and should be addressed}} by targeting the autism gene(s), and the fringe theory that <b>autism</b> <b>is</b> caused by environmental factors like vaccines and pollution and could be cured by addressing environmental causes.|$|E

40|$|Background: This study {{presents}} two {{experiments that}} investigated whether children with <b>autism</b> <b>were</b> {{susceptible to the}} Thatcher illusion. Perception of the Thatcher illusion requires being able to compute second-order configural relations for facial stimuli. Method: In both experiments children with <b>autism</b> <b>were</b> matched for non-verbal and verbal ability {{with a group of}} children with moderate (non-specific) mental retardation (MLD) and a group of typically developing children respectively. Participants were asked to detect the ‘unusual’ face in a two-alternative-forced-choice version of the Margaret Thatcher illusion with grey-scale (Experiment 1) and monochrome ‘Mooney’ face images (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1 participants also performed a control task where buildings had been doctored {{in the same way as}} the facial stimuli. Results: Children with <b>autism</b> <b>were</b> as susceptible to the Thatcher illusion as both control groups, in terms of accuracy and reaction time to make decisions about which face was unusual. Children with autism performed more accurately than children with MLD in the buildings task. Conclusion: Children with <b>autism</b> <b>are</b> able to compute second-order configural features in faces and exhibit no difference in face processing, relative to appropriate control groups...|$|R
40|$|Information {{is lacking}} on the {{capacity}} of coaching models to alter parental self-efficacy, especially for {{parents of children with}} <b>autism.</b> This gap <b>is</b> worth investigating, considering the significant challenges this group of parents face in parent child interactions and the impact these challenges may have on parental cognitions. To address this gap, this study proposeda sensitized model of parent coaching. Results on the relative efficacies of this sensitized model to alter self-efficacy of parents of children with <b>autism</b> <b>are</b> provided and compared to a traditional model of parent coaching.

25|$|The exact {{cause of}} <b>autism</b> <b>is</b> unclear, yet some {{organizations}} advocate researching a cure. Some autism rights organizations view autism {{as a way}} of life rather than as a mental disorder and thus advocate acceptance over a search for a cure.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between Asperger's and other ASD forms is {{to some extent}} an artifact of how autism was discovered.

50|$|As {{recently}} as 1984, researchers questioned whether <b>autism</b> <b>was</b> a universal phenomenon.

Although autism has a biological basis and there are clear criteria for an autism diagnosis, its symptoms may differ cross-culturally. These differences may extend to the perception of autism in different cultures and perceptions of the most effective treatment options.|$|R
