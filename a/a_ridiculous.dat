He makes elaborate posters, prepares <b>a</b> <b>ridiculous</b> speech, and pumps himself up in the office's hallway. Unfortunately for him, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) successfully prank him by making him believe that it is a Friday instead of a Thursday. He arrives at the office very late the next day, much to Michael's annoyance.|$|E

Rejecting his advances, Zero {{examines}} {{some of the other}} exhibits (including displays on Typhoid Mary and the Tuskegee syphilis study) before finding an African green monkey, another suspected early AIDS vector. The monkey (Marla Lukofsky) angrily denounces Zero for scapegoating her just as he has been scapegoated. Zero turns to Burton and they make love.|$|E
5|$|The {{management}} of the construction was flawed from the start: the stem and sternposts, rudder frame, and propeller shaft brackets were not ordered in time, and the late discovery of this omission substantially delayed progress. Verkhovsky, having no time to place orders with reliable foreign suppliers, contracted the job to local plants already known for poor discipline and quality that were already loaded down with other Navy jobs. The industrial capacity of the Saint Petersburg area could not sustain even the modest rate of naval rearmament {{that the government was}} willing to finance. In April 1893 minor grievances evolved in a full-scale conflict between Verkhovsky and the board of the Alexandrovsky Steel Works, <b>a</b> <b>ridiculous</b> charge of 25 roubles nearly brought the work to a full stop. The savvy admiral always blamed the suppliers but did not even attempt to fix the disarray in his own office.|$|E

Borges indignantly refused, calling it <b>a</b> <b>ridiculous</b> demand. The policemen replied that he would soon face the consequences. The Justicialist Party placed Borges under 24-hour surveillance and sent policemen to sit in on his lectures; in September they ordered SADE to be permanently closed down. Like much of the Argentine opposition to Perón, SADE had become marginalized due to persecution by the State, and very few active members remained.|$|E

25|$|The sketch was {{conceived}} when SCTV {{moved to the}} CBC television network. Due to {{the difference in the}} amount of time allocated for commercials, each episode to be broadcast on that network was two minutes longer than those syndicated to the United States. The CBC network heads asked the show's producers to add specifically identifiably Canadian content for those two minutes. Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas thought that this was <b>a</b> <b>ridiculous</b> request, given that the show had been taped in Canada, with a mostly Canadian cast and crew, for two years. The request inspired them to create a parody that would incorporate every aspect of the humorous stereotype of Canadians.|$|E
25|$|The {{rapid change}} of sovereigns did Ronsard no harm. Charles IX, King of France, who succeeded his brother {{after a very}} short time, was even better {{inclined}} to him than Henry and Francis. He gave him rooms in the palace; he bestowed upon him diverse abbacies and priories; and he called him and regarded him constantly as his master in poetry. Neither was Charles IX a bad poet. This royal patronage, however, had its disagreeable side. It excited violent dislike to Ronsard {{on the part of}} the Huguenots, who wrote constant pasquinades against him, strove (by <b>a</b> <b>ridiculous</b> exaggeration of the Dionysiac festival at Arcueil, in which the friends had indulged to celebrate the success of the first French tragedy, Jodelle's Cleopatre) to represent him as a libertine and an atheist, and (which seems to have annoyed him more than anything else) set up his follower Du Bartas as his rival.|$|E

500|$|Garfield placated the pro-Grant faction by {{endorsing}} Chester A. Arthur as {{nominee for}} Vice President. Despite his {{good relations with}} Arthur in 1879, Sherman thought the choice a bad one: [...] "The nomination of Arthur is <b>a</b> <b>ridiculous</b> burlesque," [...] {{he wrote in a}} letter to a friend, [...] "and I am afraid was inspired by a desire to defeat the ticket... His nomination attaches to the ticket all the odium of machine politics, and will greatly endanger the success of Garfield." [...] He was nearly correct, as Garfield eked out a narrow victory over the Democratic nominee Winfield Scott Hancock. Sherman continued at the Treasury for the rest of Hayes's term, leaving office March 3, 1881.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers at {{the time}} of first {{publication}} met the book with undisguised scepticism and satire, but felt that Knight presented his unlikely case with ingenuity. Quentin Bell wrote in The Times Literary Supplement: [...] " [...] begins bravely and fairly by presenting the greater part of the author's case and admitting at once that 'it all sounds terribly unlikely'. It does." [...] Medical History stated: [...] "Despite the author's ingenuity the case does not stand up to careful and critical analysis and is no more 'final' than its many predecessors." [...] Since then, scholars from multiple disciplines have rejected Gorman's story as <b>a</b> <b>ridiculous</b> fantasy, and highlight many facts which contradict the version of events presented by Knight.|$|E

500|$|... "Murder" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with many}} complimenting {{the fact that}} the show was able to dabble in <b>a</b> <b>ridiculous</b> situation with over-the-top characters while, in the end, still having a point. Dan Phillips of IGN said that the episode was a [...] "major step up" [...] from the [...] "disappointing" [...] last two episodes, [...] "Koi Pond" [...] and [...] "Double Date". Phillips stated that the episode [...] "struck a nice balance between unbound silliness and grounded drama, even if the silliness dominated at times." [...] Phillips praised the way that, when Michael stood up to Jim and argued that the office members needed the game to remain sane, [...] "the character I love had returned after playing the part of moronic jerk for too much of this season." [...] Ultimately, he gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10 score, denoting a [...] "great" [...] episode.|$|E
500|$|The episode, however, was {{not without}} its critics. Tor.com {{reviewer}} Meghan Deans was more critical of the episode, writing {{that it had a}} [...] "flawed construction that diminishes what should {{have been one of the}} series' smartest and most affectionate demonstrations of self-parody". She found the way it attempted to depict Van Blundht as a sympathetic villain and play rape for laughs to be unsettling. However, she did praise the way the episode continued the comedic tradition of making fun of Mulder. Cyriaque Lamar from i09 called Eddie Van Blundht one of [...] "The 10 Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters". The reviewer, however, did amend his article, writing, [...] "Some readers are concerned that I'm hating on 'Small Potatoes,' which is not the case. That episode was definitely fun, but Eddie impregnated a woman while impersonating Mark Hamill. If that's not <b>a</b> <b>ridiculous</b> monster-of-the-week, I don't know what is." ...|$|E
500|$|Eden did {{suggest a}} counter-proposal on 1 July, {{but it was}} reduced, Bauer writes, to <b>a</b> <b>ridiculous</b> minimum.

He did not say what he would offer in return. On 11 July Prime Minister Winston Churchill {{put an end to}} the idea when he told Eden that the murder of the Jews was [...] "probably the greatest and most horrible crime ever committed," [...] and that there should be [...] "no negotiations of any kind on this subject". Of Brand's mission he wrote: [...] "The project which has been put forward through a very doubtful channel seems itself also to be of the most nondescript character.
