5|$|However, other discoveries and {{analyses}} soon followed, revealing similar-looking {{animals such as}} Anomalocaris from the Burgess Shale and Kerygmachela from Sirius Passet. Another Burgess Shale animal, Aysheaia, was considered very similar to modern Onychophora, which are regarded as close relatives of <b>arthropods.</b> Paleontologists defined a group called lobopods to include animals that {{are thought to be}} close relatives of <b>arthropods</b> but lack jointed limbs.

40|$|The long-standing {{tradition}} of classifying South Africa's biogeographical area into biomes is commonly linked to vegetation structure and climate. Because <b>arthropod</b> communities are often governed by both these factors, {{it can be}} expected that <b>arthropod</b> communities would fit the biomes. To test this hypothesis, we considered how well <b>arthropod</b> species assemblages fit South Africa's grassy biomes. <b>Arthropod</b> assemblages were sampled from six localities across the grassland and savanna biomes by means of suction sampling, {{to determine whether the}} two biomes have distinctive <b>arthropod</b> assemblages. <b>Arthropod</b> samples of these biomes clustered separately in multidimensional scaling analyses. Within biomes, <b>arthropod</b> assemblages were more distinctive for savanna localities than grassland. <b>Arthropod</b> samples of the two biomes clustered together when trophic groups were considered separately, suggesting some similarity in functional assemblages. Dissimilarity was greatest between biomes for phytophagous and predacious trophic groups, with most pronounced differentiation between biomes at sub-escarpment localities.

40|$|The Cape Floristic Region of South Africa is {{a global}} {{biodiversity}} hotspot threatened by invasive alien plants (IAPs). We assessed the effect of plant invasions, and their subsequent clearing, on riparian <b>arthropod</b> diversity. Foliage-active <b>arthropod</b> communities were collected from two native and one invasive alien tree species. Alpha- and beta- diversity of their associated <b>arthropod</b> communities were compared between near pristine, Acacia-invaded and restored sites. <b>Arthropod</b> alpha-diversity at near pristine sites was higher than at restored sites, and was lowest at invaded sites. This was true for most <b>arthropod</b> taxonomic groups associated with all native tree species and suggests a general trend towards recovery in <b>arthropod</b> alpha-diversity after IAP removal. Overall, <b>arthropod</b> species turnover among sites was significantly influenced by plant invasions with communities at near pristine sites having higher turnover than those at restored and invaded sites. This pattern was not evident {{at the level of}} individual tree species. Although <b>arthropod</b> community composition was significantly influenced by plant invasions, only a few significant differences in <b>arthropod</b> community composition could be detected between restored and near pristine sites for all tree species and <b>arthropod</b> taxonomic groups.

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} presents evidence showing that: (1) lower <b>arthropod</b> herbivory {{correlates with}} seedling survival, and (2) spider presence correlates with lower <b>arthropod</b> herbivory, seedling growth, and seedling sur-vival {{of the tropical}} rainforest tree species Dipteryx oleifera in eastern Nicaragua. The study was conducted from January 2005 to January 2006 in a 6. 37 ha permanent plot established in 2002. Seedling height, spider behavior and presence on seedlings, and percentage of leaf area lost due to <b>arthropod</b> herbivory were measured. <b>Arthropod</b> herbivory was assessed from digital photographs of each seedling within the permanent plot. Seedling fate was followed {{in order to determine}} its correlation with spider presence, initial seedling size, and <b>arthropod</b> herbivory. A GLM showed that seedling survival correlated negatively with lower levels of <b>arthropod</b> herbivory (< 20 %), while seedlings with higher levels of herbivore damage experienced mortalities close to 100 %. Results from another GLM suggests that seedling mean height (aprox. 8 cm) would be increased by approximately 1. 5 cm for each year that spiders were present on seedlings and would be decreased 0. 75 cm in height for each percent unit of <b>arthropod</b> herbivory.

While progress has advanced understanding of plant community responses to these perturbations, the consequences for energy flow to higher trophic levels in the form of secondary production are less well understood. We quantified <b>arthropod</b> biomass after manipulating soil {{nutrient availability}} and wild mammalian herbivory, using identical methods across 13 temperate grasslands. Of experimental increases in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, only treatments including nitrogen resulted in significantly increased <b>arthropod</b> biomass.

Path analysis including all sites implicated nutrient content of the primary producers as a driver of increased <b>arthropod</b> mean size, which we confirmed using 10 sites for which we had foliar nutrient data.

In a lowland tropical forest in Panama we experimentally increased litter standing crop by removing litter from five plots (L-) and adding it to five other plots (L+); we had five control plots. After 32 mo of treatments we investigated how <b>arthropod</b> abundance and diversity were related to differences in forest floor physical (mass, depth, water content) and chemical properties (pH, nutrient concentrations). Forest floor mass and total <b>arthropod</b> abundance were greater in L+ plots compared with controls. There were no treatment differences in nutrient concentrations, pH or water content of the organic horizons. Over all plots, the mass of the fermentation horizon (Oe) was greater than the litter horizon (Oi); <b>arthropod</b> diversity and biomass were also greater in the Oe horizon but nutrient concentrations tended to be higher in the Oi horizon. <b>Arthropod</b> abundance was best explained by forest floor mass, while <b>arthropod</b> diversity was best explained by phosphorus, calcium and sodium concentrations in the Oi horizon and by phosphorus concentrations in the Oe horizon. Differences in <b>arthropod</b> community composition between treatments and horizons correlated with phosphorus concentration and dry mass of the forest floor.

5|$|The natural diets {{of snakes}} in the {{widespread}} viper genus Echis are highly varied, and include <b>arthropods,</b> such as scorpions, {{as well as}} vertebrates. Various Echis species consume different quantities of <b>arthropods</b> in their diet. A study carried out in 2009 injected scorpions with the venom of various Echis species, and found a high correlation between the proportion of <b>arthropods</b> that the snakes consumed in their natural habitat, and the toxicity of their venom to scorpions. The researchers also found evidence that the evolution of venom more toxic to <b>arthropods</b> was related {{to an increase in}} the proportion of <b>arthropods</b> in the snakes' diet, and that diet and venom may have evolved by a process of coevolution. A phylogeny of the genus constructed using mitochondrial DNA showed that one instance of a change in venom composition in the species ancestral to all Echis snakes was correlated with a shift to an arthropod based diet, whereas another shift in a more recent lineage was correlated with a shift to a diet of vertebrates. Despite the higher toxicity of the venom of arthropod-consuming species, it was not found to incapacitate or kill prey any faster than that of species with fewer <b>arthropods</b> in their diet. Thus, the venom is thought to have evolved to minimize the volume required, as the production of venom carries a significant metabolic cost, thus providing a fitness benefit. This pattern is also found in other lineages. Similar results were obtained by a 2012 study which found that the venom of arthropod-consuming Echis species was more toxic to locusts than that of vertebrate-consuming species.|$|E
