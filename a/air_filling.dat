5000|$|However, this {{conclusion}} raised another {{question as to}} how Saulin {{managed to get the}} train moving again. A fail-safe mechanism on the cars locks the brakes in the on position if the valve is closed. The only way to start the train again is to re-open the valve or manually unlock each brake pad. SNCF policy requires to call for an engineer to examine the train (who would have probably found the closed valve). However, Saulin, anxious to continue the trip, enlisted the help of Boveé to work along opposite sides of the train unlocking each brake. Saulin believed the cause of the problem to be a common condition known as an [...] "air lock". When the emergency brake is activated, an [...] "air lock" [...] {{is the result of the}} compressed <b>air</b> <b>filling</b> up the brake pipes, clogging them and preventing the brakes from working. The brake pads lock as part of the fail-safe mechanism when an air lock occurs. To fix this problem, the trapped air must be bled out of the pipe to release the brakes. Nevertheless, Saulin had no idea of what he had done, and stated that the pressure gauge in his cab was marking the correct measure, which is why he thought all the braking systems were in working order. Unbeknownst to him, he had closed the main valve, isolating the front carriage from the rest of the train. Thus the gauge only showed the pressure of the first carriage's brakes.|$|E

Some propagation characteristics of proposed structure have been investigated by using the full vectorial finite element method (FEM).

It is found that sensitivity is increased for the increment pitch value, <b>air</b> <b>filling</b> ratio, core diameter, inner ring diameter as well as number of rings. At the same time confinement loss is significantly decreased. It is {{also found that the}} increment of pitch by keeping the same <b>air</b> <b>filling</b> ratio increases the sensitivity and loss.

40|$|The optical {{version of}} a crystal, namely the {{photonic}} crystal, is a periodic distribution of a dielectric structure with a period {{on the order of}} an optical wavelength. According to Maxwell's equations, under certain circumstances a photonic band gap can appear, and therefore the propagation of light with particular frequencies is completely forbidden. Photonic crystal fibres (PCF) composed of silica and air, have become very attractive for many new applications due to their special features such as large nonlinearity and adjustable dispersion and wave guidance by the photonic bandgap effect. If in such fibre the photonic band gap expands above the air line, k = beta, guiding of light in an air core can be possible. Dispersion and polarization properties of solid-core square photonic band gap fibres have been extensively studied. However, the possibility of air guiding in square lattice photonic crystals fibres, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, has not been studied. The basic square structure, a square arrangement of circular holes, presents very narrow gaps crossing the air line. Here, we study an arrangement of octagonal holes in a square pattern, see Fig. 1. This structure presents wider bandgaps than the basic square lattice since isolated high-index regions a! re con nected by very narrow veins. PBG regions extending above the air line begin to appear for <b>air</b> <b>filling</b> factors around 65 %. For low <b>air</b> <b>filling</b> factors, 70 to 80 %, the relative width of the gap crossing the air line is between 17 and 28 % while triangular structures present gaps with relative widths of less than 13 % for the same range of <b>air</b> <b>filling</b> factors.
