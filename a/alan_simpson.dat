25|$|High-profile {{during the}} 1950s and early 1960s, {{he had a}} major success with his BBC series Hancock's Half Hour, first {{broadcast}} on radio from 1954, then on television from 1956, in which he soon formed a strong professional and personal bond with comic actor Sid James. Although Hancock's decision to cease working with James, when it became known in early 1960, disappointed many at the time, his last BBC series in 1961 contains {{some of his best}} remembered work ("The Blood Donor"). After breaking with his scriptwriters Ray Galton and <b>Alan</b> <b>Simpson</b> later that year, his career declined.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{location}} of the body, the murder investigation was allocated to the RUC B Division (West Belfast), based at the Springfield Road station where CID Detective <b>Alan</b> <b>Simpson</b> served. He formed part of the CID team set up to investigate the Ogilby killing. After Sharlene was located in a children's home, she was interviewed by a female detective; she clearly remembered the events of 24 July. It was arranged for Sharlene to accompany three CID detectives in a car to Sandy Row and she was able to direct them to the disused bakery in Hunter Street. A Scenes of Crime Officer was sent to the scene to examine the building's interior and collect the evidence. Forensics later showed that the bloodstains police detectives found on the floor and on the items retrieved from inside the UDA club matched Ogilby's blood group. Documents were also found on the premises bearing William Young's name. By that time the suspects had already been rounded up and taken in for interrogation. These were the eight women who had been inside the car with Ogilby on the evening of 23 July following the fracas outside the Glengall Street bus station.|$|E
500|$|<b>Alan</b> <b>Simpson,</b> the co-writer of Hancock, enjoyed {{writing for}} Jacques, {{and thought that}} she was [...] "almost like a fella in terms of playing comedy; you didn't write for her {{thinking}} she's a woman so we've got to write the feminine point of view. That made it easier for us". Neville Phillips thought she was a [...] "complete revelation", adding [...] "although she was a large lady (very large, in fact), her movements were dainty, light and graceful, and she had a way of playing comedy that put me in mind of the great Beatrice Lillie... a subtle, sophisticated actress". Her friend Bob Monkhouse thought that her career was overshadowed by her size: [...] "She was such a great comedienne... everyone wanted her but the movers and shakers of entertainment didn't perceive her as anything other than a fat lady". Guy Pearce, writing in the Daily Express, noted that [...] "she always chose to play women in funny situations, rather than refer directly to her weight. She concentrated on the script and its interpretation instead of winning easy laughs by playing 'the fattie'." [...] The approach of writers differed in how they dealt with the characters they asked Jacques to portray. Morwenna Banks and Amanda Swift consider Jacques to have been [...] "unimaginatively cast as the 'fat person'" [...] in ITMA, while in Sykes, her weight was rarely referred to—and Jacques said that Sykes [...] "hardly ever made jokes about my size which was a refreshing change". Gray considers that [...] "although often cast in broad comedy, she never played it broadly, but with an elegance of voice and body that belied all the clichés about women and weight".|$|E

At the Hansen funeral, <b>Alan</b> <b>Simpson</b> paid tribute, accordingly: [...] "I owe him much.

2500|$|An {{episode of}} the BBC radio comedy series Hancock's Half Hour paid tribute to Osborne's play in [...] "The East Cheam Drama Festival" [...] (1958). The episode {{features}} the regular cast spoofing a number of theatrical genres, with Look Back in Anger recast as [...] "Look Back in Hunger—a new play by the Hungry Young Man, Mr.John Eastbourne". Scriptwriters <b>Alan</b> <b>Simpson</b> and Ray Galton mimic several elements of Osborne's play, from Jimmy's railing against the iniquities of modern life {{to the values of}} middle-class bourgeois life. The episode [...] "Sunday Afternoon at Home" [...] (1958) begins with a striking similarity to the opening of Osborne's play, with Hancock and Sid James sitting reading the papers and complaining there's nothing to do.|$|E
2500|$|Sykes and Milligan, {{along with}} Ray Galton, [...] <b>Alan</b> <b>Simpson,</b> Frankie Howerd and Stanley ("Scruffy") Dale, co-founded the writers' {{cooperative}} Associated London Scripts (ALS), which over time included others such as Larry Stephens. In his book Spike & Co (2006, pp.344–345), Graham McCann says [...] "the anarchic {{spirit of the}} Goon Show...would inspire, directly or indirectly and to varying extents, Monty Python's Flying Circus, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, [...] The Young Ones, Vic Reeves Big Night Out, The League of Gentlemen, Brass Eye and countless other strange and bold new comedies". Other ALS-related comedies such as Sykes and A..., Hancock's Half Hour, Steptoe and Son, Beyond Our Ken, and Round The Horne influenced their own genres of comedy.|$|E
2500|$|Working with scripts from Ray Galton and <b>Alan</b> <b>Simpson,</b> Hancock's Half Hour {{lasted for}} seven years and over a hundred episodes in its radio form, and, from 1956, ran {{concurrently}} with an equally successful BBC television series with the same name. The show starred Hancock as [...] "Anthony Aloysius St John Hancock", living in the shabby [...] "23 Railway Cuttings" [...] in East Cheam. Most episodes portrayed his everyday life as a struggling comedian with aspirations toward straight acting. Some episodes, however, changed this to show him as being a successful actor and/or comedian, or occasionally as having a different career completely, such as a struggling (and incompetent) barrister. Radio episodes were prone to more surreal storylines, {{which would have been}} impractical on television, such as Hancock buying a puppy that grows to be as tall as himself.|$|E

2500|$|On December 2, 2002, the Court {{agreed to}} hear the case. Lambda Legal coordinated the {{submission}} of sixteen amicus curiae briefs to complement their own brief. Submitting organizations included the American Bar Association, the American Psychological Society, the American Public Health Association, the Cato Institute, the Log Cabin Republicans, a group of history professors, {{and a group of}} religious denominations. An op-ed in support by former Sen. <b>Alan</b> <b>Simpson</b> appeared in The Wall Street Journal on the morning scheduled for oral argument. The attorneys for Texas did not control the amicus briefs submitted in support of their position. Two were by noteworthy scholars, Jay Alan Sekulow and Robert P. George, while the remainder represented religious and social conservatism. Several, including that of Liberty Counsel, depicted homosexuals as self-destructive, disease-prone, and promiscuous. The states of Alabama, South Carolina, and Utah advised the Court that unlike heterosexual sodomy, homosexual sodomy had [...] "severe physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual consequences".|$|E
2500|$|In a 2002 poll, BBC radio {{listeners}} voted Hancock their favourite British comedian. Commenting on this poll, Ray Galton and <b>Alan</b> <b>Simpson</b> {{observed that}} modern-day creations such as Alan Partridge and David Brent owed {{much of their}} success to mimicking dominant features of Tony Hancock's character. [...] "The thing they've all got in common is self-delusion" [...] they remarked, in a statement issued by the BBC. [...] "They all think they're more intelligent than everyone else, more cultured, that people don't recognise their true greatness – self-delusion in every sense. And there's nothing people like better than failure." [...] Mary Kalemkerian, Head of Programmes for BBC 7, commented: [...] "Classic comedians such as Tony Hancock and the Goons are obviously still firm favourites with BBC radio listeners. Age doesn't seem to matter – if it's funny, it's funny." [...] Dan Peat of the Tony Hancock Appreciation Society said of the poll: [...] "It's fantastic news. If he was alive he would have taken it one of two ways. He would probably have made some kind of dry crack, but in truth {{he would have been}} chuffed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{film has}} also been subject to parody. [...] In 2015, the Comedy Central TV series Inside Amy Schumer aired a half-hour parody of the film titled [...] "12 Angry Men Inside Amy Schumer". BBC Radio comedy Hancock's Half Hour, {{starring}} Tony Hancock and Sid James, written by Ray Galton and <b>Alan</b> <b>Simpson,</b> broadcast a half-hour parody on October 16, 1959, also known as Twelve Angry Men. The Flintstones story [...] "Disorder in the Court" [...] and The Simpsons story [...] "The Boy Who Knew Too Much" [...] similarly feature the respective patriarchs of both families playing holdout jurors. Family Guy paid tribute to the film with its Season 11 episode titled [...] "12 and a Half Angry Men". King Of The Hill acknowledged the film with their parody [...] "Nine Pretty Darn Angry Men" [...] in season 3. The American sitcom Happy Days also features a similar story when Howard Cunningham and Fonzie get picked for a jury, with Fonzie being the lone hold-out for innocence and swaying {{the rest of the}} jury in the season 5 episode [...] "Fonzie for the Defense". [...] Saturday Night Live parodied the film in 1984 in a sketch called First Draft Theater.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, he was {{involved}} in shows for the BBC and Thames Television (as well as Frankie Howerd Reveals All for Yorkshire Television in 1980). Ray Galton and <b>Alan</b> <b>Simpson</b> wrote for him from 1964 to 1966 when he worked for the BBC and also for a one-off show for Thames, Frankie Howerd meets the Bee Gees, shown on 20 August 1968. He was famous for his seemingly off-the-cuff remarks to the audience, especially in the show Up Pompeii!, which was a direct follow-up from Forum. His television work was characterised by direct addresses to camera and by his littering monologues with verbal tics such as [...] "Oooh, no missus" [...] and [...] "Titter ye not". A later sale of his scripts, however, showed that the seemingly off-the-cuff remarks had all been meticulously planned. Barry Cryer said of his technique: [...] "What he could do with a script was amazing, like all the great performers. He transformed something you'd just written – what you hoped was in a Frankie Howerd idiom – but when you heard him do it, my God, it was something else; – it was gossiping over the garden wall, the apparent waffle – he was like a tightrope walker, you thought he's going to fall off in a minute, you thought , 'Come on, Frank' , we're waiting for a laugh, and then, suddenly, Bang. He {{knew exactly what he was}} doing." [...] Another feature of his humour was to feign innocence about his obvious and [...] double entendres, while mockingly censuring the audience for finding them funny.|$|E
2500|$|That same Wednesday 24 July 1974 at 3:30 pm, {{outside the}} Social Services office in Shaftesbury Square, Ogilby and her {{daughter}} were kidnapped by 25-year-old UDA man Albert [...] "Bumper" [...] Graham, while members of Elizabeth Douglas' [...] "Heavy Squad" [...] waited at the nearby Regency Hotel lounge bar overlooking the office. They knew beforehand that Ogilby had an appointment that afternoon at the Shaftesbury Square office. Using the pretext that a UDA commander wished to speak with her, Graham was able to abduct Ogilby {{and her daughter}} Sharlene {{as they left the}} office; Ogilby, taken in by Graham's words, willingly got into his blue minibus. [...] Having made a pre-arranged signal to the watching women, Graham drove the two females away to the UDA club in Hunter Street, Sandy Row, which had been turned into a [...] "romper room". When the UDA women, led by Douglas, arrived on the scene, Ogilby tried to escape, but was grabbed and forcibly detained. After Graham sent Sharlene to a corner shop to buy sweets, Ogilby was ordered by Douglas to be dragged inside the former bakery and forced upstairs to the first floor where she was made to sit on a wooden bench, blindfolded and a hood placed over her head. By this stage, Ogilby was so intimidated and terrorised by the [...] "Heavy Squad", she no longer put up any resistance. Sunday Life newspaper suggested that she was bound to a chair instead of a bench. Ciarán Barnes, a journalist writing for the paper, had conducted an interview with Sharlene Ogilby in 2010. Retired RUC detective, <b>Alan</b> <b>Simpson,</b> who devoted a chapter to the Ann Ogilby murder in his 1999 book Murder Madness: True Crimes of The Troubles, instead affirmed that Ogilby was forced by her captors to sit on a wooden bench. Although hooded and blindfolded, her hands remained untied.|$|E
