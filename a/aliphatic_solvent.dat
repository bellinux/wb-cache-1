The study was developed into an <b>aliphatic</b> <b>solvent</b> plant situated in Colombia and owned by the state company Ecopetrol S. A.

The first step during the process was the identification of the dominant failure modes for these pump systems according to historical maintenance information collected during the last nine years and recorded in the CMMS of the company.

Additionally, a maintainability model was developed based on the current repair process capability of the work shop employed by the company.

40|$|The {{self-assembly}} of {{a series}} of hexadehydrotribenzo[12] annulene (DBA) derivatives has been scrutinized by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at the liquid-solid interface. First, the influence of core symmetry on the network structure was investigated by comparing the two-dimensional (2 D) ordering of rhombic bisDBA 1 a and triangular DBA 2 a (Figure 1). BisDBA 1 a forms a Kagome network upon physisorption from 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene (TCB) onto highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Under similar experimental conditions, DBA 2 a shows the formation of a honeycomb network. The core symmetry and location of alkyl substituents determine the network structure. The most remarkable feature of the DBA networks is the interdigitation of the nonpolar alkyl chains: they connect the pi-conjugated cores and direct their orientation. As a result, 2 D open networks with voids are formed. Second, the effect of alkyl chain length on the structure of DBA patterns was investigated. Upon increasing the length of the alkyl chains (DBAs 3 c-e) a transition from honeycomb networks to linear networks was observed in TCB, an observation attributed to stronger molecule-substrate interactions. Third, the effect of solvent on the structure of the nonpolar DBA networks was investigated in four different solvents: TCB as a polar aromatic solvent, 1 -phenyloctane as a solvent having both aromatic and aliphatic moieties, n-tetradecane as an <b>aliphatic</b> <b>solvent,</b> and octanoic acid as a polar alkylated solvent.

Using {{kerosene}} as an aromatic organic diluent in the liquid–liquid {{separation process}} for the extraction of uranium in the solvent extraction section of the AngloGold Ashanti South Uranium Plant {{near the town of}} Orkney in South Africa, incurs a multitude of safety, health and environmental problems. A possible solution may be to replace the currently used aromatic–based organic diluent with an aliphatic–based organic diluent. A range of aliphatic organic diluents were tested to determine the extraction efficiency of these alternative diluents, if they were to be applied to the process currently implemented by the AngloGold Ashanti South Uranium Plant. The aliphatic organic diluents under investigation were: Biodiesel-B– 100 Shellsol D 70 Sasol Wax SSX 150 Sasol Wax SSX 210 The aliphatic diluent yielding the highest uranium extraction efficiency, and having the most desirable physical characteristics, was Sasol Wax SSX 210. Sasol Wax SSX 210 was selected to replace kerosene as the diluent in the solvent composition to conduct the next phase of the study. The solvent’s composition was then optimised to obtain a desirable solvent make–up containing the newly chosen aliphatic diluent, third–phase inhibitor and tertiary alkyl amine. The most favourable solvent composition was found to be; 5 vol. % Alamine 336 with 2 vol. % isodecanol and 93 vol. % SSX 210. A third parameter, pH, was identified as an influencing factor on the overall efficiency of the process.

30|$|Also, it {{has been}} {{postulated}} that homogeneity of carbon suspension depends on charge distribution at the carbon/solvent interface [27] and the interaction between polarized layers is defined by hydrodynamic shear factor known as zeta (ξ)-potential [28]. This potential depends on the chemical properties of both particle surface and solution composition (i.e., pH). The pH value corresponding to ξ[*]=[*] 0  mV {{is known as the}} isoelectric point (IEP) and, when the magnitude of the zeta potential is close to the IEP or smaller than a certain threshold, the repulsive forces between particles are weak and particle agglomeration occurs. The measurement of zeta potential offers a link between experiments and theoretical background. In particular, zeta potential is often associated with the value of electrical surface potential, Etot[*]=[*]EVW[*]+[*]EElec (where). This interparticle energy depends on the sum of attractive and repulsive interactions, which are both functions of the particle distance. The London–van der Waals contribution, EVW, between two particles of the same material is always attractive, thus promoting the aggregation of suspended particles. Instead, the repulsive component, EElec, can be explained by recalling the electric double-layer formation, i.e., the chemical phenomena occurring on the particle surface in a polar host fluid. In such conditions, the nanoparticle develops a surface charge according to the particle material. For example, in colloidal suspension of functionalized carbon-based particles dispersed in water, a negative surface charge is developed on the particle’s surface by the ionization of the surface groups (e.g., −[*]COOH). Because of the surface charge, an electrostatic potential is created in the proximity of nanoparticle, and a concentrated layer of counter ions, known as Stern layer, is formed. As a result, the zeta potential at the carbon surface exceeds the total interaction potential barrier (Etot), and at given distance the particle repelling is stronger than attractive than van der Walls forces, resulting in the formation of homogeneous suspensions [29]. An interesting phenomenon occurs during sonication of the carbon nanotube suspension in <b>aliphatic</b> <b>solvent,</b> when van der Waals forces between carbon sheets are broken, resulting in a local shear at the carbon–carbon contact, allowing the solvent to penetrate within agglomerated carbon particles [30]. Further study has shown that carbon nanotubes possess small negative zeta potential in aqueous solution and it varies depending on their purification method and an extent of surface functionalization [31].|$|E

Surprisingly, asymmetrically substituted alkyl groups, which were added to increase solubility, also reduce the quantum yield and the decay time, and the effect is even larger than with bromine atoms.

40|$|International audienceCarbon-coated LiFePO 4 (C-LiFePO 4) and carbon-coated Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (C-Li 4 Ti 5 O 12) {{electrodes}} {{were studied}} for their electrochemical performance at sub-zero temperatures with two different electrolytes, conventional and low temperature electrolytes. The 18650 -size cylindrical cell using the conventional electrolyte 1 mol L- 1 LiPF 6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) + diethylene carbonate (DEC) displayed a discharge capacity of 1. 01 Ah, when cycled between 1. 0 and 2. 8 V, during low 0. 1 C charge-discharge rates at 25 °C with 98 % coulombic efficiency and retained more than 97 % of rated capacity at 8 C-rate. Same cell with LiPF 6 in EC/DEC electrolyte showed a discharge capacity of 0. 97 Ah at 10 °C during low 0. 1 C charge-discharge rates and retained more than 75 % of rated capacity at 5 C-rate. However, the cell failed at 8 C-rate due to poor ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. The 18650 -size cylindrical cell using the low temperature electrolyte 1 mol L- 1 LiPF 6 and 0. 2 mol L- 1 LiFSI in quaternary blend of <b>aliphatic</b> <b>solvents</b> such as PC + MP + EMC + 5 % FEC displayed a similar electrochemical performance at 25 °C {{as that of}} the cell with conventional electrolyte, but in contrast showed improved electrochemical performance down to - 10 °C due to improvement in ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization (HPPC) test performed on the C-LiFePO 4 //C-Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 18650 cell with low temperature electrolyte indicated the cells remain functional between 0 °C and - 10 °C. Thermal behavior of the C- LiFePO 4 //C-Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 18650 cell, investigated by Accelerating Rate Calorimeter (ARC), also confirmed that these cells are safer with both conventional and low temperature electrolytes...|$|R

The quantitative characteric {{of the process}} (the distribution coefficients, the degree of extraction, separation factors) are calculeted. The dependence of distribution ratios of monosaccharides from the amino acid content in the solution has been established.
