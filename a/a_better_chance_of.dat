5|$|As NHL {{play was}} set to resume for the 2005–06season, Näslund became an {{unrestricted}} free agent. On the open market for several days, he re-signed with the Canucks for three more years on 3 August 2005, at $6million per season. Vancouver newspaper The Province reported that two other teams had offered deals that matched the contract he signed, but Näslund ultimately chose to remain with the Canucks because he felt the club had <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> winning the Stanley Cup. At the time, Näslund said he hoped to retire as a Canuck.|$|E
5|$|As {{many more}} {{individuals}} of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, {{there is a}} frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.|$|E
5|$|Eyespots are {{a type of}} automimicry used by some lepidopterans. In butterflies, {{the spots}} are {{composed}} of concentric rings of scales of different colours. The proposed role of the eyespots is to deflect predators' attention. Their resemblance to eyes provokes the predator's instinct to attack these wing patterns. The role of filamentous tails in Lycaenidae has been suggested as confusing predators as to the real location of the head, giving them <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> escaping alive and relatively unscathed.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{results of this}} thesis show Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) has four primary impacts on the Unrestricted Line (URL) Naval officer career. First, JPME is an effective retention tool. Second, almost all URL officers completing WME do so between the 10 and 22 year points in their career. Third, a URL officer completing any form of JPME prior to the 0 - 5 promotion board does not have <b>a</b> significantly <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> promoting to 0 - 5; whereas, a URL officer completing resident JPME prior to the 0 - 6 promotion board has <b>a</b> significantly <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> promoting to 0 - 6 - except {{in the case of}} nonresident WME, intermediate level Phase 1 / 11, and the equivalents (Federal Executive Fellowships or Foreign Service Colleges). For these three forms of JPME, the effect on promotion is insignificant at all levels. Fourth, unlike JPME, a URL officer completing any form of graduate education prior to the 0 - 5 promotion board has <b>a</b> significantly <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> promoting to 0 - 5. In contrast, a URL officer completing graduate education after the 0 - 5 promotion board does not have <b>a</b> significantly <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> promoting to 0 - 6 [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

5|$|Philadelphians {{saw three}} ballot {{questions}} in the primary election, all of which involved allowing the city to borrow money. The loans, on the ballot at Clark's urging, were designed to allow the city to temporarily increase spending without raising taxes, and were opposed by many ward leaders in both parties. As a result, they went down to unexpected defeat by a 3:2 margin. Undeterred, Clark and his allies revised and relisted the loans for {{a vote in the}} general election in November, which would see better turnout and, they believed, <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> success.|$|E
5|$|The parasite/host {{relationship}} probably {{drove the}} prevalence of sexual reproduction over the more efficient asexual reproduction. It seems that when a parasite infects a host, sexual reproduction affords <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> developing resistance (through variation in the next generation), giving sexual reproduction variability for fitness not seen in the asexual reproduction, which produces another generation of the organism susceptible to infection by the same parasite. Coevolution between host and parasite may accordingly be responsible {{for much of the}} genetic diversity seen in normal populations, including blood-plasma polymorphism, protein polymorphism, and histocompatibility systems.|$|E
5|$|Tourism is {{the most}} {{significant}} contributor to Kalimpong's economy. The summer and spring seasons are the most popular with tourists, keeping many of town's residents employed directly and indirectly. The town—earlier an important trade post between India and Tibet—hopes to boost its economy after the reopening of the Nathu La (pass) in April 2006. Though this has resumed Indo–China border trades, it is expected that Kalimpong will have <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> revival as a hub for Indo–China trades if the demand of local leaders for reopening of Jelep La pass also is met.|$|E

5|$|After {{his final}} season at Michigan, Robinson {{stated that he}} was open to playing any {{position}} in the National Football League. Some suggested {{that he would have}} <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> being drafted by an NFL team if he switched to cornerback, receiver, running back or kick returner because of his quickness – 4.35 in the 40 yard dash. CBS Sports' Mike Freeman said his talents would be wasted on the defensive side of the ball. Doug Flutie (Buffalo Bills) and Dieter Brock (Los Angeles Rams) were relatively successful quarterbacks similar in stature to Robinson. Russell Wilson who currently plays starting quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks is also similar in stature to Robinson.|$|E
5|$|Males perch after {{emerging}} from their nest. They pick out an area {{close to a}} nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as to have <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> mating. They tend to perch on many different substrates such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low tree branches. Males assume an alert posture, ready for a challenge from another male, or from a predator. One study by a behavioral ecologist, John Alcock, showed that {{a large majority of}} the marked wasps returned to the same perch day after day, and two males swapped between two different sites. The species rarely perches on the ground.|$|E

Do not touch them, their blood, or their body fluids (vomit, feces, urine, sweat). Tell them to drink plenty of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) or water. Patients who drink lots of ORS early have <b>a</b> much <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> surviving. Do not touch the cup the patient drinks from. Refill it without touching. Wash your hands often while you wait for help. 2. If you have a sick loved one, an ambulance is the safest way {{to get them to}} a treatment facility. Do not use taxis or other public vehicles.

5|$|The {{peppered}} moth exists in both {{light and dark}} colours in Great Britain, but during the industrial revolution, many of the trees on which the moths rested became blackened by soot, giving the dark-coloured moths an advantage in hiding from predators. This gave dark-coloured moths <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> surviving to produce dark-coloured offspring, and in just fifty years from the first dark moth being caught, {{nearly all of the}} moths in industrial Manchester were dark. The balance was reversed by the effect of the Clean Air Act 1956, and the dark moths became rare again, demonstrating the influence of natural selection on {{peppered moth}} evolution.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{only about}} 4% of {{patients}} with photosensitive disorders are reported to {{have been diagnosed with}} solar urticaria. Internationally, the number is slightly larger at 5.3%. Solar urticaria may occur in all races but studies monitoring 135 African Americans and 110 Caucasians with photodermatoses found that 2.2% of the African Americans had SU and 8% of the Caucasians had the disease showing that Caucasians have <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> getting the disease. Globably 3.1 per 100,000 people are affected and females {{are more likely to be}} affected than males. The age ranges anywhere from 5–70 years old, but the average age is 35 and cases have been reported with children that are still in infancy. Solar urticaria accounts for less than one percent of the many documented urticaria cases. To put that into a better perspective, since its first documented case in Japan in 1916, over one hundred other instances of the disease have been reported.|$|E
5|$|Iridomyrmex {{primarily}} {{feeds on}} sweet {{foods such as}} nectar and honeydew. They hunt for insects and other ants to feed to their young, and workers are particularly attracted to seeds with elaiosomes. They collect these seeds, remove the elaiosomes, and then discard the seeds. The seedlings that sprout from these seeds benefit from proximity to the aggressive Iridomyrmex ants, giving them <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> survival. Colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds, and so the termites are regularly preyed on by Iridomyrmex; no evidence {{for any kind of}} relationship (other than a predatory one) is known. Juvenile cane toads are often preyed on, as certain Iridomyrmex species such as I. purpureus and I. ruburrus are immune to the toxins released by the cane toads. As a result, placing Iridomyrmex nests in habitats which house cane toads have been suggested as a method of controlling the cane toad population. The meat ant is the only known ant in Australia that feeds on guano.|$|E

5|$|An {{official}} inspection in October 1950 {{reported that it}} would not be difficult to improve the old road into a reasonable track, which would then have <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> attracting assistance from Main Roads. The Mandurah Road Board spent £1200 on the road, while the Harvey Road Board requested a £500 grant from Main Roads for their portion of the road. Two years later little progress had been made, and Main Roads therefore refused to fund feeder roads to connect to Old Coast Road. By May 1952, works had halted as Main Roads believed that the existing, winding route around the estuary was too prone to flooding. Settlers in the area recalled it never flooding previously, and the Mandurah Road Board was concerned that should a new road be built, they would still have to maintain the old road for access to properties. The road was inspected by the Premier, Deputy-Commissioner of Main Roads J. D. Leach, and the district engineer H. A. Smith. They indicated that a new road would likely closely follow the old road, but that a detailed survey would be needed. Nearby limestone deposits would be suitable for the road's foundation, with the cost estimated at £11 per chain.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at {{seven to eight}} years old, and males at seven to 10 years. The {{beginning}} of a female's ovulation is {{a signal to the}} males that she is ready to mate. During ovulation, the skin of the female's anogenital area swells and turns a bright red/pink. The swelling makes it difficult to move and increases the female's chance of microbial or parasitic infection. Females with more swollen anogenital areas reproduce while younger, produce more offspring per year, and those offspring have <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> surviving. These females also attract more males, {{and are more likely to}} cause aggressive fights between them. Olive baboons tend to mate promiscuously. A male forms a mating consortship with an estrous female, staying close to and copulating with her. Males guard their partner against any other male trying to mate with her. Unless a female is in a multiday consortship, she often copulates with more than one male each day. Multiple copulations are not necessary for reproduction, but may function to make the actual paternity of the female's offspring ambiguous. This lack of paternal certainty could help reduce the occurrence of infanticide. Occasionally, male olive baboons monopolize a female for her entire period of probable conception. The male protects his female from being mated by other males during consortship.|$|E
