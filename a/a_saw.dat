5|$|Building {{began in}} 1909, using oak from the estate, {{metalwork}} from local blacksmiths, and stone quarried locally, {{brought to the}} site by a private railway line. Barnsley insisted that no machines would be used, so instead of using <b>a</b> <b>saw</b> powered by steam engine, the wood was hand-sawn in <b>a</b> <b>saw</b> pit. The east wing was completed by 1915, and the Biddulphs moved into them, with the reception rooms finished around the same time. Despite {{the grandeur of the}} building, the Biddulph's lived in some small rooms and fitted the large reception rooms for community use. Biddulph also built some cottages {{at the site of the}} old manor house at Rodmarton around the same time.|$|E
5|$|Fluor Corporation's predecessor, Rudolph Fluor & Brother, {{was founded}} in 1890 by John Simon Fluor and his two {{brothers}} in Oshkosh, Wisconsin as <b>a</b> <b>saw</b> and paper mill. John Fluor acted as its president and contributed $100 in personal savings to help the business get started. The company was renamed Fluor Bros. Construction Co. in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Solar deities play a {{major role}} in many world {{religions}} and mythologies. The ancient Sumerians believed that the sun was Utu, the god of justice and twin brother of Inanna, the Queen of Heaven, who was identified as the planet Venus. Later, Utu was identified with the East Semitic god Shamash. Utu was regarded as a helper-deity, who aided those in distress, and, in iconography, he is usually portrayed with a long beard and clutching <b>a</b> <b>saw,</b> which represented his role as the dispenser of justice.|$|E

5|$|At age fifty-eight, Baldwin {{desired to}} satisfy his nature {{of being a}} pioneer again by moving to Kansas, which {{was at that time}} a territory. He arrived as the brunt of the {{fighting}} in the territory was ending. Upon his arrival, he founded Baldwin City and built the first college building in the territory, which became the foundation for Baker University. He was in Kansas only for a short time when tragedy struck. On August 30, 1858, John's son Milton died unexpectedly after having been sick for only three days. Within a couple years, he laid out a town, built a grist mill and <b>a</b> <b>saw</b> mill, and he turned over the town and college to the Methodist Conference and returned to Berea, although he continued to finance it.|$|E
5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} similar to <b>a</b> <b>saw,</b> except {{the height of}} the teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E
5|$|By September, Brooks {{was back}} at a work camp, this time in Svitavy in the Sudetenland. He escaped that month with five other men, this time making it to Lüneburg inside a coal train prior to his recapture. Sent to a {{prisoner}} of war camp near Wiener Neustadt, he once more tried to escape but failed, suffered a severe beating {{at the hands of the}} Germans, and was again sent back to Stalag VIII-B for two weeks of solitary confinement. Working as a truck helper from <b>a</b> <b>saw</b> mill in Toszek, he slowly acquired maps of Europe and the surrounding region as well as contact information for the Polish Underground State. Having escaped twice already, he risked transfer to a special punishment camp if caught again but, nevertheless, he fled his detention once more, this time with a Scottish soldier by the name of John Duncan, in May 1943.|$|E

5|$|Classic {{examples}} are {{found at the}} Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just {{to the north of}} the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the teeth on <b>a</b> <b>saw</b> blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.|$|E
25|$|Described in 1836 as Sweetman's Flour Mills, it {{frequently}} {{changed hands}} before closing down in 1887. It was later operated as <b>a</b> <b>saw</b> mill. The dry mill race {{can still be}} seen here {{on the north side}} of Butterfield Avenue.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, {{travelers}} of the horse-and-buggy era used an unscheduled ferry to cross from Fidalgo Island to Whidbey Island. To call the ferry, they banged <b>a</b> <b>saw</b> with a mallet and then sat back to wait.|$|E
