25|$|These {{are used}} for {{high-temperature}} Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (nearly 340nbsp&°C) to produce low-molecular-weight unsaturated hydrocarbons on <b>alkalized</b> fused iron catalysts. The fluid-bed technology (as adapted from the catalytic cracking of heavy petroleum distillates) was introduced by Hydrocarbon Research in 1946–50 and named the ‘Hydrocol’ process. A large scale Fischer–Tropsch Hydrocol plant (350,000 tons per annum) operated during 1951–57 in Brownsville, Texas. Due to technical problems, and lacking economy due to increasing petroleum availability, this development was discontinued. Fluid-bed Fischer–Tropsch synthesis has recently been very successfully reinvestigated by Sasol. One reactor with a capacity of 500,000 tons per annum is now in operation and even larger ones are being built (nearly 850,000 tons per annum). The process is now used mainly for C2 and C7 alkene production. This new development {{can be regarded as}} an important progress in Fischer–Tropsch technology. A high-temperature process with a circulating iron catalyst (‘circulating fluid bed’, ‘riser reactor’, ‘entrained catalyst process’) was introduced by the Kellogg Company and a respective plant built at Sasol in 1956. It was improved by Sasol for successful operation. At Secunda, South Africa, Sasol operated 16 advanced reactors of this type with a capacity of approximately 330,000 tons per annum each. Now the circulating catalyst process is being replaced by the superior Sasol-advanced fluid-bed technology. Early experiments with cobalt catalyst particles suspended in oil have been performed by Fischer. The bubble column reactor with a powdered iron slurry catalyst and a CO-rich syngas was particularly developed to pilot plant scale by Kölbel at the Rheinpreuben Company in 1953. Recently (since 1990) low-temperature Fischer–Tropsch slurry processes are under investigation for the use of iron and cobalt catalysts, particularly for the production of a hydrocarbon wax, or to be hydrocracked and isomerised to produce diesel fuel, by Exxon and Sasol. Today slurry-phase (bubble column) low-temperature Fischer–Tropsch synthesis is regarded by many authors as the most efficient process for Fischer–Tropsch clean diesel production. This Fischer–Tropsch technology is also under development by the Statoil Company (Norway) for use on a vessel to convert associated gas at offshore oil fields into a hydrocarbon liquid.|$|E

40|$|Numerous loss-of-function {{mutations}} in the progranulin (GRN) gene cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin and TAR-DNA binding protein 43 -positive inclusions by reduced production and secretion of GRN. Consistent with {{the observation that}} GRN has neurotrophic properties, pharmacological stimulation of GRN production is a promising approach to rescue GRNhaploinsufficiency and prevent disease progression. We therefore searched for compounds capable of selectively increasing GRN levels. Here, we demonstrate that four independent and highly selective inhibitors of vacuolar ATPase (bafilomycin A 1, concanamycin A, archazolid B, and apicularen A) significantly elevate intracellular and secreted GRN. Furthermore, clinically used <b>alkalizing</b> drugs, including chloroquine, bepridil, and amiodarone, similarly stimulate GRN production.

Repaglinide compositions containing different types and levels of excipients and different drug potencies (50 %– 86 %) were produced by the URF technology. Repaglinide/excipient solutions were frozen on a cryogenic substrate, collected, and lyophilized to form a dry powder. Surfactants, including sodium dodecyl sulfate, and <b>alkalizing</b> agents such as diethanolamine (DEA) and tromethamine (TRIS) were incorporated into the compositions. Forced degradation of repaglinide was conducted under stressed conditions (eg, elevated temperature, exposure to peroxide) to determine the stability of the drug in such environments.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction & Objective: Endotracheal {{intubation}} during {{general anesthesia}} {{is necessary to}} control the ventilation of patients during surgery. Nevertheless, the endotracheal tube as an external object can stimulate the patient’s airway during the emergence from general anesthesia and create different reactions and complications. To prevent these reactions, {{a wide variety of}} interventions have been examined. In this study, post-extubation endotracheal tube complications are investigated in 3 different states of lidocaine 4 % for filling endotracheal tube cuffs. Materials & Methods: In this quasi-experimental clinical trial study executed in one of Shiraz hospitals during 2005 - 2006, 200 candidates of elective surgery being in class 1 and 2 ASA were randomly divided into 4 groups (N= 50). The endotracheal tube cuffs of each group members were filled with (5 - 10 ml) distilled water, lidocaine 4 %, <b>alkalized</b> lidocaine 4 % and warmed <b>alkalized</b> lidocaine 4 %, respectively. The patients were observed for complications such as cough (for 6 hrs), sore throat, hoarseness (for 24 hrs) and laryngospasm (immediately) after extubation. The data were analyzed by chi square and logistic regression using SPSS. Results: The findings revealed that the frequency of cough, sore throat and hoarseness was more in the control (distilled water) group as compared to the 2 groups of the study (<b>alkalized</b> lidocaine 4 % and warmed <b>alkalized</b> lidocaine 4 %). Distilled water and lidocaine 4 % groups differed significantly in only the frequency of sore throat. The odds ratio of cough, sore throat and hoarseness was just significant for the distilled water group in comparison to warmed <b>alkalized</b> lidocaine 4 %. Furthermore the odds ratio of the above-mentioned complications was significant for the distilled water and lidocaine 4 % groups in comparison to the warmed <b>alkalized</b> lidocaine 4 % group.

Conclusion: Filling endotracheal tube cuffs with <b>alkalized</b> lidocaine 4 % and warmed <b>alkalized</b> lidocaine 4 % decreases the frequency of the post-extubation complications (cough, sore throat and hoarseness).

We conducted laboratory experiments with anoxic slurries of acid Acrisols from Indonesia and Zambia and two contrasting BCs produced locally from rice husk and cacao shell. Dose-dependent responses of denitrification and gaseous products (NO, N 2 O and N 2) were assessed by high-resolution gas kinetics and related to the <b>alkalizing</b> effect of the BCs. To delineate the pH effect from other BC effects, we removed part of the alkalinity by leaching the BCs with water and acid prior to incubation. Uncharred cacao shell and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were also included in the study. The untreated BCs suppressed N 2 O and NO and increased N 2 production during denitrification, irrespective of the effect on denitrification rate. The extent of N 2 O and NO suppression was dose-dependent and increased with the <b>alkalizing</b> effect of the two BC types, which was strongest for cacao shell BC. Acid leaching of BC, which decreased its <b>alkalizing</b> effect, reduced or eliminated the ability of BC to suppress N 2 O and NO net production. Just like untreated BCs, NaOH reduced net production of N 2 O and NO while increasing that of N 2. This confirms the importance of altered soil pH for denitrification product stoichiometry. Addition of uncharred cacao shell stimulated denitrification strongly due to availability of labile carbon but only minor effects on the product stoichiometry of denitrification were found, in accordance with its modest effect on soil pH.
