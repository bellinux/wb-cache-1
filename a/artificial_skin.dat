25|$|The Question's mask is {{made from}} Pseudoderm, a {{substance}} made by Doctor Aristotle Rodor. According to the revamps of 52, this substance was developed using technology lifted from an old Batman foe named Bart Magan (Dr. No Face) and Gingold Extract, a fruit derivative associated with the Elongated Man. The Question's series by Denny O'Neil presented Pseudoderm as Rodor's attempt to create an <b>artificial</b> <b>skin</b> for humanitarian purposes. The Question is able to see out clearly through his mask. In early appearances, the mask was described as containing air filters.|$|E

50|$|Lifelike {{mechanical}} arms, {{along with}} ordinary human arms, are so similar {{that it may}} be hard to distinguish between the two. The reason for this is because a spray, that places a coat on the prosthetic arm, makes the arm look real. This futuristic fantasy is beginning to become more of a reality. Scientists are even starting to create sleeve type <b>artificial</b> <b>skins</b> to keep a prosthetic arm looking like a normal arm. This will allow people with prosthetics to not feel self-conscious of their robotic arm.|$|R

25|$|Sage was {{approached}} by Aristotle Rodor, his former professor, currently a scientist. Rodor told Sage about an <b>artificial</b> <b>skin</b> he had co-developed with Dr. Twain called Pseudoderm. Pseudoderm was intended to work as an applied skin-like bandage {{with the help of}} a bonding gas, but it had an unforeseen toxicity which was sometimes fatal when applied to open wounds. Rodor and Twain agreed to abandon the project and parted ways, but Professor Rodor discovered that Dr. Twain had decided to proceed with an illegal sale of the invention to Third World nations, regardless of the risk to human health.|$|E
25|$|Current robotic and {{prosthetic}} hands receive {{far less}} tactile information than the human hand. Recent research {{has developed a}} tactile sensor array that mimics the mechanical properties and touch receptors of human fingertips. The sensor array is constructed as a rigid core surrounded by conductive fluid contained by an elastomeric skin. Electrodes are mounted {{on the surface of}} the rigid core and are connected to an impedance-measuring device within the core. When the <b>artificial</b> <b>skin</b> touches an object the fluid path around the electrodes is deformed, producing impedance changes that map the forces received from the object. The researchers expect that an important function of such artificial fingertips will be adjusting robotic grip on held objects.|$|E
2500|$|One way to {{increase}} growth factor concentrations in wounds is to apply the growth factors directly. This generally takes many repetitions and requires large amounts of the factors, although biomaterials are being developed that control the delivery of growth factors over time. [...] Another way is to spread onto the wound a gel of the patient’s own blood platelets, which then secrete growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor 1–2 (IGF), PDGF, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and epidermal growth factor (EGF). [...] Other treatments include implanting cultured keratinocytes into the wound to reepithelialize it and culturing and implanting fibroblasts into wounds. [...] Some patients are treated with <b>artificial</b> <b>skin</b> substitutes that have fibroblasts and keratinocytes in a matrix of collagen to replicate skin and release growth factors.|$|E

The result is a touchless human-machine interface, including piezo- and pyroelectric sensor pixels (sensitive to pressure changes and impinging infrared light), transistors for impedance matching and signal conditioning, and an electrochromic display. Applications may not only emerge in human-machine interfaces, but also in transient temperature or pressure sensing used in safety technology, in <b>artificial</b> <b>skins</b> and in disposable sensor labels...|$|R
40|$|The {{idea of an}} <b>Artificial</b> Sensate <b>Skin</b> {{device that}} mimics the {{characteristics}} and functions of its analogous living tissue whether human or animal is not new. Yet, most of the current related work has been focused {{in the development of}} either materials, flexible electronics or ultra-dense sensing matrices and Wide Area Sensor Networks. The current work describes the design and implementation of a new type of <b>Artificial</b> Sensate <b>Skin.</b> This <b>Artificial</b> Sensate <b>Skin</b> is implemented as a low-power, highly scalable and mechanically flexible Wired Sensor Network. This Skin is composed of one or many Skin Patches which in turn are composed of one or many Skin Nodes. Each node is able to measure Strain, Pressure, Ambient Light, Pressure, Sound and Mechanoreception. Each Skin Patch can either work as a stand-alone device or as a data extraction device if this is attached to a Personal Computer through a different type of device referred to as Brains. Each Skin Node and therefore each Skin Patch is Dynamically Adaptable meaning that they can adapt to external stimuli by either modifying their behavior or by completely changing their code.

40|$|Octopus skin {{samples were}} tested under {{quasi-static}} and scissor cutting conditions {{to measure the}} in-plane material properties and fracture toughness. Samples from all eight arms of one octopus were tested statically to investigate how properties vary from arm to arm. Another nine octopus skins were measured to study the influence of body mass on skin properties. Influence of specimen location on skin mechanical properties was also studied. Material properties of skin, i. e. the Young's modulus, ultimate stress, failure strain and fracture toughness have been plotted against the position of skin {{along the length of}} arm or body. Statistical studies were carried out to help analyzing experimental data obtained. Results of this work will be used as guidelines for the design and development of <b>artificial</b> <b>skins</b> for an octopus-inspired robot. ...|$|R
2500|$|Data is {{vulnerable}} to technological hazards such as computer viruses, certain levels of energy discharges, ship malfunctions (when connected to the Enterprise main computer for experiments), and shutdowns whether through remote control shutdown devices or through use of his [...] "off switch", located on his lower back near where a human kidney would be. Besides Data, very few members of the Enterprise crew are aware of this switch's existence for reasons of security, including Captain Picard, Commander Riker and Chief Engineer LaForge. Dr. Crusher, who is bound by her Hippocratic Oath forbidding her from divulging this to anyone without Data's express permission, was {{the first member of}} the crew to be made aware of its existence in the first season episode [...] "". Data has also been [...] "possessed" [...] through technological means such as: Ira Graves's transfer of consciousness into his neural net; Dr. Soong's [...] "calling" [...] him; and an alien library that placed several different personalities into him. Data cannot swim unless aided by his built in flotation device, yet he can perform tasks underwater without the need to surface. Data is also impervious to sensory tactile emotion such as pain or pleasure. In [...] the Borg Queen grafted <b>artificial</b> <b>skin</b> to his forearm. Data was then able to feel pain when a Borg drone slashed at his arm, and pleasure when the Borg Queen blew on the skin's hair follicles. Despite being mechanical in nature, Data is treated as an equal member of the Enterprise crew in every regard. Being a mechanical construct, technicians such as Chief Engineer LaForge prove to be more appropriate to treat his mechanical or cognitive function failures than the ship's doctor. His positronic brain becomes deactivated, repaired, and reactivated by Geordi on several occasions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPain during {{injection}} {{of a medical}} needle is greatly influenced by the surface roughness and geometry of its cutting edges. An ion- plasma sputtering treatment is a promising candidate as a clean and precise polishing method for the painless needles. In this paper, the mechanism of the reduction of inserting force of the plasma-treated needles is investigated by microscopically observing <b>artificial</b> <b>skins</b> and needles during insertion. It {{was found that the}} time distribution of insertion force was influenced by the roughness at the cutting edges. Plasma-treated needles resulted in force reduction by approximate half in comparison of untreated ones. Furthermore, the microscopic observation found that the sharp dropping of force was occurring at the corners between cutting faces. Using the plasma-treated needle, the sharp dropping was significantly decreased. The plasma-etching treatment will lead to a clean finishing process for painless medical needles...|$|R
40|$|The {{artificial}} {{hands for}} sociable robotics and prosthetics {{are expected to}} be touched by other people. Because the skin is the main interface during the contact, a need arises to duplicate humanlike characteristics for <b>artificial</b> <b>skins</b> for safety and social acceptance. Towards the goal of replicating humanlike social touch, this paper compares the skin compliance, conformance and hysteresis of typical robotic and prosthetic skin materials, such as silicone and polyurethane, with the published biomechanical behaviour of the human fingertip. The objective was achieved through materials characterization, finite element (FE) modeling and validation experiments. Our initial attempt showed that the selected types of silicone and polyurethane materials did not exhibit the same qualities as the human fingertip skin. However, the methodologies described herein can be used to evaluate other materials, their possible combinations or other fingertip design configuration...|$|R
40|$|Human {{skin and}} hair can {{simultaneously}} feel pressure, temperature, humidity, strain, and flow—great inspirations for applications such as <b>artificial</b> <b>skins</b> for burn and acid victims, robotics, and vehicular technology. Previous efforts in this direction use sophisticated materials or processes. Chemically functionalized, inkjet printed or vacuum-technology-processed papers albeit cheap have shown limited functionalities. Thus, performance and/or functionalities per cost have been limited. Here, a scalable “garage” fabrication approach is shown using off-the-shelf inexpensive household elements such as aluminum foil, scotch tapes, sticky-notes, napkins, and sponges to build “paper skin” with simultaneous real-time sensing capability of pressure, temperature, humidity, proximity, pH, and flow. Enabling {{the basic principles of}} porosity, adsorption, and dimensions of these materials, a fully functioning distributed sensor network platform is reported, which, for the first time, can sense the vitals of its carrier (body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and skin hydration) and the surrounding environment...|$|R

40|$|Stretchable and {{curvilinear}} electronics {{has been}} used recently for the fabrication of micro systems interacting with the human body. The applications range from different kinds of implantable sensors inside the body to conformable electrodes and <b>artificial</b> <b>skins.</b> One of the key parameters in biocompatible stretchable electronics is the fabrication of reliable electrical interconnects. Although very recent literature has reported on the reliability of stretchable interconnects by cyclic loading, work {{still needs to be}} done on the integration of electrical circuitry composed of rigid components and stretchable interconnects in a biological environment. In this work, the feasibility of a developed technology to fabricate simple electrical circuits with meander shaped stretchable interconnects is presented. Stretchable interconnects are 200 nm thin Au layer supported with polyimide (PI).

40|$|Self-shaping of curved structures, {{especially}} those involving flexible thin layers, has attracted increasing attention {{because of their}} broad potential applications in e. g. nanoelectromechanical/micro-electromechanical systems (NEMS/MEMS), sensors, <b>artificial</b> <b>skins,</b> stretchable electronics, robotics, and drug delivery. Here, we {{provide an overview of}} recent experimental, theoretical, and computational studies on the mechanical self-assembly of strain-engineered thin layers, with an emphasis on systems in which the competition between bending and stretchingenergy gives rise to a variety ofdeformations,such as wrinkling, rolling, and twisting. We address the principle of mechanical instabilities, which is often manifested in wrinkling or multistability of strain-engineered thin layers. The principles of shape selection and transition in helical ribbons are also systematically examined. We hope that a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanical principles underlying these rich phenomena can foster the development of new techniques for manufacturing functional three- dimensional structures on demand for a broad spectrum of engineering applications.

50|$|Hanna Wendt, {{and a team}} of {{her colleagues}} in the Department of Plastic, Hand and Reconstructive Surgery at Medical School Hannover Germany, have found a method for {{creating}} <b>artificial</b> <b>skin</b> using spider silk. Before this, however, <b>artificial</b> <b>skin</b> was grown using materials like collagen. These materials did not seem strong enough. Instead, Wendt and her team turned to spider silk, which is known to be 5 times stronger than Kevlar. The silk is harvested by “milking” the silk glands of golden orb web spiders. The silk was spooled as it was harvested, and then it was woven into a rectangular steel frame. The steel frame was 0.7 mm thick and the resulting weave was easy-to-handle, as well as easy to sterilize. Human skin cells were added to the meshwork silk and were found to flourish under an environment providing nutrients, warmth and air. However at this time, using spider silk to grow <b>artificial</b> <b>skin</b> in mass quantities is not practical because of the tedious process of harvesting spider silk.|$|E

40|$|In human-computer {{interaction}} studies, an interaction is often {{considered as a}} kind of information or discrete internal states of an individual that can be transmitted in a loss-free manner from people to computing interfaces (or robotic interfaces) and vice-versa [5, 17].
