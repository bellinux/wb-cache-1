[...] Baker suggested that the character should be portrayed as a young child, which McCracken agreed because it brought originality to the story, and allowed him to [...] "be more emotional, to not understand the bigger picture, to be confused and vulnerable and like <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> <b>to</b> throw a fit when they don't get their way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Idle {{was born}} in Harton Hospital, in South Shields in County Durham, to which {{his mother had been}} {{evacuated}} from the north west of England. His mother, Norah Barron (Sanderson), was a health visitor and his father, Ernest Idle, served in the Royal Air Force during World War II, only to be killed in a hitch-hiking accident shortly after the war. His mother had difficulty coping with a full-time job and bringing up a child, so when Idle was seven, she enrolled him in the Royal Wolverhampton School as a boarder. At this time, the school was a charitable foundation dedicated to the education and maintenance of children who had lost one or both parents. Idle is quoted as saying: [...] "It was a physically abusive, bullying, harsh environment for <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>to</b> grow up in. I got used to dealing with groups of boys and getting on with life in unpleasant circumstances and being smart and funny and subversive at the expense of authority. Perfect training for Python." ...|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert, who {{had given}} the 2007 film three stars, [...] gave the sequel only one, calling it [...] "...a horrible {{experience}} of unbearable length", a phrase which later became {{the title of his}} third bad-movie-reviews collection. Later in his review, Ebert discouraged movie-goers from seeing the film by saying [...] "If you want to save yourself the ticket price, go into the kitchen, cue up a male choir singing the music of hell, and get <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>to</b> start banging pots and pans together. Then close your eyes and use your imagination." [...] He later wrote on his blog about the film, [...] "The day will come when Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will be studied in film classes and shown at cult film festivals. It will be seen, in retrospect, as marking the end of an era. Of course there will be many more CGI-based action epics, but never again one this bloated, excessive, incomprehensible, long (149 minutes) or expensive ($200 million)." [...] Ebert would continue to lambast the film (and, sometimes, the Transformers franchise in general) in other movie reviews and responses to letters and emails sent to him. Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers did not give the film any stars, considering that [...] "Revenge of the Fallen has a shot at the title 'Worst Movie of the Decade'." [...] Which he later did name it the [...] "worst film of the decade". Other reviewers, while still critical, were less damning of the film, The A.V. Club gave the film a [...] "C-", complaining about the writing and length, but mentioning the effects and action scenes were impressive. Among positive reviews, Robbie Collin of News of the World remarked [...] "It's bigger. Badder. Boobier. And many other words beginning with B, including boneheadedly brilliant.", Amy Biancolli of The Houston Chronicle called it [...] "a well-oiled, loudly revving summer action vehicle that does all that's required, and then some", Jordan Mintzer from Variety said it [...] "takes the franchise to a vastly superior level of artificial intelligence", and Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Revenge of the Fallen may be a massive overdose of popcorn greased with motor oil.

It was the one sin that hitherto they had never committed, and I fancy the old man was feeling proud of this. Luckily I caught them coming home--with ten dead rabbits strung on a pole, the twins carrying it between them on their shoulders, suggesting the picture of the spies returning from the promised land with that bunch of grapes--Veronica scouting on ahead with, every ten yards, her ear to the ground, listening for hostile footsteps. The thing that troubled her most was that she hadn't heard me coming; she seemed to fear that something had gone wrong with the laws of Nature. They had found the whole collection hanging from a tree, and had persuaded themselves that Providence must have been expecting them. I insisted on their going back with me and showing me the tree, much to their disgust. And fortunately the keeper wasn't about--they are men that love making a row. I talked some fine moral sentiment to her. But she says you have told her that it doesn't matter whether you are good or bad, things happen to you just the same; and this being so she feels she may as well enjoy herself. I asked her why she never seemed able to enjoy herself being good--I believe if I'd always had <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>to</b> bring up I'd have been a model chap myself by this time. Her answer was that she supposed she was born bad. I pointed out to her that was a reflection on you and Little Mother; and she answered she guessed she must be a 'throw-back.' Old Slee's got a dog that ought to have been a fox-terrier, but isn't, and he seems to have been explaining things to her.|$|E
60|$|But in a while, as Samson visited His wife, in {{the wheat}} harvest with <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> <b>To</b> her into her chamber he would go, The which {{her father would}} not let him do; But said, I thought that thou had'st quite forsook her, Wherefore I gave consent, and thy friend took her; Doth not her sister's beauty her's exceed, Though young? I pray then take her in her stead. And Samson said, I shall more blameless be Than they, though I shall do them injury. And then he caught three hundred foxes, and Turn'd tail to tail, and put a fiery brand Between two tails, and setting fire thereto, Into the {{standing}} corn he let them go, And burnt both shocks and standing corn and vines, And all the olives of the Philistines. Then they inquired who this thing had done, And were inform'd it was the Timnite's son; Because his father took his wife away, And gave her his companion to enjoy. And the Philistines came up, full of wrath, And burnt with fire, her and her father both. And Samson said, though you have done this thing, A further evil I will on you bring; And my avenging hand shall cease hereafter; And hip and thigh he smote them with great slaughter. And he return'd, and {{came up to the}} top Of Etam, and dwelt there upon the rock. Then the Philistines up to Judah went, And in the vale of Lehi pitched their tent. Then said the men of Judah, for what reason Are you come up against us at this season? And they made answer, We are come to bind Samson, to do to him in the same kind As he hath done to us. Then there went up Three thousand men of Judah to the top Of the rock Etam, and to Samson said, Dost thou not know that we have long obey'd The Philistines? Wherefore is it that thou Hast done this thing, to bring this evil now, Upon us, let us know it? Then said he I did to them as they have done to me. Then said they we are come, and have brought bands, To bind, and give thee up into their hands. And he made answer, you shall swear unto me, That you yourselves no injury will do me. And they reply'd, no no, we will but bind thee, We will not kill thee, but to them resign thee. And they took two new cords, and therewith tied him, And from the rock where he abode convey him: Whom when they to the camp at Lehi brought, The Philistines against him gave a shout: And mightily the Spirit of the Lord Came on him, and like burning flax each cord That was upon his arms became; the bands Were likewise separated from his hands. And he the jaw-bone of an ass espied, And took and smote them till a thousand died. Then said he, with an ass's jaw-bone I Have made mine enemies in heaps to lie. Behold I have destroy'd a thousand men With this same worthless ass's jaw. And when He made an end to speak, it came to pass He cast away the jaw-bone of the ass, And said, Now let the place where this was done Be by the name of Ramath-Lehi known. And he was sore athirst, and to the Lord He cried, and said, O Lord, thou did'st afford This great deliverance, and now shall I, By reason of my thirst fall down and die, And fall into the most accursed hands Of these uncircumcis'd Philistine bands? But God was pleas'd to cleave an hollow place, Within the jaw, from whence did water pass; Whereof when he had drunk, his spirit came As heretofore, and he reviv'd again: Wherefore that place, which is in Lehi, bore Unto this day the name of En-hakkore. And in the days the Philistines bore sway, Israel for twenty years did him obey.|$|E
