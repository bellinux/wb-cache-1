5|$|Above-ground {{nuclear tests}} by the Soviet Union and the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s and by France into the 1970s and 1980s spread a {{significant}} amount of fallout from uranium daughter isotopes around the world.

5|$|Around Europe several {{relatively}} small cities, such as Durham, England; Znojmo, Czech Republic; Riga, Latvia; and Valletta, Malta, have implemented congestion pricing to reduce traffic crowding, parking problems <b>and</b> <b>pollution,</b> {{particularly during the}} peak tourism season.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, a {{government}} committee concluded that building more roads encourages more traffic {{and that the}} way to ease congestion <b>and</b> <b>pollution</b> was to take measures to control car use rather than accommodate more.

5|$|In recent years, {{interest}} in loam construction has revived {{in the developed}} world.

5|$|The South Circular {{has been}} criticised for its poor air quality <b>and</b> <b>pollution.</b> This affects drivers, cyclists and pedestrians, {{all of which}} {{regularly}} travel along the road. A 2007 report in the Daily Telegraph {{said it was the}} eighth worst road in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary cause}} of COPD is tobacco smoke, with {{occupational}} exposure <b>and</b> <b>pollution</b> from indoor fires being significant causes in some countries. Typically these exposures must occur over several decades before symptoms develop. A person's genetic makeup also affects the risk.|$|E
5|$|Another {{option would}} be to {{implement}} fiscal devaluation, based on an idea originally developed by John Maynard Keynes in 1931. According to this neo-Keynesian logic, policy makers can increase the competitiveness of an economy by lowering corporate tax burden such as employer's social security contributions, while offsetting the loss of government revenues through higher taxes on consumption (VAT) <b>and</b> <b>pollution,</b> i.e. by pursuing an ecological tax reform.|$|E

5|$|Having {{divorced}} Rynning Koren, Hambro eventually married Christine Holter (born 1931). One of {{his wives}} bore him the daughter Ellen Hambro, {{who would later}} become director of Norway's Climate <b>and</b> <b>Pollution</b> Agency. Carl Joachim Hambro died on 19 February 1985 and was buried in Grefsen. Hambro's obituarist Finn Jor described {{him as a man}} fond of debate with a keen interest in societal issues, yet who was no front person in public dialogue, not possessing the eloquence of his father.|$|E
5|$|In 1995 and 1997, then Gov. John Rowland {{proposed}} to replace Shore Line East and the Waterbury Branch with bus service, citing a high subsidy of $18.70 per rider per trip, {{in order to}} decrease the unpopular gas tax. Lawmakers from the region called the proposals political and defended the line's ability to reduce congestion <b>and</b> <b>pollution,</b> while opponents of the line called it an example of government waste. The Shore Line East Rider's Association and other groups lobbied to save both services each time, and after public hearings a small fare increase was enacted in late 1997 instead.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, Glowee, a French company {{started selling}} bioluminescent lights, {{targeting}} shop fronts and municipal street signs as their main markets. France has {{a law that}} forbids retailers and offices from illuminating their windows between 1 and 7 {{in the morning in}} order to minimise energy consumption <b>and</b> <b>pollution.</b> Glowee hoped their product would get around this ban. They used bacteria called Aliivibrio fischeri which glow in the dark, but the maximum lifetime of their product was three days.|$|E

5|$|The Malaysian {{government}} aims {{to balance}} economic growth with environmental protection, {{but has been}} accused of favouring big business over the environment. Some state governments are now trying to counter the environmental impact <b>and</b> <b>pollution</b> created by deforestation; and the federal government is trying to cut logging by 10percent each year. 28 national parks have been established; 23 in East Malaysia and five in the Peninsular. Tourism has been limited in biodiverse areas such as Sipadan island. Animal trafficking is a large issue, and the Malaysian government is holding talks with the governments of Brunei and Indonesia to standardise anti-trafficking laws.|$|E

5|$|The smog catalyzed greater {{national}} {{awareness of}} air pollution as a serious health problem and political issue. New York City updated its local laws on air pollution control. Prompted by the smog, President Lyndon B. Johnson and members of Congress worked to pass federal legislation regulating air pollution in the United States, culminating in the 1967 Air Quality Act and the 1970 Clean Air Act. The 1966 smog is a milestone that has been compared with other pollution events, including {{the health effects of}} pollution from the September 11 attacks <b>and</b> <b>pollution</b> in China.|$|E
5|$|Writing in {{the book}} The Films of Luc Besson, Susan Hayward, {{director}} of Film Studies at the University of Exeter, considered Le Dernier Combat and The Fifth Element to be Besson's two film's which focus {{on the theme of}} environmental damage, as waste <b>and</b> <b>pollution</b> are visible throughout both films. Capitalism was also considered to be a theme; consumer commodities were said to be signs of death, such as the abandoned cars in the desert and the floating washing machines in a flooded abandoned factory.|$|E
5|$|Although Beebe {{continued}} to use Nonsuch Island as his base of operations throughout the 1930s, {{with the onset of}} World War II in 1939 it was announced that the ferry linking Bermuda to New York would soon be making its final run, requiring Beebe and his team to hastily abandon their station there. Transportation to and from Bermuda resumed in 1940, and Beebe returned there in May 1941, but the environment was slowly being transformed due to the war. The large number of military ships made docking difficult, most of the island's reefs were being destroyed in order to construct an airfield, and the combination of construction activity <b>and</b> <b>pollution</b> made observation of the sea life impossible. Appalled by the destruction, Beebe finally rented his station at Nonsuch Island to a military contractor and returned to New York.|$|E
