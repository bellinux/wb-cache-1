5|$|Booth was {{selected}} for the New South Wales hockey team in 1955 and toured New Zealand in 1956. Good performances on this tour led to his selection in the Australian Olympic squad for the 1956 Summer Olympics, but he had <b>an</b> <b>anxious</b> wait following media claims that he had received out of pocket expenses for playing cricket, which would make him a professional and therefore ineligible {{to participate in the}} Olympics. Eventually, Booth and fellow first-class cricketers Ian Dick and Maurice Foley were cleared to play for Australia. Booth then missed the 195657 Sheffield Shield season because {{he was part of the}} Australian field hockey team that finished fifth at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. Booth {{was selected}} as an inside left, but was not utilised in any of Australia's matches. In his absence, New South Wales won a fourth consecutive domestic title.|$|E

If the difficulty, real or supposed, has grown out of the circumstances of my having been connected with the negotiation at St Mary's, I feel it my duty to state to the committee that I acted from an entire conviction of its propriety and <b>an</b> <b>anxious</b> desire, on my part, to promote the welfare and accomplish {{the wishes of the}} whole people of the State in assisting to add a large and fertile tract of country to that which we already possess.|$|E

5|$|The {{portrait}} {{depicts the}} tensions and manoeuvrings of 16th century court politics. The deep red background and heavy brushstrokes establish <b>an</b> <b>anxious</b> and tense atmosphere, and the uneasy {{relationship between the}} Pope and his suitors. The pope is old, ill and tired and, to some critics' eyes, glares at Ottavio in an accusatory manner. His hat or camauro cloaks his baldness, but there are tell-tale signs of age in his long nose, dark beady eyes, stooped shoulders and long uneven beard. He is noticeably older than in the second Naples portrait of 1543. This fact {{is reinforced by the}} clock placed on the table beside him, which serves both as a memento mori and a reminder that time is running out. Given this, the presence of his grandsons indicates that the commission was prompted by thoughts of succession.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{remained}} dry for the Saturday-morning practice sessions. Häkkinen set {{the fastest}} lap {{of the third}} session at 1:51.043, quicker than his best on Friday and ahead of Frentzen, Trulli and Ralf Schumacher. Coulthard, who had an engine problem early in the session, was fifth-fastest (ahead of Button and Michael Schumacher). Alesi, Villeneuve and Sauber driver Nick Heidfeld rounded out the top ten. During the final practice session Häkkinen could not improve his time, although he remained the fastest. Button, much happier with his car's handling, set the second-fastest time. The Jordan drivers were third and fourth, with Trulli ahead of Frentzen. Ralf Schumacher and Coulthard completed the top six. Of the slower drivers, Marc Gené had <b>an</b> <b>anxious</b> moment when his Minardi car shed its engine cover but was {{able to return to}} his garage.|$|E
5|$|After <b>an</b> <b>anxious</b> {{journey of}} nine days {{during which they}} were honoured in some towns and refused entry to others, Metternich, his wife, and son Richard arrived in the Dutch city of Arnhem. They stayed until Metternich regained his strength, then reached Amsterdam and The Hague, where they waited to hear {{the results of a}} {{demonstration}} by English chartists, planned for 10 April. On 20 April they landed at Blackwall in London, where they stayed in the Brunswick Hotel in Hanover Square for a fortnight until they found a permanent residence. Metternich largely enjoyed his time in London: the Duke of Wellington, now nearly eighty, tried to keep him entertained, and there were also visits from Palmerston, Guizot (now also in exile) and Benjamin Disraeli, who enjoyed his political conversation. The sole disappointment was that Victoria herself did not acknowledge his presence in the capital. The trio leased a house, 44 Eaton Square, for four months. The younger children joined them in the summer. He followed events in Austria from afar, famously denying ever having erred; in fact, he declared the turmoil in Europe to be vindication of his policies. In Vienna, a hostile post-censorship press continued to attack him; in particular, they accused him of embezzlement and accepting bribes, prompting an investigation. Metternich was eventually cleared of the more extreme charges, and searches for evidence of the lesser ones came up empty handed. (In all likelihood Metternich's large expense claims were merely a product of the necessities of early 19th century diplomacy.) Meanwhile, as he was denied his pension, Metternich was ironically reliant on loans.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} {{the age of}} 30 without developing a serious interest in a woman, Hand thought he was destined for bachelorhood. But, during a 1901 summer holiday in the Québec resort of La Malbaie, he met 25-year-old Frances Fincke, a graduate of Bryn Mawr College. Though indecisive in most matters, he waited {{only a few weeks}} before proposing. The more cautious Fincke postponed her answer for almost a year, while Hand wrote to and occasionally saw her. He also began to look more seriously for work in New York City. The next summer, both Hand and Fincke returned to La Malbaie, {{and at the end of}} August 1902, they became engaged and kissed for the first time. They married on December 6, 1902, shortly after Hand had accepted a post with the Manhattan law firm of Zabriskie, Burrill & Murray. The couple had three daughters: Mary Deshon (born 1905), Frances (born 1907), and Constance (born 1909). Hand proved <b>an</b> <b>anxious</b> husband and father. He corresponded regularly with his doctor brother-in-law about initial difficulties in conceiving and about his children's illnesses. He survived pneumonia in February 1905, taking months to recover.|$|E
5|$|The No. 9 Audi {{began to}} fall off the race pace after {{multiple}} visits to the garage for repairs to its hybrid system, but the No. 7 Audi kept fighting as Lotterer reset the fastest lap of the race with a three minutes and 17.476 seconds time. KCMG had <b>an</b> <b>anxious</b> moment when Lapierre missed the Indianapolis corner, but recovered with marshal assistance without losing the LMP2 class lead. The No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari slowed on course {{and came to the}} garage with gearbox issues, handing the LMGTE Pro lead back to Corvette and allowing the No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari to climb to second place after recovering from its earlier issues. Vanthoor drove his car into his pitbox with gearbox problems but his team were unable to repair it before the race's conclusion and retired. Jann Mardenborough's Nissan came to a halt at the Porsche Curves after smoke bellowed out of {{the front of the car}} as the gearbox failed, leaving Nissan with a single car left circulating. Light rain {{began to fall}} on portions of the circuit in the final hour, but it was not heavy enough to affect the race. Dalla Lana, having led the previous 125 laps in LMGTE Am and within forty five minutes of the race finish, went straight on at the Ford Chicane and crashed heavily into an outside tyre barrier, ending the car's run and promoting the SMP Ferrari to the class lead which it held to the finish. Dalla Lana was unhurt.|$|E

Aeneas prays to Jupiter to quench the fires, which the god does with a torrential rainstorm. <b>An</b> <b>anxious</b> Aeneas is comforted by a vision of his father, who tells {{him to go to}} the underworld to receive a vision of his and Rome's future. In return for safe passage to Italy, the gods, by order of Jupiter, will receive one of Aeneas's men as a sacrifice: Palinurus, who steers Aeneas's ship by night, falls overboard.|$|E
25|$|For Neff's {{office at}} Pacific All Risk, Wilder and set {{designer}} Hal Pereira conspired {{to create a}} little in-house joke, typical of Billy Wilder. In the opening scenes, as Walter Neff stumbles off the elevator {{on his way to}} his office to record his confession, the vast two-tiered office is empty and dark. With the camera following him, Neff lurches towards the balcony railing overlooking rows and rows of uniform corporate desks. Neff turns left, but the camera continues forward until it reaches the brink and stares down for <b>an</b> <b>anxious</b> moment into a colorless American business purgatory. Here, Pereira is said to have copied an existing office: the corporate headquarters of Paramount Pictures in New York City.|$|E
25|$|In 1814, after Napoleon's defeat, nobility from {{throughout}} Europe attended celebrations in London, but Caroline was excluded. George's {{relationship with his}} daughter was also deteriorating, as Charlotte sought greater freedom from her father's strictures. On 12 July, he informed Charlotte that she would henceforth be confined at Cranbourne Lodge, Windsor, that her household would be replaced, and {{that she could have}} no visitors except her grandmother, Queen Charlotte, once a week. Horrified, Charlotte ran away to her mother's house in Bayswater. After <b>an</b> <b>anxious</b> night, Charlotte was eventually persuaded to return to her father by Brougham, since legally she could be placed in her father's care and there was a danger of public disorder against George, which might prejudice Charlotte's position if she continued to disobey him.|$|E

25|$|Cercle made a {{slow start}} to the 1929–30 season, {{entering}} the mid-season winter break in sixth place and seven points adrift of leaders Antwerp. Nonetheless, by the closing weekend of the season they had narrowed the gap to a single point; the final game saw them score a 4–1 victory at home to Lierse SK. The side then faced <b>an</b> <b>anxious</b> wait for the result of Antwerp against 10th placed Standard Liège, contemporary telecommunication facilities at grounds being poor. In the end, the news reached team captain Florimond Vanhalme that Antwerp had lost 3–5, meaning Cercle had won their third and (thus far) final title. Because of this title Cercle were invited {{to take part in}} the Coupe des Nations, which is regarded as the predecessor of the Champions League.|$|E
25|$|PC-552 {{performed}} {{protection for}} convoys going from New York (berthed at Tompkinsville) to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and back. For the most part, serious maintenance was performed at Tompkinsville such as replacing guns. Tompkinsville {{was also the}} main source for ammunition and new personnel. The {{first half of the}} year was similar to how 1942 was: periodic contacts with potential enemy submarines resulting in instant attacks by PC-552, great care given to zigzagging convoys, detailed deck log entries, etc. These were anxious, serious men at <b>an</b> <b>anxious,</b> serious task. The last half of the year, the convoys became routine. There were no contacts with potential enemies, there were less frequent convoys, and the deck log entries became cursory. Often, not even the name of the mooring station was mentioned. It apparently was obvious to all at the time where they berthed although not to us, reading the deck log entries today.|$|E

500|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) and Howard (Melissa Leo) {{prepare to}} testify in the murder trial of [...] "Pony" [...] Johnson (Geoffrey C. Ewing). State {{prosecutor}} Danvers (Željko Ivanek) tells <b>an</b> <b>anxious</b> Howard that the case depends entirely on her testimony. Felton, who in contrast to Howard is very relaxed, claims Howard {{is in love with}} Danvers, which she vehemently denies. Howard testifies, but nervously fumbles facts and allows defense attorney Darin Russom (Michael Willis) to create reasonable doubt to the jury. After receiving reassurance from Danvers, however, Howard is recalled and performs much better, seriously damaging Russom's case. Johnson is found guilty of murder and Danvers offers to buy Howard dinner, which she accepts much to Felton's amusement.|$|E
500|$|Describing Dot, Brown has said, [...] "I love playing her– she's {{a strong}} character. Dear old Dot, she's got strong moral views and odd {{religious}} beliefs, but her heart's {{in the right}} place. She has that awful worried {{expression on her face}} the whole time". Brown has noted the changes within Dot since the show's inception, saying that initially Dot was sharp and selfish, but since her character remarried in 2002, she has gained security and has [...] "no reason to have the hypochondria she had in the past [...] She's become more caring over the years. She enjoys the company of young people. She loves her church. She can get in <b>an</b> <b>anxious</b> state– I like it when Dot's hysterical! She's also amusing, mostly because she doesn't realise she is".|$|E
500|$|The theme song, [...] "Rain", {{was written}} and {{composed}} by Senri Oe, and was originally a popular Japanese song in 1988. Shinkai enjoyed listening to Oe's song regularly while attending university, and since {{one of the}} film's themes was rain, {{it was the first}} song that came to mind while he worked on the production. He particularly liked the song because its lyrics reflected daily life, much like the film. The song was remade for the film in 2013, and sung by Motohiro Hata. Shinkai met Hata on several occasions and noted a similarity between Hata's passion as an artisan and that of the character Takao. Shinkai also felt that Hata's voice was perfect because to him it carried an [...] "underlying loneliness" [...] and [...] "sounded a little like <b>an</b> <b>anxious</b> young man".|$|E
