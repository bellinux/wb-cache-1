5|$|While {{he still}} felt a disdain for public life, Tchaikovsky now {{participated in it}} for two reasons—his {{increasing}} celebrity, and what he felt was his duty to promote Russian music. To this end, he helped support his former pupil Sergei Taneyev, {{now director of the}} Moscow Conservatory, by attending student examinations and negotiating the sometimes sensitive relations among various members of the staff. Tchaikovsky also served as director of the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society during the 1889–90 season. In this post, he invited a number of international celebrities to conduct, including Johannes Brahms, Antonín Dvořák and Jules Massenet. Tchaikovsky promoted Russian music both in his own compositions and in his role as a guest conductor. In January 1887 he substituted at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow on short notice for the first three performances of his opera Cherevichki. Conducting was something the composer had wanted to master for at least a decade, as he saw that success outside Russia depended to some extent on conducting his own works. Within a year of the Cherevichki performances, Tchaikovsky was in considerable demand throughout Europe and Russia, which helped him overcome <b>a</b> <b>life-long</b> stage fright and boosted his self-assurance.|$|E

40|$|Localisation and mapping {{relies on}} the {{representation}} and recognition of features or patterns detected in sensor data. An important aspect is the temporal relationship of observa-tions in sensor data streams. This article proposes a new ap-proach for simultaneous localisation and mapping based on temporal relations {{in the flow of}} characteristic events in the sensor data channels. A dynamical system is employed to acquire these correla-tions between simultaneous and sequential events from dif-ferent sources, to map causal sequences, while considering time spans, and to recognise previously observed patterns (localisation). While this system is applicable to sensor mo-dalities with different characteristics and timing behav-iours, it is especially suitable for distributed computing. Mapping and localisation take place simultaneously in <b>an</b> <b>life-long</b> unsupervised distributed on-line learning process. The dynamical system has been implemented as a distribut-ed realtime system with symmetric processes. A realtime clustering network reduces the dimension of raw sensor da-ta; cluster transitions are used as input for the dynamical mapping system. Results from physical experiments with one sensor modality are presented. 1...|$|R

As early as 1892, he wrote: [...] "If I had not made magic my constant study I could not have written a single word of my Blake book, nor would The Countess Kathleen ever have come to exist. The mystical life is the centre of all that I do and all that I think and all that I write." [...] His mystical interests—also inspired by a study of Hinduism, under the Theosophist Mohini Chatterjee, and the occult—formed much of the basis of his late poetry.

[...] In June 1883, visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months.

There, Hand developed <b>a</b> <b>life-long</b> friendship with his cousin and future colleague Augustus Noble Hand, two years his senior.
