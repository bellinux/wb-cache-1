5|$|A {{central theme}} of President Obama's inaugural address was a call to restore responsibility—both in terms of {{accountability}} in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved. Obama's address did not have memorable sound bite phrases. Instead, he used traditional references to connect his new <b>administration</b> <b>with</b> the nation's history in a speech that was understated deliberately, according to rhetoric expert James Mackin.|$|E

5|$|Bristol City council {{consists}} of 70 councillors representing 35 wards, with two per ward serving four-year terms. Councillors are elected in thirds, with elections held {{in three years}} out of every four-year period. Thus, since wards do not have both councillors up for election at the same time, two-thirds of the wards participate in each election. Although the council was long dominated by the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats have grown strong {{in the city and}} (as the largest party) took minority control of the council after the 2005 election. In 2007, Labour and the Conservatives united to defeat the Liberal Democrat administration; Labour ruled the council as a minority <b>administration,</b> <b>with</b> Helen Holland as council leader.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{authority}} {{collapsed in}} England where, in the King's absence, Isabella's faction {{took over the}} <b>administration</b> <b>with</b> {{the support of the}} Church. Her forces surrounded Bristol, where Hugh Despenser the Elder had taken shelter; he surrendered and was promptly executed. Edward and Hugh the Younger fled their castle around 2 November, leaving behind jewellery, considerable supplies and at least £13,000 in cash, possibly once again hoping to reach Ireland, but on 16 November they were betrayed and captured by a search party north of Caerphilly. Edward was escorted first to Monmouth Castle, and from there back into England, where he was held at Henry of Lancaster's fortress at Kenilworth. The King's final remaining forces, by now besieged in Caerphilly Castle, surrendered after five months in April 1327.|$|E

In June, while attending the WWDC in Silicon Valley, California, Obama called for tech companies to add women for the diversifying of their ranks. In July, Obama honored Eunice Shriver at the 2017 ESPY Awards. In September, Obama delivered an address at the tech conference in Utah charging the Trump <b>administration</b> <b>with</b> having a fearful White House, appeared in a video for the Global Citizens Festival advocating more attention to giving young girls an education, and attended the Inbound 2017 conference in Boston.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, Starosta was {{unveiled}} as one of ten new signings made by Colin Todd at League Two side Darlington following their spell in <b>administration.</b> <b>With</b> the club still in financial difficulty however, he left by mutual consent before the season even started as Darlington tried to cut the wage bill. Starosta then spent a spell with Conference North side Alfreton Town, before, seeking a new club, he took up an offer from Australian Victorian Premier League side Dandenong Thunder, where he played on non-contract terms for a period, but soon left citing the poor quality of football on offer. Starosta returned to the UK and signed a short term deal with Frickley Athletic of the Northern Premier League in March 2011, but failed to make an appearance for the club.|$|E
5|$|Mogadishu Stadium was {{constructed}} in 1978 during the Barre <b>administration,</b> <b>with</b> the assistance of Chinese engineers. The facility was mainly used for hosting sporting activities, such as the Somalia Cup and for football matches with teams from the Somalia League. Presidential addresses and political rallies, among other events, were also held there. In September 2013, the Somali federal government and its Chinese counterpart signed an official cooperation agreement in Mogadishu {{as part of a}} five-year national recovery plan in Somalia. The pact will see the Chinese authorities reconstruct several major infrastructural landmarks, including the Mogadishu Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Revolts also {{occurred}} across {{the rest of}} England, particularly in the cities of the north, traditionally centres of political unrest. In the town of Beverley, violence broke out between the richer mercantile elite and the poorer townspeople during May. By {{the end of the}} month the rebels had taken power and replaced the former town <b>administration</b> <b>with</b> their own. The rebels attempted to enlist the support of Alexander Neville, the Archbishop of York, and in June forced the former town government to agree to arbitration through Neville. Peace was restored in June 1382 but tensions continued to simmer for many years.|$|E

5|$|The February Revolution was {{positively}} {{accepted by the}} Armenians because it ended the autocratic rule of Nicholas II. The Special Transcaucasian Committee (known as OZAKOM) {{was set up in}} the South Caucasus by the Russian Provisional Government. In April 1917, Andranik initiated the publication of the newspaper Hayastan (Armenia) in Tiflis. Vahan Totovents became the editor of this non-partisan, Ottoman Armenian-orientated newspaper. Until December 1917, Andranik remained in the South Caucasus where he sought to help the Armenian refugees from the Ottoman Empire in their search for basic needs. The provisional government decree of 9 May 1917 put Turkish Armenia under civil <b>administration,</b> <b>with</b> Armenians holding key positions. About 150,000 local Armenians began to rebuild devastated Turkish Armenia; however the Russian army units gradually disintegrated and many soldiers deserted and returned to Russia.|$|E
5|$|The {{city council}} {{is made up}} of 42 councillors. After the May 2014 local elections, the Conservatives formed a {{minority}} <b>administration</b> <b>with</b> just 12councillors.

Councillors are returned from 14wards, with each ward having three councillors and a four-year term. The leader of the council is the Conservative Donna Jones. The position of Lord Mayor of Portsmouth is usually held for a one-year period.|$|E
5|$|Turner and Meyszner clashed {{continually}} throughout 1942, as Meyszner {{sought to}} remove all police matters from Turner's remit, including {{the supervision of the}} security forces of the Serbian collaborationist regime. In response, Turner fought hard to maintain control over these areas. Meyszner believed the only way to maintain peace and security was the use of brutal police methods; Turner wanted to empower the Nedić regime and then replace the military <b>administration</b> <b>with</b> a civil one, akin to the Reichskommissariat Niederlande, with himself as Reichskommissar (governor). Meyszner attempted to have Turner's staff downgraded and incorporated into Bader's staff but Wolff intervened to prevent this. However, Turner's approach was also seriously out-of-step with the Wehrmacht, which considered the territory a combat zone and wanted to eliminate inefficiencies and overlapping jurisdictions.|$|E
