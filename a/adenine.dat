5|$|Nicotinamide <b>adenine</b> {{dinucleotide}} (NAD) is a coenzyme {{found in}} all living cells. The compound is a dinucleotide, because it consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphate groups. One nucleotide contains an <b>adenine</b> base and the other nicotinamide. Nicotinamide <b>adenine</b> dinucleotide exists in two forms: an oxidized and reduced form abbreviated as NAD and NADH respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{complementary}} base to <b>adenine</b> in DNA is thymine, {{whereas in}} RNA, it is uracil, {{which is an}} unmethylated form of thymine.|$|E
5|$|Most organisms {{synthesize}} NAD {{from simple}} components. The {{specific set of}} reactions differs among organisms, but a common feature is the generation of quinolinic acid (QA) from an amino acid—either tryptophan (Trp) in animals and some bacteria, or aspartic acid (Asp) in some bacteria and plants. The quinolinic acid is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) by transfer of a phosphoribose moiety. An adenylate moiety is then transferred to form nicotinic acid <b>adenine</b> dinucleotide (NaAD). Finally, the nicotinic acid moiety in NaAD is amidated to a nicotinamide (Nam) moiety, forming nicotinamide <b>adenine</b> dinucleotide.|$|E
40|$|New and {{efficient}} methods for {{the synthesis of}} N 1 -substituted and C 6 -substitued <b>adenines</b> were developed from the easily accessible 5 -aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamidines. Condensation of these compounds with triethyl orthoformate led to the selective synthesis of the N 1 -substituted <b>adenines.</b> Regioselective preparation of C 6 -substituted <b>adenines</b> could be accomplished when the same precursors were combined with dimethylformamide diethyl acetal. These C 6 -substituted <b>adenines</b> could also {{be obtained from the}} N 1 -substituted <b>adenines</b> by Dimroth rearrangement in the presence of dimethyl amine.

40|$|The {{formation}} of A-minor motifs, mediated by <b>adenines</b> binding into the shallow/minor groove of stacked and helical Watson-Crick base pairs, is described. The conformations of the bacterial ribosomal decoding A site in various crystal structures are reviewed. The <b>adenines</b> A 1492 and A 1493 of the A site are seen either tucked in within the internal loop or bulging out and poised for interaction. This dynamic equilibrium {{contributes to the}} decoding process of the codon:anticodon base pairings. Aminoglycoside antibiotics lock the con{{formation of}} the A site in a single state with bulged-out <b>adenines</b> and thereby disrupt regulation of the decoding process.

40|$|Positioning {{of release}} factor eRF 1 toward <b>adenines</b> and the ribose-phosphate {{backbone}} of the UAAA stop signal in the ribosomal decoding site was studied using messenger RNA (mRNA) analogs containing stop signal UAA/UAAA and a photoactivatable cross-linker at definite locations. The human eRF 1 peptides cross-linked to these analogs were identified. Cross-linkers on the <b>adenines</b> at the 2 nd, 3 rd or 4 th position modified eRF 1 near the conserved YxCxxxF loop (positions 125 – 131 in the N domain), but cross-linker at the 4 th position mainly modified the tripeptide 26 -AAR- 28. This tripeptide cross-linked also with derivatized 3 ′-phosphate of UAA, while the same cross-linker at the 3 ′-phosphate of UAAA modified both the 26 – 28 and 67 – 73 fragments. A comparison of the results with those obtained earlier with mRNA analogs bearing a similar cross-linker at the guanines indicates that positioning of eRF 1 toward <b>adenines</b> and guanines of stop signals in the 80 S termination complex is different. Molecular modeling of eRF 1 in the 80 S termination complex showed that eRF 1 fragments neighboring guanines and <b>adenines</b> of stop signals are compatible with different N domain conformations of eRF 1. These conformations vary by positioning of stop signal purines toward the universally conserved dipeptide 31 -GT- 32, which neighbors guanines but is oriented more distantly from <b>adenines...</b>|$|R
5|$|Nicotinamide <b>adenine</b> {{dinucleotide}} {{has several}} essential roles in metabolism. It {{acts as a}} coenzyme in redox reactions, as a donor of ADP-ribose moieties in ADP-ribosylation reactions, as a precursor of the second messenger molecule cyclic ADP-ribose, as well as acting as a substrate for bacterial DNA ligases {{and a group of}} enzymes called sirtuins that use NAD to remove acetyl groups from proteins. In addition to these metabolic functions, NAD+ emerges as an <b>adenine</b> nucleotide that can be released from cells spontaneously and by regulated mechanisms, and can therefore have important extracellular roles.|$|E
5|$|Nicotinamide <b>adenine</b> dinucleotide, {{like all}} dinucleotides, {{consists}} of two nucleosides joined {{by a pair of}} bridging phosphate groups. The nucleosides each contain a ribose ring, one with <b>adenine</b> attached to the first carbon atom (the 1' position) and the other with nicotinamide at this position. The nicotinamide moiety can be attached in two orientations to this anomeric carbon atom. Because of these two possible structures, the compound exists as two diastereomers. It is the β-nicotinamide diastereomer of NAD that is found in organisms. These nucleotides are joined together by a bridge of two phosphate groups through the 5' carbons.|$|E
5|$|RNA is {{transcribed}} {{with only}} four bases (<b>adenine,</b> cytosine, guanine and uracil), but these bases and attached sugars {{can be modified}} in numerous ways as the RNAs mature. Pseudouridine (Ψ), in which the linkage between uracil and ribose is changed from a C–N bond to a C–C bond, and ribothymidine (T) are found in various places (the most notable ones being in the TΨC loop of tRNA). Another notable modified base is hypoxanthine, a deaminated <b>adenine</b> base whose nucleoside is called inosine (I). Inosine {{plays a key role}} in the wobble hypothesis of the genetic code.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBromoacetaldehyde (BAA) {{was used}} to study the {{secondary}} structure of DNA in λ-phage particles. It was determined that about 1 % of the <b>adenines</b> in the intraphage λ-DNA reacts readily with BAA, thus, they are placed in DNA sites with disturbed complementary interactions. These <b>adenines</b> {{are close to the}} tryptophan residues of the phage protein. Fluorescence emission of ϵA in the intraphage DNA is dramatically quenched. This, apparently, indicates the interaction between ϵA and Trp- and/or Tyr- and/or Met-residues of phage protein...|$|R
40|$|Translation {{initiation}} {{requires the}} precise positioning of a ribosome {{at the start}} codon. The major signals of bacterial mRNA that direct the ribosome to a translational start site are the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence within the untranslated leader and the start codon. Evidence {{for the presence of}} many non-SD-led genes in prokaryotes provides a motive for studying additional interactions between ribosomes and mRNA that contribute to translation initiation. A high incidence of <b>adenines</b> has been reported downstream of the start codon for many Escherichia coli genes, and addition of downstream adenine-rich sequences increases expression from several genes in E. coli. Here we describe site-directed mutagenesis of the E. coli aroL, pncB, and cysJ coding sequences that was used to assess the contribution of naturally occurring <b>adenines</b> to in vivo expression and in vitro ribosome binding from mRNAs with different SD-containing untranslated leaders. Base substitutions that decreased the downstream <b>adenines</b> by one or two nucleotides decreased expression significantly from aroL-, pncB-, and cysJ-lacZ fusions; mutations that increased downstream <b>adenines</b> by one or two nucleotides increased expression significantly from aroL- and cysJ-lacZ fusions. Using primer extension inhibition (toeprint) and filter binding assays to measure ribosome binding, the changes in in vivo expression correlated closely with changes in in vitro ribosome binding strength. Our data are consistent with a model in which downstream <b>adenines</b> influence expression through their effects on the mRNA-ribosome association rate and the amount of ternary complex formed. This work provides evidence that adenine-rich sequence motifs might serve as a general enhancer of E. coli translation...|$|R
40|$|Reaction of 5 S RNA with chlorocetaldehyde {{leads to}} the {{conversion}} of unpaired <b>adenines</b> to the fluorescent 1,N 6 -etheno-adenine derivatives. Up to 16 of the 23 <b>adenines</b> in free 5 S RNA can be modified, the fastest reacting are A 29, A 34, A 57 - 59. Partial modification of <b>adenines</b> in this area results in a 20 % reduction in the efficiency of 5 S RNA incorporation into 50 S subunits during reconstitution and a 15 % reduction in the activity of these subunits in peptide synthesis. Fluorescence from 1,N 6 -etheno-adenine is quenched in free 5 S RNA and is not detectably further influenced by the binding of proteins E-L 5, E-L 18 and E-L 25, nor by {{the first stage of}} the two step E. coli 50 S subunit reconstitution procedure. However, the fluorescence is further reduced to near zero after the second step of the reconstitution. Thus, 5 S RNS free in solution contains 16 unpaired <b>adenines,</b> those in the region between A 29 and A 59 particularly accessible to modification by chlorocetaldehyde. This portion of the 5 S RNA molecule appears to undergo either a conformational change or interacts with other ribosomal components in the last stage of subunit reassembly...|$|R
5|$|Two {{chains of}} DNA twist {{around each other}} to form a DNA double helix with the phosphate-sugar {{backbone}} spiralling around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with <b>adenine</b> base pairing to thymine and guanine to cytosine. The specificity of base pairing occurs because <b>adenine</b> and thymine align to form two hydrogen bonds, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.|$|E
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} needed in small quantities that cannot {{be made in}} cells. In human nutrition, most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells. Nicotinamide <b>adenine</b> dinucleotide (NAD+), a derivative of vitamin B3 (niacin), is an important coenzyme {{that acts as a}} hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the cell that need to reduce their substrates. Nicotinamide <b>adenine</b> dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD+/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP+/NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up work in {{response}} to criticism and challenges included the purification and crystallization, by Moses Kunitz in 1948, of a DNA depolymerase (deoxyribonuclease I), and precise work by Rollin Hotchkiss showing that virtually all the detected nitrogen in the purified DNA came from glycine, a breakdown product of the nucleotide base <b>adenine,</b> and that undetected protein contamination was at most 0.02% by Hotchkiss's estimation.|$|E
25|$|Transcription {{termination}} in eukaryotes is {{less well}} understood than in bacteria, but involves cleavage {{of the new}} transcript followed by template-independent addition of <b>adenines</b> at its new 3' end, in a process called polyadenylation.|$|R
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, DNA {{cytosine}} methylase targets CCAGG and CCTGG sites to methylate cytosine at the C5 position (C meC(A/T) GG). The other methylase enzyme, EcoKI, causes methylation of <b>adenines</b> in the sequences AAC(N6)GTGC and GCAC(N6)GTT.|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{modification}} {{was used}} to study the conformational changes occurring in yeast tRNAPhe after the Y-base excision. The chemical probe was the adenine- and cytosine-specific reagent chloroacetaldehyde. Comparison of the modification patterns in tRNAPhe and tRNAPhe-Y shows that seven bases, <b>adenines</b> 35, 36 and 38 in the anticodon loop and <b>adenines</b> 73, 76 and cytosines 74, 75 in the 3 '-terminus were modified in both tRNAs with a quantitative difference in the modification level of the anticodon loop bases. The most interesting, however, is the qualitative difference consisting in modification of cytosine- 60 in the T psi C loop of tRNAPhe-Y. Some aspects of the mechanism of this long-distance conformational transition are briefly discussed...|$|R
5|$|Polyadenylation is the {{addition}} of a poly(A) tail to a messenger RNA. The poly(A) tail consists of multiple adenosine monophosphates; in other words, it is a stretch of RNA that has only <b>adenine</b> bases. In eukaryotes, polyadenylation is part of the process that produces mature messenger RNA (mRNA) for translation. It, therefore, forms part of the larger process of gene expression.|$|E
5|$|The {{most ancient}} polyadenylating enzyme is polynucleotide phosphorylase. This enzyme {{is part of}} both the {{bacterial}} degradosome and the archaeal exosome, two closely related complexes that recycle RNA into nucleotides. This enzyme degrades RNA by attacking the bond between the 3'-most nucleotides with a phosphate, breaking off a diphosphate nucleotide. This reaction is reversible, and so the enzyme can also extend RNA with more nucleotides. The heteropolymeric tail added by polynucleotide phosphorylase is very rich in <b>adenine.</b> The choice of <b>adenine</b> is most likely the result of higher ADP concentrations than other nucleotides {{as a result of}} using ATP as an energy currency, making it more likely to be incorporated in this tail in early lifeforms. It has been suggested that the involvement of adenine-rich tails in RNA degradation prompted the later evolution of polyadenylate polymerases (the enzymes that produce poly(A) tails with no other nucleotides in them).|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of living organisms encode their genes in long strands of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). DNA consists of a chain made from four types of nucleotide subunits, each composed of: a five-carbon sugar (2'-deoxyribose), a phosphate group, {{and one of the}} four bases <b>adenine,</b> cytosine, guanine, and thymine.|$|E
40|$|E. coli 50 S ribosomal {{subunits}} were {{reacted with}} monoperphthalic acid under {{conditions in which}} non-base paired <b>adenines</b> are modified to their 1 -N-oxides. 5 S RNA was isolated from such chemically reacted subunits and the two modified <b>adenines</b> were identified as A 73 and A 99. The modified 5 S RNA, when used in reconstitution of 50 S subunits, yielded particles with reduced biological activity (50 %). The results are discussed {{with respect to a}} recently proposed three-dimensional structure for 5 S RNA, the interaction of the RNA with proteins E-L 5, E-L 18 and E-L 25 and previously proposed interactions of 5 S RNA with tRNA, 16 S and 23 S ribosomal RNAs...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{stacking}} interactions on the oxidation potentials of single strand oligonucleotides containing {{up to four}} consecutive <b>adenines,</b> alternated with thymines and cytosines in different sequences and ratios, have been determined by means of differential pulse voltammetry. Voltammetric measurements point toward the establishment in solution of structured oligonucleotide conformations, in which the nucleobases are well stacked altogether. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm that finding, indicating that single strands assume geometrical parameters characteristic of the B-DNA form. The analysis of the voltammetric signals {{in terms of a}} simple effective tight binding quantum model leads one to infer a robust set of parameters for treating hole transfer in one-electron-oxidized DNA containing <b>adenines</b> and thymines...|$|R
40|$|The structural/dynamical {{properties}} of three truncated octahedral DNA nano-cages composed by identical double helices but single strand linkers with different composition, namely 7 thymidines, 7 <b>adenines,</b> and 7 alternated thymidines and <b>adenines,</b> {{have been investigated}} through classical molecular dynamics simulations. Trajectories have been analyzed to investigate {{the role of the}} linkers in defining nano-cages stability and flexibility, including possible influence on the internal cages motions. The data indicate that the cages behavior is almost identical and that the structural/dynamical parameters measured along the trajectories are not particularly affected by the presence of different bases. These results demonstrate that the constraints imposed by the nano-structure geometry are the main factor in modulating these properties...|$|R
5|$|These codes make {{it easier}} and shorter to write down the amino acid {{sequences}} that make up proteins. The nucleotide bases {{are made up of}} purines (<b>adenine</b> and guanine) and pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine or uracil). These nucleotide bases make up DNA and RNA. These nucleotide base codes make the genome of an organism much smaller and easier to read.|$|E
5|$|Both NAD and NADH {{strongly}} absorb {{ultraviolet light}} {{because of the}} <b>adenine.</b> For example, peak absorption of NAD is at a wavelength of 259nanometers (nm), with an extinction coefficient of 16,900M−1cm−1. NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths, with a second peak in UV absorption at 339nm with an extinction coefficient of 6,220M−1cm−1. This difference in the ultraviolet absorption spectra between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes at higher wavelengths makes it simple to measure the conversion of one to another in enzyme assays– by measuring the amount of UV absorption at 340nm using a spectrophotometer.|$|E
5|$|Building {{blocks of}} DNA (<b>adenine,</b> guanine, and related organic molecules) {{may have been}} formed extraterrestrially in outer space. Complex DNA and RNA organic {{compounds}} of life, including uracil, cytosine, and thymine, have also been formed in the laboratory under conditions mimicking those found in outer space, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar cosmic dust and gas clouds.|$|E
40|$|Cations {{play a very}} {{important}} role in structural stabilization of various unusual DNA structures. Quadruplexes are a class of unusual DNA structures which are formed by number of single stranded DNA molecules associating by Hoogsteen base pairing. These structures are rich in guanines and there is strong evidence to support that they are formed at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. G-quadruplex structures are intimately related to the monovalent cations like sodium and potassium, which are physiologically abundant. The role of these monovalent cations and the effect of substituting terminal thymines with <b>adenines</b> was investigated by multinuclear NMR. The role of terminal thymines in G-quadruplex structure has been established before, but the substitution of thymines and <b>adenines</b> has been dealt here for the first time. The exchange kinetics of cation e. g. 23 Na+ from the quadruplex core is determined by the terminal nucleotides present in the oligonucleotide sequence. The sequences d(AAGGGGA), d(AGGGGA) and d(AAGGGGAA) were used to investigate the exchange kinetics of cations from the quadruplex core. Cations bind to the quadruplex structures in namely two ways, weak electrostatic binding and specific binding inside. The flanking <b>adenines</b> slow down the exchange kinetics of the cations from the quadruplex core. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{family of}} 4 -hydroxypiperidines based mono, bis, tris, and tetrakis {{unimolecular}} compounds served as efficient ligands {{in combination with}} inexpensive CuI to catalyze Ullmann coupling reactions. A wide range of N-arylated indoles, benzimidazoles, imidazoles, pyrroles, and <b>adenines</b> were synthesized in moderate to excellent yields...|$|R
40|$|Caught in the oxirane: Naphthalene diimides {{conjugated}} to a quinone methide and an oxirane {{have been}} synthesized and investigated as selective DNA G-quadruplex alkylating agents. The oxirane derivative generates a stable adduct with a G-quadruplex and shows selective alkylation {{of the loop}} <b>adenines,</b> as illustrated...|$|R
5|$|Coenzymes {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} {{that can be}} loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another. Examples include NADH, NADPH and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Some coenzymes, such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin <b>adenine</b> dinucleotide (FAD), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), and tetrahydrofolate (THF), are derived from vitamins. These coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body de novo and closely related compounds (vitamins) must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include the hydride ion (H−) carried by NAD or NADP+, the phosphate group carried by adenosine triphosphate, the acetyl group carried by coenzyme A, formyl, methenyl or methyl groups carried by folic acid and the methyl group carried by S-adenosylmethionine.|$|E
5|$|In metabolism, {{nicotinamide}} <b>adenine</b> dinucleotide {{is involved}} in redox reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another. The coenzyme is, therefore, found in two forms in cells: NAD is an oxidizing agent– it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes reduced. This reaction forms NADH, which can then {{be used as a}} reducing agent to donate electrons. These electron transfer reactions are the main function of NAD. However, it is also used in other cellular processes, the most notable one being a substrate of enzymes that add or remove chemical groups from proteins, in posttranslational modifications. Because of the importance of these functions, the enzymes involved in NAD metabolism are targets for drug discovery.|$|E
5|$|In organisms, NAD can be {{synthesized}} {{from simple}} building-blocks (de novo) from the amino acids tryptophan or aspartic acid. In an alternative fashion, more complex {{components of the}} coenzymes are taken up from food as the vitamin called niacin. Similar compounds are released by reactions that break down the structure of NAD. These preformed components then pass through a salvage pathway that recycles {{them back into the}} active form. Some NAD is also converted into nicotinamide <b>adenine</b> dinucleotide phosphate (NADP); the chemistry of this related coenzyme {{is similar to that of}} NAD, but it has different roles in metabolism.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{have used}} a {{diethylpyrocarbonate}} (DEPC) modification [(1976) Prog. Nucl. Acids Res. 16, 189 – 262] to probe the accessibility of <b>adenines</b> essential for coat protein binding in the MS 2 translational operator [(1983) Biochemistry 22, 2601 – 2610, 2610 – 2615, 4723 – 4730; (1987) Biochemistry 26, 1563 – 1568]. The essential <b>adenines</b> are apparently hyperreactive with this reagent relative to other sites within the same molecule. Variation of ionic strength, pH and divalent cation concentrations reveal the existence of two distinct conformers of the RNA operator as judged by DEPC reactivity. We propose that the hyperreactivity observed {{is due to the}} participation of neighbouring bases in the DEPC modification reaction and {{can be used as a}} novel structural probe...|$|R
