40|$|Background: Every year in {{all over}} the world, the {{incidence}} of nasopharyngeal carcinoma increases. In Indonesia, there was no accurate data. To get an accurate result, without using this standardization, it would be unclear if differing mortality rates were due to age, sex or {{as a result of}} other factors. This study aimed to know the incidence of NPC in Kariadi Central Hospital during 2002 – 2011, the distribution trend based on age and sex, using the new WHO world standard, <b>Age</b> <b>Standardization</b> Rates (ASR) and <b>Age</b> <b>Standardization</b> Cancer Ratio (ASCR). Objectives: This study aimed to know the incidence of nasopharyngeal cancer in Dr. Kariadi Central Hospital during 2002 – 2011, the distribution trend based on age and sex, by counting the <b>age</b> <b>standardization</b> rates (ASR) and <b>age</b> <b>standardization</b> cancer ratio (ASCR) score. Methods: It was a descriptive retrospective research using secondary data from medical record of patients of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, diagnosed by Anatomic Pathology Laboratory of Kariadi Hospital-Medical Faculty Diponegoro University during January 1 st, 2002 - December 31 st, 2011. Data recorded were anatomic pathology diagnose that came from tissue biopsy or surgery, age & sex which were included clearly in medical record. The collected data were analysed by Microsoft Excel and presented descriptively. Result: There was {{an increase in the number}} of NPC patients from year 2002 until 2011, which at the beginning there was only 20 patients in 2002 but then increased to 95 in 2011. The highest number of patient is in the range of 45 - 49 years old with a total of 78 patients. Based on sex, the women ASR is higher than men ASR, the comparison between men ASR and women ASR in year 2002 - 2011 is 1 : 1, 4 Conclusion: The highest number of patient is in the range of 45 - 49 years old with a total of 78 patients. Based on age, ASR and ASCR are consistently increase, exept in year 2002 and 2003 if it compare with the study before and compare in every year. However, based on sex, this study does not follow the trend. It can be caused by unavailability of data in some groups of age, so that the counting result became inaccurate.

40|$|Background: The {{sustainable}} incidence data of Head and Neck Cancer {{is poorly}} described in Indonesia. There was no large-scale epidemiological study of {{head and neck}} cancer in Indonesia, especially in Semarang and surrounding areas. Whereas, by knowing the distribution of sex and age in the incidence data could indicate changes in patterns of cancer that occur every year. Aim: This research aim to determine the distribution of head and neck cancer based on anatomic site, age and sex by counting the <b>Age</b> <b>Standardization</b> Rates (ASR) and <b>Age</b> <b>Standardization</b> Cancer Ratio (ASCAR) score Methods : This research was a retrospective observational descriptive study using the medical records of Head and Neck Cancer Patients from Anatomical Pathology Laboratory of Kariadi Central Hospital / Medical Faculty Diponegoro University and Waspada Laboratory in 2010 - 2014. Collected data were tabulated manually using Microsoft Excel and analyzed and presented descriptively in table or graphic form Result: The incidences of head and neck cancer were varies every year. The nasopharyngeal cancer {{seems to be the}} most common head and neck cancer diagnosed during 2010 - 2014. ASCR and ASR in male and female were different in certain head and neck cancer cases. Generally, ASR in male was higher than in females. Conclusion: The trends of head and neck cancer mostly in men. Based on age it distributed mostly in age group 40 - 44. Nasopharyngeal cancer is the most cases diagnosed in this period in both male and female and followed with the neoplasm of nasal cavity and middle ear. <b>Age</b> <b>Standardization</b> used in this research allows this research’s result to be compared with the result in another population which used the same method.

Objective: To analyze the influence of age structure, hospitalization frequency and expenditure structure in health expenditures, for men and women in Northeast and Southeast Regions, in 1998. Methods: The population size was standardizaded and, assuming a population of 10 million people for each sex, the difference in the expenditure, by Region, was compared, fixing each component at a time. A decomposition exercise was done in order to identify the proportion of the difference explained by each component. Results: The expenditure structure, in both sexes, was the component that explained the most, which means that if the expenditure structure difference were eliminated, the total expenditure's differences between the regions would decrease from 32, 6 % to - 0, 39 % for men and from 6, 8 % to - 27, 27 % for women. health, expenditure, <b>age</b> structure, <b>aging,</b> <b>standardization...</b>|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the rationale for}} and implications of {{the implementation of a}} new population standard for the <b>age</b> <b>standardization</b> (age adjustment) of death rates. The new standard is based on the year 2000 population and beginning with data year 1999, will replace the existing standard based on the 1940 population. This report also includes a technical discussion of direct and indirect standardization and statistical variability in age-adjusted death rates. Currently, at least three different standards are used among Department of Health and Human Services agencies. Implementation of the year 2000 standard will reduce confusion among data users and the burden on State and local agencies. Use of the year 2000 standard will also result in age-adjusted death rates that are substantially larger than those based on the 1940 standard. Further, the new standard will affect trends in age-adjusted death rates for certain causes of death and will narrow race differentials in age-adjusted death rates. Although <b>age</b> <b>standardization</b> is an important and useful tool, it has some limitations. As a result the examination of age-adjusted death rates should be the beginning of an analysis strategy. by Robert N. Anderson and Harry M. Rosenberg. 979624...|$|E

Findings: The article indicates that most mainstream educational change theory and practice in the field of educational administration neglects the political, historical, and longitudinal aspects of change to their detriment.

However, the absence of internal standards is also a drawback in manual SPME approaches. Without internal <b>standardization,</b> <b>ageing</b> of the SPME fiber is challenging, as is the variation of the MS performance.

The Swedish Academy was founded in 1786 with the task of caring for Swedish literature and language, including the publication of a grand dictionary. Spelling evolved slowly in the 18th century and was largely based on etymology. Because of its historic relationship to English heart and German Herz, this word was spelled hjerta in Swedish even though it's pronounced [...] The word for woman was spelled qvinna, similar to English queen. The question words hvad, hvar, hvilken had a silent H, like English what, where, which still have. In 1801 the Academy published an official orthography (Carl Gustaf af Leopold, Afhandling om svenska stafsättet, 266 pages). A shorter version for schools was published by Carl Jonas Love Almqvist, Svensk Rättstafnings-Lära in 1829.|$|R
40|$|As {{researchers}} {{increase their}} efforts to characterize variations in the functional connectome across studies and individuals, concerns about the many sources of nuisance variation present {{and their impact on}} resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) measures continue to grow. Although substantial within-site variation can exist efforts to aggregate data across multiple sites such as the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP) and International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (INDI) datasets amplify these concerns. The present work draws upon standardization approaches commonly used in the microarray gene expression literature, {{and to a lesser extent}} recent imaging studies, and compares them with respect to their impact on relationships between common R-fMRI measures and nuisance variables (e. g., imaging site, motion), as well as phenotypic variables of interest (<b>age,</b> sex). <b>Standardization</b> approaches differed with regard to whether they were applied post-hoc vs. during pre-processing, and at the individual vs. group level; additionally they varied in whether they addressed additive effects vs. additive + multiplicative effects, and were parametric vs. non-parametric. While all standardization approaches were effective at reducing undesirable relationships with nuisance variables, post-hoc approaches were generally more effective than global signal regression (GSR). Across approaches, correction for additive effects (global mean) appeared to be more important than for multiplicative effects (global SD) for all R-fMRI measures, with the exception of amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF). Group-level post-hoc standardizations for mean-centering and variance-standardization were found to be advantageous in their ability to avoid the introduction of artifactual relationships with standardization parameters; though results between individual and group-level post-hoc approaches were highly similar overall. While post-hoc standardization procedures drastically increased test-retest (TRT) reliability for ALFF, modest reductions were observed for other measures after post-hoc standardizations a phenomena likely attributable to the separation of voxel-wise from global differences among subjects (global mean and SD demonstrated moderate TRT reliability for these measures). Finally, the present work calls into question previous observations of increased anatomical specificity for GSR over mean centering, and draws attention to the near equivalence of global and gray matter signal regression.
