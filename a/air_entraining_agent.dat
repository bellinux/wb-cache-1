The FI test measures the mass ratio of AEA/binder required to obtain stable foam when shaking a mixture of water, binder powder and AEA, while increasing AEA-dosage stepwise. A review of concrete air entrainment and new studies combining adsorption (TGA, NMR) of AEA on fly ash with various FI test procedures, including time dependent effects on foam stability, are presented. Inter-laboratory correlation between FI and concrete air void content verifies that FI is reliable for assessing compatible binder-admixture combinations. Our adsorption- and FI measurements showed that AEA with detectable adsorption required more AEA to foam than AEA that did not adsorb on the fly ash.

40|$|Roller {{compacted}} concrete (RCC) is a drier consistency concrete proportioned with dense graded aggregates and has lesser paste content. Primarily owing to its drier consistency, the fresh and mechanical performances of RCC are distinctly different from conventional concretes. The objectives {{of this work}} were three fold. The first objective was to explain the anomalous behavior of fresh RCC in terms of different components of workability. The second objective was to explain the mechanisms of strength development in terms of paste quality and quantity. The final objective was to explain the roles of different chemical admixtures (water reducers, retarders, rheology modifiers, <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> <b>agents,</b> dry cast products, etc.) in influencing the workability and strength performances of RCC. It is observed that the relative volume {{and quality of the}} paste, in addition to combined aggregate grading, affect the overall workability of mixtures. The workability of concrete is characterized in terms of cohesion, angle of internal friction, air content, compactibility, and consistency retention over time. Air content plays a decisive role in influencing the performances of concrete. The resulting mobility of the paste influences the compactibility, which in-turn decides the strength as well. RCC shows anomalous behavior in terms of mechanical strength as shown by deviations in the Abrams 2 ̆ 7 law. It is argued that water-binder ratio is not a comprehensive parameter to explain the overall concrete behavior and trends. A significant body of knowledge is added in terms of the use of chemical admixtures in RCC. Atypical behaviors in influencing the fresh and hardened properties are explained by offering plausible mechanisms in terms of binder-admixture interactions.

40|$|Use of roller {{compacted}} concrete (RCC) for pavement applications {{is growing in}} the United States. This material offers great technical and economic benefits, however there is insufficient research done to understand it better. The drier consistency and lack of adequate paste in RCC makes its fresh behavior very different from other types of concretes. This also leads to challenges in characterizing its properties adequately to be translated to practice. The use of chemical admixture in RCC has not been studied in detail before and hence there is an apprehension in using them. What further aggravates {{the problem is the}} use of multiple mixing technologies used in producing RCC. This research attempts to resolve some of these problems. The workability of concrete is considered to be constituted by the cohesion, compactibility, and segregation resistance, retention of workability, water reduction and consistency. Each of these properties was characterized using a test method. These include the use of vibrated slump test, direct shear test as used in soils, and gyratory compaction test as used in asphalt industry. Furthermore, ten most widely used chemical admixtures were tested in a typical RCC mixture. These include water reducers, retarders, <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> <b>agents</b> and dry cast industry products. For each of these product types, different chemical formulations were selected to evaluate the comparative performances. It is observed that individually each admixture offers distinct benefits and improves different properties of fresh RCC including changing the setting behavior and finishibility. Moreover, for a given mixture, the improvement in workability is a composite function of its components viz. cohesion, compactibility, consistency, water reduction, admixture type and dosage. Finally, a set of recommendations are offered along with some precautions to be taken in using these admixtures individually.

The specific goal of this project is to determine the influence of the high pH and dissolved solids content of the wash water on the durability of concrete, particularly with respect to de-icing salt induced corrosion of steel reinforcement. Two types of mix designs were used in this research: a standard class N and a higher strength, structural C 2 concrete. Two sets of concretes specimens were made with both mix designs: one with wash water and one with clean water. The project consists of a multi-component experimental program, beginning with wash water characterization, then pore solution and cement chemistry, followed by an evaluation of the effect of wash water on concrete workability and mechanical properties, resistance to de-icing salt scaling, and corrosion of reinforcing steel embedded in the concrete. In addition, the effect of the wash water on the effectiveness of <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> <b>agents</b> (AEA) is being determined using air void analysis of specimens with different AEA contents. On the basis of the results obtained from the comparative study using wash water versus tap water, it appears that wash water can be used as mixing water for the production of concrete without compromising the durability properties related to corrosion and salt scaling performance. In addition, the mechanical and plastic properties of wash water concrete meet all standards pertaining to the use of wash water concrete and are similar to those of tap water concrete. Finally, the pore solution, thermal analyses, and water analyses of wash water and tap water showed comparable results.

The physical and mechanical properties of mortar containing synthetic cosurfactants as <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> <b>agent</b> are investigated. The cosurfactants consist {{of a combination of}} 2 % dodecyl benzene sodium sulfonate (DBSS) and either 1. 5 % polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or 1. 5 % polyoxyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (POE). Also these cosurfactants were used to prepare copolymers latex: styrene/butyl methacrylate (St/BuMA), styrene/methyl methacrylate (St/MMA), and styrene/glycidyl methacrylate (St/GMA), in order to study their effects on the properties of mortar. The properties of mortar examined included flow table, W/C ratio, setting time, water absorption, compressive strength, and combined water. The results indicate that the latex causes improvement in mortar properties compared with cosurfactants. Also polymer latex containing DBSS/POE is more effective than that containing DBSS/PVA. 1...|$|E

Fractional distillation at atmospheric pressure can concentrate ethanol to 95.6% by weight (89.5 mole%). This mixture is an azeotrope with a boiling point of , and cannot be further purified by distillation. Addition of an <b>entraining</b> <b>agent,</b> such as benzene, cyclohexane, or heptane, allows a new ternary azeotrope comprising the ethanol, water, and the <b>entraining</b> <b>agent</b> to be formed. This lower-boiling ternary azeotrope is removed preferentially, leading to water-free ethanol.|$|R

Izvajali smo preizkuse tlačnih trdnosti betona in preizkuse mrazoobstojnosti. V seriji vzorcev smo uporabili aerant in med seboj primerjali dobljene rezultate vzorcev brez aeranta in vzorce z dodatkom aeranta. Uporaba elektrofiltrskega pepela in reciklirane gume v betonski mešanici je predstavljena kot možnost ponovne uporabe odpadnih materialov. In thesis {{entitled}} »Use {{of concrete}} mixtures with recycled rubber particles and fly ash additions« is presented using of cocnrete, {{which was the}} part of binder replaced by fly ash, part of the aggregate was replaced by recycled rubber. We made tests of compressive strenght and freez/thaw resistance. In a series of samples we used the <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> and compared results obtainined without <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> samples and samples with the <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> additons.
