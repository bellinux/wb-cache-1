Improper finishing and polishing of cast framework will adversely affect {{the quality of}} functional units of partial dentures due to reduced dimensions. In this study the polished surface characteristic and loss of weight of the casting were evaluated and compared following different finishing and polishing techniques. A total number of thirty test specimens were cast and each surface finishing and polishing technique was carried out with a high speed polishing motor and an electropolishing unit under standardised conditions. Surface roughness was evaluated by means of a surface roughness analyzing instrument, Perthometer. The loss of weight due to the metal lost was observed on a sensitive electronic balance. The results of polishing technique employed with G 3 group revealed better surface characteristic. It may be understood that sandblasting causes initial roughness and the sequence of coarse cylindrical abrasive, Black hard rubber polisher (coarse grit-Dentauram), Grey hard rubber polisher (Med-grit-Dentauram), Green hard rubber polisher (Fine-grit-Dentauram), Grey flexible rubber polisher (Fine grit-Renfert), felt buff with pumice slurry and felt buff with green polishing compound (Degussa) produced improved surface in this case. The loss of weight due to metal lost show concern with technique groups G 4, G 5, G 6. It can be avoided by judicious sandblasting and application of proper grit of <b>abrasive</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R
40|$|Addressing {{the risks}} of {{nanoparticles}} requires knowledge about release into the environment and occupational exposure. However, such information currently is not systematically collected; therefore, this risk assessment lacks quantitative data. The goal was to evaluate {{the current level of}} nanoparticle usage in Swiss industry as well as health, safety, and environmental measures, and the number of potentially exposed workers. A representative, stratified mail survey was conducted among 1626 clients of the Swiss National Accident Insurance Fund (SUVA), which insures 80, 000 manufacturing firms, representing 84 % of all Swiss manufacturing companies (947 companies answered the survey for a 58. 3 % response rate). The extrapolation to all Swiss manufacturing companies results in 1309 workers (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1073 to 1545) potentially exposed to nanoparticles in 586 companies (95 % CI: 145 to 1027). This corresponds to 0. 08 % of workers (95 % CI: 0. 06 % to 0. 09 %) and to 0. 6 % of companies (95 % CI: 0. 2 % to 1. 1 %). The industrial chemistry sector showed the highest percentage of companies using nanoparticles (21. 2 %). Other important sectors also reported nanoparticles. Personal protection equipment was the predominant protection strategy. Only a few applied specific environmental protection measures. This is the first nationwide representative study on nanoparticle use in the manufacturing sector. The information gained can be used for quantitative risk assessment. It can also help policymakers design strategies to support companies developing a safer use of nanomaterial. Notingthe current low use of nanoparticles, there is still time to proactively introduce protective methods. If the predicted "nano-revolution" comes true, {{now is the time to}} take action.

The geometry and arrangement of the barbs, together with the keratin and pigments deposited in the feathers, determine the mechanical stability of the vane, and its stiffness and resistance to <b>abrasive</b> <b>agents.</b> In colour-polymorphic species, individuals display alternative colour morphs, which can be associated with different foraging strategies. Each morph may therefore require specific flying abilities, and their feathers may be exposed to different <b>abrasive</b> <b>agents.</b> Feathers of differently coloured individuals may thus have a specific structure, and colour pigments may help resist <b>abrasive</b> <b>agents</b> and improve stiffness. We examined these predictions in the barn owl (Tyto alba), a species for which the ventral body side varies from white to dark reddish pheomelanic, and in the number and size of black spots located at the tip of the feathers. White and reddish birds show different foraging strategies, and the size of black feather spots is associated with several phenotypic attributes. We found that birds displaying a darker reddish coloration on the ventral body side deposit more melanin pigments in their remiges, which also have fewer barbs. This suggests that wear resistance increases with darkness, whereas feathers of lighter coloured birds may bend less easily. Accordingly, individuals displaying a lighter reddish coloration on the ventral body side, and those displaying larger black spots, displayed more black transverse bars on their remiges: as larger-spotted individuals are heavier and longer-winged birds also have more transverse bars, these bars may reduce feather bending when flying. We conclude that differently coloured individuals produce wing feathers of different strengths to adopt alternative behavioural and life history strategie...|$|R

Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the surface effects of aluminum trihydroxide airpolishing powder on a series of restorative materials. Materials and Methods: A total of 6 Class V preparations with enamel margins were created on the buccal surface of extracted human molars. The preparations were restored with Type III gold, a high copper spherical alloy amalgam, porcelain, a lightactivated hybrid composite material, a light-activated microfilled composite material, and a light-activated, resin-modified glass ionomer material. The distal half of each restoration was covered with fiberglass tape and the mesial half subjected to treatment with the aluminum trihydroxide powder via the Prophy-Jet™ for 5 seconds. After removal of the protective tape, the buccal surface of each treated tooth was replicated with impression material. Replicas were generated using epoxy resin and prepared for evaluation with scanning electron microscopy. Results: The aluminum trihydroxide produced surface alterations that were apparent visually and when viewed by a scanning microscope of the hybrid and microfilled composites and the glass ionomer restorations. The surfaces of the amalgam and gold restorations were altered, but not to the extent that the resin-based materials were. No disruption of the surface characterization of the porcelain was detected; however, with gold and porcelain materials, the aluminum trihydroxide removed notable amounts of the luting cements (the results are consistent with the data gathered with sodium bicarbonate powder). Conclusion: Aluminum trihydroxide as the <b>abrasive</b> <b>agent</b> in an airpolishing system should be avoided on resin composites, resin-modified composites, and around the margins of cemented restorations...|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of nanotechnology {{has led to}} a rise in the large-scale production and commercial use of engineered nano-ZnO. Engineered/manufactured nano-ZnO are applied in a broad range of products such as drugs, paints, cosmetics, <b>abrasive</b> <b>agents</b> and insulators. This can result in the unintended exposure of human beings to nano-ZnO and will inevitably result in the release of nano-ZnO in to the environment. Thus, it is necessary to assess the risk of nano-ZnO to the environment. In this thesis the toxicity of nano-ZnO was analysed using the aquatic, primary producer lesser duckweed (Lemna minor), and the mechanism of toxicity was analysed. Both short-term (one week) and long-term (six weeks) toxicity of nano-ZnO (uncoated) were determined. Results show that the toxicity of nano-ZnO added to the aquatic growth medium increases with increasing concentration and that toxicity accumulates with exposure time. A study of nano-ZnO dissolution reveals that the main reason for nano-ZnO toxicity on Lemna minor is the release of Zn ions. Nano-ZnO dissolution is pH dependent, and toxicity matches the release of Zn 2 +. Functional coating materials are commonly added to nano-ZnO particles to improve specific industrial applications. To test if coating materials contribute to nano-ZnO toxicity on lesser duckweed, the effect of silane coupling agent (KH 550) coated nano-ZnO on Lemma minor was investigated. Results show that coating can decrease the release of Zn ions, which reduces toxicity to Lemna minor, in contrast to uncoated particles. Another commonly hypothesized reason for nano-ZnO toxicity is the formation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) on the particles surface. As part of this thesis, the ROS formation induced by nano-ZnO was studied. Results show that nano-ZnO catalyse ROS formation and this can negatively affect duckweed growth. In conclusion, this work has detailed potentially toxic effects of nano-ZnO on Lemna minor. This study has also provides references for future research, and informs regulatory testing for nanoparticle toxicity. Specifically, the outcomes of this study emphasize the importance of exposure time, environmental parameters and coating material when analysing NPs toxicity. Firstly, impacts of longer exposure time should be studied. Secondly, environmental parameters such as pH and medium-composition need to be considered when investigating NPs toxicity. Lastly, coating of NPs should always be considered in the context of NPs toxicity, and similar NPs with different coatings require separate toxicity tests...|$|R

During some of these tests, aqueous aluminum oxide suspensions were used as <b>abrasive</b> <b>agent</b> either diluted or not in distilled water. In case of the ball-on-plate test wear is dominated by abrasive and/or adhesive mechanisms, and is characterized by scratches which are composed of wear defects comprising particle detachment, wear of the polymer matrix and ceramic particle abrasion.

In case of the pin-on-plate test wear is governed by the fatigue mechanism, although abrasive and adhesive wear mechanism are also present. After a certain number of cycles fatigue wear dominates the wear behavior and results in severe material loss. This mechanism seems to be more important in case of more brittle materials and when higher loads are employed.

Despite of all the positive attributes conferred by this technique, it is a complex process which could last up to years and is affected by several variables of different nature and complexities. This process has several economic impacts representing large investments for all producers to store the wines in cellars as well as the wine maker has to bear the potential risk associated with the organoleptic and microbiological alterations in the wines. Thus, {{it is important for the}} winemakers to optimize the time of ageing on lees. Further more in today’s fiercely competitive market it is reasonable to develop new strategies and techniques to accelerate the ageing over lees process, shorten the storage time and achieve better quality. In this study two novel techniques: use of non Saccharomyces strains coupled with ultrasound treatment were tested to see their efficiency for accelerating aging over lees. The combined effects of the techniques were tested to see their impacts on the polysaccharide release and on the organoleptic properties of red wine. Release of polysaccharides was analyzed by HPLC-RI. Anthocyanins and aroma compounds were analyzed by using HPLC-PDAD/ESI-MS, GC-FID respectively. Also Color and Total Phenolic Index were recorded periodically along the experiment. Results showed that ultrasound treatment is a reliable technique for shortening the ageing on lees process by strongly increasing the concentration of polysaccharides released into the wine after only two weeks treatment and without adversely affecting the sensorial quality of the wine. Additions of sand as an <b>abrasives</b> <b>agent</b> increased the polysaccharide release. Furthermore the non Saccharomyces strains of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomyces ludwigii and Brettanomyces showed better results with regards to the amount of polysaccharide release compared to the control Saccharomyces strains. Interesting results with Brettanomyces were observed, as the use of this particular strain did not impart any off flavors to the wine. This can be explained by the use of lyophilized strains used in this study which were dosed in the wine to carry out the aging over lees. Ultrasonic treatment coupled with aging over lees resulted in reduction of anthocyanin content of the wine and also effected the aroma compounds. In conclusion this study illustrated the use of Ultrasounds and Non Saccharomyces strains as novel techniques for aging over lees, however more research in this field is required to study the clear effects on ultrasounds on the chemical composition of wine before replicating the application on a large scale productio...|$|R

The circulation of the blasting medium becomes the integrating factor of the process line, starting from the hopper, through the propeller turbine, casting treatment, separation of contaminated abrasive mixture, to its recycling and reuse. Inferior quality of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>agent</b> (shot) and insufficient purity of the abrasive mixture are responsible for low effectiveness of shot blasting. However, most practitioners fail to fully recognise the importance of proper diagnostics of the shot blasting process in industrial conditions. The wearing of major machine components and of the blasting agent and quality of shot treated surfaces are often misinterpreted, hence the need to take into account all factors involved in the process within the frame of a comprehensive methodology. This paper is an attempt to formulate and apply the available testing methods to the engineering practice in industrial conditions...|$|E
40|$|Two {{field studies}} in the Mojave Desert, California, shed light on {{processes}} of ventifact formation. The field sites are located on a ridge at Little Cowhole Mountain, which lies approximately 12 km south of Baker, and on an unnamed ridge situated along the northern boundary of the Mojave River Sink (Rasor Road site). The rocks at Little Cowhole Mountain are a blue-grey marble/dolomite, whereas those at Rasor Road are Miocene volcanic rocks (basalt). At both sites the <b>abrasive</b> <b>agent</b> is a fine-grained aeolian sand which was probably derived largely from the Mojave River. There are minimal modem inputs of sand to either site: abrasion {{occurs as a result}} of unique climatic and topographic conditions which allow pre-existing sand to be recycled from one aspect of the ridge to the other. Climatic conditions are well suited for ventifact formation. Owing, to the dry climate (marked by low average relative humidity, infrequent dew, and low annual rainfall), rates of chemical weathering are low. Where resurfacing of the rocks by sand abrasion proceeds at a rate greater than weathering, the ventifacts are considered "active. " Active ventifacts are found atop and straddling the ridge crests, in the zone of maximum wind velocity and sediment supply. Inactive ventifacts occur where modem weathering Processes exceed abrasion rates; principally on the basal two-thirds of the hillslope, where wind velocity and sediment supply are lower. At intermediate locations between the slope base and crest, ventifacts are either active or inactive, depending on local conditions. The presence of relict ventifacts at the study sites, as well as elsewhere in the eastern Mojave Desert, suggests that the conditions for venti fact formation must have been more intense and extensive in the past. Together, the studies illustrate that the processes that interact to form ventifacts are highly complex, and must be studied at many scales. Small-scale effects, such as local topography, plant cover, or even the spatial distribution of boulders, strongly influence the formation of each individual ventifact. Mesoscale effects (hillslope form, total availability of sediment, seasonality of winds, etc.) determine the distribution of overall erosional energy and the location of active and relict forms...|$|E

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Whitening dentifrices use {{different}} mechanisms for stain removal and prevention. These approaches are <b>abrasives,</b> oxidizing <b>agents,</b> and chemical cleaning agents. The objectives of this in-vitro study were: 1) To compare the whitening effect of commercial whitening and non-whitening dentifrices; 2) To verify {{the mechanism of}} action of whitening dentifrices by contrasting two experimental models: chemical model (toothpaste exposure only) and chemo-mechanical (toothpaste exposure with tooth-brushing abrasion). The 256 bovine enamel specimens (10 mm x 10 mm) were prepared and partially stained. They were assigned to 8 groups: 6 whitening dentifrices, 1 non-whitening reference dentifrice and deionized water (control); and they were further divided in 2 subgroups (n = 16), chemical and chemo-mechanical. Specimens were exposed to dentifrice slurries 2 X/day for 1 min and brushed or not, according to each model. In between dentifrice treatments, specimens {{were exposed to the}} staining solution for 5 h. This protocol was repeated for 5 consecutive days and enamel color changes (∆E, ∆L) were measured by spectrophotometry after each day. The abrasivity of the toothpastes was determined using a standard test (ISO 11609). Significantly higher ∆E values (whitening effect) were observed for all groups (p 0. 05). Whitening dentifrices can be effective in preventing and removing enamel surface staining, when associated with tooth-brushing abrasion. This was modulated by the abrasive level of the tested toothpastes, with no chemical action attributed to the chemical agents. indefinitel...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn modern {{industries}} with {{advancement of}} technology advanced engineering materials {{are needed to}} be used like Tungsten, Titanium alloys, ceramics, various composites etc. These materials possess some special characteristics such as high hardness, high wear resistance, high toughness, high strength etc. which make them preferred over conventional materials in modern industries. Due to the stringent properties these materials are difficult to process. Different conventional finishing processes like grinding, lapping, honing, buffing etc. are generally inefficient in finishing these materials. Although processes like abrasive flow machining, magnetic field assisted finishing processes and chemo-mechanical finishing may be used but these may be less productive. Therefore a new process which uses combination of chemical oxidation and magnetic field assisted abrasion (magnetic abrasive finishing) has been conceived in the present work for faster processing. To establish the process experiments have been conducted on tungsten work piece {{and the effects of}} various process parameters like percentage weight of <b>abrasive,</b> oxidizing <b>agent</b> concentration, rotational speed of magnet and working gap on process response namely percentage change in average surface roughness value (ΔRa) was recorded. The experiments were planned using Taguchi L 9 orthogonal array. Experimental data was analyzed using analysis of variance to understand contribution of various process factors on process response. SEM micrographs have also been obtained to study the surface morphology of the finished work piece. Regression model was developed to predict the percentage change in surface roughness in terms of significant process factors...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis [...] In {{addition}} to the usual physical and chemical laboratory tests applied to cleansing toothpastes, analyses for the water-soluble anticaries species are required for evaluation of an anticaries toothpaste. Methods to determine stannous and fluoride ions in the toothpaste are described and discussed. Toothpaste formulations containing anticaries agents should have all the characteristics, such as cleansing action, feel, and flavor, desired in a toothpaste which has good consumer acceptability. In ad-dition, the <b>abrasive</b> and other <b>agents</b> present in the formulation and the tube must be compatible with the anticaries agent. In order to achieve these aims, knowledge of the physical and chemical character-istics of the anticaries agent is required. Specific analytical procedures for the agent and the products of its decomposition are necessary to de-fine its stability {{in the presence of}} the other ingredients in the formula-tion. A thorough knowledge of the anticaries agent should be coupled with comparable information and analytical procedures for the other ingredients in the formulation, such as abrasives, humectants, binders, and foaming and flavoring agents. Complete information on available toothpaste ingredients and the anticaries agent should result in the selection of a combination of components to give the best over-all prod-uct...|$|R
