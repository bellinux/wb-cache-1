40|$|To {{continuous}} {{workings of}} computer, we suggest <b>a</b> mechanism <b>of</b> <b>exchanging</b> <b>a</b> part <b>of</b> program, while {{the program is}} executed. First, we show the conditions to <b>exchange</b> <b>a</b> part <b>of</b> program. Second, we describe our mechanism <b>of</b> <b>exchanging</b> <b>a</b> part <b>of</b> program and provide a thread control method to reduce a bad effect for services. Third, we formulate <b>an</b> average time <b>of</b> <b>exchanging</b> <b>a</b> part <b>of</b> program, then estimate elapsed times <b>of</b> <b>exchanging</b> <b>an</b> application program part in some cases. Finally, we implement trial model for example, and estimate that. The results show this mechanism makes possible to maintain software with running computer service, and the influence to service provide is small...|$|R

He was the elder son of Ernest III, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and his first wife Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.

5|$|Having {{dealt with}} the {{pressure}} from the Magyars and the Byzantines, Simeon was free to plan a campaign against the Magyars looking for retribution. He negotiated a joint force with the Magyars' eastern neighbours, the Pechenegs, and imprisoned the Byzantine envoy Leo Choirosphaktes in order to delay {{the release of the}} captives until after the campaign against the Magyars. This would allow him to renegotiate the peace conditions in his favour. In <b>an</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> letters with the envoy, Simeon refused to release the captives and ridiculed Leo VI's astrological abilities.|$|E

5|$|No Major League Baseball (MLB) {{team had}} played in Cuba since March 21, 1959. Castro made {{attempts}} to lure American baseball teams back to Cuba to no avail. In the 1970s, George McGovern, a United States Senator, pushed the idea of <b>an</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> MLB and college basketball teams {{as a way to}} bridge the impasse between the two governments, similar to the ping-pong diplomacy that aided US-China relations; however, this was blocked by the United States Department of State.|$|E

30|$|Each role in <b>an</b> <b>exchange</b> {{includes}} {{one or more}} moves, {{that are}} realized in grammar by a major or minor clause (Martin, 1992; Martin & Rose, 2007).

5|$|The Internet is a {{worldwide}} network {{of computers and}} computer networks that {{communicate with each other}} using the Internet Protocol. Any computer on the Internet has a unique IP address that can be used by other computers to route information to it. Hence, any computer on the Internet can send a message to any other computer using its IP address. These messages carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus <b>an</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> messages between computers.|$|E

5|$|The time in Arles {{became one}} of Van Gogh's more {{prolific}} periods: he completed 200 paintings, and more than 100 drawings and watercolours. He was enchanted by the local landscape and light; his works from this period are rich in yellow, ultramarine and mauve. His paintings include harvests, wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area, including The Old Mill (1888), a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields. This was one of seven canvases sent to Pont-Aven on 4 October 1888 in <b>an</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> works with Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard, Charles Laval and others.|$|E
