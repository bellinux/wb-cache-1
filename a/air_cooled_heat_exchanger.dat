Wind energy is well recognized as the nearest commercialized renewable energy technologies besides the water resource, it has high priority by governments, is developing rapidly worldwide. In the field of wind power, single megawatt wind power unit is becoming the mainstream of technology development and market demand [1]. On the one hand it is needed to optimize the generator structure to reduce heat generation [2], more importantly, efficient cooling system is needed to protect the generator [3]. Air-water cooled and air-air cooled are the main cooling mode for wind power generator coolers.

40|$|Advancements in {{electronics}} {{have created}} the need for improved cooling standards. The AECM standard, created to replace the antiquated ARINC 600 specification for aircraft, draws inspiration from a cooling specification known as VITA 48. 2. The ARINC standard is in early stages of development and this project researches the feasibility of using air as a convective fluid instead of a liquid, the fluid used in the VITA specification. A performance factor calculated from {{the ratio of the}} heat dissipated by convective heat exchanger plates over the power used to cause forced convective flow over said plates helps to quantify the effectiveness of various cooling scenarios. Design development of the heat exchangers resulted in a plan to manufacture and test six different heat exchanger configurations. Five of these used various assortments of porous foam aluminum; the sixth used a more conventional finned design. To house and test the effectiveness of these configurations a testing platform was created to control and measure appropriate testing values. Before each configuration was tested, the setup was sealed to prevent leaks and insulated to minimize heat transfer sources beyond the effects of the controlled and measured convective air. Notable results include a 10 ppi, 8 % density porous aluminum foam heat exchanger which resulted in both the largest pressure drop, 2. 7 inches of water and heat dissipated at 301 watts at a flow rate of 72 CFM. The performance factor of this plate was the lowest at 13 [Watts/Watts]. Conversely, the largest performance factor at similar flow rate was seen in the finned plate design as 58 [Watts/Watts] at 71 CFM. However, its heat transfer for this flow rate was 167 Watts. Test results and analysis for each prototype is given within the report. A general plot of the results provides a valuable selection tool for choosing an appropriate starting design point to develop AECM air cooling for Boeing. The heat dissipation seen from the <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> plates is competitive with the liquid cooled module plates and deserves further investigation. The added benefits of natural convection and the weight savings of air cooling further endorse this conclusion...|$|E

40|$|Heat {{exchangers}} are {{equipment that}} transfers heat from one medium to another. An <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> or ACHE, {{is simply a}} pressure vessel which cools a circulating fluid within finned tubes by forcing ambient air over {{the exterior of the}} tubes. In cross flow exchangers, the hot and cold fluids move perpendicular to each other. Some actual heat exchangers are a mixture of cross flow and counter flow (Known as Counter to Cross Flow Heat Exchangers) due to design features. The proper design, operation and maintenance of heat exchangers will make the process energy efficient and minimize energy losses. Heat exchanger performance can deteriorate with time, off design operations and other interferences such as fouling, scaling etc. It is necessary to assess periodically the heat exchanger performance in order to maintain them at a high efficiency level. This section comprises certain proven techniques of monitoring the performance of heat exchangers, coolers and condensers from observed operating data of the equipment. A major problem constantly faced by heat exchanger designers is to predict accurately the performance of a given heat exchanger or a system of heat exchangers for a given set of service conditions. The problem is {{complicated by the fact that}} uncertainties exist in most of the design parameters and in the design procedures themselves. The design parameters that are used in the basic thermal design calculations of a heat exchanger include process parameters, heat-transfer coefficients, tube dimensions (e. g., tube diameter, wall thickness), thermal conductivity of the tube material, and thermo physical properties of the fluids. Nominal or mean values of these parameters are used in the design calculations. However, uncertainties in these parameters prevent us from predicting the exact performance of the unit. The effect of the uncertainties is mostly in the performance degradation in service. Hence, there is an imperative need to consider all the uncertainties and to critically evaluate them and correctly predict the thermal performance of a heat exchanger. This is particularly true for critical applications. In thermal design of heat exchangers there are presently many stages in which assumptions in mathematical solution of the design problem are being made. Accumulation of these assumptions (e. g. use of mean values) may introduce variations in design as large as the uncertainties introduced in heat-transfer and flow friction correlations. The designer needs to understand where these inaccuracies may arise, and strive to eliminate as many sources of error as possible by choosing design configurations that avoid such problems at source.

40|$|Air {{or water}} cooled heat {{exchangers}} (HX) are typically utilized as condensers or coolers for air-conditioning, refrigeration or process cooling applications in both {{commercial and industrial}} sector. However, <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> performance degrades considerably with rise in ambient air temperature and water cooled coolers require considerable pumping power, a cooling tower and may consume {{a significant amount of}} water which may come from fresh water sources. Evaporative cooling offers a unique solution to this problem, where a small amount of wetting water evaporates on HX surface to boost performance in high ambient air temperature conditions. In this study, several evaporative cooling technologies were applied to three wavy-fin HXs to quantify capacity enhancement ratio (CER) and air-side pressure drop penalty ratio (PR&# 916;Pa) compared to respective dry case baseline values. Effect of varying wetting water flow rate, air velocity, fin spacing, hydrophilic coatings, spray orientation and inlet air temperature and relative humidity was investigated on hybrid heat exchanger performance. Several new performance comparison parameters were defined to compare different evaporative cooling approaches. Deluge cooling achieved overall highest CER but at a PR&# 916;Pa that was similar in magnitude to the CER. This limitation was found to be inherent to the nature of wetting water distribution method itself. Although front spray cooling tests indicated PR&# 916;Pa~ 1, front spray evaporative cooling technology was found to have up to 23 - 75 % lower CER at 60 - 100 % lower PR&# 916;Pa compared to deluge cooling. In order to understand the wetting behavior a novel visualization method was proposed and implemented, which consisted of borescope assisted flow mapping of water distribution within the HX core as a function of air velocities and wetting water flow rates. It was found that up to 85 % of HX volume remained dry during front spray cooling which accounted for lower capacity enhancement and deluge cooling forms non-uniform and thick water film which causes bridging and increased PR&# 916;Pa, A larger component level testing with HX size similar to commercial units allowed to identify constraints of different evaporative cooling methods, which would not be possible if tests were performed at a smaller segment or fin level. A novel spray cooling technology utilizing internal jet spray cooling within HX volume was both proposed and implemented and a provisional patent # 61 / 782, 825 was obtained. Compared to front spray cooling at a given spray rate, internal spray cooling could either achieve up to 35 % higher HX cooler capacity, or obtain same HX cooler capacity at approximately three times lower air-side pressure drop. Alternatively, at same air-side pressure drop wetting water savings of up to 68 - 97 % are achieved. Internal spraying combines advantages of conventional technologies and overcomes the drawbacks, by getting CER of approx. 3. 8, without film carryover and at PR&# 916;Pa= 1, while getting maximum wetting uniformity. Intermittent cooling combined with internal spraying could reduce water consumption as evaporative cooling sustains though the brief period when spray is turned off. Thus, potential for significant energy and water savings, targeted cooling, and retrofit design offers significant commercialization opportunity for future hybrid evaporative coolers. Discussions are underway for the inclusion of this technology into product line up of a leading HX manufacturing company...|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. Dry <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> form a {{vital part}} of {{industrial}} heat transfer systems, especially in countries where the supply and availability of clean cooling water is limited. Headerboxes are rectangular pressure vessels that act as the inlet distribution and outlet collection devices. As rectangular pressure vessels, headerboxes are subject to design codes such as ASME (ASME Section VIII, Division 1, 2007). Unfortunately ASME (ASME Section VIII, Division 1, 2007) offers no guidance on how to allow for the effect of external loads applied to the headerbox through the vessel’s nozzles. This creates a difficult situation, since vessel designers are mandated by ASME to consider the effects of nozzle loads by American Petroleum Institute standard 661 (API, 2006). The aim of this project was therefore to develop a closed form design methodology that accurately predicts the stresses inside a headerbox that is subject to external loadings as well as internal pressure. After extensive research it was decided that the only viable approach would be to extend ASME’s rigid frame theory. This was done, and a new set of equations describing the stress distribution inside a headerbox were derived. These equations were then tested using 2 D Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to determine whether they represented the reality of the 2 D model they described. It was found that the equations were accurate enough in 2 D and {{the next step was to}} test the model experimentally and using full 3 D FEA. A local manufacturer of <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> was approached and they helped design an experimental specimen and agreed to fund its construction. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, it was not possible to build and test the specimen experimentally. The specimen geometry was then analysed using the Abaqus (Dassault Systѐmes Simulia Corp., 2010) FEA package. The 3 D FEA analysis considered several different load cases. After carefully analysing the results it was seen that the rigid frame model could make useful qualitative statements about the effects of the nozzle loads, but it performed poorly as a quantitative prediction method. However, since the effects of the nozzle loads are generally quite small it is possible that, with appropriate safety factors, the rigid frame model could be used as a conservative design methodology. The usefulness of a commonly used empirical guideline was also examined. This project is far from conclusive and much more work is required to fully examine the usefulness of rigid frame theory. That being said, this project has made important steps towards a more complete understanding of rectangular pressure vessels and has shown possible ways forward...|$|R

This has triggered the need to optimise existing air-cooled condenser technology, which is currently extremely inefficient. This paper aims to investigate the influence of various fan parameters {{on the performance of}} a cross-flow <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> The study first focuses on the effect of varying the distance between the fan and the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> in order to establish if uniform airflow distributions can be achieved with acceptable axial spacing between the fan and the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> This was achieved by mapping the velocity field at the outlet from the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> by means of a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) analysis. The analysis was carried out for two air flow scenarios; the fan mounted at the inlet to the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> (forced draught) and the fan mounted at the outlet of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> (induced draught). An investigation into the effect of fan speed on velocity distribution was also carried out. The measurements which are presented show that uniform velocity distributions can be achieved with relatively small fan to <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> spacing for the case of the induced draught, whilst for the forced draft, although increasing the fan to <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> spacing resulted in increased flow uniformity, the flow was still highly non uniform at fan to <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> spacing of up to 1. 4 times the fan tip radius. The measurements also showed little effect of fan speed on normalised velocity distribution. Combining the fore mentioned measurements with an analytical calculation technique, the heat flux per unit area across the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> was calculated. The results highlight the limitations on heat transfer in various regions of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> in both flow scenarios. These measurements and calculations will facilitate designers of <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> in achieving the minimum fan to <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> spacing which gives no further increase in total heat transfer.

If cooling water is available it is used as much as needed and then pumped back to the river, some degrees warmer...|$|R
40|$|A {{test system}} for a hybrid <b>cooled</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> was designed, and the test {{facility}} was constructed based on ASHRAE Standard 41. 2 - 1987. A conventional air-cooled tube-fin <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> was tested with and without application of wetting water. The baseline tests were conducted to investigate the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> performance improvement by applying evaporative <b>cooling</b> technology. The <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> capacity and air side pressure drop were measured while varying operating conditions and <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> inclination angles. The results show the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> capacity increased by 170 % with application of the hybrid cooling technology, but the air side pressure drop increased by 130 %. Additional research investigating air fan power was also conducted, which increased 120 % from the dry condition to the hybrid cooled condition. In summary, the potential for improving the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> performance by applying hybrid cooling is shown in this research...|$|R
