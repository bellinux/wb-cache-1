5|$|In 2011, Petersen Rock Garden {{was named}} one of Oregon's Most Endangered Places by the Historic Preservation League of Oregon (now known as Restore Oregon). In 2012, <b>accidental</b> <b>damage</b> {{to one of the}} stone bridges by a {{contractor}} catalyzed an effort to document the garden using laser scanning and other technologies. The garden was closed temporarily in 2013 to undergo repair and review for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Petersen has been praised for his creative work, and the garden has received a positive reception for its uniqueness and local significance. Listing on the National Register was achieved on October 30, 2013.|$|E
25|$|The tin(II) {{chloride}} {{is applied}} because silver will not {{bond with the}} glass. The activator causes the tin/silver to harden. Copper is added for long-term durability.

50|$|A CPU shim (also called CPU spacer) is a shim used {{between the}} CPU {{and the heat}} sink in a computer. Shims make it easier and less risky to mount a {{heatsink}} on the processor because it stabilizes the heatsink, preventing <b>accidental</b> <b>damaging</b> of the fragile CPU packaging. They help distribute weight evenly over the surface.|$|R
30|$|From an {{implementation}} perspective, providing {{small cell}} backhaul at street levels is more challenging and expensive than providing macrocell backhauling at rooftops. This {{is because it}} is difficult to reach street levels using inexpensive LOS links. Deploying backhauling at street levels also requires backhaul equipment which has to be compact and secure to avoid <b>accidental</b> <b>damages</b> and tampering as well as to ease the deployment.|$|R

25|$|Mirrors are {{manufactured}} by applying a reflective coating to a suitable substrate. The most common substrate is glass, {{due to its}} transparency, ease of fabrication, rigidity, hardness, and ability to take a smooth finish. The reflective coating is typically applied to the back surface of the glass, so that the reflecting side of the coating is protected from corrosion and <b>accidental</b> <b>damage</b> by the glass {{on one side and}} the coating itself and optional paint for further protection on the other.|$|E
25|$|Since {{its initial}} discovery, {{the wreck of}} Titanic has been {{revisited}} on numerous occasions by explorers, scientists, filmmakers, tourists and salvagers, who have recovered thousands of items from the debris field for conservation and public display. The ship's condition has deteriorated significantly over the years, particularly from <b>accidental</b> <b>damage</b> by submersibles but mostly because of an accelerating {{rate of growth of}} iron-eating bacteria on the hull. It has been estimated that within the next 50 years the hull and structure of Titanic will eventually collapse entirely, leaving only the more durable interior fittings of the ship intermingled with a pile of rust on the sea floor.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of freight shipments between the EU, Russia and the Asian Pacific Region currently go by sea via the Suez Canal – a distance of between 17,000 and 22,000km. By extending the broad-gauge line, the promoters of the Košice–Vienna project aim to make the Trans-Siberian Railway more competitive vis-à-vis the sea routes. By eliminating the need to change bogies, freight delivery times from East Asia to Europe will be cut by 14 days to just half of the time required for transportation by sea. And as {{there will be no}} freight transshipment the risk of <b>accidental</b> <b>damage</b> to cargo could be reduced. Russian Railways CEO Vladimir Yakunin believes it is the faster freight delivery that will make the project competitive.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, that same {{geographical}} isolation and harsh environment frequently makes archaeological fieldwork both expensive and physically challenging. In modern times, both {{these factors are}} however rapidly changing. New technology and improved infrastructure has allowed easier access for researchers, which has also put many historical remains at risk due to <b>accidental</b> <b>damages</b> caused by tourists, and rapid climate change - with a new, warmer, more humid environment - likewise poses large risks.|$|R
500|$|The engines drove either two {{or three}} screw propellers. France and Germany {{preferred}} the three-screw approach, which allowed the engines to be shorter and hence more easily protected; they were also more maneuverable and had better resistance to <b>accidental</b> <b>damage.</b> Triple screws were, however, generally larger and heavier than the twin-screw arrangements preferred by most other navies. The French also built the only class of turbine powered pre-dreadnought battleships, the [...] of 1907.|$|E
2500|$|Vandalism of art {{refers to}} {{intentional}} damage of an artwork (for unintentional damage see <b>accidental</b> <b>damage</b> of art).

[...] This may distinguish it from [...] art destruction and iconoclasm, where it may be wholly destroyed and removed, and art theft, or looting.|$|E
2500|$|Every time {{an object}} is handled, {{it is at}} risk for damage. [...] Although high {{standards}} for general housing and for packing help eliminate direct handling and decrease chances of damage due to contact, some routine activities such as cataloging and housekeeping will often require work with collection objects.

2500|$|Gillespie's {{trademark}} trumpet {{featured a}} bell which bent upward at a 45-degree angle rather than pointing straight ahead {{as in the}} conventional design. According to Gillespie's autobiography, this was originally the result of <b>accidental</b> <b>damage</b> caused by the dancers Stump and Stumpy falling onto the instrument while {{it was on a}} trumpet stand on stage at Snookie's in Manhattan on January 6, 1953, during a birthday party for Gillespie's wife Lorraine. The constriction caused by the bending altered the tone of the instrument, and Gillespie liked the effect. He had the trumpet straightened out the next day, but he could not forget the tone. Gillespie sent a request to Martin to make him a [...] "bent" [...] trumpet from a sketch produced by Lorraine, and from that time forward played a trumpet with an upturned bell.|$|E
2500|$|In the future, {{humanity}} uses {{time travel}} to construct Eternity, an organization [...] "outside time" [...] which aimed to improve human happiness by observing human history and, after careful analysis, directly making small actions that cause [...] "reality changes", {{as well as}} to help establish trade between the various centuries to help those in most need. Its members, known as [...] "Eternals" [...] and by the roles they hold, prioritize the reduction of human suffering, at the cost of a loss to technology, art and other endeavors which are prevented from existing when judged to have a detrimental effect. Those enlisted travel [...] "upwhen" [...] and [...] "downwhen" [...] and re-enter time in devices called [...] "kettles". Their rules prevent them from earlier travel to the Primitive times before the 27th century, when the temporal field powering Eternity was established, to prevent <b>accidental</b> <b>damage</b> to pre-temporal history. Also, humanity's fate is unknown - the earth is empty by the 125,000th century, but this is preceded by a period called the Hidden Centuries from the 70,000th to 125,000th centuries in which for unknown reasons they cannot access the world outside Eternity to learn more.|$|E

50|$|Growing on a {{horticulture}} trellis increases plant density {{since each}} plant will find expansion surface vertically on the netting mesh. As the plant grows vertically, besides the already mentioned benefits of increased aeration and sun exposure, the plant´s flowers and fruits are protected from accidental crushing {{due to the}} worker walking along the furrows. There is also a greater rate of flower pollination since the flowers are more exposed to insects as leaves will not tend to grow over flowers completely covering them. By {{taking care of the}} plant from <b>accidental</b> <b>damages</b> one extends the life span of the plant and the increasing the number of fruits harvested during a longer period.|$|R

But the strength of reinforced concrete can be reduced due to several reasons such as corrosion of the steel, <b>accidental</b> <b>damages,</b> etc. Hence to enhance the earning capacity, various techniques have been used. The use of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) {{is one of the}} latest techniques. In this research, the behavior of the TRP wrapped reinforced beams were studied and tested. Four samples were tested under two different loading arrangements. The increment of shear carrying capacity of the FRP reinforced beams was experimentally observed and results were compared.
