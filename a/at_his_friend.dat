5|$|However, she {{is being}} {{followed}} by a gang, led by a furious Telugu-speaking lady. Shiva manages to lose the pursuers and decides to change the route to avoid the gang, but encounters a second gang. He realises that this gang is not following Charulatha, but himself, as they are the henchmen of a Mumbai-based gangster Baali (Milind Soman). He recalls an incident that happened some years ago in Mumbai, when he stayed there <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>friend</b> Poochi's (Jagan) house. He had beaten one of Baali's men, who had attacked him, and later Baali himself, not knowing about him and his reputation in the city, and returned to Bangalore. Both gangs are following the couple to achieve their own ends. After reaching Mumbai and experiencing a series of events, they end up at Poochi's house. Poochi finds out where the grandmother lives and Shiva brings Charulatha there. Shiva, unable to bear {{the thought that the}} journey is complete, leaves silently only to find Charulatha on the road.

500|$|The {{story was}} {{originally}} entitled Man's Work and {{was set in}} Vermont, where Fleming had spent a number of summers <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>friend</b> Ivar Bryce's Black Hollow Farm, which became the model for von Hammerstein's hideaway, Echo Lake. The name of the villain of the story, Von Hammerstein was taken from General Baron Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord (1878–1943), one of Hitler's opponents. Fleming also considered calling the story [...] "Death Leaves an Echo" [...] and based the story on [...] "Rough Justice", {{which was to be}} episode three of the television series.|$|E

60|$|Fred was {{inclined}} to laugh <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>friend's</b> sudden change of manner, {{but there was something}} in the young surgeon's character--perhaps its deep earnestness--that rendered it impossible, <b>at</b> least for <b>his</b> <b>friends,</b> to be jocular when he was disposed to be serious. Fred became grave as he spoke.|$|R
500|$|In July 1991, {{while visiting}} with relatives, Reubens {{was arrested in}} Sarasota, Florida for masturbating during a film at an adult movie theater. During a random police inspection, a detective who had {{observed}} Reubens detained {{him as he was}} readying to leave. (This sweep also resulted in three other arrests). When detectives examined his driver's license, Reubens told them, [...] "I'm Pee-wee Herman", and offered to do a children's benefit for the sheriff's office, [...] "to take care of this". The next day, after a local reporter recognized Reubens' name, Reubens' attorney made the same offer to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune in exchange for withholding the story. In 1971, Reubens had been arrested in the same county for loitering and prowling near an adult theater, though charges were dropped. His second arrest was in 1983 when Reubens was placed on two years' probation for possession of marijuana, although adjudication was withheld. On the night of the arrest, Reubens went to Nashville, where his sister and lawyer lived, and then to New Jersey, where he would stay for the following months <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>friend</b> Doris Duke's estate.|$|E
2500|$|George lived a usual {{childhood}} {{existence for}} children of New York tenements: running around with his boyhood friends, roller skating and misbehaving in the streets. Remarkably, until 1908, he cared nothing for music, when as a ten year old he was intrigued by what he heard <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>friend</b> Maxie Rosenzweig's violin recital. The sound, and the way his friend played, captured him. His parents had bought a piano for lessons for his older brother Ira, but to his parents' surprise, and Ira's relief, it was George who spent more time playing it.|$|E
2500|$|Between {{his release}} in 1954 and 1960, Claudian {{worked as a}} {{researcher}} at the Romanian Academy's Iași chapter, leading a withdrawn life at his house on Copou Hill, or <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>friend</b> Mircea Spiridoneanu's home, and often rejoining Zoe in Bucharest. From 1957, the Securitate police opened a file on him, worried about his nighttime contacts with PSDI militants, some of whom were its own informers. These suspected him of [...] "subverting the state" [...] and of promoting a [...] "Western political regime", but were unable to penetrate his innermost circle of friends, and considered tapping his telephone.|$|E

2500|$|Cinaedus is a {{derogatory}} word denoting a {{male who}} was gender-deviant; {{his choice of}} sex acts, or preference in sexual partner, was secondary to his perceived deficiencies as a [...] "man" [...] (vir). Catullus directs the slur cinaedus <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>friend</b> Furius in his notoriously obscene Carmen 16. Although in some contexts cinaedus may denote an anally passive man and is the most frequent word for a male who {{allowed himself to be}} penetrated anally, a man called cinaedus might also have sex with and be considered highly attractive to women. Cinaedus is not equivalent to the English vulgarism [...] "faggot", except that both words can be used to deride a male considered deficient in manhood or with androgynous characteristics whom women may find sexually alluring.|$|E
2500|$|As Victory {{approached}} the enemy {{line on the}} morning of 21 October 1805, Hardy urged Nelson to transfer to another ship to avoid the inevitable melee, but Nelson refused. Victory, leading the weather column, came under heavy fire in the opening stages of the Battle of Trafalgar. At one point, a splinter took the buckle from Hardy's shoe, to which Nelson remarked, [...] "This is too warm work Hardy, to last for long". Hardy was with Nelson when he was shot and, {{towards the end of the}} battle, as Nelson lay below dying, the two had a number of conversations together. Hardy was able to tell Nelson that 14 or 15 enemy ships had struck their flags: Nelson replied that he had [...] "bargained for 20". In their last conversation, Nelson reminded Hardy to anchor the fleet. Nelson went on to say [...] "take care of my dear Lady Hamilton, Hardy, take care of poor Lady Hamilton" [...] and then when the moment came for the two men to part for the last time, Nelson then very close to death, asked Hardy to kiss him. Hardy kissed him on the cheek; [...] "Now I am satisfied," [...] said Nelson, [...] "Thank God I have done my duty". Hardy stood up and then having spent a few moments looking down silently <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>friend,</b> knelt and kissed him again on the forehead. [...] "Who is that?" [...] asked Nelson, now barely able to see. [...] "It is Hardy" [...] Hardy replied. [...] "God bless you Hardy" [...] was Nelson's last response. Victory was towed to Gibraltar, arriving on 28 October 1805, where she underwent major repairs, before setting set sail for England on 4 November 1805 and arriving at Portsmouth on 5 December 1805. There Nelson's body was transferred to the Sheerness Commissioner, Sir George Grey, 1st Baronet's yacht Chatham to proceed to Greenwich. Hardy carried one of the banners at Nelson's funeral procession on 9 January 1806.|$|E
