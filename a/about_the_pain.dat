5|$|The sexual {{allegations}} apart, {{several people}} discussed how the vegetotherapy had hurt them physically as children, as therapists pressed {{hard on the}} body to loosen muscular armour. Reich's son, Peter, wrote in his autobiography, Book of Dreams (1973) <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> this had caused him. Susanna Steig, the daughter of William Steig, the New Yorker cartoonist, wrote about being pressed so hard during Reichian therapy that she had difficulty breathing, and said that a woman therapist had sexually assaulted her. According to Turner, a nurse complained in 1952 to the New York Medical Society that an OIRC therapist had taught her five-year-old son how to masturbate. The therapist was arrested, but the case was dropped when Reich agreed to close the OIRC.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the episode}} was filmed on the Daedalus set. Due to that, visual effects were {{required}} {{to fill in the}} external shots. The episode was reportedly {{one of the most expensive}} VFX budgets in the series, and is the most expensive for the season. The star map behind the captain's chair of the Daedalus is usually lit green. However, the episode's writer and supervising producer, Alan McCullough, deliberately turned the map 90 degrees and changed the color from green to orange, so as to make the ship different from the normal Daedalus. McCullough also stated that the episode is a one-off, but did not rule out a return beyond the fifth season. He also said that he originally planned the team to visit a reality where the Ancients won the war against the Wraith, but this idea was dropped as it would detract from the main storyline. The episode was Jason Momoa's first appearance with his customised wig. After he had his hair cut by the time the fourth season was completed, for the first three episodes he had it sewn back on. However, when SCI FI wouldn't allow his hairstyle to be changed, they switched to the wig after Momoa complained <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of having his hair sewn on again.|$|E

25|$|Mai's role is more {{prominent}} in the anime. Early in the season she had problems with constantly moving; because she thought everyone hated her after making friends and then abandoning them, she became so depressed that she refused to go to school. She understood {{the impact of their}} journeys on others, but unlike Ai, did not have the maturity to cope with it. Early on in the series she makes friends with a classmate of hers, Konami. When it was time for Mai to leave, Konami helped convince Mai that she was wrong and in consolation Konami left a sketch portrait of Mai she made for a class assignment as a departing gift stating that they will remain friends forever, even if they never see each other again. While waiting for Mai's return, Konami passes away two years before the mansion is in a location where the two could meet again. Later in the series, Mai meets Konami's daughter; she initially mistakes her for Konami but quickly learns her name is Mai and that she was named by Konami in memory of her friend. Mai discovers that Konami's daughter has more in common with her than a name: she, like her namesake, feels that everyone hates her. As a result, Mai feels it her duty to both Konami and her daughter to show her that way of thinking was wrong, just as Konami did for her. Mai ultimately gave up and failed at the time when she Konami had still been waiting for her even as she lay dying. This, compounded with Keith's words <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> the girls bring to others, reawakening her depression in a much deeper manner. When she returns to visit Konami later and leaves, as a departing request, asks Konami to explain to her daughter what she felt so that she would not follow the same path as the younger sister Mai. Along with Mea, the maid, Mai is left at one point when the mansion disappears into the future without them. It is during this time that Mai realizes that she cannot age and Ai explains the connection to the mansion and aging process. Mai is voiced by Mio Oukawa in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Masumi Asano and in English by Nicole Bouma.|$|E

The track is also Aguilera's first country song. It lasts for a duration of [...] (four minutes and 13 seconds). [...] "Just a Fool" [...] was composed in the key of G major, with a moderate slow tempo of 56 beats per minute. Many instruments were featured on the track, including keyboards, guitars and strings. It starts with a simple guitar riff and a toe-tapping mid-tempo drum beat. Chris Youne of 4Music described the song as a [...] "pop-meets-rock-meets-country" [...] song. Lyrically, [...] "Just a Fool" [...] talks <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of a break-up.

Smith approached its recording {{as he would}} remixing a song, working with a demo of bass, guitar, and vocal parts at his own studio and incorporating house and techno elements. Midway, [...] "Reunion" [...] develops a refrain of [...] "did I ... see you ... see me ... in a new light?", and pulsating steel drums lead to a somber, rhythmic dance section. Its pulsating beat transitions into [...] "Sunset", a song <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> shared by estranged ex-lovers. The song's muted beat adds tension to the narrative, which Calvert interprets to be [...] "the couple's final farewell – the beat serves to denote the passing of time." [...] "Sunset" [...] also has a subtle UK garage beat, funky house elements, and {{was inspired by the}} music from Smith's DJing gigs; Croft cited it as [...] "an example of the idea of a kind of song we're all really into, which is heartbreaking dance music". Consequence of Sound's Harley Brown views that [...] "Reunion" [...] and [...] "Sunset" [...] make up a congruous mix at [...] "the heart of the album", as Smith [...] "indie-streams these house varieties ... slowing down and alienating beats from their context so they’re even more universal, unobscured by their dance floor origins.|$|E

[...] Madonna said the song describes Wallis Simpson and is [...] "about a woman who has fallen in love with this untouchable thing, this man that was raised to be king. One of the lines of the song 'it must be so hard to always be the chosen one.' At {{the end of the day}} nothing is indestructible, no matter how high you might rise in the world you are still a human being." [...] Marc Schneider from Billboard described [...] "Masterpiece" [...] as a slowed-down, moody ballad that showcases strong execution of vocals from Madonna. He described the production as [...] "simple, direct and reminiscent of her sound in the 1990s". The lyrics were described as emotional, and was comparable to the film's love story, with the chorus as follows: [...] "And I'm right by your side, Like a thief in the night, I stand in front of a masterpiece. And I can't tell you why it hurts so much to be in love with a masterpiece. 'Cause after all, nothing's indestructible".|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Australian {{producer}} Ian Collie {{produced a}} documentary film on P. L. Travers titled The Shadow of [...] "Mary Poppins". During the documentary's production, Collie {{noticed that there}} was [...] "an obvious biopic there" [...] and convinced Essential Media and Entertainment to develop a feature film with Sue Smith writing the screenplay. The project {{attracted the attention of}} BBC Films, which decided to finance the project, and Ruby Films' Alison Owen, who subsequently hired Kelly Marcel to co-write the screenplay with Smith. Marcel's drafts removed a subplot involving Travers and her son, and divided the story into a two-part narrative: the creative conflict between Travers and Walt Disney, and her dealings with her childhood issues, describing it as [...] "a story <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of a little girl who suffered, and the grown woman who allowed herself to let go". Marcel's version, however, featured certain intellectual property rights of music and imagery which would be impossible to use without permission from The Walt Disney Company. [...] "There was always that elephant in the room, which is Disney," [...] Collie recalled. [...] "We knew Walt Disney was a key character in the film and we wanted to use quite a bit of the music. We knew we'd eventually have to show Disney." [...] In early 2010, Robert B. Sherman provided producer Alison Owen with an advance copy of a salient chapter from his then upcoming book release, [...] [...] The chapter entitled, [...] "'Tween Pavement and Stars" [...] contained characterizations and anecdotes which proved seminal to Marcel's script rewrite, in particular, the anecdote about there not being the color red in London. In July 2011, while attending the Ischia Film Festival, Owen met with Corky Hale, who offered to present the screenplay to Richard M. Sherman. Sherman read the screenplay and gave the producers his support. Later that year, Marcel and Smith's screenplay was listed in Franklin Leonard's The Black List, voted by producers {{as one of the best}} screenplays that were not in production.|$|E

Despite these criticisms, Joshi argues that since Gerald's Game (1993), King has been tempering the worst of his writing faults, producing books that are leaner, more believable and generally better written. Joshi suggests that King's strengths as a writer include the accessible [...] "everyman" [...] quality of his prose, and his unfailingly insightful observations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>pains</b> and joys of adolescence. Joshi cites two early non-supernatural novels—Rage (1977) and The Running Man (1982)—as King's best, suggesting both are riveting and well-constructed suspense thrillers, with believable characters.|$|R
