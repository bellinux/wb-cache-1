A similar contrast appears at story's end on Solaris with Kelvin's [...] "Winter" [...] visit to his father's house, featuring a frozen pond surrounded by bare trees. The dead scenery of this island on Solaris contrasts with the earlier, Summer pond scenes of long-bladed green grasses or ferns gently floating in the water current underneath blooming trees. The Solaris ocean was created with acetone, <b>aluminium</b> <b>powder,</b> and dyes. Mikhail Romadin designed the space station as lived-in, beat-up and decrepit rather than shiny, neat and futuristic. The designer and director consulted with scientist and aerospace engineer Lupichev, who lent them a 1960s-era mainframe computer for set decoration. For some of the sequences, Romadin designed a mirror room which enabled the cameraman, Yusov, to hide within a mirrored sphere {{so as to be}} invisible in the finished film. Akira Kurosawa, who was visiting the Mosfilm studios just then, expressed admiration for the space station design.|$|E

SEM photographs showed that samples exposed to bio field after 38 days showed growth in particle size and particles joined at inter and intra particle boundaries.

The reference formulation was an AP/HTPB/Al composition with 68 / 17 / 15 % mass fractions respectively. The ballistic {{characterization of}} the propellants, in terms of steady burning rates, shows better performance for propellant compositions employing nano-aluminium when compared to micro-aluminium.

2500|$|The Directorate of Logistics of the Air Forces {{eventually}} {{requested to}} Gelperin {{the development of}} a five-ton bomb, capable of being dropped by the Pe-8, the heaviest Soviet bomber of the time. The definitive version of the FAB-5000 was fitted with six contact lateral fuses, and the warhead was filled with [...] of an explosive mixture of TNT, RDX, and <b>aluminium</b> <b>powder.</b> The number of fuses ensured that the force of the blast would disperse laterally, which increases the damage in areas such as industrial compounds and military facilities. In order to load the device, the bomb bay doors had to remain half-open. The tests, however, were successful. Two bombs were dropped, one from an altitude of 4,000m and the other from 3,300m. The first bomb fell in open ground, leaving a crater [...] in diameter and [...] in depth. Grass in a radius of 150m was charred. The second bomb landed in the woods, and left a crater of [...] in diameter and [...] in depth. Some 600 trees were torn out within a 70m radius, while 30 percent of the trees within 135m also fell down. Later tests produced craters up to [...] in diameter and [...] in depth. The project was brought to the assembly line and the bomb was hastily put in service on 15 February 1943. By the end of the war, 98 FAB-5000s had been delivered to the Soviet Air Forces, all of them produced in 1943.|$|E
