5|$|In many species, fleas are principally a {{nuisance}} to their hosts, causing an itching sensation {{which in turn}} causes the host to try to remove the pest by biting, pecking or scratching. Fleas <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> a source of annoyance, however. Flea bites cause a slightly raised, swollen itching spot to form; this has a single puncture point at the centre, like a mosquito bite. Besides this, the eczematous itchy skin disease flea allergy dermatitis is common in many host species, including dogs and cats. The bites often appear in clusters or lines of two bites, and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks afterwards. Fleas can lead to hair loss {{as a result of}} frequent scratching and biting by the animal, and can cause anemia in extreme cases.|$|E
25|$|Tibetans <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> an underclass; {{there is}} a {{substantial}} Tibetan middle class, based in government service, tourism, commerce, and small-scale manufacturing/ transportation. There are also many unemployed or under-employed Tibetans, but almost no unemployed or underemployed Han because those who cannot find work leave.|$|E

25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the linguistic impairments associated with a mutation of the FOXP2 gene <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> the result of a fundamental deficit in motor control. For examples, the impairments include difficulties in comprehension. Brain imaging of affected individuals indicates functional abnormalities in language-related cortical and basal/ganglia regions, demonstrating that the problems extend beyond the motor system.|$|E
25|$|Active {{listening}} – Listening is {{more than}} just hearing what the other side is saying. Active listening involves paying close attention to what is being said verbally and nonverbally. It involves periodically seeking further clarification from the person. By asking the person exactly what they mean, they may realize you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> walking through a routine, but rather take them seriously.|$|E
25|$|The {{faithful}} {{revisit the}} events of the day through public reading of specific Psalms and the Gospels, and singing hymns about Christ's death. Rich visual imagery and symbolism as well as stirring hymnody are remarkable elements of these observances. In the Orthodox understanding, {{the events of}} Holy Week <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> an annual commemoration of past events, but the faithful actually participate in the death and resurrection of Jesus.|$|E

50|$|Chalion is a looking-glass {{version of}} the kingdom of Castile and León, and the novel is loosely based on the lives of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, the unifiers of Spain.However, the story of The Curse of Chalion <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> a retelling of the lives of Isabella and Ferdinand, and Chalion <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> Castile. The story takes quite a {{different}} path from the historical one, and the major characters <b>are</b> distinct personalities, <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> versions of historical people.|$|R

25|$|The gospels {{can be seen}} {{as having}} three {{separate}} lines: A literary line which looks at it from a textual perspective, secondly a historical line which observes how Christianity started as a renewal movement within Judaism and eventually separated from it, and finally a theological line which analyzes Christian teachings. Within the historical perspective, the gospels <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> used to establish the existence of Jesus as sources in their own right alone, but their content is compared and contrasted to non-Christian sources, and the historical context, to draw conclusions about the historicity of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|Baudrillard's earlier {{books were}} {{attempts}} {{to argue that}} the first two of these values <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> associated, but are disrupted by the third and, particularly, the fourth. Later, Baudrillard rejected Marxism totally (The Mirror of Production and Symbolic Exchange and Death). But the focus on the difference between sign value (which relates to commodity exchange) and symbolic value (which relates to Maussian gift exchange) remained in his work up until his death. Indeed, it came to play a more and more important role, particularly in his writings on world events.|$|E
25|$|Although Marian art items may {{at times}} be viewed from an artistic {{perspective}} and sold at auctions, or discussed from an academic viewpoint {{in the context}} of art history, from a religious viewpoint they form part of the very fabric of Roman Catholic Marian culture through their emotional impact on the veneration of the Blessed Virgin. Images such as Our Lady of Guadalupe and the many artistic renditions of it as statues <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> works of art but are a central elements of the daily lives of the Mexican people. Both Hidalgo and Zapata flew Guadalupan flags and depictions of the Virgin of Guadalupe continue to remain a key unifying element in the Mexican nation. The study of Mary via the field of Mariology is thus inherently intertwined with Marian art.|$|E

25|$|Although {{every year}} over five million pilgrims visit Lourdes and Guadalupe each, {{the volume of}} Roman Catholic art to {{accompany}} this enthusiasm has been essentially restricted to popular images. Hence although apparitions {{have resulted in the}} construction of very large Marian churches at Lourdes and Guadalupe they have not so far had a similar impact on Marian art. Yet images such as Our Lady of Guadalupe and the artistic renditions of it as statues <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> works of art but are a central elements of the daily lives of the Mexican people. Both Miguel Hidalgo and Emiliano Zapata flew Guadalupan flags as their protector, and Zapata's men wore the Guadalupan image around their necks and on their sombreros. Depictions of the Virgin of Guadalupe continue to remain a key unifying element in the Mexican nation, and as the main national symbol of Mexico.|$|E
500|$|As {{they are}} the movie's [...] "central {{dramatic}} piece", the encoffining ceremonies in Departures have received extensive commentary. Mike Scott, for instance, wrote in The Times-Picayune that these scenes were beautiful and heartbreaking, and Nicholas Barber of The Independent described them as [...] "elegant and dignified". James Adams of The Globe and Mail wrote {{that they were a}} [...] "dignified ritual of calming, hypnotic grace, with sleights of hand bordering on the magicianly". As the film continues, Paul Byrnes of The Sydney Morning Herald opined, the audience gains an improved knowledge of the ceremony and its importance. Viewers see that the ceremonies <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> about preparing the body, but also about [...] "bring dignity to death, respect to the deceased and solace to those who grieve", through which the encoffiners are able to help repair broken family ties and heal damage done to those left behind.|$|E
500|$|Makeba {{said that}} she did not perform {{political}} music, but music about her personal life in South Africa, which included describing the pain she felt living under apartheid. She once stated [...] "people say I sing politics, but what I sing is not politics, it is the truth", an example of the mixing of personal and political issues for musicians living during apartheid. When she first entered the US, she avoided discussing apartheid explicitly, partly out of concern for her family still in South Africa. Nonetheless, she is known for using her voice to convey the political message of opposition to apartheid, performing widely and frequently for civil rights and anti-apartheid organisations. Even songs that did not carry an explicitly political message were seen as subversive, due to their being banned in South Africa. Makeba saw her music as a tool of activism, saying [...] "In our struggle, songs <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> entertainment for us. They are the way we communicate." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{broadcast}} in the United States on NBC on Monday, September 21, 1998, in the 9:3010 p.m. (PST) timeslot. In its original American broadcast, the pilot tied with Working for forty-first place in {{ratings for the}} week of September 21–27, 1998. With a Nielsen rating of 8.6, equivalent to approximately 8.4 million viewing households, it was the fifteenth-highest-rated show on NBC the week it aired. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Joyce Millman of Salon Entertainment said the episode has [...] "glimmers of class" [...] and the jokes are [...] "relatively sophisticated". John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that Burrows's direction was [...] "sharp as usual" [...] and the writing was [...] "above average". Brian Lambert of the St. Paul Pioneer Press said the pilot was [...] "nicely staged by veteran director Jimmy Burrows, and coming from a couple producers, Max Mutchnick and David Cohan, who assisted Boston Common and Dream On, the show – {{which is to say}} the pilot episode (everything could go to hell next week) – has the best verbal interplay of any of the season's new sitcoms." [...] William Horn from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) thought the episode was a [...] "wonderful" [...] representation of a gay man's life [...] "regardless of whether he's in a relationship in that very moment. I think it's important that American audiences realize that lesbians and gay men <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> all about sexual situations." [...] Ellen Gray of the Chicago Tribune was also positive about the show: [...] "For those who believe that Hollywood's engaging in a conspiracy to 'normalize' a sexual orientation that many Americans still find abhorrent, Will & Grace will look like a candy-coated poison pill. To those who think that Hollywood isn't moving fast enough in offering sexual parity for gays, it may just look like poison. But... there's a large audience out there that's somewhere in the mushy middle, an audience that might be ready to embrace Will & Grace." ...|$|E

2500|$|The term {{thrombocyte}} (clot cell) [...] {{came into}} {{use in the}} early 1900s and is sometimes used as a synonym for platelet; but not generally in the scientific literature, except as a root word for other terms related to platelets (e.g. [...] thrombocytopenia meaning low platelets).
