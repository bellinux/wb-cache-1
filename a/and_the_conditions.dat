5|$|In 1856, German {{physician}} and pathologist Rudolf Virchow published what {{is referred to}} as Virchow's triad, the three major causes of thrombosis. The triad provides the theoretical framework for the current explanation of venous thrombosis, although it was focused on the effect of a foreign body in the venous system <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> required for clot propagation.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} specified {{a budget}} of £25,000 (previously figures of both £5,000 and £100,000 had been discussed), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> of entry stated that the memorial was to be situated {{at the entrance to}} Government House on the corner of King William Street and North Terrace, placing it just behind the existing memorial to the South African War. This location was counter to previous suggestions: a 1919 survey of architects had proposed that the memorial should be built on Montefiore Hill, while in 1923 the plans for the memorial involved erecting it at the rear of Government House, rather than at the front.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is divided}} into six environments, each {{representing}} a different setting from the film. To accomplish {{the objective of the}} game, the player must guide E.T. into the wells. Once all items found in a well are collected, the player must levitate E.T. out of them. An icon at the top of each screen represents the current area, each area enabling the player to perform different actions. Antagonists include a scientist who takes E.T. for observation and an FBI agent who chases the alien to confiscate one of the collected telephone pieces, or candy. The game offers diverse difficulty settings that affect the number and speed of humans present, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> needed to accomplish the objective.|$|E

5|$|During her pre-war New York – Antwerp sailings, Kroonland carried {{some notable}} and {{interesting}} passengers. On 1 August 1904, {{one of the}} ship's passengers arrived in New York as somewhat of a mystery woman. She recounted that she had gone out for dinner in Antwerp and awakened to find herself at sea with only the white silk evening gown she was wearing. Having no money or luggage, she was barred from entering the United States and was compelled to remain on board the ship. After her predicament was reported in The New York Times, she received letters and telegrams that included marriage proposals. Her background story and a letter of credit eventually verified her identity, but she was deported after a New York doctor pronounced her insane. Later the same month The New York Times reported on first-class passengers' complaints over privileges for their dogs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> in the kennel aboard the liner. One passenger was determined to have her dog in her state room, and after others joined her in removing canine companions from the kennel, Kroonlands crew took all the dogs back to the kennel. Many of the dog owners refused {{to speak to the}} others involved {{for the duration of the}} voyage.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Skorokhodov, {{yet another}} of the guards, smuggled in a {{birthday}} cake to celebrate Maria's nineteenth birthday on June 26, 1918. Maria slipped away from the group with Ivan Skorokhodov for a private moment and they were discovered together in a compromising position when two of his superiors conducted a surprise inspection of the house. Skorokhodov was removed from his position after his actions and friendliness towards the grand duchess were discovered by his commanding officers. In their memoirs, several guards reported that both the Tsarina and her older sister Olga appeared angry with Maria {{in the days following}} the incident and that Olga avoided her company. After this incident, a new command was installed, the family was forbidden from fraternizing with the officers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> of their imprisonment became even more strict.|$|E

5|$|On 24 March 2009, it was {{revealed}} that the fate of 5,900 artefacts retrieved from the wreck would rest with a U.S. District Judge's decision. The ruling was later issued in two decisions on 12 August 2010 and 15 August 2011. As announced in 2009, the judge ruled that RMS Titanic Inc. owned the artefacts and her decision dealt with the status of the wreck as well as establishing a monitoring system to check future activity upon the wreck site. On 12August 2010, Judge Rebecca Beach Smith granted RMSTitanic, Inc. fair market value for the artefacts but deferred ruling on their ownership <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> for their preservation, possible disposition and exhibition until a further decision could be reached. On 15 August 2011, Judge Smith granted title to thousands of artefacts from the Titanic, that RMS Titanic Inc. did not already own under a French court decision concerning the first group of salvaged artefacts, to RMS Titanic Inc. subject to a detailed list of conditions concerning preservation and disposition of the items. The artefacts can be sold only to a company that would abide by the lengthy list of conditions and restrictions. RMS Titanic Inc. can profit from the artefacts through exhibiting them.|$|E
5|$|The chronicler Symeon of Durham {{asserted}} that when St-Calais was consecrated bishop by Archbishop Thomas of York, {{he managed to}} avoid professing obedience to the archbishop, which, if true, would have freed St-Calais from interference in his diocese. After his appointment, St-Calais decided to replace his cathedral chapter of secular clergy with monks, and consulted the king and Lanfranc, the Archbishop of Canterbury, before going to Rome to receive permission from Pope Gregory VII. These consultations, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> within his diocese, may have kept St-Calais from visiting Durham until some time after his elevation. In 1083 he expelled the married clergy from the cathedral, and moved a small community of monks from Bede's old monastery at Jarrow to Durham, to form the new chapter. This community had been founded at Jarrow by Reinfrid, a Norman ex-knight and monk of Evesham Abbey, and Eadwine, an English monk from Winchcombe Abbey. After the community had settled in Durham, St-Calais named Eadwine as prior, and arranged for lands to be set aside to support the monks. The expelled clergy were offered the option of joining the new monastic house, but only one actually joined.|$|E
5|$|The {{first half}} of the game is set on a whaler {{in the middle of a}} storm, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> on the deck affect the degree of control the player has over Hansen. As the ship sways {{continuously}} from side to side, aiming is made more difficult, although Hansen can grab onto a ledge to steady himself, if one is available. In some instances, the ship can sway to such a degree that Hansen will slide towards the edge and potentially fall overboard. There are also numerous environmental hazards on the deck which react to the motion of the ship, such as swinging electrical wires and crates hooked up to ropes. If any of these items hit Hansen, he will lose health. Waves crashing on to the ship's deck can also cause Hansen damage.|$|E

5|$|Toyo Miyatake, who {{was born}} in Kagawa, Shikoku, Japan, in 1896, immigrated to the United States in 1909. He settled in the Little Tokyo section of Los Angeles, and was incarcerated at Manzanar along with his family. A photographer, Miyatake smuggled a lens and film holder into Manzanar and later had a {{craftsman}} construct a wooden box with a door that hid the lens. He took many now-famous photos of life <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> at Manzanar. His contraband camera was eventually discovered by the camp administration and confiscated. However, camp director Ralph Merritt later allowed Miyatake to photograph freely within the camp, even though he was not allowed to actually press the shutter button, requiring a guard or camp official to perform this simple task. Merritt finally saw no point to this technicality, and allowed Miyatake to take photos.|$|E
