5|$|Five North Korean Army (KPA) {{divisions}} massed {{around the}} city preparing to cross the Naktong River and assault it {{from the north and}} west. Defending the city were the 1st Cavalry Division and the ROK II Corps. In a series of engagements, each of the North Korean divisions attempted to cross the Naktong and attack the defending forces. The success of these attacks varied by region, but <b>attacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1st Cavalry Division sector were repulsed and the <b>attacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South Korean sector were more successful.|$|E

5|$|Attempts by anti-war {{officials}} in Istanbul to apologise for the incident were botched by Enver. The British quickly retaliated with naval <b>attacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dardanelles, the Russians {{declared war on}} 2 November, followed by the British and the French three days later. The Ottomans did not officially declare war until 11 November.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold War {{there have}} been a number of {{attempts}} to curb military activity or even abolish the armed forces altogether. A notable referendum on the subject, launched by an anti-militarist group, was held on 26 November 1989. It was defeated with about two thirds of the voters against the proposal. A similar referendum, called for before, but held shortly after the 11 September <b>attacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US, was defeated by over 78% of voters.|$|E
5|$|Once {{again the}} fatal {{weakness}} of the North Korean Army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success-its communications and supply were not capable of exploiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack {{in the face of}} massive air, armor, and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points. By September 8, the North Korean <b>attacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area had been repulsed.|$|E
50|$|The {{market was}} {{a target of}} {{terrorism}} during <b>the</b> spate of <b>attacks</b> <b>in</b> Cairo <b>in</b> April 2005. <b>The</b> suicide <b>attack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market, on April 7, killed 21 people (eleven Egyptians, two French tourists, one American, and seven foreigners of unidentified origin). It was <b>the</b> first <b>attack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series; this <b>attack</b> drove away tourists from Egypt in general and Khan el-Khalili in particular for some time.|$|R
50|$|The Egyptians {{launched}} their offensive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early morning of October 14, at 6:30. The mechanized infantry brigade was to <b>attack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{direction of the}} Gidi Pass, one armored brigade was to <b>attack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of the Mitla Pass, one brigade was to attack towards Baluza, and two brigades were to <b>attack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of Tasa. As anticipated by many Egyptian officers, the attack was a failure. Encountering stiff Israeli resistance, the Egyptian assault {{came to a halt}} after suffering heavy losses, and Egyptian troops retreated back to their lines on the Suez Canal.|$|R

5|$|Targeted Killing in International Law is a {{book about}} the {{legality}} of targeted killing, written by Nils Melzer. It was first published by Oxford University Press in May 2008. The book explores the history of targeted killing as a government strategy by multiple countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Switzerland and Germany; for both military and law enforcement purposes. Melzer argues that directly after the September 11 <b>attacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, perceptions of the tactic became more positive.|$|E
5|$|The GH ART {{exhibit at}} the 2008 Games Convention in Leipzig, Germany, {{included}} an art game, Invaders!, based on Space Invaderss gameplay.

5|$|The communists {{were pleased}} by the coup, as the South Vietnamese {{military}} was wasting its resources and energy on infighting. They did not make any <b>attacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days immediately after the coup as they were worried their doing so might galvanize the divided society into action against a common cause.|$|E

5|$|The {{cost of the}} Senedd {{increased}} from £12M in 1997 to £69.6M in 2006, an increase of 580%. In a report published in March 2008 by the Wales Audit Office, {{the reason for the}} difference between the two costs were that the original estimate of £12M was not based on any detailed design of the final requirements of the building. Extra costs of the building were due to unforeseen security measures after the 11 September <b>attacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|E

5|$|After {{the start}} of the World War I, he became the subject of anti-German <b>attacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Press. In 1915, Speyer offered to resign from the Privy Council and to {{relinquish}} his baronetcy, but the Prime Minister turned down the offer. He resigned as chairman of the UERL and went to the United States. In 1921, the British government investigated accusations that Speyer had traded with the enemy during the war, and had participated in other wartime conduct incompatible with his status as a British subject. Speyer denied the charges, but his naturalisation was revoked and he was struck off the list of members of the Privy Council.|$|E
5|$|Army Group Centre renewed their {{offensive}} on Moscow in mid-November. Fegelein and the SS Cavalry Brigade {{were held}} back as an operational reserve in the rearward {{area of the}} 9th Army. Massive counter-attacks by the Red Army led to a weakening of the entire German line, and the brigade {{was called in to}} fight at the front on 28 December. While Fegelein reported that his forces were the equivalent to one or two divisions, in reality he had only 4,428 men in total at this point, of which 1,800 were ready for action. The brigade was deployed at the south-eastern sector of the XXIII Army Corps, where it defended against <b>attacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rearward area of the 206th Infantry Division in the Battles of Rzhev. The SS Cavalry Brigade took serious losses, with casualties of up to 60 per cent in some squadrons.|$|E
