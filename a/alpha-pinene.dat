50|$|The Midland Alpine Borane Reduction, {{or simply}} the Midland Reduction, {{allows for the}} {{asymmetric}} reduction of carbonyls (primarily ketones) to alcohols. It {{was developed in the}} late 1970s by Professor M. Mark Midland at the University of California, Riverside. The Midland Reduction is particularly useful because <b>alpha-pinene</b> is regenerated (although it is fairly cheap, so this matters less than with other chiral molecules), and because both enantiomers are commercially available. The Alpine borane can be synthesized by refluxing <b>alpha-pinene</b> and 9-BBN in THF. While both enantiomers of alpine borane are commercially available, it is far cheaper to make than buy.|$|E

50|$|Tangerines are a {{good source}} of vitamin C, folate, and beta-carotene. They also contain some potassium; magnesium; {{vitamins}} B1, B2, and B3; and the compounds lutein and zeaxanthin. Tangerine oil, like all citrus oils, has limonene as its major constituent, but also <b>alpha-pinene,</b> myrcene, gamma-terpinene, citronellal, linalool, neral, neryl acetate, geranyl acetate, geraniol, thymol, and carvone.|$|E
50|$|Turpentine is {{also used}} {{as a source of}} raw {{materials}} in the synthesis of fragrant chemical compounds. Commercially used camphor, linalool, alpha-terpineol, and geraniol are all usually produced from <b>alpha-pinene</b> and beta-pinene, which are two of the chief chemical components of turpentine. These pinenes are separated and purified by distillation. The mixture of diterpenes and triterpenes that is left as residue after turpentine distillation is sold as rosin.|$|E
50|$|The resin {{produced}} by most plants is composed mainly of terpenes and derivatives. The most common terpenes in resin are the bicyclic terpenes <b>alpha-pinene,</b> beta-pinene, delta-3 carene, and sabinene, the monocyclic terpenes limonene and terpinolene, and smaller {{amounts of the}} tricyclic sesquiterpenes, longifolene, caryophyllene and delta-cadinene. Some resins also contain {{a high proportion of}} resin acids. The individual components of resin can be separated by fractional distillation. Rosins on the other hand are less volatile and consist, inter alia, of diterpenes.|$|E
50|$|Camphene is a bicyclic monoterpene. It {{is nearly}} {{insoluble}} in water, but very soluble in common organic solvents. It volatilizes readily {{at room temperature}} and has a pungent smell. It is a minor constituent of many essential oils such as turpentine, cypress oil, camphor oil, citronella oil, neroli, ginger oil, and valerian. It is produced industrially by catalytic isomerization of the more common <b>alpha-pinene.</b> Camphene {{is used in the}} preparation of fragrances and as a food additive for flavoring. Its mid-19th century use as a fuel for lamps was limited by its explosiveness.|$|E
50|$|Blue Dream is a {{cross between}} the Blueberry and Haze strains, and was created around 2003 in Santa Cruz, California. Its more remote ancestry {{includes}} Afghani, Thai, and Mexican strains. It is a clone-only strain propagated by cuttings, and is known for producing large harvests, as much as seven ounces per plant. Widely used for medical purposes, as of 2014 samples were testing at up to 25% THC and 2% CBD content. Blue Dream is high in terpenes as well, particularly <b>alpha-Pinene,</b> which is a bronchodilator and an antibiotic.|$|E
50|$|The first CLOUD {{experiments}} {{showed that}} sulphuric acid (derived from sulphur dioxide, for which fossil fuels are the predominant source) as such {{has a much}} smaller effect than had been assumed. In 2014, CLOUD researchers presented newer experimental results showing an interaction between oxidised biogenic vapours (e.g., <b>alpha-pinene</b> emitted by trees) and sulphuric acid. Ions produced in the atmosphere by galactic cosmic rays enhance the formation rate of these particles significantly, provided the concentrations of sulphuric acid and oxidised organic vapours are quite low. This new process may account for seasonal variations in atmospheric aerosol particles, which are being related to higher global tree emissions in the northern hemisphere summer.|$|E
50|$|The {{essential}} oil of frankincense {{is produced by}} steam distillation of the tree resin. The oil's chemical components are 75% monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, monoterpenoles, sesquiterpenols and ketones. It has a good balsamic sweet fragrance, while the Indian frankincense oil has a very fresh smell. Contrary to what some commercial entities claim, steam or hydro distilled frankincense oils do not contain boswellic acids (triterpenoids), although may be present in trace quantities in the solvent extracted products. The chemistry of the {{essential oil}} is mainly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, such as <b>alpha-pinene,</b> Limonene, alpha-Thujene, and beta-Pinene with small amounts of diterpenoid components being the upper limit in terms of molecular weight.|$|E
5000|$|Sour Diesel is {{a hybrid}} strain of Cannabis sativa. Described as [...] "a cross between {{cannabis}} and caffeine", {{it is known}} for its [...] "uplifting qualities" [...] and its pungent aromas of fuel and citrus. Samples of the strain have tested as high as 30.6% THC, and the strain is also high in the terpenes <b>alpha-Pinene,</b> caryophyllene, and humulene. In 2016 it was the fourth most popular strain in the United States, after Blue Dream, Girl Scout Cookies, and Gorilla Glue #4, {{according to a report by}} the cannabis information site Leafly.

5000|$|The {{essential}} oil of kumquat peel contains {{much of the}} aroma of the fruit, and is composed principally of limonene, which makes up around 93% of the total. [...] Besides limonene and <b>alpha-pinene</b> (0.34%), both monoterpenes, the oil is unusually rich (0.38% total) in sesquiterpenes such as α-bergamotene (0.021%), caryophyllene (0.18%), α-humulene (0.07%) and α-muurolene (0.06%), and these contribute to the spicy and woody flavor of the fruit. Carbonyl compounds make up much of the remainder, and these are responsible {{for much of the}} distinctive flavor. These compounds include esters such as isopropyl propanoate (1.8%) and terpinyl acetate (1.26%); ketones such as carvone (0.175%); and a range of aldehydes such as citronellal (0.6%) and 2-methylundecanal. Other oxygenated compounds include nerol (0.22%) and trans-linalool oxide (0.15%).|$|E
5000|$|This {{species is}} {{strongly}} aromatic, and is gathered for medicinal use. The name Buchu {{is from the}} Khoikhoi word for the plant meaning [...] "dusting powder". The Hottentots used an infusion of the dried leaves as a diuretic and cure for urinary tract disorders and pulverised the fragrant rue-like leaves to powder their bodies and act as an insect deterrent. In the 19th century the leaves were introduced into Europe. The leaves are used {{to add to the}} aroma and taste of liqueurs, wines and brandies. The leaves contain rutin, mucilage, volatile oils such as limonene and diosphenol (or barosma camphor) also menthone, quercetin, quercetrin, hesperidin, <b>alpha-pinene,</b> calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, silicon, zinc, vitamin B1, B2, B3 and vitamin C.|$|E
50|$|Essential oils {{have been}} found in the fruits and in the leaves. The oil of leaves, unripe and ripe fruits differ in {{compounds}}. 50 compounds were identified in the oil of unripe fruits, 51 compounds in the oil of ripe fruits and 46 compounds in the oil of the leaves. 1,8-cineole and sabinene are the main monoterpene components and beta-caryophyllene is the major sesquiterpene compound found in the fruits of Vitex agnus-castus. Other important chemical compounds are: limonene, alpha- and beta-pinene, trans-beta-farnesene. There are some slight differences between fruits from white flowering plants and such from violet flowering ones. The oil of fruits of white flowering plants have a higher amount of monoterpene constituents. The content of mono- and sesquiterpene was nearly the same for both oils. The leaves mainly contain 1,8-cineole, trans-beta-farnesene, <b>alpha-pinene,</b> trans-beta-caryophyllene and terpine-4-ol. All essential oils found in Vitex agnus-castus have an antimicrobial effect. Antifungal effects are slightly higher compared to antibacterial effects. Antibacterial activity is higher in oils coming from white flowering plants than from such of violet flowering plants.|$|E
5000|$|Besides {{biogenic}} vapours {{produced by}} plants, another class of trace vapours, amines {{have been shown}} by CLOUD to cluster with sulphuric acid to produce new aerosol particles in the atmosphere. These are found close to their primary sources, e.g. animal husbandry, while <b>alpha-pinene</b> is generally found over landmasses. The experiments show that sulfuric acid and oxidized organic vapors at low concentrations reproduce suitable particle nucleation rates. The nucleation mechanism used on global aerosol models yields a photochemically and biologically driven seasonal cycle of particle concentrations and cloud formation in good agreement with observations. CLOUD insofar allows to explain a large fraction of cloud seeds in the lower atmosphere involving sulphuric acid and biogenic aerosols. CLOUD researchers note that cosmic rays have little influence on the formation of sulphuric acid-amine particle formation: [...] "The ion-induced contribution is generally small, reflecting the high stability of sulphuric acid-dimethylamine clusters and indicating that galactic cosmic rays exert only a small influence on their formation, except at low overall formation rates." [...] This result {{does not support the}} hypothesis that cosmic rays significantly affect climate, although a CERN press release states that neither does it [...] "rule out a role for cosmic radiation" [...] in climate.|$|E
50|$|Stereocontrolled 1,2-additions to {{carbonyl}} groups (especially ketones) are {{an important}} class of reactions because they provide access to substituted alcohols, generating a new stereocenter in the process. Especially widespread are various reagents for stereocontrolled 1,2-hydride additions (or reductions) of ketones. A well-known method to synthesize enantiopure alcohols by ketone reduction is the Midland Alpine borane reduction, named after its inventor Professor M. Mark Midland. The strategy uses a chiral organoborane, derived from the hydroboration of <b>alpha-pinene</b> by 9-BBN, to differentiate enantiotopic faces of a ketone. Following workup with basic hydrogen peroxide, the product alcohols can be obtained, often with high degrees of enantioselectivity. The reaction works best {{if one of the}} ketone groups has low steric hindrance, such as an alkyne or nitrile. Another method, first developed in the 1980s, is called the CBS (Corey-Bakshi-Shibata) reduction, and it features the use of an oxazaborolidine catalyst along with borane as a reducing agent for accomplishing enantioselective ketone reductions. The CBS reduction has been used extensively by chemists en route to synthesizing a wide variety of natural products, including alkaloids, terpenoids, pheromones, and biotins. Fig. 1 shows an example of a diastereoselective CBS reduction being used to prepare a complex macrocyclic alcohol en route to the synthesis of 11-desmethyllaulimalide (an analog of the antitumor agent laulimalide). The authors noted that CBS reduction was much more effective than using either lithium tert-butoxyaluminum hydride or L-Selectride. The CBS catalyst, usually prepared from diphenylprolinol, often can be used in low catalyst loadings, even as low as 2%.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>alpha-Pinene</b> is an {{important}} natural product that is widely used in flavorings, fragrances, medicines, fine chemicals and high-density renewable fuels. Currently, <b>alpha-Pinene</b> used in industry is mainly produced either by tapping trees (gum turpentine) or as a byproduct of paper pulping (crude sulfate turpentine, CST). However, the extraction of it from trees is tedious and inefficient and requires substantial expenditure of natural resources.

40|$|Over 20 gram-positive {{bacteria}} {{were isolated}} by elective culture with (+/-) -alpha-pinene {{as the sole}} carbon source. One of these strains, Nocardia sp. strain P 18. 3, was selected for detailed study. alpha-Pinene-grown cells oxidized, without lag, <b>alpha-pinene,</b> <b>alpha-pinene</b> oxide (epoxide), and the cis and trans isomers of 2 -methyl- 5 -isopropylhexa- 2, 5 -dienal. No other tested terpene was oxidized at a significant rate. <b>alpha-Pinene</b> was not metabolized by cell extracts in {{the presence or absence}} of NADH or NADPH. Cell extracts catalyzed a rapid decyclization of <b>alpha-pinene</b> oxide, in the absence of added cofactors, with the formation of cis- 2 -methyl- 5 -isopropylhexa- 2, 5 -dienal. Further oxidation of the aldehyde to the corresponding acid occurred in the presence of NAD. Both activities were induced by growth with <b>alpha-pinene.</b> A rapid, nonenzymic transformation of the cis aldehyde into the trans isomer occurred in glycine buffer. The trans isomer was also a substrate for the NAD-linked aldehyde dehydrogenase. The distribution of the <b>alpha-pinene</b> oxide lyase in alpha-pinene-utilizing Pseudomonas spp. was also investigated and was compatible with the two alternative ring-cleavage sequences that have been proposed on the basis of accumulated metabolites...|$|E
