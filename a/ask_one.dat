5|$|Reviews {{were mixed}} for the episode. While Will's actual {{proposal}} to Emma was received with more favor than not, {{the scene where}} Will asks Finn (Cory Monteith) to be his best man was roundly condemned: the notion that Will had no adult friends and would <b>ask</b> <b>one</b> of his students was inconceivable to many. There was acclaim for the subplot featuring Becky's (Lauren Potter) pursuit of Artie (Kevin McHale), and her mental voiceovers by Helen Mirren.|$|E

If the wife does not ask the questions, the leader of the seder asks them. And even two scholars who know the laws of Passover must <b>ask</b> <b>one</b> another (if no one else can ask).|$|E
25|$|To {{some people}} the golden era of Hip Hop was ’94.

Whatever the case these {{so-called}} golden eras weren’t only defined by the music or the fashion - they were characterised by something less tangible - an atmosphere, a movement.|$|E

If a team has buzzed in prior the buzzer sounding, the team is required {{to answer the question}} before the game is considered over.

He was permitted to <b>ask</b> <b>one</b> question, of Voorhis, and the evening ended. According to Bullock, [...] "the magnitude of Nixon's triumph did not immediately dawn on us."

500|$|In December 1983, Jerôme Dahan and Laurent Boutonnat, two friends, {{composed}} {{a song called}} [...] "Maman a tort", about lesbian love between a girl committed to a mental hospital and her nurse. To find a performer, they held a casting. A girl aged 15–16 was initially chosen to perform the song, before being rejected because she {{was too young to}} sing its sexually ambiguous lyrics. Boutonnat then decided to <b>ask</b> <b>one</b> of his friends, Mylène Gautier, to sing the track. Both composers have said that they thought Gautier seemed psychotic and thus was the ideal person to record the track. Boutonnat said: [...] "As soon as I saw her, with her triangular face, I realized that this would be her and nobody else. She looked crazy, it was perfect." [...] After they decided to work with her, Gautier took the pseudonym of Farmer, as a tribute to actress Frances Farmer.|$|E
500|$|The Æsir {{begin to}} grow grey and {{old at the}} {{disappearance}} of Idunn. The Æsir assemble at a thing where they <b>ask</b> <b>one</b> another when Iðunn had been seen last. The Æsir realize that {{the last time that}} Iðunn was seen was when she was going outside of Asgard with Loki, and so they have Loki arrested and brought to the thing. Loki is threatened with death and torture. Terrified, Loki says that if the goddess Freyja will lend him her [...] "falcon shape" [...] he will search for Iðunn in the land of Jötunheimr. Freyja lends the falcon shape to Loki, and with it he flies north to Jötunheimr. One day later, Loki arrives at Þjazi's home. There he finds that Þjazi is out at sea in a boat, and that Iðunn is home alone. Loki turns her into a nut, holds her in his claws, and flies away with her as fast as possible.|$|E
2500|$|Mou {{makes an}} {{important}} distinction between Confucianism and Christianity: the latter does not <b>ask</b> <b>one</b> to become a Christ, because the nature of Christ is unreachable for ordinary humans, who lack divinity; by contrast, in Confucianism, sages who have realised Tian teach to others how to become sages and worthy, as Heaven is inherent in everyone. Mou defines Confucianism as a [...] "religion of morality", a religion [...] "of fulfillment of virtues", whose meaning lies in seeking the infinite and complete in finite life.|$|E

2500|$|The {{alternate}} Greek {{name for}} Zoroaster was Zaratras. or Zaratas/Zaradas/Zaratos,) Pythagoreans considered the mathematicians to have studied with Zoroaster in Babylonia. Lydus, in On the Months, attributes {{the creation of}} the seven-day week to [...] "the Babylonians in the circle of Zoroaster and Hystaspes," [...] and who did so because there were seven planets. The Suda's chapter on astronomia notes that the Babylonians learned their astrology from Zoroaster. Lucian of Samosata, in Mennipus 6, reports deciding to journey to Babylon [...] "to <b>ask</b> <b>one</b> of the magi, Zoroaster's disciples and successors," [...] for their opinion.|$|E
2500|$|Although Canada {{achieved}} full {{status as}} a sovereign nation in the Statute of Westminster 1931, there was no consensus about how to amend the constitution; attempts such as the 1965 Fulton–Favreau formula and the 1971 Victoria Charter failed to receive unanimous approval from both levels of government. When negotiations with the provinces again stalled in 1982, Trudeau threatened {{to take the case}} for patriation to the British parliament [...] " [...] bothering to <b>ask</b> <b>one</b> premier". According to the federal cabinet and Crown counsel, if the British Crown (in council, parliament and on the bench) exercised sovereignty over Canada, it would do so only {{at the request of the}} federal ministers.|$|E
2500|$|During a {{physical}} examination {{to check for}} MG, a doctor might ask the person to perform repetitive movements. For instance, the doctor may <b>ask</b> <b>one</b> {{to look at a}} fixed point for 30 seconds and to relax the muscles of the forehead. This is done because a person with MG and ptosis of the eyes might be involuntarily using the forehead muscles to compensate for the weakness in the eyelids. The clinical examiner might also try to elicit the [...] "curtain sign" [...] in a patient by holding one of the person's eyes open, which in the case of MG will lead the other eye to close.|$|E

2500|$|Trudeau {{rejected}} the proposed document {{out of hand}} and again threatened {{to take the case}} for patriation straight to the British parliament [...] " [...] bothering to <b>ask</b> <b>one</b> premier." [...] The federal Cabinet and Crown counsel took the position that if the British Crown—in council, parliament, and on the bench—was to exercise its residual sovereignty over Canada, it did so {{at the request of the}} federal ministers of the Crown only. The gang soon appealed to the courts. Justice Joseph O'Sullivan of the Manitoba Court of Appeal found that the federal government's position was incorrect; the constitutionally entrenched principle of responsible government meant that neither the Queen of Canada nor the Queen of the United Kingdom could legislate for the provinces (i.e. alter their constitutions) only on the advice of Canadian federal ministers; [...] "Canada had not one responsible government but eleven." [...] Judges, however, were not unanimous in their conclusions on the matter. Further, officials in the United Kingdom indicated that the British parliament was under no obligation to fulfill any request for legal changes made by Trudeau, particularly if Canadian convention was not being followed. The case was eventually presented to the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 November, al-Husseini met the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and {{was officially}} {{received}} by Adolf Hitler on 28 November. He asked Adolf Hitler {{for a public}} declaration that 'recognized and sympathized with the Arab struggles for independence and liberation, and that would support the elimination of a national Jewish homeland'. Hitler refused {{to make such a}} public announcement, saying that it would strengthen the Gaullists against the Vichy France, but asked al-Husseini 'to lock ...deep in his heart' the following points, which Christopher Browning summarizes as follows, that ‘Germany has resolved, step by step, to <b>ask</b> <b>one</b> European nation after the other to solve its Jewish problem, and at the proper time, direct a similar appeal to non-European nations as well'. When Germany had defeated Russia and broken through the Caucasus into the Middle East, it would have no further imperial goals of its own and would support Arab liberation... But Hitler did have one goal. [...] "Germany’s objective would then be solely the destruction of the Jewish element residing in the Arab sphere under the protection of British power". (Das deutsche Ziel würde dann lediglich die Vernichtung des im arabischen Raum unter der Protektion der britischen Macht lebenden Judentums sein). In short, Jews were not simply to be driven out of the German sphere but would be hunted down and destroyed even beyond it.’ ...|$|E
