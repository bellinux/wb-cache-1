50|$|The noted British {{biologist}} Brian J. Ford used to {{live and}} write at Swanbridge and explored Sully Island frequently. He also carried out extensive ecological studies, while surveying and mapping both the island and the foreshore. Ford recorded many plants unusual for the area, including the bee orchid, the marine spleenwort and the <b>adder's</b> <b>tongue</b> <b>fern.</b>|$|R
50|$|James Forrest of Mid Lambroughton was a noted {{botanist}} and {{he recorded}} the rare <b>Adder's</b> <b>tongue</b> <b>Fern</b> in the Swinzie Burn glen at Robertland in the 1920s. The Stewarton Flower, so named {{due to its}} local abundance and recorded as such by the Kilmarnock Glenfield Ramblers, is otherwise known as Pink Purslane (Claytonia sibirica), found in damp areas. The plant was introduced from its native North America, quite possibly at the Robertland Estate.|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} {{chromosomes}} in the karyotype between (relatively) unrelated species is hugely variable. The low record {{is held by}} the nematode Parascaris univalens, where the haploid n = 1; and an ant: Myrmecia pilosula. The high record would be somewhere amongst the <b>ferns,</b> with the <b>adder's</b> <b>tongue</b> <b>fern</b> Ophioglossum ahead {{with an average of}} 1262 chromosomes. Top score for animals might be the shortnose sturgeon Acipenser brevirostrum at 372 chromosomes. The existence of supernumerary or B chromosomes means that chromosome number can vary even within one interbreeding population; and aneuploids are another example, though in this case they would not be regarded as normal members of the population.|$|R

40|$|Ferns {{are a very}} divers group exhibiting various habits (e. g. aquatic, epiphytic, herbaceous, arborescents), and {{together}} with the group of lycophytes, represent the oldest lineages of vascular plants among the terrestrial plants. Despite its ancient origin, this lineage accounts with much more extant species (~ 11. 000) than the more derived gymnosperms (< 1. 000 species). In recent classifications of land plants, vascular plants have a basal dichotomy separating the lycophytes (vascular plants presenting lycophylls or leaves with an intercalary meristem, without leaf gaps and a single medium vein), from the euphyllophytes (vascular plants presenting euphylls or leaves with marginal or apical meristems and an associated leaf gap in the vascular stele and branched veins). This dichotomy occurred in the early-mid Devo-nian, ca. 400 million years ago (Stewart & Rothwell 1993, Kenrick & Crane 1997, Pryer et al. 2004). Within the euphyllophytes, two signif icant clades diverged from a common ancestor thought to be within the extinct Trimerophytes group (Bateman et al. 1988, Stewart & Rothwell 1993) : spermatophytes (seed plants com-prising the extant gymnosperms and angiosperms and few extinct groups, being the Pteridosperms the most pro-minent one) and monilophytes (ferns sensu stricto). Lyco-phytes and monilophytes are all seed-free, and because of this, historically they have been considered together under various terms, such as: “pteridophytes ” (ferns sensu lato) and “ferns and ferns allies ” (Smith et al. 2006). The monilophytes comprise four extant lineages (Fig. 1) : leptosporangiate ferns, marattioid <b>ferns,</b> psilo-phytes (<b>adder’s</b> <b>tongue</b> <b>ferns,</b> moonworts, and whisk fern...|$|R

40|$|Successful {{transplantation}} of a hart’s <b>tongue</b> <b>fern</b> population (Asplenium scolopendrium L.) {{with ten}} years of monitoring – Thomas Becker and Ute Becker – At {{the edge of the}} Harz Mountains in Lower Saxony a population of the hart’s <b>tongue</b> <b>fern</b> (Asplenium scolopendrium) threatened by destruction by a gypsum quarry were transplanted into a dolina which was not populated by the species at that time, and the new population was followed over ten years. 90 % of the 59 transplanted plants survived this period and grew larger during the first six years after trans-plantation. Progenies appeared in the third year after transplantation. Nowadays, in the tenth year after transplantation, there are 1110 progenies, 171 of which are reproducing. Overall, the population increased by 1781 % in the ten years. Plants that were planted on a rocky slope or a boulder heap in the new habitat, where soil was available, grew better than plants in rock faces without soil. In contrast, in the rock faces, where substrate was not covered with autumn foliage, more juveniles established. The distance between juveniles and mother plants rarely exceeded three meters, which indicates a limited dispersal potential of the hart’s <b>tongue</b> <b>fern</b> and may explain together with low diaspore pressure as...|$|R
