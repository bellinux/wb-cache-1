40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the {{decisions on the}} reform of the CAP from June 2003. The decisions focus on the decoupling of the direct payments to farmers from production. This will reduce production incentives and thereby improve the allocation of resources. However, payments to farmers will hardly be reduced in total but rather partly be redirected towards rural development policies, environmental policies and <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>measures.</b> Since a consistent rationale for permanent payments to farmers is missing, payments should be stopped completely. The increase of financial support for rural development is the wrong way, since most measures, again, are interventions in favour of farmers.

40|$|This study {{examines}} Japanese retail price {{reactions to the}} 2001 bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) discovery, the 2000 outbreak of {{foot and mouth disease}} (FMD), and the 1996 E. coli food poisoning events. Historical decomposition of retail-level price series aids in explaining the behavior of beef prices in a neighborhood (period-by-period time interval) of the three events. This is based on an application of directed acyclic graphs, constructing orthogonal innovations to determine causal patterns behind contemporaneous innovations. The results show that the beef safety and animal health events had different negative impacts on Japanese retail beef prices, suggesting that consumers understood and differentiated among the health risks. The results provide incentives for beef producers and retailers to inform consumers proactively about ongoing beef safety and <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>measures.</b> Understanding consumer reaction to BSE, FMD, and E. coli helps the beef industry restore consumer confidence after future crises, and provides policy makers a basis for countermeasures and compensations.

40|$|The {{expertise}} {{and knowledge of}} veterinary advisors on improving <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> management is key towards a better herd health status. However, veterinary advisors are not always aware of the goals and priorities of dairy farmers. To dairy farmers <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> is {{only one aspect of}} farm management and resources may be allocated to other more preferred areas. Veterinary advisors may experience this as non-compliant with their advice. To explore the preferences of European Union (EU) organic dairy farmers for improved <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> management relative to other farm management areas an adaptive conjoint analysis (ACA) was performed. A total of 215 farmers participated originating from organic dairy farms in France (n= 70), Germany (n= 60), Spain (n= 28) and Sweden (n= 57). The management areas udder health and claw <b>health</b> represented <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> management whereas barn, calf and pasture management represented potential conflicting management areas. Results indicate that EU organic dairy farmers differ in their preferences for improved <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> management within the farming system. In general, improved calf management was the most preferred area and improved claw health management was found to be least preferred, the remaining areas were of intermediate interest. Cluster analyses on claw <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> and udder <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> resulted in respectively seven and nine distinct preference profiles. The results indicate a high degree of variation in farmers’ preference, which cannot be explained by the typical herd characteristics. With the individual preferences revealed by ACA, a veterinary advisor can now find out whether his intended advice is directed at a favourable or unfavourable management area of the farmer. If the latter is the case the veterinarian should first create awareness of the problem to the farmer. Insights in individual farmers preferences will allow veterinary advisors to better understand why farmers were incompliant with their advice and improve their advice by showing, for example, the potential benefits of their advice...|$|R

The poor coverage of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information on the web emanates from many factors: poor ICT (Information Communications Technology) infrastructure in many African countries, lack of ICT literacy, awareness and mindset, lack of recognition of all the values of information services, poor state of African indexing and abstracting services, inadequate funds, and perceived misconceptions of actual causes of the problem.

It was also asked to assess any new evidence on possible public health risks related to CWD. A 3 -year surveillance system is proposed, differing for farmed and wild or semidomesticated cervids, with a two-stage sampling programme at the farm/geographically based population unit level (random sampling) and individual level (convenience sampling targeting high-risk animals). The current derogations of Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016 / 1918 present a risk of introduction of CWD into the EU. Measures {{to prevent the spread of}} CWD within the EU are dependent upon the assumption that the disease is already present; this is currently unknown. The measures listed are intended to contain (limit the geographic extent of a focus) and/or to control (actively stabilise/reduce infection rates in an affected herd or population) the disease where it occurs. With regard to the zoonotic potential, the human species barrier for CWD prions does not appear to be absolute.

It then questions if the current allocation of scarce resources for <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> are adequately allocated for societies and whether currently available data are sufficient for good allocation. A rapid review of the data on disease impacts - production losses and costs of human reaction - indicate that the data are sparse collected in different times and geographical regions.
