5|$|In a wind farm, {{individual}} turbines are interconnected with {{a medium}} voltage (usually 34.5 kV) {{power collection system}} and communications network. At a substation, this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with <b>a</b> <b>transformer</b> for connection to the high voltage electric power transmission system.|$|E
5|$|Further inland, {{moisture}} from Bonnie {{combined with a}} cold front to produce widespread thunderstorms over Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee. In Arkansas, lightning from a severe thunderstorm knocked out power {{to much of the}} city of Rison after striking <b>a</b> <b>transformer.</b> Significant wind damage took place in Dallas County where awnings were blown off homes, structures sustained roof damage, and trees were felled. Heavy rains also triggered localized flash flooding, covering several highways. Throughout the state, storm damage was estimated at $356,000 (2010USD).|$|E
5|$|In a wind farm, {{individual}} turbines are interconnected with {{a medium}} voltage (often 34.5 kV), {{power collection system}} and communications network. In general, a distance of 7D (7 × Rotor Diameter of the Wind Turbine) is set between each turbine in a fully developed wind farm. At a substation, this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with <b>a</b> <b>transformer</b> for connection to the high voltage electric power transmission system.|$|E

5|$|The show on June 14, 2002 at the United Spirit Arena in Lubbock, Texas was {{cancelled}} due to <b>a</b> <b>transformer</b> {{blowing out}} during the 2nd song which put the whole show on auxiliary power making it unsafe for Spears and the entire production team to continue. The show initially {{was going to be}} rescheduled according to the band member and DJ, Skip, but it later fell through.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Soundwave assembles a newer, more {{powerful}} chassis for Megatron, {{using it to}} resurrect him. Megatron then challenges Starscream and his loyalists for leadership of the Decepticons, kills his soldiers, defeats him and frees the Combaticons. He then leads a full-scale assault on the Autobot stronghold {{in the ruins of}} Iacon, where the massive Decepticon Trypticon's remains are kept. Megatron and his soldiers invade the facility and he takes Trypticon's power core, the heart of <b>a</b> <b>transformer.</b> He informs Trypticon that he is not being rescued as he , but he congratulates him for destroying Iacon City and thousands more Autobots. Trypticon is then transformed into the Nemesis, the Decepticon flagship.|$|E
5|$|Now activated, Omega Supreme pursues Megatron and his minions relentlessly. Megatron, Soundwave and Breakdown {{devise a}} plan to lure Omega Supreme to a rooftop defended with turrets, where the giant Transformer is ambushed. Omega Supreme sustains heavy damage and plummets to Cybertron's lower levels. The Decepticons follow Omega Supreme and engage him in a lengthy final battle, in which Omega Supreme is finally defeated, {{infected}} with Dark Energon, and captured by the Decepticons. Megatron forces Omega Supreme {{to open the door}} to Cybertron's core and travels there with his minions. Upon arrival he infects the core of Cybertron, also <b>a</b> <b>Transformer,</b> with Dark Energon, which then begins to spread over the entire planet.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} produced {{heavy rainfall}} along the coastline, including {{a total of}} 19.1inches (486mm) measured in a 48‑hour period in Acapulco. Totals of over 2inches (50mm) spread across much of Guerrero and Oaxaca, causing flash flooding and mudslides. The storm partially flooded about 40houses, {{and a total of}} 72people were forced to leave their homes. In Acapulco, floodwaters washed trash from street corners onto the beaches. Elsewhere in Guerrero, the flooding and mudslides blocked several highways, which stranded dozens of vehicles. The wall of a prison collapsed due to the rainfall. Also in Acapulco, the rainfall downed trees and power lines, causing power outages and sparking a fire when <b>a</b> <b>transformer</b> exploded. No deaths were reported.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Rutherford {{had succeeded}} in {{disintegrating}} nitrogen atoms with alpha particles emitted from decaying radium atoms. This and subsequent experiments hinted at the structure of atomic nuclei. To explore it further, he needed an artificial means of creating particles with a velocity high enough to overcome the charge of the nucleus. This opened {{a new line of}} research at the Cavendish Laboratory. He assigned Cockcroft, Thomas Allibone and Ernest Walton to the problem. They built what became known as a Cockcroft–Walton accelerator. Mark Oliphant designed a proton source for them. A crucial moment came when Cockcroft read a paper by George Gamow on quantum tunnelling. Cockcroft realised {{that as a result of}} this phenomenon, the desired effect could be achieved with much lower voltages than first thought. In fact, he calculated that protons with energy of just 300,000 electronvolts would be able to penetrate a boron nucleus. Cockcroft and Walton worked on their accelerator for the next two years. Rutherford obtained a £1,000 grant from the University of Cambridge for them to buy <b>a</b> <b>transformer</b> and other equipment they needed.|$|E
5|$|The Decepticon {{scientist}} Shockwave {{begins the}} secretive Operation: Regenesis — seeding Energon on various planets, including Earth. While stabilizing Earth's seeding, the Dynobots attack Shockwave, {{and they are}} all buried in molten lava for thousands of years. Bludgeon is assigned by Megatron to investigate Operation: Regenesis and Soundwave is told to spy on him. In 1984, Soundwave learns to his horror that Bludgeon intends to use the Ultra-Energon on Earth to re-animate Thunderwing, but is silenced and put into stasis-lock in his cassette player mode. The following year, an organization named Skywatch find Laserbeak and Ravage's bodies. Starscream and his unit later come to Earth, discover Shockwave's Energon and mine it in Nebraska. When they exhaust this supply in 2006, they move to Oregon, entering siege mode to protect their discovery. As part of their plan to acquire <b>a</b> <b>Transformer,</b> an agent working for the Machination takes a photo of a Decepticon transforming and locates the original Decepticon base. As a response he is targeted and killed by Thundercracker, Runabout and Runamuck. Before his death, his laptop with the photo is stolen by a girl named Verity Carlo and she is taken to the Autobots - inadvertently leading the Machination straight to them via a homing device in the laptop.|$|E

5000|$|Like any <b>transformer,</b> <b>a</b> current <b>transformer</b> has <b>a</b> primary winding, a {{core and}} a {{secondary}} winding, although some transformers, including current <b>transformers,</b> use <b>an</b> air core. In principle, {{the only difference}} between <b>a</b> current <b>transformer</b> and <b>a</b> voltage <b>transformer</b> (normal type) is that the former is fed with a 'constant' current while the latter is fed with a 'constant' voltage, where 'constant' has the strict circuit theory meaning.|$|R
