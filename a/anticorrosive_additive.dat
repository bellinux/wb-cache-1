40|$|Problems {{related to}} the {{combustion}} of heavy oils with high vanadium contents in a highcapacity steam boiler have been analyzed. In this study, two types of additives have been tested both to diminish high-temperature corrosion and to obtain more brittle deposits. Results show that heavy fuel oil can be suitably burned {{in this type of}} boilers if it is chemically treated with an <b>anticorrosive</b> <b>additive.</b> In this research, the best results have been obtained when the heavy fuel oil was mixed with an organometallic additive. The influence of fouling on the behavior of some operational parameters such as the pressure in furnace and pressure drop in superheaters and pipe metal temperature, among others, has been verified. It is concluded that monitoring of these parameters can provide direct information on the degree of fouling, {{as well as of the}} effectiveness of the treatment during normal boiler operational conditions. Some other improvements in the atomization and combustion processes due to the use of the organometallic additive have also been observed. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|An alkyd {{formulation}} containing {{zinc phosphate}} (10 wt. %) was prepared and subsequently modified replacing the latter <b>anticorrosive</b> <b>additive</b> {{by a very}} low concentration of conducting polymer. Specifically, three modified paints, which contain polyaniline emeraldine base (undoped form), polyaniline emeraldine salt (doped form) and an eco-friendly polythiophene derivative (partially oxidized), were formulated. The properties and corrosion resistance of the four alkyd coatings have been characterized. Among the three modified paints, the one containing polythiophene shows the best adherence and the highest corrosion resistance. This {{has been attributed to}} the fact that the miscibility of the polythiophene derivative with the alkyd formulation is better than that of polyaniline. Furthermore, accelerated corrosion assays and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements revealed that the corrosion resistance of the paint with polythiophene is several orders of magnitude higher than that with zinc phosphate. The polythiophene derivative has been found to induce the formation of a passivating and well-adhered layer between the coating and the surface, preventing the access of chloride anions and oxygen to the substrate.

40|$|Humidifiers {{are used}} in {{buildings}} to maintain humidity levels to ensure quality and handling capabilities in manufacturing processes, to lower the transmission rate of disease-causing bacteria in hospitals, to reduce static electricity in manufacturing clean rooms and in computer rooms, and to provide higher levels of employee comfort in offices. Ultrasonic humidifiers generate a water mist without raising its temperature. An electronic oscillation is converted to a mechanical oscillation using a piezo disk immersed in a reservoir of mineral-free water. The mechanical oscillation is directed at {{the surface of the}} water, where at very high frequencies it creates a very fine mist of water droplets. This adiabatic process, which does not heat the supply water, reduces humidifier energy use by 90 to 93 % compared with systems that do boil the water. Ultrasonic humidifiers have been demonstrated to be more efficient and to require less maintenance than competing humidifier technologies such as electrode canisters, quartz lamps, and indirect steam-to-steam. They do not require <b>anticorrosive</b> <b>additives</b> that affect the indoor air quality of buildings using direct steam humidifiers. There are two potential disadvantages of ultrasonic humidifiers. They must use mineral-free, deionized water or water treated with reverse osmosis. Treated water reduces maintenance costs because it eliminates calcium deposits, but increases other operating costs. Also, the cool mist from ultrasonic humidifiers absorbs energy from the supply air as it evaporates and provides a secondary cooling effect...|$|R
40|$|This study {{elucidates}} {{the effect}} of zinc (Zn), which is an <b>anticorrosive</b> water <b>additive,</b> on the formation of silica scales from cooling water. In these experiments, the silica scales were analyzed by EPMA, and {{the results indicate that}} Zn is sorbed into the silica scales during formation. Measurements of the solubility of Zn(OH) _ 2 at various concentrations of silicic acid demonstrate that Zn is present as a silicato complex of Zn (SCZ) in cooling water. From adsorption experiments of the SCZ on silica and alumina, which are major components of the silica scales, it can be concluded that the SCZ accelerates the formation of silica scales from cooling water...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{coatings}} play {{a prominent}} economical role for protection of steel against corrosion. The driving forces {{for the development}} and application of water based coatings for corrosion protection are the challenges of increasing environmental requirements and the compliance with legislative regulations. In terms of these requirements, anti-corrosive coatings, based on polymer dispersions, e. g. acrylates and acrylate co-polymers, may offer best preconditions since they have further advantages concerning toxicity and work hygiene. Up to now polymer dispersions show intrinsic weaknesses in anti-corrosive behaviour. Especially in contrast to coatings, based on two-pack EP binders, coatings with polymer dispersions reveal low performance under salt spray conditions, according to corrosivity categories {{greater than or equal}} to C 3. One objective of this study is the search for the causes of these weaknesses, in order to find out principles or criteria for selecting polymer dispersions with a high anticorrosive potential for coatings. The other approach is to study specific contributions and synergies of fillers and <b>anticorrosive</b> pigments. Functional <b>additives</b> and their structure/property-relationships with polymer dispersions for significantly improving the barrier properties of coatings are studied as well. Derived from the frequently occurring failure modes, i. e. blistering and undercreepage due to cathodic delamination, another focus of this work is on the question, how to block the pathways for water, electrolytes and oxygen through the coating film and along the interface between coating film and steel surface, to improve the lateral barrier against cathodic delamination. This could be done via means of better modelling of the polymer to/on the steel surface topography. Also under consideration is the role of electrolytes, trapped as traces in polymer films, as an inherent weakness of polymer dispersions, originating from the polymerization process. Within this work a screening with over ten different polymer dispersions, based on styrene acrylates, formulated in three variants, is performed. The formulated coatings are applied to blasted steel surfaces. After standardized drying, the coated samples are tested with standard short-time corrosion tests, under salt spray and condensation-water atmosphere. The undercreepage on defined scribes, respectively the extent of blistering on the coating surface, were evaluated as a function of polymer dispersion type, pigmentation, anticorrosion pigment, film thickness, and single or two layer systems. Studies of water and electrolyte penetration through the polymer film to and along the interfaces between steel and organic coating with EIS, SKP and sorption kinetics measurements will give insights into the start, progress and extent of the corrosion process and are a measure for the estimation of the corrosion protection performance of the system. These results can help to identify the main factors of polymer dispersions influencing the anti-corrosion properties of coatings, and, in addition, important indications for paint producers and suppliers of polymer dispersions can be derived...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{resistance}} against corrosion of a marine epoxy primer modified with Zn- 3 (PO 4) (2) (10 wt%) {{or a small}} concentration (0. 3 wt%) of conducting polymer (CP) as inorganic or organic anticorrosive pigment, respectively. More specifically, the behavior of three different CPs has been evaluated: polyaniline (PAni) emeraldine base, poly(3 -thiophen- 3 -yl-acrylic acid methyl ester) and poly(2 -thiophen- 3 -yl-malonic acid dimethyl ester), the latter two being soluble polythiophene (PTh) derivatives bearing carboxylate side groups. In a first stage, the structural, thermal, and mechanical properties of all the modified epoxy coatings were characterized using infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analyses and stress-strain assays, respectively. After this, accelerated corrosion assays have evidenced {{that the degree of}} protection imparted by a small concentration of PAni is higher than that obtained using 10 wt% of Zn- 3 (PO 4) (2). Indeed, PAni {{has been found to be}} more effective as <b>anticorrosive</b> <b>additive</b> than the two PTh derivatives. This fact has been attributed to the electroactivity of the former, which is higher than that of the latter. Thus, the ability to store charge has been proposed to be also responsible of protection against corrosion imparted by organic additives, based on CPs.

Neste sentido este trabalho descreve o desenvolvimento e estudo de tintas ecologicamente corretas formuladas usando fosfato de zinco (ZP), molibdato de zinco (ZM), molibdato de zinco e cÃlcio (ZCM), fosfomolibdato de zinco (ZMP) e fosfomolibdato de zinco e cÃlcio (ZCMP), como alternativas seguras aos pigmentos anticorrosivos tradicionais (chumbo, cromo e outros metais pesados). Adicionalmente, consideraÃÃes ambientais tÃm limitado o uso de tintas organossolÃveis devido estas contribuÃrem para a poluiÃÃo atmosfÃrica e problemas de saÃde. Assim, resinas epÃxis hidrossolÃveis foram usadas na formulaÃÃo das tintas epÃxis anticorrosivas. O {{principal}} objetivo deste trabalho Ã empregar pigmentos de molibdatos para avaliar sua eficiÃncia contra corrosÃo em tintas hidrossolÃveis. As propriedades inibidoras dos pigmentos foram avaliadas por curvas de polarizaÃÃo potenciodinÃmica, monitoramento do potencial de circuito aberto e perda de massa por imersÃo de substratos ferrosos (SAE 1010) em soluÃÃo saturada dos pigmentos em 10 - 2 mol dm- 3 NaCl. A caracterizaÃÃo fÃsico-quÃmica dos produtos de corrosÃo foi avaliada por microscopia eletrÃnica de varredura, energia dispersiva de raios-X e difraÃÃo de raios-X. Todos os testes mostraram que os pigmentos fosfomolibdatos apresentaram as melhores propriedades inibidoras de corrosÃo. Todas as tintas foram formuladas com 16 % (v/v) de resina epÃxi, 7, 5 % (v/v) de pigmentos anticorrosivos, e demais componentes e aditivos para manter a relaÃÃo de PVC/CPVC em 0, 8. A espessura da pelÃcula seca de tinta nos painÃis ficou em aproximadamente 120 &# 956;m. O desempenho das tintas foi monitorado por impedÃncia eletroquÃmica durante os testes de imersÃo, de exposiÃÃo atmosfÃrica e de cÃmara acelerado de nÃvoa salina. A estabilidade tÃrmica foi estudada por anÃlise tÃrmica e calorimetria exploratÃria diferencial. Os diagramas de impedÃncia de todas as tintas mostraram somente um arco capacitivo, com os valores de impedÃncia maiores que 109 &# 937;cm 2. os valores de capacitÃncia variaram entre 10 - 6 e 10 - 10 Fcm- 2. Os resultados sugerem que a combinaÃÃo do molibdato e fosfato fornecem as melhores propriedades inibidoras Ãs tintas. Em relaÃÃo Ãs anÃlises tÃrmicas foi possÃvel concluir que os pigmentos de molibdatos e fosfomolibdatos apresentaram o melhor desempenho tanto em relaÃÃo Ã estabilidade tÃrmica da resina epÃxi, uma vez que estes pigmentos mostraram maior interaÃÃo entre pigmento-resina, assim como em relaÃÃo Ã energia envolvida no processo de cura do filme polimÃrico, pois estes pigmentos demonstraram que contribuem para a diminuiÃÃo do calor envolvido no processo de cura. This work {{describes the}} development and study of environmental friendly epoxies anticorrosives paints, which were formulated using zinc phosphate (ZP), zinc molybdate (ZM), zinc and calcium molybdate (ZCM), zinc phosphomolybdate (ZMP) and zinc and calcium phosphomolybdate (MZAP), as safe alternative to more traditional anticorrosive pigments (lead, chromium and other heavy metals). Additionally, environmental considerations are limiting the use of solvent-borne paints because it contibutes to atmospheric pollution and empairs health problems. Thus, hydrosoluble epoxy resin {{was used in the}} formulation of the water-borne paints. The aim od this research is to employ molybdate-based pigments in order to check their efficiency in water borne paints. Inhibitive properties of the pigments were evaluated by potentiodynamic polarization curves, open ciricuit potential (Eoc) and mass loss monitoring during 30 days in immersion test of SAE 1010 steel in aqueous saturated pigment solutions with 10 - 2 mol dm- 3 NaCl. The physical chemical characterization of the corrosion products was carried out by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray and X-ray diffraction techniques. All the tests showed that the phosphomolybdate pigments presented the better corrosion inhibiting properties. All the paints were formulated with 16 % (v/v) epoxy resin, 7. 5 % (v/v) <b>anticorrosive</b> pigment, and <b>additives</b> and fillers {{in order to maintain the}} PVC/CPVC ration equal to 0. 8. the dry thickness of the painted samples was approximately 120 &# 956;m. The paint performance was monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) during immersion tests, of the atmospheric exposition and accelerated ensay of salt spray. The thermal stability of the paintings was also studied by thermal gravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. The impedance diagrams of all painted samples showed only one capacitive loop, with impedance values higher than 109 &# 937;cm 2. Capacitance values varied between 10 - 6 and 10 - 10 Fcm- 2. The results suggest that the combination of the molybdate and phosphate gives the best inhibitive properties. About the thermal analyses were observed that the molybdates and phosphomolybdates pigments showed the better performances thus in the thermal stability of epoxy resin, because theses pigments showed higher interaction between pigment-resin; just as in the relation the energy involved in the cure process of polymeric film, because these pigments contribued to reduce the heat involved in the cure process...|$|R
