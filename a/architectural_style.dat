Suetonius once commented that Rome was unworthy of its status as an imperial capital, yet Augustus and Agrippa set out to dismantle this sentiment by transforming the appearance of Rome upon the classical Greek model.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} derives {{its popular}} {{name from the}} ornate decorations depicting exotic animals and hunting scenes, which were sculpted by Italian architect Emilio Sala since Horodecki was an avid hunter. The name does not refer to the chimaera of mythology, but to an <b>architectural</b> <b>style</b> known as chimaera decoration in which animal figures are applied as decorative elements to a building. Horodecki unique <b>architectural</b> <b>style</b> earned him praise as the Antoni Gaudí of Kiev.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we show how {{software}} <b>architectural</b> <b>styles</b> {{can be used}} to guide objectoriented design. Design guidance is important as the initial phases of software design significantly impact software quality. We use two different <b>architectural</b> <b>styles</b> to guide the design process from a formal specification to a design. Software <b>architectural</b> <b>styles</b> assist by providing a different level of reuse than currently practised in software design. A style provides a framework for top-level structure and guides selection of components and interfaces. In this paper we show the impact of software <b>architectural</b> <b>styles</b> on software design...|$|R

40|$|The {{essence of}} <b>architectural</b> <b>styles</b> is {{component}} communication. In this paper, we relate <b>architectural</b> <b>styles</b> to adaptors in the GenVoca model of software construction. GenVoca components are refinements {{that have a}} wide range of implementations, from binaries to rule-sets of program transformation systems. We explain that <b>architectural</b> <b>styles</b> can (1) be understood as refinements (like other GenVoca components) and (2) that they are generalizations of the OO concept of adaptors. By implementing adaptors as program transformations, complex <b>architectural</b> <b>styles</b> can be realized in GenVoca that simply could not be expressed using less powerful implementation techniques (e. g., object adaptors).

5|$|Although Maya cities shared many common features, {{there was}} {{considerable}} variation in <b>architectural</b> <b>style.</b> Such styles were influenced by locally available construction materials, climate, topography, and local preferences.

5|$|Hoysala {{architecture}} is the building style developed {{under the rule}} of the Hoysala Empire between the 11th and 14th centuries, in the region known today as Karnataka, a state of India. Hoysala influence was at its peak in the 13th century, when it dominated the Southern Deccan Plateau region. Large and small temples built during this era remain as examples of the Hoysala <b>architectural</b> <b>style,</b> including the Chennakesava Temple at Belur, the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu, and the Kesava Temple at Somanathapura. Other examples of Hoysala craftsmanship are the temples at Belavadi, Amruthapura, Hosaholalu, Mosale, Arasikere, Basaralu, Kikkeri and Nuggehalli. Study of the Hoysala <b>architectural</b> <b>style</b> has revealed a negligible Indo-Aryan influence while the impact of Southern Indian style is more distinct.|$|E
40|$|<b>Architectural</b> <b>styles</b> {{are named}} {{collections}} of constraints on configurations of architectural elements, and {{are believed to}} bring economies of scale in applying software architecture techniques to software development. Most research on <b>architectural</b> <b>styles</b> focuses on analyzing and observing the properties of such styles from their descriptions. However, comparatively {{little is known about}} the systematic design and construction of software architectures using <b>architectural</b> <b>styles.</b> Existing classifications bring out differences between <b>architectural</b> <b>styles,</b> but none provides a clear understanding of the similarities among a large number of styles. The basis of our research is the observation that <b>architectural</b> <b>styles</b> share many underlying concepts. These shared concepts lead to “architectural primitives ” that can be systematically and constructively composed to obtain elements of <b>architectural</b> <b>styles.</b> We have identified eight forms and nine functions as architectural primitives that, in our understanding, reflect the syntactic and semantic characteristics of a large number of styles. While proving such a hypothesis is difficult in the general case, we demonstrate it within the domain of network-based styles. Partial formal models of style elements composed from these architectural primitives are also constructed and shown to be analyzable...|$|R

40|$|The {{software}} architecture of most systems is usually described informally and diagrammatically {{by means of}} boxes and lines. In order for these descriptions to be meaningful, the diagrams are understood by interpreting the boxes and lines in specic, conventionalized ways.

In this paper we consider these conventionalized interpretations as <b>architectural</b> <b>styles</b> and provide a formal framework for their uniform denition. In addition to providing a template for precisely dening new <b>architectural</b> <b>styles,</b> this framework allows for analysis within and between dierent <b>architectural</b> <b>styles...</b>|$|R
