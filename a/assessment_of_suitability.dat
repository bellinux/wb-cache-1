Greater objectivity can be brought to <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> <b>suitability</b> by comparing the performance of the aggrieved investor's portfolio to a benchmark portfolio using the Modigliani & Modigliani risk-adjusted performance measure. The applicable counterfactual benchmark could be either a ``market" portfolio or a suitable alternative portfolio.

Surface-mediated indium adatom migration is revealed by a direct comparison between quantum dot wetting layer, which acts as carrier channel, formed on a flat substrate and on a patterned substrate. For the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>suitability,</b> the carrier channel of the dot-in-well structure has also been studied by the present model, and the transition energies of the carrier channel (e. g., InGaAs quantum well) obtained from theoretical simulation agree fairly well with those obtained from the reflectance measurements...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>suitability</b> of the ALD method for application of a TiO 2 layer on surface of 316 LVM steel used for production of vessel stents. Selection of the appropriate process parameters for application of the layer affects its electrochemical properties, which largely determine resistance of the biomaterial to corrosion in the blood environment, thus affecting its hemocompatibility. To assess resistance of the AISI 316 LVM steel with modified surface to corrosion, voltammetric and impedance measurements were conducted. The proposed variant of surface processing allows safe deformation of the TiO 2 layer without its delamination...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>suitability</b> of mortar {{intended}} for reconstruction {{based on their}} characteristics, namely basic, hygric and mechanical parameters, chemical analysis and frost resistance, is presented in this paper.

40|$|Enhancing food {{security}} is a main goal of subsistence farmers in sub-Saharan Africa because these farmers are highly vulnerable to food insecurity. Participatory research can help stabilise and enhance {{food security}} through {{the development and implementation}} of upgrading strategies (UPS). Prior to dissemination, implementation, and upscaling to other areas, such practices require ex-ante <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> their <b>suitability</b> in target regions. These assessments need to be done by both the local stakeholders and scientists in a gender-specific way. This article reports the differences between 32 Tanzanian and German female and male scientists in their perception and <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>suitability</b> <b>of</b> 13 UPS. The authors found many gender specific differences depending on type <b>of</b> upgrading strategy, <b>suitability</b> criteria, and regional agro-climate.

40|$|Both {{demand and}} supply of {{financial}} advice are increasing {{because of the}} complexity of financial products and people’s difficulty in making economic decisions. Previous research has identified asymmetries between customers and financial advisors, which has given rise to the directive from the European Union, Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II). We show through a customer survey that goal asymmetry, risk asymmetry and information asymmetry are apparent in the relation between customer and financial advisor. Secondly, we find a positive correlation between customers’ financial illiteracy and risk asymmetry. Lastly, we show that MiFID II intends to reduce goal asymmetry though a commission ban, risk asymmetry through an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>suitability</b> and information asymmetry through an increased requirement of information...|$|E
40|$|The author {{examines}} the zero net house (ZNH) concept and makes preliminary <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> <b>suitability</b> for Alberta. The {{aim is to}} improve energy efficiency and reduce green house gas (GHG) emissions. The author compares a theoretical ZNH model, constructed from available historical data; construction data; and trends of consumption in Alberta to models of average class house (ACH) and industry-endorsed technical performance standard (R- 2000). Results indicate that ZNH is capable of achieving more GHG reduction levels and reduces energy requirements of occupants compared to ACH and R- 2000. Construction costs of ZNH in Alberta exceed that of ACH by 15 % but falls within literature's range. With energy escalation rate of 15 % per year, the ZNH savings could potentially allow occupants to pay off {{a significant part of}} the ZNH.

30|$|Some {{researchers}} have used nanofluid in nuclear systems for study. Wu and Zhao [13] in reviewing nanofluid heat transfer and {{critical heat flux}} enhancement especially in nuclear reactor have claimed that to turn nanofluid application from vision to reality, we need to first overcome some challenges, like a precise database of nanofluid thermo-physical properties and nanofluid stability in real working condition. Zarifi et al. performed a neutronic simulation of different nanofluids in VVER- 1000 reactor [13]. Their research aimed at optimization of type and characteristics. They also studied thermal–hydraulic modeling of nanofluid in this reactor, showing remarkable differences between nanofluid and pure water by increasing the concentration of nanoparticles [17]. Few researches have been done on using nanofluids in fusion-based systems. Barret et al. [11] experimentally investigated using nanofluid in fusion-relevant geometries with focus on studying nanofluid behavior in such environment. They showed an initial <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>suitability</b> of nanofluids as coolant in a fusion reactor.|$|E
