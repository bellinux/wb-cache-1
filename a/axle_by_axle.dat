40|$|Railway axles are safety–critical {{components}} and their structural integrity {{needs to be}} properly monitored against potentially catastrophic failures. This paper proposes a method for the continuous condition monitoring of railway <b>axles</b> <b>by</b> measuring the <b>axle</b> in-service bending vibration and diagnosing {{the presence of a}} fatigue crack based on the examination of harmonic components with periodicity corresponding to an integer sub-multiple of the axle revolution period (nxRev). To analyse the feasibility of the proposed method, full-scale measurements were performed on cracked and non-cracked railway axles undergoing fatigue tests and a mathematical Finite Element (FE) model of a cracked railway axle was defined and used to reproduce the laboratory experiments and also to analyse the case of a railway wheelset with cracked axle rolling on a railway track. The results of both experimental and numerical investigations show that the 1 xRev, 2 xRev and 3 xRev components of axle bending vibration can be used to detect the presence of cracks in axles, provided the crack area is in the range of 16...|$|R

5000|$|The Afrikaans {{name for}} this species [...] "spekvreter" [...] means [...] "fat-eater", and {{comes from the fact}} that it {{developed}} the habit of feeding on the lard used to grease wagon <b>axles</b> <b>by</b> the voortrekkers.|$|R
50|$|Power is {{transmitted}} from the engine to the rear <b>axle</b> <b>by</b> a chain. Both engine and axle sprockets are removable; their ratio must be adapted to the track configuration {{in order to get}} the most from the engine.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic rail {{contacts}} were actuated by the deflection of {{the rail}} caused <b>by</b> <b>axle</b> load running over the tracks. The first cylinders were filled with mercury; later hydraulic oil was used. They were then replaced by pneumatically operated switching elements.|$|R
50|$|On HULDA the firebox {{extended}} {{under the}} trailing <b>axle</b> <b>by</b> {{means of a}} sloping base {{in order to achieve}} the greatest possible grate area. Apart from MARSCHALL VORWÄRTS which had a conical chimney, all the engines had long cylindrical smokestacks.|$|R
50|$|The locomotives, {{which were}} built by Krauss {{were similar to}} the Class D VIII, but were smaller and lighter. Like the D VIII they had a {{trailing}} axle, that {{was connected to the}} final coupled <b>axle</b> <b>by</b> a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanical {{suspension}} of load capacity up to 8 tons per <b>axle</b> <b>by</b> torsion bars - for versions with one steered front axle (4x4 and 6x6) or by leaf springs - for versions with two steered axles (6x6, 8x8, 10x10 or 12x12).|$|R
5000|$|Reduce {{the amount}} of torque from the front <b>axle</b> <b>by</b> passing part of torque to the rear axle. This is {{achieved}} on all-wheel-drive (AWD) vehicles with full-time AWD, e.g. with mechanical gear-based transaxle differential, e.g. Audi AWD cars equipped with Torsen transaxle differential.|$|R

50|$|The Blood was an {{automobile}} manufactured in Kalamazoo, Michigan, by the Blood Brothers Auto & Machine Company from 1902-05. They produced a five-seater tonneau with a two-cylinder opposed engine, costing $1,800. The drive system had a four-speed transmission and transferred {{power to the}} rear <b>axle</b> <b>by</b> a shaft.|$|R
5000|$|The locomotive's {{design was}} {{started at the}} CBKPTK (Central Design Bureau of Railway Stock Industry) in Poznań. The design was finally made in 1961 by the ZNTK Poznań (Railway Stock Repair Works). It was powered by 75 hp diesel engine and had a {{mechanical}} transmission, driving two <b>axles</b> <b>by</b> cranks and connecting rods.|$|R
5000|$|Wheel and axle: Hoist, winch, {{rack and}} pinion, chain drive, belt drive, rigid chain and rigid belt {{actuators}} {{operate on the}} principle of the wheel and <b>axle.</b> <b>By</b> rotating a wheel/axle (e.g. drum, gear, pulley or shaft) a linear member (e.g. cable, rack, chain or belt) moves. By moving the linear member, the wheel/axle rotates.|$|R
50|$|Dropped axles {{were made}} of forged wrought iron. Although wood was widely used for axles, owing to its lightness, it could not easily be shaped with the sharp curves {{required}} to drop an axle. Shaping such an <b>axle</b> <b>by</b> sawing or cutting would place an area of cross-grain across the upright part and would rapidly break.|$|R
50|$|A {{center axle}} {{disconnect}} system or CAD {{is an alternative}} to locking hubs. CAD systems are typically used in front drive axles on four wheel drive vehicles. A CAD system works <b>by</b> having an <b>axle</b> shaft (typically the longer shaft) split into two pieces. One piece {{is connected to the}} carrier, the other connected to the wheel. This reduces drag on the <b>axle</b> <b>by</b> allowing only the spider and side gears to spin, while the differential carrier, pinion and drive shaft are at rest. The <b>axle</b> is engaged <b>by</b> connecting the two split axle shafts. The ends of the axles are typically splined and use a collar to connect the two shafts together by sliding over both shafts.|$|R
50|$|The DRG Class 99.17, {{formerly}} the Württemberg Ts 4 of the Royal Württemberg State Railways were German narrow gauge steam locomotives bought for working the 15.11 kilometre long route between {{the towns of}} Altensteig and Nagold. The three tank locomotives had an outer frame and a Klose drive. The first and third <b>axles</b> were steered <b>by</b> the third, radially-sliding <b>axle</b> <b>by</b> means {{of a system of}} levers. The second <b>axle</b> was driven <b>by</b> the inside cylinder and had no wheel flanges. Overall the system was very reliable, but nevertheless also very maintenance-intensive.|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} of disk brakes and quiet operation results that the trains are often poorly detected <b>by</b> <b>axle</b> counters which are commonly {{found on the}} lines where the DM'90 operates. Train-protection is provided by ATB-NG. For cross-border operations out of Heerlen, three sets were equipped with the German PZB train protection system along with boarding steps to accommodate the lower platform height.|$|R
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} Rolls-Royce BF 11500Ms230 torque multiplier {{has three}} steps. The three-step main gearbox {{is made by}} Foden. The power is divided between the front axle and two rear <b>axles</b> <b>by</b> a differential inside the ZF VG-800-4V1 transfer case. The mechanism includes disengaging possibility of the front-wheel-drive for transition drive; then also the hydraulic clutch can be passed by a mechanical connection.|$|R
50|$|A {{transfer}} {{case is a}} part of the drivetrain of four-wheel-drive, all-wheel-drive, and other multiple powered axle vehicles. The {{transfer case}} transfers power from the transmission to the front and rear <b>axles</b> <b>by</b> means of drive shafts. It also synchronizes the difference between the rotation of the front and rear wheels, and may contain one or more sets of low range gears for off-road use.|$|R
50|$|Each car was 62 ft {{long and}} 10 ft wide. The chairs {{could be turned}} around in order that the {{passengers}} were always looking in the travel direction. The cars had electric lighting powered <b>by</b> <b>axle</b> driven generators. 3rd class passengers did not have reserved seats. Punkah fans were provided only in 1st and 2nd class. The cars were fitted with vacuum brake and passenger alarm signal.|$|R

50|$|In general, the sidewinder and anglewinder {{are less}} common {{arrangements}} than the inline motor, {{in which the}} shaft is perpendicular to the driven axle, and drives it with bevel gears or a pinion and crown gear, and historically at least, less common than the pancake motor, in which the shaft is vertical and power is carried to the <b>axle</b> <b>by</b> a chain of gears through a pinion and crown arrangement.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company made}} an open runabout car, seating two people. The 1903 model had a [...] "piano-box body, and a rounded bonnet front {{on top of}} the dash", with a 5-horsepower single-cylinder engine {{water-cooled}} by natural gravity circulation. Power was transmitted to the rear <b>axle</b> <b>by</b> two chains. Weight of the car was 600 lb. This car was exhibited at the New York Automobile Show at Madison Square Garden in 1903.|$|R
50|$|Clutch and gearbox are bolted {{firmly to}} the engine block, gears are changed by a lever beside the driver's right hand {{operating}} in a gate. The clutch is not fully enclosed. Drive is carried to the rear <b>axle</b> <b>by</b> an enclosed propellor shaft. Spherical and universal joints are automatically oiled, there is a central bearing in the torque tube. Final drive is by spiral bevel and the axle is of the half-floating design.|$|R
50|$|In 1869, a small {{three-wheeled}} vehicle {{propelled by}} a horizontal twin cylinder engine which drove the rear <b>axle</b> <b>by</b> spur-gearing; only one rear wheel was driven, the other turning freely on the axle. A vertical fire-tube boiler was mounted {{at the rear}} with a polished copper casing over the fire box and chimney; the boiler was enclosed in a mahogany casing. The front wheel was used for steering and the weight was only 19 cwt.|$|R
5000|$|After the Bavarian GtL 4/4 (Bayerische GtL 4/4) {{class engines}} had {{proved to be}} very {{reliable}} and had all {{been taken over by}} the Reichsbahn, it was decided to build further examples of them. However, because they were very slow with a top speed of 40 km/h, the design was modified and the so-called GtL 4/5 was built with an additional trailing axle, that was linked to the final coupled <b>axle</b> <b>by</b> a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie.|$|R
50|$|A {{locomotive}} {{frame is}} the structure {{that forms the}} backbone of the railway locomotive, giving it strength and supporting the superstructure elements such as a cab, boiler or bodywork. The vast majority of locomotives have had a frame structure of some kind. The frame may in turn be supported <b>by</b> <b>axles</b> directly attached to it, or it may be mounted on bogies (UK) / trucks (US), or a combination of the two. The bogies in turn will have frames of their own.|$|R
5000|$|There were six, three-cylinder, [...] steam motors, {{which were}} attached, two per axle, to the driving <b>axles</b> <b>by</b> gearing. They had a maximum {{rotational}} speed of 1000 rpm, {{which would give}} the locomotive a theoretical maximum speed of 148 km/h. The small motors were less bulky, had a higher power-weight ratio and were more efficient. Their use eliminated {{the need for a}} crank axle, and enable the use of small diameter driving wheels of 1550 mm, and shortened the length of the locomotive ...|$|R
