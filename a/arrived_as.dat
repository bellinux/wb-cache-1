5|$|Reginald Pole, {{the son of}} Mary's {{executed}} governess {{and once}} considered a suitor, <b>arrived</b> <b>as</b> papal legate in November 1554. He was ordained a priest and appointed Archbishop of Canterbury immediately after Cranmer's death in March 1556.|$|E
5|$|A {{disastrous}} {{fire started}} {{on the seventh floor}} on the night of 16 March 1954 and spread downwards. The keepers had no time to raise the alarm and were driven out of the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel <b>arrived</b> <b>as</b> part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E
5|$|All three named commanders were slain {{during the}} battle, and Khalid was {{selected}} as the commander. He was able to maintain his heavily outnumbered army of 3,000 men against an army of 10,000 of the Byzantine Empire and Ghassanid Arabs in what would be known as the Battle of Mu'tah. Khalid assumed command of the Muslim army at the crucial moment, and defeated the Byzantine forces even when another 10,000 soldiers had <b>arrived</b> <b>as</b> reinforcements for the Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|At this time, C Flight <b>arrived.</b> <b>As</b> it dipped {{down through}} the {{overcast}} toward the dogfight, Gardiner and Taylor went astray. Maybery was attacked by a green Pfalz D.III. Hoidge's counterattack foiled the German. Bowman and Maybery remained to join the attack on Voss. Hoidge, having broken off his pursuit of the falling Pfalz, changed the drum magazine in his Lewis gun, and climbed to join battle.|$|E
5|$|Between 06:00 and 12:00 UTC on September10, the United States Weather Bureau issued storm signals, {{equivalent}} to a tropical storm warning in , from Cedar Key, Florida, to Charleston, South Carolina. These were later upgraded to hurricane warnings in South Florida. Due to inclement weather conditions in West Palm Beach, which had been newly incorporated as a town just days earlier, businesses suspended their normal operations and people boarded up buildings, even as the strongest winds <b>arrived.</b> <b>As</b> the cyclone moved into the Gulf of Mexico, reports from September 12 through September 14 helped ships prepare for the storm.|$|E
5|$|Carney <b>arrived</b> <b>as</b> U.S. Ambassador to Haiti on January 14, 1998. At {{the time}} of his appointment, Haiti was in {{political}} turmoil: former president, Jean-Bertrande Aristide, was locked in a battle to retake power in the election of 2000. Upon arrival in Haiti, Carney laid out U.S. concerns—lack of governance, lack of economic sustainability programs and an inability to prevent narco-trafficking through Haiti as the first port of call by the Cali drug cartels from Colombia.|$|E

5|$|Cheah, Kim and No {{would have}} been in the lower dan ranks, and would not yet have held the title of 'Master,' when they were invited to teach in Australia. A {{biography}} of No indicates that he had four years' training when he arrived. Rozinsky and Walsh would have held 1st dan ranking in the 1960s. Both Rhee (KTA) and Yun (ITF) {{would have been}} in the middle dan ranks and held the title of 'Master' when they <b>arrived,</b> <b>as</b> they were sent to Australia by their respective Korean governing bodies.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Grierson, {{commander}} of the 10th Cavalry, traversed the hot Chihuahuan Desert and then the narrow valleys of the Chinati Mountains, reaching Rattlesnake Springs {{on the morning of}} August 6, 1880. His cavalrymen and their mounts were worn down from the forced march of over 65miles in 21 hours. After resting and getting water, Grierson carefully placed his men in ambush positions. Carpenter, with his two cavalry troops, <b>arrived</b> <b>as</b> reinforcements and were posted in reserve a short distance south of the spring. The cavalrymen settled down to wait as Indian scouts brushed away any sign of their presence.|$|E
5|$|Foreign Minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned, shaving {{his head}} like a Buddhist monk in protest. Mẫu had decided to leave the country for a {{religious}} pilgrimage to India and the diplomatic and press corps assembled at the airport to see him off. He never <b>arrived,</b> <b>as</b> the Ngô family had him arrested. General Đính softened the punishment at the behest of a fellow officer, and put the former diplomat under house arrest instead of placing him in jail.|$|E

5|$|Houston {{promptly}} began {{organizing the}} troops at Gonzales into the First Regiment under Burleson who had <b>arrived</b> <b>as</b> {{part of the}} Mina volunteers. A second regiment would later be formed when the army grew large enough. As others began to arrive, individual volunteers not already in another company were put under Captain William Hestor Patton. Houston had 374 volunteers and their commanders in Gonzales on March 12.|$|E
5|$|In January 1900, Henn <b>arrived</b> <b>as</b> {{a missionary}} in Perth, Western Australia. After a short spell in Kalgoorlie, {{he moved to}} Geraldton as rector (parish priest). On 3 April 1902, in Geraldton, Henn married Jean Elliott. They {{eventually}} had four children together, one of whom, Guy Gavin Henn, {{became a member of}} parliament. Henn became a rector in Northam for three years (1902–1905), signifying the end of his missionary term. He returned to England and became organising secretary in the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in the dioceses of Canterbury and Rochester.|$|E
5|$|In the November 2, 1880 {{election}} for Pima County sheriff, Democrat Shibell ran against Republican Bob Paul, who {{was expected to}} win. Votes <b>arrived</b> <b>as</b> late as November 7, and Shibell was unexpectedly reelected. He immediately appointed Johnny Behan as the new deputy sheriff for eastern Pima County, a job that Wyatt wanted. A controversy ensued when Paul uncovered ballot-stuffing by Cowboys and he sued to overturn the election.|$|E

5|$|It {{was only}} by nightfall, when John the Armenian with his {{men and the}} 600 Huns rejoined his army, that Belisarius {{realized}} {{the extent of his}} victory. The cavalry spent the night at the battlefield. In the next morning, as the infantry (and Antonina) caught up, the whole army made for Carthage, where it <b>arrived</b> <b>as</b> night was falling. The Carthaginians had thrown open the gates and illuminated the city in celebration, but Belisarius, fearing a possible ambush in the darkness and wishing to keep his soldiers under tight control, refrained from entering the city, and encamped before it.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses bring {{captured}} prey {{back to the}} den {{where they}} can eat it safely. Sometimes the octopus catches more prey than it can eat, and the den is often surrounded by a midden of dead and uneaten food items. Other creatures, such as fish, crabs, molluscs and echinoderms, often share the den with the octopus, either because they have <b>arrived</b> <b>as</b> scavengers, or because they have survived capture.|$|E
5|$|Some Scots {{settled in}} the country's more {{temperate}} regions, where the climate and the forested landscape with glaciers and islands may have reminded them of their homeland (the Highlands and Northern Scotland) while English and Welsh made up the rest. The Irish immigrants, who were frequently confused with the British, <b>arrived</b> <b>as</b> merchants, tradesmen and sailors, settling along with the British in the main trading cities and ports.|$|E

5|$|The California {{spiny lobster}} {{is found in}} parts of the Gulf of California, and along the Pacific coast of the length of the Baja California peninsula, {{extending}} as far north as San Luis Obispo Bay, California. There are occasional records from Monterey Bay, but the water there is too cold for the California spiny lobster to breed, and it is thought that any adult found in Central California <b>arrived</b> <b>as</b> a larva during El Niño years.|$|E
5|$|When a large Ottoman force {{threatened}} the fortress, Kružić appealed to Ferdinand for help, but the Emperor's attention was diverted by an Ottoman attack in Slavonia. Kružić led {{the defense of}} Klis, and with his soldiers fought almost alone against the Ottomans, as they repeatedly hurled armies against the fortress. No troops from the Hungarian king <b>arrived,</b> <b>as</b> they were slaughtered by the Ottomans at the Battle of Mohács in 1526, and the Venetians baulked at sending any help. Only the pope was willing to provide some men and money.|$|E
5|$|While {{waiting for}} the Convention to {{formally}} begin, James Madison sketched out his initial draft, which {{became known as the}} Virginia Plan and reflected his views as a strong nationalist. By the time the rest of the Virginia delegation arrived, most of the Pennsylvania delegation had <b>arrived</b> <b>as</b> well. They agreed on Madison's plan, and formed what came to be the predominant coalition. By the time the Convention started, the only blueprints that had been assembled were Madison's Virginia Plan, and Charles Pinckney's plan. As Pinckney didn't have a coalition behind his plan, Madison's plan was the starting point for deliberations.|$|E
