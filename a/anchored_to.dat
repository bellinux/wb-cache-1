5|$|Following {{the death}} of French ally Hyder Ali in December 1782, British commanders at Madras decided to attempt the {{recapture}} of Cuddalore. The army marched south from Madras, circling around the city and then encamping south of it. The British fleet, eighteen ships-of-the-line including Gibraltar, under Admiral Sir Edward Hughes, <b>anchored</b> <b>to</b> the south to protect the army and its supply ships. By early June 1783 the Siege of Cuddalore was under way.|$|E
5|$|Like other theridiid spiders, the web is a disorganised, {{irregular}} {{tangle of}} fine textured silk. It is hammock-shaped and {{is made up}} of opaque yellowish-white silk. The web consists of a broad base with many supporting threads above and below, including a number of sticky guy lines <b>anchored</b> <b>to</b> debris in the sand. A cone-shaped retreat is built in {{the lower part of the}} web, although the katipo can normally be found near the main body of the web. The plants it builds its web in provide support and shelter for the nest.|$|E
5|$|Reptilian lungs {{typically}} receive air via {{expansion and}} contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and buccal pumping. Crocodilians also {{rely on the}} hepatic piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle <b>anchored</b> <b>to</b> the pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved into the lungs by Boyle's law. Turtles, which are unable to move their ribs, instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air {{in and out of}} the lungs.|$|E

5|$|Tarbosaurus lacked these bony struts, and the {{connection}} between the nasals and lacrimals was weak. Instead, a backwards projection of the maxilla was massively developed in Tarbosaurus and fit inside a sheath formed from the lacrimal. This projection was a thin, bony plate in North American tyrannosaurids. The large backwards projection suggests that force was transmitted more directly from the maxilla to the lacrimal in Tarbosaurus. The lacrimal was also more firmly <b>anchored</b> <b>to</b> the frontal and prefrontal bones in Tarbosaurus. The well-developed connections between the maxilla, lacrimal, frontal and prefrontal would have made its entire upper jaw more rigid.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{entomologist}} C.H. Curran's 1945 book, Insects of the Pacific World, noted {{women from}} India and Sri Lanka, who kept 1 1/2 inch long, iridescent greenish coppery beetles {{of the species}} Chrysochroa ocellata as pets. These living jewels were worn on festive occasions, probably with a small chain attached to one leg <b>anchored</b> <b>to</b> the clothing to prevent escape. Afterwards, the insects were bathed, fed, and housed in decorative cages. Living jewelled beetles have also been worn and kept as pets in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|At times, the coffers were full; in April 1764, {{near the}} end of the Paris sojourn and after two {{successful}} concerts, Leopold announced he would shortly be depositing 2,200 florins with his bankers. Two months later, after the initial London successes, Leopold banked a further 1,100 florins. However, in November of that year, after his illness and with uncertain earning prospects, he was worrying about the high costs of living in Londonhe informed Hagenauer that he had spent 1,870 florins in the four-month period since July. The following summer, after little concert activity, Leopold resorted to increasingly desperate measures to raise funds, including the children's daily circus performances at the Swan and Harp Inn at prices described by Jane Glover as humiliating. The insecurity of travelling life led Leopold to believe, later, that Wolfgang was not worldly-wise enough to attempt such journeys alone, and needed to be <b>anchored</b> <b>to</b> an assured salary.|$|E

5|$|Benedicte Wrensted (1859–1949) was {{a notable}} Danish female photographer, who {{emigrated to the}} USA in 1894. Wrensted learned her craft from her {{maternal}} aunt, Charlotte Borgen, {{and for a time}} in the 1880s operated a studio on Torvet 8, in Horsens, Denmark. Much of her photographic career is <b>anchored</b> <b>to</b> her studio in Pocatello, a small town in southeastern Idaho, where she took photographs of the local inhabitants and recorded the growth of the town. Perhaps her most famous work remains her documentary photographs of the Shoshone Great Basin Native Americans which are considered of great anthropological importance. Wrensted became a U.S. citizen in 1912, at age 53, and in the same year ended her career as a photographer. Many of her Native American images are preserved at the Smithsonian Institution and National Archives.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to larvae that have portable cases, {{members of the}} Annulipalpia have a completely different feeding strategy. They make fixed retreats in which they remain stationary, waiting for food to come to them. Members of the Psychomyiidae, Ecnomidae and Xiphocentronidae families construct simple tubes of sand and other particles held together by silk and <b>anchored</b> <b>to</b> the bottom, and feed on the accumulations of silt formed when suspended material is deposited. The tube can be lengthened when the growing larva needs to feed in new areas. More complex tubes, short and flattened, are built by Polycentropodidae larvae in hollows in rocks or other submerged objecte, sometimes with strands of silk suspended across the nearby surface. These larvae are carnivorous, resembling spiders in their feeding habits and rushing out of their retreat to attack any unwary small prey crawling across the surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{weather had}} begun to deteriorate, and {{it was decided that}} the schuit was not strong enough to bring the {{remaining}} Malagasy ashore. One end of a rope was <b>anchored</b> <b>to</b> the shore, and at low tide volunteers from the Dutch group on shore swam out to Meermin, bringing {{the other end of the}} rope with them and handing it up to the crew on the ship. The crew then helped the remaining fifty-three Malagasy climb down to the Dutch volunteers, who helped them to shore, some carrying children on their backs. The Dutch built a fire to warm the Malagasy after their immersion in the water, and fed them; three wagons took them to Cape Town on 12March. Of the 140 or so Malagasy who had been shipped, 112 reached the Cape Colony as slaves.|$|E

5|$|After the Fort Worth tornado dissipated, another {{thunderstorm}} {{developed over}} Johnson County, tracking northeastward into Tarrant County and eventually merging with the supercell that had produced the earlier F3tornado. The new development prompted the re-issuance of the tornado warning for Tarrant County at 6:40p.m. CST (00:40UTC). At 7:05p.m. CST (01:05UTC), the Arlington tornado touched down on South Cooper Road, causing initial {{damage to a}} restaurant; the tornado's touchdown coincided {{with the appearance of}} a tornado vortex signature on radar imagery. Well-built homes within a residential area along Embercrest Drive sustained widespread damage, with some houses experiencing up to F3-rated damage; such damage occurred after garage doors failed, allowing tornadic winds to unroof homes and push out exterior walls. As a consequence, homes that faced the tornadic winds sustained more damage than homes whose attached garages were sheltered from the strong winds. After crossing Matlock Road, the tornado did additional damage to one- and two-story homes in another subdivision, producing F3damage. Many homes suffered the collapse of brick masonry walls due to poor construction as they were not properly <b>anchored</b> <b>to</b> the homes' frames. The tornado then swept across northern portions of the Arlington Municipal Airport, dealing F2damage before briefly paralleling Interstate 20. At 7:12p.m. CST (01:12UTC), the tornado crossed the interstate, overturning at least one 18-wheeler. The twister continued to track northeast, causing F2damage to a subdivision northeast of Grand Prairie Municipal Airport in Dallas County before dissipating at 7:20p.m. CST (01:20UTC).|$|E
5|$|Between January and March 2010, the Australian monsoon trough {{extended}} unusually {{far east}} over the southern Pacific Ocean. With above-average sea surface temperatures, {{stemming from a}} moderate-strength El Niño, multiple low pressure systems were able to develop across the region. An unusual spree of tropical cyclogenesis in rapid succession ensued, including four hurricane-strength storms: Oli, Pat, Rene, and Tomas. On February6, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) began monitoring a tropical depression, dubbed 09F, well to the northeast of the Samoan Islands. Embedded within a well-developed trough, the system displayed curved convective banding features. Environmental conditions in the area, including low wind shear, high ocean heat content, and upper-level outflow, favored cyclogenesis. Additionally, an active Madden–Julian oscillation phase moving into the region was expected to bolster development. Steady improvement of the system's convective structure ensued and early on February7, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. The low trekked generally east-southeast {{in response to a}} near-equatorial ridge <b>anchored</b> <b>to</b> the north. The storm's appearance continued to improve and Dvorak classifications rose to T2.5, indicating gale-force winds were likely present. Accordingly, the JTWC began issuing advisories on the system at 18:00UTC and dubbed it Tropical Cyclone 14P. Forecasters noted, however, that the small size of the cyclone could lead to erroneously low Dvorak estimates. The FMS followed suit six hours later and assigned the name Pat to the cyclone, assessing it as a Category1 on the Australian cyclone scale.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} success of the fund drive, the {{pedestal}} was not completed until April 1886. Immediately thereafter, reassembly of the statue began. Eiffel's iron framework was <b>anchored</b> <b>to</b> steel I-beams within the concrete pedestal and assembled. Once this was done, the sections of skin were carefully attached. Due to the width of the pedestal, {{it was not possible to}} erect scaffolding, and workers dangled from ropes while installing the skin sections. Nevertheless, no one died during the construction. Bartholdi had planned to put floodlights on the torch's balcony to illuminate it; a week before the dedication, the Army Corps of Engineers vetoed the proposal, fearing that ships' pilots passing the statue would be blinded. Instead, Bartholdi cut portholes in the torch—which was covered with gold leaf—and placed the lights inside them. A power plant was installed on the island to light the torch and for other electrical needs. After the skin was completed, renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, co-designer of New York's Central Park and Brooklyn's Prospect Park, supervised a cleanup of Bedloe's Island in anticipation of the dedication.|$|E

5|$|Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey {{features}} a RoboCoaster G2 ride system provided by Dynamic Structures, KUKA and RoboCoaster. The first generation RoboCoaster system featured KUKA robotic arm technology <b>anchored</b> <b>to</b> a stationary platform, while the second-generation G2 system mounted the arms on a busbar track. The system was first publicly disclosed at the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Trade Show in 2003. At {{around the same}} time, rumors began circulating {{about the possibility of}} Islands of Adventure adding a Van Helsing-themed ride using this technology. These plans were later scrapped with Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ultimately using the same technology and opening on the same plot of land proposed for the Van Helsing ride. The ride's seats are mounted on robotic arms which are in turn mounted on a track. This allows the arms to travel through the attraction while performing their movements in synchronization with the ride's show elements (animated props, projection surfaces, etc.). This concept first appeared in the 2004 International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Trade Show. The disadvantage of this intricate machinery is that if the ride breaks down, some guests are stranded in uncomfortable positions, such as being tilted backwards in dark enclosed spaces.|$|E
