5|$|Although it can {{be found}} in {{elevations}} up to about , it is far more commonly found in humid lowland areas, and most often observed in subtropical, marshy regions of its range. It is also frequently found in shrublands, woodlands, agricultural fields, and mangroves, often adjacent to water, such as rivers, streams, rice paddies, and ditches. It may also sometimes be found in villages and suburban areas. It is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> in other habitats also.|$|E

50|$|The Arkham Knight dons a militaristic {{version of}} the Batsuit aimed to mock Batman's appearance. Every {{component}} of his suit has a significant purpose. The suit is also very durable, being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> completely <b>survive</b> the explosion that brought the abandoned Arkham Asylum to the ground.|$|R
50|$|Adult foliar {{nematodes}} are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> overwinter by <b>surviving</b> in {{dried plant}} tissue in a dormant state. The nematodes can survive in this dead leaf material for several months. Foliar nematodes do not survive {{for very long}} in bare soil alone.|$|R
5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the hardiest insects. Some species are capable of {{remaining}} active for a month without food and are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> on limited resources, such as the glue {{from the back of}} postage stamps. Some can go without air for 45 minutes. Japanese cockroach (Periplaneta japonica) nymphs, which hibernate in cold winters, survived twelve hours at −5°C to −8°C in laboratory experiments.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies {{including}} libellulids and aeshnids {{are found}} in desert pools, for example in the Mojave Desert, where they are active in shade temperatures between 18 and 45°C (64.4 to 113°F); these insects were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> body temperatures above the thermal death point of insects {{of the same species}} found in cooler places.|$|E
5|$|Snow affects such human {{activities}} as transportation: creating {{the need for}} keeping roadways, wings, and windows clear; agriculture: providing water to crops and safeguarding livestock; such sports as skiing, snowboarding, snowmachine travel; and warfare: impairing target acquisition, degrading the performance of combatants and materiel, and impeding mobility. Snow affects ecosystems, as well, by providing an insulating layer during winter under which plants and animals are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> the cold.|$|E
50|$|With {{the help}} of Siberian Huskies, entire tribes of people were <b>able</b> not only <b>to</b> <b>survive,</b> but <b>to</b> push forth into terra incognita. Admiral Robert Peary of the United States Navy was aided by this breed during his expeditions {{in search of the}} North Pole.|$|R

5|$|Their {{reproduction}} is both rapid and profuse. The {{combination of a}} high mutation rate and a horizontal gene transfer ability makes them highly adaptable, and <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> in new environments, including outer space.

5|$|As birds began nesting on the island, soil {{conditions}} improved, and more vascular plant species were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b> In 1998, {{the first bush}} {{was found on the}} island—a tea-leaved willow (Salix phylicifolia), which can grow to heights of up to 4metres (13ft). By 2008, 69species of plant had been found on Surtsey, of which about 30 had become established. This compares to the approximately 490 species found on mainland Iceland. More species continue to arrive, at a typical rate of roughly 2–5new species per year.|$|E
5|$|Auxois {{horses are}} usually bay or bay roan in color, {{although}} {{they can also}} be chestnut or red roan, similar to the Ardennais. gray and seal brown (the latter called black pangaré by the breed registry, although these horses are genetically brown, not black with pangaré markings) are also accepted for registration; all other colors are excluded. The Auxois is known for its power and docility, having a calm and gentle temperament. Like the Ardennais, it is an easy keeper, <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> outdoors in all seasons, even in the harsh climatic conditions sometimes seen in Morvan and Nievre.|$|E

5000|$|Cultural {{practice}} {{is also a}} subject of discussion in questions of cultural survival. [...] If an ethnic group retains its formal ethnic identity but loses its core cultural practices or the knowledge, resources, or ability to continue them, questions arise {{as to whether the}} culture is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> actually <b>survive</b> at all. International bodies such as the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues continually work on these issues, which are increasingly at the forefront of globalization questions.|$|R

5|$|Breathing air is {{primarily}} {{of use to}} fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and cichlids, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that {{is little more than}} wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of aestivation (summertime hibernation) until water returns.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches are {{generally}} omnivorous; the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana), for example, feeds {{on a great}} variety of foodstuffs including bread, fruit, leather, starch in book bindings, paper, glue, skin flakes, hair, dead insects and soiled clothing. Many species of cockroach harbor symbiotic protozoans and bacteria in their gut which are able to digest cellulose. In many species, these symbionts may be essential if the insect is to utilize cellulose; however, some species secrete cellulase in their saliva, and the wood-eating cockroach, Panesthia cribrata, is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> indefinitely on a diet of crystallized cellulose while being free of micro-organisms.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{and other}} facultative anaerobes {{constitute}} about 0.1% of gut flora, and fecal–oral transmission {{is the major}} route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease. Cells are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> outside the body for {{a limited amount of}} time, which makes them potential indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination. A growing body of research, though, has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can survive for extended periods outside a host.|$|E
40|$|A {{successful}} pathogen is {{one that}} is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> effectively <b>survive</b> and evade detection by the host innate immune defense. Fungal pathogens have adopted strategies which evade host defense and eventually cause disease in at-risk patients. Shielding of stimulatory surface recognition molecules, shedding of decoy components, induction of anti-inflammatory signals, complement evasion and resilient survival capacity are successful evasion mechanisms employed by fungal pathogens. Understanding these complex pathways of immune evasion can potentially contribute to development of novel therapeutic strategies against fungal infections...|$|R
40|$|Viable {{systems may}} be seen as third order cybernetic systems of {{coherent}} social organisations that are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> dynamically <b>survive.</b> Part of their survival process involves anticipation that is embedded in their logical models. The development of viable systems often occurs despite their inability to develop common patterns of knowledge for their world view holders. This has means that new anticipatory processes must be activated, when their viability may be endangered.

50|$|According to {{the theory}} of living human systems, groups that are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> take in and use {{differences}} are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> not only <b>survive</b> but also develop and transform. This kind of development enables groups to use their differences as resources to find solutions to problems that are more comprehensive and responsive to the complexity of the problem. They are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> move with less difficulty toward their goals.|$|R
5|$|Indeed, {{scholars}} such as Christopher Snyder {{believe that}} during the 5th and 6th centuries– approximately from 410AD when Roman legions withdrew, to 597AD when St. Augustine of Canterbury arrived– southern Britain preserved a sub-Roman society that was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> the attacks from the Anglo-Saxons and even use a vernacular Latin (called British Latin) for an active culture. There is even the possibility that this vernacular Latin lasted to the late 7th century {{in the area of}} Chester, where amphorae and archaeological remnants of a local Romano-British culture at Deva Victrix have been found.|$|E
5|$|Solitary in nature, the Atlantic torpedo {{is often}} seen resting on or half-buried in the {{substrate}} during the day, becoming more active at night. Large and well-defended from attack, it seldom falls prey to other animals. Known parasites of the Atlantic torpedo include the tapeworms Calyptrobothrium occidentale and C. minus, Grillotia microthrix, Monorygma sp., and Phyllobothrium gracile, the monogeneans Amphibdella flabolineata and Amphibdelloides maccallumi, and the copepod Eudactylina rachelae. Some accounts suggest that this ray may be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> out of water {{for up to a}} day.|$|E
5|$|The A-10 is {{exceptionally}} tough, being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> direct {{hits from}} armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 23mm. It has double-redundant hydraulic flight systems, and a mechanical {{system as a}} back up if hydraulics are lost. Flight without hydraulic power uses the manual reversion control system; pitch and yaw control engages automatically, roll control is pilot-selected. In manual reversion mode, the A-10 is sufficiently controllable under favorable conditions to return to base, though control forces are greater than normal. The aircraft is designed to fly with one engine, one half of tail, one elevator, and half of a wing missing.|$|E
50|$|Angomonas deanei is a flagellated trypanosomatid. It is an obligate {{parasite}} in the gastrointestinal tract of insects, {{and is in}} turn a host to symbiotic bacteria. In fact the bacterial endosymbiont maintains a permanent mutualistic relationship with the protozoan such {{that it is no}} longer <b>able</b> <b>to</b> reproduce and <b>survive</b> on its own.|$|R
40|$|A {{successful}} pathogen is {{one that}} is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> effectively <b>survive</b> and evade detection by the host immune defense. Oral candidiasis has adopted strategies, which evade host defense and eventually cause disease in at-risk patients. Host defense against infections with Candida spp. depends on rapid activation of an acute inflammatory response by innate immunity, followed by an incremental stimulation of specific immune responses mediated by T-cells (cellular immunity) or B-cells (humoral immunity). Understanding these complex pathways of immune evasion can potentially {{contribute to the development of}} novel therapeutic strategies against oral candidiasis...|$|R
50|$|Christophe is {{tortured}} to death. Bird, Gosling and {{a handful}} of his village are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> escape and <b>survive</b> on an island in the 'Sweet Water Sea' where Bird buries Snow Falls.

5|$|The Marsh Tacky {{is known}} by owners for its stamina {{and ability to}} work in water and swamps without panicking. They tend to be sure-footed, sturdy, smart, and <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> in {{challenging}} coastal environments, {{as well as being}} easy keepers. Their small size and gentle nature made them the historically preferred mount for children and women, but they were also used as working animals due to their abilities in the field. Today, they are used in endurance riding, as well as continuing their traditional work assisting humans with hunting wild game and herding cattle.|$|E
5|$|The three coves to {{the east}} of Helvellyn are all {{important}} sites for remnant populations of arctic-alpine plants. Species such as downy willow (Salix lapponum), mountain avens (Dryas octopetala), alpine mouse-ear (Cerastium alpinum), alpine meadowgrass (Poa alpina) and others have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> in these coves since the last glaciation through a combination of rocks rich in basic minerals, a harsh micro-climate, and inaccessibility to grazing sheep on cliff ledges. However, these populations are small and are not reproducing well. Natural England has introduced a recovery plan for them.|$|E
5|$|The tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis) in the Amazon River {{is another}} species descended from oceanic dolphins; however, {{it does not}} {{perfectly}} fit the label of 'facultative' either, as it occurs only in fresh water. The tucuxi was until recently considered conspecific with the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), which inhabits marine waters. It may also be true for the Irrawaddy dolphin and the finless porpoise that, although the species {{may be found in}} both freshwater and marine environments, individual animals found in rivers may not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> in the ocean, and vice versa. The tucuxi is currently classified as an oceanic dolphin (Delphinidae).|$|E
50|$|After John Henry's {{marriage}} was conclusively divorced according to canon law in 1349, he married Margaret of Opava, daughter of Duke Nicholas II and Charles IV {{gave him the}} Bohemian Margraviate of Moravia as appanage. In turn, John henry had to renaounce all rights to the Bohemian throne. His second marriage produced several sons, none of whom however was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> leave <b>surviving</b> children, so John Henry's line ended in 1411. The eldest was Margrave Jobst of Moravia, the Elector of Brandenburg from 1388 on, who in 1410 became elected King of the Romans, but remained actually a rival king.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, {{since the}} Puppeteers are careful {{to an extreme}} degree to avoid any risk at all, they don't trust even these hulls completely. They have {{therefore}} installed {{in at least two}} (and possibly all) of their ships a Slaver Stasis field, which stops time inside the hull instantly should anything bad happen, and keeps it stopped until the bad thing goes away. In the absence of time, nothing can possibly affect the contents of the Stasis field until it turns itself off. Indeed, Louis Wu speculates that a ship with its Stasis field on would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> handily <b>survive</b> a second big bang (though several stories cast doubt on this).|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the flour beetle, Tribolium confusum, was studied through all stages of its life cycle. The results show that for each environmental factor there is a limited range of values within which the organisms are <b>able</b> best <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> and that this optimum range of survival becomes smaller when additional stresses are imposed upon the organism. This has been shown for external temperature, oxygen content of the atmosphere, gravity compensation, and radiation. On Biosatellite II it was shown that Tribolium pupae irradiated in spaceflight exhibited more wing abnormalities than ground controls. Later it was shown that gravity compensation, when combined with irradiation, can induce a similar effect at ground level...|$|R
