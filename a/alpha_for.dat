25|$|Stochastic {{processes}} {{may be used}} {{in music}} to compose a fixed piece or may be produced in performance. Stochastic music was pioneered by Iannis Xenakis, who coined the term stochastic music. Specific examples of mathematics, statistics, and physics applied to music composition are the use of the statistical mechanics of gases in Pithoprakta, statistical distribution of points on a plane in Diamorphoses, minimal constraints in Achorripsis, the normal distribution in ST/10 and Atrées, Markov chains in Analogiques, game theory in Duel and Stratégie, group theory in Nomos <b>Alpha</b> (<b>for</b> Siegfried Palm), set theory in Herma and Eonta, and Brownian motion in N'Shima. Xenakis frequently used computers to produce his scores, such as the ST series including Morsima-Amorsima and Atrées, and founded CEMAMu. Earlier, John Cage and others had composed aleatoric or indeterminate music, which is created by chance processes but does not have the strict mathematical basis (Cage's Music of Changes, for example, uses a system of charts based on the I-Ching). Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Issacson used generative grammars and Markov chains in their 1957 Illiac Suite. See: Generative music.|$|E

500|$|The SIII {{is powered}} by Android, a Linux-based, open source mobile {{operating}} system developed by Google and introduced commercially in 2008. Among other features, the software allows users to maintain customized home screens which can contain shortcuts to applications and widgets for displaying information. Four shortcuts to frequently used applications can be stored on a dock {{at the bottom of}} the screen; the button in the center of the dock opens the application drawer, which displays a menu containing all of the apps installed on the device. A tray accessed by dragging from the top of the screen allows users to view notifications received from other apps, and contains toggle switches for commonly used functions. Pre-loaded apps also provide access to Google's various services. The SIII uses Samsung's proprietary TouchWiz graphical user interface (GUI). The [...] "Nature" [...] version used by the SIII has a more [...] "organic" [...] feel than previous versions, and contains more interactive elements such as a water ripple effect on the lock screen. To complement the TouchWiz interface, and as a response to Apple's Siri, the phone introduces S Voice, Samsung's intelligent personal assistant. S Voice can recognize eight languages including English, Korean, Italian and French. Based on Vlingo, S Voice enables the user to verbally control 20 functions such as playing a song, setting the alarm, or activating driving mode; it relies on Wolfram <b>Alpha</b> <b>for</b> online searches.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{the fall}} of 1907, Hedgeman was {{instrumental}} in founding Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated, America's first Greek-letter organization established by Black college women. [...] Hedgeman {{was inspired by the}} accounts of Tremaine Robinson, a faculty member at Howard who shared her sorority experiences at Brown University. Hedgeman was also aided in her efforts by her friend George Lyle, whom she had dated since high school. [...] He was a charter member the Beta chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity at Howard in 1907. To establish a sorority, Hedgeman began recruiting interested classmates during the summer of 1907. Together, the nine classmates founded Alpha Kappa Alpha on January 15, 1908. Hedgeman served as vice-president of the sorority, since she was a junior, and designed the insignia for the sorority. Starting in the 1920s, as national treasurer of Alpha Kappa <b>Alpha</b> <b>for</b> more than 20 years, Lyle (by then married) continued to guide the sorority and its growth.|$|E

Harper explained that [...] "So far she's been very much in control and is very <b>alpha</b> <b>for</b> a junior doctor, but we're going to learn that there's more complexity and vulnerability behind the polished exterior." [...] Michie labeled the relationship between Zosia and Guy [...] "strange and dyfunctional". Following the death of Zosia's mother, Guy began drinking and had affairs. This distanced the pair and Guy chose to come to Holby City not only to help his career. Michie said [...] "he wants to retrieve the love of his daughter". This task is made extremely difficult because [...] "she blames him for everything thats wrong in her life." [...] When Guy tries to make amends with Zosia she rejects him and makes it clear she only wants a professional relationship with him. But her animosity towards Guy begins to affect her career progression.|$|E
