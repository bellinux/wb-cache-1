5|$|The Bank of the United States was {{established}} by Alexander Hamilton to provide stable banking services on a national scale, <b>and</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> open a branch in Boston. Hamilton recruited heavily in the Bank of Massachusetts, and Gore {{decided to make the}} move. He sold his shares in the Massachusetts bank, and became a director of the Boston branch of the U.S. Bank. He also purchased 200 shares in the new bank, a relatively large investment. Gore was influential in making hiring decisions for the branch, <b>and</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> merge state-chartered banks into the organization, arguing that only a nationally chartered bank could provide consistent and stable service. Gore resigned from the board in 1794, citing the demands of his law practice.|$|E

5|$|A former member, Lewis had {{a privileged}} {{upbringing}} <b>and</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> help {{the less fortunate}} and fight oppression and corruption as a crime-fighter. To this end Lewis created a costume with special wings that helped him glide. His mental stability ultimately deteriorated after he was called before HUAC, leading to him being forcibly brought to a mental asylum.|$|E
5|$|A {{little before}} 16:00, Ney noted an {{apparent}} exodus from Wellington's centre. He mistook {{the movement of}} casualties to the rear for {{the beginnings of a}} retreat, <b>and</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> exploit it. Following the defeat of d'Erlon's Corps, Ney had few infantry reserves left, as most of the infantry had been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right. Ney therefore tried to break Wellington's centre with cavalry alone.|$|E
5|$|After his {{graduation}} from Whittier in 1934, Nixon received {{a full scholarship}} to attend Duke University School of Law. The school was new <b>and</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> attract top students by offering scholarships. It paid high salaries to its professors, {{many of whom had}} national or international reputations. The number of scholarships was greatly reduced for second- and third-year students, forcing recipients into intense competition. Nixon not only kept his scholarship but was elected president of the Duke Bar Association, inducted into the Order of the Coif, and graduated third in his class in June 1937.|$|E

5|$|After relinquishing {{command of}} the 8th TFW on September 23, 1967, Olds {{reported}} for duty to the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in December 1967. He served as Commandant of Cadets for three years <b>and</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> restore morale {{in the wake of}} a major cheating scandal. Olds was promoted to brigadier general on June 1, 1968, with seniority dating from May 28.|$|E
5|$|As Lord President of the Council, Dudley {{headed a}} {{distinctly}} conciliar government <b>and</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> introduce the adolescent King into business. Taking over an almost bankrupt administration, he ended the costly wars with France and Scotland and tackled finances {{in ways that}} led to some economic recovery. To prevent further uprisings he introduced countrywide policing on a local basis, appointing Lords Lieutenants who were {{in close contact with}} the central authority. Dudley's religious policy was—in accordance with Edward's proclivities—decidedly Protestant, further enforcing the English Reformation and promoting radical reformers to high Church positions.|$|E
5|$|As the war ended, the Holt {{company was}} left with huge surplus {{inventories}} of heavy-duty tractors ill-suited for the agricultural market, which had been dominated during the war by the Holt Company's primary competitor, C.L.Best. The company decided to focus instead on heavy construction equipment <b>and</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> capitalize on {{the passage of the}} Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. Laden with debt and needing more capital to switch its product line, the company struggled to move forward.|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{territorial}} gains {{following the}} Paris Peace Conference, the Greeks still hoped {{to achieve the}} Megali Idea and annex Constantinople and larger areas of Ottoman Asia Minor; they invaded Anatolia beyond Smyrna <b>and</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> take Ankara, {{with the aim of}} destroying the Turkish resistance led by Mustafa Kemal (later known as Atatürk). Thus began the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). Although Alexander's reign saw success after success for the Greek armies, it was eventually Atatürk's revolutionary forces that obtained victory in 1922.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{a series}} of Japanese air attacks on the Mariana Islands took place between November 1944 and January 1945. These raids {{targeted}} United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bases <b>and</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> disrupt the bombing of Japan by B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers operating from the islands. The Japanese lost 37 aircraft during this operation, but destroyed 11 B-29s and damaged a further 43. Preparations were also made for commando raids on the bases in early and mid-1945 but these did not go ahead.|$|E
5|$|German and Italian spies kept a {{constant}} watch on Gibraltar <b>and</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> carry out sabotage operations, sometimes successfully. The Italians repeatedly carried out raids on Gibraltar's harbour using human torpedoes and divers operating from the Spanish shore, damaging {{a number of}} merchant ships and sinking one. Three Spaniards being run as spies and saboteurs by the German Abwehr were caught in Gibraltar in 1942–43 and hanged. The threat to Gibraltar was greatly reduced {{after the collapse of}} Italy in September 1943.|$|E

5|$|Gordon Brown was an {{important}} figure in Blair's Labour government and {{played a key role}} in developing the party's philosophy. Brown served as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1992 to 1997 and was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer following Labour's election victory in 1997. He attempted to control public spending <b>and</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> increase the funding for education and healthcare. His economic strategy was market-based, attempting to reform the welfare state through a tax credit scheme for poorer working families, and he assigned the Bank of England to set interest rates.|$|E
5|$|Having {{departed}} Cadix, the Polish personnel evaded the occupying Italian security {{police and}} German Gestapo <b>and</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> escape France via Spain.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the initial impact {{of rock and}} roll on {{mainstream}} American culture waned as major record companies took a controlling influence <b>and</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> market more conventionally acceptable recordings. Electric musical instruments (particularly guitars) and amplification were becoming more affordable, allowing young musicians to form small groups to perform in front of local audiences of their peers; and in some areas there was a breakdown, especially among radio audiences, of traditional black and white markets, with more white teenagers listening to and purchasing R records.|$|E

McCain introduced various policy proposals, <b>and</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> improve his fundraising. Cindy McCain, who accounts {{for most of the}} couple's wealth with an estimated net worth of $100million, made part of her tax returns public in May. After facing criticism about lobbyists on staff, the McCain campaign issued new rules in May 2008 to avoid conflicts of interest, causing five top aides to leave.|$|E
5|$|Pierce charged Treasury Secretary James Guthrie with {{reforming}} the Treasury, which was inefficiently managed and had many unsettled accounts. Guthrie increased oversight of Treasury employees and tariff collectors, {{many of whom}} were withholding money from the government. Despite laws requiring funds to be held in the Treasury, large deposits remained in private banks under the Whig administrations. Guthrie reclaimed these funds <b>and</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> prosecute corrupt officials, with mixed success.|$|E
5|$|Sociologist Joel Best {{wrote in}} 1993 {{that during the}} late 19th century, adults {{developed}} an increased concern {{for the welfare of}} children. Best noted that societies experienced decreasing birth rates after industrialization, with parents focusing their attention on fewer children. According to him, at that time adults began to view childhood as a sacred period of development and children as invaluable, adorable, guiltless beings. During the 1970s and 1980s, Best wrote, adults, saw children as potential victims <b>and</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> eliminate perceived threats.|$|E
