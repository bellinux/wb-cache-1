50|$|<b>A</b> classic <b>long</b> <b>drink</b> is <b>a</b> Tom Collins. A simple {{style of}} <b>long</b> <b>drink</b> is the highball, a {{cocktail}} composed of one liquor and one mixer, (excluding garnish or ice). A {{classic example of}} the highball is the gin and tonic.|$|R
60|$|In {{several minutes}} he was back. He mixed the due {{quantity}} of river slush with the alcohol, took <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> solitary <b>drink,</b> and stared with bitter moodiness into the fire.|$|R
60|$|In {{five minutes}} the two {{soldiers}} relieved those on guard, and they, also, took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drink</b> at the canteen, {{to which the}} sergeant also again applied his lips.|$|E
60|$|Whereupon, leaving Jerry on deck to stalk the wild-dog, Captain Van Horn went below {{into the}} tiny stateroom and took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drink</b> from the very bottle from which Borckman was stealing.|$|E
60|$|He {{climbed down}} and {{got what he}} was in search of--a large flask full of brandy-and-water, which he carried {{in one of the}} holsters. He took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drink,</b> and felt better at once.|$|E
60|$|He clattered {{along the}} gorge {{knocking}} the stones and started down. I watched him letting himself over {{the end of}} the huge slabs until he passed out of my sight. <b>A</b> good, <b>long</b> <b>drink</b> revived me and I began the ascent.|$|R
60|$|The weary riders {{unpacked}} the outfit, took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> deep <b>drink</b> of {{the cold}} water, and unrolling their tarps went supperless to bed. Pan's eyes closed as if with glue and his thoughts wavered, faded.|$|R
6000|$|Der jungere Uhlanen [...] Sit round mit {{open mouth}} [...] While Breitmann tell dem stdories [...] Of fightin' in the South; [...] Und gif dem moral lessons, [...] How before der battle pops, [...] Take a little prayer to Himmel [...] Und <b>a</b> goot <b>long</b> <b>drink</b> of Schnapps.|$|R
60|$|In a {{short time}} he {{returned}} with a basin of ice and a jugful of iced lime-juice. Nat took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drink,</b> and then turned so that the ice {{could be applied to}} the wound.|$|E
60|$|The man {{pocketed}} the note and set before them the beer {{which he was}} carrying. Kendricks, whose knuckles were bleeding, laid his hand under the table. Julien took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drink</b> of the beer and began to recover his breath.|$|E
6000|$|Little {{was said}} during the meal; {{fortunately}} the table was bounteously spread, for the newcomer's appetite was prodigious; but at last he was satisfied, and after <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drink</b> at the horn beside him, which Elspeth had kept filled with ale, he said: ...|$|E
60|$|Kneeling down, {{he enjoyed}} <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> {{refreshing}} <b>drink</b> {{of the clear}} water, but as he started to regain his feet a coil of rope was suddenly thrown about him, pinning his arms to his sides and rendering him absolutely helpless.|$|R

6000|$|... “What a pity {{we did not}} {{search for}} this before,” Stephen said, as {{throwing}} themselves down each scooped {{a hole in the}} sand, and took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drink</b> of the fresh water. “We could have saved our wine for some special occasion.” ...|$|E
60|$|Accordingly {{the dried}} meat and flour were {{transferred}} to the canoe, the kettles were filled up with fresh water, and, after taking <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drink</b> and letting Jack lap {{as much as he}} could take, they took their seats in the canoe again, threw off the tow-rope and started due west.|$|E
60|$|Feeling, therefore, {{comparatively}} safe, {{he paused}} in his mad flight, {{and went down}} {{on hands and knees}} to take <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drink</b> at a bubbling spring. Rising, refreshed, with a deep sigh, he slowly mounted {{to the top of a}} knoll which was bathed at the time in the first beams of the rising sun.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Excellent notion. It is <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{time between}} <b>drinks.</b> There are {{the makings of}} a very fine prig in you, Dick,' said the Nilghai.|$|R

60|$|Private Bliss {{took his}} head away, and holding it very erect, took {{in his belt}} a little and walked slowly {{up and down the}} deck. Then he went to the water-cask and took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drink,</b> and an hour later a generous message was {{received}} from the skipper that he might have as many biscuits as he liked.|$|E
6000|$|... "They must be rolling a {{good deal}} more in the 'Nancy' than we are here, Peter. Now, the first thing is to have a drink. What a blessing it is we have water." [...] With their knives they soon got the bung out of the water-keg, and each took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drink,</b> and then {{carefully}} closed it up again.|$|E
60|$|He spoke a {{few words}} in a low tone to his two men and they passed into the galley, where Hans and Sam showed them the food that was on board.

6000|$|... "It's a {{compliment}} when I tell you I wasn't a bit surprised," [...] he said. [...] "I'd expected {{something of the}} kind from you. The Allinson strain showed up well to-day. You got hold of them and swept them off their feet. Robert, too, proved himself a brick; but he's waiting in the passage and we must try to shunt him. He'll lecture me on my new duties and I want <b>a</b> big, <b>long</b> <b>drink.</b> In fact, half a dozen would be better." ...|$|R
5000|$|It has a dark-brown colour with {{a reddish}} tint, and tastes subtly of spice and citrus fruit. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> summer <b>long</b> <b>drink,</b> {{it is also}} {{commonly}} served with [...] "English-style" [...] (clear and carbonated) lemonade, as well as various chopped garnishes, particularly apples, cucumber, oranges, lemons, strawberry, and mint or borage, though nowadays most substitute mint. Ginger ale is a common substitute for lemonade. Pimm's can also be mixed with Champagne (or a sparkling white wine), called a [...] "Pimm's Royal Cup". Pimm's Winter Cup is generally mixed with warm apple juice.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "caffè crema" [...] also {{refers to}} <b>a</b> <b>long</b> espresso <b>drink,</b> popular since the 1980s in Switzerland and {{northern}} Italy. It is generally {{served as the}} standard [...] "café traditionnel" [...] in Belgium. It is produced by running 180-240 ml of water when brewing an espresso, primarily by using a coarser grind. It {{is similar to a}} caffè Americano or <b>a</b> <b>long</b> black, except that these latter are diluted espresso, and consist of making ("pulling") a normal (short) espresso shot and combining it with unbrewed hot water. By contrast, a caffè crema extracts differently, and thus has a different flavor profile.|$|R
60|$|When {{dinner was}} done, and when what {{remained}} of the platters and {{what remained of}} the congealed gravy had been put back into {{what remained of the}} pie, which served as an economical investment for all miscellaneous savings, Riderhood filled the mug with beer and took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drink.</b> And now he did look at Bradley, and with an evil eye.|$|E
60|$|The Rovers {{and their}} chums had retreated to a distance, {{and this was}} wise, for, had Glutts and Carncross {{been able to get}} hold of them, there would {{certainly}} have been a fight. But as it was, the bully and his cronies passed down a back corridor to the nearest bathroom, where they proceeded to wash out their mouths and get <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drink.</b>|$|E
60|$|They {{stopped at}} the Café de Paris and left the car under the trees. Both men took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drink</b> and Richard filled his pocket with cigarettes. Then they re-entered the car, lit up, and glided off {{on the road for}} Cannes. Richard had become more serious. His boyish manner and {{appearance}} had temporarily gone. He drove, even, with less than his usual recklessness.|$|E
6000|$|Again Mrs Fyne {{assured me}} {{that it had been}} very trying. Terribly trying. [...] "Yes, thanks, I will." [...] She leaned back in the chair with folded arms while I poured another cup of tea for her, and Fyne went out to pacify the dog which, tied up under the porch, had become {{suddenly}} very indignant at somebody having the audacity to walk along the lane. Mrs Fyne stirred her tea for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, <b>drank</b> <b>a</b> little, put the cup down and said with that air of accepting all the consequences: ...|$|R
