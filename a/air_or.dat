5|$|Ethylene glycol {{has a low}} vapor pressure; it {{does not}} {{evaporate}} readily at normal temperatures and therefore high concentrations in <b>air</b> <b>or</b> intoxication are unlikely to occur following inhalational exposures. There may be a slight risk of poisoning where mists or fogs are generated, although this rarely leads to poisoning as ethylene glycol causes irritation and coughing when breathed in, alerting victims to its presence. Ethylene glycol is not well absorbed through skin meaning poisoning following dermal exposure is also uncommon.|$|E

5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{shielding}} gas in arc welding processes on materials that at welding temperatures are contaminated and weakened by <b>air</b> <b>or</b> nitrogen. A number of inert {{shielding gas}}es are used in gas tungsten arc welding, but helium is used instead of cheaper argon especially for welding materials that have higher heat conductivity, like aluminium or copper.|$|E

5|$|Holmium-chromium-thulium triple-doped Yttrium {{aluminum}} garnet (Ho:Cr:Tm:YAG, or Ho,Cr,Tm:YAG) is {{an active}} laser medium material with high efficiency. It lases at 2097nm and is widely used in military applications, medicine, and meteorology. Single-element thulium-doped YAG (Tm:YAG) lasers operate between 1930 and 2040nm. The wavelength of thulium-based lasers is very efficient for superficial ablation of tissue, with minimal coagulation depth in <b>air</b> <b>or</b> in water. This makes thulium lasers attractive for laser-based surgery.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the Port of Karachi {{housed the}} {{headquarters}} of the Pakistan Navy and almost its entire fleet was based in Karachi Harbour. Since Karachi was also the hub of Pakistan's maritime trade, a blockade would be disastrous for Pakistan’s economy. The security of Karachi Harbour was predominant to the Pakistani High Command and it was heavily defended against any <b>air</b> <b>or</b> naval strikes. The port's airspace was secured by the strike aircraft based at airfields in the area.|$|E

5|$|In the game, {{the player}} assumes control of American forces and must {{eliminate}} all Japanese forces around the atoll by <b>air</b> <b>or</b> naval combat. The Battle For Midway received largely negative reviews upon release. It was criticised for its incompatibility {{with black and}} white television sets, as the game was only accessible in a limited range of colours. The easy difficulty of the gameplay was also criticised.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is a {{reactive}} metal. In moist <b>air</b> <b>or</b> moist argon, {{the metal}} oxidizes rapidly, producing {{a mixture of}} oxides and hydrides. If the metal is exposed long enough to {{a limited amount of}} water vapor, a powdery surface coating of PuO2 is formed. Also formed is plutonium hydride but an excess of water vapor forms only PuO2.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the fate}} of Laos did not depend on a {{military}} solution in the <b>air</b> <b>or</b> {{on the ground in}} Laos and could only be decided by the outcome in Vietnam, winning the war against the DRV in northern Laos was not the objective.
