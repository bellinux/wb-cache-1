5|$|On January 15, 2013, then-reigning {{champion}} Rush voluntarily {{gave up the}} CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship {{as part of his}} ongoing storyline {{feud with}} then-CMLL World Heavyweight Champion El Terrible. As part of the storyline, El Terrible stated that he would not defend <b>against</b> <b>someone</b> who represented a lower weight class, so Rush moved into the Heavyweight division for a title match. CMLL held a 16-man torneo cibernetico elimination match to determine which two wrestlers should compete in the finals for the vacant title. On January 29, 2013, Rey Escorpión defeated Volador Jr. in the tournament finals to become the 13th overall champion.|$|E
5|$|Moncoutié all but {{clinched}} his mountains classification triumph {{on stage}} 15. While he finished nine minutes behind Cobo on Angliru, {{he won the}} day's second climb to score ten mountain points and increase his lead over Montaguti to 22 points. He scored his final mountain classification points on stage 17, ending {{with a total of}} 63. Montaguti nearly reclaimed the jersey on stage 18, when he made a breakaway and Moncoutié did not. Fortunately for Moncoutié, teammate Sijmens had made the escape group and kept Montaguti from maximum points on four of the five climbs. Given that riders who are not involved in a classification nor have teammates that are will generally not ride <b>against</b> <b>someone</b> who is, Sijmens' presence in this breakway was effectively the only way Moncoutié could have retained the jersey. Moncoutié continued to lead Montaguti, by a score of 63-56. Neither rider scored again, and Moncoutié won his fourth consecutive mountains title, a first in Vuelta history. He was the team's best overall finisher as well, but was not any real threat, coming in 37th overall at a deficit of over an hour to Cobo. Taaramäe, for his part, did not complete the Vuelta, abandoning on stage 17.|$|E

25|$|Early Medieval courts {{generally}} {{followed a}} process called accusatio, largely based on Germanic practices. In this procedure, an individual would make an accusation <b>against</b> <b>someone</b> to the court. However, if the suspect was judged innocent, the accusers faced legal penalties for bringing false charges. This provided a disincentive to make any accusation unless the accusers were sure it would stand. Later, a threshold requirement was {{the establishment of the}} accused's publica fama, i.e., the fact that the person was widely believed to be guilty of the offense charged.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} Greek text is legible {{on the whole}} (see {{transcription}} on the right), much of it remains incomprehensible due to grammatical and syntactical peculiarities, such as they were frequent in magical amulets, and some letter sequences cannot be made any sense of. Nonetheless, one can infer from the intelligible parts that the god Phoebus Apollo is being invoked {{in order to raise}} his arms <b>against</b> <b>someone</b> or something, probably to the advantage of the amulet owner. The wording does not correspond to any other ancient epigraphic and literary texts, providing further evidence that the gold foil is genuine and not a modern forgery.|$|E

In the early 1980s she had a public row with her former friend Allen Ginsberg over his support for child pornography and pedophilia, in which Ginsberg said, [...] "The right wants to put me in jail," [...] and Dworkin responded, [...] "Yes, they're very sentimental; I'd kill you." [...] In 1985, When Hustler published the claim that Dworkin advocated incest, Dworkin sued them for defamatory libel; the court dismissed Dworkin's complaint on the grounds that regardless of whether Hustlers interpretations of her reflections on incest were valid, even a faulty interpretation of a work placed into the [...] "marketplace of ideas" [...] could not amount to defamation in the legal sense.|$|E

Pieing is the act of throwing a pie at a person or people. This can be a political action when the target is an authority figure, politician, or celebrity {{and can be used}} as a means of protesting against the target's political beliefs, or against perceived arrogance or vanity. Perpetrators generally regard the act as a form of ridicule to embarrass and humiliate the victim. In most or all US jurisdictions, pieing is punishable as battery, and may constitute assault as well. Some political activists throw cream pies onto the faces of politicians to shame them and humiliate them (e.g., les Entartistes).|$|R

Nevertheless, media speculation about Sestak's possible campaign began as early as mid-April 2009, and intensified the day [...] Specter changed political parties. While most Democrats embraced the long-time Senator, Sestak issued a statement criticizing Specter's decision, declaring it an opportunist move that should have been made in consultation with Pennsylvanians rather than the Senate Democratic leadership and the Washington political establishment. Menendez approached Sestak again, this time asking him not to run against Specter, but Sestak did not agree to back down. Later, when asked by Fox News, Sestak insisted he had not decided whether he would run for the office, but declined to immediately endorse Specter and said he had to [...] "wait and see".

500|$|Left Behind {{was written}} {{to focus on}} the {{relationship}} between Ellie and Riley, and to recount the events that defined their later personalities. Riley was chronologically introduced to Ellie in , a comic book written by creative director Neil Druckmann and artist Faith Erin Hicks. The team used the comic as a reference point when developing the relationship between Ellie and Riley, becoming particularly interested in having the chance to see more of their relationship; Druckmann felt that they would not have developed Left Behind if American Dreams hadn't been written. Druckmann felt that the story of Joel and Ellie's relationship in The Last of Us dealt with survival, loyalty and love, and that Ellie and Riley's relationship in Left Behind deals with similar themes. Straley felt that the themes involve love, loss and devotion, pondering the extent that one goes to protect those one cares about. Ashley Johnson portrayed Ellie in Left Behind, reprising her role from The Last of Us. To portray Riley, the team cast Yaani King; Johnson has noted that it was interesting to act <b>against</b> <b>someone</b> different, and that King fit the role immediately. King felt intimidated to become part of a large project, and was worried about [...] "fit in". The team found it interesting {{to tell the story of}} Riley, as players of The Last of Us were already aware of the effect that she had on Ellie; Left Behind sees Riley's behavior change Ellie, resulting in the latter's focus to fight in order to save those close to her. The team were also interested in Ellie's behavior around Riley; she is perceived as being more playful. In Left Behind, Ellie and Riley share a kiss; the team explored omitting the kiss from the game, but felt that it was imperative to the story, and that it strengthened the relationship. Though initially he only felt that Ellie viewed Riley as an influence, Druckmann later considered her romantic appeal, and decided to explore the concept.|$|E
