500|$|In 2006, What's So Amazing About Grace? placed 17th on Christianity Todays list {{of fifty}} books that had most shaped Evangelicals. That year, Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, {{compared}} What's So Amazing About Grace? to Chuck Swindoll's book The Grace Awakening, calling both [...] "wonderful books on grace [...] did <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>service</b> rescuing {{the doctrine of}} grace from the legalists who say that we must earn our salvation". Christian professor Craig Detweiler writes in his 2008 book A Purple State of Mind: Finding Middle Ground in a Divided Culture that, {{if he could have}} given his students a graduation present, {{it would have been a}} copy of What's So Amazing About Grace? because many of his Christian students were more concerned with avoiding the forbidden than they were with enjoying the permitted. Detweiler writes that Christianity was founded on forgiveness and that Christians should not bear the burden of guilt, and he therefore agrees with Yancey that [...] "grace" [...] is [...] "our last best word".|$|E

500|$|Tripp {{wrote in}} the May 1982 issue of the Journal of Sex Research that Sexual Preference would likely be seen as [...] "a shock and a disappointment", since its authors {{abandoned}} many of Alfred Kinsey's methods and conclusions {{and in some cases}} even misrepresented them. Tripp criticized Bell et al. for ignoring Kinsey's warning to make careful observations and [...] "avoid theory", and for attempting to test the validity of psychoanalytic theories, which he considered already discredited by professionals. While Tripp nevertheless believed that Bell et al. had rendered <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>service</b> by showing that psychoanalytic theories are unsupported, he rejected their argument that since psychoanalytic ideas are incorrect the origins of sexual orientation must be genetic and hormonal, noting that in order to reason that way they had to ignore the work of sex researchers such as Frank Beach. Tripp also accused Bell et al. of citing low quality and unreplicated hormone studies, ignoring evidence relating homosexuality to early puberty, and substituting [...] "inductive for deductive methods". In the same issue, Bell et al. replied to Tripp′s review, accusing him of making false statements about their data analysis, misrepresenting their conclusions, and making [...] "ridiculous criticisms" [...] of the scientific method they had employed. Tripp responded in the November 1982 issue of the Journal of Sex Research, accusing Bell et al. of making personal attacks, and attempting to refute them on specific points.|$|E
2500|$|Gould {{said that}} the most {{positive}} review of the first edition was by the British Journal of Mathematical & Statistical Psychology, which reported that [...] "Gould has performed <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>service</b> in exposing the logical basis {{of one of the}} most important debates in the social sciences, and this book should be required reading for students and practitioners alike." [...] In The New York Times, journalist Christopher Lehmann-Haupt wrote that the critique of factor analysis [...] "demonstrates persuasively how factor analysis led to the cardinal error in reasoning, of confusing correlation with cause, or, to put it another way, of attributing false concreteness to the abstract". The British journal Saturday Review praised the book as a [...] "fascinating historical study of scientific racism", and that its arguments [...] "illustrate both the logical inconsistencies of the theories and the prejudicially motivated, albeit unintentional, misuse of data in each case". In the American Monthly Review magazine, Richard York and the sociologist Brett Clark praised the book's thematic concentration, saying that [...] "rather than attempt a grand critique of all 'scientific' efforts aimed at justifying social inequalities, Gould performs a well-reasoned assessment of the errors underlying a specific set of theories and empirical claims".|$|E
2500|$|Pure Mule {{received}} a favourable {{reaction from the}} critics, with some praising it for being the first RTÉ drama of the decade to portray issues such as Alzheimer's disease though locals said it portrayed midlanders in a bad light. Tom Parlon, a TD, spoke of the upset Pure Mules themes of cocaine and other issues caused to [...] "a lot of people" [...] in his constituency of Laois–Offaly, saying: It does make for uncomfortable viewing especially for someone like me whose has lived all their life in rural Ireland. But let's not be naive here. I believe the programme has also performed <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>service</b> by highlighting in stark and uncomfortable terms the challenges facing rural Ireland today in particular increased drug use amongst our young population. [...] Pure Mule has shown to all who watch it that young people {{in every corner of}} this country are experimenting with and using drugs on a large scale. Teenage sex and sexual promiscuity are other uncomfortable issues that are dealt with. It is fiction but it has also struck a raw nerve because it is telling an unpalatable truth. As a rural TD and as a parent, I believe what we are facing is a ticking time bomb in rural Ireland, where our young people feel increasingly dislocated from their community, where a lack of recreational and social outlets is fuelling the increase in drink and drug use. The last 20 years has brought unprecedented economic growth and social change across Ireland. What we must now do is face up to the social challenges.|$|E
