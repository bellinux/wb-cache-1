5|$|On signing for Roma, Marquinhos {{described}} himself as a quick player with <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> position who knew how to impose himself on a game. He named Thiago Silva as his role model. In March 2015, Marquinhos told FourFourTwo that despite his average height for a defender, he compensated with honing his strength and timing, attributes he learnt from PSG assistant manager Claude Makélélé. He praised manager Laurent Blanc, a former defender himself, for encouraging the PSG defenders to attack in set pieces and teaching them the correct positioning in that situation.|$|E

50|$|This size is {{also called}} the medium bamboo dog. It {{features}} a broad mouth, sturdy frame, muscular and strong, with <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell. It hunts well {{in the foothills of}} the bush and chases prey in the thick bush. Its prey are often badgers and foxes.|$|R
50|$|Australonuphis, {{commonly}} called Australian beach worms, are a genus of annelid commonly used as bait by anglers. Some species can grow {{more than a}} metre in length. They are blind but have <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell, and eat decaying meat, fish and seaweeds that have washed to shore.|$|R
5|$|The {{brain was}} {{slightly}} sigmoidal (S-shaped), without much {{expansion of the}} cerebral hemispheres, more like a crocodile than a bird. This {{is in keeping with}} the overall conservatism of non-coelurosaurian theropod brains. Acrocanthosaurus had large and bulbous olfactory bulbs, indicating <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell. Reconstructing the semicircular canals of the ear, which control balance, shows that the head was held at a 25° angle below horizontal. This was determined by orienting the endocast so that the lateral semicircular canal was parallel to the ground, as it usually is when an animal is in an alert posture.|$|E
5|$|The face appears wide due to ruffs of {{extended}} hair beneath the ears. Bobcat eyes are yellow with black pupils. The {{nose of the}} bobcat is pinkish-red, {{and it has a}} base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red on its face, sides, and back. The pupils are round, black circles and will widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception. The cat has sharp hearing and vision, and <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell. It is an excellent climber, and swims when it needs to, but normally avoids water. However, cases of bobcats swimming long distances across lakes have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. Unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell with which they locate carcasses. The turkey vulture has a red head. The black vulture has a grey head. Although not a water bird, a flock of black vultures at the Myakka River State Park, southeast of Sarasota, has been seen bathing {{at the edge of}} the lake and then drying out their wings in the same way as cormorants like the Florida anhinga. This habit may help free them of parasites.|$|E

50|$|Sea hares are herbivorous, and are {{typically}} found on seaweed in shallow water. Some young sea hares seemingly {{are capable of}} burrowing in soft sediment, leaving only their rhinophores and mantle opening showing. Sea hares have <b>an</b> extremely <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell. They can follow even the faintest scent using their rhinophores, which are extremely sensitive chemoreceptors.|$|R
5000|$|Stevens is {{affected}} by Cerebral Palsy, which, according to Stevens' site [...] "affects my speech, mobility, hand control, balance and continence to a significant degree and provided me with <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour." [...] Additionally, Stevens has been diagnosed as having mild bipolar and in 2009, Stevens had a nerve virus which resulted in long term Acute Neuropathy.|$|R
5|$|Skeletal {{elements}} of the upper jaw {{appear to have been}} rhynchokinetic (movable in relation to each other), which must have affected its feeding behaviour. In extant birds, such as frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons, kinetic premaxillae help with consuming large food items. The beak also appears {{to have been able to}} withstand high force loads, which indicates a diet of hard food. In 2016, the first 3D endocast was made from the brain of the dodo; examination found that though the brain was similar to that of other pigeons in most respects, the dodo had a comparatively large olfactory bulb. This gave the dodo <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell, which may have aided in locating fruit and small prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{auditory}} nerve was also large, suggesting good hearing, {{which may have}} been useful for auditory communication and spatial awareness. The nerve had a well-developed vestibular component as well, which implies <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> balance and coordination. In contrast, the nerves and brain structures associated with eyesight were smaller and undeveloped. The midbrain tectum, responsible for visual processing in reptiles, was very small in Tarbosaurus, as were the optic nerve and the oculomotor nerve, which controls eye movement. Unlike Tyrannosaurus, which had forward-facing eyes that provided some degree of binocular vision, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight.|$|E
5|$|While still a schoolboy, Massenet was {{admitted}} to France's principal music college, the Paris Conservatoire. There he studied under Ambroise Thomas, whom he greatly admired. After winning the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome, in 1863, he composed prolifically in many genres, but quickly became {{best known for his}} operas. Between 1867 and his death forty-five years later he wrote more than forty stage works {{in a wide variety of}} styles, from opéra-comique to grand-scale depictions of classical myths, romantic comedies, lyric dramas, as well as oratorios, cantatas and ballets. Massenet had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the theatre and of what would succeed with the Parisian public. Despite some miscalculations, he produced a series of successes that made him the leading composer of opera in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
40|$|E. Hipp. vv. 353 - 361 do {{not make}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> because <b>of</b> the phrase σώφρονες ούχ έκόντες, ὰλλ θμως κακων ερωσι. Yet, the {{information}} provided by manuscript tradition shows {{it to be a}} clear instance of double lecture, whose original variant κακων would be rightly accorded, as our opinion is, with Euripidean style, Greek syntax and dramatic situation...|$|R

[29] I forget, now, what I {{meant by}} 'liberty' in this passage; but I often {{used the word}} in my first writings, in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense,</b> {{thinking}} <b>of</b> Scott's moorland rambles and the like. It is very wonderful to me, now, to see what hopes I had once: but Turner was alive, then; and the sun used to shine, and rivers to sparkle.|$|R
25|$|C. perspicillata has <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell, <b>good</b> visual acuity, {{and they}} show less {{specialization}} in their auditory apparatus {{as opposed to}} insectivorous bats. However, they still employ echolocation as a primary method of orientation. They use calls that originate in their mouths or nostrils, which are intense, and {{have been shown to}} be the most directional sonar beams in any species of echolocating bat.|$|R
5|$|In 1989, Emily B. Griffin {{found that}} Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell (olfaction), {{based on the}} study of cranial endocasts that showed large {{olfactory}} bulbs in the brain. In 2014, Jason M. Bourke and colleagues found that Stegoceras would have needed cartilaginous nasal turbinates {{in the front of the}} nasal passages for airflow to reach the olfactory region. Evidence for the presence of this structure is a bony ridge to which it could have attached. The size of the olfactory region also indicates that Stegoceras had a keen sense of smell. The researchers found that the dinosaur could have had either a scroll-shaped turbinate (like in a turkey) or a branched one (as in an ostrich) as both could have directed air to the olfactory region. The blood vessel system in the passages also suggest that the turbinates served to cool down warm arterial blood from the body that was heading to the brain. The skull of S. validum specimen UALVP 2 was suited for a study of this kind due to its exceptional preservation; it has ossified soft tissue in the nasal cavity, which would otherwise be cartilaginous and therefore not preserved through mineralization.|$|E
5|$|The robust nasal bones, {{preserved}} {{in a single}} specimen, are widest at the front, a feature unusual among placentals that is also seen in armadillos, and are also unusually flat. The ethmoid labyrinth, in the nasal cavity, was large, suggesting that Plesiorycteropus had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell. A much larger part of the nasal septum, which separates {{the left and right}} nasal cavities, is ossified than usual in other mammals; MacPhee could find a similar condition only in sloths, which have a very short nose. The lacrimal bone is relatively large. At it is a single lacrimal canal, which opens near the suture between the frontal and lacrimal bones, like in lipotyphlans. There is a small tubercle (absent in aardvarks) near this opening. The orbital cavity, which houses the eyes, is relatively short, similar to the situation in pangolins and armadillos. A distinct tubercle is present on the suture between the frontal and parietal bones in P.germainepetterae, but not P.madagascariensis. P.madagascariensis has a more expansive braincase and a less pronounced narrowing between the orbits. The foramen rotundum, an opening in the bone of the orbit, is present. The optic canal, which houses the nerves leading to the eyes, is narrow, suggesting that the eyes were small, similar to many other tenrecoids. As in pangolins and xenarthrans, little of the squamosal bone can be seen from above. The temporal lines on the braincase, which anchor muscles, are located lower in P.germainepetterae. Like in aardvarks, the parietals are relatively large. An interparietal bone is present. Unlike in anteaters and pangolins, the occiput (the back of the skull) is flat and vertical. Plesiorycteropus lacks notches above the foramen magnum (the opening that connects the brain to the spinal cord), which are present in aardvarks. The nuchal crest, a projection on the occiput, is straight in P.madagascariensis, but in P.germainepetterae it is interrupted in the middle, similar to the situation in armadillos and hyraxes.|$|E

30|$|WSN had {{previously}} piloted two fixed network AMR systems in 2010 {{to assess the}} technical feasibility of deploying short-range fixed network AMR systems in Singapore’s high-rise residential estates (Toa Payoh, Punggol) and low-rise industrial estates (Tuas Industrial Estate). WSN had also successfully implemented AMR to acquire water consumption data from the top 100 commercial and industrial customers in 2014. The data from the first phase (Top 100) provided <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> the causes behind the fluctuations of Singapore’s daily demand, especially in analysing the increase in Singapore’s demand during the dry season. In the next phase, WSN will extend AMR to the Top 600 customers by Q 1 2016. The implementation costs of AMR remains high and WSN is exploring ways to lower these costs. The two key measures of AMR reliability are accuracy and reading availability and WSN is testing systems to evaluate this.|$|R
