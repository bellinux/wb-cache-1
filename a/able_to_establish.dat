5|$|Over {{the next}} two weeks more skirmishes {{occurred}} and the Allies were not able to cut off a major portion of the German forces, but the Germans were also not able to maintain any stable defense line as planned. On 10September forward units of the VI Corps were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> contact with units from Patton's Third Army. Truscott hoped to be able to push through the Belfort Gap, but on 14September he received orders from the Allied High Command to halt the offensive. Army GroupG was finally <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a stable defense line at the Vosges mountains, thwarting further Allied advances. This, combined with the Allied need to reorganise their command structure as the forces from northern and southern France have now linked up, forced the Allies to stop their pursuit of the Germans, ending the offensive here.|$|E
5|$|The {{cane toad}} was {{introduced}} to various Caribbean islands to counter a number of pests infesting local crops. While it was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> itself on some islands, such as Barbados, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico, other introductions, such as in Cuba before 1900 and in 1946, and on the islands of Dominica and Grand Cayman, were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|His {{research}} on plant evolution also progressed during this period; {{he worked on}} the genetics of forage grasses, looking at polyploidy and the evolution of the Poaceae and publishing numerous papers on the subject though the 1940s. He produced an artificial autotetraploid grass from the diploid species Ehrharta erecta through treatment with the chromosome doubling agent colchicine. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> the plant in the field, and after 39 years of field trials was able to show that the autopolyploid was not as successful as its diploid parent in an unchanging environment.|$|E

5|$|Kann {{asserts that}} she {{nevertheless}} possessed qualities appreciated in a monarch: warm heart, practical mind, firm determination and sound perception. Most importantly, {{she was ready}} to recognise the mental superiority of some of her advisers and to give way to a superior mind while enjoying support of her ministers even if their ideas differed from her own. Joseph, however, was never <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> rapport with the same advisers, even though their philosophy of government was closer to Joseph's than to Maria Theresa's.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was to commence {{at first light}} the next day, 10 September. The intervening time was spent securing the political and legal basis for the raid. Final approval was gained from Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Kabbah, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, while the Army Legal Corps secured approval from the Sierra Leonean Police. Fordham, who had been leading the negotiations, telephoned the West Side Boys and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> that the captive soldiers were alive, and the final orders were issued in the evening of 9 September.|$|E
5|$|Using the {{opportunity}} to rebuild their strength, the German Army in the West was able to accumulate a strength of around 500 tanks and assault guns by late September, despite prioritization of new equipment for the Eastern Front. This was {{in stark contrast to}} the estimated 100 which had been available before. German defenses along the Siegfried Line continued to strengthen, and the Wehrmacht was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a defensive depth of an average of , with the strongest defenses built opposite of Patton's Third Army.|$|E

5|$|Another theory by Shinhachiro Matsumoto {{suggests}} Noh {{originated from}} outcastes struggling to claim higher social status by catering {{to those in}} power, namely the new ruling samurai class of the time. The transferral of the shogunate from Kamakura to Kyoto {{at the beginning of}} Muromachi period marked the increasing power of the samurai class and strengthened the relationship between the shogunate and the court. As Noh became the shogun's favorite art form, Noh was able to become a courtly art form through this newly formed relationship. In 14th century, with strong support and patronage from shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, Zeami was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> Noh as the most prominent theatre art form of the time.|$|E
5|$|As {{the main}} attack {{developed}} on the 27th, the South Vietnamese General Assembly {{handed over the}} presidency to General Dương Văn Minh, who was sworn in the following day. It was widely assumed that Minh, who had no history of aggressive action against the communists, would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a cease-fire and re-open negotiations. Such hope was unrealistic. Their opponent, {{for the first time}} since the First Indochina War, held the upper hand on the battlefield and victory was within reach, regardless of any political changes in Saigon. They would not be denied victory, the only thing for which they had striven for over 30 years. The hope that the communists would make the same mistake they did 21 years prior by complying with the Geneva Agreements while the US and State of Vietnam did not was futile.|$|E
5|$|On 27 June 1978, {{three months}} after the revolution, Amin managed to outmaneuver the Parchamites at a Central Committee meeting. The meeting decided that the Khalqists had {{exclusive}} rights to formulate and decide policy, a policy which left the Parchamites impotent. Karmal was exiled, but was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a network with the remaining Parchamites in government. A coup to overthrow Amin was planned for September. Its leading members in Afghanistan were Qadir, the defence minister, and Army Chief of Staff General Shahpur Ahmedzai. The coup was planned for 4 September, on the Festival of Eid, because soldiers and officers would be off duty. The conspiracy failed when the Afghan ambassador to India told the Afghan leadership about the plan. A purge was initiated, and Parchamite ambassadors were recalled; few returned, for example Karmal and Mohammad Najibullah both stayed in their assigned countries.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} three months, Blake was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a network of earthen defences in Taunton, {{including}} a basic perimeter and several forts. The Royalists began the second, and bloodiest, siege in late March 1645, initially under Sir Richard Grenville. A series of disputes between the Royalist commanders allowed Taunton some respite {{at the start of}} the siege, but in May the attacks were fierce under the command of Sir Ralph Hopton. After five days of intense fighting, which had once again driven the defending army back to a small central perimeter including the castle, the Royalists retreated in the face of a Parliamentarian relief army commanded by Ralph Weldon.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth Colony {{was founded}} {{by a group of}} Puritan Separatists {{initially}} known as the Brownist Emigration, who {{came to be known as}} the Pilgrims. It was one of the earliest successful colonies to be founded by the English in North America, along with Jamestown and other settlements in Virginia, and was the first sizable permanent English settlement in the New England region. The colony was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a treaty with Chief Massasoit which helped to ensure its success; in this, they were aided by Squanto, a Native American of the Patuxet people. It played a central role in King Philip's War (1675–78), one of several Indian Wars. Ultimately, the colony was merged with the Massachusetts Bay Colony and other territories in 1691 to form the Province of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{were not}} able to hold Dijon and ordered a {{complete}} withdrawal from Southern France. Army GroupG retreated further north, pursued by Allied forces. The fighting ultimately came to a stop at the Vosges mountains, where Army GroupG was finally <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a stable defense line. After meeting with the Allied units from Operation Overlord, the Allied forces were in need of reorganizing and, facing stiffened German resistance, the offensive was halted on 14September. Operation Dragoon was considered a success by the Allies. It enabled them to liberate most of Southern France in a time span of only four weeks, while inflicting heavy casualties on the German forces, although a substantial part of the best German units was able to escape. The captured French ports were put into operation, allowing the Allies to solve their supply problems soon after.|$|E

5|$|The Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from {{granting}} injunctions {{against the}} Government {{or one of}} its officers. An injunction is an equitable private law remedy that restrains a public authority from doing an act that is wrongful or ultra vires.

At common law, there is no general right to claim damages – that is, monetary compensation – if rules of public law have been breached by an authority. In order to obtain damages, an aggrieved person must be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a private law claim in contract or tort law.|$|E
5|$|The area roughly {{located between}} the Danube, Tisza and Dniester rivers – {{approximately}} coinciding with modern-day Romania – became {{home to a}} varied group of Thracian peoples including Getae and Dacians sometime around the 7th to 6th centuries BC. The Getae and Dacians are related, but, distinct peoples that are sometimes treated as a single group {{under the name of}} Geto-Dacians. The Getae and Dacian peoples held many cultural and linguistic similarities. The Getae living in the lower Danube basin were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> regular trading commerce with the Greek cities along the coast of the Black Sea. The Dacians were located in the Carpatho-Danubian basin along the southern border of the Carpathian Mountains. This geographic isolation allowed the Dacians to survive catastrophic struggles – often with the Getae – and thrive to become the dominant tribe by the 1st century BC.|$|E
5|$|Warnings {{in reports}} from Vasco da Gama's voyage to India had {{prompted}} King Manuel I to brief Cabral regarding another port {{to the south}} of Calicut where he could also trade. This city was Kochi and the fleet set sail, reaching it on 24 December. Kochi was nominally a vassal of Calicut, as well as being dominated by other Indian cities. Kochi was eager to achieve independence, and the Portuguese were willing to exploit Indian disunity—as the British would three hundred years later. This tactic eventually ensured Portuguese hegemony over the region. Cabral forged an alliance with Kochi's ruler, as well with rulers of other Indian cities, and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a factory. At last, loaded with precious spices, the fleet went to Kannur for further trade before setting out on its return voyage to Portugal on 16 January 1501.|$|E
