40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the integration of}} heterogeneous network monitoring data. Specifically, we will synchronize and integrate flow-level records, exemplified by Cisco NetFlow, and packet-level traces, exemplified by NLANR PMA. The integration can facilitate cross-validation and complementary utility. However, finding the correspondences of timestamps/flows/packets between the PMA and Netflow is non-trivial, because they have different levels of granularity, different sampling strategy, different time sources, and different IP <b>address</b> <b>masking.</b> To integrate heterogeneous monitoring data, we first synchronize their timestamps, and then match their <b>masked</b> IP <b>addresses.</b> Our key observation is that although the IP <b>addresses</b> are <b>masked,</b> some other header fields can be exploited to match different types of monitoring data. In {{order to reduce the}} search space and the processing overhead, we have adopted a top-down approach to limit the search scope, and iterative algorithms to reduce the matching errors step by step...|$|R

50|$|A {{directly}} {{connected network}} is {{a network that}} is directly attached {{to one of the}} router interfaces.

40|$|Abstract-A formal {{mathematical}} model of single instruc-tion stream-multiple data stream (SIMD) machines is defined. It {{is used as}} a basis for analyzing various types of interconnection networks that have been discussed in the literature. The networks are evaluated in terms ofthe lower and upper bounds on the tune required for each of the networks discussed to simulate the other networks. SINM machine algorithms are presented as proofs of the upper time bounds on these simulation tasks. These simulations are used to demonstrate techniques for proving the correctness ofSIMD mach-ine algorithms, i. e., analyzing the simultaneous flow ofN data items among N processors. Processor <b>address</b> <b>masks,</b> a concise notation for activating and deactivating processors, are used in the algorithms. The methods used to prove the lower bounds and to construct (and prove correct) simulation algorithms to show the upper bounds can be generalized and applied to the analysis of other networks.

5000|$|Because of {{the privacy}} {{implications}} of exposing the IP address or hostname of a client, some IRC daemons also provide privacy features, such as InspIRCD or UnrealIRCD's [...] "+x" [...] mode. This hashes a client IP <b>address</b> or <b>masks</b> {{part of a}} client's hostname, making it unreadable to users other than IRCops. Users may also {{have the option of}} requesting a [...] "virtual host" [...] (or [...] "vhost"), to be displayed in the hostmask to allow further anonymity. Some IRC networks such as Freenode use these as [...] "cloaks" [...] to indicate that a user is affiliated with a group or project.|$|R

Some operating systems, such as OpenBSD with its W^X feature, and Linux with the Exec Shield or PaX patches, may also limit the length of the code segment, as specified by the CS register, to disallow execution of code in modifiable regions of the address space.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a methodology for the design, testing {{and assessment of}} incipient failure detection techniques for failing components/systems of critical engineered systems/processes masked or hidden by feedback control loops. It is recognized that the optimum operation of critical assets (aircraft, autonomous systems, industrial processes, etc.) may be compromised by feedback control loops, which mask severe fault modes while compensating for typical disturbances. Detrimental consequences of such occurrences include the inability to detect expeditiously and accurately incipient failures, loss of control, and inefficient operation of assets {{in the form of}} fuel overconsumption and adverse environmental impact. A novel control-theoretic framework is presented to <b>address</b> the <b>masking</b> problem. Major elements of the proposed approach are employed in simulation to develop, implement and validate how faults are distinguished from disturbances and how faults are detected and identified with performance guarantees, i. e. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{numerous}} paintings, Longhi depicts masked figures {{engaging in}} various acts from gambling to flirting. For example, {{in the foreground}} of Longhi’s painting The Meeting of the Procuratore and His Wife are {{a woman who is}} being greeted by a man that is presumed to be her husband. The setting is of a type of gathering place usually for masked people to engage in private matters such as romantic encounters. The woman and her husband are unmasked, but at the left a seated woman is unmasking herself to <b>address</b> a <b>masked</b> man leaning over her shoulder. This act may suggest that the woman’s Moretta mask, which lacks an opening for the mouth, requires her to unmask herself in order to speak; another interpretation is that the woman is interested enough in the masked man to remove her mask in order to reveal her true identity to him.|$|R
5000|$|Multiple client devices {{can appear}} to share an IP address, {{either because they}} are part of a shared hosting web server {{environment}} or because an IPv4 network address translator (NAT) or proxy server acts as an intermediary agent on behalf of the client, in which case the real originating IP <b>address</b> might be <b>masked</b> from the server receiving a request.

25|$|After parsing a PXE enabled DHCP server DHCPOFFER, {{the client}} {{will be able}} to set its own network IP <b>address,</b> IP <b>Mask,</b> etc., and to point to the network located booting resources, based on the {{received}} TFTP Server IP address {{and the name of the}} NBP. The client next transfers the NBP into its own random-access memory (RAM) using TFTP, possibly verifies it (i.e. UEFI Secure Boot), and finally boots from it. NBPs are just the first link in the boot chain process and they generally request via TFTP a small set of complementary files in order to get running a minimalistic OS executive (i.e. WindowsPE, or a basic Linux kernel+initrd). The small OS executive loads its own network drivers and TCP/IP stack. At this point, the remaining instructions required to boot or install a full OS are provided not over TFTP, but using a robust transfer protocol (such as HTTP, CIFS, or NFS).|$|R

40|$|Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) {{provides}} a means of allocating and managing IP addresses dynamically over a network. An important characteristic of the DHCP server is that different hosts or network cards {{are not allowed to}} simultaneously use the same IP address in the DHCP mechanism. However, anyone can guest corresponding parameters such as IP <b>address,</b> subnet <b>mask,</b> and default gateway from the DHCP mode, and then reconfigure a static IP to access the network from DHCP mode. According to the DHCP mechanism, this study traces abnormalities of the client IP or MAC address by comparing the ARP table and DHCP binding table in this paper. This work performs the proposed method to detect abnormal hosts on both DHCPv 4 and DHCPv 6. The difference between these two tables provides illegality information to transmit to relevant routers or switching devices via the DHCP server to block the illegal user from accessing network resources. This study approach requires no source address or MAC address retrieval of the packet. This work significantly improves system performance by effectively blocking illegal users before packets transmit. </p...|$|R
