50|$|Leased {{lines are}} more {{expensive}} than alternative connectivity services including (ADSL, SDSL, etc.) because they are reserved exclusively to the leaseholder. Some internet service providers have therefore developed alternative products that aim to deliver leased-line type services (Carrier Ethernet-based, zero contention, guaranteed availability), with more moderate bandwidth, over the standard UK national broadband network. While a leased line is full-duplex, most leased line alternatives provide only half-duplex or in many cases <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe socio-medical care {{of elderly}} {{patients}} tends to develop as an <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>service</b> relationship during which healthcare providers tend to (re) configure patients’ identities. The {{main purpose of}} this research is to propose a guardian conception of elderly patients’ identities, viewed as a process through which resource persons substitute them in making decisions on their behalf, and thus tailor their identities...|$|E

40|$|This study employs {{fuzzy set}} {{qualitative}} comparative analysis (fsQCA) to examine <b>asymmetrical</b> relationships among <b>service</b> attributes, relationship quality, and customer loyalty {{in the airline}} industry. The study incorporates customers’ demographics and psychological variables to model customer loyalty. Customer loyalty is operationalised as behavioural and attitudinal dimensions in order to capture customers’ actual behaviours and behavioural intentions. Symmetrical testing {{is also used to}} compare findings with those from fsQCA application. The study provides various causal recipes or configurations for predicting relationship quality and customer loyalty. The comparison between symmetrical and asymmetrical findings presents deeper and more insightful information. These findings provide useful guidelines and references for the relevant researchers and practitioners. The study also contributes to the literature by utilising symmetrical and asymmetrical tools to advance understanding of antecedent conditions of relationship quality and customer loyalty.

40|$|Telecommunication {{services}} have existed {{as a legal}} monopoly nearly throughout its entire history. In 1998, telecom market liberalisation was achieved across the European Union (EU) through the introduction of competition among telephone <b>services.</b> <b>Asymmetrical</b> obligations were deemed {{necessary in order to}} compensate the market power of the former monopolist. As the evolution of asymmetrical regulation in Spain illustrates, obligations and the telecommunications operators subject to them increased with the regulatory framework established in 2002 in the EU. This new regulatory framework may continue to expand through the inclusion of functional separation as another possible asymmetrical obligation. In short, it seems that the regulatory pressure on the telecommunications industry is increasing, despite the lapse in time since the liberalisation of the industry. In this paper, a methodology developed by the Austrian School of Economics is applied in order to explain why the telecommunication market is subject to increasing regulation in Europe, rather than deregulation, after more than 10 years of liberalisation. In particular, Mises's theory of price control is used to explain the evolution of the regulation of local loop unbundling.
