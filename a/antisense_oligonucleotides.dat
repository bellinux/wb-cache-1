5|$|Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS) are {{modified}} oligonucleotides {{where one}} of the oxygen atoms in the phosphate moiety is replaced by sulfur. Only the phosphorothioates having sulfur at a non-bridging position as shown in figure are widely used and are available commercially. The replacement of the non-bridging oxygen with sulfur creates a new center of chirality at phosphorus. In a simple case of a dinucleotide, this results in the formation of a diastereomeric pair of Sp- and Rp-dinucleoside monophosphorothioates whose structures are shown in Figure. In an n-mer oligonucleotide where all (n– 1) internucleosidic linkages are phosphorothioate linkages, the number of diastereomers m is calculated as m = 2(n– 1). Being non-natural analogs of nucleic acids, OPS are substantially more stable towards hydrolysis by nucleases, the class of enzymes that destroy nucleic acids by breaking the bridging P-O bond of the phosphodiester moiety. This property determines the use of OPS as <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> in in vitro and in vivo applications where the extensive exposure to nucleases is inevitable. Similarly, to improve the stability of siRNA, at least one phosphorothioate linkage is often introduced at the 3'-terminus of both sense and antisense strands. In chirally pure OPS, all-Sp diastereomers are more stable to enzymatic degradation than their all-Rp analogs. However, the preparation of chirally pure OPS remains a synthetic challenge. In laboratory practice, mixtures of diastereomers of OPS are commonly used.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of a new {{biocompatible}} block copolymer poly(2 -(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate-N-(morpholino) ethyl methacrylate (PDMAEMA-b-PMEMA) for the delivery of a particular <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> targeting E 6 gene from human papilloma virus. This <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> was derivatized with a polyazaaromatic Ru(II) complex which, under visible illumination, is able to produce an irreversible crosslink with the complementary targeted sequence. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine whether by {{the use of}} a suitable transfection agent, it is possible to increase the efficiency of the <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> targeting E 6 gene, named Ru-P- 4. In a recent study, we showed that Oligofectamine transfected Ru-P- 4 <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> failed to inhibit efficiently the growth of cervical cancer cell line SiHa, contrarily to the Ru-P- 6 <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide,</b> another sequence also targeting the E 6 gene. The ability of PDMAEMA-b-PMEMA to form polyplexes with optimal physicochemical characteristics was investigated first. Then the ability of the PDMAEMA-b-PMEMA/Ru-P- 4 <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> polyplexes to transfect two keratinocyte cell lines (SiHa and HaCat) and the capacity of polyplexes to inhibit HPV 16 + cervical cancer cell growth was evaluated. PDMAEMA-b-PMEMA base polyplexes at the optimal molar ratio of polymer nitrogen atoms to DNA phosphates (N/P), were able to deliver Ru-P- 4 <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> and to induce a higher growth inhibition in human cervical cancer SiHa cells, compared to other formulations based on Oligofectamine.

Since then, the advent of bioinformatics approaches combined with genome tiling studies examining the transcriptome, systematic sequencing of full length cDNA libraries and experimental validation (including the creation of miRNA derived <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> called antagomirs) have revealed that many transcripts are non protein-coding RNA, including several snoRNAs and miRNAs.|$|E
25|$|The recent {{progress}} in uncovering the molecular mechanisms of toxic progerin formation in laminopathies leading to premature aging {{has opened up}} {{the potential for the}} development of targeted treatment. The farnesylation of prelamin A and its pathological form progerin is carried out by the enzyme farnesyl transferase. Farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) can be used effectively to reduce symptoms in two mouse model systems for progeria and to revert the abnormal nuclear morphology in progeroid cell cultures. Two oral FTIs, lonafarnib and tipifarnib, are already in use as anti-tumor medication in humans and may become avenues of treatment for children suffering from laminopathic progeria. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphate drugs used in the treatment of osteoporosis reduce farnesyldiphosphate production and thus prelamin A farnesylation. Testing of these drugs may prove them to be useful in treating progeria as well. The use of <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> to inhibit progerin synthesis in affected cells is another avenue of current research into the development of anti-progerin drugs.|$|E

40|$|We {{undertook}} {{the present}} study to clarify the molecular mechanism {{of the effect of}} a new anti-cancer drug, vesnarinone, on a human salivary gland cancer cell line, TYS. We isolated TSC- 22 cDNA as avesnarinone-inducible gene from a cDNA library constructed from vesnarinone-treated TYS cells. TSC- 22 was originally reported as a transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta-inducible gene. The expression of TSC- 22 was up-regulated within a few hours after treatment with vesnarinone and was continued for 3 days. The level of TSC- 22 mRNA in TYS cells was continuously increased until the cells reached confluency. Furthermore, the induction of TSC- 22 by vesnarinone was inhibited by treatment with cycloheximide. When we treated the cells with an <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> against TSC- 22 mRNA under quiescent conditions, the <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> stimulated the growth of TYS cells; however, under growing conditions the <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> did not affect cell growth.

2500|$|The {{existing}} HCV therapy of PEG-IFNα plus ribavirin {{is poorly}} tolerated and frequently ineffective, {{so there is}} an urgent need for new drugs, and miR-122 inhibitors are an attractive possibility. The association between low miR-122 levels and hepatocellular carcinoma suggests that caution will be necessary when testing miR-122 inhibitors, and that long term treatment might be undesirable. However, miR-122 is a promising target {{as it can be}} very selectively and effectively inhibited with <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides,</b> and as it is a conserved host factor it is hoped that the virus {{would not be able to}} acquire resistance mutations to an anti-miR-122 therapeutic.Moreover, engineering HepG2 cells to express miR-122 (HepG2-HFL cell, HepG2 cells expressing miR-122) mount an effective antiviral interferon-lambda (IFNλ) based innate immune response to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

40|$|Abstract The {{prognosis}} of pancreatic carcinoma is poor due to {{the difficulty}} in early diagnosis, insensitivity to routine therapies and limited understanding of its pathological mechanisms.

50|$|The {{mechanism}} behind exon skipping is a mutation specific <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> (AON). An <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> is a synthesized short {{nucleic acid}} polymer, typically fifty or fewer base pairs in length that will bind to the mutation {{site in the}} pre-messenger RNA, to induce exon skipping.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{blocking}} {{the expression of}} c-fos in the rostral ventral medulla (RVM) on the control of arterial blood pressure was determined. In six male Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), unilateral injection of an <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> to c-fos mRNA suppressed the expression of Fos-like immunoreactivity in neurons in the RVM in response to inhibition of depressor neurons in the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM). Under pentobarbital anesthesia the mean arterial pressure of rats injected with <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> (n = 10) bilaterally into RVM was significantly reduced after 6 h compared with sense-treated controls (n = 9) (76. 5 ± 3. 7 vs. 92. 4 ± 3. 5 mmHg; P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Furthermore, the pressor response to bilateral injection of muscimol into CVLM was significantly smaller in rats injected with <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> 6 h earlier (n = 6) compared with sense-treated controls (n = 6) (changes in mean arterial pressure, + 40. 3 ± 3. 6 vs. + 68. 7 ± 4. 8 mmHg, P 3 ̆c 0. 005). These studies demonstrate that expression of c-fos in the RVM can be blocked in vivo by treatment with an <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide,</b> and that basal and stimulated expression of the c-fos gene {{is important in the}} central control of arterial blood pressure...|$|R
50|$|Gene {{silencing}} {{can be used}} {{to treat}} HD by targeting the mutant huntingtin protein.

40|$|Background & Aims: Defective {{transforming}} {{growth factor}} (TGF) -Î² 1 signaling {{due to high}} levels of Smad 7 is a feature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this study, we analyzed the effect of reducing Smad 7 levels with <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> on mouse models of colitis. Methods: Mucosal samples taken from colitic tissue of mice with colitis due to either haptenating reagents (trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid [TNBS] or oxazolone) or to transfer of T cells (SCID transfer colitis) were analyzed for Smad 3 and/or Smad 7 expression by Western blotting and, in some cases, content of TGF-Î² 1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effect of oral Smad 7 <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> on mucosal inflammation was assessed. Results: TGF-Î² 1 levels were increased in the inflamed tissues of mice with colitis induced by either TNBS or oxazolone. Nevertheless, TGF-Î² 1 did not exert a regulatory effect, probably because TGF-Î² 1 signaling was blocked, as indicated by the presence of reduced Smad 3 phosphorylation and high levels of Smad 7. Oral administration of Smad 7 <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> to colitic mice restored TGF-Î² 1 signaling via Smad 3 and ameliorated inflammation in hapten-induced colitis. In addition, Smad 7 <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> had a therapeutic effect on relapsing TNBS-induced colitis but not on cell-transfer colitis. Conclusions: These data suggest that colitis models associated with high endogenous TGF-Î² 1 levels and defective TGF-Î² 1 signaling due {{to high levels of}} Smad 7 can be ameliorated by down-regulation of Smad 7 and by oral administration of Smad 7 <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide.</b> This may represent a new approach to the control of IBD, particularly during active phases when its Smad 7 profile resembles that of hapten-induced colitis.

Using an inhibitor of astrocyte proliferation, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and the glial mitogen endothelin (ET- 3), we sought a common pathway for growth regulation in these neural cells. In cultured fetal rat diencephalic astrocytes, ANP selectively and rapidly inhibited the Tis 8 immediate early gene and protein. After 4 h, ANP selectively inhibited the {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF) gene and protein. ET- 3 significantly stimulated both Tis 8 and bFGF mRNAs and protein, but also stimulated several other immediate early and growth factor/receptor genes.
