In this paper, we report on the use of SCF amplifiers for the amplification of cylindrically polarized laser beams, as such beams offer promising properties for numerous applications. While the amplification of cylindrically polarized beams is challenging with other amplifier designs due to thermally induced depolarization, we demonstrate the amplification of 32 W cylindrically polarized beams to an output power of 100 W. A measured degree of radial polarization after the SCF of about 95 % indicates <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>conservation</b> of polarization...|$|R

International audiencePatient derived xenografts (PDXs) are increasingly appreciated models in cancer research, particularly for preclinical testing, as they reflect the patient's tumor biology more accurately than cancer cell lines. We have established a collection of 20 breast PDXs and characterized their biological and clinical features, as well as their genetic stability. While most PDXs originated from triple negative breast cancers (70 %), our collection comprised five ER + cases (25 %). Remarkably, the tumors that produced PDXs derived from a subset of aggressive breast cancers with a high proportion of grade 3 tumors and reduced recurrence-free survival. Consistent with this, we found significant differences between the transcriptomic signatures of tumors that produced a PDX (Take) and those that did not (No Take). The PDXs faithfully recapitulate the histological features of their primary tumors, and retain <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>conservation</b> of molecular classification assignment and Copy Number Change (CNC). Furthermore, the CNC profiles of different PDXs established from the same tumor overlap significantly. However, a small fraction of CNCs in the primary tumor that correspond to oligoclonal events were gradually lost during sequential passaging, suggesting that the PDXs' genetic structure eventually stabilizes around a dominant clone present in the tumor of origin. Finally, de novo occurring genetic events covering up to 9 % of the genome were found in only a minority of the PDXs, showing that PDXs have limited genetic instability. These data show that breast cancer PDXs represent a subset of aggressive tumors prone to relapse, and that despite of <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>conservation</b> of original features, they remain genetically dynamic elements...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contains}} the preliminary {{results of the}} study of the Sauveterrian layers located in the north-western side of site 1, sector III of Mondeval de Sora. Situated {{in the heart of the}} Dolomites (South-Western Alps, Italy) at an altitude of about 2. 150 mt, this deposit - as well as sector I located under the opposite side of the same erratic boulder - represents a key site for the study of occupation and exploitation patterns of mountain areas on the Southern slope of the Alps during the early Holocene. Actually the two deposits are characterised by <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>conservation</b> of the archaeological record, as testified by the presence of two stratigraphic series in which organic materials are preserved in association with the lithic industry. From an economic point of view, the most interesting aspect concerning sector III is the great variety of faunal resources, which are dominated by wild caprines followed by species which are typical of a wooded habitat, such as red deer, roe deer and wild boar. The preliminary data resulting from the interdisciplinary study allow this site to be considered as a seasonal camp occupied by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers for the exploitation of the surrounding territory and where the main activities performed seem to include the preparation of microliths to be used as hunting projectiles and probably the processing of animal carcasses...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the ability to prolong the useful life of the minimally processed ‘Fuji’ apple by applying the individual or combined additives (L-cysteine chloride, L-ascorbic acid and calcium chloride) and to determine the appropriate period of storage of the whole fruit to perform the minimum processing. The experimental design was completely randomized in three-factor design with three replications. Factor A was composed of storage periods of whole apples, pre-processing, in cold chambers (20, 78, 138 and 188 days); the factor B was represented by storage periods minimum post-processing, simulating shelf life (3, 6, 9 and 12 days), and factor C was represented by chemical additives (distilled water, as control, 0. 5 % L-cysteine chloride, 1 % L-ascorbic acid, 0. 5 % L-cysteine chloride along with 1 % calcium chloride and 1 % L-ascorbic acid together with 1 % calcium chloride). The evaluated dependent variables were pulp color (L* and hº), soluble solids, titratable acidity, content of phenolic compounds, antioxidant capacity and quantification of polyphenol oxidase. In addition, was analyzed the presence or absence of Salmonella sp. and Escherichia coli. The prolongation of the storage time of ‘Fuji’ apples in a refrigerated atmosphere promotes increased susceptibility to browning and softening after processing from 78 days of storage. The use of additives in the process, helps prevent these problems, especially when combined 0. 5 % L-cysteine chloride with 1 % calcium chloride, achieving <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>conservation</b> in refrigerated shelf up to 6 days. From a microbiological aspect, minimally processed apples are toxicologically safe...|$|R
40|$|The {{conservation}} of the linear order (colinearity) of genetic markers along large chromosome segments in wheat and rice is well established, but less {{is known about}} the microcolinearity between both genomes at subcentimorgan distances. In this study we focused on the microcolinearity between a 2. 6 -cM interval flanked by markers Xcdo 365 and Xucw 65 on wheat chromosome 6 B and rice chromosome 2. A previous study has shown that this wheat segment includes the Gpc- 6 B 1 locus, which is responsible for large differences in grain protein content (GPC) and is the target of a positional cloning effort in our laboratories. Twenty-one recombination events between Xcdo 365 and Xucw 65 were found in a large segregating population (935 gametes) and used to map 17 genes selected from rice chromosome 2 in the wheat genetic map. We found a high level of colinearity between a 2. 1 -cM region flanked by loci Xucw 75 and Xucw 67 on wheat chromosome 6 B and a 350 -kb uninterrupted sequenced region in rice chromosome arm 2 S. Colinearity between these two genomes was extended to the region proximal to Xucw 67 (eight colinear RFLP markers), but was interrupted distal to Xucw 75 (six non-colinear RFLP markers). Analysis of different comparative studies between rice and wheat suggests that microcolinearity is more frequently disrupted in the distal region of the wheat chromosomes. Fortunately, the region encompassing the Gpc- 6 B 1 locus showed <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>conservation</b> between the two genomes, facilitating the saturation of the target region of the wheat genetic map with molecular markers. These markers were used to map the Gpc- 6 B 1 locus into a 0. 3 -cM interval flanked by PCR markers Xucw 79 and Xucw 71, and to identify five candidate genes within the colinear 64 -kb region in rice. © Springer-Verlag 2004...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nearly {{one-quarter of}} all avian species is either {{threatened}} or nearly threatened. Of these, 73 species {{are currently being}} rescued from going extinct in wildlife sanctuaries. One of the previously most critically-endangered is the crested ibis, Nipponia nippon. Once widespread across North-East Asia, by 1981 only seven individuals from two breeding pairs remained in the wild. The recovering crested ibis populations thus provide <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> example for <b>conservation</b> genomics since every individual bird has been recruited for genomic and demographic studies. RESULTS: Using high-quality genome sequences of multiple crested ibis individuals, its thriving co-habitant, the little egret, Egretta garzetta, and the recently sequenced genomes of 41 other avian species that are under various degrees of survival threats, including the bald eagle, we carry out comparative analyses for genomic signatures of near extinction events in association with environmental and behavioral attributes of species. We confirm that both loss of genetic diversity and enrichment of deleterious mutations of protein-coding genes contribute to the major genetic defects of the endangered species. We further identify that genetic inbreeding and loss-of-function genes in the crested ibis may all constitute genetic susceptibility to other factors including long-term climate change, over-hunting, and agrochemical overuse. We also establish a genome-wide DNA identification platform for molecular breeding and conservation practices, to facilitate sustainable recovery of endangered species. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate common genomic signatures of population decline across avian species and pave a way for further effort in saving endangered species and enhancing conservation genomic efforts...|$|R

As a result, American and Least Bitterns, King Rail, Common Moorhen, and several American Coot nests in Sarpy Co were reported. However, Great and Snowy Egrets were scarce, and Black-necked Stilts were absent from the eastern Rainwater Basin after several good breeding years there. First breeding records for the state are always exciting; Lesser Goldfinch finally took the plunge this year in Banner Co. Also encouraging were increased reports of Black-billed Cuckoo (9) and both Black-billed Magpie and Black-capped Chickadee.

40|$|The {{decomposition}} and {{accumulation of}} organic materials in submerged (anaerobic) soils and sediments differ considerably {{from those in}} their aerobic counterparts. This {{is caused by the}} lack of oxygen or anaerobiosis. Compared to aerobic soils, there is preferential accumulation of organic matter in submerged rice soils. This paper reviews the current literature to establish basis or bases for organic matter accumulation in wetland soils and sediments. The decomposition or destruction of organic materials is lessened and incomplete, and the humification of organic matter is decreased under flooded conditions. Consequently, the overall organic matter decomposition rates are slower in submerged soils than those in aerobic soils and this results in net accumulation of organic matter in soils or sites that remain flooded for several years. Also, high organic matter soils or Histosols are developed in permanently waterlogged sites or soils because the rate of organic matter destruction is slower than its accumulation. The balance between organic matter inputs and decomposition is the primary determinant of organic matter accumulation or depletion. Several hypotheses have been postulated to explain the accumulation of organic matter in submerged soils. They include the deleterious effects on microbial activity of reduction products produced such as hydrogen sulfide or volatile fatty acids and toxic concentrations of ammonia, aluminium, iron, and other cations in soil solution. The absence of electron acceptors such as iron oxides and hydroxides in submerged soils and sediments slows down organic matter oxidation and mineralization. Formation of recalcitrant complex organic molecules with organic matter fractions, e. g., through enrichment of organic matter with phenolics in intensified irrigated rice production system, may render them less available for microbial attack and utilization. Moreover, the net primary productivity of wetlands is higher than other ecosystems. There is need for further research to fully understand the mechanism(s) involved in the accumulation of organic matter in submerged soils as wetlands offer <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> example of <b>conservation</b> and maintenance of organic matter and storage of organic C...|$|R
