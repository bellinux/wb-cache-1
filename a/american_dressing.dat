40|$|African Americans have an {{interest}} in their cultural and ethnic heritage. One method of gaining information about African American heritage is by examining historical images of African American women in relation to appearance. Unfortunately sources pertaining to African American appearance are limited. The purpose of this research was to use descriptions of appearance (dress and the body) in slave narratives, define themes relative to appearance, and assess aspects of appearance of African American persons during the period of slavery in North America. Content analysis and Bathes 2 ̆ 7 system for analyzing written garments were used to collect data from the references to appearance (dress and the body) in the slave narratives written by African American women. A purposive sample of ten slave narratives was subjected to both methods of data collection. Findings included the identification of binary themes that provided meanings of African <b>American</b> slave <b>dress</b> in the narratives. These included poverty/wealth, utilities/luxuries, purity/impurity, sadness/cheerfulness, conspicuous/inconspicuous, and comfortable/uncomfortable. Three superordinate categories emerged: Status, Physical Well-Being and Psychological Well-Being. Two theoretical models emerged from the research: (1) Symbols of African <b>American</b> <b>Dress</b> in Female Slave Narratives which described the binary themes describing African <b>American</b> slave <b>dress</b> and (2) Symbolic Meaning of Appearance of African American Slaves in the Nineteenth Century United States which described the interconnectedness of the superordinate themes describing the meanings of African American slave appearances. The Conditional Matrix of African American Slaves in Nineteenth Century Slave Narratives was constructed to evaluate the superordinate themes. The contribution of this study is the understanding of symbols of African <b>American</b> <b>dress</b> and appearance and the construction of grounded theory with applicability to the study of communicative effects of African <b>American</b> <b>dress</b> and appearance at other social times and social contexts and for male clothing. ...|$|R

50|$|Many African Americans {{enjoyed the}} popular {{music from the}} ragtime era. Their sense of style in {{clothing}} seemed to reflect this. Whereas the mostly Caucasian <b>American</b> upper class <b>dressed</b> in clean and light colored fabric (often cream or white), the African <b>Americans</b> <b>dressed</b> in bright and vibrant clothing when they attended clubs that played ragtime music. Whereas the upper class clothing was form-fitting, their clothes were loose, which allowed for free and easy movement. Women often adorned their hair with colorful flowers as accessories, and men often wore vests and bowler hats as their accessories.|$|R

One just automatically knows what spacesuits look like, the same way one intuitively knows how <b>Americans</b> <b>dress.</b> I {{had never been to}} the United States, but I had this fixed idea of how people looked there. Americans wore polyester so their clothes wouldn't crease, and their trousers were a bit too short. Since they're very keen on sports, white socks and white T-shirts played an integral part in their wardrobe. Of course, since doing Rocky I have been to the United States and admit {{it was a bit of}} a generalization, but my ideas worked perfectly for Brad and Janet." ...|$|R
50|$|In the 20th century, early {{portrayals of}} Native Americans {{in movies and}} {{television}} roles were first performed by European <b>Americans</b> <b>dressed</b> in mock traditional attire. Examples included The Last of the Mohicans (1920), Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans (1957), and F Troop (1965-67). In later decades, Native American actors such as Jay Silverheels in The Lone Ranger television series (1949-57) came to prominence. Roles of Native Americans were limited and not reflective of Native American culture. By the 1970s some Native American film roles began to show more complexity, {{such as those in}} Little Big Man (1970), Billy Jack (1971), and The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), which depicted Native Americans in minor supporting roles.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the 1994-95 school year, the university's {{nickname}} was the St. John's Redmen, which referenced the red uniforms worn by its {{teams in}} competition.

The change happened {{at a time when there}} was mounting pressure on colleges and universities to adopt names more sensitive to Native American culture.

He, however, makes a huge mistake as Colonel Buckner tells him that the squad he shot at actually consisted of <b>Americans</b> <b>dressed</b> in Nazi uniform {{who were supposed to}} accomplish an important mission.

But I remembered he didn't seem drunk before. It was some queer. So I watched that young man.|$|R
