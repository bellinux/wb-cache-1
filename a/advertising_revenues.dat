His father poured {{over a million dollars}} into {{the newspaper}} in 1924–1925, but Johnson's involvement led to a rightward shift in the newspaper, which alienated many readers. In April 1926, Johnson concluded that the Illustrated Daily News and the two other newspapers that Vanderbilt had founded in other cities could survive if $300,000 more were invested in them; however, the elder Vanderbilt refused to provide any more money. A petition for receivership was filed on May 3, 1926.|$|E

Votes made via {{landline}} telephones or from the Red Button service cost 35 pence each, with calls made from mobile telephones expected to be more expensive.

25|$|It was {{initially}} believed that Paul Martin's Liberals would win {{a majority of}} seats in Quebec {{at the expense of}} the Bloc, but the Liberal Party's fortunes were instead damaged by the sponsorship scandal, in which some <b>advertising</b> <b>revenues</b> approved by the Chrétien government to promote Canadian federalism in Quebec were found to have been misused.

The Signals competitor at the time was the Minden Democrat, and the two publications contested for legal <b>advertising</b> <b>revenues</b> from the various governmental entities. Fuller sold The Signal in 1894 to James Peter Kent, and then re-purchased it in 1917.

25|$|But, {{despite the}} industry's accolades and {{publishing}} America's {{mission to the}} moon in 1969, the magazine continued to lose circulation.

Life was reportedly not losing money, but its costs were rising faster than its profits. Life lost credibility with many readers when it supported author Clifford Irving, whose fraudulent autobiography of Howard Hughes was revealed as a hoax in January 1972.

It was a weekly newspaper which had the exclusive rights of publishing Government announcements and advertisements affording it an increased circulation and the potential of increased <b>advertising</b> <b>revenues</b> from other sources. In 1815 the Government transferred these rights to the Bengal Military Orphan Society in order to provide an income for the charity as well as providing the orphans with a potential trade. The new paper was named the Government Gazette and was thenceforth printed from the Orphan Society’s Press. Atkinson became the Editor of the new Government Gazette in 1815 and in 1817 the Superintendent of the Press.|$|E
25|$|The {{decline in}} <b>advertising</b> <b>revenues</b> {{affected}} both the print and online media {{as well as}} all other mediums; print advertising was once lucrative but has greatly declined, and the prices of online advertising are often lower than those of their print precursors. Besides remodeling advertising, the internet (especially the web) has also challenged the business models of the print-only era by crowdsourcing both publishing in general (sharing information with others) and, more specifically, journalism (the work of finding, assembling, and reporting the news). In addition, the rise of news aggregators, which bundle linked articles from many online newspapers and other sources, influences the flow of web traffic. Increasing paywalling of online newspapers may be counteracting those effects. The oldest newspaper still published is the Ordinari Post Tijdender, which was established in Stockholm in 1645.|$|E
