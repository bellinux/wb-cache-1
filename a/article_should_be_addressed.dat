40|$|We readwith {{particular}} interest the short reviewand opinion by Lippi et al {{about the potential}} cardiovascular risk of using e-cigarettes. 1 It is our opinion that certain aspects presented in the <b>article</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> further <b>addressed</b> and clarified. The potential risk for cardiovascular disease from e-cigarette use was mainly attributed by the authors {{to the effects of}} nicotine. However, several studies have shown that nicotine intake does not elevate cardiovascular risk. Long-term inhalation of nicotine was studied in animals; research-ers did not observe any adverse effects on the lungs or development of atherosclerosis. 2 A recent meta-analysis of controlled smoking cessation trials found that, although nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) had a higher rate of any cardiovascular events, this was driven only by minor events such as heart palpitations; no elevation in the inci...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{examined}} {{the consequences of}} witnessing interparental psychological aggression in childhood for daily conflict processes in adult intimate relationships. Both partners in 73 heterosexual couples provided daily diary reports of relationship conflict over a 28 -day period. Partners’ reports of witnessing mother-to-father and father-to-mother psychological aggression were used to predict exposure to daily relationship conflicts and reactivity to those conflicts (as reflected in end-of-day anger). Results showed no evidence of exposure effects: Witnessing interparental psychological aggression was unrelated {{to the number of}} conflict days reported by either partner. Reactivity effects emerged for males only, with father’s aggression predicting increased reactivity and mother’s aggression predicting the opposite. However, we found evidence of direct or unmediated effects of This research {{was supported in part by}} a National Institute of Mental Health grant ROI-MH 60366.

40|$|The {{individual}} best {{qualified to}} design an empirical study {{is one who}} is (a) most familiar {{with the nature of}} the phenomenon and research area, (b) most familiar with the possible alternative methods for designing and analyzing the study, and (c) most capable of evaluating the potential advantages and disadvantages of the alternatives (Chartrand & Ellis, 1999). Our intent with the collection of articles in Advanced Quantitative Meth-ods in Counseling Psychology 1 and 2 was to better equip researchers with knowledge to choose among alternative research designs and statistical pro-cedures. We seek here to highlight the major contributions of each article and to identify several themes common across articles. We organize our presenta-tion into three sections: implications for research practice, implications for training and teaching, and implications for practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH PRACTICE We break this section into the following four subsections to parallel the organizational framework of the special issues: substantive theory, research design, measurement, and analysis. Also, in this section, we elucidate seven themes. The overarching theme championed by all authors is the importance of sound critical thinking and reasoned argument in designing and conduct-ing empirical research. As Tracey and Glidden-Tracey (1999) note, the fail-ure to advance knowledge is largely due to uncritical thinking and a lack of Both authors contributed equally to this <b>article.</b> Correspondence <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> to eithe...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Individual {{differences}} in personality may be described at three different levels. Level I consists of those broad, decontextualized, and rela-tively nonconditional constructs called "traits, " which provide a dispositional signature for personality description. No {{description of a}} person is adequate without trait attributions, but trait attributions themselves yield little beyond a "psychology ofthe stranger. " At Level II (called "personal concems"), per-sonality descriptions invoke personal strivings, life tasks, defense mechanisms, coping strategies, domain-specific skills and values, and a wide assortment of other motivational, developmental, or strategic constructs that are contextual-ized in time, place, or role. While dispositional traits and personal concerns appear to have near-universal applicability. Level III presents frameworks and constructs that may be uniquely relevant to adulthood only, and perhaps only within modern societies that put a premium on the individuation of the self. Thus, in contemporary Western societies, a full description of personality commonly requires {{a consideration of the}} extent to which a human life ex-presses unity and purpose, which are the hallmarks of identity. Identity in adulthood is an inner story of the self that integrates the reconstmcted past, perceived present, and anticipated future to provide a life with unity, purpose, and meaning. At Level III, psychologists may explore the person's identity as an internalized and evolving life story. Each of the three levels has its own geography and requires its own indigenous nomenclatures, taxonomies, theories, frameworks, and laws. One of the great social rituals in the lives of middle-class American famihes is "the drive home. " The ritual comes in many different forms.

40|$|Identity. The {{pattern of}} intercorrelations between the {{dimensions}} provided sup-portive evidence of its construct validity. To a lesser extent, evidence of predictive validity was also observed. When compared with {{findings from the}} original study using African Americans, two important differences were noted. First, levels of centrality were lower in the current sample suggesting that racial identity is less critical to one’s self-concept among Black Britons than their American counter-parts. Second, centrality and nationalist ideology were negatively associated {{with the amount of}} time spent with Whites in the American sample but were unre-lated to this criterion in the British sample. Attempts to explain these findings ex-plored both methodological and theoretical considerations. Psychological research into ethnicity has traditionally focused on inter-group conflict, and particularly on attitudes of majority toward minority group members, at the expense of ethnic identity (i. e., how members within minority groups relate to each other) (Phinney, 1990). Emerging differences between ethnic groups in terms of educational and occupational achievement led to social movements designed to increase ethnic awareness and pride (Laosa, 1984). In terms of psychological functioning, ethnic identity has evolved as a theoretically pivotal variable, a view attested to by the literary contributions of Malcolm X (1965) and others depicting their struggle for self-understanding (Phinney, 1990). Kaplan’s (1989) prophetic claim that many European countries would be dealing for years to come with ethnic AUTHOR’S NOTE: I would like to thank four anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments regarding the original <b>article.</b> All correspondence <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> to James J.
