In October, Stefani revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the album and started again, since [...] "t didn't feel right. [...] I didn't feel fulfilled. That record with Benny was done that way because I had just given birth and had just started on The Voice and felt like I should do something in music, but what was I going to do? There wasn't enough time. So I {{tried to make a}} record where I was just kind of involved—which is how <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> it, but it didn't work for me". She later told Zane Lowe that she had attempted to curate an entire album, but it did not feel right and she needed to write her own material. She also revealed that she felt inspired again and started writing a lot of songs in a rapid progression, revealing: [...] "I think I have enough for probably two albums. [...] I have to write a few more songs, because I feel like, might as well keep going while it's there. [...] I got 20 songs. I have a whole record in eight weeks, but I want to keep writing." [...] Stefani also revealed she had worked with musicians Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Greg Kurstin, in addition to production duo Mattman & Robin and the Stargate production team. The album was completed in January 2016. Stefani revealed in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres on February 25 that [...] "'four of five' songs" [...] were written in the previous month.|$|E

[...] The episode {{was the first to}} be directed by Joss Whedon. [...] Whedon, who is a friend of both producer Greg Daniels and Jenna Fischer, and also met most of the production staff prior to the episode, stated that he chose to direct the episode [...] "because I already know the writing staff and a bunch of the cast, and I adore the show." [...] When informed that the episode was about a bat entering into the office and one of the characters pretending to be a vampire, Whedon thought that it was a joke, stating [...] "Didn't I just leave this party?" [...] in reference to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. [...] In an interview featured on the third season DVD, Whedon joked that the [...] "Business School" [...] episode and his former TV show were very similar because [...] "Buffy [...] was sad and depressing but... it was funny. Especially when people died. And <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> die in [...]" [...] But upon completing the episode, Whedon stated [...] "That was just coincidence. But that's how that happened. God, it was fun." [...] Whedon stated that he was surprised with the amount of input he was allowed with the script. [...] "I wouldn't say freedom to do things with it...But way more input was asked for than I would have ever anticipated." [...] At Pam's art show, the pieces which she was supposed to have painted didn't suit Whedon. [...] "I got to the set and saw Pam's art, and I was like, 'This is not right.'" [...] Whedon said that he held up filming for over an hour until the staff was able create new pieces of art.|$|E

Phillipps said that Daniel was excited to spend time with Paul and believed that he could help him with his grief. He continued, [...] "I think Daniel is really happy to just be settled for a while because he is road-tripping. Paul has been grieving over Kate's death, so they are a really good match for each other right now. Their relationship is really strong." [...] Dennis asked for Paul and Daniel's first scene to be rewritten as he wanted to establish their strong relationship from the beginning. The original script saw Paul failing to recognise his nephew. Dennis took his worries to the writers who agreed to change the scenes. Phillipps stated that Paul and Daniel have [...] "a great uncle and nephew relationship" [...] and thought they were a good pairing, as they both wanted to be good influences on each other.

Daniel decided to stay in Erinsborough and try and redeem his uncle. He told Ellis, [...] "Daniel finds it bizarre that Paul isn't well liked, because he is all about the love!" ...|$|E
