5|$|The second part, Debt and Sin, {{explores the}} {{theological}} side, including moral or ethical characteristics attributed to debtors and creditors by society and religion. Debt, like certain vices, such as cigarette-smoking, have experienced {{times when it}} was considered sinful, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>times</b> fashionable. Biblical references, like the Book of Deuteronomy, the Lord's Prayer, and sin-eating, are examined. The growth of debt {{is linked to the}} growth of the written media with the relationship symbolized by the Faustian contract with the devil.|$|E
5|$|The {{designs for}} Pokémon are often highly {{analogous}} to real-life creatures, but also encompass inanimate objects. Director Junichi Masuda and graphic designer Takao Unno {{have stated that}} inspiration for Pokémon designs can come from anything. The variety of animals and culture across the world {{provide the basis for}} countless ideas to be incorporated into the franchise. The environment a Pokémon would live in is taken into account when they are designed. The lei-like Comfey fits appropriately in the Hawaii-inspired Alola region of Sun and Moon. Masuda has stated that each element of a design has a functioning reason. In some cases, the design team creates a footprint that a Pokémon could make and designs a creature around that. Some designers look to game mechanics for inspiration, seeing where particular typing combinations could be interesting. Typing assignment varies during the design process, sometimes a Pokémon receives a type after it is created <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>times</b> they are designed around a particular type.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Dolly was a {{short-lived}} and disorganized tropical cyclone that caused moderate damage across Tamaulipas, Mexico, in early September2014. Originating from a tropical wave, the system first became a tropical depression late on September1 while situated over the Bay of Campeche. Dolly struggled against strong wind shear {{for the duration}} of its existence. The large system featured multiple circulations, sometimes becoming a new dominant center <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>times</b> simply rotating around a mean vortex. As a result, multiple center relocations occurred along its general west-northwest track. Dolly eventually made landfall in Tamaulipas on September3 before degenerating into a remnant low. The system subsequently dissipated the following day.|$|E

25|$|Commentators such as Leo Strauss {{have gone}} so far as to name Machiavelli as the {{deliberate}} originator of modernity itself.

25|$|Credit for {{the concept}} of {{training}} Chinese in Western military tactics and arming them with the best available weaponry is sometimes given to Ward, other times to Li Hongzhang, a local Imperial commander “ordered to cooperate with — {{and keep an eye}} on — Ward's unruly contingent” <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>times</b> to Burgevine, who according to some began the training while Ward was recuperating, having been inspired by the sight of a Chinese gun crew acting under French direction.|$|E
25|$|Defenders of the Talmud {{argue that}} many of these criticisms, {{particularly}} those in antisemitic sources, are based on quotations that are taken out of context, and thus misrepresent the meaning of the Talmud's text.

25|$|Scholars claim {{politics}} also drives {{rural-urban migration}} and subsequent settlement patterns. Pre-existing patronage networks, {{sometimes in the}} form of gangs <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>times</b> {{in the form of}} political parties or social activists, inside slums seek to maintain their economic, social and political power. These social and political groups have vested interests to encourage migration by ethnic groups that will help maintain the slums, and reject alternate housing options even if the alternate options are better in every aspect than the slums they seek to replace.|$|E

25|$|Fall {{migration}} of the northernly birds takes place from July to September, and {{they return to}} the breeding grounds between March and May.

25|$|Shortly {{after its}} launch, The Disney Channel aired {{a program called}} D-TV, a play on the MTV acronym. The program used music cuts, both from current and past artists.

The specials tended to air both on The Disney Channel and NBC. The program aired at various times between 1984 and 1999.
