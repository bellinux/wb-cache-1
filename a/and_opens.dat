5|$|Chapter 3 is short, <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> {{with a list}} {{of eight}} asanas (postures), {{followed}} by the description of each one. The asanas are of two types: one set is for meditative contemplation, and the other for cleansing the body. Both are said to be important in the journey of yoga. Different asanas focus on different organ groups. Of the eight asanas, the text discusses two variations each for the Swastikasana and the Mukta Sirsasana in verses 3.3–5 and 3.13–14 respectively, with claims that each asana helps cleanse the body when these are practiced with Yamas and Niyamas.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper empirically {{investigates the}} impact of trading {{activity}} including trading volume <b>and</b> <b>open</b> interest on price volatility in Asian futures exchanges. Trading volume <b>and</b> <b>open</b> interest represent market information for investors. This study uses three different definitions of volatility: (1) daily volatility measured by close-to-close returns, (2) non-trading volatility measured by close-to-open returns, and (3) trading volatility measured by open-to-close returns. The impact of trading volume <b>and</b> <b>open</b> interest on price volatility is investigated. Following Bessembinder and Seguin (1993), volume <b>and</b> <b>open</b> interest are divided into expected and unexpected components. The GARCH (1, 1) model is employed using expected and unexpected components of trading activity (volume <b>and</b> <b>open</b> interest) as explanatory variables. The results show a positive contemporaneous relationship between expected and unexpected trading volume <b>and</b> volatility, while <b>open</b> interest mitigates volatility. Policy makers can use these findings to suggest to investors that trading activity (volume <b>and</b> <b>open</b> interest) is a proxy of market information flowing to exchanges, especially unexpected trading activity. New information flowing to exchanges can mostly be noticed in unexpected trading volumes <b>and</b> <b>open</b> interests...|$|R

5|$|Molluscs' circulatory {{systems are}} mainly open. Although {{molluscs}} are coelomates, their coeloms {{are reduced to}} fairly small spaces enclosing the heart and gonads. The main body cavity is a hemocoel through which blood and coelomic fluid circulate and which encloses {{most of the other}} internal organs. These hemocoelic spaces act as an efficient hydrostatic skeleton. The blood contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin as an oxygen-carrier. The heart consists of one or more pairs of atria (auricles), which receive oxygenated blood from the gills and pump it to the ventricle, which pumps it into the aorta (main artery), which is fairly short <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> into the hemocoel.|$|E

5|$|On the mandible, the {{diastema}} is {{very large}} and the incisor is procumbent (projecting forward), which distinguishes Apeomyoides from most eomyids apart from Megapeomys. There is a masseteric scar (associated with the jaw muscles) from below the m1 forward to a point in front of p4, below the mental foramen, {{an opening in the}} jawbone. In Apeomys and Megapeomys this scar only reaches {{to the level of the}} front root of p4. The mental foramen is very small <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> in the diastema, near the ventral shelf of the scar; in Apeomys and Megapeomys it is located near the dorsal shelf. Further foramina are present on the lingual (inner) surface of the bone, below the cheekteeth.|$|E

5|$|A {{structure}} {{with the same}} name is often found in invertebrates, including molluscs and arthropods, connecting the oral cavity with the stomach. In terms of the digestive system of snails and slugs, the mouth opens into an esophagus, which connects to the stomach. Because of torsion, which is {{the rotation of the}} main body of the animal during larval development, the esophagus usually passes around the stomach, <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> into its back, furthest from the mouth. In species that have undergone de-torsion, however, the esophagus may open into the anterior of the stomach, which is the reverse of the usual gastropod arrangement. There is an extensive rostrum at the front of the esophagus in all carnivorous snails and slugs. In the freshwater snail species Tarebia granifera, the brood pouch is above the esophagus.|$|E
