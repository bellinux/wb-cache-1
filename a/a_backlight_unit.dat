5000|$|This is a {{technique}} for expanding the contrast of LCD-screens. LCD-screens comprise <b>a</b> <b>backlight</b> <b>unit</b> which is permanently emitting light and an LCD-panel {{in front of it}} which modulates transmission of light with respect to intensity and chromaticity. In order to increase the contrast of such LCD-screens the backlight can be (globally) dimmed when the image to be displayed is dark (i.e. not comprising high intensity image data) while the image data is numerically corrected and adapted to the reduced backlight intensity. In such a way the dark regions in dark images can be improved and the contrast between subsequent frames can be substantially increased. Also the contrast within one frame can be expanded intentionally depending on the histogram of the image (some sporadic highlights in an image may be cut or suppressed). There is quite some digital signal processing required for implementation of the dynamic contrast control technique {{in a way that is}} pleasing to the human visual system (e.g. no flicker effects must be induced).|$|E

One way of reducing the power dissipation of a mobile liquid-crystal display (LCD) is to efficiently distribute and outcouple the light available in the <b>backlight</b> <b>unit</b> (BLU) to direct the light in a spectrum-specific fashion through the respective color pixels. This paper describes a diffractive optics approach to realize <b>a</b> novel <b>backlight</b> <b>unit.</b> <b>A</b> model grating structure was fabricated and the outcoupled distribution of light was studied.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new technique for generating homogeneously distributed irregular dot patterns useful for optical devices and digital halftoning technologies. To introduce irregularity, we use elaborately designed sequences called low-discrepancy sequences instead of pseudorandom numbers. We also use a moleculardynamics redistribution method to improve the distribution of dots. Our method can produce arbitrary density distributions in accordance with a given design. The generated patterns are free from visible roughness {{as well as any}} moiré patterns when superimposed on other regular patterns. We demonstrate that our method effectively improves luminance uniformity and eliminates moiré patterns when used for <b>a</b> <b>backlight</b> <b>unit</b> of a liquid-crystal display. © 2003 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 230. 0230, 230. 3720, 230. 3990, 100. 2810, 100. 2980. 1...|$|E

Most other manufacturers utilized an LCD screen that was not visible without backlight.

40|$|A dual layer LCD {{display is}} able to achieve a high dynamic range by {{stacking}} two liquid crystal panels {{one on top of}} the other over <b>an</b> enhanced <b>backlight</b> <b>unit.</b> However, the finite distance between the two panels inevitably introduces a parallax error when the display is observed off-axis, and the dynamic range limitations of the individual panels introduce a reconstruction error near sharp edges in the input image. In Part I, we have formulated the image splitting as a constrained optimization problem in which a joint minimization of the parallax error and the visibility of the reconstruction error is performed. In this Part II, we describe one possible numerical method which solves the optimization problem at a low computational cost. We also describe in more detail the characteristics of the prototype display which has been built by FIMI-Philips. We finally present some results and an evaluation of the errors introduced by the proposed splitting algorithm...|$|R

40|$|As the {{technology}} evolves, end-users are stuffed with {{many kinds of}} handheld devices along with {{an enormous number of}} interactive multimedia applications and communication functionalities. These devices consume much power, especially for displaying their services or functions. In contrast, the battery, which is the main power supplier for such devices, has a much lower capacity growth compared to the power demands. This gap has inspired many researchers to study low-power display techniques. In the mean time, there came the invention of a light emitting diode (LED) as <b>a</b> new <b>backlight</b> source for <b>a</b> display panel. LEDs have been adopted in the most widely used Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) system. This paper focuses on recent noticeable low-power display techniques based on LCD systems, especially associated with <b>an</b> LED <b>backlight</b> <b>unit</b> as its light source. We categorize these techniques into four groups: 1) low-power techniques with backlight dimming, 2) low-power techniques with dynamic voltage scaling, 3) software-based low-power techniques, and 4) hardware-based low-power techniques, and review the core of each technique briefly. Among many techniques, concurrent brightness and contrast scaling technique in a color sequential LED-backlit display system achieved the largest power saving ratio by up to 90 &#x 0025; of the total system power with a small distortion level. As future research, it is one of important methods to combine the pros from each beneficial technique into one synergistically in the aspect of the whole system power...|$|R

Due to recent advances in electronics, lighting and communication technologies, SMART Televisions (TV) have become more affordable, and are rapidly eplacing old-fashioned LCD (liquid crystal display) TV technologies. These TVs are nearly ten times thinner; they include much brighter displays, true-color ualities, at least two times faster refresh rates and smart communication features. While providing such advanced features, lighting has become a critical part of technology advancement. While the <b>backlight</b> <b>unit</b> consumes over 50 % of total energy in TVs, light emitting diodes (LEDs) have rapidly replaced the conventional CCFL (Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp) based LCD <b>backlight</b> <b>units</b> due to their low energy consumption. The present study identifies the impact of optical solutions with high-power LEDs located {{at the corner of the}} <b>backlight</b> <b>unit</b> on the optical efficiency for an advanced TV system. Various optical designs are created and impacting metrics for novel LED <b>backlight</b> <b>units</b> are determined. <b>A</b> computational and experimental study has been performed to identify the optical-thermal interactions in a tight-space LED packaging for a slim TV. Optical modeling has been performed via Light Tools optical simulation software, while thermal modeling was performed via Icepak CFD software. Smart optical packaging resulted in an effective light distribution of minimum 75 % brightness uniformity, with no MURA effect problem on the panel The thermal challenge was found to be immense; so a smart thermal packaging was vital. An experimental validation of computational models was also performed. While the target is obtaining a uniform light distribution generated by HB (high brightness) LEDs and reduction of cost by having fewer LEDs, optical structure is found to be very critical in terms of both optical efficiency and pattern design of the light guide plate (LGP), which is an essential part of slim LED TVs. The study is concluded with a detailed discussion of the impact on lum- nance uniformity and cost for advanced SMART TVs.
