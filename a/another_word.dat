5|$|Ancient texts use ahimsa to mean non-injury, {{a broader}} concept than non-violence. Non-injury implies not killing others, {{as well as}} not hurting others mentally or verbally; it {{includes}} avoiding all violent means—including physical violence—anything that injures others. In classical Sanskrit literature of Hinduism, <b>another</b> <b>word</b> Adrohi is sometimes used instead of Ahimsa, {{as one of the}} cardinal virtues necessary for moral life. One example is in Baudhayana Dharmasutra 2.6.23: वाङ्-मनः-कर्म-दण्डैर् भूतानाम् अद्रोही (One who does not injure others with words, thoughts or acts is named Adrohi).|$|E

25|$|Pandeism is <b>another</b> <b>word</b> {{derived from}} pantheism, and is {{characterized}} as a combination of reconcilable elements of pantheism and deism.

25|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{particles}} in Arabic, al- is always prefixed to <b>another</b> <b>word</b> {{and it never}} stands alone. Consequently, most dictionaries will not list it as a separate word, and it is almost invariably ignored in collation. Similarly, al- is not a permanent component of the word {{to which it is}} prefixed. It is added and removed to toggle between the definiteness and indefiniteness of the word.|$|E

25|$|Morphological {{dependencies}} obtain between {{words or}} parts of words. When a given word or part of a word influences the form of <b>another</b> <b>word,</b> then the latter is morphologically dependent on the former. Agreement and concord are therefore manifestations of morphological dependencies. Like semantic dependencies, morphological dependencies can overlap with and point {{in the same direction}} as syntactic dependencies, overlap with and point in the opposite direction of syntactic dependencies, or be entirely independent of syntactic dependencies. The arrows are now used to indicate morphological dependencies.|$|E

25|$|A belt {{could also}} be {{fastened}} over a simple tunic-like garment or undergarment, just below the breasts or over the breasts. When the apodesmos was worn under the breasts, it accentuated them. <b>Another</b> <b>word</b> for a breast-band or belt was strophion (Gr: στρόφιον). A further term was kestós (Gr: κεστός, Latin: cestus), used specifically for Aphrodite's charmed girdle in the Iliad, whose power was to make every woman who wore it irresistible to men. In view of its association with the love goddess, this type of garment probably had an erotic connotation because of its effect to accentuate the breast.|$|E
25|$|When a word precedes <b>another</b> <b>word</b> {{beginning}} with a vowel, assimilation or deletion ('elision') {{of one of the}} vowels often takes place. In fact, since syllables in Yoruba normally end in a vowel, and most nouns start with one, it is a very common phenomenon, and it is absent only in very slow, unnatural speech. The orthography here follows speech in that word divisions are normally not indicated in words that are contracted as a result of assimilation or elision: ra ẹja → rẹja 'buy fish'. Sometimes however, authors may choose to use an inverted comma to indicate an elided vowel as in ní ilé → n’ílé 'in the house'.|$|E
25|$|A {{reasonably}} {{complete list}} of uncontroversial so-called minimal pairs can be seen below. The two words in each pair are distinguished solely by having different tone (acute vs. grave). In those cases where both words are nouns {{it would have been}} possible to list the genitive forms of the words as well, thereby creating <b>another</b> <b>word</b> pair, but this has been avoided. A few word pairs where one of the words is a plural form with the suffix -or have been included. This {{is due to the fact}} that a vast majority of Swedish-speakers in all parts of Sweden pronounce the suffix -or the same way as -er.|$|E

As in a north east miner saying 'Marra, ye keep way from me if ye usin a divvy.' It seems the word divvie then translated to daft lad/lass. Perhaps coming from the fact one would be seen as foolish going down a mine with a Scotch Divvy when there are safer lamps available, like the Geordie, or the Davy.|$|E

To {{still be able}} to collect specimen of Japanese plants and animals as well as to gather information on the population, Thunberg soon began to systematically construct networks with the interpreters by sending them small notes containing medical knowledge and receiving botanical knowledge or rare Japanese coins in return. Quickly, the news spread that a well-educated Dutch physician was in town who seemed {{to be able to help}} the local doctors cure the Dutch disease, <b>another</b> <b>word</b> for syphilis. As a result, the appropriate authorities granted him more and more visits to the city and finally even allowed him one-day trips into the vicinity of Nagasaki where Thunberg had the chance to collect specimen by himself.|$|E
25|$|The word gamelan {{comes from}} the low Javanese word gamel, which may refer to a type of mallet used to strike {{instruments}} or the act of striking with a mallet. The term karawitan refers to classical gamelan music and performance practice, and {{comes from the}} word rawit, meaning 'intricate' or 'finely worked'. The word derives from the Javanese word of Sanskrit origin, rawit, which refers {{to the sense of}} smoothness and elegance idealized in Javanese music. <b>Another</b> <b>word</b> from this root, pangrawit, means a person with such sense, and is used as an honorific when discussing esteemed gamelan musicians. The high Javanese word for gamelan is gangsa, formed either from the words tembaga and rejasa referring to the materials used in bronze gamelan construction (copper and tin), or tiga and sedasa referring to their proportions (three and ten).|$|E

25|$|In {{the ancient}} Celtic world Anu {{was the mother}} goddess and {{considered}} to be the mother of all the gods; the Tuatha de Danann. Other references say that she is the mother earth goddess or the Goddess of fertility. On the Cork Kerry border are two mountains called the Paps of Anu (pap is <b>another</b> <b>word</b> for breast.) On the top of each mountain are stone structures or cairns that when viewed from a distance make the two mountains look like a pair of breasts. Anu was known, in the Celtic World, by several similar names: Danu or Don being the most popular alternatives. She was a Mother-Goddess, the wife of the Sun God, Belenos, and {{considered to be the}} ancestor of all the Gods, the Tuatha dé Danann, who found themselves obliged to reside in the Otherworld when Miled brought the Celts to the British Isles. She still looks down on us from the night's sky where she appears as Llys Don, better known as the constellation of Casseopeia.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, when recalling word pairs, {{there is}} an {{intrusion}}. An intrusion is an error that participants make when they attempt to recall a word based on a cue of that word pair. Intrusions tend to have either semantic attributes {{in common with the}} correct word not recalled or have been previously studied in <b>another</b> <b>word</b> pair on the current list or a previously studied list or were close in time to the cue item. When two items are similar, an intrusion may occur. Professor Kahana and Marieke Vugt at the University of Pennsylvania examined the effects of face similarity for face-name associations. In the first experiment, they wanted to determine if performance of recall would vary with the number of faces in the study set that were similar to the cue face. Faces were similar if the radius of the faces were within a range. The number of faces within a radius is called a neighborhood density. They found that the recall of a name to face exhibited a lower accuracy and slower reaction time for faces with a greater neighborhood density. The more similarity that two faces have, the greater the probability for interference between the two faces. When cued with face A, name B may be recalled if face A and B are similar, which would signify that an intrusion has occurred. The probability of correct recall came from the number of faces that had other similar faces.|$|E
