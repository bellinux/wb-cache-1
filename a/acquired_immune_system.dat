25|$|The {{adaptive}} immune system, {{also known}} as the <b>acquired</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> or, more rarely, as the specific immune system, is a subsystem of the overall immune system that is composed of highly specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminate pathogens or prevent their growth. The adaptive immune system is one of the two main immunity strategies found in vertebrates (the other being the innate immune system). Adaptive immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, and leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination. Like the innate system, the adaptive system includes both humoral immunity components and cell-mediated immunity components.|$|E
25|$|The major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) {{is a set of}} cell surface proteins essential for the <b>acquired</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> to recognize foreign molecules in vertebrates, which in turn determines histocompatibility. The main function of MHC molecules is to bind to antigens derived from pathogens and display them on the cell surface for recognition by the appropriate T-cells. MHC molecules mediate interactions of leukocytes, also called white blood cells (WBCs), which are immune cells, with other leukocytes or with body cells. The MHC determines compatibility of donors for organ transplant, as well as one's susceptibility to an autoimmune disease via crossreacting immunization. The human MHC is also called the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) complex (often just the HLA). The mouse MHC is called the H-2 complex or H-2.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Heterophils are {{important}} mediators of innate resistance in poultry, especially in young birds {{that have not}} yet developed an <b>acquired</b> <b>immune</b> response. Invasion of the intestinal mucosa by Salmonella spp. initiates the recruitment of large numbers of heterophils to the lamina propria. Thus, the heterophilic response can control, but not eliminate, bacterial num-bers in the bird until development of acquired immu-nity. Unfortunately, chicks and turkey poults are highly susceptible to Salmonella infections during the first 4 d posthatch due to the functional immaturity of both the innate and <b>acquired</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems.</b> We have previ-ously shown that the administration of Salmonella enteritidis (SE) -immune lymphokines (ILK) into either 18 -d-old developing embryos or day-of-hatch chicks an...|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of action for reducing the numbers of C. perfringens may differ from that previously explained for bacteria with type-1-fimbriae. Research in other species has demonstrated that MOS {{has an effect on}} intestinal morphology as well as both innate and <b>acquired</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> components, which may help to explain the observed reductions in C. perfringens. Research shows an increase in serum lymphocytes and lower plasma neutrophils when adult dogs were supplemented with MOS and FOS. These findings indicate an improvement in immunity that, in turn, gives rise to increased protection against intestinal pathogens.|$|E
50|$|Once a {{bacterium}} or virus overcomes the body's innate immune system, the host organism's <b>acquired</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> will take over. This immune response is highly specific to pathogens {{and provides the}} host with long-lasting immunity against future infection by that specific pathogen. When lymphocytes recognize antigens presented on a pathogen's surface, they will secrete antibodies that bind to the pathogen and alert macrophages and natural killer cells. These cells target the pathogen itself, killing it or rendering it inactive. This process further produces memory B cell and memory T cells that allow long-lasting immunity to occur.|$|E
50|$|One type of {{pluripotent}} cell, {{called a}} hematopoietic stem cell, can differentiate {{into a large}} variety of cells with different functions. This stem cell can produce red blood cells, platelets, mast cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils. Each of these cells has a different function, but they all work together {{as part of the}} immune system. Monocytes can differentiate into either dendritic cells or macrophages. Macrophages are covered with chemical receptors and phagocytose foreign particles, but are specific about what immune responses to be involved in. Dendritic cells phagocytose invaders; then they present the antigen on their surface to stimulate the <b>acquired</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> (lymphocytes) as backup.|$|E
40|$|Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) {{bind the}} {{constant}} Fc region of IgG molecules. IgG/antigen-containing immune complexes elicit {{a variety of}} effector functions in cells that express activating FcγRs. Because activating FcγRs are present on cells from the innate <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> such as dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes, these IgG receptors form a crucial link between the innate and the <b>acquired</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems.</b> Recently, the ability to detect the inhibitory FcγRIIb on cells has indicated an imbalance between activating and inhibitory FcγRs in rheumatoid arthritis. This progress offers an opportunity to study modulation of FcγR balance and could stimulate development of FcγR-directed immunotherapy.

5000|$|The {{nervous and}} <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> have many {{interactions}} that dictate overall body health.

40|$|It is {{believed}} that tumor development, outgrowth and metastasis are under the surveillance of the <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> Although both innate and <b>acquired</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> play roles, innate immunity is the spearhead against tumors. Recent studies have revealed the critical role of natural killer (NK) cells in immune surveillance and that NK cell activity is considerably influenced by various agents, such as environmental factors, stress, foods and drugs. Some of these NK cell stimulants {{have been used in}} complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) since ancient times. Therefore, the value of CAM should be re-evaluated from this point of view. In this review, we overview the intimate correlation between NK cell functions and CAM agents, and discuss possible underlying mechanisms mediating this. In particular, neuro-immune crosstalk and receptors for CAM agents are the most important and interesting candidates for such mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Allograft {{rejection}} {{results from}} a complex process involving both the innate and <b>acquired</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems.</b> The innate <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> predominates in the early phase of the allogeneic response, during which chemokines and cell adhesion play essential roles, not only for leukocyte migration into the graft but also for facilitating dendritic and T-cell trafficking between lymph nodes and the transplant. This results in a specific and acquired alloimmune response mediated by T cells. Subsequently, T cells and cells from innate <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> function synergistically to reject the allograft through nonexclusive pathways, including contact-dependent T cell cytotoxicity, granulocyte activation by either Th 1 or Th 2 derived cytokines, NK cell activation, alloantibody production, and complement activation. Blockade of individual pathways generally does not prevent allograft rejection, and long-term allograft survival is achieved only after simultaneous blockade of several of them. In this review, we explore each of these pathways and discuss the experimental evidence highlighting their roles in allograft rejection. Journal ArticleReviewinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

5000|$|Antigenic {{variation}} {{refers to}} the mechanism by which an infectious agent such as a protozoan, bacterium or virus alters its surface proteins in order to evade a host immune response. It is related to phase variation. Immune evasion is particularly important for organisms that target long-lived hosts, repeatedly infect a single host and are easily transmittable. Antigenic variation not only enables immune evasion by the pathogen, but also allows the microbes to cause re-infection, as their antigens are no longer recognized by the host's immune system. When an organism is exposed to a particular antigen (i.e. a protein {{on the surface of}} a bacterium) an immune response is stimulated and antibodies are generated to target that specific antigen. The immune system will then [...] "remember" [...] that particular antigen, and defenses aimed at that antigen become part of the immune system’s acquired immune response. If the same pathogen tries to re-infect the same host the antibodies will act rapidly to target the pathogen for destruction. However, if the pathogen can alter its surface antigens, it can evade the host's <b>acquired</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> This will allow the pathogen to re-infect the host while the immune system generates new antibodies to target the newly identified antigen. Antigenic variation can occur by altering a variety of surface molecules including proteins and carbohydrates. There are many molecular mechanisms behind antigenic variation, including gene conversion, site-specific DNA inversions, hypermutation, as well as recombination of sequence cassettes. [...] In all cases, antigenic variation and phase variation result in a heterogenic phenotype of a clonal population. Individual cells either express the phase-variable protein(s) or express one of multiple antigenic forms of the protein. This form of regulation has been identified mainly, but not exclusively, {{for a wide variety of}} surface structures in pathogens and is implicated as a virulence strategy.|$|E
