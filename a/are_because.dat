Calmer, he wants to wait for help, but no one knows where they <b>are</b> <b>because</b> they had told their {{families}} they were going somewhere else. They winch the vehicle back up to the road, but they cannot get it to start.|$|E
5|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this method}} {{is that it can}} be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol <b>are.</b> <b>Because</b> of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies {{are more likely to be}} considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area and in other parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E
5|$|Back at Kiamo Ko, Elphaba {{has already}} {{captured}} Dorothy, refusing to release {{her until she}} relinquishes Nessarose's slippers – the only things left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's castle to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy go. Elphaba refuses until she suddenly receives a letter saying that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other for all grievances, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the Grimmerie to Glinda. The two friends embrace {{for the last time}} before saying goodbye forever, and acknowledge that they are who they <b>are</b> <b>because</b> of each other ("For Good"). As the mob arrives at the castle, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, who appears to melt away. Grief-stricken, Glinda sees that all that remains of her friend is her black hat and the small bottle of green elixir which she had slept with under her pillow.|$|E

5|$|Miyazaki's biggest {{addition}} to {{the plot of the}} book was the use of the war as {{a large part of the}} plot. In the book, the war is only tangentially referred to; the king orders Howl to find the king's missing brother Justin, because Justin's military skills are needed for a forthcoming war. Howl's frequent disappearances <b>are</b> <b>because</b> of his womanizing habits, which makes Sophie see him as a superficial and cowardly person. In the film, however, Howl disappears from the scene in order to transform into a giant bird and disrupt the battle plans of both armies.|$|E

25|$|The street {{children}} and children {{running away from}} home are connected. A child running away from home ends {{on the street in}} most situations. There is lot of data available on why children run away, revealing many reasons for doing so. Some reasons are simple, some complex. Some time the reasons <b>are</b> <b>because</b> of the child's behavior, and some times the causes <b>are</b> <b>because</b> of parents. A child not going to school or not doing home work and thus fearing beatings, is a very common cause. A child stealing money, fighting with siblings are reasons too.|$|E

Standard unicycles don't have a chain, which limits the seat height based on how long the rider's legs <b>are,</b> <b>because</b> there the crank is attached directly to the wheel axle. Giraffe unicycles can range in heights from 3 feet to over 10 feet high.|$|E

25|$|The best-known death myth is the Chasa Bonpuli myth. The hero Gangrim Doryeong {{is ordered}} to capture Yeomra, King of the Underworld, by his king (Kimchiwonnim) {{in order to}} {{discover}} {{the reason for the}} mysterious deaths of the three sons of Gwayanggaxi. With help from Munshin, the door god, and Jowangshin, the kitchen god, Gangrim Doryeong captures Yeomra. After testing Gangrim Doryeong's wisdom, Yeomra tells Kimchiwonnim that the mysterious deaths <b>are</b> <b>because</b> the three sons are actually the three princes of Beomul, who were murdered by Gwayanggaxi. They chose to be reborn as Gwayanggaxi's sons to take revenge on their killers. Gangrim Doryeong became the death god, who reaps dead souls and brings them to the underworld.|$|E
25|$|Male M. drewseni only spend 4.8 days in {{the nest}} after they emerge and {{spend the rest of}} their lives outside of the nest. Once they leave the nest, males tend to {{circulate}} where specific females <b>are</b> <b>because</b> of feeding and foraging opportunities. On their circuits, males seek out nectar from flowers and also seek out mates. Observations have shown that if a male sees a female nearby, he will alter his flight path and pounce on the female to attempt copulation. In most cases, the female is able to shake off the male and fly away. If two males come in contact with the same female, they will usually attack each other and the male that first found the female will try to bite the second male.|$|E
25|$|Six {{isolated}} {{permanent teeth}} were found. They consisted of an upper lateral incisor, upper third premolar, upper fourth premolar, upper first molar, and an upper second molar, {{as well as}} 121 cranial fragments. All of the teeth found had complete crowns with developed roots. The varying size of the roots in each tooth {{make it difficult to}} determine if they are damaged, or the length they <b>are</b> <b>because</b> of development. It was determined that all of the pieces belonged to a 9-12-year-old juvenile. The sex of this particular fossil remains unknown. The teeth found have Neanderthal features, as some of them show Taurodontism, which is primarily found in the Neanderthal morphology. Studies of the pieces of cranium found are more ambiguous and harder to link to Neanderthals. The Parietal bone has a stronger likeness to anatomically modern humans, while other bones of the skull can be linked to Neanderthal craniums. Most researchers believe that this particular fossil is a Neanderthal because of the analysis of its dentition.|$|E

25|$|Pigments appear {{the colors}} they <b>are</b> <b>because</b> they {{selectively}} reflect and absorb certain wavelengths of visible light. White light is a roughly equal {{mixture of the}} entire spectrum of visible light with a wavelength in a range from about 375 or 400 nanometers to about 760 or 780nm. When this light encounters a pigment, parts of the spectrum are absorbed by the molecules or ions of the pigment. In organic pigments such as diazo or phthalocyanine compounds the light is absorbed by the conjugated systems of double bonds in the molecule. Some of the inorganic pigments such as vermilion (mercury sulfide) or cadmium yellow (cadmium sulfide) absorb light by transferring an electron from the negative ion (S2−) to the positive ion (Hg2+ or Cd2+). Such compounds are designated as charge-transfer complexes, with broad absorption bands that subtract most of {{the colors of the}} incident white light. The other wavelengths or parts of the spectrum are reflected or scattered. The new reflected light spectrum creates the appearance of a color. Pigments, unlike fluorescent or phosphorescent substances, can only subtract wavelengths from the source light, never add new ones.|$|E

Alton then recalls about a funny guy in Korea who got his brains blown out over the Pacific and that [...] "there's nothing funny about that". Jerry (frightened) eventually goes to the bathroom, abandoning George (also frightened), who attempts to compliment Alton about his book, Fair Game. George gets uncomfortable and tells Alton {{he has to make}} a phone call. He meets Jerry in the bathroom and both mention how terrified they <b>are</b> <b>because</b> of Alton; they decide to go home if Elaine does not show up in the next ten minutes.

500|$|During {{the early}} stages of her career, Perry's musical style gravitated towards gospel and she aspired to be as {{successful}} as Amy Grant. At the age of 15, she heard Queen's [...] "Killer Queen," [...] which inspired her to pursue a career in music. She cites the band's frontman, Freddie Mercury, as her biggest influence and expressed how the [...] "combination of his sarcastic approach to writing lyrics and his 'I don't give a fuck' attitude" [...] inspired her music. She paid homage to the band by naming her third fragrance Killer Queen. Perry described The Beach Boys and their album Pet Sounds as having a considerable influence on her music: [...] "Pet Sounds {{is one of my favorite}} records and it influenced pretty much all of my songwriting.
