40|$|Many {{organizations}} have invested substantial resources {{in recent years}} to implement a balanced scorecard of performance metrics. From a historical focus exclusively on financial metrics of performance, the emphasis has shifted recently to a consideration of a portfolio of non-financial performance metrics related to customers, business process and technology. In this paper, we investigate the best practice frontier relationship between a financial performance metric (return on assets - ROA) and three nonfinancial performance metrics (number of <b>access</b> <b>lines</b> per employee, percentage of digital <b>access</b> <b>lines</b> and percentage of business <b>access</b> <b>lines)</b> reported and used in the U. S. telecommunications industry. Analyzing detailed data from over fifty local exchange carriers for a period of five years (from 1993 to 1997), we find that managers must tradeoff contemporaneous ROA when increasing the percentage of business <b>access</b> <b>lines.</b> We also find that managers do not have to trade off ROA with the other two nonfinancial performance metrics because these metrics are contemporaneously congruent...|$|R
