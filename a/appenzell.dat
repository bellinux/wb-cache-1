5|$|By the mid 20th century, in some European countries, {{women still}} lacked some {{significant}} rights. Feminists {{in these countries}} continued to fight for voting rights. In Switzerland, women gained {{the right to vote}} in federal elections in 1971; but in the canton of <b>Appenzell</b> Innerrhoden women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland. In Liechtenstein, women were given the right to vote by the women's suffrage referendum of 1984. Three prior referendums held in 1968, 1971 and 1973 had failed to secure women's right to vote.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland was {{the last}} Western {{republic}} to grant women the right to vote. Some Swiss cantons approved this in 1959, while {{at the federal level}} it was achieved in 1971 and, after resistance, in the last canton <b>Appenzell</b> Innerrhoden (one of only two remaining Landsgemeinde) in 1990. After obtaining suffrage at the federal level, women quickly rose in political significance, with the first woman on the seven member Federal Council executive being Elisabeth Kopp, who served from 1984–1989, and the first female president being Ruth Dreifuss in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{country was}} {{historically}} about evenly balanced between Catholic and Protestant, with a complex patchwork of majorities {{over most of}} the country. Geneva converted to Protestantism in 1536, just before John Calvin arrived there. It became known internationally as the Protestant Rome, being base for such reformers as Theodore Beza or William Farel. Zürich became another stronghold around the same time, with Huldrych Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger, later joined by fleeing Peter Martyr Vermigli, taking the lead there. One canton, <b>Appenzell,</b> was officially divided into Catholic and Protestant sections in 1597. The larger cities and their cantons (Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, Zürich and Basel) used to be predominantly Protestant. Central Switzerland, the Valais, the Ticino, <b>Appenzell</b> Innerrhodes, the Jura, and Fribourg are traditionally Catholic. The Swiss Constitution of 1848, under the recent impression of the clashes of Catholic vs. Protestant cantons that culminated in the Sonderbundskrieg, consciously defines a consociational state, allowing the peaceful co-existence of Catholics and Protestants. A 1980 initiative calling for the complete {{separation of church and state}} was rejected by 78.9% of the voters. Some traditionally Protestant cantons and cities nowadays have a slight Catholic majority, not because they were growing in members, quite the contrary, but only because since about 1970 a steadily growing minority became not affiliated with any church or other religious body (21.4% in Switzerland, 2012) especially in traditionally Protestant regions, such as Basel-City (42%), canton of Neuchâtel (38%), canton of Geneva (35%), canton of Vaud (26%), or Zürich city (city: >25%; canton: 23%).|$|E
50|$|The zone system {{approach}} has been adopted by many other fare networks in Switzerland, such as libero (fare network) in cantons of Bern and Solothurn, and OSTWIND (fare network) in Thurgau, St. Gallen, Glarus, both <b>Appenzells</b> (AI and AR), and Fürstentum Liechtenstein.|$|R

50|$|The Appenzeller Bahnen (AB) {{with its}} total of 77 km of mainly metre-gauge tracks just {{recently}} combined (2006) the earlier separate Trogenerbahn from St. Gallen to Trogen, the standard-gauge railway from Rorschach, Switzerland to Heiden, Switzerland, the short {{track of the}} funiculair from Rheineck to Walzenhausen, {{as well as the}} previous Appenzeller Bahnen. The AB connects main spots within both <b>Appenzells</b> with St. Gallen and Altstätten in the Alpine Rhine Valley.|$|R
5|$|On 8 April 1524, five cantons, Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, and Zug, {{formed an}} alliance, die fünf Orte (the Five States) to defend {{themselves}} from Zwingli's Reformation. They contacted the opponents of Martin Luther including John Eck, who had debated Luther in the Leipzig Disputation of 1519. Eck offered to dispute Zwingli and he accepted. However, they could not agree on {{the selection of the}} judging authority, the location of the debate, {{and the use of the}} Swiss Diet as a court. Because of the disagreements, Zwingli decided to boycott the disputation. On 19 May 1526, all the cantons sent delegates to Baden. Although Zurich's representatives were present, they did not participate in the sessions. Eck led the Catholic party while the reformers were represented by Johannes Oecolampadius of Basel, a theologian from Württemberg who had carried on an extensive and friendly correspondence with Zwingli. While the debate proceeded, Zwingli was kept informed of the proceedings and printed pamphlets giving his opinions. It was of little use as the Diet decided against Zwingli. He was to be banned and his writings were no longer to be distributed. Of the thirteen Confederation members, Glarus, Solothurn, Fribourg, and <b>Appenzell</b> as well as the Five States voted against Zwingli. Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and Zurich supported him.|$|E
25|$|The Reformation in Switzerland led to doctrinal {{division}} {{amongst the}} cantons. Zürich, Berne, Basel, Schaffhausen and associates Biel, Mulhouse, Neuchâtel, Geneva {{and the city}} of St. Gallen became Protestant; other members of the confederation and the Valais remained Catholic. In Glarus, <b>Appenzell,</b> in the Grisons and in most condominiums both religions coexisted; <b>Appenzell</b> split in 1597 into a Catholic <b>Appenzell</b> Inner Rhodes and a Protestant <b>Appenzell</b> Outer Rhodes.|$|E
25|$|The two half cantons <b>Appenzell</b> Innerrhoden and <b>Appenzell</b> Ausserrhoden are {{completely}} surrounded by {{lands of the}} canton of St. Gallen.|$|E
50|$|The voters {{can also}} {{vote for the}} {{government}} of each canton. The ballot has only one line where the voter can place the full name of any mature citizen that lives in the said canton, i.e. a write-in candidate. There are no party votes, only candidate votes; so this procedure is called ("Majorzwahl") where the candidate with the most votes wins. However, cantons use a two-round system, during the first ballot only candidates which win an absolute majority are elected. If not all officers are elected during the first round as second round takes place where a simple majority is sufficient to be elected (known as plurality in the US).All Cantons have a single chamber parliament mostly elected by proportional representation. Most of them have several electoral districts of different size and some varieties in the formulas to calculate the seats per party. Graubünden and both <b>Appenzells</b> elect their parliament in majority system.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{settlement}} of the [...] "Cross War" [...] with the also Reformed Imperial City of St. Gallen in 1697, prince-abbot Bürgisser ordered the municipality of Wattwil to start construction of the road over the Ricken Pass on the Toggenburg side through socage. Out of the refusal of the Wattwilers to collaborate to building the road, which they regarded {{as a threat to}} their religious freedom as well as financial suppression, a serious conflict with the prince-abbot arose. The abbot eventually resolved to simply incarcerate the highest Toggenburg magistrate, the Landweibel Josef Germann, to break the opposition. Because Germann was a Catholic, the complaints of the Toggenburgers were heard by the protector cantons, which began acting on behalf of the Toggenburgers. In this situation, Landeshofmeister Fidel von Thurn moved the abbot to seek diplomatic ties within the Holy Roman Empire, concluding a protection treaty with Emperor Leopold I of Habsburg in 1702, and even receiving the investiture as Imperial Prince in 1706. These events threatened to raise the conflict to a European level. Moreover, this constituted a grave breach of the structure and sovereignty of the Confederacy: the Imperial Abbey of St Gall seemed to entirely escape the influence of the Confederacy (of which it was a member since 1451) and enter into the Austrian sphere of influence (while the Swiss had fought for centuries to uphold their independence from the Habsburgers). Especially both <b>Appenzells,</b> but also Zürich, could not accept such a turn of affairs. Besides that, the Princely Lands housed the fourth greatest population within the Confederacy, and was also of essential economic importance to Eastern Switzerland.|$|R
25|$|Nidwalden and Obwalden form {{traditional}} subdivisions of Unterwalden. Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landschaft, {{as well as}} <b>Appenzell</b> Inner- and Ausserrhoden, {{are half}} cantons, resulting from the division of Basel and <b>Appenzell,</b> respectively.|$|E
25|$|In 1402/3 Schwyz {{signed an}} {{alliance}} with <b>Appenzell,</b> which was seeking independence from the Abbey of St. Gall. In May 1403, the Abbot and the Habsburgs sent a force to defeat the rebellious Appenzellers while Schwyz and Glarus sent troops to defend their ally. On 15 May 1403, the Abbot's forces entered the pass leading to Speicher, and outside the village of Vögelinsegg they met the <b>Appenzell</b> army. A detachment of about 80 Appenzellers started the attack from a hill over the valley, with about 300 soldiers from Schwyz and 200 from Glarus moving around the flanks of the army. When the League's cavalry charged up the hill, they met 2000 Appenzellers and were forced to retreat. During the retreat, about 600 horsemen {{and many of the}} 5000 infantry were killed by the <b>Appenzell</b> army. The League signed a peace treaty with <b>Appenzell</b> at Arbon, but the peace was short-lived. <b>Appenzell</b> formed an anti-Habsburg alliance, the Bund ob dem See, with several cities including Bregenz. In 1408 the Habsburgs besieged Bregenz, and the Bund, including Schwyz, marched out to support Bregenz. However, when they met the Habsburgs, the Bund was decisively defeated and the Bund collapsed. Schwyz paid the Habsburgs off to avoid an attack and <b>Appenzell</b> retained some independence but eventually became an associate of the Confederation.|$|E
25|$|Both the City and the Abbey were {{associates}} (Zugewandte Orte) of the Old Swiss Confederacy, {{but unlike}} <b>Appenzell</b> never joined as full members.|$|E
25|$|The Bishop of Basel, Jakob Christoph Blarer von Wartensee, {{moved his}} seat to Porrentruy in the Jura {{mountains}} in 1529, when Basel became Protestant. In 1581, the bishopric regained the Birs valley lying southwest of Basel. In <b>Appenzell,</b> where both confessions coexisted {{more or less}} peacefully, the counter-reformatory activities beginning {{with the arrival of}} the Capuchin friars resulted in a split of the canton in 1597 into the Catholic <b>Appenzell</b> Innerrhoden and the Protestant Ausserrhoden, which both had one vote in the Tagsatzung.|$|E
25|$|The city of St. Gallen became {{independent}} of the Abbey in 1405. At the same time, the Abbey {{lost control of the}} <b>Appenzell.</b> Conversely, the Toggenburg was acquired by the Abbey in 1468.|$|E
25|$|The territories at Lake Zürich, Walensee and Rheintal {{remained}} independent until 1798. In the Helvetic Republic, {{the northern}} {{parts of the}} modern canton together with <b>Appenzell</b> became the Canton of Säntis, while its southern parts together with Glarus became the canton of Linth.|$|E
25|$|Within modern-day {{representative}} governments, certain electoral tools like referendums, citizens' {{initiatives and}} recall elections {{are referred to}} as forms of direct democracy. Direct democracy as a government system currently exists in the Swiss cantons of <b>Appenzell</b> Innerrhoden and Glarus, and kurdish cantons of Rojava.|$|E
25|$|After the Forest Cantons uprising, some cantons were merged, thus {{reducing}} their anti-centralist effectiveness in the legislature. Uri, Schwyz, Zug and Unterwalden together became the canton of Waldstätten; Glarus and the Sarganserland became the canton of Linth, and <b>Appenzell</b> and St. Gallen combined as the canton of Säntis.|$|E
25|$|At this time, {{the eight}} cantons {{gradually}} increased {{their influence on}} neighbouring cities and regions through additional alliances. Individual cantons concluded pacts with Fribourg, <b>Appenzell,</b> Schaffhausen, the abbot {{and the city of}} St. Gallen, Biel, Rottweil, Mulhouse and others. These allies (known as the Zugewandte Orte) became closely associated with the confederacy, but were not accepted as full members.|$|E
25|$|Switzerland was {{the last}} Western {{republic}} to grant women's suffrage; they gained {{the right to vote}} in federal elections in 1971 after a second referendum that year. In 1991 following a decision by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland, <b>Appenzell</b> Innerrhoden became the last Swiss canton to grant women the vote on local issues.|$|E
25|$|However, in 1451 {{the abbey}} became {{an ally of}} Zürich, Lucerne, Schwyz and Glarus who were {{all members of the}} Confederation. In early 1490 the four cantons {{supported}} the Abbot against the rebellious city and the <b>Appenzell.</b> Following their victory the Confederation took ownership of the city of St. Gallen and rejected the inroads of the empire.|$|E
25|$|In 1468 the abbot, Ulrich Rösch, {{bought the}} County of Toggenburg from {{the representatives of}} its counts, after the family died out in 1436. In 1487 he built a monastery at Rorschach on Lake Constance, to which he planned to move. However, he {{encountered}} stiff resistance from the St.Gallen citizenry, other clerics, and the <b>Appenzell</b> nobility in the Rhine Valley who were concerned about their holdings. The town of St.Gallen wanted to restrict the increase {{of power in the}} abbey and simultaneously increase the power of the town. The mayor of St. Gallen, Ulrich Varnbüler, established contact with farmers and <b>Appenzell</b> residents (led by the fanatical Hermann Schwendiner) who were seeking an opportunity to weaken the abbot. Initially, he protested to the abbot and the representatives of the four sponsoring Confederate cantons (Zürich, Lucerne, Schwyz, and Glarus) against the construction of the new abbey in Rorschach. Then on July 28, 1489 he had armed troops from St.Gallen and <b>Appenzell</b> destroy the buildings already under construction. When the abbot complained to the Confederates about the damages and demanded full compensation, Varnbüler responded with a counter suit and in cooperation with Schwendiner rejected the arbitration efforts of the non-partisan Confederates. He motivated the clerics from Wil to Rorschach to discard their loyalty to the abbey and spoke against the abbey at the town meeting at Waldkirch, where the popular league was formed. He was confident that the four sponsoring cantons would not intervene with force, due to the prevailing tensions between the Confederation and the Swabian League. He was strengthened in his resolve {{by the fact that the}} people of St.Gallen elected him again to the highest magistrate in 1490.|$|E
25|$|The Burgundy Wars {{prompted}} a further {{enlargement of the}} confederacy; Fribourg and Solothurn were accepted in 1481. In the Swabian War against Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, the Swiss were victorious and exempted from imperial legislation. The associated cities of Basel and Schaffhausen joined the confederacy {{as a result of}} that conflict, and <b>Appenzell</b> followed suit in 1513 as the thirteenth member. The federation of thirteen cantons (Dreizehn Orte) constituted the Old Swiss Confederacy until its demise in 1798.|$|E
25|$|Hammered dulcimers, {{and other}} similar instruments, are {{traditionally}} played in Iraq, India, Iran, Southwest Asia, China, and parts of Southeast Asia, Central Europe (Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Czech Republic, Switzerland (particularly <b>Appenzell),</b> Austria and Bavaria), the Balkans, Eastern Europe (Ukraine and Belarus) and Scandinavia. The instrument is also played in the United Kingdom (Wales, East Anglia, Northumbria) and the U.S., where its traditional use in folk music saw a notable revival in the late 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Although {{conservative}} in many ways, Germany nevertheless differs from other German-speaking regions in Europe, being much more progressive on women's {{right to be}} politically involved, compared to neighbouring Switzerland (where women obtained {{the right to vote}} in 1971 at federal level, and at local canton level in 1990 in the canton of <b>Appenzell</b> Innerrhoden) and Liechtenstein in 1984. In Germany, there are also strong regional differences; for instance Southern Germany (particularly Bavaria) is more conservative than other parts of Germany; while former East Germany is more supporting of women's professional life than former West Germany.|$|E
25|$|Late adopters in Europe were Spain in 1933, France in 1944, Italy in 1946, Greece in 1952, San Marino in 1959, Monaco in 1962, Andorra in 1970, Switzerland in 1971 at federal level, and {{at local}} canton level between 1959 in the cantons of Vaud and Neuchâtel and 1991 in the canton of <b>Appenzell</b> Innerrhoden, and Liechtenstein in 1984. In addition, {{although}} women in Portugal obtained suffrage in 1931, this was with stronger restrictions {{than those of}} men; full gender equality in voting was only granted in 1976.|$|E
25|$|The Reformation in Switzerland {{began in}} 1523, led by Huldrych Zwingli, priest of the Great Minster church in Zürich since 1518. Zürich adopted the Protestant religion, joined by Berne, Basel, and Schaffhausen, while Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Nidwalden, Zug, Fribourg and Solothurn {{remained}} Catholic. Glarus and <b>Appenzell</b> were split. This led to multiple inter-cantonal religious wars (Kappeler Kriege) in 1529 and 1531, because each canton usually made the opposing religion illegal, {{and to the}} formation of two diets, the Protestant one meeting in Aarau and the Catholic one in Lucerne (as well as the formal full diet still meeting usually in Baden) but the Confederation survived.|$|E
25|$|Because Switzerland is {{a federal}} state with three {{different}} levels – the Confederation, the 26 cantons and their local communes – non-citizen voting rights vary greatly depending on the individual entity. Foreigners may not cast ballots on the national level, {{but they may be}} entitled to vote and, in some cases, to run for office on the cantonal or communal level. Five cantons have already recognized the right of foreigners to vote (Neuchâtel, Jura, Vaud in 2003, Fribourg in 2004, Geneva in 2005), plus three, <b>Appenzell</b> Ausserrhoden (1995), Graubünden (2003) and Basel-Stadt (2005) which accord to each municipality the authority to decide on the subject. Some referendums unsuccessfully took place in other cantons.|$|E
25|$|Political power congealed {{around the}} 13 cantons (Bern, Zürich, Zug, Glarus, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Fribourg, Solothurn, Basel, Luzern, Schaffhausen, <b>Appenzell)</b> {{of the old}} confederation. During this era, the patrician {{families}} decreased in number but increased in power. Some patrician families were drawn from leadership in the guilds or trading groups within the town, while other families grew from successful mercenary captains and soldiers. The trend toward increasing authoritarianism conflicted {{with the history of}} public expression that grew out of the Swiss Reformation. In many regions the patrician families were unable to suppress the public assemblies, but they did dominate the assemblies. The tradition of inviting the people to express their opinions died out mostly during this era.|$|E
25|$|In Switzerland, {{conflicts}} {{between humans and}} wolves reached a peak in the 16th century, amid large-scale deforestations. Wolves became extinct in Zürich in 1684. They were later exterminated from <b>Appenzell</b> Ausserrhoden in 1695, and Schaffhausen in 1712. The last known traces of wolves in central Switzerland date back to 1707 in Zug, 1753 in Uri and 1793 in Glarus. Wolves became extinct in Engadin in 1821. Between 1762 and 1842, 80 wolves were recorded to have been bountied in Vaud. Wolves were further exterminated in Valais in 1870, Ticino in 1872 and Solothurn in 1874. Wolves occasionally migrated to Switzerland in small numbers in the early 20th century. In 1908, a wolf was shot in Ticino, and a further two were killed in 1914 in Lignerolle.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} few years, the cities of St. Gallen, Schaffhausen, Basel, Bienne, Mulhouse, and finally Bern (in 1528) all {{followed}} the example set by Zürich. Their subject territories were converted to Protestantism by decree. In Basel, reformer Johannes Oecolampadius was active, in St. Gallen, the Reformation was adopted by mayor Joachim Vadian. In Glarus, <b>Appenzell,</b> and in the Grisons, which all three had a more republican structure, individual communes decided for or against the Reformation. In the French-speaking parts, reformers like William Farel had been preaching the new faith under Bernese protection since the 1520s, but only in 1536, just before John Calvin arrived there, did the city of Geneva convert to Protestantism. The same year, Bern conquered the hitherto Savoyard Vaud and also instituted Protestantism there.|$|E
25|$|In {{the north}} and northwest, the Swiss Plateau is sharply delimited {{geographically}} and geologically by the Jura Mountains. In the south, {{there is no clear}} border with the Alps. Usually, the rising of the terrain to altitudes above 1500 metres AMSL (lime Alps, partly sub-alpine molasse), which is very abrupt in certain places, is taken as a criterion for delimitation. Occasionally the regions of the higher Swiss Plateau, especially the hills of the canton of Fribourg, the Napf region, the Töss region and parts of the <b>Appenzell</b> region are considered to form the Swiss Alpine foreland in a narrow sense. However, if a division into the three main regions Jura Mountains, Swiss Plateau and Alps is considered, the Alpine foreland belongs clearly to the Swiss Plateau. In the southwest, the Swiss Plateau is confined by Lake Geneva, in the northeast, by Lake Constance and the Rhine.|$|E
500|$|SBC {{continued}} {{to grow in the}} early decades of the 20th century, acquiring weaker rivals. [...] In 1906, SBC purchased Banque d'Espine, Fatio & Cie, establishing a branch in Geneva, Switzerland, for the first time. [...] Two years later, in 1908, the bank acquired Fratelli Pasquali, a bank in Chiasso, Switzerland, its first representation in the Italian-speaking portion of the country. [...] This was followed by the 1909 acquisition of Bank für <b>Appenzell</b> (est. 1866) and the 1912 acquisition of Banque d'Escompte et de Dépots.|$|E
500|$|The cantons have a {{permanent}} constitutional status and, {{in comparison with the}} situation in other countries, a high degree of independence. Under the Federal Constitution, all 26 cantons are equal in status. Each canton has its own constitution, and its own parliament, government and courts. However, there are considerable differences between the individual cantons, most particularly in terms of population and geographical area. Their populations vary between 15,000 (<b>Appenzell</b> Innerrhoden) and 1,253,500 (Zürich), and their area between [...] (Basel-Stadt) and [...] (Graubünden). The cantons comprise a total of 2,485 municipalities. Within Switzerland there are two enclaves: Büsingen belongs to Germany, Campione d'Italia belongs to Italy.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 14th and early 15th centuries, the farmers of the abbot's {{personal}} estates (known as <b>Appenzell,</b> from [...] meaning [...] "cell (i.e. estate) of the abbot") began seeking independence. In 1401, {{the first of}} the <b>Appenzell</b> Wars broke out, and following the <b>Appenzell</b> victory at Stoss in 1405 they became allies of the Swiss Confederation in 1411. During the <b>Appenzell</b> Wars, the town of St.Gallen often sided with <b>Appenzell</b> against the abbey. So when <b>Appenzell</b> allied with the Swiss, the town of St.Gallen followed just a few months later. The abbot became an ally of several members of the Swiss Confederation (Zürich, Lucerne, Schwyz and Glarus) in 1451. While <b>Appenzell</b> and St.Gallen became full members of the Swiss Confederation in 1454. Then, in 1457 the town of St.Gallen became officially free from the abbot.|$|E
