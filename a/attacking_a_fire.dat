50|$|In {{front of}} the museum is the Fallen Firefighter Memorial. It {{includes}} a memorial wall {{with the names of}} every known Los Angeles firefighter who has died while on active duty. The memorial also includes a series of life-size bronze statues depicting five firefighters. Two of the firefighters are depicted <b>attacking</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire,</b> while a fallen firefighter is attended to by a fourth figure. The fifth figure is the fire captain, shown making a command decision and also caring for the downed firefighter. The statues was based on a concept and designed by Los Angeles Fire Captain Harold Dwayne Golden and created in Minnesota by Honors for Excellence.|$|E
30|$|Prioritization {{of these}} efforts {{will depend on the}} goals and {{objectives}} of the responsible stakeholder groups. If the goal is to improve the environmental impact from first responders and the fire service then number one (1) should be undertaken to understand more fully the environmental impacts that the fire service contributes when <b>attacking</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> and what possible changes they can make to reduce their environmental impact. Similarly fire protection designers can make a number of choices that affect the environmental impact of a building when considering if a fire does occur. There are numerous tools that exist to calculate the environmental footprint of a building and similar techniques could be used to account for the effects of fire. Number two (2) would involve exploring ways to incorporate the comparable sustainability between different types of fire protection measures. This could help answer questions as to what extent should sprinklers be implemented versus structural fire protection. The decision tool for policy makers described in number three (3) could be developed to understand the fire problem from a holistic viewpoint including the use of fire protection (preventive) and fire intervention (attack). To accomplish this an agreed way to calculate the aggregate effects of the fire would need to be established. A large concern with doing this currently is the lack of equivalent data from country to country. Another concern {{that needs to be addressed}} is which impacts are considered important and how to rank impacts that effect different parts of the environment, for different periods of time. If these can be resolved it is recommended that we determine an aggregate data set for comparison to other sources of environmental impacts as well as to get an accurate picture of the problem. Then ways to better incorporate prevention and intervention techniques could be implemented from a policy point of view. The regulation that is being written to save homes and buildings from wildfires by implementing WUI policies in one example of possible outcomes of this level of study like was included in updates to NFPA 1141 and NFPA 1144.|$|E
50|$|Ken is {{informed}} {{that a group}} of flying Carriers are <b>attacking</b> <b>a</b> Jumbo jet full of uninfected evacuees, apparently trying to spread the infection overseas, using level 2 explosive fly carriers to bust a hole into it. While fighting the Level 5 carrier leading the <b>attack,</b> <b>a</b> <b>Fire</b> Hydra, Ken is met with his father again who questions if he's ready for the threats he faces.|$|R

5000|$|A Mattydale lay, {{also called}} [...] "cross-lay", [...] "speedlay", and [...] "transverse lay", {{is a method}} of storing hose on <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> engine. This method of storing hose is {{designed}} for rapid deployment of a hose line to <b>attack</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire.</b> In this manner, the hose is stored perpendicularly across the fire apparatus, usually above or adjacent to the pump panel, {{instead of the usual}} parallel storage in the rear. This allows the firefighter to pull the hose {{in the direction of the}} fire instead of having to make a turn.|$|R

50|$|The {{incident}} {{began when}} the ATF attempted to raid the ranch. An intense gun battle erupted, resulting {{in the deaths of}} four government agents and six Branch Davidians. Upon the ATF's failure to raid the compound, a siege was initiated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the standoff lasting 51 days. Eventually, the FBI launched an assault and initiated <b>a</b> tear gas <b>attack</b> in <b>an</b> attempt to force the Branch Davidians out of the ranch. During the <b>attack,</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> engulfed Mount Carmel Center. In total, 76 people died, including David Koresh.|$|R
5000|$|Tower castles {{were used}} for lookouts and to send warnings. If a castle was under <b>attack,</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> would be built {{on top of the}} castle, which could be seen for about fifty miles around, or to the next tower castle. The ruins of these castles, spaced about fifty miles apart can thus be seen {{periodically}} as one travels throughout the country. David Sweetman wrote [...] "The great age of Irish castle-building began {{with the arrival of the}} Anglo-Normans, traditionally dated to 1169, and continued right up to the seventeenth century." ...|$|R

5000|$|On May 1, 2008, Danton Burroughs died of <b>a</b> heart <b>attack</b> {{following}} <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> in {{the family}} home in Tarzana, which destroyed a room containing memorabilia of his father John Coleman Burroughs and grandfather Edgar Rice Burroughs. The cause of the fire is unknown.|$|R
50|$|Yousef then {{returned}} to Manila, where he began preparing {{at least a dozen}} bombs, each with more explosive materials. Weeks before his planned <b>attacks,</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> started in his Manila flat, forcing him to flee the room, leaving everything behind. The fire made the apartment staff suspicious, and soon police, led by Aida Fariscal, raided the flat and uncovered the plot. A Philippine National Police raid in another Manila apartment revealed related evidence that Abdul Murad, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and Yousef had drawn up plans for flying an airplane into the CIA headquarters. The information was passed on to the Federal Aviation Administration, who warned individual airlines.|$|R
50|$|In <b>a</b> hasty <b>attack</b> often <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> {{support team}} will be {{positioned}} {{in such a way}} that allows it to oversee the battlefield to control the indirect fire. Any organic fire support, like mortar sections, will establish firing positions and prepare to suppress the enemy position.|$|R
5000|$|How quickly {{a company}} is {{able to get back}} to {{business}} after <b>a</b> terrorist <b>attack,</b> <b>a</b> tornado, <b>a</b> <b>fire,</b> or <b>a</b> flood often depends on emergency planning and preparation done before the disaster strikes. The Ready Campaign highlights three steps to Business Disaster Preparedness: 1) Plan to Stay in Business; 2) Talk to Your People; and 3) Protect Your Investment. [...] These steps underscore how important it is for businesses to document their property/equipment, back up business-critical information, and put a response team in place.|$|R

50|$|Act Two shows a Wednesday matinée {{performance}} {{one month}} later, at the (fictional) Theatre Royal in Ashton-under-Lyne. In this act, {{the play is}} seen from backstage, providing a view that emphasises the deteriorating relationships between the cast. Romantic rivalries, lovers' tiffs and personal quarrels lead to offstage shenanigans, onstage bedlam and the occasional <b>attack</b> with <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> axe.|$|R
50|$|With the coldcut Cobra cutting {{extinguisher}} <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> fighter can <b>attack</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> {{from the}} safety of being outside the fire room. The water jet combined with an abrasive cutting sand makes it possible to 'shot' right through a wall or other structure. When the water jet has penetrated the fine water droplets in the water jet hits the hot fire gases in the fire room and are turned to steam. This sucks the energy out of the fire and quickly reduces the temperature in the fire room {{to the point where the}} risk of a back-draft is very much reduced or eliminated. It is then safer to make entry into the fire room and apply conventional fire fighting tactics if required. As very little water is used in the process there is also much less water damage to take care of compared with conventional fire fighting methods.|$|R
50|$|All this {{movement}} and agitation confused the Chileans, who couldn't decipher {{what was going}} on in the Allied army. Therefore, when Salvo saw an incoming scout mission sent earlier by Suárez, he thought it was <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> and <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> warning shot upon them. Some units from Cáceres and Suárez divisions rushed to aid their companions, believing that this was the battle signal; and assaulted Salvo’s position in disarray. Despite the officers efforts, the battle started.|$|R
50|$|One ship later {{developed}} was the Jho Sho Maru, a barque-rigged steamer, {{built in}} the 1860s for the Japanese Navy. This vessel carried a belt of iron armour plating at the waterline together with eight 64 pounder and two 100 pounder guns. James suffered <b>a</b> fatal heart <b>attack</b> when <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> {{broke out in the}} yard during the ship's construction.|$|R

50|$|On 11 April, the {{squadron}} flew a patrol of two aircraft. During the patrol, Lt. Baer <b>attacked</b> <b>a</b> German biplane, <b>firing</b> 50 rounds. The enemy aircraft {{spun out of}} control and was lost in the clouds near Bouvancourt.|$|R
5000|$|New to Breath of Fire IV is the Combo System, {{which allows}} certain spells or {{skills to be}} cast in a {{specific}} order to gain bonus damage or other effects. [...] Casting two ice spells in sequence, for example, will produce <b>a</b> stronger ice <b>attack,</b> while <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> spell followed by a wind spell will create <b>an</b> explosion-based <b>attack.</b> Combos may also automatically occur in single attacks that {{have more than one}} effect.|$|R
5000|$|During the 2012 Benghazi <b>attack,</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> was {{set against}} the main {{consulate}} building with three Americans inside—Stevens, Sean Smith, and a security officer. According to U.S. officials, the security officer escaped and the staff found Smith dead. However, the staff were unable to locate Stevens before being driven from the building under small-arms fire. [...] Local civilians found Stevens and {{brought him to the}} Benghazi Medical Centre in a state of cardiac arrest. Medical personnel tried to resuscitate him, but he was pronounced dead at about 2 a.m. local time on September 12, 2012. Later reports suggested that the attack was coordinated and planned in advance, with any protests either coincidental or possibly diversionary. [...] Libyan president Muhammad Magariaf blamed elements of Ansar al-Sharia for the killing, linking them to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Libyan officials suggested that it might have been <b>a</b> revenge <b>attack</b> mounted by loyalists (of deceased Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi) who were defeated in the Libyan Civil War the previous year.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, the Prussian XI Corps {{had become}} {{involved}} in an engagement. The left of the V Corps' outposts had overnight occupied Gunstett and {{the bank of the}} Sauer, and the French, shortly after daylight on 6 August 1870, sent down an unarmed party to fetch water. As this appeared through the mist, the Prussians naturally fired upon it, and the French General Lartigue (to whose division the party belonged), puzzled to account for the firing, brought up some batteries in readiness to repel <b>an</b> <b>attack.</b> These <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> few rounds only, but remained in position as a precaution.|$|R
500|$|Passengers applauded as Schuringa {{walked back}} to his seat. The suspect was {{isolated}} from other passengers until after the plane landed. A flight attendant asked Abdulmutallab {{what he had in}} his pocket, and the suspect replied: [...] "Explosive device." [...] When the <b>attack</b> triggered <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> indicator light within the cockpit, the pilot requested rescue and law enforcement. The plane made an emergency landing at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport in the Downriver Detroit community of Romulus, Michigan, just before 13:00 local time.|$|R
50|$|On January 29, 2017, {{the mosque}} {{was the target}} of <b>an</b> <b>attack.</b> <b>A</b> gunman opened <b>fire</b> on the crowd, killing six people in the mosque and {{injuring}} nineteen others. The attack was denounced by the politicians throughout Quebec and Canada and attracted a wave of sympathy all over the world.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was then}} playfully <b>attacked</b> with <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> {{extinguisher}} by Freddie Starr. The closing credits {{were followed by}} a brief comic skit of Edmonds' 1970s childrens show Multi-Coloured Swap Shop, in which a seemingly young Noel wakes from a dream in the Swap Shop studio - recounting the events to Keith Chegwin and John Craven of a typical House Party episode (reminiscent of the infamous Bobby Ewing [...] "shower scene" [...] in Dallas) suggesting that the entire run of House Party never really happened.|$|R
2500|$|During the British <b>attack,</b> <b>a</b> Bedouin <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> {{bullet that}} {{shattered}} Lance corporal McGregor's ankle. On 19 February the Royal Flying Corps flew McGregor {{out with his}} leg in a box splint, with him sitting in the observer's seat of a Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c, a two-seater biplane. The flight to El Arish took 45 minutes. The alternative to aeromedical evacuation was a cacolet (a type of litter) on a camel, which one historian described as [...] "a form of travel exquisite in its agony for wounded men {{because of the nature}} of the animal's movement". Travel by cacolet would have taken days.|$|R
50|$|Lanyon Homestead was {{threatened}} by the 2003 Canberra bushfires, which also threatened the nearby township of Tharwa. On January 18, 2003, as fires were approaching Canberra, the homestead was hosting <b>a</b> wedding. The <b>fire</b> situation deteriorated, prompting the evacuation of Tharwa, which was defended and saved by Southern Rural Fire Brigades. The Lanyon Homestead was not impacted by fire, though it did come under ember <b>attack.</b> <b>A</b> single <b>fire</b> truck was on hand to hose down and protect the historic homestead. Given the age of Lanyon, this was certainly {{not the first time}} the property had faced bushfires.|$|R
