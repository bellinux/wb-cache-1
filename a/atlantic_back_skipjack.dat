Here, we present proxy records of temperature and salinity from aragonite sclerosponge skeletons, extending existing records of the Salinity Maximum Waters (SMW) of the N. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>back</b> to 1890. These proxy records show secular temperature increases of 1. 6 - 2. 0 °C, higher than published global averages, and salinity increases of 0. 35 - 0. 5 psu, smaller than short-term secular trends recently measured. Salinity reconstructions vary more significantly on the decadal scale, showing changes {{that are related to}} low-frequency variations of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). On both secular and decadal time scales, the records indicate significant thermohaline changes in the SMW, either via forcing at the surface or increasing depths of density surfaces in the Bahamas...|$|R

40|$|The {{security}} {{dynamics in}} Asia Pacific Region {{are concerned with}} the interaction of the countries within the region. The interaction between China and the United States is became a recent interesting phenomenon linked to China’s rapid economic and military development. That conditions {{will have an impact on}} the balance of power within the region. The United States as a hegemonic force in recent decades saw the development of China’s military power as a catalyst for the instability of the region, seeing that the US re-oriented the defense policy orientation from the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>back</b> to the Pacific. The existence of two countries in an effort to seize dominance in the Pacific will have an impact on the security of the region. Therefore this paper will attempt to discuss the security dynamic of the Asia Pacific region on the rivalry of two super power, US and China. The discussion will be started by analyzing the relationship between the dominance of the inter-regional interaction in the region and make a description of US domination as a major power in Asia Pacific which was rivaled by China through the development of maritime power and will look at US defense policy in response to the development of China’s maritime power in Pacific region, where the rivalry of these two forces is predicted to escalated in conflict in the South China Sea...|$|R
40|$|Total and soluble trace metal {{concentrations}} were determined in atmospheric aerosol and rainwater samples collected during seven cruises in the south-east <b>Atlantic.</b> <b>Back</b> trajectories indicated the samples all represented remote marine air masses, consistent with climatological expectations.

Median total Fe, Al, Mn, V, Co and Zn {{concentrations were}} 206, 346, 5, 3, 0. 7 and 11 pmol m- 3 respectively. Solubility was operationally defined as the fraction extractable using a pH 4. 7 ammonium acetate leach. Median soluble Fe, Al, Mn, V, Co, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd and Pb concentrations were 6, 55, 1, 0. 7, 0. 06, 24, 2, 1, 0. 05 and 0. 3 pmol m- 3 respectively. Large ranges in fractional solubility were observed for all elements except Co; median solubility values for Fe, Al and Mn were below 20 % while the median for Zn was 74 %. Volume weighted mean rainwater concentrations were 704, 792, 32, 10, 3, 686, 25, 0. 02, 0. 3 and 10 nmol L- 1 for Fe, Al, Mn, V, Co, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd and Pb respectively (n = 6).

40|$|Aquaculture {{management}} authorities {{require the}} ability to identify the farm of origin for escaped fish. Physical tagging is routinely conducted for domesticated animals (e. g. sheep and cattle); however, there are considerable logistical, animal welfare and economic issues that challenge the feasibility of physically tagging all farmed fish. A ‘DNA stand-by method’ for identification of escaped <b>Atlantic</b> salmon, <b>back</b> to the cage and farm of origin, was established at the Institute of Marine Research in Norway. In addition, proof-of-concept for the method has been demonstrated {{to be able to}} trace rainbow trout and <b>Atlantic</b> cod escapees <b>back</b> to their farm source. The combined sampling, genotyping and statistical analysis on which the method is based has been implemented successfully in the identification of fish farm escapees in Norway, resulting in fines for companies found in breach of regulations. This paper reviews the method, its challenges, and some previously considered alternatives. It is concluded that as the method has been successful for the 3 major species farmed in Norway, each with contrasting production logistics including breeding programs, state of domestication, and magnitude of production, the DNA stand-by method can be applicable to identification of fish farm escapees {{for a wide range of}} aquaculture species in all regions of the world...|$|R

50|$|At the club, {{the main}} topic of {{conversation}} is the recent theft of £55,000 from the Bank of England which was discussed till the bank's governor Mr. Sullivan arrives and requests a change of topic. Sullivan's off-hand remark that the thief is still in London causes the elderly Lord Guinness to bring up {{an article in the}} Morning Chronicle, detailing how it is now possible to travel around the world in eighty days. The article states that one departs London by train for Dover, where one crosses to Calais, and on to Paris. From there, it is a train journey to Brindisi, and the Suez Canal, all within a week. Having rounded the Arabian peninsula, one would arrive in Bombay on day 20 and then a three-day railway journey to Calcutta. Hong Kong is reached on day 33, Yokohama on day 39, and then a mammoth three-week crossing of the Pacific to arrive in San Francisco on day 61, a week-long train crossing to New York City and then finally a nine-day crossing of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>back</b> to London making it possible to circumnavigate the globe in eighty days. The other members of the club laugh at Lord Guinness's suggestion that he would take on the challenge if he were younger, prompting Fog to defend his honor by taking up the task himself. Sullivan bets Fog £5,000 that it is impossible, and additional wagers by three other club members increase this amount to £20,000. He then stuns the club by announcing that he will leave that very evening and promises to return to the club by 8:45 pm on 21 December 1872.|$|R
