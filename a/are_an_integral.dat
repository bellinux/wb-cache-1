5|$|In {{many animals}} {{of the deep}} sea, {{including}} several squid species, bacterial bioluminescence is used for camouflage by counterillumination, in which the animal matches the overhead environmental light as seen from below. In these animals, photoreceptors control the illumination to match {{the brightness of the}} background. These light organs are usually separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent bacteria. However, in one species, Euprymna scolopes, the bacteria <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> component of the animal's light organ.|$|E

Traditional dances are highly choreographed and {{separate}} {{men and women}} or forbid participation by one sex altogether. The goals of dances range from pure entertainment to religious devotion. Traditionally, music is transmitted orally. In a typical performance, a chorus of singers echoes a soloist.|$|E
5|$|Gay {{characters}} became common {{enough that}} Diana Wynne Jones' The Tough Guide To Fantasyland contains an entry on gay mages as a fantasy cliché. Such characters {{are found in}} Mercedes Lackey's works, such as the Lambda award-winning The Last Herald Mage trilogy (1989), in which the protagonists are gay and have magical powers. Their relationships <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> part of the story, which takes places in the fictional country of Valdemar.

Coffee and tea {{are the major}} cash crops for export. Tourism is a fast-growing sector {{and is now the}} country's leading foreign exchange earner. Rwanda is one of only two countries in which mountain gorillas can be visited safely, and visitors pay for gorilla tracking permits.

5|$|The Ghats in Varanasi are world-renowned {{embankments}} made in {{steps of}} stone slabs along the river bank where pilgrims perform ritual ablutions. The ghats <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> complement to the Hindu concept of divinity represented in physical, metaphysical, and supernatural elements. Varanasi has at least 84 ghats, {{most of which are}} used for bathing by pilgrims and spiritually significant Hindu puja ceremony, while a few are used exclusively as Hindu cremation sites. Steps in the ghats lead to the banks of Ganges, including the Dashashwamedh Ghat, the Manikarnika Ghat, the Panchganga Ghat, and the Harishchandra Ghat, where Hindus cremate their dead. Many ghats are associated with Hindu legends and several are now privately owned.|$|E
5|$|In July 1996, Firaxis {{began work}} on Alpha Centauri, with Reynolds heading the project. Meier and Reynolds wrote playable {{prototype}} code and Jason Coleman wrote the first lines of the development libraries. Because the development of Gettysburg took up most of Firaxis' time, the designers spent the first year prototyping the basic ideas. By late 1996, the developers were playing games on the prototype, and {{by the middle of}} the next year, they were working on a multiplayer engine. Although Firaxis intended to include multiplayer support in its games, an important goal was to create games with depth and longevity in single-player mode because they believed that the majority of players spend most of their time playing this way. Reynolds felt that smart computer opponents <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> part of a classic computer game, and considered it a challenge to make them so. Reynolds' previous games omitted internet support because he believed that complex turn-based games with many player options and opportunities for player input are difficult to facilitate online.|$|E

5|$|Currently McMaster has twelve smoke-free student residences: Bates, Brandon, Edwards, Hedden, Les Prince, Mary E. Keyes, Matthews, McKay, Moulton, Wallingford, Whidden, and Woodstock Hall. McMaster's student residences can {{accommodate}} 3,685 students. The latest residence {{to be built}} was Les Prince Hall, a large co-ed building, completed in 2006. It was named for a long-time hall master in the residence system who lived with his family on campus until after his retirement in 1980. In September 2010, 49 percent of first-year students lived on campus, with 17.1 percent of the overall undergraduate population living on campus. Residences provide traditional room and board style, furnished apartment style, and suite-style accommodation. Brandon Hall houses the university's substance-free lifestyle living spaces. The residence system is supervised by Residence Life staff, who provide guidance and help the transition to university life for many first-year students. Residence students are represented by the Inter-Residence Council (IRC), which aims to build {{a sense of community}} among the residents through programming. Additionally, the IRC seeks to advocate for residence students on issues they may face, such as facilities, dining, environment, and more, and provide opportunities for residence students to gain valuable leadership opportunities. They <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> part of the McMaster residence community.|$|E
