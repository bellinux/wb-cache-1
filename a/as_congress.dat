5|$|After the Congress of Vienna, a small Kingdom of Poland, known <b>as</b> <b>Congress</b> Poland, was recreated, {{with its}} king being the Tsar of Russia, Alexander I. Alexander I, an enlightened autocrat, {{decided to use}} Congress Poland as an {{experiment}} to see if Russian autocratic rule could be mixed with an elective legislative system, and rule Poland as a constitutional monarchy. At that time many hoped that this experiment would be a success and pave way to a liberalization in Russia; {{in the end it}} proved to be a failure.|$|E
5|$|Article One {{came within}} one {{state of the}} number needed to become adopted into the Constitution on two {{occasions}} between 1789 and 1803. Despite coming close to ratification early on, it has never received the approval of enough states {{to become part of}} the Constitution. <b>As</b> <b>Congress</b> did not attach a ratification time limit to the article, it is still technically pending before the states. Since no state has approved it since 1792, ratification by an additional 27 states would now be necessary for the article to be adopted.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, Taft ruled for a {{unanimous}} court in Balzac v. Porto Rico. One of the Insular Cases, Balzac involved a Puerto Rico newspaper publisher who was prosecuted for libel but denied a jury trial, a Sixth Amendment {{protection under the}} constitution. Taft held that as Puerto Rico was not a territory designated for statehood, only such constitutional protections <b>as</b> <b>Congress</b> decreed would apply to its residents.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{initially}} left {{to devise a}} Reconstruction policy without legislative intervention, <b>as</b> <b>Congress</b> was not due to meet again until December 1865. Radical Republicans told the President that the Southern states were economically {{in a state of}} chaos and urged him to use his leverage to insist on rights for freedmen as a condition of restoration to the Union. But Johnson, with the support of other officials including Seward, insisted that the franchise was a state, not a federal matter. The Cabinet was divided on the issue.|$|E
5|$|Partitions of Poland {{at the end}} of the 18th century {{brought an}} end to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna {{established}} a semi-independent Kingdom of Poland (known <b>as</b> <b>Congress</b> Kingdom) under control of and in personal union with the Russian Empire. The King (Tsar) of Poland at that time used a white royal banner emblazoned with the arms of the Congress Kingdoma black double-headed Russian eagle with the Polish White Eagle in an inescutcheon.|$|E
50|$|From {{this time}} forward, {{as the nation}} grew and Congress dealt with new public policy {{concerns}} and created new committees, the Energy and Commerce Committee has maintained its central position <b>as</b> <b>Congress's</b> monitor of commercial progressâ€”a focus reflected in its changing jurisdiction, both in name and practice.|$|R

5|$|Although the {{compromise}} passed the Senate in March 1970, it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who {{was determined to}} end silver in the coinage. The Senate passed the bill again in September, this time attaching it as a rider to a bank holding company bill sought by Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half dollar and to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was approved by a conference committee and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that <b>as</b> <b>Congress</b> had adjourned, not signing the bill would pocket veto it, Nixon hastily signed it just before midnight on December 31, 1970, only minutes before the deadline.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{returned}} to active politics again in 1936, with the Nehru presidency and the Lucknow {{session of the}} Congress. Although Gandhi wanted a total focus {{on the task of}} winning independence and not speculation about India's future, he did not restrain the Congress from adopting socialism as its goal. Gandhi had a clash with Subhas Chandra Bose, who had been elected president in 1938, and who had previously expressed a lack of faith in nonviolence as a means of protest. Despite Gandhi's opposition, Bose won a second term <b>as</b> <b>Congress</b> President, against Gandhi's nominee, Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya; but left the Congress when the All-India leaders resigned en masse in protest of his abandonment of the principles introduced by Gandhi. Gandhi declared that Sitaramayya's defeat was his defeat.|$|E
5|$|Historian Keith W. Olson {{has written}} that Nixon left a {{negative}} legacy: fundamental mistrust of government with its roots in Vietnam and Watergate. During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998, both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage: Republicans suggested that Clinton's misconduct had been comparable to Nixon's, while Democrats contended that Nixon's actions had been far more serious {{than those of the}} incumbent. Another legacy, for a time, was a decrease {{in the power of the}} presidency <b>as</b> <b>Congress</b> passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate. Olson suggests that grants of power to George W. Bush in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks restored the president's power.|$|E

5|$|Interest in {{attracting}} the capital grew as people realized the commercial benefits and prestige {{that were at}} stake. New York City and Philadelphia each built houses for the president. State officials in New York offered to cede Kingston, while Maryland officials offered to cede either Annapolis or Baltimore. Also, as had {{been the case in}} earlier debates during the 1780s, regional biases, state pride and local loyalties were potent forces and figured into the contest. There was much maneuvering by northern and southern factions in favor of certain sites, and by interstate coalitions that were formed and dissolved almost daily, <b>as</b> <b>Congress</b> debated the matter during the spring of 1790. More than 20 sites were proposed publicly as candidates for the capital city.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} reasons put forth {{as to why}} Dickinson and the Pennsylvania Council did not act. The Council's {{official}} reasoning {{was that they were}} unsure that the local militiamen would actually protect Congress from their fellow soldiers. Further, the council may have thought that the conflict was not as serious <b>as</b> <b>Congress</b> believed and that the mutiny could be resolved peacefully. The second theory put forth is that Dickinson, having been an officer in the militia, was sympathetic to the soldiers' grievances. The third theory is that the Council refused to allow Pennsylvania, a sovereign state, to be subjugated by the demands of a few members of Congress.|$|E

25|$|During the Indian President election, {{there was}} divided opinion between {{the leaders of}} Indian National Congress. Though the party {{nominated}} Dr.Sanjiva Reddy as the Official Candidate, the then Prime Minister, Mrs.Indira Gandhi had suddenly switched her allegiance to Dr.V.V.Giri, the Opposition-sponsored Candidate. She had also advised all party elected members to vote according to their conscience. Dr.V.V.Giri was elected as the President of India {{with the support of}} Mrs.Indira Gandhi. This has resulted in the split of Congress Party and in October 1969. Senior Leaders like Morarji Desai, Athulya Ghosh, Kamarajar, S K Patil and Nijalingappa on the one side <b>as</b> <b>Congress</b> (Organisation) and Indira Gandhi, Shankar Dayal Sharma, Jagjivan Ram, C Subramaniam on the Other Side <b>as</b> <b>Congress</b> (Indira). The DMK, led by Mr.Karunanidhi took a stance to support Mrs.Indira Gandhi in certain reforms like abolition of privy purse, nationalisation of Banks.|$|E

5000|$|Although the nondelegation {{doctrine}} prevents Congress from delegating its {{legislative authority}} to the executive branch, Congress has allowed the executive to act <b>as</b> <b>Congress's</b> [...] "agent" [...] in trade negotiations, such as by setting tariffs, and, {{in the case of}} Trade Promotion Authority, by solely authoring the implementing legislation for trade agreements. The constitutionality of this delegation was upheld by the Supreme Court in Field v. Clark (1892).|$|R
