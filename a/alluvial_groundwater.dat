Overuse of nitrogen fertilizers and irrigated agriculture is common, and according to Thomas Harter, the Chair for Water Resources Management and Policy at UC Davis, “more than 80 pounds of nitrogen per acre per year may leach into groundwater beneath irrigated lands, usually as nitrates”.

Hierarchical cluster analyses and principal component analysis were applied to time-series data to evaluate the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater during periods of extreme drought and severe flooding. A simple three-dimensional geological model was developed to conceptualise the catchment morphology and the stratigraphic framework of the alluvium.

40|$|The study {{focuses on}} the {{adjacent}} Tenthill and Ma Ma catchments which converge onto the heavily cultivated alluvial plain of Lockyer Creek. Groundwater extracted from the alluvial aquifers is {{the primary source of}} water for intensive irrigation. Within the study the hydrogeology is investigated, a conceptual groundwater model produced and a numerical groundwater flow model is developed from this. The hydrochemistry and stable isotope character of groundwater are also investigated to determine processes such as recharge and evaporation. Examination of bore logs confirms the Quaternary alluvium comprises a laterally continuous gravel aquifer with an average thickness of 4. 5 m, overlain by mixed sands and clays which form a semi-confining layer with an average thickness of 22 m. Variations in long term groundwater hydrographs indicate the aquifer changes from confined to unconfined in some locations as water levels drop, while bores adjacent to creek banks display a rapid response to a flood event. Pump testing of bores screened in the gravel produces estimates of hydraulic conductivity ranging from 50 - 80 m/day and storativity of 0. 00166 which are both within realistic bounds for this aquifer material. Major ion chemistry of surface water collected during a flood is Mgdominated, similar to <b>alluvial</b> <b>groundwater</b> in the Tenthill catchment and the Lockyer plain, suggesting a strong connection between surface and groundwater in these locations. <b>Alluvial</b> <b>groundwater</b> salinity in Tenthill catchment is typically less than 3500 ìS/cm but may approach 6000 ìS/cm on the Lockyer plain. By contrast Ma Ma catchment <b>alluvial</b> <b>groundwater</b> is Na-dominated with conductivity up to 12000 ìS/cm and more associated with groundwater from the underlying sandstone bedrock. Stable isotope analyses of <b>alluvial</b> <b>groundwater</b> from throughout both catchments and the Lockyer plain are compared with basalt and sandstone groundwater. A range of processes have been identified including recharge to alluvium from basalt groundwater and evaporated surface water; and alluvial-bedrock groundwater mixing at some locations. Integration of the components of the study enabled the production of a conceptual hydrogeological model of the Lockyer alluvial plain, proposing two hydrostratigraphic units; the gravel aquifer and the overlying mixed sand and clay which acts as a semi confining unit. Hydrochemical and stable isotopic evidence suggests seepage from creek channels as the dominant recharge process. A single layer groundwater flow model using MODFLOW was developed, based on groundwater extraction data, to represent flow in the gravel aquifer. The model was calibrated to transient conditions with groundwater fluctuations, incorporating both drought and flood conditions. A sensitivity analysis for each of the aquifer properties demonstrates the model is insensitive to variations within realistic bounds for the gravel aquifer material, however, the model is highly sensitive to changes in the chosen boundary conditions.

30|$|In general, in {{hard rock}} terrain, water quality {{variations}} and changes are common, especially for fluoride in shallow, intermediate and deep aquifers. In <b>alluvial</b> plain <b>groundwater,</b> however, such variation {{and changes in}} fluoride levels are usually rare. Similar observations were noted in Ganges alluvial plain, fluoride contamination has been reported by Indian state and central groundwater departments in a few districts like Unnao, Kanpur, and Agra (Misra et al. 2006). The sources of geogenic (apatite, biotite, and clays) and anthropogenic(chemical fertilizers), {{with a combination of}} higher rate of evaporation and longer interaction of water with the aquifer materials under alkaline environment, are the key factors for the concentration of F− in the study area (SubbaRao 2009). High concentrations of fluoride in groundwater were noted in granite and granitoid gneiss (Kim et al. 2006). Low concentration of F− is observed in northwestern part of the study area as subsurface lithology has very low hydrologic conductivity and the clays present in the highly weathered rock mass might have resulted in the removal of F− by OH molecules through the process of ion exchange (Misra 2005; Singaraja et al. 2012; Manikandan et al. 2012). Moreover, the weathering of alkaline sedimentary rocks (especially Shales) may also result in removal of F− into soil from the groundwater (McNelly et al. 1979).

Groundwater chemistry, isotope data (H 20 -δ 2 H and δ 18 O, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, 3 H and 14 C) and groundwater level time-series data from approximately 550 observation wells were integrated into the catchment-wide 3 D model to assess the recharge processes involved. This approach enabled the identification of zones where recharge to the alluvium primarily occurs from stream water during episodic flood events. Importantly, the study also demonstrates that in some sections of the alluvium recharge is also from storm rainfall and seepage discharge from the underlying GAB aquifers.

The groundwater samples were highly saline (up to 6300 mM chlorine), anoxic, and contained methane. A mass balance calculation demonstrates that the very low d 13 CDIC in this groundwater is due to anaerobic methane oxidation. Sulfate depletion coincident with isotope enrichment of sulfur and oxygen isotopes in the sulfate suggests that sulfate reduction is associated with this AOM.

Pressure on a water reticulation pipeline due for repair or replacement, combined with an increasing population) {{formed the basis for}} this investigation. It was hoped that local groundwater resources could at least supplement the domestic supply coming from Lyttelton. Drill hole and geophysical information confirmed that the sediments that fill the lower Purau and Orton Bradley Valleys consist of river clays and silts, marine/estuarine muds and a number of gravel units. In the case of the Purau Valley two aquifers were located, a first probably representing an infilled river channel or channels immediately overlying volcanic bedrock (Lower Purau Aquifer), and a second river gravel unit which is saturated only within 200 m of the coast (Upper Purau Aquifer). While no borehold data was available to confirm geophysical data interpretations for the Orton Bradley Valley, the indications are that a single river gravel unit exists, and that it is saturated near the coast. Pump test results for the Lower Purau Aquifer show that this aquifer has a transmissivity of 11. 92 m 2 /day and a storage coefficient of 3. 87 x 10 - 4. Computer modelling indicated the Lower Purau Aquifer possesses two hydraulic boundaries 14 and 50 m from the pumped bore I and {{this is consistent with the}} interpretation of the aquifer being an infilled river channel of approximately 64 m width. Evidence suggests that the alluvial aquifers of both valleys are recharged from deep circulating groundwaters present in fractured bedrock aquifers located within the volcanic formations found in the area. Isotope and chemical evidence suggests that the alluvial and deep circulating groundwaters are similar in their relative concentrations of most ions, and have similar residence times of about 50 years. The deep and <b>alluvial</b> <b>groundwaters</b> are fit for domestic supply provided treatment is carried out for excessive concentrations of iron and manganese, and aeration to bring low pH values to within acceptable limits. An experiment on a known perennial High Altitude Spring indicates that the increased discharge seen following a rain event is composed almost entirely of 'old' stored water, and the increased flow is due to increa. sed pressure head following recharge of the aquifer system by meteoric waters. Superimposed on this event variability is a seasonal discharge variability related to seasonal rainfall patterns. An infiltration- 'head' /storage model is proposed to explain the behaviour of the High Altitude Springs of Diamond Harbour. Isotopic evidence suggests an exponential-piston flow model is consistent with observed results and this indicates the spring groundwaters have residence times of 10 to 25 years.

We address these issues based on the continuous monitoring of groundwater discharge, river discharge (one year), and aquifer storage (6 months) in the 6 km 2 alluvial system of a 194 km 2 catchment.

We applied atmospheric corrections to TIR images and calibrated them based on in situ data. To characterize spatial and temporal thermal patterns, three temporal approaches were applied. A single survey of each site was performed to comparatively explore the nine braided reaches. Three reaches were imaged twice, in 2010 and 2011, to explore inter-annual variability. Finally, two reaches were selected for an intra-day survey for which four and three flights, respectively, were realized within one day. We reported two types of thermal patterns in braided reaches, the first showing very low thermal variability throughout the day. This low variability was linked to the low diversity found in the aquatic habitat, notably due to proglacial regimes with high summer flows which homogenize water temperatures. The second type exhibited a higher thermal variability with changes during the day. The temperature of flowing channels changed during the daytime according to air temperature. In contrast, the temperature of channels downstream connected to the main network exhibited smaller changes, which created thermal variability over space and time associated with hyporheic or phreatic flows. Non-proglacial and proglacial reaches behaved differently according to air temperature. Proglacial reaches were colder and less sensitive to air temperature in comparison with non-proglacial reaches. These findings allow for a prediction of habitat diversity from temperature heterogeneity based on time and the proportion of ponds, <b>alluvial,</b> and <b>groundwater</b> channels...|$|R
40|$|Indus deltaic plain {{consists}} of medium to fine grained sediments, rich in organic matter deposited during the Holocene period. Thar desert {{is covered with}} sand dunes and loess originated from transported sediments from Rann of Kutch or the Indus plain by monsoon winds or by the reworking of local <b>alluvial</b> deposits. <b>Groundwater</b> salinity and microbial pollution are common in both types of lanforms, but arsenic (AS) and fluoride (F) toxicity dominate in the groundwater of Indus delta and Thar desert, respectively. Arsenic concentration in Tando Mohammad Khan and Tando Allayar varies from 10 - 500 ppb and exhibits near neutral slightly alkaline pH ranging from 6. 8 to 8. 0. Arsenic distribution is patchy {{and seems to be}} related to the prsence of small scale redox zonation in the aquifer. High arsenic affected areas are densely populated and intensively cultivated and its hot spots are those from where the Indus river passed during the Holocene period including Tando Allayar and Tando Mohammad Khan. Extensive ground water irrigation has accelerated flow of groundwater that brought dissolved degraded organic matter in contact with arsenic bearing sediments, enhancing reduction processes and triggering release of arsenic from detrital bioitite and muscovite in the groundwater. Furthermore, unlined sanitation and microbial contamination contribute to degradation of organic matter that enhances the reduction of iron oxy-hydroxide leading to release of arsenic to groundwater. Fluoride is found in all the groundwater samples of Tharparkar district, in the range of 0. 96 - 2. 74 mg/l. The pH of groundwater is alkaline (7. 38 - 8. 59), which is accelerating maximum (1. 24 %) F dissolution in the groundwater. The favourable pH of groundwater and soil composition of Holocene sediments of Indus delta and slightly older alluvium of Thar desert, respectively are responsible for mobilization of arsenic and fluoride in groundwater of Sindh province of Pakistan...|$|R
40|$|For {{strongly}} sorbing contaminants, transport from upland {{areas to}} surface water systems is typically {{considered to be}} due to surface runoff with subsurface transport assumed negligible. However, certain local conditions can lead to an environment where subsurface transport to streams may be significant, a source of contamination not alleviated by current best management practices (e. g. riparian buffers). The Ozark region, including parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Missouri, is characterized by cherty, gravelly soils and gravel bed streams. Previous research identified a preferential flow path (PFP) at a field site along the Barren Fork Creek in northeastern Oklahoma. With the subsoils having hydraulic conductivities on the order of 100 to 500 m/d, the previous research demonstrated that even a sorbing contaminant such as phosphorus can be transported in significant quantities through the subsurface. The objective of the current project was to determine the connectivity of the PFP to the stream and to further evaluate the hypothesis that the <b>alluvial</b> <b>groundwater</b> acts as a transient storage zone, providing a contaminant sink during high flow and a contaminant source during baseflow. A trench was installed above the PFP with the bottom of the trench at the topsoil/alluvial gravel interface. Piezometers were installed along the PFP and throughout the riparian floodplain, which was mapped with electrical resistivity equipment. Water was pumped into the trench to maintain a constant head, and a conservative tracer (Rhodamine WT) was injected into the trench. Water table elevations were recorded real-time using water level loggers and water samples were collected throughout the experiment. Results of the experiment demonstrated preferential movement of Rhodamine WT along the perched preferential flow pathway, infiltration of Rhodamine WT into the <b>alluvial</b> <b>groundwater</b> system, and then transport in the alluvial system as influenced by the stream/aquifer dynamics. This research demonstrated the importance of physical heterogeneity in affecting contaminant transport even in coarse gravel, alluvial subsoils...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{the shallow}} <b>alluvial</b> <b>groundwater</b> of the Hadejia-Jama'are-Yobe River valley flood plain (northern Nigeria) {{has been taking}} place with {{increasing}} intensity over the past decade. However little has previously been known {{about the nature of}} the Yobe River-aquifer interaction, including the recharge mechanisms. This thesis reports on a study of the river-aquifer interaction in the middle section of the basin, centred on a field site near Gashua, Yobe State. Detailed field studies were undertaken over a period of 14 -months, which involved geoelectical sounding, drilling and water level monitoring. The results of the field study show that the Yobe basin is underlain by a sand and gravel aquifer, which is covered by an average of 1 - 3 m of clay. The Yobe River is in hydraulic continuity with the adjacent alluvial aquifer and variations in aquifer storativity have been recognised as an important factor in understanding the hydraulic behaviour of the Yobe River-alluvial groundwater system. A confinedunconfined groundwater regime exists within the present site and is an inherent characteristic of the <b>alluvial</b> <b>groundwater</b> system. The recognition of this state enables a conceptual flow model of the system to be developed. A multi-layer, spatially distributed model is proposed, in which transitions between confined and unconfined conditions can be realistically represented. A numerical model needs to be designed with these concepts in mind in order to simulate the system. The research techniques employed in the study are appropriate for the assessment of the Yobe basin system where detailed data is currently not available. The combination of detailed geophysical survey, water level monitoring and conceptual modelling has led to a good understanding of the Yobe River-alluvial aquifer interaction. It is for this reason that the techniques employed in this study can be adapted for investigating the remainder of the basin downstream of the present site...|$|E
40|$|Production {{of methane}} from thick, {{extensive}} coalbeds in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming has created water management issues. More than 4. 1 {{billion barrels of}} water have been produced with coalbed natural gas (CBNG) since 1997. Infiltration impoundments, which are the principal method used to dispose CBNG water, contribute to the recharge of underlying aquifers. Airborne electromagnetic surveys of an alluvial aquifer that has been receiving CBNG water effluent through infiltration impoundments since 2001 reveal produced water plumes within these aquifers and also provide insight into geomorphologic controls on resultant salinity levels. Geochemical data from the same aquifer reveal that CBNG water enriched in sodium and bicarbonate infiltrates and mixes with sodium-calcium-sulfate type <b>alluvial</b> <b>groundwater,</b> which subsequently may have migrated into the Powder River. The highly sodic produced water undergoes cation exchange reactions with native alluvial sediments as it infiltrates, exchanging sodium from solution for calcium and magnesium on montmorillonite clays. The reaction may ultimately reduce sediment permeability by clay dispersion. Strontium isotope data from CBNG wells discharging water into these impoundments indicate that the Anderson coalbed of the Fort Union Formation is dewatered due to production. Geophysical methods provide a broad-scale tool to monitor CBNG water disposal especially in areas where field based investigations are logistically prohibitive, but geochemical data are needed to reveal subsurface processes undetectable by geophysical techniques. The results of this research show that: (1) CBNG impoundments should not be located near streams because they can alter the surrounding hydraulic potential field forcing saline <b>alluvial</b> <b>groundwater</b> and eventually CBNG water into the stream, (2) point bars are poor impoundment locations because they are essentially in direct hydraulic communication with the associated stream and because plants readily transpire shallow groundwater within them creating vadose zone salt accumulations that will be dissolved by infiltrating CBNG water, and (3) cation exchange reactions in vadose zone sediments may reduce soil permeability beneath infiltration impoundments through clay dispersion lowering their designed disposal capacity...|$|E
40|$|SummaryZona Citrícola is an {{important}} area for Mexico due to its citriculture activity. Situated in a sub-humid to humid climate adjacent to the Sierra Madre Oriental, this valley hosts an aquifer system that represents sequences of shales, marls, conglomerates, and <b>alluvial</b> deposits. <b>Groundwater</b> flows from mountainous recharge areas to the basin-fill deposits and provides base flows to supply drinking water to the adjacent metropolitan area of Monterrey. Recent studies examining the groundwater quality {{of the study area}} urge the mitigation of groundwater pollution. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the physical and chemical properties of the groundwater and to assess the processes controlling the groundwater’s chemistry. Correlation was used to identify associations among various geochemical constituents. Factor analysis was applied to identify the water’s chemical characteristics that were responsible for generating most of the variability within the dataset. Hierarchical cluster analysis was employed in combination with a post-hoc analysis of variance to partition the water samples into hydrochemical water groups: recharge waters (Ca–HCO 3), transition zone waters (Ca–HCO 3 –SO 4 to Ca–SO 4 –HCO 3) and discharge waters (Ca–SO 4). Inverse geochemical models of these groups were developed and constrained using PHREEQC to elucidate the chemical reactions controlling the water’s chemistry between an initial (recharge) and final water. The primary reactions contributing to salinity were the following: (1) water–rock interactions, including the weathering of evaporitic rocks and dedolomitization; (2) dissolution of soil gas carbon dioxide; and (3) input from animal/human wastewater and manure in combination with by denitrification processes. Contributions from silicate weathering to salinity ranged from less important to insignificant. The findings suggest that it may not be cost-effective to regulate manure application to mitigate groundwater pollution...|$|R
40|$|The {{study focused}} on the seepage of uranium from unlined tailing dams into the {{alluvial}} aquifer in the Gawib River floodplain in Namibia where the region solely relies on groundwater for its economic activities {{as a result of}} arid climatic condition. The study reviewed previous works besides water sample collection and analyses for major ions, metals and environmental isotopes in addition to field tests on physico-chemical parameters (pH, Electrical Conductivity, Redox and T). Estimation of seepage velocity (true velocity of groundwater flow) has been conducted {{in order to understand the}} extent of radioactive plume transport. The hydrochemistry, stable isotopes and tritium results show that there is uranium contamination from the unlined uranium tailings in the Gawib shallow aquifer system which suggests high permeability of the <b>alluvial</b> aquifer facilitating <b>groundwater</b> flow in the arid region. The radioactive contaminants could spread into the deeper aquifer system through the major structures such as joints and faults. The contamination plume could also spread downstream into the Swakop River unless serious interventions are employed. There is also a very high risk of the plume to reach the Atlantic Ocean through seasonal flash floods that occurs in the area...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring {{programmes}} {{are required}} {{in order to}} define the extent of natural variability, identify trends as a result of man-made perturbations and clarify the effects of restoration and management programmes. A key factor for understanding the properties of floodplains is the hydrological connectivity between the river and <b>alluvial</b> zone via <b>groundwater</b> exchange and flood events. The nature of floodplain ecosystems is strongly de-pendent on the dynamic intersection and areal extent of flood pulses, which imply local and large-scale distur-bances. This creates the mosaic of successional stages- aquatic to terrestrial- with its characteristic functional properties and high biodiversity. On a larger spatial and temporal scale, monitoring the environmental status of floodplains can be done through wide-range mapping of habitat types using remote sensing or other large-scale monitoring procedures. On a more detailed scale, which is required to define precise management procedures, a complex array of both physiographic and biological indicators will be necessary. Physiographic and biological data must be intercali-brated and analyzed {{in order to understand the}} causal relationships between the main functional properties of floodplain ecosystems (nutrient cycling, production and decomposition, import and export processes between river and floodplain, erosion and sedimentation, e. g. clogging of aquifer, terrestrification processes etc.) as well as the habitat conditions for a characteristic biota...|$|R
