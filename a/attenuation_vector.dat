40|$|An {{expression}} is derived for {{the rate at}} which the diffuse <b>attenuation</b> coefficient for <b>vector</b> irradiance approaches its asymptotic value in a homogeneous medium. The asymptotic approach rate is shown to be a function of boundary conditions at the surface and the asymptotic diffuse attenuation coefficient which is an inherent optical property. The asymptotic approach rate is then used to derive the vertical structure of the vector and scalar irradiances, the vector and scalar diffuse attenuation coefficients, the average cosine of the light field, and the remotely sensed reflectance at the surface, based only on the surface values of the vector and scalar irradiances and the vector and scalar diffuse attenuation coefficients. This theory is inverted and combined with previously derived radiative transfer relations to show that in principle the vertical structure of the absorption, scattering, attenuation, and backscattering coefficients can be derived from the vertical structure of the scalar and vector irradiances and the nadir radiance. An example for the western North Atlantic Ocean is provided. The vertical structure of the light in the sea is important to many disciplines. Sun...|$|R
40|$|Vesicular {{stomatitis}} virus (VSV) {{has been}} extensively studied as a vaccine vector and oncolytic agent. Nevertheless, safety con-cerns have limited its widespread use in humans. The type III lambda interferon (IFN-) family of cytokines shares common signaling pathways with the IFN-/ family and thus evokes similar antiviral activities. However, IFN- signals through a dis-tinct receptor complex that is expressed in a cell type-specific manner, which restricts its activity to epithelial barriers, particu-larly those corresponding to the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. In this study, we determined how IFN- expression from recombinant VSV would influence vector replication, spread, and immunogenicity. We demonstrate that IFN- expression se-verely attenuates VSV in cell culture. In vivo, IFN- limits VSV replication in the mouse lung after intranasal administration and reduces virus spread to other organs. Despite this <b>attenuation,</b> however, the <b>vector</b> retains its capacity to induce protective CD 8 T cell and antibody responses after a single immunization. These findings demonstrate a novel method of viral vector attenua-tion {{that could be used}} in both vaccine and oncolytic virus applications. IMPORTANCE Viruses such as VSV that are used as vaccine vectors can induce protective T cell and antibody responses after a single dose. Ad-ditionally, IFN- is a potent antiviral agent that has certain advantages for clinical use compared to IFN-/, such as fewer pa-tient side effects.

40|$|We derive {{explicit}} reconstruction formulas for the attenuated geodesic X-ray transform over functions and, in {{the case}} of non-vanishing <b>attenuation,</b> <b>vector</b> fields, on a class of simple Riemannian surfaces with boundary. These formulas partly rely on new explicit approaches to construct continuous right-inverses for backprojection operators (and, in turn, holomorphic integrating factors), which were previously unavailable in a systematic form. The reconstruction of functions is presented in two ways, the latter one being motivated by numerical considerations and successfully implemented at the end. Constructing the right-inverses mentioned require that certain Fredholm equations, first appearing in [Pestov-Uhlmann, IMRN 2004], be invertible. Whether this last condition reduces the applicability of the overall approach to a strict subset of simple surfaces remains open at present. Comment: 29 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
3000|$|Propagation of an {{attenuated}} wave is characterised by its {{phase velocity}} (υ) and quality factor of attenuation (Q). In general, the inhomogeneity of an attenuating wave is represented through {{the difference in}} the directions of its propagation vector and <b>attenuation</b> <b>vector.</b> In other words, an angle (γ) between equi-amplitude plane and equi-phase plane of an attenuating plane wave represent its inhomogeneous character. To avoid forbidden directions (Krebes and Le, 1994) for γ, an inhomogeneity of an attenuated wave is defined with the non-dimensional inhomogeneity parameter (δ). The relation (15) relates the angle γ to the parameter δ. Hence, phase velocity (υ), quality factor (Q) and attenuation angle (γ) are the main propagation characteristics of an inhomogeneous wave. These characteristics are the functions of δ and, in anisotropic media, these are the functions of propagation direction [...]...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{vaccines}} {{based on}} recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV) expressing foreign viral proteins are protective in several animal disease models. Although these attenuated viruses are nonpathogenic in nonhuman primates when given by nasal, oral, or intramuscular routes, they are pathogenic in mice when given intranasally, and further <b>vector</b> <b>attenuation</b> {{may be required}} before human trials with VSV-based vectors can begin. Mutations truncating the VSV glycoprotein (G) cytoplasmic domain from 29 to 9 or 1 amino acid (designated CT 9 or CT 1, respectively) were shown previously to attenuate VSV growth in cell culture and pathogenesis in mice. Here we show that VSV recombinants carrying either the CT 1 or CT 9 deletion and expressing the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Env protein are nonpathogenic in mice, even when given by the intranasal route. We then carried out {{a detailed analysis of}} the CD 8 + T-cell responses, including in vivo cytotoxic T-cell activity, induced by these vectors. When given by either the intranasal or intraperitoneal route, the VSV-CT 9 vector expressing HIV Env elicited primary and memory CD 8 + T-cell responses to Env equivalent to those elicited by recombinant wild-type VSV expressing Env. The VSV-CT 1 vector also induced potent CD 8 + T-cell responses after intraperitoneal vaccination, but was less effective when given by the intranasal route. The VSV-CT 1 vector was also substantially less effective than the VSV-CT 9 or wild-type vector at inducing antibody to Env. The VSV-CT 9 vector appears ideal because of its lack of pathogenesis, propagation to high titers in vitro, and stimulation of strong cellular and humoral immune responses...|$|R
40|$|The Brighton Collaboration Viral Vector Vaccines Safety Working Group (V 3 SWG) {{was formed}} to {{evaluate}} the safety of live, recombinant viral vaccines incorporating genes from heterologous viral and other microbial pathogens in their genome (so-called "chimeric virus vaccines"). Many such viral vector vaccines are now at various stages of clinical evaluation. Here, we introduce an attenuated form of recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) as a potential chimeric virus vaccine for HIV- 1, with implications {{for use as a}} vaccine vector for other pathogens. The rVSV/HIV- 1 vaccine vector was attenuated by combining two major genome modifications. These modifications acted synergistically to greatly enhance <b>vector</b> <b>attenuation</b> and the resulting rVSV vector demonstrated safety in sensitive mouse and non-human primate neurovirulence models. This vector expressing HIV- 1 gag protein has completed evaluation in two Phase I clinical trials. In one trial the rVSV/HIV- 1 vector was administered in a homologous two-dose regimen, and in a second trial with pDNA in a heterologous prime boost regimen. No serious adverse events were reported nor was vector detected in blood, urine or saliva post vaccination in either trial. Gag specific immune responses were induced in both trials with highest frequency T cell responses detected in the prime boost regimen. The rVSV/HIV- 1 vector also demonstrated safety in an ongoing Phase I trial in HIV- 1 positive participants. Additionally, clinical trial material has been produced with the rVSV vector expressing HIV- 1 env, and Phase I clinical evaluation will initiate in the beginning of 2016. In this paper, we use a standardized template describing key characteristics of the novel rVSV vaccine vectors, in comparison to wild type VSV. The template facilitates scientific discourse among key stakeholders by increasing transparency and comparability of information. The Brighton Collaboration V 3 SWG template may also be useful as a guide to the evaluation of other recombinant viral vector vaccines.

40|$|The reflection/transmission laws (R/T laws) of plane {{waves at}} a plane {{interface}} between two homogeneous anisotropic viscoelastic (dissipative) halfspaces are discussed. Algorithms {{for determining the}} slowness vectors of reflected/transmitted plane waves from the known slowness vector of the incident wave are proposed. In viscoelastic media, the slowness vectors of plane waves are complex-valued, p = P + iA, where P is the propagation vector, and A the <b>attenuation</b> <b>vector.</b> The proposed algorithms may be applied to bulk plane waves (A = 0), homogeneous plane waves (A 6 = 06, P and A parallel), and inhomogeneous plane waves (A 6 = 06, P and A non-parallel). The manner, in which the slowness vector is specified, {{plays an important role}} in the algorithms. For unrestricted anisotropy and viscoelasticity, the algorithms require an algebraic equation of the sixth degree to be solved in each halfspace. The degree of the algebraic equation decreases to four or two for simpler cases (isotropic media, plane waves in symmetry planes of anisotropic media). The physical consequences of the proposed algorithms are discussed in detail. Ke y wo rd s: viscoelastic anisotropic media, reflection and transmission laws, Snell’s law 1...|$|E
40|$|Anisotropic {{attenuation}} may strongly {{influence the}} energy distribution along the wavefront, which has serious implications for AVO (amplitude-variationwith-offset) analysis and amplitude-preserving migration. Here, we present an asymptotic (far-field) study of 2 D radiation patterns for media with anisotropic velocity and attenuation functions. An important parameter for wave propagation in attenuative media is the angle between the wave and attenuation vectors, {{which is called}} the “inhomogeneity angle. ” Application of saddle-point integration helps us to evaluate the inhomogeneity angle and test the common assumption of “homogeneous ” wave propagation that ignores the misalignment of the wave and attenuation vectors. For transversely isotropic media, the inhomogeneity angle vanishes in the symmetry directions and remains small if the model has weak attenuation and weak velocity and attenuation anisotropy. However, reflection and transmission at medium interfaces can substantially increase the inhomogeneity angle, which {{has an impact on}} both the attenuation coefficients and radiation patterns. Numerical analysis indicates that the <b>attenuation</b> <b>vector</b> deviates from the wave vector in the direction of increasing attenuation. The combined influence of angle-dependent velocity and attenuation results in pronounced distortions of radiation patterns, with the contribution of attenuation anisotropy rapidly increasing as the wave propagates away the source. Our asymptotic solution also helps to establish the relationships between the phase and group parameters when wave propagation cannot be treated as homogeneous. Whereas the phase and group velocities are almost independent of attenuation, the inhomogeneity angle has {{to be taken into account}} in the relationship between the phase and group attenuation coefficients.

3000|$|In {{the present}} study, {{our goal is}} to analyze the {{reflection}} and transmission coefficients of a poroelastic layer sandwiched between two dissimilar poroelastic solids saturated with two immiscible fluids. A plane wave, either [...] P_ 1 or [...] SV, is incident on the plane interface [...] z = 0 [...] with an angular frequency ω and an angle of incidence θ_ 0 with respect to vertical [...] z -axis. This incidence results in four reflected waves generated in the poroelastic medium _ 1. Furthermore, four waves from the upper interface (i.e., [...] z = 0 [...]) and four reflected waves from the lower interface (i.e., [...] z = h [...]) are generated in the poroelastic layer _ 2 and four transmitted waves exist in the poroelastic medium _ 3, [...] as shown in Fig.  1. Hence, as a result of multiple reflections at the boundaries of the layer, eight resulting waves with different directions of propagation and attenuation are developed. The procedure used in the present work to determine the reflection and transmission coefficients of plane waves is illustrated by Brekhovskikh (1960), p. 45. This recursive approach is used by various authors including Carcione (2001), Wang et al. (2013), Lyu et al. (2014), Corredor et al. (2014), Chen et al. (2015, 2017), Sahu et al. (2015), Bai et al. (2015, 2016), Paswan et al. (2016), Feng et al. (2016). All the poroelastic media are dissipative due to the presence of viscosity in pore fluids. Hence, the propagation of plane waves in such a medium is represented by inhomogeneous waves, i.e., with different directions of propagation and attenuation. Thus, the incidence of an inhomogeneous wave at the boundary [...] z = 0 [...] is specified through its propagation direction θ_ 0 and attenuation angle γ_ 0. In the [...] x - z [...] plane, θ_ 0 is the angle that propagation vector P⃗_ 0 of the incident wave makes with the [...] z -axis and γ_ 0 is the angle between propagation vector [...] (P⃗_ 0 [...]) [...] and <b>attenuation</b> <b>vector</b> [...] (A⃗_ 0 [...]).|$|E
