50|$|Starting on November 2, 2010, Roland Hedley began {{interviewing}} President Bush for Fox News. The {{interview was}} {{in anticipation of}} the release of Bush's memoir, Decision Points, which was due to be released on November 9. At that point, the asterisk remained but nearly all of the Roman helmet was gone. All that remained was the crest holder (sans crest) which was so badly battered that it resembled an all-in-one assembly of <b>Allen</b> <b>wrenches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Season 1, Episodes 14&15 Original Airdates 12/08/03 12/15/03Built for Snap-on tools, the [...] "Tool Bike" [...] {{incorporated}} several unfinished and untempered tools {{supplied to}} OCC by Snap-on. The frame was created using solid hex shaped metal bars (inspired by <b>allen</b> <b>wrenches)</b> {{instead of the}} more typical round tubing. The metal bars were hollowed out and bent by [...] "Racing Innovations" [...] resulting in a heavier than normal frame. Following the [...] "allen wrench" [...] theme, Paul Jr. bent sheets of 16 gauge cold rolled steel to create hex shaped exhaust covers. A fake oil tank {{was made in the}} shape of a miniature toolbox (the real oil tank was hidden on the bottom of the frame). The entire bike was sprayed with Snap-on's official red paint. As a hidden detail, an authentic ratchet was modified and used as kickstand.|$|R
5000|$|On {{acoustic}} guitars [...] - [...] {{inside the}} guitar body, accessible through the sound hole, {{or on the}} headstock. Martins use a 3/16" [...] (5 mm) <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench</b> and Gibson uses {{the same as for}} the Gibson electrics above.|$|E

Assembling the kit is quick and easy using a single <b>allen</b> <b>wrench</b> (included in the kit).|$|E
5000|$|Male bit {{drivers are}} {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{referred to as}} [...] "sockets", but are in fact the opposite of a socket, in that bit drivers fit into a {{socket head cap screw}} or pipe plug, rather than fit over a male drive head on a nut or bolt as a socket does. A socket is a [...] "female" [...] recess or opening which receives another object, together as a fitting connection. A socket is not a protruding [...] "male" [...] connection. Common male bit drivers of this type include <b>Allen</b> hex <b>wrenches</b> (in both metric and fractional inch sizes), Torx (T-3 thru T-50) spline wrenches, 4-point (square), and 12-point (triple square) male bit drivers. Other specialized screw heads that are often installed or removed with screwdriver type handles and appropriate type tip have socket varieties that fit the various screw head types and a can be attached to a socket wrench. Conversely, for low torque situations, a [...] "socket spinner" [...] screwdriver handle with a socket wrench type fitting on one end can be attached to many different types of sockets, bit drivers and extensions.|$|R

50|$|The {{manual system}} uses a screw {{that has a}} {{standard}} hex head or square head and is driven using an <b>allen</b> key or <b>wrench.</b> A manual knockout punch can handle holes from 0.5 to 1.25 in. The ratchet system has a custom ratcheting wrench that uses a ball screw to make the process faster and easier. This type of system has a mechanical advantage of approximately 220:1 and can punch holes up to 3 in in diameter in 10 gauge mild steel. A hydraulic system is much bulkier and heavier than the other systems {{but it is the}} easiest to use and can make holes up to 6 in in diameter. It is a two piece system where the dies are attached to the ram which is connected to the hydraulic unit via a flexible hose.|$|R
5000|$|Another type is a locking nut. This nut—usually used in {{conjunction}} with a locking vibrato system such as a Floyd Rose or Kahler—clamps the strings against the nut. This improves tuning stability when using the vibrato bar. A drawback however, is that the locking nut must be loosened using an <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench</b> to tune outside the range of the fine tuners on the bridge (if present).|$|E
5000|$|... "El Duce" [...] was {{mentioned}} in the underground hit Fist Fun by Dr. Know in 1986. He was also {{mentioned in the}} Anthrax song [...] "I'm the Man". There's also a song about him by Kill <b>Allen</b> <b>Wrench</b> called El Duce Will Kick Your Ass. Hoke briefly appears in a backstage segment of the Self Destruct Tour portion of the Nine Inch Nails video compilation Closure.|$|E

5000|$|Though El Duce {{claimed that}} he knew who killed Kurt, {{he did not mention}} a name and offered no {{evidence}} to support his assertion. However, he mentioned speaking to someone called [...] "Allen" [...] (<b>Allen</b> <b>Wrench),</b> before quickly interjecting, [...] "I mean, my friend", then laughing, [...] "I'll let the FBI catch him." [...] Broomfield incidentally captured El Duce's final interview, as he died days later when he was struck by a train {{in the middle of the}} night.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout its history, Moots {{has been}} known for the {{innovative}} bicycle components they design and manufacture. In the 1980s, Eriksen design the company's [...] "Moots Mounts," [...] clamp-on cantilever posts which could be removed or repositioned using only an <b>allen</b> <b>wrench.</b> [...] Another innovation was an early version of what became known as [...] "bar ends" [...] in the 1990s. The product made by Moots clamped inside the brake levers and had large wooden balls at the ends.|$|E
50|$|Most {{electric}} fretted string instruments have individually adjustable bridge saddles, adjustable with a {{screw driver}} or <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench.</b> Acoustic fretted instruments typically have either a floating bridge, {{held in place}} by string tension, or a fixed bridge, such as a pin bridge on an acoustic guitar. A luthier or technician adjusts a floating bridge simply by carefully changing its position until the intonation is correct. Adjusting intonation on a fixed bridge involves carefully shaping the bridge saddle with a file to alter the string's contact point.|$|E
5000|$|Screw-in insert nuts have an {{external}} thread and hex head and are screwed {{in with a}} Flat Blade Screwdriver or an <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench.</b> The screw-in insert nuts come in various sizes and take different screw sizes. For example, a [...] "1/4-20" [...] insert nut will take a 1/4-20 inch bolt. The pre-drilled hole must be as deep as {{the length of the}} insert nut plus any portion of the bolt that may be screwed past the end of the nut in the work piece.|$|E
50|$|The PF-9 uses {{many parts}} {{originally}} designed for Kel-Tec’s P-11 and P-3AT models, {{and is a}} compromise between those pistols. From the P-11, the PF-9 uses a slightly modified barrel, trigger, ejector, and front sight. The P-3AT parts used in the PF-9 include the extractor and various springs. The grip is available {{in a variety of}} colors, while the slide is available in blued, Parkerized, ceramic (Cerakote), and hard chromed finishes. The PF-9 is shipped with an extended magazine floorplate, an <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench</b> for adjusting the rear sight, and an owner's manual.|$|E
50|$|Iron sights {{used for}} hunting guns {{tend to be}} a compromise. They will be adjustable, but only with tools—generally either a small {{screwdriver}} or an <b>allen</b> <b>wrench.</b> They will be compact and heavily built, and designed to lock securely into position. Target sights, on the other hand, are much bulkier and easier to adjust. They generally have large knobs to control horizontal and vertical movement without tools, and often they are designed to be quickly and easily detachable from the gun so they can be stored separately in their own protective case.|$|E
5000|$|The IKEA {{effect has}} been {{described}} as follows: [...] "The price is low for IKEA products largely because they take labor out of the equation. With a Phillips screwdriver, an <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench</b> and rubber mallet, IKEA customers can very literally build an entire home's worth of furniture on a very tight budget. But what happens when they do?" [...] They [...] "fall in love with their IKEA creations. Even when there are parts missing and the items are incorrectly built, customers in the IKEA study still loved the fruits of their labors." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{flexible}} {{tongue and}} tendon guard allow players to fully flex {{to get a}} full, natural range of motion. While flexible, the tongue is still stiff enough to prevent lace bite which is a common problem among skaters. The tongue is also removable, so if it ever wears out, a player can replace it. Another feature is that the tendon guard can also be detached with an <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench,</b> so if they break, a player can replace them {{rather than having to}} send the whole boot to get repaired or having to buy an entirely new skate.|$|E
5000|$|The Babicz Continually Adjustable Neck is used {{to adjust}} {{the action of the}} guitar from a low {{electric}} feel all the way to high slide, without changing the tuning or intonation of the guitar and can be done anytime without detuning. This is because unlike previous neck adjustments there is no tilting or pivoting. The neck slides in a pocket parallel to the slides of the guitar not altering scale length or string tension. This is done by inserting a 3/16" [...] <b>allen</b> <b>wrench</b> into the trap plate {{on the back of the}} guitar and turning it in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction.|$|E
5000|$|Ayotte is {{especially}} {{well known for}} their resurrection and improvement of wooden drum hoops, developed as an aesthetic & acoustically pleasing alternative option in place of diecast zinc or flanged steel hoops, although Ayotte also still offers steel hoops. The company's tension mounts (a.k.a. [...] "lugs") assembly is also unique unusual. Using a cut-away lug housing, the traditional tension rod intersects perpendicular to a cylindrical nut (similar to rack-and-pinion) with a nylon plug insert, which once tightened with an <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench</b> makes movement of the tension rod virtually impossible, thus ensuring the drum will stay in tune longer. Ayotte's TuneLock tension system is guaranteed to be indestructible under normal use.|$|E
50|$|The Standards also {{introduced}} the rollsign to the New York City Subway, an innovation {{that would be}} repeated on many other rolling stock orders. Older cars had metal signs {{which had to be}} physically removed and replaced to change. Rollsigns simplified the process by allowing train crews to update the sign's display by merely turning a hand crank (which would later be replaced with an <b>allen</b> <b>wrench</b> to prevent tampering in later rolling stock). Early Standards (cars 2000-2499) had the rollsigns installed in the windows behind side door pockets, while later Standards placed them in the upper half of side windows for better visibility.|$|E
50|$|The FCS {{system was}} {{designed}} by Brian A. Whitty in Elanora, Australia, and patented on November 7, 1995. It can be recognized by the 2 tabs on the fins which are designed {{to fit into a}} securing plug that attaches the fin to the board. The fin tabs are placed in slots which are set into the board by the use of a plug that fits flush with the underside of the board. They are secured into these plugs by the use of set screws which can be tightened down by a fin key or <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench.</b> The plug design and use of set screws enables the fin to be easily removed and installed for storage or travel.|$|E
50|$|On December 8, 2008, a {{memorial}} benefit for Gein {{was held at}} the Dragonfly in Los Angeles. It featured Gein's art and an array of friends and fans performing in his honor. The guest list included Ego Plum, Kim Fowley, ex Courtney Love (a band, {{not to be confused with}} former wife of Kurt Cobain) guitarist Lisa Leveridge, Jessicka, <b>Allen</b> <b>Wrench,</b> Lenora Claire, Courtney Cruz, Ramzi Abed, Brian Clark (co-founder of the UnPop art movement to which Gein belonged), Bill Shafer of Hyaena Gallery (his art representative), Damian Crowley, Giddle Partridge, Hollie Stevens, and drag queens Squeaky Blonde and Fade-Dra. Funds raised from the gathering were used to purchase {{a memorial}} plaque in Gein's honor that was placed at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Gein's mother retains possession of his cremains in Florida.|$|E
5000|$|The [...]22 LR 96/22 feeds {{from the}} same {{magazines}} as the popular Ruger 10/22 series. From the factory, it comes with the standard flush-fitting 10-round rotary magazine. Since it shares the magazine with the 10/22, the capacities available for the 96/22 include 10, 25, 50, etc. It utilizes the same v-block and barrels from the late model v-block style Ruger 77/22. Because of this, with an <b>allen</b> <b>wrench,</b> the owner can replace the barrel with a 77/22 barrel. To use a 10/22 barrel, the process {{is the same as}} converting a 10/22 barrel for use in a 77/22. Both the 77/22 and 96/22 have dual, opposed extractors. A slot for the left side extractor must be cut into a 10/22 barrel to use it in a 96/22 or 77/22.|$|E
50|$|System tests {{could be}} {{conducted}} {{in one of two}} ways: In a coded pull station, there is either a test hole on the front (usually activated with an <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench)</b> or a test switch on the inside. Turning the switch one way causes the notification appliances to sound continuously (or in the case of single-stroke bells, ding once). Turning it the other way and then activating the pull allows a silent test to be done in which the station's mechanical parts are checked to ensure proper function. Once pulled, the station would do at least four rounds of code before resetting itself. Coded pulls were typically used in new fire alarm systems until roughly the 1950s, and then occasionally into the 1970s. Until the early 1990s, some panels were made with an extra zone to accommodate any existing coded pull stations. Nowadays, coded pull stations are very rare and almost never seen in working fire alarm systems.|$|E
5000|$|The SpeedLoader bridges {{differ from}} the {{original}} 1977 bridges in that the procedure for changing strings has been made easier. The original string replacement procedure involved cutting the ball-end from a new guitar string, [...] "locking" [...] the freshly cut end into the bridge using an <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench,</b> winding and rough tuning the string by using the machine heads, locking the string at the nut (the second lock of the double-locking system), and finally tuning it utilizing the fine tuners. When old strings are replaced with new strings, the tension provided on the floating bridge becomes slightly different, meaning that adjusting the tuning of one string with its machine head will undoubtedly alter the tuning of the other strings. During the process of rough tuning a Floyd Rose equipped guitar, the locking nut is usually left unlocked throughout the entire string replacement procedure, which facilitates adjusting the tuning of all the strings using the machine heads.|$|E
5000|$|The correct fluid is a {{synthetic}} mineral oil, such as Pentosin ATF-1 or Volkswagen G 052 162 A2. 3.750 liters is usually sufficient for a filter change. The transmission fluid is checked {{from underneath the}} vehicle while running and the transmission in park. This must be completed before the transmission fully warms up. Once running, the drain plug {{on the bottom of}} the transmission oil pan is removed with a 5mm <b>allen</b> <b>wrench.</b> Some fluid will drip out whether oil level is full or low. There is a plastic stack in the hole, similar to a chimney, which keeps all the fluid from running out. This stack maintains the proper level at the proper temperature. If the fluid is [...] "glugging" [...] or just barely running out the bottom hole when the temperature of the transmission is in the range of 95F-113F, no further action is needed. Reinstall drain plug and put fill cap back on. If no fluid comes out, fill the transmission with specified fluid a little at a time until fluid is observed [...] "glugging" [...] or just barely running out the hole in the bottom. No further action is needed. Install drain plug and fill tube cap.|$|E

Airbnb has {{hundreds}} of listings across neighborhoods {{in almost any}} destination city. That new Ikea shelving system you bought just too hard to put together? TaskRabbit can have someone at your door almost instantly, <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench</b> cheerfully in hand. The “sharing economy” is radically transforming transportation, accommodations, personal services, {{and an array of}} other sectors. And this new economic model is growing by leaps and bounds. Legal scholars have begun to examine many aspects of this rapidly emerging phenomenon, but an intriguing dynamic remains underappreciated in the literature. Unlike for earlier generations of disruptive technology, the regulatory response to these new entrants has primarily been at the municipal level. Where AT 2 ̆ 6 T, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and other earlier waves of technological innovation primarily faced federal (and international) regulatory scrutiny, sharing enterprises are being shaped by zoning codes, hotel licensing regimes, taxi medallion requirements, insurance mandates, and similar distinctly local legal issues...|$|E
