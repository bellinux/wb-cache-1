40|$|Aspergillus septic {{arthritis}} {{is a rare}} and serious medical and surgical problem. It occurs mainly in immunocompromised patients. Aspergillus fumigatus {{is the most common}} causative organism followed by Aspergillus flavus. The most common site affected is knee followed by shoulder, ankle, wrist, hip and sacroiliac joint. Debridement and voriconazole are primary treatment of articular <b>aspergilosis.</b> To the best of our knowledge, there are no reported cases of co-infection of tuberculosis (TB) and Aspergillus infecting joints. We report a case of co-infection of TB and A. flavus of hip and knee of a 60 -year-old male, with type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was treated with debridement, intravenous voriconazole, and antitubercular drugs...|$|E
40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{clinical}} utility of enhanced diagnostics on the management of invasive fungal disease in high risk patients within an integrated care pathway and to audit compliance and efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis. Methods A cohort of 549 high risk haematology and stem-cell transplant recipients was followed over a 5 year period. The routine standard of care involved the use of antimould prophylaxis and a neutropenic care pathway utilizing twice weekly antigen and PCR testing. Results Prophylaxis with itraconazole was poorly tolerated and therapeutic levels could not be maintained. Antigen testing and PCR showed good clinical utility in the management of invasive <b>aspergilosis</b> with high sensitivity (98...|$|E
40|$|SM- 8668 (Sch 39304) {{is a new}} oral {{antifungal}} agent which we evaluated in comparison with fluconazole in various fungal infection models. The prophylactic effect of SM- 8668 was excellent against systemic candidiasis, aspergillosis, and cryptococcosis in mice. The 50 % effective dose for SM- 8668 was assessed at 10 days after infection and was 0. 18, 3. 7, and 5. 9 mg/kg (body weight), respectively, for the above-mentioned fungal diseases. Fluconazole was about four times less effective than SM- 8668 against systemic candidiasis and was only slightly effective at doses of 80 and 25 mg/kg against systemic <b>aspergilosis</b> and cryptococcosis, respectively. SM- 8668 was also about four to eight times more active than fluconazole against vaginal candidiasis in rats and against dermatophytic infection in guinea pigs. In addition, topical SM- 8668 was as effective as topical miconazole or tioconazole against skin mycosis in guinea pigs. After oral administration, SM- 8668 showed a maximum concentration in serum {{similar to that of}} fluconazole in both mice and rats, but the elimination half-life and area under the serum concentration-time curve for SM- 8668 were twice those for fluconazole...|$|E
40|$|Although severe fever with {{thrombocytopenia}} syndrome (SFTS) {{was first}} reported from Japan in 2013, the precise clinical features {{and the risk}} factors for SFTS have not been fully investigated in Japan. Ninety-six cases of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) were notified through the national surveillance system between April 2013 and September 2014 in Japan. All cases were from western Japan, and 82 cases (85 %) had an onset between April and August. A retrospective observational study of the notified SFTS cases was conducted to identify the clinical features and laboratory findings during the same period. Of 96 notified cases, 49 (51 %) were included in this study. Most case-patients were of advanced age (median age 78 years) and were retired or unemployed, or farmers. These case-patients {{had a history of}} outdoor activity within 2 weeks before the onset of illness. The median serum C-reactive protein concentration was slightly elevated at admission. Fungal infections such as invasive <b>aspergilosis</b> were found in 10 % of these case-patients. Hemophagocytosis was observed in 15 of the 18 case-patients (83 %) whose bone marrow samples were available. Fifteen cases were fatal, giving a case-fatality proportion of 31 %. The proportion of neurological abnormalities and serum concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase were significantly higher in the fatal cases than in the nonfatal cases during hospitalization. Appearance of neurological abnormality may be useful for predicting the prognosis in SFTS patients...|$|E
40|$|Gliotoxin is a {{secondary}} metabolite of the epipolythiodioxopiperazine family with biologically active internal disulfide bridge. It {{is produced by}} many fungal species, including Aspergillus fumigatus and A. terreus. A. fumigatus, which produces gliotoxin and more than twenty other secondary metabolites, {{is the leading cause}} of invasive aspergillosis. Gliotoxin production in situ influence the development of aspergillosis. This study investigated the in vitro production of gliotoxin in nine A. fumigatus isolates from the upper respiratory tract of immunocompromised patients. The effects of media composition and incubation temperature were studied. Gliotoxin was extracted from biomass and its concentration was semi-quantitatively analysed using thin-layer chromatography. Gliotoxin production was higher in the yeast-extract liquid medium (YES) than in the synthetic Czapek-Dox liquid medium (CZA). Incubation at 37 °C resulted in higher gliotoxin production than at 25 °C, probably because higher temperatures favour expansive growth of the mycelium. Gliotoxin could be detected after three days of incubation at concentrations 4. 06 mg mL- 1 (in YES at 37 °C) and 1. 07 mg mL- 1 (in CZA at 25 °C). YES broth as a medium containing 4 % sucrose and 2 % of yeast extract is a very rich substrate for the production of gliotoxin in vitro. KEY WORDS: <b>aspergilosis,</b> Czapek-Dox liquid medium, yeast-extracted liquid medium, toxicogenicity Mycotoxin gliotoxin (Figure 1) is {{a secondary}} metabolite of many moulds: Aspergillus fumigatus, A. terreus, A. chevalieri, Penicillium terlikowskii, P. obscurum, P. cinerascens, Thermoascus crustaceus, Dichotomomyces cejpii, Trichoderma viride...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Background: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an {{inflammatory}} chronic disease {{characterized by the}} presence of autoantibodies, immunocomplex production and organ injury. Several alterations of the immune system have been described, namely of CD 4 T cells, with particular focus on regulatory subgroup. Objective: Quantify peripheral CD 4 T cells in a population of patients with SLE and correlate it with lupus activity, affected organs, therapeutics and infections. Methods: Retrospective study involving all SLE patients seen in the clinical immunology outpatient clinic of the Hospital Geral Santo António, Porto that has done some peripheral blood flow cytometry study. Results: Twenty-nine patients have been evaluated, 16 were taking glucocorticoids and six immunossupressors. The mean SLEDAI at the study time was nine and the ECLAM was three. Thirty-one percent of the patients had leukopenia, 76 % lymphocytopenia and the same number CD 4 depletion. Fifty-five percent of the patients had CD 4 levels lower than 500 /mm 3, 31 % lower than 200 /mm 3. All patients with SLEDAI ? 20 and ECLAM ? 4 had CD 4 counts inferior to 500 /mm 3 and all patients with inactive disease had CD 4 superior to 500 /mm 3. There have been three opportunistic infections: cryptococcal meningitis, pulmonary <b>aspergilosis,</b> Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, all in patients with CD 4 counts lower than 500 /mm 3. Conclusion: Decreased CD 4 T cells counts have been very common in this study population. There is an inverse relation between CD 4 cells counts and disease activity. Opportunistic infections occurred in patients with severe CD 4 depletion. Keywords: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; CD 4 T Lymphocytes; Lymphocytopenia; SLE Activity; Opportunistic infection...|$|E
40|$|Las terapias utilizadas en la actualidad para el tratamiento de infecciones fúngicas invasoras causadas por hongos oportunistas están lejos de ser las óptimas, y a pesar de los avances realizados en las últimas décadas, estas infecciones siguen asociadas a altas tasas de mortalidad. El objetivo {{principal}} de esta tesis ha sido contribuir al desarrollo experimental de nuevos tratamientos o a la mejora de los ya existentes frente a infecciones sistémicas como las candidiasis, <b>aspergilosis</b> y mucoramicosis. Para ello, se han realizado estudios {{in vitro}} e in vivo en modelos animales adecuados que han permitido comprobar la eficacia de diferentes fármacos. The treatment of invasive mycoses is far {{to be the}} optimal and despite advances {{made in the last}} decades these infections continue to be associated with high mortality rates. The main goal of this thesis was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of new therapeutical strategies against systemic infections such as candidiasis, aspergillosis and mucoramycosis. The best in vivo efficacy of echinocandins in the treatment of infections by Candida parapsilosis was only observed among those mice infected with the strains that showed the lowest MICs. Posaconazole showed good efficacy against infections by Aspergillus terreus. The voriconazole in vitro data could be useful for predicting the outcome of A. terreus infections; while A. fumigatus isolates showed important variability in their in vivo response to this drug. Amphotericin B was the most effective drug for the treatment of infections by Mucor circinelloides. Posaconazole and amphotericin B showed efficacy in the treatment of Apophysomyces variabilis infections. Posaconazole had the greatest efficacy in our model of disseminated infection by Saksenaea vasiformis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPrimary {{pulmonary}} scar carcinoma with triplicate differentiation is very rare. A 66 -year-old woman {{presented with}} cough, and consulted {{to a private}} hospital, where she was pointed out to have abnormal lung shadow by chest X-P. She was admitted to our hospital for scrutiny. Imaging modalities including chest X-P, CT, and MRI revealed a main tumor (35 mm in diameter) in the right lower lobe and multiple small metastases in both lungs. Biopsies and cytology revealed an adenocarcinoma. Metastasis to the liver, iliac bone and tibia bone were also detected. She was diagnosed as stage IV lung adenocarcinoma (T 2 N 3 M 1), and received chemotherapy. Soon, she complained of right hemiparesis, and brain CT revealed multiple brain metastases. She died of respiratory failure due to bronchopneumonia 7 months after admission. An autopsy revealed a lung tumor (4 × 4 × 3 cm) in the right lower lobe. Miliary micrometastases were recognized in bilateral lungs, brain, bones, pleura, liver, brain, and systemic lymph nodes. The lungs showed bronchopneumonia. The liver was cirrhotic. Microscopically, the primary lung tumor consisted of adenocarcinoma element (70 % in area), squamous cell carcinoma element (20 %), and small cell carcinoma element (10 %), {{all of which were}} embedded in a fibroelastic scar with calcification (scar carcinoma). There were gradual merges between the adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma elements, but the small cell carcinoma element was isolated. The liver metastases were composed only of small cell carcinoma, and other metastatic sites consisted of adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma. Other pathologic changes included pulmonary <b>aspergilosis,</b> bronchopneumonia, splenomegaly, emphysema, cardiac hypertrophy, and kidney congestion. The present case shows that a lung scar carcinoma can display triplicate differentiations...|$|E
