5|$|Final Fantasy IV {{introduced}} Square's <b>Active</b> <b>Time</b> Battle (ATB) system, which {{differed from}} the turn-based designs of previous RPGs. The ATB system centers on the player inputting orders for the characters in real time during battles. The system was used in many subsequent Square games.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy IX {{offers a}} new {{approach}} to town exploration with the introduction of <b>Active</b> <b>Time</b> Events (ATE). These allow the player to view events unfolding at different locations, providing character development, special items and prompts for key story-altering decisions. ATE are occasionally used to simultaneously control two teams when the party is divided to solve puzzles and navigate mazes.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy Dimensions {{features}} 2D {{graphics and}} a Job Change System {{similar to that}} of Final Fantasy V. Its battle system is a variation of the Final Fantasy series's <b>Active</b> <b>Time</b> Battle system. The game follows two parties, the Warriors of Light and the Warriors of Darkness, with players controlling up to five party members at a time in battle, on their quest to reform their shattered world and foil the dark plans of the Avalon Empire.|$|E

5|$|November 1890 was an <b>active</b> <b>time</b> in the sport. In Baldwin City, Kansas, on November 22, 1890, college {{football}} was first {{played in the}} state of Kansas. Baker beat Kansas 229. On the 27th, Vanderbilt played Nashville (Peabody) at Athletic Park and won 400. It was the first time organized football played {{in the state of}} Tennessee.

5|$|The battle system, {{called the}} Style-Change <b>Active</b> <b>Time</b> Battle system, uses {{elements}} from the <b>Active</b> <b>Time</b> Battle (ATB)-based Paradigm {{system from the}} first and second XIII games and bears similarities to the dressphere system featured in Final Fantasy X-2. Lightning has access to several customizable outfits (garb) with different power sets (plural: Schemata; singular: Schema). Each garb has its own separate ATB gauge, and actions for them are mapped onto the controller's face buttons, meaning that the usual menu-style ATB battle system is no longer needed: this enables Lightning to be moved around the battle field to a limited degree. The majority of the garbs and their accessories are either purchasable in the in-game shops or received upon completing quests. Stronger garbs, items, shields and weapons are unlocked in Hard Mode, along with access to more challenging areas and boss battles. Lightning can equip three Schemata directly, while having additional slots for backup costumes which can be equipped outside battle. She can be equipped with a close-combat weapon (sword, spear, etc.), a shield and a cosmetic accessory. The color scheme of each garb can be customized using both pre-set and custom color: there are options to alter both specific portions and all portions of the costume.|$|E
5|$|Battles are {{triggered}} {{when the}} player encounters an enemy in the overworld. Battles {{take place in}} a themed arena, using a version of the <b>Active</b> <b>Time</b> Battle system: each side is given a turn in which to perform an action such as attacking. Each side can also interrupt an opponent's action, prolonging their waiting time. At the end of battle, players are granted experience points, which raise their experience level and boost their maximum health and statistics, in addition to in-game currency. Players can form a three-strong party to fight monsters, explore and battle alone, or loan non-active player characters of a similar or lower experience level for a fee, which are then controlled in battle by the game's artificial intelligence. Any character can be loaned to three different people, and the loaned character keeps the experience points and gold that they have earned.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy VI is menu-based, {{in which}} the player selects an action {{from a list of}} such options as Fight, Magic, and Item. A maximum of four {{characters}} may be used in battles, which are based on the series' traditional <b>Active</b> <b>Time</b> Battle (ATB) system first featured in Final Fantasy IV. Under this system, each character has an action bar that replenishes itself at a rate dependent on their speed statistic. When a character's action bar is filled, the player may assign an action. In addition to standard battle techniques, each character possesses a unique special ability. For example, Locke possesses the ability to steal items from enemies, while Celes' Runic ability allows her to absorb most magical attacks cast until her next turn.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda slow loris is nocturnal and arboreal, {{typically}} {{occurring in}} evergreen forests. It prefers rainforests with continuous dense canopies {{and has an}} extremely low metabolic rate compared to other mammals of its size. Its diet consists of sap, floral nectar, fruit and arthropods. It will feed on exudates such as gum and sap by licking wounds in trees. The species is generally solitary; one study showed only 8% of its <b>active</b> <b>time</b> was spent near other individuals. Social behavior makes up a very {{small part of the}} activity budget, though it has monogamous mating system with the offspring living with the parents. It sleeps during the day, rolled up in a ball in hidden parts of trees above the ground, often on branches, twigs, palm fronds, or lianas. The species is polyoestrous, usually giving birth to a single offspring after a gestation period of 192 days. The young disperses between 16 and 27 months, generally when it is sexually mature.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda slow loris may {{fit into}} the monogamous single male/single female social system, though are mainly known to be solitary. One study showed only 8% of the species' <b>active</b> <b>time</b> was spent near other individuals. Where home ranges overlap, spatial groups are formed. These groups consist of one male, one female and up to three younger individuals. The {{interactions}} between these individuals are largely friendly; they include allogrooming, following, pant-growling, and click-calling, although social behaviors only make up around 3% of the activity budget. When it comes into contact with conspecifics from other home ranges there is usually no reaction as home ranges are not defended. In captivity however, it can be aggressive with other individuals. Males have shown antagonistic behaviors such as attacks, pursuits, threats, assertion, fighting, and subordination. The fighting often results in serious injury. Despite this, they {{are known to be}} generally sociable in captivity, with allogrooming being the most common social behavior.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} and graphics received positive reviews. Although IGN {{felt that the}} in-depth character traits in Final Fantasy IX could be generally found in other Final Fantasy games, it still found the characters to be engaging and sympathetic. GameSpot found the characters, up to their dialogue and traits, amusing and full of humor. IGN {{also noted that the}} <b>Active</b> <b>Time</b> Event system helps to expand the player's understanding of the characters' personalities as they question many ideas and emotions. Their semi-deformed appearance, which also covers monsters of every size, contain detailed animation and design. They gave praise to the pre-rendered backgrounds, noting the careful attention given to the artwork, movement in animations and character interactivity. The movies are seen as emotive and compelling, and the seamless transition and incorporation to the in-game graphics helped to move the plot well.|$|E
5|$|As in Final Fantasy XII, {{enemies are}} {{integrated}} into the open field and can be approached or avoided by the player. When the player's character touches an enemy, the screen transitions from the regular map to a separate battle screen {{similar to those used}} in previous Final Fantasy titles. A maximum of three characters may be used in battles, which use a variant on the series' traditional <b>Active</b> <b>Time</b> Battle (ATB) system first featured in Final Fantasy IV. Under this system, the player selects an action from the menus, such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Unlike previous games in the series, the player only controls the lead character while the remaining two characters are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). Each action requires a specific number of slots on the ATB bar, which continually refills to a set maximum number of slots. The ATB bar gradually increases in size throughout the game from two slots to six. The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions, or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as can be done with the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB slots with actions chosen automatically. Actions cannot be performed outside of battle, and the characters' health is fully restored after each battle.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{is almost}} {{identical}} to the previous game's version of the series' <b>Active</b> <b>Time</b> Battle (ATB) system, called the Command Synergy Battle system. Under this system, the player selects an action from the menus, such as Attack, Abilities, or Item. Each action requires a specific number of slots on the ATB bar, which continually refills at a constant rate to a set maximum number of slots. The kinds of attack actions available are close-range melee attacks or ranged magical attacks, {{but there are also}} other magical actions that evoke healing or shielding abilities. The ATB bar can be increased in size throughout the game from three slots to six. The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as can be done with the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB slots with actions chosen automatically. Actions cannot be performed outside of combat, and the characters' health is fully restored after each fight. Players have the option of restarting a battle while {{in the middle of a}} fight. During some skirmishes, players are put through quick time events called Cinematic Actions that allows them to deal higher damage to foes and end certain battles.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a statistical study of average characteristics of the energetic ion population at geosynchronous altitudes, using energetic-ion (1 - 300 keV/e) measurements from the CHEM spectrometer aboard the AMPTE Charge Composition Explorer between January 1985 and June 1987. Data were sorted into four MLT groups and two extreme geomagnetic activity levels ('very quiet' for AE less than 30 nT and 'very active' for AE greater than 700 nT). A clear quiet-time dayside feature found in the measurements was a dip in H(+) and He(2 +) spectra, at 6. 6 keV/e in the prenoon sector and at 3. 5 keV/e in the postnoon sector. During <b>active</b> <b>times,</b> the ion fluxes increased (except for He(+)), and the O(+) contribution to the total energy density increased dramatically.

The internal events exhibit the same power law index in both <b>active</b> and quiet <b>times.</b> These features are consistent with a simple avalanche ('sandpile') numerical model...|$|R
5|$|Enemy {{encounters}} {{trigger a}} combat mode. As in Chrono Trigger, enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush {{the party and}} thus are not random. Similar to Final Fantasys <b>Active</b> <b>Time</b> Battle, each character has a meter that gradually fills with time. When the meter is full, characters can physically attack enemies, use MysTech magic, unleash BattleSkill attacks, use items, move to a different position, or use a nearby object to attack, if present. For playable characters and computer-controlled enemies, each attack has their number of hit points (a numerically based life bar) get reduced, which can be restored through healing items or MysTech slags. Use of MysTech and equippable shield cells require Neutron-Radiated Glodents (NRG), a separate energy reserve displayed beneath a character's life bar. NRG is replenished through certain items. Use of BattleSkills require Bouge, a third bar beneath NRG that automatically fills with time; players can use different BattleSkills depending on how full the Bouge bar is. Some characters must undergo certain plot developments to unlock their BattleSkills. When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints. If all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved game. Winning battles earns experience points and raises characters' levels, granting them improved statistics. These statistics can be viewed through the status screen, which displays important character information and current quests. Unlike many other RPGs, Anachronox displays a character's attributes with qualitative descriptors (such as Poor and Excellent) instead of integers.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{initially}} going to feature online elements, offered through Square's PlayOnline service. The features, however, were dropped during production, and online gaming would not {{become part of}} the Final Fantasy series until Final Fantasy XI. Map director Nakazato wanted to implement a world map concept with a more realistic approach than that of the traditional Final Fantasy game, in line with the realism of the game's 3D backgrounds, as opposed to pre-rendered backgrounds. As a player of the games in the Final Fantasy series, battle director Tsuchida wanted to recreate elements he found interesting or entertaining, which eventually led to the removal of the <b>Active</b> <b>Time</b> Battle system, and instead, incorporated the strategy-focused Conditional Turn-Based Battle system. Originally, Final Fantasy X was going to feature wandering enemies visible on the field map, seamless transitions into battles, and the option for players to move around the landscape during enemy encounters. Battle art director Shintaro Takai has explained that it was his intention that battles in Final Fantasy X come across as a natural part of the story and not an independent element. However, due to hardware limitations, this idea was not used. Instead, a compromise was made, whereby some transitions from the field map to the battle map were made relatively seamless with the implementation of a motion blur effect that would happen {{at the end of an}} event scene. The desire for seamless transitions also led to the implementation of the new summoning system seen in the game. Kitase has explained that the purpose behind the Sphere Grid is to give players an interactive means of increasing their characters' attributes, such that they will be able to observe the development of those attributes firsthand. The developers experienced difficulty with the scene of Tidus and Yuna kissing, as they were not used to animating romance scenes. Visual Works director Kazuyuki Ikumori stated that this was due to the use of 3D models in the scene. Because of the negative response from female members of staff, the scene was remade multiple times.|$|E

Subjects and MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted on {{a convenience sample of}} 1, 165 youth using the 2009 Styles Surveys; data were weighted to approximate the Current Population Survey. We calculated descriptive statistics and conducted multivariable logistic regression to identify characteristics associated with <b>active</b> screen <b>time</b> by estimating adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95 percent confidence intervals (CIs). ResultsThe sample comprised 51. 4 percent boys, and almost 60 percent were non-Hispanic white. The prevalence of <b>active</b> screen <b>time</b> 22 ̆ 03051 hour/day was 31. 2 percent on a typical school day and 41. 6 percent on a typical weekend day. Logistic regression revealed youth with physical activity of 322 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 5 days/week had higher odds of <b>active</b> screen <b>time</b> 22 ̆ 03051 hour/day compared with youth with no physical activity (aOR school day = 2. 8, 95 percent CI 1. 522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 5. 2; aOR weekend day = 2. 3, 95 percent CI 1. 422 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 3. 9). Certain characteristics (i. e., sex, age group, race/ethnicity, income, and sedentary screen time) were significantly associated with <b>active</b> screen <b>time</b> 22 ̆ 03051 hour/day, but associations were inconsistent for school and weekend days. ConclusionsThree in 10 youth are engaging in at least 1 hour of <b>active</b> screen <b>time</b> on school days, and about 4 in 10 youth are engaging in at least one hour on weekend days. Understanding the use of <b>active</b> screen <b>time</b> and associated characteristics are important for developing interventions addressing screen time and physical activity.

This study is motivated by {{the results from the}} CRRES mission, which revealed a local maximum in the electric field developing near Earth during storm times, rather than the expected enhancement at higher L shells that is shielded near Earth as suggested by the Volland‐Stern model. The CRRES observations were limited to the duskside, while THEMIS provides complete local time coverage. We show strong agreement with the CRRES results on the duskside, with a local maximum near L = 4 for moderate levels of geomagnetic activity and evidence of strong electric fields inside L = 3 during the most <b>active</b> <b>times.</b> The extensive data set from THEMIS also confirms the day/night asymmetry on the duskside, where the enhancement is closest to Earth in the dusk‐midnight sector, and is farther away closer to noon.
