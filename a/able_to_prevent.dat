5|$|A related {{issue to}} the classic horizon problem arises because in most {{standard}} cosmological inflation models, inflation ceases well before electroweak symmetry breaking occurs, so inflation should not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> large-scale discontinuities in the electroweak vacuum since distant parts of the observable universe were causally separate when the electroweak epoch ended.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, media mogul Ted Turner {{announced}} he would begin colourising black-and-white motion pictures {{to make them more}} pleasing to audiences watching his cable networks. The announcement generated extensive controversy. Touring Turner's colourisation facilities {{as a member of the}} Directors Guild, Wise learned that Turner was colourising The Haunting. Wise was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the colourisation by pointing to his contract, which stated the picture could only be in black-and-white.|$|E

American forces were continually repulsed but <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the North Koreans from breaking the Pusan Perimeter.

5|$|By this time, the US 2nd Infantry Division {{suffered}} 1,120 killed, 2,563 wounded, 67 {{captured and}} 69 missing during its time at Pusan Perimeter.

5|$|During the 1860s and the American Civil War, the {{legislature}} {{was the scene}} of intense debate. At the beginning of the war, the General Assembly was controlled by the southern sympathetic Democrats. Governor Oliver Morton and the Republican minority were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the General Assembly from meeting in 1862 and 1863 by denying the body quorum. Morton even had some members of the body arrested or detained on suspicions of disloyalty. The lack of funding created by this crisis again led to the near bankruptcy of the state. In 1864, the Republicans gained a majority and convened the General Assembly to remedy the state's funding problems.|$|E

Out of desperation, Frieza had destroyed Earth but with Whis' do over ability, Goku was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> Frieza from destroying the Earth after being too over confident against {{him in the first place}} and destroys him once more.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Leo, another cardinal had died, {{reducing the number}} of cardinal electors in the May conclave to 59. At the beginning of the conclave Alessandro Peretti di Montalto supported Antonio Sauli. A significant number of the electors loyal to Pietro Aldobrandini, the nephew of Clement VIII, were willing to support Sauli. Aldobrandini, however, opposed Sauli's election due to Sauli's previous opposition to electing Clement, and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> Sauli from reaching the two-thirds majority required for election.|$|E

After Pandu kills a henchman of Narayana, he is confronted by Pasupathy and is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> Shruti from being molested. She meets him {{the next day to}} thank him, and Pandu introduces himself as a self-employed person who undertakes any activity for money.

5|$|The Battle of Battle Mountain was an {{engagement}} between United Nations (UN) and North Korean (NK) forces {{early in the}} Korean War from August 15 to September 19, 1950, on and around the Sobuk-san mountain area in South Korea.

5|$|The Committee {{hoped to}} avoid the Germans {{becoming}} involved in the day-to-day administration of the territory as they had during World War I, while also allowing Belgium to maintain a degree of national autonomy and independence. The Committee also hoped to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the implementation of more radical German policies, like forced labor and deportation. The legal basis of the Committee was a law of 7 September 1939, through which in times of crisis, a Secretary-General could exert full control over his own department, but without having the full status of being a minister.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of calcium}} channel blockers, {{thought to be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the spasm of blood vessels by {{preventing}} calcium from entering smooth muscle cells, has been proposed for prevention. The calcium channel blocker nimodipine when taken by mouth improves outcome if given between the fourth and twenty-first day after the bleeding, {{even if it does}} not reduce the amount of vasospasm detected on angiography. In traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine does not affect long-term outcome, and is not recommended. Other calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate have been studied, but are not presently recommended; neither is there any evidence that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously.|$|E

5|$|Washed {{up and out}} of {{the public}} eye, Keating pleads with Toohey to use his {{influence}} to get the commission for the much-sought-after Cortlandt housing project. Keating knows his most successful projects were aided by Roark, so he asks for Roark's help in designing Cortlandt. Roark agrees in exchange for complete anonymity and Keating's promise that it will be built exactly as designed. After taking a long vacation with Wynand, Roark returns to find that Keating was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> major changes from being made in Cortlandt's construction.

5|$|At {{the heart}} of the Combine's command {{structure}} in Half-Life 2 is the Citadel, an enormous structure of Combine construction, reaching approximately 2.6 kilometres (1.6 miles) into the sky from ground level, and delving deep underground. Located within City 17, the Citadel serves as the primary headquarters of the Combine, housing both Combine Advisors and the office of the Earth administrator, Wallace Breen. Breen is frequently seen on large screens around the city from which he spreads propaganda. The Citadel projects an energy field that is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> human reproduction, as well as a field that keeps dangerous alien wildlife out of the city. In addition, the Citadel contains a trans-dimensional teleporter which allows the Combine to travel between their native universe and Earth. The Citadel also contains construction facilities for various synthetic Combine combat machines.|$|E

Beyond 1% divergence is achieved, but the divergence meter gives a strange output and none of Okabe's friends have any memories of him. In this worldline, Okabe and Faris are a couple and live together, participating in Rainet Access Battlers card game tournaments. Although disappointed that none of his friends remember him, Okabe is still satisfied that he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> Mayuri's death.

5|$|The US {{casualty}} count at Yongsan is also {{difficult to}} know, as the division's scattered units were engaged {{all along the}} Naktong Bulge without communication and total casualty counts in each area could not be ascertained. The US 2nd Infantry Division suffered 1,120 killed, 2,563 wounded, 67 captured and 69 missing during its time at the Second Battle of Naktong Bulge. This included about 180 casualties it suffered during the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the previous month.

5|$|The {{men in the}} Castle Inn {{retreated to}} Penydarren House, who were joined by the initial {{reinforcements}} from the Yeomanry, bringing the establishment's numbers to around 300, {{not all of them}} were armed and able to fight. They faced increasingly well-armed insurgents and Bute became increasingly concerned {{about the quality of the}} opposition facing his men. Bute sent spies into the insurgency, and nearby Cyfarthfa Castle was pressed into service as an observation post. Bute mobilised military pensioners, and used them to start to bring Penydarren House additional weaponry from Cardiff; he was advised to be careful, however, in case the shipments fell into the hands of the insurgency. Morgan's forces were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the radical crowds from entering either Penydarren or Cyfartha, and Bute arrested potential insurgents in Cardiff.|$|E

A letter obtained from one of the thieves, reveals that the plot has been orchestrated by Müsstler, a political agitator who means Borduria to annex the country. In Borduria, Tintin commandeers a fighter plane and flies to Klow, but the Syldavian military shoot him down. He continues to Klow on foot, and (with the help of Snowy), restores the sceptre to the King.|$|E
