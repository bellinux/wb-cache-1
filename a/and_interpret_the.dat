5|$|The {{revival of}} {{interest}} in inland waterways {{following the end of}} the Second World War has resulted in the tow path alongside the canal becoming part of the Itchen Way long-distance footpath, and is a popular route for walkers. The Itchen Navigation Preservation Society was formed in the 1970s, but progress was slow. A joint venture between the Environment Agency and the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust in 2005 {{led to the formation of}} the Itchen Navigation Trust, and two years later, they obtained a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, funding the creation of the Itchen Navigation Heritage Trail Project, which has sought to conserve <b>and</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> remains. The route provides habitat for a diverse flora and fauna, which has resulted in it being designated as a European Special Area of Conservation and a Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1519, Zwingli {{gave his}} first sermon in Zurich. Deviating from the {{prevalent}} practice of basing a {{sermon on the}} Gospel lesson of a particular Sunday, Zwingli, using Erasmus' New Testament as a guide, began to read through the Gospel of Matthew, giving his interpretation during the sermon, known as the method of lectio continua. He continued to read <b>and</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> book on subsequent Sundays {{until he reached the}} end and then proceeded in the same manner with the Acts of the Apostles, the New Testament epistles, and finally the Old Testament. His motives for doing this are not clear, but in his sermons he used exhortation to achieve moral and ecclesiastical improvement which were goals comparable with Erasmian reform. Sometime after 1520, Zwingli's theological model began to evolve into an idiosyncratic form that was neither Erasmian nor Lutheran. Scholars do not agree on the process of how he developed his own unique model. One view is that Zwingli was trained as an Erasmian humanist and Luther played a decisive role in changing his theology. Another view is that Zwingli did not pay much attention to Luther's theology and in fact he considered it as part of the humanist reform movement. A third view is that Zwingli was not a complete follower of Erasmus, but had diverged from him as early as 1516 and that he independently developed his theology.|$|E

25|$|The Imamate of the Shia {{encompasses}} {{far more}} of a prophetic function than the Caliphate of the Sunnis. Unlike Sunni, Shias believe special spiritual qualities have been granted not only to Muhammad but also to Ali and the other Imams. Twelvers believe the imams are immaculate from sin and human error (ma'sūm), and can understand <b>and</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> hidden inner meaning of the teachings of Islam. In this way the Imams are trustees (wasi) who bear the light of Muhammad (Nūr Muhammadin).|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, impetus was growing for the {{creation}} of a Heritage Corridor to document, preserve <b>and</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> I Canal, and in 1984 President Ronald Reagan signed the legislation to create it.

Reagan recognized the Gaylord Building and the project by personally presenting Mr. Donnelley with a President’s Award for Historic Preservation, and the project and became a model for preserving historic sites for new uses.|$|E
25|$|One theory {{claims that}} myths are {{distorted}} accounts of historical events. According to this theory, storytellers repeatedly elaborate upon historical accounts until {{the figures in}} those accounts gain the status of gods. For example, {{the myth of the}} wind-god Aeolus may have evolved from a historical account of a king who taught his people to use sails <b>and</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> winds. Herodotus (fifth-century BC) and Prodicus made claims of this kind. This theory is named euhemerism after mythologist Euhemerus (c.320 BC), who suggested that Greek gods developed from legends about human beings.|$|E

25|$|Later {{most of the}} Shia, {{including}} Twelver and Ismaili, became Imamis. Imami Shia {{believe that}} Imams are the spiritual and political successors to Muhammad.

The words and deeds of Muhammad and the imams are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin, and must be chosen by divine decree, or nass, through Muhammad.|$|E
25|$|Egyptologists {{and historians}} {{disagree}} {{about how to}} interpret the paintings of Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep. Some scholars believe that the paintings reflect an example of homosexuality between two married men and prove that the ancient Egyptians accepted same-sex relationships. Other scholars disagree <b>and</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> scenes as an evidence that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep were twins, even possibly conjoined twins. No matter what interpretation is correct, the paintings show {{at the very least}} that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep must have been very close to each other in life as in death.|$|E
25|$|According to William Cohn, {{television}} programs are typically {{the main source}} used by the American public to know about <b>and</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> past. The Soviet media proved somewhat disorganized as it was unable to generate a coherent popular history. Khrushchev lost power and was airbrushed out of the story. Cuba was no longer portrayed as a heroic David against the American Goliath. One contradiction that pervaded the Soviet media campaign was between the pacifistic rhetoric of the peace movement that emphasizes the horrors of nuclear war and the militancy {{of the need to}} prepare Soviets for war against American aggression.|$|E
