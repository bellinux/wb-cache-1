Inhibitors of H 3 K 9 methylation activates the expression of LC 3 B, as well as other autophagy-related genes, and promotes <b>autophagy</b> <b>process.</b> <b>However,</b> the detailed mechanisms of autophagy regulated by nuclear factors remain elusive. In this study, we performed a drug screen of SMYD 2 -/- cells and discovered that SMYD 2 deficiency enhanced the cell death induced by BIX 01294, an inhibitor of histone H 3 K 9 methylation. BIX- 01294 induces accumulation of LC 3 II and autophagy-related cell death, but not caspase-dependent apoptosis. We profiled the global gene expression pattern after treatment with BIX- 01294, in comparison with rapamycin. BIX- 01294 selectively activates the downstream genes of p 53 signaling, such as p 21 and DOR, but not PUMA, a typical p 53 target gene inducing apoptosis. BIX- 01294 also induces other autophagy-related genes, such as ATG 4 A and ATG 9 A. SMYD 2 is a methyltransferase for p 53 and regulates its transcription activity. Its deficiency enhances the BIX- 01294 -induced autophagy-related cell death through transcriptionally promoting the expression of p 53 target genes. Taken together, our data suggest BIX- 01294 induces autophagy-related cell death and selectively activates p 53 target genes, which is repressed by SMYD 2 methyltransferase...|$|E

Intriguingly, PLP 2 -TM induces incomplete <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> by increasing the accumulation of autophagosomes but blocking the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Furthermore, PLP 2 -TM interacts with the key autophagy regulators, LC 3 and Beclin 1, and promotes Beclin 1 interaction with STING, the key regulator for antiviral IFN signaling. Finally, knockdown of Beclin 1 partially reverses PLP 2 -TM’s inhibitory effect on innate immunity which resulting in decreased coronavirus replication. These results suggested that coronavirus papain-like protease induces incomplete autophagy by interacting with Beclin 1, which in turn modulates coronavirus replication and antiviral innate immunity.|$|R

40|$|Glioblastoma (GBM) {{remains the}} most {{aggressive}} and lethal brain tumor due to its molecular heterogeneity and high motility and invasion capabilities of its cells, resulting in high resistance to current standard treatments (surgery, followed by ionizing radiation combined with Temozolomide chemotherapy administration). Locus amplification, gene overexpression, and genetic mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are hallmarks of GBM that can ectopically activate downstream signaling oncogenic cascades such as PI 3 K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Importantly, alteration of this pathway, involved also in the regulation of <b>autophagy</b> <b>process,</b> can improve radioresistance in GBM cells, thus promoting the aggressive phenotype of this tumor. In this work, the endogenous EGFR expression profile and autophagy were modulated to increase radiosensitivity behavior of human T 98 G and U 373 MG GBM cells. Our results primarily indicated that EGFR interfering induced radiosensitivity according to a decrease of the clonogenic capability of the investigated cells, and an effective reduction of the in vitro migratory features. Moreover, EGFR interfering resulted in an increase of Temozolomide (TMZ) cytotoxicity in T 98 G TMZ-resistant cells. In order to elucidate {{the involvement of the}} <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> as pro-death or pro-survival role in cells subjected to EGFR interfering, the key autophagic gene ATG 7 was silenced, thereby producing a transient block of the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process.</b> This <b>autophagy</b> inhibition rescued clonogenic capability of irradiated and EGFR-silenced T 98 G cells, suggesting a pro-death autophagy contribution. To further confirm the functional interplay between EGFR and autophagy pathways, Rapamycin-mediated autophagy induction during EGFR modulation promoted further impairment of irradiated cells, in terms of clonogenic and migration capabilities. Taken together, these results might suggest a novel combined EGFR-autophagy modulation strategy, to overcome intrinsic GBM radioresistance, thus improving the efficacy of standard treatments. J.

The role of CMA remains largely underappreciated in autoimmune diseases, even though CMA has been claimed to play pivotal functions in MHC class II-mediated antigen processing and presentation. Therefore, hereby, we give a special focus on CMA as a therapeutic target in autoimmune diseases, based in particular on our most recent experimental results where a phosphopeptide modulates lupus disease by interacting with CMA regulators.

Consequently, autophagy is important in providing nutrients to maintain cellular function under starvation, maintaining cellular homeostasis, and promoting cell survival under certain conditions. Several pathways, including mTOR, have been shown to regulate autophagy. However, the impact of lysosomal function impairment on the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> has not been fully explored. Basic lipophilic compounds can accumulate in lysosomes via pH partitioning leading to perturbation of lysosomal function. Our hypothesis is that these types of compounds can disturb the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process.</b> Eleven drugs previously shown to accumulate in lysosomes were selected and evaluated for their effects on cytotoxicity and autophagy using ATP depletion and LC 3 assessment, respectively. All eleven drugs induced increased staining of endogenous LC 3 and exogenous GFP-LC 3, even at non toxic dose levels. In addition, an increase in the abundance of SQSTM 1 /p 62 by all tested compounds denotes that the increase in LC 3 is due to autophagy perturbation rather than enhancement.

Detection of these bacteria in faecal samples of patients with gastroenteritis, and intestinal biopsies and faecal samples of patients with Crohn’s disease, led us to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms used by both C. ureolyticus and C. concisus to infect host cells and cause gastrointestinal disease. Investigation of the ability of C. ureolyticus to interact with intestinal epithelial cell lines showed that it was able to adhere to both Caco- 2 and HT- 29 cell lines. This was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy (ScEM), showing that C. ureolyticus UNSWCD employed a “sticky-end” mechanism to attach to the microvilli of Caco- 2 cells resulting in cellular damage and microvilli degradation. In contrast, gentamicin protection assays revealed that C. ureolyticus was unable to invade either cell line, a finding confirmed by ScEM. Furthermore, addition of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IFN-γ to these cell lines prior to infection had no effect on attachment or invasion. Investigation of the secretome of C. ureolyticus UNSWCD revealed the presence of putative virulence and colonisation factors. Given that previous studies had demonstrated varying abilities of C. concisus strains to invade intestinal cell lines, this thesis explored the potential of C. concisus strains to survive within host cells by manipulating the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process.</b> Gentamicin protection assays revealed that autophagy inhibition resulted in 2 - 4 fold increases in intracellular levels of C. concisus UNSWCD within Caco- 2 cells, whereas autophagy induction resulted in a reduction in intracellular levels or bacterial clearance.

Baseline autophagy {{contributes to the}} maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and autophagic flow is upregulated in response to many adverse conditions, including nutrient or growth factor deprivation, accumulation of unfolded proteins, and intracellular infection. Although autophagy frequently exerts cytoprotective functions by acting as a stress response mechanism, in some settings, it may contribute to the execution of cell death, representing the type 2 programmed cell death. Moreover, <b>autophagy</b> drives key <b>processes</b> in cancer, including glioblastoma (the most frequent and malignant brain tumor in adults). An effective autophagy function may protect cells against the consequences of gene mutation and altered signal pathways leading to tumor initiation, promotion, and progression toward highly aggressive behaviors, such as enhanced proliferation, infiltration, and metastases. Moreover, autophagy activation has been extensively reported as able to modulate effectiveness of current anticancer agents, such as chemotherapy, ionizing radiation, target therapy, and immunotherapy.

Gentamicin protection assays were employed to assess intracellular levels of C. concisus within Caco- 2 cells, following autophagy induction and inhibition. To assess the interaction between C. concisus and autophagosomes, confocal microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were employed. Expression levels of 84 genes involved in the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> were measured using qPCR. Autophagy inhibition resulted in two- to four-fold increases in intracellular levels of C. concisus within Caco- 2 cells, while autophagy induction resulted in a significant reduction in intracellular levels or bacterial clearance.

T 98 G cells showed a high radiosensitivity (especially at low and intermediate doses), associated with autophagy activation, assessed by Beclin- 1 and Atg- 5 expression increase, LC 3 -I to LC 3 -II conversion and LC 3 B-GFP accumulation in autophagosomes of irradiated cells; differently, U 373 MG cells resulted less radiosensitive. Autophagy inhibition, using siRNA against BECN 1 or ATG- 7 genes, totally prevented decrease in viability after both IR and IR/TMZ treatments in the radiosensitive T 98 G cells, confirming the autophagy involvement in the cytotoxicity of these cells after the current GB treatment, contrary to U 373 MG cells.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} and the increasing production of manufactured nanoparticles (NP) are raising safety concerns {{because of the potential}} effects of NP on human health, particularly at the respiratory level. Several studies have shown that exposure to manufactured NP can induce pathogenic biological effects, with lung remodelling (fibrosis, emphysema…), depending on the physicochemical characteristics of the NP. Currently, oxidative stress and inflammation are the most widely accepted paradigms of NP toxicity; however, the exact underlying mechanisms in the biological effects of NP still remain unknown. Autophagy is a physiological process that allows the autodigestion of the subcellar components and which is also involved in the elimination of intracellular pathogens. It has been shown that this process can negatively regulate inflammation and oxidative stress. Thus, the hypothesis {{of this study is that}} a defective autophagy could be a new mechanism explaining, at least in part, NP effects. We choose to focus on TiO 2 NP since it is one of the most abundantly produced and widely used NP. We used seven TiO 2 NPs presenting different physicochemicals properties (size, crystal phase, surface embedding) and compared their effects to those of micron-size TiO 2 and carbon black (CB - for chemical composition effects). NPs were characterized by electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering and X-ray diffraction. Murine macrophages (RAW cell line) were exposed to 50 μg/mL TiO 2 and CB NP for 6 hours. Effects of NP on the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> were analysed by looking at the expression of autophagy markers (LC 3 -II and p 62) and lysosomal proteins (LAMPs and cathepsins). We also analysed the cytoskeleton network by fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, expression of inflammatory cytokines was determined in macrophages exposed to NP. All particles, except the micrometric one, induced an increase of LC 3 -II protein expression, indicating an accumulation of autophagosomes. These particles also increased p 62 protein level, suggesting an autophagy blockade. This perturbation of the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> by NP does not seem to result from a disruption of the cytoskeleton but from a defect in the lysosome function as suggested by a decrease of mature cathepsins expression.

40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that α-synuclein can aggregate {{and contribute to the}} pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative diseases and it is capable of hindering autophagy in neuronal cells. Here, we investigated the implication of α-synuclein in the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> in primary human T lymphocytes. We provide evidence that: (i) knocking down of the α-synuclein gene resulted in increased autophagy, (ii) autophagy induction by energy deprivation was associated with a significant decrease of α-synuclein levels, (iii) autophagy inhibition by 3 -methyladenine or by ATG 5 knocking down led to a significant increase of α-synuclein levels, and (iv) autophagy impairment, constitutive in T lymphocytes from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, was associated with abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates. These results suggest that α-synuclein could be considered as an autophagy-related marker of peripheral blood lymphocytes, potentially suitable for use in the clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Autophagy is a {{cellular}} recycling {{process through which}} a cell degrades old and damaged cellular components such as organelles and proteins and the degradation products are reused to provide energy and building blocks. Dysfunctional autophagy is reported in several pathological situations. Hence, autophagy {{plays an important role}} in both cellular homeostasis and diseased conditions. Autophagy can be studied through various techniques including fluorescence based microscopy. With the advancements of newer technologies in fluorescence microscopy, several novel <b>processes</b> of <b>autophagy</b> have been discovered which makes it an essential tool for autophagy research. Moreover, ability to tag fluorescent proteins with sub cellular targets has enabled us to evaluate <b>autophagy</b> <b>processes</b> in real time under fluorescent microscope. In this article, we demonstrate different aspects of autophagy in two different model organisms i. e. yeast and mammalian cells, with the help of fluorescence microscopy...|$|R
