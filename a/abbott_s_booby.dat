This gain effect only appears when a large resistor is inserted in series with the gate, to produce the conditions for photovoltaic gate biasing.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports on}} post- 1991 census data {{and on the}} {{breeding}} phenology of seabirds of the Chesterfield-Bampton and Bellona groups of coral islets in the Coral Sea. In total, 13 resident bird species were observed [Wedge-tailed Shearwater (Puffinus pacificus), Masked <b>Booby</b> (<b>S.</b> dactylatra), Brown <b>Booby</b> (Sula leucogaster), Red-footed <b>Booby</b> (<b>S.</b> sula), Lesser Frigatebird (Fregata arid), Great Frigatebird (F. minor), Black Noddy (Anous minim's), Brown Noddy A. stolidus), Crested Tern (Sterna bergii), Sooty Tern (S. fuscata), Fairy Tern (S. nereis), Black-naped Tern (S. sumatrana), and Buff-banded Rail (Gallirallus philippensis) ]. Segregation for nesting habitat {{was similar to that}} previously observed on other coral-reef islets of the Coral Sea. Breeding periods were either in the winter (Masked and Red-footed Boobies, Frigatebirds, Fairy Tern) or in the summer (Wedge-tailed Shearwater, Black and Brown Noddies, Crested and Black-naped Terns) or year-round (Brown Booby). Sooty Terns bred twice a year (summer and spring), but this was not consistent across years. Estimates of breeding population sizes for the whole Chesterfield-Bampton and Bellona groups are proposed for Wedge-tailed Shearwater (90, 000 to 106, 000 breeding pairs), Masked Booby (280 - 500 pairs), Brown Booby (3, 800 - 5, 800 pairs), Red-footed Booby (7, 200 - 7, 300 pairs), Lesser Frigatebird (1, 600 pairs), Great Frigatebird (350 - 480 pairs), Black Noddy (29, 000 - 45, 000 pairs), Brown Noddy (15, 000 - 23, 000 pairs), Crested Tern (80 - 100 pairs), Sooty Tern (11, 000 - 46, 000 pairs), and Black-naped Tern (70 - 90 pairs). Interannual fluctuation in breeding population size was apparent in Wedge-tailed Shearwater. Over the last 30 yr, an increase in Brown Booby abundance was noted, whereas declines are suspected for the Fairy Tern and Buff-banded Rail. Among the threats to nesting seabirds are stress and other disturbances caused by human frequentation, including poaching of seabird chicks and introduced mice...|$|R

During the 24 hours spent on the island (19 - 20 June 2007), ten bird species were observed, including five seabirds nesting [great frigatebird, Fregata minor (transect-estimated N= 194 nests), brown booby, Sula leucogaster (N= 1962), red-footed <b>booby,</b> <b>S.</b> sula (N= 1810), black noddy, Anous minutus (N= 6012), and brown noddy, A. stolidus (N= 7082) ], one seabird at the beginning of its reproduction season [masked <b>booby,</b> <b>S.</b> dactylatra (N= 73 individuals) ], one non-nesting seabird (lesser frigatebird, F. ariel), two shorebirds (Pacific golden-plover, Pluvialis fulva, tattler, Tringa sp.) and the banded rail, Gallirallus philippensis. Mice were observed predating on brown noddy eggs.

40|$|Understanding {{the process}} of {{speciation}} requires understanding how gene flow influences divergence. Recent analyses indicate that divergence can take place despite gene flow and that the sex chromosomes can exhibit different levels of gene flow than autosomes and mitochondrial DNA. Using an eight marker dataset including autosomal, z-linked, and mitochondrial loci we tested the hypothesis that blue-footed (Sula nebouxii) and Peruvian (<b>S.</b> variegata) <b>boobies</b> diverged from their common ancestor with gene flow, paying specific attention to the differences in gene flow estimates from nuclear and mitochondrial markers. We found no gene flow at mitochondrial markers, but found evidence from the combined autosomal and z-linked dataset that blue-footed and Peruvian boobies experienced asymmetrical gene flow during or after their initial divergence, predominantly from Peruvian boobies into blue-footed boobies. This gene exchange may have occurred either sporadically between periods of allopatry, or regularly throughout the divergence process. Our results add to growing evidence that diverging species can remain distinct but exchange genes...|$|R
