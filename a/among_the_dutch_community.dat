It {{was said that}} they became involved in a dispute with the Royal College of Physicians, but Arnold {{was lucky enough to}} become personal physician to Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester. Leicester was later appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland and, though he never actually went to Ireland, he may have recommended Arnold to his Irish friends. Arnolds writings had already brought him to the attention of James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh, and it was Ussher who invited Arnold to Ireland in 1636. He became Usshers personal physician, and was later appointed Surgeon-General to the Irish Army. He also built up a flourishing private practice <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> <b>community</b> in Dublin.|$|E
5000|$|On 14 August 1875 Hoogenhout, Du Toit {{and others}} {{established}} the Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners (Society of True Afrikaners) which {{has as its}} objectives {{the promotion of the}} Afrikaans language, nation and country. Initially this was to be achieved by the publication a monthly journal and as soon as was possible, a dictionary and grammatical rules (spraakkuns). Du Toit was elected president of the association and within a year had compiled a set of grammatical rules. [...] In 1876 he launched the first Afrikaans language newspaper Die Afrikaanse Patriot. Initially the paper, a monthly publication, had 50 subscribers, in its second year of publication 400 and by 1881 3000 subscribers, having in 1877 become a weekly publication. Although du Toit could not openly control Die Afrikaanse Patriot without the consent of his church council he was {{the driving force behind the}} paper, while his brother D.F. du Toit (known as Oom Lokomotief) was officially the paper's editor. The British annexation of the Transvaal in 1877 caused considerable anger <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> <b>community</b> in all of Southern Africa. Die Afrikaanse Patriot published a scathing attack and du Toit proposed a boycott of British goods and services and in October 1880 Die Patriot argued that the time had come for decisive action- - many Transvaal leaders state that this was the trigger for the start of the First Boer War which led, in 1881, to the Transvaal regaining its independence.|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: pages 181 - 189. I have {{attempted}} to give a broad description {{of the variety of}} English used by first-language (White) Afrikaans-speakers in the Western Cape. The first chapter outlines the aims of the thesis with respect to the study of English as a world phenomenon. Important work on other varieties of English, notably that of William Labov and that of Lesley Milroy, is discussed, with emphasis on variationist studies. The chapter also includes a description of the methods used for the collection of data. I did not use questionnaires but rather conducted 'participation interviews'. A brief outline of the areas that the informants were selected from is given. Chapters 2 and 3 give the historical and sociolinguistic background of the Afrikaners. This is important, as without an understanding of their history and social circumstances one cannot appreciate their present attitudes to language. The formative history of the Afrikaners includes a description of the policies of the British government at the Cape {{at the beginning of the}} nineteenth century and the subsequent emergence of national identity <b>among</b> <b>the</b> formerly <b>Dutch</b> <b>community.</b> <b>The</b> establishment of such organisations as the Afrikaner Bond, the Broederbond and the Ossewabrandwag all contributed to the identity of the Afrikaners today. The final section of chapter 3 deals with speech communities as well as the concept of social class, as applied to the White South African community. There is a brief outline of the differences between the White and Coloured Afrikaans-speaking communities of the Cape. The third section of this thesis (chapter 4) concerns language: acquisition, in particular theories of second language acquisition. I have outlined the development of (White) education in South Africa, with particular reference to medium of education, and have included a brief description of second language teaching in South Africa today. Bilingualism and,communication strategies are discussed and I have grouped the informants according to their individual level of proficiency in English. The use of code-switching and code-mixing techniques is also discussed in this chapter, with a brief look at the structural differences between English and Afrikaans. The last, and major, part of the thesis, chapters 5 and 6, is a detailed description of the phonology, syntax, morphology and lexis of Afrikaans-English. The features of this variety are compared to those of standard South African English. The presence or absence of features in the speech of the informants is discussed and indicated in the tables given; the core features, i. e. those that are found even in the speech of the most fluent speakers, are noted. It is also shown that although all the features are possible, no single speaker will have the full set of variables in his/her speech. The presence of the features discussed in this section in Afrikaans- English, Coloured English and other, non-South African, varieties of English is shown; the presence of a feature in non-South African varieties of English appears to reinforce the use of that particular feature in Afrikaans-English. It is shown that Afrikaans-English overlaps phonologically with the continuum of first language South African English at either end of the spectrum on the one hand the accent of Afrikaans- English has features in common with Extreme South African English and at the other, LI-fluency end, it is almost indistinguishable from Respectable South African English. Mention is also made of syntactic, morphological and lexical features that spill over into LI varieties of South African English. Finally, I have appended a brief outline of each of the four competence groups and have given annotated extracts from the data for each. I have also included a collection of the comments regarding language made by the informants...|$|R

40|$|This {{examination}} of paintings and prints depicting the Portuguese Jewish community demonstrates the artistic interaction between <b>the</b> Portuguese and <b>Dutch</b> <b>communities</b> in seventeenth-century Amsterdam. In the sympathetic and generally tolerant atmosphere created by <b>the</b> <b>Dutch,</b> this interaction {{occurred during the}} period when {{the members of the}} Portuguese community were reestablishing their Jewish identity following their expulsion from the Iberian Peninsula. Throughout the century, the Portuguese community served as the focus of numerous depictions by well-known artists from <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> <b>community,</b> including Romeyn de Hooghe, Emanuel de Witte, Gerrit Berckheyde, Rembrandt, Jan Lievens, and Jacob van Ruisdael, as well as by several artists from the Portuguese community. These images documented the significant events of the Portuguese community, such as the dedication of the synagogue, and also illustrated important aspects of the community in the form of portraits, messianic images, and depictions of the cemetery. The diversity of the depictions of the Portuguese community is reflected both in the subjects of the images and in their artistic elements. The members of <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> and Portuguese <b>communities</b> purchased depictions in a variety of media (paintings, prints, book and pamphlet illustrations), and in a variety of genres, including history subjects, portraits, architectural scenes and landscapes. These paintings and prints spanned the entire seventeenth century, although generally these images appeared in pockets of concentration which were connected with specific events. Many of the images intended for the Portuguese community commemorated their own specific achievements, while the depictions intended for <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> <b>community</b> documented <b>the</b> presence of the Portuguese community in Amsterdam. When these diverse depictions are examined together within their social and historical context, the degree of artistic interaction between <b>the</b> Portuguese and <b>Dutch</b> <b>communities</b> becomes apparent. <b>The</b> contextual approach of this study highlights documentary and visual evidence which establishes that members of both the Portuguese and <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> <b>community</b> served as patrons of many of these paintings and prints. The images represent the confluent interests of <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> and Portuguese, both of whom celebrated the presence and the accomplishments of the Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam.
