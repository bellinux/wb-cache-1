5|$|Volcanic {{ash fall}} is physically, socially, and {{economically}} disruptive. Volcanic ash can affect both proximal areas and areas {{many hundreds of}} kilometres from the source, and causes disruptions and losses {{in a wide variety}} of different infrastructure sectors. Impacts are dependent on: ash fall thickness; the duration of the ash fall; the grain size and chemistry of the ash; whether the ash is wet or dry; and any preparedness, management and prevention (mitigation) measures employed to reduce effects from the ash fall. Different sectors of infrastructure and society are affected in different ways and are vulnerable to a range of impacts or consequences. These <b>are</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following sections.|$|E

5|$|Maria {{quickly learned}} of her husband's true character. She {{tried to ignore}} him by {{cultivating}} a greater appreciation for literature and the arts, but he became increasingly dissolute: he whored, gambled, and bankrupted the couple. Maria soon became pregnant after unwanted sexual encounters with her husband. As Maria's uncle is leaving for the continent, he warns Maria of the consequences should she leave her husband. This is the first that separation or divorce <b>are</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novel and Maria seems to take his words as inspiration rather than the warning they are meant to be. After Venables attempts to pay {{one of his friends}} to seduce Maria (a man referred to only as 'Mr. S') so that he can leave her for being an adulteress, Maria tries to leave him. She initially escapes and manages to live in several different locations, often with other women who have also been wronged by their husbands, but he always finds her. When she tries to leave England with her newborn child and the fortune her now deceased uncle has left them, her husband seizes the child and imprisons Maria in the asylum. At this point the completed manuscript breaks off.|$|E
