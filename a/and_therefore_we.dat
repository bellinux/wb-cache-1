5|$|Comedy Central {{has decided}} not to air these two episodes of South Park. It is a {{decision}} we've made with great reluctance. Comedy Central believes strongly in creative freedom of expression; when unique and deeply insightful creative talents like those behind South Park are able to express themselves freely, we all benefit. However, the safety of our employees is our unquestioned numberone priority, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>we</b> have decided to take these precautionary measures.|$|E
5|$|Our quarrel is {{not with}} these men, but with those who give them their chance. We {{who believe in the}} study of nature feel that a real {{knowledge}} and appreciation of wild things, of trees, flowers, birds, and of the grim and crafty creatures of the wilderness, give an added beauty and health to life. Therefore we abhor deliberate or reckless untruth in this study as much as in any other; <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>we</b> feel that a grave wrong is committed by all who, holding a position that entitles them to respect, yet condone and encourage such untruth.|$|E
5|$|The {{discussion}} {{which has}} taken place here, and the consideration which {{has been given to}} the facts alleged, most conclusively show {{that this is not a}} case that can admit of no denial or proof to the contrary; under these circumstances, however obnoxious I am myself to the trial by battle, it is the mode of trial which we, in our judicial character, are bound to award. We are delivering the law as it is, and not as we wish it to be, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>we</b> must pronounce our judgment, that the battle must take place.|$|E

25|$|Klaus Wagner proved in 1937 {{that the}} case k=5 is {{actually}} equivalent to the four color theorem <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>we</b> now know it to be true. As Wagner showed, every graph that has no K5 minor can be decomposed via clique-sums into pieces that are either planar or an 8-vertex Möbius ladder, and each of these pieces can be 4-colored independently of each other, so the 4-colorability of a K5-minor-free graph follows from the 4-colorability {{of each of the}} planar pieces.|$|E
25|$|Decisions {{are based}} on the advice of the Amir-ul Momineen. For us {{consultation}} is not necessary. We believe that this is in line with the Sharia. We abide by the Amir's view even if he alone takes this view. There will not be a head of state. Instead there will be an Amir al-Mu'minin. Mullah Omar will be the highest authority and the government {{will not be able to}} implement any decision to which he does not agree. General elections are incompatible with Sharia <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>we</b> reject them.|$|E
25|$|In simple terms, he {{believes}} that the singularity in Einstein's field equation at the Big Bang is only an apparent singularity, similar to the well-known apparent singularity at the event horizon of a black hole. The latter singularity can be removed by a change of coordinate system, and Penrose proposes a different change of coordinate system that will remove the singularity at the big bang. One implication of this is that the major events at the Big Bang can be understood without unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>we</b> are not necessarily constrained by the Wheeler–DeWitt equation, which disrupts time. Alternatively, one can use the Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac equations.|$|E

25|$|He goes on {{to explain}} that in Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, the rule that nothing can go faster than the speed of light, does not apply to galaxies in an {{expanding}} universe. He further explains that while that rule may apply in a preexisting static space, it does not apply in an expanding universe. In an expanding cosmic universe galaxies can travel away from each other at speeds in excess of the speed of light. As a result of this there are galaxies so far away that the light from them have not reached earth yet <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>we</b> don't even know they exist. Ferris refers to this phenomenon as a boundless steadily increasing and changing universe with a changing density.|$|E
25|$|The {{books of}} those that wrote before us survive, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>we</b> are taught about what was written then. For this reason it is good that we also in our time, here among us, write some {{material}} from scratch, inspired by the example of these old customs; so that it might, when we are dead and elsewhere, {{be left to the}} world's ear in the time coming after this. But because men say, and it's true, that when someone writes entirely about wisdom, it often dulls a man's wit who reads it every day. For that reason, if you permit it, I would like to take the middle way, and write a book between the two, somewhat of passion, somewhat of instruction, that whether of high or low status, people may like what I write about.|$|E
500|$|For {{renewal of}} {{previously}} earned scholarships, students generally {{need to be}} within the top 10% of their faculty. For in-course scholarships in particular, students must be within the top 5% of their faculty. McGill itself outlines scholarship considerations as follows: [...] "Competition for basic and major scholarships is intense at McGill. An extraordinary number of exceptional applications are received each year <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>we</b> cannot award scholarships to all good candidates." ...|$|E

[...] Toal stated that the best interest of the child was to be with her father, which also preserved her tribal affiliation.|$|E
500|$|On June 22, 1998 Pusztai {{revealed}} his research findings {{during an interview}} on Granada Television's current affairs programme World in Action titled [...] "Eat up your genes". He was given permission to do the interview by Rowett Institute Director Philip James. Rowett's press officer {{was present at the}} start of filming. During the interview Pusztai said he had [...] "concerns that some of the testing techniques are not up to what we thought it was necessary to do, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>we</b> should have more testing." [...] When asked why he felt concerned, he said [...] "it was because we had done some experiments which made us feel concerned" [...] and discussed his results in general terms.|$|E

500|$|Hamilton {{accepted}} {{responsibility for}} his near stall on the grid: [...] "I hadn't hit the switch early enough <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>we</b> {{were not in the}} launch map and went straight into anti-stall, and when everyone else was in their launch mode, I wasn't." [...] Renault dismissed suggestions that Alonso had brake tested Hamilton in the incident that led to the McLaren's wing breaking off. Pat Symonds, Renault's head of engineering, said his team's telemetry indicated Alonso was on full throttle down the straight, and had not touched the brakes: [...] "I think all I can say from our side {{is that there is no}} blame attributable to Fernando, which is what some of the speculation might be." [...] McLaren F1 CEO Martin Whitmarsh said that Hamilton's front wing had broken seconds before the impact, and that the resulting downforce reduction had sucked Hamilton into Alonso's slipstream faster than expected. However, photos indicate that the front wing on the McLaren could have broken even earlier when Hamilton nudged a car (believed to be Alonso) on the opening lap. The later incident left Alonso with damage to the back of the car, impairing his attempts to pass Glock late in the race.|$|E

His 1985 hit series, A Planet for the Taking, averaged more than 1.8 million viewers per episode and earned him a United Nations Environment Programme Medal. His perspective in this series is summed up in his statement: [...] "We have both a sense {{of the importance of the}} wilderness and space in our culture and an attitude that it is limitless <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>we</b> needn't worry." [...] He concludes with a call for a major [...] "perceptual shift" [...] in our relationship with nature and the wild.|$|E
