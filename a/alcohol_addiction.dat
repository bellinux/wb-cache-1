5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Poe plot, Riley was dismissed from the Democrat, so he returned to Greenfield to spend time writing poetry. Back home, he met Clara Louise Bottsford, a school teacher boarding in his father's home. They found they had much in common, particularly their love of literature. The couple began a twelve-year intermittent relationship which would be Riley's longest lasting. In mid-1878 the couple had their first breakup, caused partly by Riley's <b>alcohol</b> <b>addiction.</b> The event led Riley to make his first attempt to give up liquor. He joined a local temperance organization, but quit after a few weeks.|$|E

5|$|Subterranean Jungle is {{the seventh}} studio album by the American punk rock band the Ramones, {{released}} by Sire Records in February 1983. The album appealed to a hardcore punk rock style rather than featuring several pop oriented pieces; {{this is because}} guitarist Johnny Ramone received more leeway with steering the overall genre with his hard rock influenced riffs. The recording sessions saw disputes between band members, mainly {{because many of the}} band members were dealing with <b>alcohol</b> <b>addiction,</b> or in bassist Dee Dee Ramone's case, cocaine.|$|E
5|$|In October 1887, Riley and the {{association}} joined with other writers to petition the United States Congress {{to attempt to}} negotiate international treaties to protect American copyrights abroad.

When traveling to one of the league's meetings in New York City that year, Riley was struck by Bell's palsy.

5|$|While {{serving in}} Congress, Jennings's health {{continued}} to decline {{as he struggled}} with <b>alcohol</b> <b>addiction</b> and suffered from severe rheumatism. In 1827 ceiling plaster from Jennings's Washington D.C. boarding room fell on his head, severely injuring him, and ill health limited his ability to visit his constituents, but he continued to remain a popular politician in Indiana. In the congressional election of 1826, Jennings ran unopposed. He won reelection in 1828, soundly defeating his opponent, Indiana's lieutenant governor, John H. Thompson. Jennings did not publicly favor a presidential candidate and won the Second District seat with support from voters who favored Jackson and Adams. During Jennings's final term in office House journals show that he introduced no legislation, was frequently not present to vote on matters, and only once delivered a speech. Jennings's friends, led by Senator John Tipton, took note of his situation and took action to block Jennings's reelection bid when his drinking became a political liability. John Carr, anti-Jackson man, opposed Jennings in a six-way race for the congressional seat and won the election. Tipton had arranged for others to enter the race and divide Jennings's supporters. Jennings left office on March 3, 1831.|$|E

He subsequently missed one month of the season after being admitted to Sporting Chance, a clinic run by former England international footballer Tony Adams, for 28 days for treatment for alcohol-related problems. He later had counselling for the problem before returning to action in October 2003. Upon his return to the team, Carlisle won the Second Division Player of the Month award for November 2003. He scored one goal in 39 matches in 2003–04 as Queens Park Rangers finished as runners-up in the league, achieving promotion to the Championship.

Using administrative data, I examine the employment of individuals who lost DI eligibility after the 1996 removal of drug and <b>alcohol</b> <b>addictions</b> as qualifying conditions. Approximately 22 percent started working at levels that would have disqualified them for DI, an employment response that is large relative to their work histories. Those who received DI for 2 - 3 years had the largest response, suggesting that a period of public assistance may maximize the employment of some disabled individuals...|$|R
