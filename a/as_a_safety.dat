5|$|It is {{strongly}} recommended by diver training organisations and {{codes of practice}} that {{a portion of the}} usable gas of the cylinder be held aside <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> reserve. The reserve is designed to provide gas for longer than planned decompression stops or to provide time to resolve underwater emergencies.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{nitrogen}} readily evaporates to form gaseous nitrogen, {{and hence}} the precautions associated with gaseous nitrogen also apply to liquid nitrogen. For example, oxygen sensors are sometimes used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> precaution when working with liquid nitrogen to alert workers of gas spills into a confined space.|$|E
5|$|A {{fusible plug}} is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a tapered hole drilled completely through its length. This hole is sealed {{with a metal}} {{of low melting point}} that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the fusible plug was <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as air conditioning systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E

5|$|As {{a senior}} at Arizona State, he played left halfback and was {{recognized}} as one of the roughest and hardest runners in the country, and as one of the top defensive players <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>safety.</b> He also excelled as a punt returner, and had a two-game stretch in which he returned four punts for touchdowns. Johnson's running abilities made him a standout pro football prospect as a black athlete at a primarily white college.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Roswell High School began renovating {{its main}} entrance. The main office and front desk were {{relocated}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> measure for the administration.

The renovation took down the metal covering leading from the carpool dropoff to the main entrance.|$|E
5|$|In September 1999, {{high winds}} during a heavy storm {{resulted}} in the dislodgement of some domes in the canopy over the building's forecourt. This led to the closure of St Georges Terrace entrance <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> precaution. The building's then-owner, the Government Employees Superannuation Board, subsequently initiated legal action against the tower's builder Multiplex.|$|E
50|$|During {{his seven}} seasons <b>as</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>safety</b> and free safety with the Bengals, {{he played in}} 83 games, {{starting}} 69 of those.

5|$|In {{assessing}} peacefulness, the GPI {{investigates the}} extent to which countries are involved in ongoing domestic and international conflicts. It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might be described <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> and security in society. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences of terrorist acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be equated with peacefulness.|$|E
5|$|Over 50 {{temporary}} shelters {{were made}} available in flood-prone areas across various municipalities in Veracruz. Authorities in Tamaulipas prepared five shelters and mobilized of 10emergency teams to evacuate up to 20,000 people {{in anticipation of}} adverse weather conditions. In Hidalgo, 250shelters were opened and emergency workers were dispatched <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> measure. At the risk of flash flooding, public storm shelters were made available in parts of Oaxaca.|$|E
5|$|The Lights {{were banned}} from photographing all of Central America except Guatemala, Ecuador, and Colombia, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> measure against the {{gathering}} of strategic knowledge.

5|$|The {{consortium}} took {{possession of}} the mill in November 1979. The first priority {{was to make the}} mill as weathertight as possible. Polythene sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure. The mill was surveyed and recorded. In spring 1980, the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> measure. Scaffolding was erected to allow the fanstage to be dismantled, and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Bosnia, Bulgaria, Macedonia (which had pegged their currencies against the Deutsche Mark) and Cape Verde (formerly pegged to the Portuguese escudo), all of these non-EU countries had a currency peg to the French Franc before pegging their currencies to the euro. Pegging a country's currency to a major currency is regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> measure, especially for currencies of areas with weak economies, as the euro {{is seen as a}} stable currency, prevents runaway inflation and encourages foreign investment due to its stability.|$|E
5|$|A {{concrete}} wall was {{built at the}} Grosvenor Road End for over £3,000 in 1956, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> precaution and as a support for additional banking and terracing. These improvements saw capacity extended to 23,600. Two FA Cup ties against First Division opposition were held at the ground in 1957–58: Birmingham City were beaten 3–0, followed by a 0–0 draw with Bolton Wanderers, which drew a capacity crowd of 23,600. Floodlights were installed at {{the ground in the}} summer of 1959, costing £14,500, a substantial part of which was raised by a supporters' club. They were officially switched on for a friendly against Newcastle United on 28 October 1959, which Newcastle won 8–2 before a crowd of 9,414.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{relatively}} strong ground motions, {{damage to}} the area was very limited; structures around the epicenter were a mix of fairly vulnerable and resistant to earthquake shaking. Buildings swayed with the tremor in Mexico City, causing panic among many citizens and prompting some to evacuate. Several schools in Guerrero were evacuated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> precaution. The earthquake and its aftershock sequence contributed to intermittent power outages in Acapulco; more than 40,000 residences in some 40 districts remained without power by the next day. There were no reports of major losses or fatalities {{in the wake of}} the tremor, though two police stations located in Acapulco and Marquelia suffered light damage. Elsewhere, some fallen roof tiles and small landslides occurred east of the epicenter in Cuautepec.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the {{possibility}} of aftershocks, police evacuated shopping malls and office buildings around the city. Essential organisations in the area were evacuated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> precaution, including the police headquarters and offices of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority. At Christchurch International Airport, officials halted operations after the earthquake, but all flights resumed later that day. Months before the event, a severe magnitude 6.3 earthquake occurred in a similar area adjacent to Christchurch, causing widespread destruction and fatalities in the city. Concerns arose about the condition of previously damaged structures, and the 13 June earthquakes caused further distress among many victims. Dozens of dissatisfied residents were expected {{to move out of the}} city, and many others sought professional help for anxiety and depression-related issues.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{features}} on Lexus models range from {{stability and handling}} programs (Vehicle Stability Control and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management) to backup cameras, swivel headlights, and sonar warning systems. The Lexus Pre-Collision System (PCS) integrates multiple safety systems. In 2007, Lexus introduced the first car safety systems with infrared and pedestrian detection capabilities, lane keep assist, a Driver Monitoring System with facial recognition monitoring of driver attentiveness, and rear pre-collision whiplash protection, {{as part of the}} LS 460 PCS. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> precaution, Lexus GPS navigation systems in many regions feature a motion lockout when the vehicle reaches a set speed; to prevent distraction, navigation inputs are limited, while voice input and certain buttons are still accessible. This safety feature has attracted criticism because passengers cannot use certain functions when the vehicle is in motion. Pre-2007 models came with a hidden manufacturer override option, and updated European models allow operation in motion.|$|E

5|$|Sharun {{participated in}} {{training}} camp with the Eskimos in 2010 and practiced with the first team <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>safety,</b> but {{was moved to the}} practice squad when the team was reduced to 46 players. The Eskimos went on to transfer Sharun between the active and practice rosters several times throughout the year. He made his CFL debut on July 11, 2010 against the Montreal Alouettes, and later recorded his first special teams tackle on August 6 against the Toronto Argonauts. In a game against the Saskatchewan Roughriders on August 28, Sharun blocked a punt to set up the Eskimos' only touchdown along the way to scoring 17 unanswered points to win 17–14. In his rookie season, Sharun recorded 16 special teams tackles while playing in 15 regular season games, along with one defensive tackle.|$|E
5|$|The MP 40 submachine {{guns are}} open-bolt, blowback-operated {{automatic}} arms. The only mode of fire was fully automatic, but {{the relatively low}} rate of fire enabled single shots with controlled trigger pulls. The bolt features a telescoping return spring guide {{which serves as a}} pneumatic recoil buffer. The cocking handle was permanently attached to the bolt on early MP 38s, but on late production MP 38s and MP 40s, the bolt handle was made as a separate part. It also served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> by pushing the head of handle into one of two separate notches above the main opening; this action locked the bolt either in the cocked (rear) or uncocked (forward) position. The absence of this feature on early MP 38s resulted in field expedients such as leather harnesses with a small loop, used to hold the bolt in forward position.|$|E
