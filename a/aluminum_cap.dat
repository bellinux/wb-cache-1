40|$|The General Engineering Laboratory has {{submitted}} a cost estimate and a proposal covering the design, fabrication, construction, {{and testing of}} a uranium slug canning machine. This machine will cover requirements for mechanization of only the operations occurring within the aluminum-silicon canning bath.

Stated briefly, the machine is required to insert a prepared uranium slug into an aluminum can and close the can opening with an <b>aluminum</b> <b>cap.</b> All assembly operations {{will be carried out}} beneath a molten bath of standard Hanford aluminum-silicon bonding alloy. The uranium slug is preheated and prewetted before being manually transferred to the slug assembly and quench machine.

40|$|When {{approximating}} {{heat transfer}} through a streambed, {{an understanding of}} the thermal properties of the sediments is essential (e. g., thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and density). Even though considerable research has been completed in this field, little has been done to establish appropriate standard data collection approaches or to compare modeling methods for approximating these properties. Three mixture models were selected for comparison against each other and against a bed conduction model (SEDMOD). Typical data collection approaches were implemented for use in the mixture models while numerous data collection approaches were employed for use within SEDMOD. Sediment samples were taken from the streambed to estimate the necessary parameters for the mixture models (e. g., sediment volume, density, porosity, etc.) and to identify the minerals present. To yield more accurate estimates of the thermal properties from SEDMOD, methods of obtaining sediment temperature profiles representing the influences of conduction only were developed {{through the use of a}} steel cylinder and different capping materials (e. g., using geo-fabric or aluminum). In comparison to laboratory measurements of the thermal properties, it was found that the mixture model that provided the best estimates of the thermal properties was a volume weighted average. The method that best isolated conductive heating from advective heating was the steel cylinder with an <b>aluminum</b> <b>cap.</b> Using this data to calibrate SEDMOD yielded thermal diffusivity values most similar to the laboratory measurements. Due to its ability to estimate both thermal diffusivity and reproduce sediment temperature profiles, SEDMOD is recommended in combination with the aluminum isolation technique...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTwo fiber-optic accelerometer designs are presented. The first accelerometer was constructed using two flexural disks between {{which is a}} center spindle. Six uniformly spaced screws fasten the disk assembly to a circular, hollow base housing fiber-optic couplers and splices and providing fiber access. The disk edge is elastically restrained. A flat spirally wound coil of optical fiber is bonded to on surface of each disk. Disk surface strains, caused by acceleration, are detected in a push-pull fashion by fiber coils comprising the legs of a Mach-Zender optical interferometer. This sensor demonstrated an acceleration sensitivity og 2. 3 +/- 0. 1. rad g over a bandwidth of 150 - 475 Hz. The resonance frequency was q. 22 +/- 0. 05 kHz. The second accelerometer design described exploits the benefits of using a disk material having a significantly slower sound speed that aluminum, in general, a slower sound speed increases the acceleration sensitivity and decrease the resonance frequency. One polycarbonate disk with a simply supported edge condition is fastened between an <b>aluminum</b> <b>cap</b> and an aluminum housing base secured with six uniformly spaced screws. On flat fiber coil in each Mach-Zender interferometer leg was bonded to each disk surface. This sensor demonstrated an accelerometer sensitivity of 56. 0 +/- 4. 0 rad/g over a bandwidth of 30 - 950 Hz. The resonance frequency was 1. 7 +/- 0. 05 kHz.

50|$|Up {{to eight}} stories high, the {{building}} occupies {{an entire city}} block. The massively simplified facade of the bank clearly owes something to classicism. Wagner's key idea was to celebrate modern materials by developing new forms. The entire facade is covered with square marble plates.

The building's harmonious synthesis between form and functionality was highly acclaimed by critics. The metal rivets do not obstruct the facade but resemble decorative elements. The use of marble also makes the maintenance and cleaning of the facade very easy and inexpensive, another important functional element in Wagner's design. The architect kept the design very minimalistic and simple; his aim was to convey the sense of a strong, impenetrable bank in which customers would know their money was safe.|$|R
5000|$|The style {{continued}} to rise in popularity throughout the 1950s, with different manufacturers modifying the original browline design in order to compete. Art-Craft and Victory Optical introduced aluminum browlines, which replaced the plastic brows with <b>aluminum</b> <b>caps,</b> drastically decreasing the frame's weight. Shuron began modifying the original browline shape, beginning with the rectangular [...] "Rondon" [...] model, to appeal to individuals of all face shapes.

Ultimately, browline glasses accounted for half of all eyeglasses sold and worn in the 1950s. As a result, many famous figures from the mid-20th century are pictured wearing browlines, including black liberationist Malcolm X, Kentucky Fried Chicken founder Colonel Sanders, Lyndon B.

40|$|A new {{robust and}} {{exceptionally}} simple procedure for soft nano-imprint lithography (Soft-NIL) is described, which provides {{easy access to}} nanoscale patterns {{of a host of}} active materials on a Si/SiOx surface. Partial curing of a thiol-ene based UV cross-linkable resin (< 1 μm) for 30 − 40 s prior to imprinting resulted in sufficient buildup of resin molecular weight to prevent its absorption into polydimethylsiloxane molds yet maintain a low enough viscosity to allow for rapid molding of nanoscale features during the subsequent imprint-and-cure stage of the process. Imprinted features were easily transferred to the underlying substrate by traditional reactive ion etching and lift-off processes. Easy soft imprint nano-lithography (ESINL) permitted the use of untreated PDMS molds for replicating patterns in gold, nickel, and complex <b>aluminum</b> <b>capped</b> silicon structures.

40|$|Abstract: Poly(ethy 1 ene terephthalate) (PET) {{has become}} one of major post {{consumer}} plastics wastes, in addition to polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and poly(viny 1 chloride) (PVC). The challenge to large-volume plastics companies is to learn how to collect, separate, reprocess and market their low-cost products and make a profit, too. The effort of PET recycling, however, is the most successful story in the plastic recycling technology, including both reclaim and upgrade of PET waste. Beverage bottles made of PET are recycled more than 20 % of the total production. The technology of today can reclaim the post-consumer PET bottles to produce high-quality granulated PET with better than 99 % purity. A practical reclaim process for recycling PET bottles (including bottle, HDPE base cup, <b>aluminum</b> <b>cap,</b> liner, label and adhesive) is available by the Center for Plastics Recycling Research in USA. PET recycling process, like for other plastics, can be divided into three categories: incineration, physical recycling, and chemical recycling. To make the plastic recycling business pay requires more than simple recovery and marketing. Greatest profit potential is in upgraded and value-added reclaim products. Upgrading involves compounding with additives to make material more processable, adding reinforcement, or producing extrusions or finished parts from reclaim resins. For instance, a modified injection-moldable resin made from PET bottle scrap is claimed to provide high impact and processability at less cost than competitive materials. It is foreseen that chemical recycling of waste PET bottle becomes feasible if the price of raw material goes up. Three economical processes are involved in this technology: pyrolysis, hydrocracking, and hydrolysis. The hydrolysis process is presently employed to recover the raw material for unsaturated polyester resin manufacture or polyols for the production of polyurethane resin. It is reported in this presentation that polymer concrete could be a huge potential market for chemical reclaim of PET materials, especially for green or mixed-color PET, which are priced lower than colorless PET reclaim materials...|$|E
