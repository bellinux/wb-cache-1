5|$|Dan {{starts a}} {{relationship}} with Shirley Benson (Robyn Moore), telling her that his wife, Pushpa, is dead. He takes her to a wedding as his guest, but Pushpa arrives, introducing herself and exposing Dan's lie. Shirley then breaks up with him. The Ferreiras help Shirley {{to deal with her}} neighbour from hell, Gavin Sharp (Steve Nicolson), which leads to Shirley and Ash becoming close and starting a secret relationship. Shirley is unhappy that Ash refuses to tell anyone about their relationship, as he knows his father will be furious if he discovers them together. Ash reveals to Shirley that he is a compulsive gambler and he lost his house and ruined his marriage in the process; Dan had bailed him out. He says he owes his father everything <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> willing to hurt him. Dan attempts to woo Shirley again, forcing her to confess her relationship with Ash. This causes friction between the Ferreiras, and Ash breaks up with Shirley to keep the peace.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 850s and early 860s Ímar was {{involved}} in a protracted conflict with Máel Sechnaill, overking of the Southern Uí Néill and the most powerful ruler in Ireland. The cause of the conflict is uncertain, but it may have been sparked by competition for control of Munster and its resources. Ímar allied successively with Cerball, King of Osraige and Áed Findliath, overking of the Northern Uí Néill against Máel Sechnaill. Máel Sechnaill died in 862 and his lands were split, effectively ending the conflict. Following this Ímar and his kin warred with several Irish leaders in an attempt to expand their kingdom's influence. Ímar disappears from the historical record in Ireland between the years 864 and 870; this is consistent with Ímar being identical to Ivar the Boneless - Ivar was active in England between these two dates <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> mentioned by English sources after 870. In 870 the annals record that Dumbarton Rock, the chief fortress of the kingdom of Strathclyde, was successfully captured by Ímar and Amlaíb following a four-month-long siege.|$|E
5|$|In a bid {{to impress}} Martin and his colleagues, Rhys {{purchases}} a barbecue and invites them over for dinner. He is granted {{an interview with the}} surgical board to join their training program at the hospital. Following a night out with Dane Canning (Luke Pegler), Rhys gets a hangover and is horrified to learn his interview has been moved to an earlier time. Rhys struggles to answer the panel's questions <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> invited to join the program. He later visits his mother, Elaine, at her hospice, where he tells her he has joined the program. Rhys treats Chris Pappas (James Mason) after he is attacked, but fails to get him to stay for his X-rays. Aidan Foster (Bobby Morley) spots that Chris has a broken rib, which is pressing on his lung and Rhys finds him collapsed on the floor of Fitzgerald Motors. Rhys performs an emergency decompression on his lung and saves his life. Rhys asks senior surgeon Jessica Girdwood (Glenda Linscott) to reconsider letting him join the surgical program, but she declines. Rhys tries unsuccessfully to get Robbie O'Brien to quit the program and he turns his attentions to Erin Salisbury. He pretends to be romantically interested in her and tries to distract her from her studies.|$|E

25|$|Osteen has {{generally}} avoided discussing controversial {{issues such as}} gay marriage, abortion, and politics. However, when asked, Osteen {{said that he is}} opposed to same-sex marriage. Osteen refuses to preach about homosexuality due to his belief that God likes, accepts, and approves of all people. When asked if he thought God approves of homosexuality, Osteen said homosexuality is a sin according to the Scripture, but gay people are welcome in his church. He has said sin is human nature, nobody's perfect, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> judging but, God is the judge. Osteen has also stated he believes a person can be freed from a lifestyle of homosexuality; it is a process and God can free anyone of any sin or addiction. Osteen has also stressed he does not approve of homophobia, but his faith is based on his reading of the Scriptures. He has said the church has a tendency to become overly focused on single issues (such as homosexuality) to the point of neglecting others.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Henry {{arrives with}} Nico and brings it to Violet, with Sir Morgan thanking Henry {{for being a}} noble and heroic person. Unfortunately, Regina and Robin decided {{to look into the}} dreamcatcher, and {{discover}} what they see is Violet's memories: It turns out Violet discovered a note from Henry for their date, but Emma materializes and makes Violet keep a secret by taking her heart as part of her plan to free Merlin by convincing her to break Henry's heart, which leads to his tear being used. Henry sees this and is devastated by Emma's betrayal <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> alone; When Emma learns of what happened, Regina explained how she can betray Henry like that by choosing darkness over her son. Regina then warns Emma to stay away from Henry, who has also turned on Emma by closing the blinds on her before she disappears into the darkness.|$|E

The depiction of Henry's death built on an independent tradition that was once in direct competition {{with that of the}} legend, which is largely forgotten today. It remains unknown whether the two traditions were built around the same person.|$|E
500|$|A {{by-election}} is {{an election}} held in between general elections to fill a vacant parliamentary seat. Article 49 of the Constitution states that a vacancy not due to a dissolution of Parliament [...] "shall be filled by election in the manner provided by or under any law relating to the Parliamentary elections". However, when a vacancy arises in a GRC, no election needs to be held unless all the MPs have vacated their seats.

500|$|Following {{this public}} support, Boycott resumed writing for The Daily Telegraph and commentating on Channel Four for the Cheltenham and Gloucester Championship Final and the {{following}} summer's cricket. Radio Five Live then hired Boycott in early 2004. His fellow commentators state that his illness has altered his voice {{and led to a}} more pleasant personality, but that he is still prone to unpleasant behaviour. Channel Four producer Gary Francis stated [...] "I think Geoff is a lot more mellow now. He still has his moments, like when the taxi does not arrive <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> happy, as he makes extremely clear. But overall he's great fun to work with." ...|$|E

In it Nick {{knows he has}} left his needs behind; Debra Moddelmog highlights how all of the Nick storylines, {{and most of the}} others in the collection, are about a [...] "flight from pain". She believes that Gertrude Stein's definition of the Lost Generation applies to In Our Time as much, if not more so, as to The Sun Also Rises; that [...] "Nick seems to believe that the things most worth having and caring about– life, love, ideals, companions, peace, freedom– will be lost sooner or later, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> sure how to cope with this assurance, except through irony, bitterness, and, sometimes, wishful thinking." [...] In the last story he learns {{to come to terms with}} the loss of his friends, and acknowledges [...] "all the loss he has experienced in the last few years and, equally important, the loss he has come to expect." ...|$|E

500|$|Henry VI of England, son of Catherine of Valois, became titular King of France {{upon his}} {{grandfather}} Charles VI's death {{in accordance with}} the Treaty of Troyes of 1420; however this was disputed <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> always regarded as a legitimate king of France. [...] English claims to the French throne actually date from 1328, when Edward III claimed the throne after the death of Charles IV. [...] Other than Henry VI, none had ever had their claim backed by treaty, and his title became contested after 1429, when Charles VII was crowned. [...] Henry himself was crowned by a different faction in 1431, though at the age of 9, he had yet to come of age. [...] The final phase of the Hundred Years War was fought between these competing factions, resulting in a Valois victory at the Battle of Castillon in 1453, putting an end to any meaningful claims of the English monarchs over the throne of France, though English (and later British) monarchs would continue to use the title [...] "King of France" [...] until 1801.|$|E
500|$|The {{overtaking}} manoeuvres made by Coulthard on Michael Schumacher {{received much}} media attention after the race. Coulthard accused Michael Schumacher of unsporting behaviour and dangerous driving, saying: [...] "I had a clean run at Michael {{on the outside}} and equally I felt he drove me wide. You could say he had the right to do that because he had the track position, but I think it was a deliberate gesture in trying to run someone wide like that and I was very angry." [...] Michael Schumacher later denied any wrongdoing and citied a similar incident at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix where Coulthard pushed him wide although no objections were made. He also admitted that he did not see Coulthard's hand gesture. Coulthard sought clarification with the FIA over such overtakes with a source from Formula One's governing body noting: [...] "It was hard racing -- they are racing drivers aren't they?" [...] GrandPrix.com said that Coulthard's overtake meant that [...] "He is ready to stand up to Michael <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> afraid of what will happen if Michael does not lift." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan Litsey {{described}} the Joker {{as an example}} of a [...] "Nietzschean Superman", arguing that a fundamental aspect of Friedrich Nietzsche's Superman, the [...] "will to power", is exemplified in all of the Joker's actions, providing a master morality to Batman's slave morality. The character's indomitable [...] "will to power" [...] means he is never discouraged by being caught or defeated <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> restrained by guilt or remorse. Joker represents the master, who creates rules and defines them, who judges others without needing approval, and for whom something is good because it benefits him. He creates his own morality and is bound only by his own rules without aspiring to something higher than himself, unlike Batman, the slave, who makes a distinction between good and evil, and is bound to rules outside of himself (such as his avoidance of killing), in his quest for justice. The Joker has no defined origin story that requires him to question how he came to be, as like the Superman he does not regret or assess the past and only moves forward.|$|E
