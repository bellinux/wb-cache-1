40|$|This {{handbook}} {{has been}} {{prepared by the}} faculty (appendix 1) of the “Regional Studies Course ” (RSC) to support a program of study that prepares Army officers for Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations <b>assignments</b> <b>abroad.</b> In the course, students survey five world “regions ” [...] Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East [...] and study {{one of them in}} some depth. The faculty uses the sixteen discrete “Political-Military Factors ” discussed herein as common reference points for teaching the course's five regionally focused seminars.

Furthermore, the framework provides the start point for specific analyses of associated operational issues, questions, and problems. The theories, concepts, and insights developed in-conjunction with these sixteen factors are drawn from broadly accepted scholarship; but they are selected, organized, and presented to support the course's practical goal of preparing officers for challenging Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations <b>assignments</b> <b>abroad.</b> We welcome your comments, ideas, and critiques.
