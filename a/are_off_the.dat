5|$|Animals {{will use}} {{different}} gaits for different speeds, terrain and situations. For example, horses show four natural gaits, the slowest horse gait is the walk, {{then there are}} three faster gaits which, from slowest to fastest, are the trot, the canter and the gallop. Animals may also have unusual gaits that are used occasionally, such as for moving sideways or backwards. For example, the main human gaits are bipedal walking and running, but they employ many other gaits occasionally, including a four-legged crawl in tight spaces. Mammals show a vast range of gaits, the order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion. Gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence. For quadrupeds, there are three main categories: walking gaits, running gaits and leaping gaits. Walking {{is the most common}} gait, where some feet are on the ground at any given time, and found in almost all legged animals. Running is considered to occur when at some points in the stride all feet <b>are</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ground in a moment of suspension.|$|E

25|$|When {{a player}} leaves the ground due to injury and is {{replaced}} by a substitute fielder, he/she is generally not permitted to return and immediately resume bowling (or batting if their team's innings commences while they <b>are</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> field). The injured player is required to spend a period back on the field at least equal to the time that they were absent before resuming bowling. Variations of the time periods required and the circumstances of the players return to the field apply in different forms of the game.|$|E
25|$|Like a canter, {{the horse}} will strike off with its non-leading hind foot; {{but the second}} stage of the canter becomes, in the gallop, the second and third stages because the inside hind foot hits the ground a split second before the outside front foot. Then both gaits end with the {{striking}} off of the leading leg, followed by a moment of suspension when all four feet <b>are</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ground. A careful listener or observer can tell an extended canter from a gallop by the presence of the fourth beat.|$|E

25|$|There is an {{abandoned}} donkey engine {{in the forest}} near {{the west bank of}} the Clearwater River at Marcus Falls. It can be seen from the viewpoint in late fall when leaves <b>are</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> trees, but otherwise it is not accessible. It was moved here in the winter of 1912-13 when the Canadian Northern Railway was being planned and some loggers figured they could get the contract for the Clearwater River bridge at Bailey's Chute if they had a donkey on site. The 10-ton machine was skidded over the ice of Canim Lake, rafted along Mahood Lake in the spring, then winched to this location. The men had already cut 9000 cubic meters of timber when the railway was confirmed along a different route.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the strong}} {{prevailing}} winds, and shallow water, countries on the North Sea, particularly Germany and Denmark, have used the shore for wind power since the 1990s. The North Sea {{is the home of}} one of the first large-scale offshore wind farms in the world, Horns Rev 1, completed in 2002. Since then many other wind farms have been commissioned in the North Sea (and elsewhere).
