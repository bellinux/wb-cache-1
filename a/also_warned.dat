5|$|After {{tracking}} eastward {{across the}} Philippines, Linfa reorganized and curved northeastward toward Japan. The Japan Meteorological Agency anticipated heavy precipitation and strong winds {{in the island}} nation's southwestern regions. The agency <b>also</b> <b>warned</b> residents in low-lying areas of potential flooding. The JMA indicated the heightened possibility of landslides in the Tōhoku region due to a recent earthquake in the area. Due to the forecasted impacts and track, as many as 102domestic flights were cancelled in a single day, particularly those associated with southwestern Japan. In addition, five ferry services were cancelled. Upon making landfall on Shikoku, Linfa became the first tropical cyclone since 1965 to strike Japan during May, {{as well as the}} third earliest tropical cyclone to make landfall on any of Japan's four main islands since standardized records began in 1951.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of his regency, Pedro promulgated decrees that {{guaranteed}} personal and property rights. He also reduced government expenditure and taxes. Even the revolutionaries arrested in the Merchants' Exchange incident were set free. On 5 June 1821, army troops under Portuguese lieutenant general Jorge Avilez (later Count of Avilez) mutinied, demanding that Pedro should take an oath to uphold the Portuguese Constitution after it was enacted. The prince rode out alone to intervene with the mutineers. He calmly and resourcefully negotiated, winning {{the respect of the}} troops and succeeding in reducing the impact of their more unacceptable demands. The mutiny was a thinly veiled military coup d'état that sought to turn Pedro into a mere figurehead and transfer power to Avilez. The prince accepted the unsatisfactory outcome, but he <b>also</b> <b>warned</b> that {{it was the last time}} he would yield under pressure.|$|E
5|$|Officials in Oaxaca {{shut down}} beaches and warned {{people not to}} venture out into the water. Residents were advised of {{potentially}} heavy rainfall.

Upon Rick's intensification to a Category4 hurricane, officials in Mexico raised the alert level in Guerrero, Jalisco and Michoacán to severe.

5|$|On 18 August, Porto Alegre {{received}} {{instructions from}} Mitre {{to attack the}} Paraguayan fort at Curuzú. The operation would be carried out {{under the command of}} Tamandaré. Porto Alegre not only refused to defer to his cousin, arguing that both held the same rank, but <b>also</b> <b>warned</b> that he would operate by himself at Curuzú. Porto Alegre was incapable of submitting his forces to foreign direction and was unwilling to comply with orders issued by the allied commander. Nor was the situation among the allied forces improved once Porto Alegre and Tamandaré found common ground in their distaste for the Brazilian commander of the 1st Corps, Field Marshal Polidoro Quintanilha Jordão (later the Viscount of Santa Teresa). Jordão was ostracized for supporting Mitre and for {{being a member of the}} Conservative Party, while Porto Alegre and Tamandaré were Progressives.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the storm in India, {{government}} officials there issued a severe storm warning for Thoothukudi District, and <b>also</b> <b>warned</b> fishermen not to go out to sea. Thousands were evacuated to emergency shelters prior to the storm's arrival. The cyclone produced rough surf along the southern Indian coast, and heavy rainfall in and around Thoothukudi, causing flooding in a few low-lying areas. The rainfall caused some damage to banana crops, uprooted several trees, and left some roads impassable, but was largely beneficial in alleviating drought conditions. Across southern India, the cyclone damaged 749houses and destroyed 81more, but no deaths were reported in the country.|$|E
5|$|The 1996–97 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone {{season was}} the longest on record, with both an unusually early start and unusually late ending.

There were 12named storms, beginning with Antoinette and proceeding sequentially until Lisette. In addition, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center <b>also</b> <b>warned</b> on storms in the region, which identified five other tropical storms. Five of the storms attained tropical cyclone status, or with 10minute maximum sustained winds of at least 120km/h (75mph); of these, three strengthened further into intense tropical cyclones, with Daniella and Helinda tied for strongest storm of the season.|$|E

5|$|As the {{hurricane}} traversed the Central Atlantic, the United States Weather Bureau {{indicated that the}} storm {{would not be a}} threat to continental land masses due to its isolated position. However, ships in the storm's vicinity and to the northwest of {{the hurricane}} were advised caution. Other shipping lanes in the forecast path of the hurricane were <b>also</b> <b>warned.</b> After recurving in the direction of Bermuda, the British overseas colony was advised to begin prompt precautionary measures against storm surge and strong winds, which were expected from the hurricane. Aircraft from the United States Air Force and Navy stationed in Bermuda were sent to airfields in the United States to avoid the hurricane, while a Navy task force of twelve ships including the escort carrier USS Mindoro (CVE-120) were dispatched from the island. The U.S. naval operating base moved boats from exposed areas into safer parts of the base. Similar precautionary measures were undertaken by the British naval operating base.|$|E
5|$|For 11 {{hours the}} German fleet sailed from Brest into the English Channel to the Dover Straits. By chance, a {{mechanic}} {{on the radar}} station at Fairlight, East Sussex had just finished repairing the equipment when he picked up 27 echos at 10:15 on 12 February, south of Cap Gris Nez. The information was relayed to Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay, who ordered his Air Officer liaison to contact No. 11 Group RAF to ask for armed reconnaissance. Ramsay <b>also</b> <b>warned</b> No. 16 Group RAF and the FAA squadron operating out of RAF Manston that there were possible targets were in the Channel, despite not knowing the exact number or size of the enemy vessels. The performance of the radar was down to the jamming of the sets (Ballstöranlage) by two Heinkel He 111s which had been flying off the south coast from their airfield near Paris. The flights ceased at 09:00 when installations along the French coast had taken over. The detection by Fairlight {{was a piece of}} good fortune, the Germans had assumed it to be out of action. Ten Dornier Do 217s from III./KG 2 flew missions against Plymouth harbour and airfield, while 15 flew diversion missions to keep RAF fighters clear of the He 111s.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944, the {{battalion}} was alerted to begin preparations for operations in Borneo {{as part of}} the Borneo campaign. As well as preparing for airborne operations, {{the battalion}} also conducted amphibious training in late January and early February 1945 as part of a possible role in the amphibious landing at Balikpapan. The battalion was not used in this operation, however, due to a shortage of suitable aircraft. A few months later, the battalion was <b>also</b> <b>warned</b> to prepare for a mission to rescue thousands of Allied prisoners held by the Japanese at Sandakan in North Borneo. This operation, codenamed Operation Kingfisher, was controversially also cancelled {{due to a lack of}} aircraft, and the prisoners were subsequently killed by the Japanese in what subsequently became known as the Sandakan Death Marches. The disappointment of not being deployed to Borneo caused significant frustration within the battalion, with many soldiers requesting transfers to other infantry units such as Z Special Unit. Many of these requests were denied, however, as the battalion had been instructed to prepare to operate alongside British paratroopers in the planned liberation of Singapore that was to have taken place later in 1945 as part of Operations Zipper and Mailfist.|$|E
