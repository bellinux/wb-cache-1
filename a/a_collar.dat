5|$|The unit {{insignia}} was a stylised Týr rune with arrows {{pointing to}} the left and right. <b>A</b> <b>collar</b> insignia was manufactured, but it is believed that these were never issued or worn, {{and the members of the}} division wore the standard SS Sig runes.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, Roy McBride, {{a farmer}} from Alpine, Texas, invented <b>a</b> <b>collar</b> {{filled with the}} poison {{compound}} 1080 to protect his livestock from coyotes, which tended to attack the throat. This device {{is known as the}} livestock protection collar and is in widespread use in Texas, as well as in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Grave {{artifacts}} from dirt domes excavated in the 1980s along the Illinois River revealed a complete {{skeleton of a}} young bobcat along with <b>a</b> <b>collar</b> made of bone pendants and shell beads that had been buried by the Hopewell culture. The type and place of burial indicate a tamed and cherished pet or possible spiritual significance. The Hopewell normally buried their dogs, so the bones were initially identified as remains of a puppy, but dogs were usually buried close to the village {{and not in the}} mounts themselves. This is the only wild cat decorated burial on the archaeological record.|$|E

5|$|On {{the same}} day of his Alfreton release, Mackin signed for his {{hometown}} club Chester, joining the Northern Premier League Premier Division club on a contract {{until the end of}} 2011–12. Chester had been interested in signing him in the summer but he had opted to remain in full-time football with Alfreton. He scored on his debut with the final goal of a 4–0 victory over Rushall Olympic on 7 January 2011, having entered the match as a 73rd-minute substitute. He finished the season with one goal in six appearances having sustained <b>a</b> <b>collar</b> bone injury in his first start.|$|E
5|$|The Castaing {{machine is}} a device used to add {{lettering}} and decoration {{to the edge}} of a coin. Such lettering was necessitated by counterfeiting and edge clipping, which was a common problem resulting from the uneven and irregular hammered coinage. When Aubin Olivier introduced milled coinage to France, he also developed a method of marking the edges with lettering which would make it possible to detect if metal had been shaved from the edge. This method involved using <b>a</b> <b>collar,</b> into which the metal flowed from the pressure of the press. This technique was slower and more costly than later methods. France abandoned milled coinage in favour of hammering in 1585.|$|E
5|$|The College, {{like the}} Church of All Saints, is {{constructed}} of Kentish rag-stone in the Perpendicular style. The main building, a two-storey structure with attic, was mostly {{built in the}} 14th century and served originally as the Master's house. Some later 18th century alterations have been made and later windows added. The building contains <b>a</b> <b>collar</b> beam roof and a 16th-century staircase, moulded ceiling and aumbry cupboard. Poste records in his 1847 history of the College {{that some of the}} rooms retained traces of decorative wall painting.|$|E
50|$|Outside these situations, {{detachable}} collars {{are less}} common. Stiff collars {{in particular with}} daywear {{in the 21st century}} are generally rare, but if one is worn, it is usually <b>a</b> turndown <b>collar,</b> though morning dress is seen still with <b>a</b> wing <b>collar.</b> Older styles, such as the imperial <b>collar</b> (<b>a</b> high <b>collar</b> with no wings last popular with the Edwardians), are not frequently seen now. A more common use of detachable collars is with eveningwear, in which case <b>a</b> high wing <b>collar</b> is worn in America although turn-down collars are preferred for black-tie in Britain as per Edward VII.|$|R
25|$|Shirts {{designed}} to take <b>a</b> detachable <b>collar</b> have <b>a</b> tunic <b>collar,</b> which is <b>a</b> low standing band of fabric around the neck, with a hole at {{the front and back}} for the collar studs.|$|R
5000|$|Detachable collars {{are often}} used by barristers in the UK, Ireland and Canada, many of whom wear <b>a</b> winged <b>collar</b> when in court to allow the use of bands. On the way to and from court, <b>a</b> {{turndown}} <b>collar</b> and tie is worn. Another common use of detachable <b>collars</b> now is <b>a</b> clerical <b>collar</b> (or [...] "Roman Collar"), though these are now often made from flexible plastic for ease of washing, and are not always now attached in the traditional way with studs. Also, at Eton College, all pupils wear stiff collars, mostly turndown collars, while students in positions of authority wear 'stick-ups', which includes <b>a</b> wing <b>collar.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Roundels Argent {{charged with}} a Cross Gules (white circles with a red cross) allude to the badge of office of Rouge Croix. Planché used his coat of arms on his bookplate, and the crest alone on his writing paper. When he was {{promoted}} to Somerset Herald, Planché surrounded the crest on his writing paper with <b>a</b> <b>collar</b> of Esses. While he was entitled to the collar by his appointment as herald, its inclusion in his armorial bearings was considered somewhat unusual.|$|E
5|$|From Europe, {{the legend}} {{maintains}} that the returning crusaders brought the Saluki back from the Middle East. The painting of Henry IV, Duke of Saxony with his hunting dog, painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder in 1514, is thought by some to show a Saluki. The dog wears <b>a</b> <b>collar</b> decorated with a scallop shell, which is the badge of a pilgrim who has traveled the Way of Saint James in Spain. Salukis appear in Paolo Veronese's 1573 work The Adoration of the Magi (also known as the Adoration of the Kings), currently located at the National Gallery, London. Veronese painted the breed in another two of his religious paintings: The Marriage at Cana and The Finding of Moses.|$|E
5|$|Immature fruit {{bodies are}} spherical—somewhat {{resembling}} puffballs with pointed beaks—and are partially or completely {{buried in the}} ground. As the fungus matures, the outer layer of tissue (the exoperidium) splits into four to eight pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards, lifting and exposing the spherical inner spore sac. The spore sac contains the gleba, a mass of spores and fertile mycelial tissue that when young is white and firm, but ages to become brown and powdery. Often, a layer of the exoperidium splits {{around the perimeter of}} the spore sac so that it appears to rest in <b>a</b> <b>collar</b> or saucer. Atop the spore sac is a small pointed beak, the peristome, which has a small hole from which spores may be released.|$|E

5000|$|Officers {{and certain}} senior NCOs {{had the option}} of wearing a white cotton tunic from April through September. The Reichswehr [...] "old-style" [...] (ältere Art) model had <b>a</b> stand <b>collar,</b> <b>a</b> six-button front, and plain sleeves; it was {{authorized}} for barracks wear, supervising training, and attending sporting events. The newer model introduced in 1937 had <b>a</b> rise-and-fall <b>collar,</b> <b>an</b> eight-button front, and French cuffs, and was authorized as a summer walking-out and undress uniform. Both versions had removable buttons, shoulderboards and metal breast eagle in order to permit laundering; collar insignia was not worn.|$|R
5|$|In his 1821 A Natural Arrangement of British Plants, Samuel Frederick Gray {{introduced}} the generic name Micromphale, including the species Micromphale collariatum, {{which was based}} on William Withering's 1796 Merulius collariatus. In 1946 Alexander H. Smith and Rolf Singer proposed to conserve the name Marasmius over Micromphale; the latter had nomenclatorial priority as it was published first. The generic name Marasmius, with M.rotula as the lectotype species, was later conserved at the 1954 Paris Congress on Botanical Nomenclature. M.rotula is also the type species of section Marasmius within the genus. This grouping of species is characterized by inamyloid flesh, a cap cuticle with broom cells (finger-like projections common to Marasmius species) ornamented with numerous warts, gills usually attached to <b>a</b> <b>collar</b> surrounding the stem, and the presence of black rhizomorphs on the stem.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah {{has a very}} {{localised}} distribution, being {{restricted to}} Mount Kinabalu and neighbouring Mount Tambuyukon, both located in Kinabalu National Park, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Mount Kinabalu is a massive granitic dome structure that is geologically young and formed from the intrusion and uplift of a granitic batholith. At 4095.2m, it {{is by far the}} tallest mountain on the island of Borneo and one of the highest peaks in Southeast Asia. The lower slopes of the mountain are mainly composed of sandstone and shale, transformed from marine sand and mud about 35 million years ago. Intrusive ultramafic (serpentine) rock was uplifted with the core of the batholith and forms <b>a</b> <b>collar</b> around the mountain. It is on these ultramafic soils that the flora of Mount Kinabalu exhibits the greatest levels of endemicity and many of the area's rarest species can be found here.|$|E
5|$|The George III Fringe Tiara is a circlet {{incorporating}} brilliant diamonds {{that were}} formerly owned by George III. Originally commissioned in 1830, the tiara has been worn by many queens consort. Originally, {{it could be}} worn as <b>a</b> <b>collar</b> or necklace or mounted on a wire to form the tiara. Queen Victoria wore it as a tiara {{during a visit to}} the Royal Opera in 1839. In Franz Xaver Winterhalter's painting The First of May, completed in 1851, Victoria can be seen wearing it as she holds Prince Arthur, the future Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. In a veiled reference to the adoration of the Magi, the Duke of Wellington is seen presenting the young prince with a gift.|$|E

5|$|The division's {{identification}} symbol was the Albanian double-headed eagle. Despite its short existence, <b>a</b> <b>collar</b> patch depicting a goat-crested helmet was manufactured for the division {{but there is}} no evidence that it was ever used. Photographs exist of a machined-woven cuff band with the title Skanderbeg, but this was awarded to the 14th SS Volunteer Gebirgsjäger Regiment of the 7th SS Division in autumn 1944, and not to this division. Members of the cadre staff were photographed wearing an Albanian arm shield depicting a black Albanian double-headed eagle on a red field. Many of the division's Muslim members wore traditional grey-coloured skull caps instead of the standard SS field cap. Others wore the traditional Albanian highlander hat, the Qeleshe.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} {{familiar with}} their new shadows, the party travels to Talta village, befriending Marumaro on the way, who also possesses a magical shadow. Finding that the villagers from Talta have started to head towards {{the capital city of}} Jibral, the party takes off after them. Just outside Jibral, the party finds the villagers attacked by Steel-Eating Tigers. They are saved by the arrival of King Jibral and his forces, including Zola. Once the villagers are brought to Jibral, the King decides to implement a plan to destroy one of Nene's bases near Jibral using Shu and his friends along with Zola. Together, the party works with the warriors of Talta Village the Jibral Kingdom to besiege Nene's Mechat base. After the base is destroyed, the party heads north in search of Nene. Nene captures Kluke, and places <b>a</b> <b>collar</b> around her neck which Nene alleges will explode. After reaching Nene, Zola separates from the party to buy them time to attack Nene. When the party attempts to remove Kluke's collar, Nene absorbs the party's shadows by placing collars on all of them. After taking their powers and placing them in himself, he removes their collars and attempts to kill them before they recover. Shu, despite being drained of magical ability, unconsciously teleports the party to the distant Devour village.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{interpretation of}} potbelly monuments {{is that they}} were representations of rulership. This is suggested by the body position represented in the sculptures, the type of adornment sometimes depicted on them, the pedestals on which they sometimes sit and the ceremonial sites where they are found as well as their locations within such sites. The potbelly body position is symbolic of rulership; the figures are seated cross-legged and with the arms wrapping the body or holding an object. Twenty-five potbelly monuments are known to display <b>a</b> <b>collar</b> as neck jewellery, again suggestive of rulership. Pedestal bases are known from potbelly sculptures from Sin Cabezas, Antigua Guatemala, Kaminaljuyu, Santa Cruz del Quiché, Takalik Abaj, Tikal, Ujuxte, El Balsamo, Los Cerritos and La Nueva in Guatemala, Chalchuapa in El Salvador, and Copán in Honduras. This represents 42% of sites with potbelly sculptures. If pedestals are equivalent to thrones then Bilbao Monument 58 is also relevant, which was found associated with a four-legged stone altar or throne and may originally have been positioned on top of it.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{swearing}} in as Lord Protector in 1653, Oliver Cromwell {{became a}} proponent of Blondeau's coinage method, which had yet to find favour in the nation's minting establishment. In 1654, Cromwell's government placed Blondeau {{in charge of a}} planned mint in Ireland, where the coinage was heavily debased by fraudulent means. The proposed mint never came into existence, but in 1656, Blondeau was given official appointment to strike £2,000 worth of coins bearing Cromwell's portrait with captured Spanish silver. The former Royal Mint superintendent, William John Hocking, believed that the edge lettering on Blondeau's coinage was created by means of a perforated steel strip, through which the coin's metal flowed during striking, creating the raised designs and wording. Hocking suggested that this technique would have been less costly than the older method involving the split collar, because the steel strip could be replaced more economically. However, the numismatist Peter B. Gaspar determined that Blondeau's Cromwell-era coinage was struck without <b>a</b> <b>collar,</b> which suggests that he used a machine to impart the edge lettering prior to striking.|$|E
5|$|The Erpingham Gate is {{the primary}} {{entrance}} to the north section of the Close, directly opposite the west door of the cathedral. It was commissioned by Sir Thomas Erpingham, a commander in the Battle of Agincourt and was constructed between 1416 and 1425. The top of the arch contains a canopied niche which is thought originally to have been dedicated to the Five Holy Wounds of Christ, flanked by the Four Evangelists and with the Holy Trinity above, but was replaced in the 18th century with a kneeling statue of Erpingham wearing armour and surcoat with <b>a</b> <b>collar</b> of Esses and the Order of the Garter below his left knee. The rest of the gateway is decorated with the coat of arms of Erpingham and members of his family, together with his motto yenk (think) on small scrolls. It has been restored several times: first in the 18th century, then by E. W. Tristram in 1938 and again by Feilden and Mawson in 1989. It is a scheduled monument and adjoins School House and the Music School, which occupy 70 and 71 The Close respectively.|$|E
25|$|During a heraldic {{revision}} in 1944, {{the office}} of the Swedish Herald of the Realm (Riksheraldikerämbetet) discovered that a mistake had been committed. It was then decided the Öland deer should have <b>a</b> <b>collar,</b> something which had sometimes occurred before and had been considered for Djurgården. So in 1944 the arms of Öland were reverted to the single golden red deer, which at this time was granted the distinction of <b>a</b> <b>collar,</b> marking it as the royal game.|$|E
