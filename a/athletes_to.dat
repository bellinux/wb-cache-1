5|$|However, another {{obstacle}} arose {{with the}} Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in}} a boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western World, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the <b>athletes</b> <b>to</b> boycott the Games. Tonelli, however, realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the <b>athletes</b> <b>to</b> fight for their right to compete.|$|E

5|$|In early 1942, {{with the}} United States now embroiled World War II, Arthur Compton {{concentrated}} the Manhattan Project's various teams working on plutonium at the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. Zinn used <b>athletes</b> <b>to</b> build Fermi's increasingly large experimental configurations under the stands of the disused Stagg Field. In July 1942, Fermi measured a k = 1.007 from a uranium oxide lattice. This raised hopes that pure uranium would yield a suitable value of k.|$|E

However, current research and recommendations by professional organizations including the National Athletic Trainers' Association recommend against such use of these grading systems. Currently, injured athletes are prohibited from returning to play before they are symptom-free during both rest and exertion and until results of the neuropsychological tests have returned to pre-injury levels.|$|E

5|$|Many of Canada's {{top players}} were NHL {{professional}}s, so the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) {{pushed for the}} ability to use professional and amateur players. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to allow all <b>athletes</b> <b>to</b> compete in Olympic Games held after 1988. The NHL was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because the Olympics are held {{in the middle of the}} NHL season. An agreement was later reached and NHL players began competing in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in 1952, {{when the}} {{mainland}} NOC (the All-China Athletic Federation), considering itself a continuation of the pre-1949 committee, wrote to the IOC stating that it desired to participate in the Helsinki Olympics to be held that year. As the Taiwanese also proposed to send a team, this conflicted with IOC rules stating that only one committee could represent a country, and both Chinese groups were unwilling to negotiate with the other, or to send a joint team. After considerable deliberation, the IOC decided that if either committee was recognized by the ISF for a sport, the committee could send <b>athletes</b> <b>to</b> participate in events in that discipline. In protest, Taiwan withdrew from the Games; the PRC sent a team to Helsinki, though it arrived ten days after the start of the Games. Brundage, president-elect when {{the decision was made to}} allow PRC <b>athletes</b> <b>to</b> compete, argued against the decision to allow mainland participation before its NOC was recognized, but he was overruled by his colleagues.|$|E
