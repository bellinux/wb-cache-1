5|$|Draught {{beer from}} a {{pressurised}} keg using a lever-style dispenser and <b>a</b> <b>spout</b> {{is the most}} common method of dispensing in bars around the world. A metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide (CO2) gas which drives the beer to the dispensing tap or faucet. Some beers may be served with a nitrogen/carbon dioxide mixture. Nitrogen produces fine bubbles, resulting in a dense head and a creamy mouthfeel. Some types of beer can also be found in smaller, disposable kegs called beer balls. In traditional pubs, the pull levers for major beer brands may include the beer's logo and trademark.|$|E

40|$|Coating of {{particles}} {{larger than about}} 1 mm can be achieved in <b>a</b> <b>spouted</b> bed, <b>a</b> particle mobilization device in which a strong particle circulation occurs, rapidly upwards in a lean central "spout" region and downwards in a slowly moving annular settled bed. In <b>a</b> <b>spouted</b> bed coater, <b>a</b> spray nozzle is placed {{at the base of}} the spout, spraying upwards into a distinct coating zone. The coating formation in <b>a</b> <b>spouted</b> bed is inter alia a function of (i) the particle motion, that is, how often and where particles enter and traverse the coating zone and (ii) the extent of droplet collection by individual particles passing through the coating zone. The coating model proposed here is based on the statistical history of individual particles, whose projected area governs the collection of spray droplets in the coating zone. Positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) has been used to determine the particle trajectories, the distribution of cycle times and the size and voidage of the spout. Whilst the model is not capable of delivering absolute values of coating mass a priori, it can predict deviations from a mean, which can itself be determined from an overall mass balance. To validate the model, <b>a</b> <b>spouted</b> bed coating process was studied in which coarse PVC spheres were coated with the hot-melt coating material polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1500. Coating mass distributions, derived from the weight data of individual particles before and after manual coating removal, compared (for the studied conditions) very well with the predictions of the model. ...|$|R

The results obtained from the TGA measurements, the kinetic methodology based on the combination of the iso-conversional methods Friedman, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose, Vyazovkin and the use of Master Plots assessed by Perez-Maqueda criterion have permitted to describe mathematically both thermo-chemical reactions.

500|$|The air {{commander}} aboard Ark Royal—aware {{that the}} surviving Dorniers would report {{the location of}} the British ships—ordered the aircraft to be secured and the anti-aircraft weapons readied. Four Junkers Ju 88 bombers of the Luftwaffe bomber wing KG 30 soon appeared: three were driven away by anti-aircraft fire, but the fourth launched a [...] bomb at the carrier. Ark Royal turned hard to starboard, heeling over and avoiding the bomb, which landed in the ocean [...] off her starboard bow and sent <b>a</b> <b>spout</b> of water over the ship. The German pilots did not see if the carrier had been hit, and a reconnaissance flight later located the two battleships, but not Ark Royal. Based on this information, the Germans incorrectly claimed that Ark Royal had sunk. To prove the German propaganda false before it had a negative effect on Britain's allies, Winston Churchill personally reassured United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt that the carrier was undamaged and invited the US naval attaché to view Ark Royal in dock. The British naval attaché in Rome was instructed to assure Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini that the ship was still in service. This was an embarrassment for Goebbels and Nazi propaganda.|$|E
500|$|The Malvern Spa Association (MSA) is a {{non-profit}} organisation, founded in September 1998, with two primary aims. [...] "To conserve, protect {{and restore the}} Springs, Wells, Spouts and Fountains of the Malvern Hills", and [...] "to promote the study, conservation, development and awareness" [...] of them, and of [...] "Great Malvern as a Spa Town". Apart from various fundraising activities and membership fees, the MSA receives funding through the Heritage Lottery Fund, which is managed by the Malvern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Unit (Malvern Hills AONB), {{under the umbrella of}} the National Association for Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (NAAONB). The Malvern Hills AONB also provides grants via such mechanisms as the Sustainable Development Fund. The MSA was founded by the Spa Water Strategy Working Group, comprising Malvern town councillors and artist Rose Garrard. Its patrons are Lord and Lady Sandys, after whose family <b>a</b> <b>spout</b> located in Spring Lane, Malvern Link is named, and which was restored in 2005 as part of the Malvern heritage Project. In 2004, in order to finance improvements and restoration to 20 historical sites, a grant of £270,000 was awarded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The MSA produces a free newsletter available at the Tourist Information Centre in Great Malvern, at St Ann's Well and for download.|$|E

2500|$|To {{cure the}} disease, it is {{necessary}} to produce <b>a</b> <b>spout</b> of smoke by burning off thirty-six charms, and instruct the patient to inhale and to swallow up its fumes, whether he likes it or not. By the time all charms are used up, the smoke should also be dispersed. It may be difficult for the patient to bear the odour of the smoke at first, but once he gets used to such a smell, it does not really matter. Whenever the patient feels that there is phlegm in his throat, he is advised to cough and spit it out. If the patient is greatly affected by the symptoms, it will be good if his spittle is thick and if he can spit it out. When the patient is less affected by the wicked ch'i, he does not have much phlegm to eject, but if he is deeply affected, he tends to vomit and to expectorate heavily until everything is cleared up, and then his illness is cured.
