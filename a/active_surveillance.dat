25|$|Many men {{diagnosed}} with low-risk prostate cancer {{are eligible for}} <b>active</b> <b>surveillance.</b> This term implies careful observation of the tumor over time, {{with the intention of}} treatment for a cure if there are signs of cancer progression. <b>Active</b> <b>surveillance</b> is not synonymous with watchful waiting, an older term which implies no treatment or specific program of monitoring, with the assumption that palliative, not curative, treatment would be used if advanced, symptomatic disease develops.|$|E
25|$|<b>Active</b> <b>surveillance</b> is {{observation}} and regular monitoring without invasive treatment. In {{the context of}} prostate disease this usually comprises regular PSA blood tests and prostate biopsies. <b>Active</b> <b>surveillance</b> is often used when an early stage, slow-growing prostate cancer is suspected. However, watchful waiting may also be suggested when the risks of surgery, radiation therapy, or hormonal therapy outweigh the possible benefits. Other treatments can be started if symptoms develop, or if {{there are signs that}} the cancer growth is accelerating (e.g., rapidly rising PSA, increase in Gleason score on repeat biopsy, etc.).|$|E
40|$|IntroductionThe Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) {{implemented}} an <b>active</b> mortality <b>surveillance</b> {{system to}} enumerate and characterize hurricane-related deaths during Hurricane Ike in 2008. This surveillance system used established guidelines and case definitions to categorize deaths as directly, indirectly, and possibly related to Hurricane Ike. ObjectiveThe {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate Texas DSHS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 <b>active</b> mortality <b>surveillance</b> system using US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s (CDC) surveillance system evaluation guidelines. MethodsUsing CDC 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s Updated Guidelines for Surveillance System Evaluation, the <b>active</b> mortality <b>surveillance</b> system of the Texas DSHS was evaluated. Data from the <b>active</b> mortality <b>surveillance</b> system were compared with Texas vital statistics data for the same time period to estimate the completeness of reported disaster-related deaths. ResultsFrom September 8 through October 13, 2008, medical examiners (MEs) and Justices of the Peace (JPs) in 44 affected counties reported deaths daily by using a one-page, standardized mortality form. The <b>active</b> mortality <b>surveillance</b> system identified 74 hurricane-related deaths, whereas a review of vital statistics data revealed only four deaths that were hurricane-related. The average time of reporting a death by <b>active</b> mortality <b>surveillance</b> and vital statistics was 14 days and 16 days, respectively. ConclusionsTexas 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s <b>active</b> mortality <b>surveillance</b> system successfully identified hurricane-related deaths. Evaluation of the <b>active</b> mortality <b>surveillance</b> system suggested that it is necessary to collect detailed and representative mortality data during a hurricane because vital statistics do not capture sufficient information to identify whether deaths are hurricane-related. The results from this evaluation will help improve <b>active</b> mortality <b>surveillance</b> during hurricanes which, in turn, will enhance preparedness and response plans and identify public health interventions to reduce future hurricane-related mortality rates.

25|$|Approximately {{one-third of}} men who choose <b>active</b> <b>surveillance</b> for early stage tumors {{eventually}} have signs of tumor progression, and they may need to begin treatment within three years. Men that choose <b>active</b> <b>surveillance</b> avoid the risks of surgery, radiation, and other treatments. The risk of disease progression and metastasis (spread of the cancer) may be increased, but this increase risk appears to be small if the program of surveillance is followed closely, generally including serial PSA assessments and repeat prostate biopsies every 1–2 years depending on the PSA trends.|$|E
25|$|Public Health {{surveillance}} {{systems can}} be passive or active. A passive surveillance system consists of the regular, ongoing reporting of diseases and conditions by all health facilities in a given territory. An <b>active</b> <b>surveillance</b> system is one where health facilities are visited and health care providers and medical records are reviewed {{in order to identify}} a specific disease or condition. Passive surveillance systems are less time consuming and less expensive to run but risk under-reporting of some diseases. <b>Active</b> <b>surveillance</b> systems are most appropriate for epidemics or where a disease has been targeted for elimination.|$|E

25|$|Tsetse flies {{transmit}} {{a similar}} disease to humans, called African trypanosomiasis - human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness. An estimated 70 {{million people in}} 20 countries are {{at different levels of}} risk and only 3-4 million people are covered by <b>active</b> <b>surveillance.</b> The DALY index (disability-adjusted life years), an indicator to quantify the burden of disease, includes the impact of both the duration of life lost due to premature death and the duration of life lived with a disability. The annual burden of sleeping sickness is estimated at 2 million DALYs. Since the disease tends to affect economically active adults, the total cost to a family with a patient is about 25% of a year’s income.|$|E
25|$|<b>Active</b> <b>surveillance</b> {{involves}} {{monitoring the}} tumor {{for signs of}} growth or the appearance of symptoms. The monitoring process may involve serial PSA, physical examination of the prostate, and/or repeated biopsies. The goal of surveillance is to avoid overtreatment and the sometimes serious, permanent side effects of treatment for a slow-growing or self-limited tumor that would never cause any problems for the person. This approach is not used for aggressive cancers, but it may cause anxiety for people who wrongly believe that all cancer is deadly or themselves to have life-threatening cancer. For 50% to 75% of people with prostate cancer it will cause no harm before a person dies from other causes.|$|E
25|$|Regular <b>active</b> <b>surveillance,</b> {{involving}} {{detection and}} prompt treatment of new infections, and tsetse fly control is {{the backbone of}} the strategy used to control sleeping sickness. Systematic screening of at-risk communities is the best approach, because case-by-case screening is not practical in endemic regions. Systematic screening may be in the form of mobile clinics or fixed screening centres where teams travel daily to areas of high infection rates. Such screening efforts are important because early symptoms are not evident or serious enough to warrant patients with gambiense disease to seek medical attention, particularly in very remote areas. Also, diagnosis of the disease is difficult and health workers may not associate such general symptoms with trypanosomiasis. Systematic screening allows early-stage disease to be detected and treated before the disease progresses, and removes the potential human reservoir. A single case of sexual transmission of West African sleeping sickness has been reported.|$|E

25|$|Many {{cases can}} be safely {{followed}} with <b>active</b> <b>surveillance</b> or watchful waiting. Other treatments may include a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy or chemotherapy. When it only occurs inside the prostate it may be curable. In those in whom the disease has spread to the bones, pain medications, bisphosphonates and targeted therapy, among others, may be useful. Outcomes depend on a person's age and other health problems {{as well as how}} aggressive and extensive the cancer is. Most people with prostate cancer do not end up dying from the disease. The 5-year survival rate in the United States is 99%. Globally it is the second most common type of cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in men. In 2012 it occurred in 1.1 million men and caused 307,000 deaths. It was the most common cancer in males in 84 countries, occurring more commonly in the developed world. Rates have been increasing in the developing world. Detection increased significantly in the 1980s and 1990s in many areas due to increased PSA testing. Studies of males who died from unrelated causes have found prostate cancer in 30% to 70% of those over age 60.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Active</b> <b>surveillance</b> or [...] "watchful waiting" [...] is {{becoming}} more common as small renal masses or tumours are being detected and also within the older generation when surgery is not always suitable. <b>Active</b> <b>surveillance</b> involves completing various diagnostic procedures, tests and imaging to monitor the progression of the RCC before embarking on a more high risk treatment option like surgery.
