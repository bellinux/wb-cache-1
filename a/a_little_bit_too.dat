[...] He went on to describe the weekend as [...] "a good lesson" [...] for the team, taking positive things from the race, such as the good race pace shown by both cars. As {{a result of their}} double retirement, both Ferrari drivers lost their respective positions in the Drivers' Championship. While Vettel was overtaken by Rosberg into second place, Räikkönen lost fourth position to Valtteri Bottas.

[...] By contrast, Henry Adaso of About.com coined the collaboration of Jay Z and Knowles on [...] "Hollywood" [...] as the worst one on the entire album. Louis Pattison of New Musical Express considered Knowles voice as [...] "commanding" [...] on the song. Azeem Ahmad of musicOMH wrote: [...] "Despite the poignancy of the imagery evoked, [...] <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> contrived, clichéd and poppy.

Gus made a similar comment that he prefers thicker material because the thin materials, “they expose everything”.

500|$|A {{common problem}} with the scripts, {{according}} to Novak, is {{that they tend to}} run too long for the regular 22-minute time slot, leading to several cuts. For example, the script for the episode [...] "Search Committee" [...] was initially 75 pages—10 pages too long. A complete script is written for each episode; however, actors are given opportunities to improvise during the shooting process. Fischer said, [...] "Our shows are 100 percent scripted. They put everything down on paper. But we get to play around <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> <b>too.</b> Steve and Rainn are brilliant improvisers." [...] This leads to a large number of deleted scenes with almost every episode of The Office, all of which are considered part of the show's canon and storyline by Daniels. Deleted scenes have sometimes been restored in repeats to make episodes longer or draw back people who have seen the episode before to see the bonus footage. In an experiment, a deleted scene from [...] "The Return" [...] was made available over NBC.com and iTunes, explaining the absence of a character over the next several episodes. Daniels hoped that word of mouth among fans would spread the information, but eventually considered the experiment a failure.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} a mixed response from television critics. IGN contributor Robert Canning said [...] "Flu Shot" [...] {{had a number of}} aspects that he enjoyed, but [...] "as a whole" [...] the episode was not completely satisfying, and reasoned that this episode fell below 30 Rock standards. He said that he personally did not buy the idea of Liz taking a tropical vacation, [...] "hat's just not the Liz I know. But even ignoring this, the bits involved, especially the flashes to Liz on the beach, weren't all that inspired." [...] Canning also was critical of Jack and Elisa's story as he felt it was weak. Overall, he rated the episode a 7.6 out of 10. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote, [...] "Is it just me or was this one of the more lacking episodes of 30 Rock? It's not that it was terrible... but this one just seemed to meander. It wasn't as funny as other episodes... and that whole crew-as-zombies-with-the-flu stuff was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> surreal, even for this show." [...] Further in his review, Sassone wrote that the Tracy and Jenna subplot started funny, but ended [...] "in a lame, predictable manner." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger, also disliked [...] "Flu Shot", opining that it was a disappointment. Sepinwall further added that the Jack and Elisa story [...] "felt {{like something out of a}} bad '80s sitcom – and not even the 30 Rock take on a bad '80s sitcom episode." [...] Sepinwall, however, wrote that the episode did have a good moment with Kenneth suggesting to Tracy that he and Jenna get soup for the sick crew themselves, and with Tracy replying [...] "With what? My arms?".|$|E
500|$|Television critics reacted mostly {{positive}} {{toward the}} episode, calling the storyline [...] "heartfelt." [...] In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded and followed the show, respectively, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, [...] "I spent the entire time expecting the rug to be pulled out {{and the whole thing}} revealed to be Seth MacFarlane just trying to manipulate my emotions." [...] Kaiser went on to compliment series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, stating [...] "some of the more recent formal experiments that the show has done, such as the hour-long murder mystery in this season's premiere, indicate that MacFarlane and company agree with the criticism." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "I have to give props to Family Guy for going outside their wheelhouse without winking excessively at their audience, but I think it may have been <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> far to be truly great." [...] Kaiser ultimately gave the episode a B rating, the best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'" [...] and The Simpsons episode [...] "Moms I'd Like to Forget". In another positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's [...] "funniest moments," [...] which included the opening sequence involving Peter and the Red Bull, as well as the reference to The Price Is Right. Hughes went on to comment that the episode [...] "taught us about the depths and bonds of love that make a family. Whether it's acceptance, hope or sacrifice, there's no limit to what we will do for family." [...] Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also commented positively on the episode, writing in her review of the storyline, [...] "Overall, I found the installment to be refreshing with everyone taking a part in Peter’s dilemma. It was actually sweet and emotional for a change." [...] Moon also praised the scenes involving President Obama, and Stewie's attempt at saving Brian.|$|E

It {{is the first}} night of the battle, and Flickner is cowering at the {{riverbank}} with hundreds of other deserters. He rationalizes his actions by claiming, [...] "I'm not scared, I'm just what they call demoralized." [...] His search for justification leads him to remember the days events: the shattering surprise attack, one failed attempt after another to stand and fight, the endless concussions of oncoming enemy shells, and finally his running away because [...] "so much is enough but <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more is <b>too</b> much." [...] He and the other deserters are jeered at and called cowards by some reinforcements that pass by; their words force Flickner to realize that a coward is exactly what he has been. Without any real conscious effort, he finds himself leaving the riverbank and wandering through the woods looking for his unit. Almost miraculously, he comes upon them getting ready for one last stand. His sergeant, who witnessed his desertion, greets him {{as if nothing had happened}} and directs him back to his old gun.|$|R
5000|$|Rounding Turn 3 on lap 105, Busch's car {{suffered}} {{either a}} left or right-rear tire blowout, then spun towards {{the wall and}} into Jones, Kenseth and Ty Dillon, causing a 6-car pileup. Race leader Earnhardt was clipped by Busch and slammed the wall. He said he didn't [...] "know what happened there with the No. 18 (Busch) he just got turned around. I {{tried to get the}} wheel turned and get down the race track but I lifted off the gas to miss it, and got on the splitter <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> and the car went straight. We jumped him, and got in the wall <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> Wasn’t <b>too</b> hard of a hit. We thought we could get the car fixed, and get back out there and see what we could {{do with the rest of}} the day and make up some spots maybe. But, there is just too much damage. The radiator is pushed back. The toe is all messed up. The front suspension is knocked around pretty bad so the upper A-frame is laid over on the motor. We just can’t drive it like that.” He checked out of the infield care center with no health complications. Earnhardt, who missed 18 races last season due to a concussion, credited his new headrest for walking away without another one, saying [...] "the (older) headrest, when you fly into the wall, it’s like getting hit with a baseball bat. That car will take a few (G-forces) and if you have a lot of distance there, you can double the G’s. We talked to NASCAR over the winter and they helped me understand how to better withstand those wrecks. We have (the headrest) tight on both sides.” Busch took his frustration out on Goodyear. “Nothing that we did wrong,” Busch said to FOX. “Obviously Goodyear tires just aren’t very good at holding air. It’s very frustrating when we have that every single year we’ve been here. Last year we had it as well too. It wrecked us in practice and tore up a car.” Kenseth finished the race in 40th, his third career last-place finish. This brought out the third caution and cleanup necessitated a 17-minute red flag period. Elliott Sadler was the leader when the race resumed under caution, but surrendered the lead to Harvick when he hit pit road.|$|R

It was first rumoured in April 2006 that Adrian Lester might not return as Mickey Bricks in the fourth series; the BBC confirmed his departure in September that year, elevating Marc Warren's character to the lead role and casting Ashley Walters as a new member of the group. The BBC was quick to dispel any suggestion that Lester's resignation was connected to the shift in production focus, stating [...] "it is a shame that, due to his current filming commitments, Adrian cannot join us this time round...", while Lester explained his action as [...] "need to do something else, be associated with something else".
