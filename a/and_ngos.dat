5|$|Immediately {{following}} the cyclone's onslaught, concerns arose amongst relief agencies <b>and</b> <b>NGOs</b> that {{the storm was}} either {{too early in the}} season or not damaging enough to dedicate a significant portion of disaster funds. Consequently, disagreements between prospective donors about the extent of emergency response resulted in delayed intervention. Post-storm assessments of the response to Bonita highlighted the need for increased coordination between agencies.|$|E

5|$|In July 1999, the Communist Party {{initiated}} {{a campaign to}} persecute Falun Gong, including {{through the use of}} extralegal imprisonment, torture and other coercive measures, and propaganda. Falun Gong communities inside and outside China have adopted a variety of approaches to resist and mitigate the persecution in China. These tactics range from engagement with the media, lobbying of governments <b>and</b> <b>NGOs,</b> public protests and demonstrations, and attempts to seek legal redress. As the persecution in China progressed, overseas Falun Gong efforts increasingly tied their pleas for relief to Western human rights discourse, emphasizing the implications for freedom of speech, assembly, and conscience.|$|E

5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{debate about whether}} the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of {{the relevance of the}} Jevons paradox to energy conservation policy. Most governments, environmentalists <b>and</b> <b>NGOs</b> pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that it will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many environmental economists, doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.|$|E
5|$|Thon Saron is {{the provincial}} governor. Commune councils in Ratanakiri are {{composed}} of 223members representing the CPP, 30 members representing the Sam Rainsy Party, and 7 members representing the Funcinpec Party. Political scientist Caroline Hughes {{has suggested that the}} CPP's overwhelming dominance in rural areas such as Ratanakiri stems from the central government's ability to suppress collective action, which in urban areas is offset by international donors <b>and</b> <b>NGOs</b> that provide support for opposition parties. Fifty-one commune council members in Ratanakiri (20%) are women, and 98% of Ratanakiri's government staff was Khmer as of 2006. Bou Lam, a member of the CPP, represents Ratanakiri in the National Assembly of Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} a major {{contributor}} to female mortality in India. Indians account for 60% of the world's heart disease burden, despite accounting for less than 20% of the world's population. Indian women have a particular high mortality from cardiac disease <b>and</b> <b>NGOs</b> such as the Indian Heart Association have been raising awareness about this issue. Women have higher mortality rates relating to cardiovascular disease than men in India because of differential access to health care between the sexes. One reason for the differing rates of access stems from social and cultural norms that prevent women from accessing appropriate care. For example, it was found that among patients with congenital heart disease, women {{were less likely to be}} operated on than men because families felt that the scarring from surgery would make the women less marriageable.|$|E

5|$|Sitakunda has {{a cement}} factory, 12 jute mills, 6 textile mills, 10 {{re-rolling}} mills, and 79 functional and defunct shipyards. Two of the operational jute mills {{are run by}} the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation, and one has been sold to a private sector company. To protest against privatization, workers of Hafiz Jute Mill, Gul Ahmed Jute Mill, MM Jute Mill and RR Jute Mill blocked the Dhaka–Chittagong Highway for seven hours in September 2007. As early as 1953, Sitakunda was described as the location for one of only five poultry farms in East Pakistan, along with Tejgaon (Dhaka), Narayanganj (Dhaka), Jamalpur (Bogra), and Sylhet. Some mining for sand from agricultural lands is carried out along {{the eastern side of}} the Dhaka–Chittagong road. Operators of local brick kilns are engaged in illegal hill cutting, a practice that was responsible along with heavy rainfall for the 2007 Chittagong mudslide. The rural poor are supported by Grameen Bank <b>and</b> <b>NGOs</b> such as CARE, BRAC and ASA.|$|E
5|$|When the Bahraini {{uprising}} {{started in}} early 2011, Matar joined the protests and gave several interviews to international media.

He was allegedly kept in solitary confinement and subjected to torture while in detention before getting tried before a military court. He was released in August and acquitted of charges in February 2012. His arrest, alleged mistreatment and subsequent release triggered several international reactions by international bodies <b>and</b> <b>NGOs</b> such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Inter-Parliamentary Union, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Following his release, Matar continued his political activism.|$|E
5|$|When {{the project}} began, the Society had only eight hundred {{thousand}} taka in its coffers for the project.
