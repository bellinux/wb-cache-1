5|$|In 1900, ETNC offered {{courses in}} nine {{subjects}} (mathematics, philosophy, science, and six languages: English, French, German, Greek, Latin, and Spanish), and its library contained approximately 3,500 volumes. That year, {{the average cost}} of tuition was $4 per month, <b>and</b> <b>room</b> and board was $8.10 per month.|$|E
5|$|Jerry Goldsmith {{wrote the}} {{score for the}} film. The music was {{recorded}} at Rome's Forum Studio in July 1980, and was fraught with difficulties — the studio was not large enough for his orchestra, <b>and</b> <b>room</b> noise made by the players and their equipment affected the tracks.|$|E

5|$|Between 70K <b>and</b> <b>room</b> temperature, {{berkelium}} behaves as a Curie–Weiss {{paramagnetic material}} with an effective magnetic moment of 9.69Bohr magnetons (µB) and a Curie temperature of 101K. This magnetic moment is almost {{equal to the}} theoretical value of 9.72µB calculated within the simple atomic L-S coupling model. Upon cooling to about 34K, berkelium undergoes a transition to an antiferromagnetic state. Enthalpy of dissolution in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −600kJ/mol−1, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔfH°) of aqueous Bk3+ ions is obtained as −601kJ/mol−1. The standard potential Bk3+/Bk0 is −2.01V. The ionization potential of a neutral berkelium atom is 6.23eV.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!, a {{greatest}} hits record, the duo took a hiatus from the mid-1990s before returning with the albums Have a Nice Day (1999) <b>and</b> <b>Room</b> Service (2001). They continued to chart in other territories, mainly in Europe and Latin America, where they earned various Gold and Platinum awards {{until the beginning of}} the new millennium. In 2002, the duo took a break from recording and touring when Fredriksson was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Gessle went on to release solo albums and reunited with Gyllene Tider before Roxette took to the stage together again {{for the first time in}} 8 years, in 2009, during Gessle's European Party Crasher tour. In 2011, they released Charm School, their first studio album in ten years. This was followed by Travelling a year later.|$|E
5|$|Once the Trust took ownership, {{scaffolding}} {{was placed}} in the hallway to repair the roof lantern. While this was in place the architectural paint analyst Lisa Oestreicher was able to examine the decorative scheme that had been used in the spaces <b>and</b> <b>room</b> frequented by the public. Three principal phases were identified: 1860s original; 1870s updates and adaptions; 1887–90 redecoration, which returned the main spaces to the original green colours and motifs created by Crace. Once lantern repairs were complete, the Trust replaced the elderly chenille carpet destroyed by contractors working for Christie's with a new Wilton carpet with a replica design by Linney Cooper, bought with £45,000 from public lottery donations.|$|E
