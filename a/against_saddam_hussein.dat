25|$|Three Kings is a 1999 American satirical black comedy war film {{written and}} {{directed}} by David O. Russell from a story by John Ridley. The film stars George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze as four U.S. soldiers on a gold heist that takes place during the 1991 uprisings in Iraq <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> following the end of the Gulf War.|$|E
25|$|During the 1991 Gulf War <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> ADC {{president}} James Abourezk {{expressed concern}} that Arab Americans would be targeted, revealing that a violent anti-Arab telephone message had been left on an ADC answering machine. ADC documented that more than 100 hate crimes against Arab-Americans were committed from August 1990 through March 1991, including arson against a Detroit restaurant and the planting of a bomb in a San Diego mosque.|$|E
25|$|The Shia {{uprising}} in Karbala {{was one of}} many major points of unrest in Iraq following the Gulf War. The uprising started after demoralized troops throughout Iraq began to rebel <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> From 5 to 19 March 1991, the city of Karbala became a chaotic battlefield between the insurgents and the Iraqi Republican Guard. After the failure of the uprising, citizens were killed in large numbers. Parts of the city were nearly leveled.|$|E

50|$|After {{the end of}} the Gulf War in 1991 the Kurdish region rose up <b>against</b> President <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> {{and gained}} de facto {{independence}} under the protection of a no fly zone. After the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the short-lived Transitional Administrative Law recognised the existing Kurdish regional government and defined Iraq {{for the first time as}} a federal country.|$|R
25|$|SAD teams also {{conducted}} high-risk special reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines to identify senior leadership targets. These missions {{led to the}} initial strikes <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> and his key generals. Although the initial strikes against Saddam were unsuccessful in killing the dictator or his generals, they were successful in effectively ending the ability to command and control Iraqi forces. Other strikes against key generals were successful and significantly degraded the command's ability to react to and maneuver against the U.S.-led invasion force coming from the south.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, Gotovina's {{case was}} {{combined}} with cases of Ivan Čermak and Mladen Markač as they all relate to Operation Storm. The Trial of Gotovina et al was expected to begin in May 2007 but was postponed indefinitely due to conflicts between lawyers on the defence bench. His lawyers were Luka Misetic, an American attorney of Croatian descent, Greg Kehoe, an American lawyer who advised the prosecution in the Iraqi Special Tribunal case <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> and Payam Akhavan, former Legal Advisor to the Prosecutor's Office of the ICTY,.|$|E

25|$|Even though {{autonomy}} {{had been}} agreed in 1970, local population enjoyed no particular democratic freedom denied {{to the rest}} of the country. Things began to change after the 1991 uprising <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> at the end of the Persian Gulf War. United Nations Security Council Resolution 688 gave birth to a safe haven following international concern for the safety of Kurdish refugees. The US and British government established a No Fly Zone over a large part of northern Iraq (see Operation Provide Comfort), however, it left out Sulaymaniyah, Kirkuk and other important Kurdish populated regions. Bloody clashes between Iraqi forces and Kurdish troops continued and, after an uneasy and shaky balance of power was reached, the Iraqi government fully withdrew its military and other personnel from the region in October 1991 allowing Iraqi Kurdistan to function de facto independently. The region was to be ruled by the two principal Kurdish parties; the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The region also has its own flag and national anthem.|$|E
25|$|On 2 August 1990, Saddam {{launched}} a military invasion onto neighboring Kuwait, reportedly {{due to its}} vast oil reserves, which would have helped him pay off the debts he owed to other countries during the Iran–Iraq War (see Gulf War). Within 24 hours, the Emir of Kuwait had fled. However, subsequently, an international coalition force consisting of American, British, Saudi and other troops liberated the country in 1991 and Iraqi troops were forced out of Kuwait (see Operation Desert Storm). Subsequently, {{one month after the}} Gulf War in February 1991, United States President George H. W. Bush called on the Iraqi people to stage an uprising <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> This was followed by a series of rebellions {{in many parts of the}} country, such as the south by Shi'ite groups such as SCIRI and the Islamic Da'awa Party. Meanwhile, the Kurds in the north staged their own uprising for autonomy, under the leadership of Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, and Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The Peshmerga were trained into hardened guerrillas, who managed to infiltrate the Jash, a Saddam-orientated Kurdish militia (see Jash (term) and National Defense Battalions (Iraq)). The rebels soon managed to capture the town of Ranya, Sulaimaniya and ultimately the oil center of Kirkuk. Saddam retaliated swiftly, battering Kirkuk with artillery and targeting hospitals in particular. Geographically the towns captured by the Kurdish rebels were difficult to defend as they sat on plains below mountains. The rebels were forced to retreat in the mountains, where reportedly the Iraqi helicopters threw flour of them (which was believed to be a grim legacy of the reputed powdery chemical weapons which were used by the Iraqi administration during the Al-Anfal Campaign).|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Dylan {{received}} a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award from American actor Jack Nicholson. The event {{coincided with the}} start of the Gulf War <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> and Dylan performed [...] "Masters of War". Dylan then made a short speech, saying [...] "My daddy once said to me, he said, 'Son, it is possible for you to become so defiled in this world that your own mother and father will abandon you. If that happens, God will believe in your ability to mend your own ways.'" [...] This sentiment was subsequently revealed to be a quote from 19th-century German Jewish intellectual, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch.|$|E
50|$|Snyder {{focuses on}} many {{traditionally}} liberal issues, including a {{particular interest in}} support for veteran's and military families. He has a fairly liberal voting record for being an elected politician from the South and otherwise conservative-leaning Arkansas.

In addition, Snyder was one of only two Congressmen to vote <b>against</b> prosecuting <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, a US-UK led {{coalition}} of nations toppled Hussein's government {{in an effort}} called Operation Iraqi Freedom. Although, Israel {{was not included in}} the coalition, there were indications for its support. According to John Kerry, Netanyahu (as a private citizen) was profoundly forward-leaning and outspoken about the importance of invading Iraq. It was reported in the Washington Post that Israel is urging United States' officials not to delay a military strike <b>against</b> Iraq's <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> It was also reported that Israeli intelligence provided Washington with alarming reports about Iraq's alleged program to develop weapons of mass destruction.|$|R

2500|$|The DLC gave {{strong support}} for the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq. Prior to the war, Marshall Wittmann, Sen. Joe Lieberman's press secretary and a senior fellow with Will Marshall's DLC-affiliated Progressive Policy Institute think tank, [...] co-signed a letter to President Bush from the Project for the New American Century endorsing military action <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> During the 2004 Primary campaign, Wittmann attacked Presidential candidate Howard Dean as an out-of-touch liberal because of Dean's anti-war stance. Wittmann dismissed other critics of the Iraq invasion such as filmmaker Michael Moore as members of the [...] "loony left".|$|E
2500|$|The {{establishment}} of the Kurdistan Region {{dates back to the}} March 1970 autonomy agreement between the Kurdish opposition and the Iraqi government after years of heavy fighting. However, that agreement failed to be implemented and by 1974 Northern Iraq plunged into the Second Iraqi–Kurdish War, another part of the [...] Iraqi-Kurdish conflict between the Kurds and the Arab-dominated government of Iraq. Further, the 1980–88 Iran–Iraq War, especially the Iraqi Army's Al-Anfal Campaign, devastated the population and environment of Iraqi Kurdistan. Following the 1991 uprising of Kurds in the north and Shia Arabs in the south <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> Iraqi Kurdistan's military forces, the Peshmerga, succeeded in pushing out the main Iraqi forces from the north.|$|E

2500|$|Under {{the terms}} of the ceasefire of March 1991, corroborated by the {{resolution}} 687 of the UN Security Council, a commission (UNSCOM) was established to assure the dismantling of the Iraqi missile program. They were only allowed to purchase or produce missiles with a range no longer than 150km. [...] At the end of the war, the Iraqi government declared it had only 61 Al-Hussein and other ballistic missiles in its arsenal. These weapons were destroyed under UNSCOM supervision. This process was completed by July 1991. The western powers were however suspicious that the Iraqi army may have hidden as many as 200 missiles. The Iraqis took advantage of the provisions of the ceasefire by developing two types of short-range ballistic missiles, the Ababil-100 and the Al-Samoud, which were in an experimental phase {{at the time of the}} Invasion of Iraq in 2003. These projects were part of the casus belli raised by the American administration <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b>|$|E

[...] Two days before the execution, the International Federation of Human Rights released a statement calling upon the Head of State to issue a moratorium on the death sentence pronounced <b>against</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> by hanging. The organization also said Saddam should be treated as a prisoner of war under the Geneva Conventions. [...] Juan Cole said that the execution might lead to more sectarian turmoil. [...] "The trial and execution of Saddam were about revenge, not justice. Instead of promoting national reconciliation, this act of revenge helped Saddam portray himself one last time as a symbol of Sunni Arab resistance, and became one more incitement to sectarian warfare", he said.|$|E

Following the end of the Cold War, the 1990s was a busy period for United Nations peacekeeping missions, and the Keating Government committed Australian forces to various theatres: at one point during 1993, Australia had some 3000 peacekeepers committed to the field, including a large number in Cambodia and Somalia. Foreign Minister Gareth Evans had taken {{a leading role in the}} organisation of a peace settlement for Cambodia in the aftermath of the genocidal regime of Pol Pot and Australia contributed the force commander. While the United Nations intervention in Cambodia was largely successful, the Somali intervention ended poorly.
