She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness <b>almost</b> <b>more</b> than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the romance of unbounded attachment.|$|E

There were terrible moments that encompassed a lifetime, an endlessness, when terror was so strong in me, that I could feel idiocy replace reason. (Yet,) I have never left my position, nor have I shirked hazardous duty. Fear {{did not make a}} coward out of me.|$|E

25|$|During the {{establishment}} of the European Community, de Gaulle helped precipitate one of the greatest crises {{in the history of the}} EEC, the Empty Chair Crisis. It involved the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy, but <b>almost</b> <b>more</b> importantly the use of qualified majority voting in the EC (as opposed to unanimity). In June 1965, after France and the other five members could not agree, de Gaulle withdrew France's representatives from the EC. Their absence left the organisation essentially unable to run its affairs until the Luxembourg compromise was reached in January 1966. De Gaulle succeeded in influencing the decision-making mechanism written into the Treaty of Rome by insisting on solidarity founded on mutual understanding. He vetoed Britain's entry into the EEC a second time, in June 1967.|$|E

Disturbance of the water when we are 240feet down in the London clay – about the most impervious thing you can possibly find; <b>almost</b> <b>more</b> impervious than granite rock! And the vibration on this railway is to shake down timber trees! Could anything be more ludicrous than to waste the time of the Committee in discussing such things presented by such a body!" ...|$|E

This slowed-down version was produced by Boots with violin arrangements by Margot, both of whom worked on Beyoncé's fifth studio album. Margot said, [...] "It inspires me to work on other artists' songs [...] it pushes my boundaries {{in a direction that}} I wouldn't necessarily come up with. Obviously I know how 'Crazy in Love' goes, but I knew there was the possibility her vocals would be different. It's <b>almost</b> <b>more</b> vulnerable and beautiful this way, because you do do crazy things when you fall in love. To hear the mood reversed and flipped makes it even more powerful." ...|$|E

I had already used the obvious word {{hypothesis}} {{in the sequence}} hypothesis, and in addition I wanted {{to suggest that this}} new assumption was more central and more powerful. ... As it turned out, {{the use of the word}} dogma caused <b>almost</b> <b>more</b> trouble than it was worth. Many years later Jacques Monod pointed out to me that I did not appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma, which is a belief that cannot be doubted. I did apprehend this in a vague sort of way but since I thought that all religious beliefs were without foundation, I used the word the way I myself thought about it, not as most of the world does, and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had little direct experimental support." ...|$|E
500|$|Badmotorfinger {{has been}} {{classified}} by various critics as grunge, alternative metal, heavy metal and hard rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic {{said that the}} songwriting on the album [...] "takes a quantum leap in focus and consistency". He added, [...] "It's surprisingly cerebral and arty music for a band courting mainstream metal audiences, but it attacks with scientific precision." [...] Guitarist Kim Thayil jokingly called it the [...] "Heavy Metal White Album". Cornell said, [...] "I think there's songs on the new record which are <b>almost</b> <b>more</b> commercially viable because they have that memorable feel to them, and I think if anyone expected us {{to come out and}} make something more commercial than Louder Than Love, then I'm glad that they were surprised." [...] Cornell also added that the album was more representative of how the band was live. Shepherd contributed the song [...] "Somewhere" [...] and collaborated on the musical composition of several other songs on the album. Thayil said that Shepherd's contributions helped make the album [...] "faster" [...] and [...] "weirder".|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Kunis {{replaced}} Lacey Chabert in {{the role}} of Meg Griffin on the animated sitcom Family Guy, created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show. When Kunis auditioned for the role, she was called back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her. MacFarlane added: [...] "What Mila Kunis brought to it was in a lot of ways, I thought, <b>almost</b> <b>more</b> right for the character. I say that Lacey did a phenomenal job, {{but there was something about}} Mila– something very natural about Mila. She was 15 when she started, so you were listening to a 15-year-old. Oftentimes with animation they'll have adult actors doing the voices of teenagers and they always sound like Saturday morning voices. They sound oftentimes very forced. She had a very natural quality to Meg that really made what we did with that character kind of really work." [...] Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production in 2007. She also voiced Meg in the Family Guy Video Game!. Kunis described her character as [...] "the scapegoat." ...|$|E

500|$|Many critics {{specifically}} praised Duvall's performance. Sterritt {{called it}} [...] "one {{of the most}} finely wrought achievements to reach the screen in recent memory." [...] In Corliss's description, [...] "Duvall's aging face, a road map of dead ends and dry gulches, can accommodate rage or innocence or any ironic shade in between. As Mac he avoids both melodrama and condescension, finding climaxes in each small step toward rehabilitation, each new responsibility shouldered." [...] Ansen said, [...] "Robert Duvall does another of his extraordinary disappearing acts. He vanishes totally inside the character of Mac Sledge." [...] Maslin said he [...] "so thoroughly transformed into Mac that he even walks with a Texan's rolling gait"; she also complimented the performances of the supporting cast. According to a review in People, [...] "Duvall gives it everything he has, which is saying a great deal. His beery singing voice is a revelation, and his unfussy, brightly burnished acting is the kind for which awards were invented." [...] The review also described Betty Buckley as [...] "bitchy and brilliant". Duvall was praised as well for pulling off his first true romantic role; the actor said of the response, [...] "This is the only film where I've heard people say I'm sexy. It's real romantic. Rural romantic. I love that part <b>almost</b> <b>more</b> than anything." ...|$|E

The Dallas Morning News writer Ed Bark noted that [...] "Grace, Replaced" [...] was [...] "another energetic, generally amusing" [...] episode. Bark, in regards to Jack and Karen, said that the two together [...] "sometimes are <b>almost</b> <b>more</b> than the scenery can bear." [...] Aaron Barnhart for The Kansas City Star called the episode riotous, and said that the show [...] "with [...] pop-culture jokes delivered at blistering speed, outsized performances from 'supporting' players Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally, and a camaraderie between platonic pals Eric McCormack and Debra Massing that would make even Plato blush." [...] Ted Cox of the Daily Herald was less positive about the episode, reporting that this episode [...] "looked like more of the same", recounting the show's past story lines, and past NBC programs. Chicago Tribunes Steve Johnson opined that the episode [...] "starts strong and then goes awry [...] It's funny for a while [...] But then it takes it to a ludicrous level, selling out its own internal logic by conspiring to put [...] Shannon and Messing into a... catfight. At its best this series works a groove of pop-culture savvy; this visit from The Three Stooges by way of Dynasty will have you rolling your eyes in dismay." ...|$|E

That's when I really began to become a fan of John McGeoch. It was an extra bonus for me that they'd got a great guitar player who had left another band and came in as a ringer and joined and not surprisingly, that to me was a very good scenario. I've always liked that. It was like getting George Best on the guitar".|$|E
