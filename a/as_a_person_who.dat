5|$|According to Hossein Nasr, the {{earliest}} European literature often refers to Muhammad unfavorably. A few learned circles of Middle Ages Europeprimarily Latin-literate scholarshad access to fairly extensive biographical material about Muhammad. They interpreted the biography through a Christian religious filter; one that viewed Muhammad <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> seduced the Saracens into his submission under religious guise. Popular European {{literature of the}} time portrayed Muhammad {{as though he were}} worshipped by Muslims, similar to an idol or a heathen god.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Weston {{was found}} incompetent {{to stand trial}} due to mental illness as {{he was a man}} with {{schizophrenia}} who stopped taking his medication. A judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ordered that he be treated with antipsychotic medication without his consent in 2001, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the decision. In 2004, the court determined that Weston still was not competent to be tried, despite ongoing treatment, and suspended but did not dismiss the criminal charges against him. Weston was known to the United States Secret Service prior to the incident <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> had threatened the President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|In Matamoros and Brownsville, curanderos – {{practitioners}} of curanderismo – offered works {{of white and}} black magic. These services are known as brujería (witchcraft). People consult healers and fortune tellers for help with relationships: to revive their romance, to end a marriage, to make someone fall in love, or to hurt someone. People also consult them to drive away negative energy, predict the future and dangerous events, to improve their health, or to bring positive energy. Cisneros grew closer to curanderismo after her firstborn, David, died after being thrown from a moving vehicle by a friend {{while he was in}} St. Joe in 1974. People close to Cisneros described her <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> endured several tragic events growing up. One of her uncles committed suicide when she was young, and her brother drowned as a teenager. But, several others who were close to her maintained that after her son died, Cisneros started to show signs of insanity, became more protective of her children, and began visiting local curanderas.|$|E

5|$|In the Western world, biographers {{began writing}} about Lenin {{soon after his}} death; some – like Christopher Hill – were {{sympathetic}} to him, and others – like Richard Pipes and Robert Gellately – expressly hostile. Some later biographers, such as Read and Lars Lih, sought to avoid making either hostile or positive comments about him, thereby evading politicised stereotypes. Among sympathisers, he was portrayed as having made a genuine adjustment of Marxist theory that enabled it to suit Russia's particular socio-economic conditions. The Soviet view characterised {{him as a man}} who recognised the historically inevitable and accordingly helped to make the inevitable happen. Conversely, the majority of Western historians have perceived him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> manipulated events in order to attain and then retain political power, moreover considering his ideas as attempts to ideologically justify his pragmatic policies. More recently, revisionists in both Russia and the West have highlighted the impact that pre-existing ideas and popular pressures exerted on Lenin and his policies.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} jointly written by Kumar and David Brooks Miller. In order {{to present the}} correct {{technical}} and medical facts in the film, Kumar analysed documents of the court proceedings, forensic evidences and interviewed several survivors of the tragedy and also the staff members of the Union Carbide plant. Bhopal Group for Information and Action and many activists fighting {{for the rights of}} the victim of the disaster wanted to stop the film's screening, called it an insult to the victims, blamed the filmmakers of distorting the facts related to the disaster, diverting attention from Dow Chemical Company which acquired Union Carbide in 2001 and for portraying Anderson <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> wanted to help the people but was unable to do so. Sheen denied these allegations and said that he did not sympathise for Anderson. Kumar also denied these allegations and said that the organisations had seen an older script. He added that making the film was a life-changing experience for him. A Prayer for Rain was added to the film's title because had it rained on the night of 2—3 December 1984, fewer people would have died.|$|E

However, {{according}} to David Godman, {{who has written}} extensively about Ramana, a popular image of him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> {{spent most of his time}} doing nothing except sitting silently in samadhi is highly inaccurate. From the period when an Ashram began to rise around him after his mother arrived, until his later years when his health failed, Ramana was actually quite active in Ashram activities such as cooking and stitching leaf plates.|$|E

25|$|Finally, John Hardy gave {{a speech}} in which he {{expressed}} his astonishment that despite Bruce {{being one of the}} most developed parliamentary constituencies, no candidate had yet been nominated by the electors. He then announced his nomination of Henry Clapcott, the Treasurer of Otago Province at the time, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> he thought would be a suitable representative for the electorate. M. B. Power seconded that nomination. Some speakers opposed Clapcott's nomination, as the provincial superintendent (John Hyde Harris) and the provincial speaker (John L. C. Richardson) were already members of the House of Representatives, and Clapcott as the third-ranked provincial executive member would leave an ineffective executive behind to run Otago.|$|E
25|$|In a 2013 interview, Cardinal Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo, {{designer}} of the coat of arms, said that Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI needed a new coat of arms {{now that he was}} no longer the pontiff. “The problem now is whether the Pope Emeritus can keep that same coat of arms or not,”. “And <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> has always dedicated himself to this, I say ‘no,’”. He drew up a new coat of arms, which he believed could be used now by the former pontiff. He moved the big keys of Saint Peter {{from the back of the}} coat of arms to the top part of the shield and made them much smaller. “But this is only a proposal, it isn’t official,” Montezemolo qualified.|$|E
25|$|Protector: A {{protector}} may {{be appointed}} in an express, inter vivos trust, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> has {{some control over}} the trustee—usually including a power to dismiss the trustee and appoint another. The legal status of a protector {{is the subject of}} some debate. No-one doubts that a trustee has fiduciary responsibilities. If a protector also has fiduciary responsibilities, then the courts—if asked by beneficiaries—could order him or her to act in the way the court decrees. However, a protector is unnecessary to the nature of a trust—many trusts can and do operate without one. Also, protectors are comparatively new, while the nature of trusts has been established over hundreds of years. It is therefore thought by some that protectors have fiduciary duties, and by others that they do not. The case law has not yet established this point.|$|E

25|$|Riipinen {{was chosen}} {{to be the head}} of the local women's {{auxiliary}} Lotta Svärd chapter in 1920. She was elected to the Lotta Svärd central board of directors in 1923 and quickly became a central figure and a well-liked speaker in the organisation. However, she declined inquiries to become the chairperson for the national level. She also became the editor for the Lotta Svärd newspaper. Riipinen later became known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> often had dissenting opinions about decisions made in the board of directors. In particular, she criticized leader Fanni Luukkonen for not participating in IKL meetings but participating in women's day events where left-wing people were invited as well. Riipinen was not chosen {{to the board of directors}} again and was also dismissed from her position as the editor of the Lotta Svärd newspaper in 1936. Her ties with the organisation were only restored during the wartime.|$|E
25|$|Collett, in his book, portrays Dyer as a man, who, got on {{extremely}} well with his men and his juniors, while his contemporaries and seniors were always wary {{of him and}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person,</b> <b>who</b> when he approached a complex political problem: his one thought was to have order; his one tool to get it was the gun. He notes that, {{at the time of}} the Amritsar massacre, Dyer was racked by ill-health and separated from his beloved family - and speculates that - perhaps, this encouraged his extreme view that the Punjab was on the brink of rebellion, the empire about to collapse and feared a mutiny like that of 1857. The solution, he decided, was not just to restore order but to show that the state was in charge. It was not enough to have shops and businesses reopen in Amritsar - an example was needed of the consequences of insubordination.|$|E

At this juncture, the DSP arrives and tells her that he is Velu and not Billa. Later before a party, Velu secretly provides information to the DSP about a meeting of Billa's network and C.J. (Namitha), Billa's girlfriend, overhears his conversation. She challenges Velu but in the fight, he accidentally kills her. A shootout occurs at the party and the DSP is secretly killed by Jagdish, leaving his gun behind. Velu finds the DSP's body and the gun, but is taken into the custody of the police team, now headed by Interpol Officer Gokulnath. He argues during interrogation that he is Velu and not Billa to Gokulnath. Velu mentions a piece of evidence – the pen drive which may prove his innocence but the pen drive is nowhere to be found.|$|E
