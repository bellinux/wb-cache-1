5|$|Later in 1898, back in Romania, Bogdan-Pitești and {{the other}} Salonul Independenților {{initiators}} joined up with author Ioan Bacalbașa and architect Ștefan Ciocâlteu. This diverse group established Societatea Ileana, an association dedicated to supporting innovative artists. Its steering committee was later joined by the intellectual and political figures Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, Nicolae Xenopol, and Nicolae Filipescu, {{as well as by}} the painter Jean Alexandru Steriadi. The society took up the effort to uproot against academic salons, organizing a large <b>and</b> <b>provocative</b> exhibit in 1898, and, at the height of its popularity, enlisted in its ranks some 300 people. Despite such consolidation, various Ileana affiliates were not entirely committed to the cause, and never severed their links with Stănescu's official section.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} West Ham and Millwall has {{involved}} considerable violence {{and is one}} of the most notorious within the world of football hooliganism. The teams were drawn against each other in the second round of the 2009–10 League Cup and met on 25 August 2009 at Upton Park. This was the first time in four years that the two clubs had played each other, and the first ever in the League Cup. Clashes between fans occurred outside the ground, resulting in violence erupting up to half a mile away from the stadium, with serious injuries, include the stabbing of a Millwall supporter, damage to property and several arrests reported by police. There were also several pitch invasions by West Ham supporters which brought a temporary halt to the game. In January 2010, West Ham were fined after being found guilty of violent, threatening, obscene <b>and</b> <b>provocative</b> behaviour and of failing to prevent their fans entering the field of play. Millwall were cleared of all charges.|$|E

25|$|Because of Nietzsche's evocative style <b>and</b> <b>provocative</b> ideas, his {{philosophy}} generates passionate reactions. His works remain controversial, due to varying interpretations and misinterpretations of his work. In the Western philosophy tradition, Nietzsche's writings {{have been described}} as the unique case of free revolutionary thought, that is, revolutionary in its structure and problems, although not tied to any revolutionary project.|$|E

25|$|Since 1984, American hip hop {{has had a}} major influence, and a hip hop crew, Nuuk Posse, {{has been}} one of the most {{successful}} groups of recent years. Other Greenlandic hip hop groups/artists have since then released albums. These artists include rappers such as Prussic, Peand-El, and Tomba. Their lyrics are more offensive <b>and</b> <b>provocative</b> than those of Nuuk Posse, criticizing the Greenlandic community for abandoning and neglecting their kids.|$|E
25|$|Verhoeven {{followed}} those successes {{with the}} equally intense <b>and</b> <b>provocative</b> Basic Instinct (1992), an erotic thriller. The ninth-highest-grossing {{film of the}} year, the movie was a return to themes Verhoeven had explored in Turkish Delight and The Fourth Man. The film's most notorious scene shows Sharon Stone's character in a police interrogation, where she uncrosses her legs, briefly revealing her vulva (she does not wear underwear underneath her skirt). The film received two Academy Awards nominations, for Film Editing and for Original Music.|$|E

25|$|This {{influence}} {{continues to}} guide some of today's most significant <b>and</b> <b>provocative</b> philosophical work, {{as many of}} these same students became eminent intellectuals in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s: Alain Badiou, Étienne Balibar and Jacques Rancière in philosophy, Pierre Macherey in literary criticism and Nicos Poulantzas in sociology. The prominent Guevarist Régis Debray also studied under Althusser, as did the aforementioned Derrida (with whom he at one time shared an office at the ENS), noted philosopher Michel Foucault, and the pre-eminent Lacanian psychoanalyst Jacques-Alain Miller.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{reactions}} to local anesthetics (especially the esters) are not uncommon, but true allergy is very rare. Allergic {{reactions to}} the esters is usually due to a sensitivity to their metabolite, para-aminobenzoic acid, and does not result in cross-allergy to amides. Therefore, amides {{can be used as}} alternatives in those patients. Nonallergic reactions may resemble allergy in their manifestations. In some cases, skin tests <b>and</b> <b>provocative</b> challenge may be necessary to establish a diagnosis of allergy. Also cases of allergy to paraben derivatives occur, which are often added as preservatives to local anesthetic solutions.|$|E

He also emphasised the common aims of French and English Canadians in the pursuit of freedom in the capitalist and colonial systems. Although researched and mostly written while Ryerson was occupied with the direction of the underground party, French Canada was a careful <b>and</b> <b>provocative</b> analysis of Quebec's social and political history.|$|E

25|$|During a League Cup game on 25 August 2009, violent clashes transpired {{between the}} two sets of supporters' outside Upton Park. Police {{estimated}} hundreds of fans were involved. Millwall supporter Alan Baker was stabbed and left fighting for his life. The pitch was invaded three times by West Ham supporters, causing play to be suspended. The Football Association charged both clubs, investigated the aftermath and eventually fined West Ham £115,000. They were found to have failed to ensure their fans refrained from violent, threatening, obscene <b>and</b> <b>provocative</b> behaviour and from entering the field of play. Millwall were cleared of all charges.|$|E

Slim gives a puppy to Lennie and Candy, whose loyal, accomplished sheep dog was put down by fellow ranch-hand Carlson.|$|E
25|$|Grisettes {{appeared}} in many caricatures of bohemian Paris, {{most notably in}} those by Daumier and Gavarni, {{as well as in}} illustrations of novels about them, such as Gerald du Maurier's own engravings for Trilby. The artist and war correspondent, Constantin Guys, frequently portrayed them in his sketches of Parisian life during the Second French Empire. A grisette likewise became the subject of one of Edward Hopper's early watercolours, painted in Paris in 1906. Hopper's portrayal, like several of those by Guys, shows the grisette wearing a traditional seamstress apron. However, their slightly raised skirts (particularly in the Guys sketches) <b>and</b> <b>provocative</b> poses also allude to the association of grisettes with prostitution.|$|E
