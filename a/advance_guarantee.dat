The algorithm regulates model complexity during the learning procedure, generating the best low-complexity approximation to the Bayes-optimal classifier {{allowed by the}} training sample.

The algorithm generates a simple neural network classifier from the benchmark partitioning of the database; the classifier has 650 total parameters and exhibits a test sample error rate of 1. 3 %. 1 INTRODUCTION Recent advances in machine learning theory {{make it possible to}} generate pattern classifiers that are consistently robust estimates of the Bayes-optimal (i. e., minimum probability-of-error) classifier.

40|$|The {{most widely}} used {{controllers}} in industry are still the proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) and discrete-time proportional, summation, and difference (PSD) controllers, thanks to their simplicity and performance characteristics. However, with these conventional fixed gain controllers we could have difficulties to handle nonlinear or time-variant characteristics. The introduction of linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems led to various gain-scheduled controller design techniques in both state-space and frequency domain during the last 30 years. In spite of all these, {{there is still a}} lack of general approaches for <b>advanced</b> <b>guaranteed</b> cost PID/PSD controller design approaches for LPV systems. In this paper a new advanced controller design approach for discrete-time gain-scheduled guaranteed cost PSD controller design with input saturation and anti-windup is presented for uncertain LPV systems. In addition, the controller design problem is formulated in such a way, which gives convex dependency regarding the scheduled parameters. It results in a less conservative controller design compared to approaches using quadratic stability or the multiconvexity lemma and it's relaxations. Finally, a numerical example shows the benefits of the proposed approach...|$|R

40|$|Many {{embedded}} systems {{are subject to}} temporal constraints that require <b>advance</b> <b>guarantees</b> on meeting deadlines. Such systems rely on static analysis to safely bound worst-case execution (WCET) bounds of tasks. Designers of these systems are forced to avoid state-of-the-art processors due to their inherent architectural complexity that results in non-determinism. Such micro-processors are typically tuned to reduce average-case execution times — {{at the expense of}} predictability. Dynamic instruction scheduling techniques, such as out-of-order (OOO) execution, are examples of features that reduce average time but are statically unpredictable at large. This work addresses this problem by providing analysis techniques for characterizing the worst-case behavior of real-time systems on modern processor architectures. We propose minor enhancements to processor architectures that, coupled with static analysis techniques, support the derivation of safe WCET bounds. We also introduce novel pipeline analysis techniques for accurately capturing the worst-case behavior of real-time tasks, i. e., methods to capture (“snapshot”) pipeline state and to subsequently perform a “merge ” of previously captured snapshots. We prove that our pipeline analysis correctly preserves worst-case timing behavior on OOO processor pipelines. We further specifically show that anomalous pipeline effects, effectively dilating timing, are preserved by our method. To the best of our knowledge, this method of pipeline analysis and interactions between hardware/software for obtaining WCET bounds on OOO processors is the first of its kind. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Lightpath {{scheduling}} is {{an important}} capability in next-generation wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks to reserve resources in advance for a specified time period while provisioning end-to-end lightpaths. In this study, we propose an approach to support dynamic lightpath scheduling in such networks. To minimize blocking probability in a network that accommodates dynamic scheduled lightpath demands (D-SLDs), resource allocation should be optimized in a dynamic manner. However, for the network users who desire deterministic services, resources must be reserved in <b>advance</b> and <b>guaranteed</b> for future use. These two objectives may be mutually incom-patible. Therefore, we propose a two-phase dynamic lightpath scheduling approach to tackle this issue. The first phase is the deterministic lightpath scheduling phase. When a lightpath request arrives, the network control plane schedules a path wit...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{deals with}} {{trajectory}} planning for image based eye-in-hand visual servoing applications. Trajectories for extracted feature points {{of a target}} object are computed directly in the projective image space such that they are compatible with rigid body displacements. To this end, one separately parameterizes for i) the collineation {{with respect to the}} plane at infinity (which {{can be viewed as a}} projective representation of the rotation) and ii) the projective representation of the translation. Parameterizing the collineation by the use of a decomposition into its canonical form provides an easy way to plan for a geodesic displacement. Furthermore, different strategies are proposed to interpolate for the translation path. As a result, the most <b>advanced</b> strategy <b>guarantees,</b> by the use of a simple analytic criterion, that the points remain visible during the whole path. The method requires in general nothing more than the initial and final images and does not depend on intrinsic camera parameters. I...|$|R
