40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] study attempts to advance knowledge {{in the area of}} controversial advertising by examining the antecedents and consequences of controversial <b>advert</b> perceptions in the context of social media, and particularly social networking sites (SNS). Specifically, we explore how ethical judgement and religious commitment shape controversial <b>advert</b> perceptions leading to attitudes towards the <b>advert,</b> brand attitudes and purchase intentions. Our results indicate that when a SNS <b>advert</b> is judged to be ethically acceptable, the level of perceived <b>advert</b> controversy is lower. However, the impact of ethical judgement on controversial <b>advert</b> perceptions becomes significant and positive when intra-personal commitment and inter-personal religious commitment are introduced as moderators. This result implies that the level of religious commitment changes the ethical judgement - controversial <b>advert</b> perceptions relationship. The results also highlight that controversial <b>advert</b> perceptions negatively influence attitude toward the <b>advert.</b> The study contributes to the limited knowledge on controversial advertising on SNS, yielding significant and relevant implications for academics and advertisers alike, in their effort to improve advertising effectiveness without offending or alienating target audiences...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of Swedish job <b>adverts</b> {{published}} on recruitment websites. The thesis has a qualitative approach and is including three parts. The first part is an analysis of 50 job <b>advert</b> to create an understanding for what a job <b>advert</b> looks like today, 2010. This part study resulted in a prototype of a typical Swedish job <b>advert</b> published on recruitment web-sites 2010. The second part is a literature study {{in order to find}} out what the recommenda-tions from experts for writing job <b>adverts</b> are at present. This step generated a list of 21 kinds of advice that the experts recommend that one should think of when writing a job <b>advert.</b> The last part consists of group interviews with Swedish speaking business admini-stration students about their thoughts and perceptions of content in job <b>adverts.</b> The result shows that the respondents preferred job <b>adverts</b> that were branded (informed the applicant of the employer). They thought that the job <b>adverts</b> were very stereotype and written in a cliché language. And they also preferred job <b>adverts</b> that contained information about what employer could offer an employee apart from the job itself (in non financial terms). It was also clear that the students were reading in and interpreting a lot meaning behind the words. As an overall conclusion the study suggests that there is food for thought when it comes to how job <b>adverts</b> are being written in Sweden in 2010 and that the field of effec-tiveness of job <b>adverts</b> is in serious need of more research...|$|R
