5|$|Burrows was {{the closest}} friend on the Canucks to former {{teammate}} Luc Bourdon, {{who died in a}} motorcycle accident in May 2008. In the hockey season following his death, Burrows occasionally celebrated goals with a bow-and-arrow mime, <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> Bourdon himself did after scoring during his junior career. He and his wife (girlfriend at the time) remained close to Bourdon's girlfriend, Charlene Ward.|$|E
5|$|Following this success, Jackson {{began to}} direct several {{personal}} insults at Silva, <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> infuriated the champion. Silva {{was in the}} midst of what would be a 17-fight unbeaten streak. He captured the championship from Sakuraba at Pride 17, and defeated him a total of three times. Jackson continued his negative comments towards the champion, and directed his latest insult at Silva's training camp at the time, the Chute Boxe Academy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the smaller}} painting, Mary averts {{her eyes and}} folds her hands in <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> symbolised {{submission}} to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.|$|E

5|$|Vithoba {{is shown}} {{standing}} arms-akimbo on the brick thrown by the devotee Pundalik. He wears {{a necklace of}} tulsi-beads, embedded with the legendary kaustubha gem, and makara-kundala (fish-shaped earrings) that the poet-saint Tukaram relates to the iconography of Vishnu. Pandharpur's Vithoba holds a shankha (conch) {{in his left hand}} and a chakra (discus) or lotus flower in his right, all of which are symbols traditionally associated with Vishnu. Some images depict Vithoba's right hand making <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> has been traditionally misunderstood as a blessing; no gesture of blessing is present in the Pandharpur image. Though usually depicted two-armed, four-armed representations of the deity also exist.|$|E
25|$|Each saint {{stands on}} a stone plinth inscribed with his name. John the Baptist, {{the son of the}} priest Zechariah (not to be {{confused}} with the prophet of the same name shown on the upper register), holds a lamb in his left arm and is turned towards Joost Vijdt. His right hand is raised and his finger extended to point towards the lamb, <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> implies that he is reciting the Agnus Dei. John the Evangelist holds a chalice, a reference to the early medieval tradition that he had ability with cures; he could drink poison from a cup without ill effects.|$|E
500|$|In late 629, Li Shimin, by now Emperor of China, {{ordered the}} {{erection}} of Buddhist monasteries on {{the sites of}} seven of the battles he had fought during the civil war. In <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> illustrated the emperor's desire to bridge and heal the divisions of the conflict, for Hulao he chose the name [...] "Temple of Equality in Commiseration".|$|E

500|$|In London, {{more than}} a million people filled the area outside Westminster Abbey and along the [...] route from central London to her final resting place beside her husband and younger {{daughter}} in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. At her request, after her funeral the wreath that had lain atop her coffin was placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, in <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> echoed her wedding-day tribute 79 years before.|$|E
500|$|Coalition and Afghan {{authorities}} {{continued their}} efforts to win over Taliban sympathizers. However a [...] "miscommunication between authorities" [...] created some tension. In late December, two western diplomats were expelled from Afghanistan. Governor Assadullah Wafa accused them of holding secret talks with the Taliban and proposing bribes to them; the secret talks were denied as a misunderstanding by a UN spokesperson. In January 2008, Mullah Abdul Salaam was appointed governor of Musa Qala district by the Afghan government, <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> was intended to encourage other Taliban commanders to change sides.|$|E
500|$|On 24 May 1788, Bounty {{anchored}} in False Bay, {{east of the}} Cape of Good Hope, where five weeks were spent in repairs and reprovisioning. Bligh's letters home emphasised how fit and well he and his crew were, by comparison with other vessels, and expressed hope that he would receive credit for this. At one stage during the sojourn, Bligh lent Christian money, <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> the historian Greg Dening suggests might have sullied their relationship by becoming a source of anxiety and even resentment to the younger man. In her account of the voyage, Caroline Alexander describes the loan as [...] "a significant act of friendship", but one which Bligh ensured Christian did not forget.|$|E

500|$|Harrison is {{also seen}} {{walking around the}} grounds of Friar Park. In these scenes, he wears scruffy, present-day attire that {{represents}} [...] "his own, new identity", according to Leng, who likens Harrison's appearance to the character {{on the cover of}} Jethro Tull's Aqualung album. Harrison mimes the final choruses inside the house, filmed in close-up and surrounded by a cast of [...] "dwarfs, gnomes and other Pythonesque characters". At the end of the clip, he is seen at the flagpole {{on the roof of the}} house, replacing a pirate standard with his yellow-and-red Om flag â€“ <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> was the opposite of Boyd's when she learned of Harrison's affair with Maureen Starkey. The video was directed by Harrison and filmed by Nick Knowland.|$|E
500|$|The depot {{was reached}} on 28 January. Wild, ill with dysentery, {{was unable to}} pull or to eat {{anything}} but biscuits, which were in short supply. On 31 January Shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on Wild, <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> moved Wild to write: [...] "BY GOD I shall never forget. Thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit". A few days later, {{the rest of the}} party were struck with severe enteritis, the result of eating tainted pony-meat. But the pace of march had to be maintained; the small amounts of food carried between depots would make any delay fatal. Fortunately a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on the sledge and maintain a good marching rate.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the dinner}} party, Onassis and Thyssen {{went to a}} disco where she punched a fellow dancer in the face (who then fell to the floor) after he {{suggested}} that she was only with Onassis because of his father's wealth. Onassis {{wanted to have a}} committed relationship with Thyssen from their first meeting, which she initially resisted, but the deep relationship which eventually developed between the pair was resisted by Onassis's mother, who constantly sought to sabotage it. Onassis's father also sought to undermine his son's relationship by buying him a $2 million villa outside Athens, <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> Thyssen felt was an attempt to mold her into just another [...] "Onassis object...to be manipulated, brutalised and treated on any level and on any terms he chooses." [...] Thyssen only accepted gifts from Onassis if they were paid from the small amount that he earned.|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Markham's prejudices about polar travel, particularly his belief in the [...] "nobility" [...] of manhauling, had been passed to Scott, to the detriment of all future British expeditions. Mill's measured opinion, that Markham was [...] "an enthusiast rather than a scholar", has been asserted as a fair summary of his strengths and weaknesses, and as the basis for his influence on the discipline of geography in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is commemorated by Mount Markham, , in the Transantarctic range, discovered and named by Scott on his southern march during the Discovery expedition in 1902. The Markham River in Papua New Guinea was named after him; Carsten Borchgrevink discovered and named Markham Island in the Ross Sea during his 1900 expedition, <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> was not, however, acknowledged by Markham. The name lives on in Lima, Peru, through Markham College, a private co-educational school. Minna Bluff, a promontory extending into the Ross Ice Shelf, was named by Scott for Lady Markham.|$|E
500|$|Within the band, {{according}} to the author Peter Doggett, [...] "the most essential line of communication... between Lennon and McCartney" [...] had been broken by Ono's presence {{on the first day}} of recording. While echoing this view, Beatles biographer Philip Norman comments that, from the start, each of the group's two principal songwriters shared a mutual disregard for the other's new compositions: Lennon found McCartney's songs [...] "cloyingly sweet and bland", while McCartney viewed Lennon's as [...] "harsh, unmelodious and deliberately provocative". In a move that Lewisohn highlights as unprecedented in the Beatles' recording career, Harrison and Starr chose to distance themselves part-way through the project, flying to California on 7 June so that Harrison could film his scenes for the Ravi Shankar documentary Raga. Lennon, McCartney and Harrison's involvement in individual musical projects outside the band during 1968 was further evidence of the group's fragmentation. In Lennon's case, the cover of his experimental collaboration with Ono, Two Virgins, featured the couple fully naked â€“ <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> his bandmates found bewildering and unnecessary.|$|E
500|$|Hay {{remained}} disaffected {{from the}} Republican Party in the mid-1870s. [...] Seeking a candidate of either party he could support as a reformer, {{he watched as}} his favored Democrat, Samuel Tilden, gained his party's nomination, but his favored Republican, James G. Blaine, did not, falling to Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes, whom Hay did not support during the campaign. Hayes's victory in the election left Hay [...] an outsider as he sought a return to politics, and he was initially offered {{no place in the}} new administration. Nevertheless, Hay attempted to ingratiate himself with the new President by sending him a gold ring with a strand of George Washington's hair, <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> Hayes deeply appreciated. Hay spent time working with Nicolay on their Lincoln biography, and traveling in Europe. [...] When Reid, who had succeeded Greeley as editor of the Tribune, was offered the post of Minister to Germany in December 1878, he turned it down and recommended Hay. [...] Secretary of State William M. Evarts indicated that Hay [...] "had not been active enough in political efforts", to Hay's regret, who told Reid that he [...] "would like a second-class mission uncommonly well".|$|E

500|$|Lynette Porter, in {{her book}} Tarnished Heroes, Charming Villains and Modern Monsters: Science Fiction in Shades of Gray on 21st Century Television {{observed}} that Rose's role [...] "humanizes the Doctor and makes him less alien, not only to other characters, but to the audience". In the first series finale, Rose takes on deadly energies to save the Doctor and planet Earth. Script editor Helen Raynor felt the episode gave Rose a chance to [...] "again be the Doctorâ€™s equal" [...] and [...] "to finally match him with <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> is so noble, and strong, and heroic, and clever". Davies describes Rose {{in the context of}} this scene, and the whole of the first series, as being [...] "braver than brave and more loyal than anyone else in the universe". The Doctor repays her loyalty by sacrificing his ninth incarnation in turn to save her; Davies states unequivocally that [...] "he gives his life for her". Elements of Rose's characterisation in the first series were originally different. Paul Abbott was scheduled to write an episode which would have revealed that Rose's entire life had been manipulated by the Doctor in order to mould her into an ideal companion. Davies wrote the episode [...] "Boom Town" [...] to replace it when Abbott realised he was too busy to work on the script.|$|E
500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Macrobius {{describes}} a masculine form of [...] "Venus" [...] (Aphrodite) who received cult on Cyprus; {{she had a}} beard and male genitals, but wore women's clothing. The deity's worshippers cross-dressed, men wearing women's clothes, and women men's. The Latin poet Laevius wrote of worshipping [...] "nurturing Venus" [...] whether female or male (sive femina sive mas). The figure was sometimes called Aphroditos. In several surviving examples of Greek and Roman sculpture, the love goddess pulls up her garments to reveal her male genitalia, <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> traditionally held apotropaic or magical power.|$|E
