Girls made offerings to Artemis on the eve of their marriage, during pregnancy, and at childbirth. Although girls and boys appear on the wine jugs connected with the early-spring festival of the Anthesteria, depictions of boys are far more common.|$|E
5|$|Theobald's {{cathedral chapter}} was {{composed}} of monks, and he was considered the abbot of the monastery of Christ Church Cathedral. Because of his episcopal duties, the regular running of the cathedral was {{the responsibility of the}} prior. At the time of Theobald's election there were about 140 monks in the chapter, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to have expected that Theobald, being a monk himself, would take their side in disputes and continue to support their needs. Theobald began well, sending a party of monks from the cathedral to St Martin's Priory at Dover, which had been settled with canons instead of monks. Theobald replaced the canons with the monks. Theobald also refounded a collegiate church at South Malling near Lewes to provide benefices for his cathedral chapter.|$|E

25|$|According to Silva Lake, textual critic, {{the text}} of the codex is a {{somewhat}} dilute form of family Π, with a large number of peculiar readings, most of which are either misspellings or careless and ignorant mistakes. An educated scribe could hardly have produced the variants in Mark 4:1; 6:26; 9:4; 13:3; 14:38; 16:4. The readings which it does not share with other representatives of Family Π are supported outside that family <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to be connected with the late Alexandrian group (C, L, M, N, Δ), but the number of the Alexandrian readings is not high and according to Silva they are rather result of accident than influence of a foreign text-type.|$|E
25|$|The same {{situation}} is in evidence in everyday life, however, whenever attention is fixated {{with a question}} or an experience of the amazing, the unusual, or anything that holds a person's interest. At such moments people experience the common everyday trance; they tend to gaze {{off to the right}} or left, depending upon which cerebral hemisphere is most dominant (Baleen, 1969) and get that faraway or blank look. Their eyes may actually close, their bodies tend to become immobile (a form of catalepsy), certain reflexes (e.g., swallowing, respiration, etc.) may be suppressed, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> momentarily oblivious to their surroundings until they have completed their inner search on the unconscious level for the new idea, response, or frames of reference that will restabilize their general reality orientation. We hypothesize that in everyday life consciousness is in a continual state of flux between the general reality orientation and the momentary microdynamics of trance...|$|E

25|$|Halley's {{visits to}} Newton in 1684 thus {{resulted}} from Halley's debates about planetary motion with Wren and Hooke, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to have provided Newton with the incentive and spur {{to develop and}} write what became Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. Halley {{was at that time}} a Fellow and Council member of the Royal Society in London (positions that in 1686 he resigned to become the Society's paid Clerk). Halley's visit to Newton in Cambridge in 1684 probably occurred in August. When Halley asked Newton's opinion on the problem of planetary motions discussed earlier that year between Halley, Hooke and Wren, Newton surprised Halley by saying that he had already made the derivations some time ago; but that he could not find the papers. (Matching accounts of this meeting come from Halley and Abraham De Moivre to whom Newton confided.) Halley then had to wait for Newton to 'find' the results, but in November 1684 Newton sent Halley an amplified version of whatever previous work Newton had done on the subject. This took the form of a 9-page manuscript, De motu corporum in gyrum (Of the motion of bodies in an orbit): the title is shown on some surviving copies, although the (lost) original may have been without title.|$|E
500|$|Treasury Secretary Mellon also {{recommended}} to Congress that {{income tax rates}} be cut. He asked that the excess profits tax on corporations be abolished. The House Ways and Means Committee endorsed Mellon's proposals, but some congressmen, who wanted to raise tax rates on corporations, fought the measure. Harding was unsure what side to endorse, telling a friend, [...] "I can't make a damn thing out of this tax problem. I listen to one side, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> right, and then—God!—I talk to the other side, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> just as right." [...] Harding tried compromise, and gained passage of the bill in the House {{after the end of}} the excess profits tax was delayed a year. In the Senate, the tax bill became entangled in efforts to vote World War I veterans a soldier's bonus. Frustrated by the delays, on July 12, Harding appeared before the Senate and urged it to pass the tax legislation without the bonus. It was not until November that the revenue bill finally passed, with higher rates than Mellon had proposed.|$|E
500|$|Varro's book on {{agriculture}} describes an aviary {{with a wooden}} dome decorated with the eight winds that is compared by analogy to the eight winds depicted on the Tower of the Winds, which was built in Athens {{at about the same}} time. This aviary with its wooden dome may represent a fully developed type. Wooden domes in general would have allowed for very wide spans. Their earlier use may have inspired the development and introduction of large stone domes of previously unprecedented size. [...] Complex wooden forms were necessary for dome centering and support during construction, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to have eventually become more efficient and standardized over time.|$|E

500|$|Following script rewrites, Cherry {{pitched the}} series to ABC, who {{picked up the}} pilot. ABC {{executives}} were, however, concerned about {{the title of the}} series, which Cherry had selected before even writing the script. They suggested renaming the series Wisteria Lane or The Secret Lives of Housewives, but Cherry insisted on keeping the original title. He later commented, [...] "I put 'desperate' [...] to try to indicate, however subtly... I'm going to have some fun with the imagery, to take it to some interesting places. Most critics got the joke. Some people see the word 'housewives' and it pushes a button in them <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to lose all reason." [...] The project was officially announced on October 23, 2003 as a cross between American Beauty and Knots Landing. While Desperate Housewives, along with fellow new series Grey's Anatomy and Lost, would later help reverse ABC's flagging fortune, network executives Lloyd Braun and Susan Lyne were fired shortly after greenlighting these risky and expensive pilots.|$|E

2500|$|Books {{that are}} known objectively not to have existed in antiquity are usually not {{considered}} part of the New Testament Apocrypha.

2500|$|Oromo has no {{indefinite}} articles (corresponding to English a, some), but (except in {{the southern}} dialects) it indicates definiteness (English the) with suffixes on the noun: -(t)icha for masculine nouns (the ch is geminated though this is not normally indicated in writing) and -(t)ittii for feminine nouns. [...] Vowel endings of nouns are dropped before these suffixes: karaa 'road', karicha 'the road', nama 'man', namicha/namticha 'the man', haroo 'lake', harittii 'the lake'. [...] Note that for animate nouns that can take either gender, the definite suffix may indicate the intended gender: qaalluu 'priest', qaallicha 'the priest (m.)', qallittii 'the priest (f.)'. [...] The definite suffixes appear to be used less often than the in English, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> not to co-occur with the plural suffixes.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, a {{cell phone}} video {{captured}} two dark shapes in the water. A suggested {{explanation is that the}} video shows two logs. Radford analyzed the video for Discovery News and concluded that “The video quality is poor and the camera is shaky, but {{a closer look at the}} 30-second video reveals that, instead of one long object, there are actually two shorter ones, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to be floating next to each other at slightly different angles. There are no humps, nor head, nor form; only two long, darkish, more or less straight forms that appear to be a few dozen feet long. In short, they look a lot like floating logs, which would not be surprising since Lake Okanagan has tens of thousands of logs harvested by the timber industry floating just under the lake's surface." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{not known}} for certain if Arnold de Lantins was a {{relative}} of Hugo de Lantins, a composer active at the same time, but since their works often appear together in collections <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> {{to have been in}} the same geographical regions, it is not unlikely, however a sharp stylistic difference between the works of the two composers shows they can not be the same person. Earlier theories that there was a third [...] "de Lantins," [...] a certain Ray de Lantins, known from a single inscription in Munich, Bayerischestaatsbibliothek Mus. 3224, were shown to be wrong in 2012 by Margaret Bent and Robert Klugseder, upon the discovery of a second, fuller inscription to [...] "Raynaldus de lantins" [...] of a Credo ascribed to Arnold de Lantins in two other sources. This ascription makes it extremely likely that Ray should be read as a variant of Arnold.|$|E
