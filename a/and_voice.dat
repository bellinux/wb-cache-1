40|$|Men {{generally}} prefer feminine women’s faces <b>and</b> <b>voices</b> over masculine women’s faces <b>and</b> <b>voices,</b> <b>and</b> these cross-modal {{preferences are}} positively correlated. Men’s preferences for female facial and vocal femininity have typically been investigated independently by presenting soundless still images separately from audio-only vocal recordings. For {{the first time}} ever, we presented men with short video clips in which dynamic faces <b>and</b> <b>voices</b> were simultaneously manipulated in femininity/masculinity. Men preferred feminine men’s faces over masculine men’s faces, and preferred masculine men’s voices over feminine men’s voices. We found that men preferred feminine women’s faces <b>and</b> <b>voices</b> over masculine women’s faces <b>and</b> <b>voices.</b> Men’s attractiveness ratings of both feminine and masculine faces were increased {{by the addition of}} vocal femininity. Also, men’s attractiveness ratings of feminine <b>and</b> masculine <b>voices</b> were increased by the addition of facial femininity present in the video. Men’s preferences for vocal and facial femininity were significantly and positively correlated when stimuli were female, but not when they were male. Our findings complement other evidence for cross-modal femininity preferences among male raters, and show that preferences observed in studies using still images and/or independently presented vocal stimuli are also observed when dynamic faces <b>and</b> <b>voices</b> are displayed simultaneously in video format...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{findings}} indicate that semantic and episodic information {{is more likely to}} be retrieved from faces than voices [Damjanovic & Hanley, 2007, Memory and Cognition, 35 (6), 1205 - 1210]. Previous studies investigating this 'face advantage' over voice used famous faces <b>and</b> <b>voices</b> as stimuli, which induced several methodological difficulties. We present four studies aimed at further examining the differential retrieval of semantic and episodic information from faces <b>and</b> <b>voices.</b> Study 1 <b>and</b> 2 compare the retrieval of semantic and episodic information from pre-experimentally personally familiar faces <b>and</b> <b>voices</b> [Brédart, Barsics, & Hanley, 2009, European Journal of Cognitive Psychology, 21 (7), 1013 - 1021; Barsics & Brédart, 2011, Consciousness and Cognition, 20 (2), 303 - 308]. In Study 3, an associative learning paradigm is used in order to strictly control the frequency of exposure with faces <b>and</b> <b>voices.</b> The recall of semantic information is subsequently assessed from faces <b>and</b> <b>voices.</b> In Study 4, distinctiveness impact on semantic information retrieval from faces <b>and</b> <b>voices</b> is assessed, as it could constitute a key factor underlying the face advantage over voice. All results are in line with the face advantage. These findings are discussed at the light of current models of person recognition. An account in terms of expertise is finally proposed.
