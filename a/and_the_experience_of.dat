5|$|Fears grew {{about the}} threat of French raids across England from the 1380s onward. The {{citizens}} of Norwich were particularly concerned about the potential of a French raid on the city, drawing parallels between the position of Norwich <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> Southampton, another trading city that had been devastated by a French attack in 1338. This threat, combined with the recent events of the Peasant Revolt of 1381 when the rebels had looted the city, encouraged the local government to improve the city's defences.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as an All Black team was touring South Africa, Australia were touring New Zealand. The two tours coincided because Māori players were not able to go to South Africa at the time, meaning the Australians, played against a New Zealand team made up of the best Māori and the reserve non-Māori players, while the South Africans {{encountered}} the best pākehā (non-Māori) players. On the afternoon of 3 September New Zealand, captained by Johnny Smith, were beaten 11–6 by Australia in Wellington. New Zealand then lost their second test 16–9, which gave Australia a Bledisloe Cup series win in New Zealand for the first time. 1949 was an annus horribilis for the All Blacks as they lost all six of their test matches, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> playing two test series simultaneously has not been repeated.|$|E

5|$|Great Barrington had a {{majority}} European American community, who treated Du Bois generally well. He attended the local integrated public school {{and played with}} white schoolmates. As an adult, he wrote about racism which he felt as a fatherless child <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> being a minority in the town. But teachers recognized his ability and encouraged his intellectual pursuits, and his rewarding experience with academic studies led him {{to believe that he}} could use his knowledge to empower African Americans. Du Bois graduated from the town's Searles High School. When Du Bois decided to attend college, the congregation of his childhood church, the First Congregational Church of Great Barrington, raised the money for his tuition.Horne, p. 7.Lewis, pp. 39–40.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} function, the insula is {{believed}} to process convergent information to produce an emotionally relevant context for sensory experience.

25|$|On {{the level}} of {{developmental}} psychology the Gestaltkreis teachings correspond to Jean Piaget's observances {{on the development of}} the early childhood structures of perception, attitude and thought. In continual assimilation and accommodation processes, the motor cognitive and the emotional development work together and determine each other. The development of the senses, the continually differentiating thought and comportment structures, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> space and time are, for Piaget, the prerequisites for developing the ability to symbolize. Compatible with this are the theories of development in depth psychology, where the main emphasis is on early childhood experience with the people with whom one has relationships and where the condition for a healthy development is a happy relationship with the person to whom one relates most closely (Balint, Mahler, Ericson, Winnicott, Kohut and Kernberg).|$|E

25|$|Certain genes {{have been}} {{identified}} with a clear correlation to executive dysfunction and related psychopathologies. According to Friedman et al. (2008), the heritability of executive functions is among the highest of any psychological trait. The dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4) with 7'-repeating polymorphism (7R) has been repeatedly shown to correlate strongly with impulsive response style on psychological tests of executive dysfunction, particularly in clinical ADHD. The catechol-o-methyl transferase gene (COMT) codes for an enzyme that degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters (DA and NE), and its Val158Met polymorphism is linked with the modulation of task-oriented cognition and behavior (including set shifting) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> reward, which are major aspects of executive functioning. COMT is also linked to methylphenidate (stimulant medication) response in children with ADHD. Both the DRD4/7R and COMT/Val158Met polymorphisms are also correlated with executive dysfunction in schizophrenia and schizotypal behaviour.|$|E
25|$|The Conservatives {{served with}} the Liberals in an all-party {{coalition}} government during World War I, and the coalition continued under the Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George (with half of the divided Liberal Party) until 1922. Keohane finds that the Conservatives were bitterly divided before 1914, especially {{on the issue of}} Irish Unionism <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> three consecutive election losses. However the war pulled the party together, allowing it to emphasise patriotism as it found new leadership and worked out it's positions on the Irish question, socialism, electoral reform, and the issue of intervention in the economy. The fresh emphasis on anti-Socialism was its response to the growing strength of the Labour Party. When electoral reform was an issue, it worked to protect their base in rural England. It aggressively sought female voters in the 1920s, often relying on patriotic themes.|$|E
25|$|The DSM has {{attracted}} praise for standardizing psychiatric diagnostic categories and criteria. It has also attracted controversy and criticism.

There are ongoing issues concerning the validity and reliability of the diagnostic categories; the reliance on superficial symptoms; the use of artificial dividing lines between categories and from 'normality'; possible cultural bias; medicalization of human distress and financial conflicts of interest, including with the practice of psychiatrists and with the pharmaceutical industry; political controversies about the inclusion or exclusion of diagnoses from the manual, in general or in regard to specific issues; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> those who are most directly affected by the manual by being diagnosed, including the consumer/survivor movement.
