Using their long forelimbs for leverage, they would have vaulted themselves into the air in <b>a</b> <b>rapid</b> leap. Almost all of the energy would have been generated by the forelimbs.

5|$|The World Health Organization {{has defined}} {{pneumonia}} in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and <b>a</b> <b>rapid</b> respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness. <b>A</b> <b>rapid</b> respiratory rate {{is defined as}} greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old. In children, low oxygen levels and lower chest indrawing are more sensitive than hearing chest crackles with a stethoscope or increased respiratory rate.

5|$|A flight {{behaviour}} {{in which}} a bird rapidly descends with a zig-zagging, side-slipping motion.
