5|$|A {{number of}} sea <b>anemone</b> species are {{commensal}} with other organisms. Certain crabs and hermit crabs seek out sea anemones {{and place them}} on their shells for protection, and fish, shrimps and crabs live among the anemone's tentacles, gaining protection by being {{in close proximity to}} the stinging cells. Some amphipods live inside the coelenteron of the sea <b>anemone.</b> Despite their venomous cells, sea anemones are eaten by fish, starfish, worms, sea spiders and molluscs. The sea slug Aeolidia papillosa feeds on the aggregating <b>anemone</b> (Anthopleura elegantissima), accumulating the nematocysts for its own protection.|$|E
5|$|Since the <b>anemone</b> lacks a rigid skeleton, the {{contractile}} cells pull {{against the}} fluid in the gastrovascular cavity, forming a hydrostatic skeleton. The <b>anemone</b> stabilizes itself by flattening its pharynx which {{acts as a}} valve, keeping the gastrovascular cavity at a constant volume and making it rigid. When the longitudinal muscles relax, the pharynx opens and the cilia lining the siphonoglyphs beat, wafting water inwards and refilling the gastrovascular cavity. In general, the sea <b>anemone</b> inflates its body to extend its tentacles and feed, and deflates it when resting or disturbed. The inflated body {{is also used to}} anchor the animal inside a crevice, burrow or tube.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{plants and}} {{therefore}} incapable of photosynthesis themselves, many sea anemones form an important facultative mutualistic relationship with certain single-celled algae species that {{reside in the}} animals' gastrodermal cells, especially in the tentacles and oral disc. These algae may be either zooxanthellae, zoochlorellae or both. The sea <b>anemone</b> benefits from {{the products of the}} algae's photosynthesis, namely oxygen and food in the form of glycerol, glucose and alanine; the algae in turn are assured a reliable exposure to sunlight and protection from micro-feeders, which the sea anemones actively maintain. The algae also benefit by being protected by the sea anemone's stinging cells, reducing the likelihood of being eaten by herbivores. In the aggregating <b>anemone</b> (Anthopleura elegantissima), the colour of the <b>anemone</b> is largely dependent on the proportions and identities of the zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae present. The hidden <b>anemone</b> (Lebrunia coralligens) has a whorl of seaweed-like pseudotentacles, rich in zooxanthellae, and an inner whorl of tentacles. A daily rhythm sees the pseudotentacles spread widely in the daytime for photosynthesis, but they are retracted at night, at which time the tentacles expand to search for prey.|$|E

One example is the ocellaris clownfish, which dwells among the tentacles of Ritteri sea <b>anemones.</b> The <b>anemones</b> provide the clownfish with protection from their predators (which cannot tolerate the stings of the sea <b>anemone's</b> tentacles), while the fish defend the <b>anemones</b> against butterflyfish (which eat <b>anemones)</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Sea <b>anemones</b> (Order Actiniaria): <b>Anemones,</b> {{especially}} carpet <b>anemones</b> can eat {{fish and}} burn corals to death requiring specific placement for specimens in an aquarium.|$|R
5|$|Ceriantharia {{comprises}} the related tube-dwelling <b>anemones.</b> Tube-dwelling <b>anemones</b> or cerianthids look {{very similar to}} sea <b>anemones,</b> but belong to an entirely different subclass of anthozoans. They are solitary, living buried in soft sediments. Tube <b>anemones</b> live and can withdraw into tubes, which are made of a fibrous material, which is made from secreted mucus and threads of nematocyst-like organelles, known as ptychocysts.|$|R
5|$|Emerald and Seahorse chased <b>Anemone</b> inshore, {{where she}} {{anchored}} {{in shallow water}} out of their reach. When they launched their boats to cut-out <b>Anėmone,</b> her crew cut the anchor cable and their ship drifted on to the shore; as the Frenchmen were attempting to escape along the coast, hostile Arabs captured them and stripped them of their clothes, shooting those who resisted. A heavy surf prevented the British boats from landing, so a midshipman from Emerald, the young Francis Fane, swam ashore with a line and empty cask to rescue the commander and seven others who had escaped naked to the beach. <b>Anėmone</b> had a crew of 60 men {{under the command of}} Enseigne de Vaisseau (Ensign) Garibou, and was also carrying General Camin and Citoyen Valette, Aide-de-Camp to General Napoleon Bonaparte, with dispatches from Toulon. Camin and Valette were among those the Arabs killed. Emerald remained stationed off Alexandria {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{and their}} {{attendant}} <b>anemone</b> fish can make attractive aquarium exhibits {{and both are}} often harvested from the wild as adults or juveniles. These fishing activities significantly impact the populations of anemones and <b>anemone</b> fish by drastically reducing the densities of each in exploited areas. Besides their collection from the wild for use in reef aquaria, sea anemones are also threatened by alterations to their environment. Those living in shallow water coastal locations are affected directly by pollution and siltation, and indirectly by the effect these have on their photosynthetic symbionts and the prey on which they feed.|$|E
5|$|The {{silver birch}} has an open canopy which allows plenty {{of light to}} reach the ground. This allows a variety of mosses, grasses and {{flowering}} plants to grow beneath which in turn attract insects. Flowering plants often found in birch woods include primrose (Primula vulgaris), violet (Viola riviniana), bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), wood <b>anemone</b> (<b>Anemone</b> nemorosa) and wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella). Small shrubs that grow {{on the forest floor}} include blaeberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea).|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the more}} unusual {{relationships}} are those between certain <b>anemones</b> (such as Adamsia, Calliactis and Neoaiptasia) and hermit crabs or snails, and Bundeopsis or Triactis <b>anemones</b> and Lybia boxing crabs. In the former, the <b>anemones</b> live on the shell of the hermit crab or snail. In the latter, the small <b>anemones</b> are carried in the claws of the boxing crab.|$|R
50|$|Ceriantharia {{comprises}} the related tube-dwelling <b>anemones.</b> Tube-dwelling <b>anemones</b> or cerianthids look {{very similar to}} sea <b>anemones,</b> but belong to an entirely different subclass of anthozoans.

5|$|A typical sea <b>anemone</b> is {{a single}} polyp {{attached}} to a hard surface by its base, but some species live in soft sediment and a few float near {{the surface of the}} water. The polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth. The tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey. They are armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells). In many species, additional nourishment comes from a symbiotic relationship with single-celled dinoflagellates, zooxanthellae or with green algae, zoochlorellae, that live within the cells. Some species of sea <b>anemone</b> live in association with hermit crabs, small fish or other animals to their mutual benefit.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoans exhibit {{great powers}} of regeneration; lost parts swiftly regrow {{and the sea}} <b>anemone</b> Aiptasia pallida can be vivisected in the {{laboratory}} {{and then returned to}} the aquarium where it will heal. They are capable of a variety of asexual means of reproduction including fragmentation, longitudinal and transverse fission and budding. Sea anemones for example can crawl across a surface leaving behind them detached pieces of the pedal disc which develop into new clonal individuals. Anthopleura species divide longitudinally, pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and patterning. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing on the column before the sea <b>anemone</b> tears itself apart. Zoanthids are capable of budding off new individuals.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Italy and southwestern Spain, the snakelocks <b>anemone</b> (Anemonia viridis) {{is consumed}} as a delicacy. The whole animal is marinated in vinegar, then coated in a batter {{similar to that}} used to make calamari and deep-fried in olive oil.|$|E
40|$|We have {{undertaken}} {{for the first}} time removal and introduction field experiments with both symbiotic (taken from <b>anemones)</b> and anemone-naïve decapods (taken from somewhere else) and tested defence reactions of putative host <b>anemones.</b> Our findings indicate that decapods go through an individual habituation phase before they become symbionts. Once habituated, they are pro-tected from neighbouring <b>anemones</b> as well. Key words: symbiosis, field experiments, sea <b>anemones,</b> decapod...|$|R

5|$|Most Actiniaria do {{not form}} hard parts {{that can be}} {{recognized}} as fossils, but a few fossils of sea anemones do exist; Mackenzia, from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of Canada, is the oldest fossil identified as a sea <b>anemone.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Nelson {{left for}} Naples on 19 August 1798, {{he left behind}} a squadron—comprising three 74s , , , three frigates Emerald, , and , and the {{corvette}} Bonne Citoyenne—under Samuel Hood to patrol the waters around the port and along the coast. On 2 September, it encountered and destroyed the French aviso <b>Anémone.</b>|$|E
5|$|A hemlock-mixed {{hardwood}} palustrine {{forest is}} present in the vicinity of Scotch Run east of the reservoir on the stream. The forest contains wooded wetlands and vernal pools. Trees inhabiting the forest include white oak, red oak, tulip poplar, yellow birch, eastern hemlock, American beech, and red maple. Other plants in the forest include teaberry, sphagnum moss, wood <b>anemone,</b> false hellebore, skunk cabbage, goldthread, and sensitive fern.|$|E
50|$|Wentletraps {{are usually}} found on sandy bottoms near sea <b>anemones</b> or corals, which {{serve as a}} food source for them. Some species are foragers and search for <b>anemones.</b>|$|R
50|$|The acrorhagi of Actinia bermudensis {{are used}} to {{discourage}} other individuals from moving into the <b>anemone's</b> territory. Intruding <b>anemones</b> are not normally killed but usually retire to a safer place.|$|R
40|$|In many organisms the {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) {{is involved in}} the migration of cells. This thesis investigates the role of the ECM in the Aiptasia-Symbiodinium symbiosis. Commercially available antibodies against mammalian collagen IV, laminin, and beta-integrin successfully label Aiptasia proteins in both symbiotic and aposymbiotic <b>anemones.</b> In an attempt to alter the ECM, <b>anemones</b> were incubated in ethyl- 3, 4 - dihyroxybenzoate (EDHB) and beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN). These <b>anemones</b> presented with distinct morphological differences, however, they did not show notable changes to the ECM as detected by immunofluorescence. EDHB does cause bleaching of symbiotic <b>anemones,</b> possibly by affecting the algal cell wall...|$|R
5|$|A sea <b>anemone</b> {{is capable}} of {{changing}} its shape dramatically. The column and tentacles have longitudinal, transverse and diagonal sheets of muscle and can lengthen and contract, as well as bend and twist. The gullet and mesenteries can evert (turn inside out), or the oral disc and tentacles can retract inside the gullet, with the sphincter closing the aperture; during this process, the gullet folds transversely and water is discharged through the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Five {{species of}} shrubs {{grow in the}} {{vicinity}} of Mahoning Creek, its floodplain, and the nearby slopes: smooth alder, silky dogwood, gray dogwood, spicebush, and American elderberry. 11 herb species also grow in this location. These include skunk cabbage, bloodroot, sensitive fern, sedge, wood <b>anemone,</b> woolgrass, and others. There are also invasive plants such as multiflora rose, Japanese knotweed, and garlic mustard in the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{brooding}} <b>anemone</b> (Epiactis prolifera) is gynodioecious, starting life as {{a female}} and later becoming hermaphroditic, so that populations consist of females and hermaphrodites. As a female, the eggs can develop parthenogenetically into female offspring without fertilisation, and as a hermaphrodite, the eggs are routinely self-fertilised. The larvae emerge from the anemone's mouth and tumble down the column, lodging in a fold near the pedal disc. Here they develop and grow, remaining for about three months before crawling off to start independent lives.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoa is {{included}} within the phylum Cnidaria, {{which also includes}} the jellyfish, box jellies and parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa. The two main subclasses of Anthozoa are the Hexacorallia, members of which have six-fold symmetry and includes the stony corals, sea <b>anemones,</b> tube <b>anemones</b> and zoanthids; and the Octocorallia, which have eight-fold symmetry and includes the soft corals and gorgonians (sea pens, sea fans and sea whips), and sea pansies. The smaller subclass, Ceriantharia, consists of the tube-dwelling <b>anemones.</b>|$|R
50|$|Anemonefish {{and their}} host <b>anemones</b> are found on coral reefs and face similar {{environmental}} issues. Like corals, <b>anemones</b> contain intracellular endosymbionts, zooxanthellae, and can suffer from bleaching due to triggers such as increased water temperature or acidification. Local populations and genetic diversity remain vulnerable to {{high level of}} exploitation of these species and their host <b>anemones</b> by the global ornamental fish trade. This species was not evaluated in the 2012 release of the IUCN Red List.|$|R

5|$|The {{collecting}} trip {{had been}} very successful: they catalogued over 500 species of the fauna of {{the shores of the}} Gulf; recorded a species of brittle star, Ophiophragmus marginatus, last recorded nearly 100 years earlier; and discovered about 50 new species. Three species of sea <b>anemone</b> they discovered were named for them by Dr. Oscar Calgren at the Lund University's Department of Zoology in Sweden: Palythoa rickettsii, Isometridium rickettsi, and Phialoba steinbecki.|$|E
5|$|The lagoons {{behind the}} shingle beach at Salthouse and Cley are salty {{due to the}} {{percolation}} of seawater through the bank. These saline lagoons may cover mud, firm sand or submerged vegetation, and hold some rare and threatened invertebrates including the starlet sea <b>anemone,</b> lagoon sand shrimp, Atlantic ditch shrimp, and lagoon cockle. These marshes are the only reliable UK site for the water beetle yellow pogonus, and even here it is localised and hard to find.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some species}} of sea <b>anemone</b> burrow in soft sediment, the {{majority}} are mainly sessile, attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc, and tend {{to stay in the}} same spot for weeks or months at a time. They can move however, being able to creep around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is so slow as to be almost imperceptible to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards the front edge, which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; walking is by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like a caterpillar, attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the sea onion <b>anemone</b> inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by the waves and currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a free-living stage that aids in their dispersal.|$|E
40|$|Cnidarians, in general, are {{long-lived}} {{organisms and}} hence may repeatedly encounter common pathogens during their lifespans. It remains unknown whether these early diverging animals possess {{some type of}} immunological reaction that strengthens the defense response upon repeated infections, such as that described in more evolutionary derived organisms. Here we show results that sea <b>anemones</b> that had previously encountered a pathogen under sub-lethal conditions had a higher survivorship during a subsequently lethal challenge than naive <b>anemones</b> that encountered the pathogen for the first time. <b>Anemones</b> subjected to the lethal challenge two and four weeks after the sub-lethal exposure presented seven- and five-fold increases in survival, respectively, compared to the naive <b>anemones.</b> However, <b>anemones</b> challenged six weeks after the sub-lethal exposure showed no increase in survivorship. We argue that this short-lasting priming of the defense response could be ecologically relevant if pathogen encounters are restricted to short seasons characterized by high stress. Furthermore, we discovered significant changes in proteomic profiles between naive sea <b>anemones</b> and those primed after pathogen exposure suggesting a clear molecular signature associated with immunological priming in cnidarians. Our findings reveal that immunological priming may have evolved much earlier in {{the tree of life}} than previously thought...|$|R
40|$|Heteractis crispa (Ehrenberg, 1834) {{is highly}} sought after {{in the marine}} {{aquarium}} trade due to its association with anemonefish. Individuals have been sourced entirely from the wild, adversely impacting populations. This study {{presents the results of}} a 12 -wk feeding experiment using 36 juvenile <b>anemones</b> grown in captivity since fertilization. The <b>anemones</b> were divided among three treatments (unfed, fed weekly, and fed three times weekly), and changes in size (wet weight, pedal disc, and oral disc diameter) were recorded. <b>Anemones</b> fed once {{or three times a week}} did not differ significantly in size, indicating that feeding more than weekly did not increase growth. Although unfed <b>anemones</b> in some cases showed significant growth over time, presumably deriving nutritional benefits from their zooxanthellae, they grew less than the fed <b>anemones.</b> The findings of the present study may have important implications for the conservation of this species if captive breeding can be used to supply the aquarium trade or restock depleted reefs...|$|R
