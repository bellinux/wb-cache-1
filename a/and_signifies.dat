The ascending Christ may be carrying a resurrection banner or make a sign of benediction with his right hand. The blessing gesture by Christ with his right hand is directed towards the earthly group below him <b>and</b> <b>signifies</b> that he is blessing the entire Church. In the left hand, he may be holding a Gospel or a scroll, signifying teaching and preaching.|$|E

Skaill on the east coast is from the Norse skáli and suggests an important farm on good fertile land that was associated with several smaller tunships. The Bay of London also has Norse origins, lund-inn meaning [...] "woodland", although this is no longer an apt description for this largely treeless landscape. Old Norse lundi means [...] "puffin", which creatures may once have nested in sandy land {{at the back of the}} bay.|$|E

2500|$|Chad {{was one of}} four brothers, all {{active in}} the Anglo-Saxon church. The others were Cedd, Cynibil and Caelin. Chad seems to have been Cedd's junior, {{arriving}} on the political scene about ten years after Cedd. It is reasonable to suppose that Chad and his brothers were drawn from the Northumbrian nobility. They certainly had close connections throughout the Northumbrian ruling class. However, the name Chad is actually of British Celtic, rather than Anglo-Saxon origin. It is an element found in the personal names of many Welsh princes and nobles of the period <b>and</b> <b>signifies</b> [...] "battle".

2500|$|The {{rattlesnake}} symbol {{was first}} officially {{adopted by the}} Continental Congress in 1778 when it approved the design for the official Seal of the War Office (at that time and for many years thereafter, the War Office was a term associated with the Headquarters of the Army). At the top center of the Seal is a rattlesnake holding a banner which says: [...] "This We'll Defend". According to the US Army's Institute of Heraldry, [...] "'This We'll Defend,' on a scroll held by the rattlesnake is a symbol depicted on some American colonial flags <b>and</b> <b>signifies</b> the Army's constant readiness to defend and preserve the United States.' This design of the War Office Seal was carried forward—with some minor modifications—into the subsequent designs for the War Department's Seal, and the Department of the Army's Seal, Emblem and Flag. As such, the rattlesnake symbol has been in continuous official use by the US Army for over 236 years.|$|E
