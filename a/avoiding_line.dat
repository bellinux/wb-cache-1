25|$|The GWR {{acquired}} the Devon and Somerset Railway in 1901. On 1 July 1905 an <b>avoiding</b> <b>line</b> was opened at Barnstaple, which allowed through trains to Ilfracombe to run {{directly to the}} LSWR station without having to reverse in the D terminus. During the 1930s the line carried heavy traffic on summer weekends and automatic token equipment was installed to allow trains to pass token exchange points at higher speeds.|$|E
25|$|From 1847 to 1977 Wimborne {{was served}} by a two-platform railway station. The station was built for the Southampton and Dorchester Railway, later part of the London and South Western Railway. It was {{expanded}} when the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway was constructed between Bath and Poole. Wimborne {{was used as a}} reversing point on the Somerset and Dorset, but its importance was reduced when an <b>avoiding</b> <b>line</b> was built from Bailey Gate to Broadstone Junction. The station had a large goods yard, the site of which is used for the weekly Wimborne Market. The station was closed to passengers in 1964 and sundries (parcels and light goods) in 1966, {{as a result of the}} Beeching Axe programme. The final goods trains ran in May 1977.|$|E

It is used for stabling, maintenance and repair of the Metrocar fleet. It can be accessed by trains from either east or west, there is also a depot <b>avoiding</b> <b>line</b> running from east to west, which isn't used in public service.|$|E

2500|$|The {{loop line}} was singled on 31 January 1972. Most of the sidings were removed {{at this time}} and the bay {{platform}} (Platform 3) was reduced {{to the status of}} a siding. [...] Two signal boxes – one {{at each end of the}} station – were closed and new colour light signals provided. [...] These are controlled from a Panel Signal Box at Bristol Temple Meads, but an emergency panel is situated in the Station Supervisors office that can be used to control the line from Puxton Signal Box to Uphill Junction along both the loop line and <b>avoiding</b> <b>line</b> when there are problems with the normal signalling system.|$|E
2500|$|The Great Eastern Railway {{wanted to}} build a line from Cambridge to York, which would have passed through Sleaford and Bourne, but Parliament would not allow it. The GNR {{submitted}} a proposal for a line between Bourne and Sleaford, which, after amendments to the route, was approved in 1865 and opened in 1872. Next came the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway which opened from Spalding through Sleaford to Ruskington and from there to Lincoln in 1882. The Sleaford company Kirk and Parry built the line, while the Ruskington-based builders Pattinson's constructed the new stations along the route. The line was designed to transport freight, which necessitated an <b>avoiding</b> <b>line</b> around Sleaford; Sleaford station was also extended. The last new line through Sleaford ran to RAF Cranwell and opened in 1916.|$|E

50|$|By 1947 {{the modern}} {{distinction}} between long-distance and purely local passenger trains had arisen. By {{this time the}} west of England trains ran over the route via Westbury <b>avoiding</b> <b>line</b> or station, and Frome <b>avoiding</b> <b>line.</b> There were through express trains from London to Weymouth via Westbury and Castle Cary, and an enhanced service from Bristol or Cardiff to Portsmouth Harbour via Westbury and Salisbury.|$|E

These demonstrated that a broken SWER conductor can short to ground across a resistance similar to the circuit's normal load; in that particular case, a tree. This can cause large currents without a ground-fault indication. This can present a danger in fire-prone areas where a conductor may snap and current may arc through trees or dry grass.|$|R

On the other hand, in the Four Knights move order, White acquires the extra option of 6.Nxc6 bxc6 7.e5 Nd5 8.Ne4, so White is not obliged to enter the Sveshnikov.|$|R

50|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 May 1984 a {{freightliner}} train was descending from Shap on the main line, and became divided. The front portion of the train continued, but the rear portion slowed but then also continued by gravity. Entering the Carlisle complex it was diverted on to the goods <b>avoiding</b> <b>lines.</b> These were sharply curved and the train portion became derailed, causing considerable damage in the process. The route was closed by the damage caused, and in December 1985 the decision was taken not to restore the route, and accordingly it was permanently closed. Signalling changes at Citadel station were made to facilitate all traffic passing through it.|$|R
40|$|The {{squeezing}} {{properties of}} a cavity Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) system with an added Kerr effect-like nonlinearity are studied {{as a function}} of the intra-cavity photon number. The competition between the second and the third order non-linearities shifts the Hopf bifurcation of the standard SHG towards higher intra-cavity energies eventually completely stabilizing the system. Remarkably, the noise suppression is at the same time strongly enhanced, so that almost perfect squeezing is obtained for arbitrarily large intra-cavity photon numbers. Possible experimental implementations are finally discussed.

There was also a loop that allowed southbound trains from Lincoln Central to travel westwards before turning onto the Newark line, along with a short portion of the old <b>avoiding</b> <b>line</b> retained to allow through running from the Gainsborough direction towards Newark & vice versa (this has been mostly used for diversionary purposes when the ECML is blocked by engineering work).|$|E

50|$|When {{the cut-off}} line, from Reading to Taunton via Westbury, was opened, it ran through Westbury and Frome stations.

The Developments (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act 1929, was passed to stimulate employment and to encourage industrial development, and the GWR obtained financial assistance from this source to build <b>avoiding</b> <b>lines,</b> by-passing each station.|$|R
