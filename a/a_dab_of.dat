2500|$|Coated with thickly layered vocal harmonies, [...] "Shadows" [...] was co-written and {{produced}} by Propellerheads' Alex Gifford. Rolling Stone said the following of the track: [...] " [...] keeps a dry funk drumbeat, <b>a</b> <b>dab</b> <b>of</b> piano chords, some low clarinet lines and, finally, {{a swarm of}} seraphic, multitracked voices; it's {{one of the many}} songs on the album that build up to moments of cinematic perfection, in which your goose bumps are exactly the ones Wainwright intended." [...] The programmed beats on [...] "The Tower of Learning" [...] were contributed by contemporary composer Damien LeGassick.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} structures had {{roofs of}} thatch or earth supported by flat poles. Tejas (roof tiles) were utilized in later construction (beginning around 1790) {{to replace the}} flammable thatch. The semicircular tiles consisted of clay molded over a section of a log was which well-sanded to prevent the clay from sticking. According to the accounts of Father Estévan Tapís of Mission Santa Barbara, some thirty-two Native American males were required to make 500 tiles each day, while the women carried sand and straw to the pits. The mixture was first worked in pits under the hoofs of animals, then placed on a flat board and fashioned to the correct thickness. Sheets of clay were then placed over the logs and cut the desired to size: they ranged in length from , and tapered from [...] in width. After trimming, the tiles were dried in the sun, then placed in ovens and burned until they took on a reddish-brown coloring. The quality of the tiles varied greatly among the missions {{due to differences in}} soil types from one site to another. Legend has it that the first tiles were made at Mission San Luis Obispo, but Father Maynard Geiger (the Franciscan historian and biographer of Junípero Serra) claims that Mission San Antonio de Padua was actually the first to use them. Aside from their obvious advantage over straw roofs in terms of fire retardance, the impermeable surface also protected the adobe walls below from the damaging effects of rain. The original tiles [...] were secured with <b>a</b> <b>dab</b> <b>of</b> adobe and were held in place because of their shape, being tapered at the upper end so they could not slide off one another.|$|E

And you might as well bring me an oyster or two on the half shell, and a mouthful of soup (mock-turtle, consomme, anything), and perhaps you might fetch along <b>a</b> <b>dab</b> <b>of</b> fish, and a little peck of Stilton, and a grape, or a walnut." ...|$|E

6000|$|When supper was announced, Polly {{happened}} to be talking, or trying to talk, {{to one of the}} [...] "poky" [...] gentlemen whom Fan had introduced. He took Miss Milton down, of course, put her in a corner, and having served her to <b>a</b> <b>dab</b> <b>of</b> ice and one macaroon, he devoted himself to his own supper with such interest, that Polly would have fared badly, if Tom had not come and rescued her.|$|E
6000|$|At six-thirty, sharp to the minute, he {{was back}} with a larger tray.

The breakfast was simple yet fairly substantial--more coffee, a half grape-fruit, two soft-boiled eggs made ready in a glass with <b>a</b> <b>dab</b> <b>of</b> butter and piping hot, and a sliver of bacon, not over-cooked, that he knew was of his own raising and curing.|$|E
6000|$|His {{blood was}} up. His danger only nerved him to action, so he says. So he planted <b>a</b> <b>dab</b> <b>of</b> {{vermilion}} in his creature's mouth.

And then--according to Harringay--there began a very remarkable struggle, Harringay splashing away with the red paint, and the picture wriggling about and wiping it off {{as fast as he}} put it on. [...] "Two masterpieces," [...] said the demon. [...] "Two indubitable masterpieces for a Chelsea artist's soul. It's a bargain?" [...] Harringay replied with the paint brush.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are the tales, of course," [...] {{said the}} Admiral, shrugging his shoulders; [...] "and some of them, I don't deny, on {{evidence}} as decent as one ever gets for such things. Someone saw a blaze hereabout, don't you know, {{as he walked}} home through a wood; someone keeping sheep on the uplands inland thought he saw a flame hovering over Pendragon Tower.

I wasn't asking you for half your fortune, nor even <b>a</b> <b>dab</b> <b>of</b> it, but if your life wasn't worth a few hundred pounds--you, with all that money--well, it wasn't worth saving.

50|$|Manet {{may have}} based the {{painting}} on observations at the Café de la Nouvelle Athènes on the Place Pigalle in Paris. However, the background - the decorative grille and its gold frame - {{does not match}} other depictions of the café, and suggests the painting was made in Manet’s studio, where he {{is known to have}} had a café-style marble table on iron legs.

60|$|But {{she carried}} me {{to a nice}} little room only three flights up in quite a decent street. And she {{put me in the}} window, of course.

Not a single lobster, nor so much as one bottle of champagne. The Carruthers comedy team had both every evening, except now and then when they took a notion for pig's knuckle and kraut.|$|R
