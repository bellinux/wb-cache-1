25|$|Nurses are {{required}} to have a critical care background; physicians are typically specialists in some field of medical specialty, often internists, surgeons or anaesthetists, although this background is not strictly required (though in some regione anaesthetists are the only physicians on ambulances or fly-cars).

25|$|Opportunities for leisure {{activities}} increased dramatically as real wages {{continued to grow}} <b>and</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> work continued to decline. In urban areas, the nine-hour workday became increasingly the norm; the 1874 Factory Act limited the workweek to 56.5 hours, encouraging the movement toward an eventual eight-hour workday. Helped by the Bank Holiday Act of 1871, which created a number of fixed holidays, a system of routine annual vacations came into play, starting with white-collar workers and moving into the working-class. Some 200 seaside resorts emerged thanks to cheap hotels and inexpensive railway fares, widespread banking holidays and the fading of many religious prohibitions against secular activities on Sundays. Middle-class Victorians used the train services to visit the seaside, Large numbers travelling to quiet fishing villages such as Worthing, Brighton, Morecambe and Scarborough began turning them into major tourist centres, and people like Thomas Cook saw tourism and even overseas travel as viable businesses.|$|E

500|$|One {{criticism}} to the UCS {{study is}} that the analysis was made using average emissions rates across regions instead of marginal generation {{at different times of}} the day. The former approach {{does not take into account}} the generation mix within interconnected electricity markets and shifting load profiles throughout the day. An analysis by three economist affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), published in November 2014, developed a methodology to estimate marginal emissions of electricity demand that vary by location and time of day across the United States. The marginal analysis, applied to plug-in electric vehicles, found that the emissions of charging PEVs vary by region <b>and</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the day. In some regions, such as the Western U.S. and Texas, [...] emissions per mile from driving PEVs are less than those from driving a hybrid car. However, in other regions, such as the Upper Midwest, charging during the recommended hours of midnight to 4 a.m. implies that PEVs generate more emissions per mile than the average car currently on the road. The results show a fundamental tension between electricity load management and environmental goals as the hours when electricity is the least expensive to produce tend to be the hours with the greatest emissions. This occurs because coal-fired units, which have higher emission rates, are most commonly used to meet base-level and off-peak electricity demand; while natural gas units, which have relatively low emissions rates, are often brought online to meet peak demand.|$|E

This week alone, NME has spent at least two days having our minds freaked on by its space funk swirl." [...] Pitchforks Evan Minsker labeled it a [...] "Best New Track" [...] and wrote that [...] "the song's a 10-minute R event, traveling from club banger ancient Egypt ('send the cheetahs to the tomb') to the slow jam strip club('she's workin' at the Pyramid tonight'). It's a journey well-suited to Ocean's smooth croon." [...] The publication's Ryan Dombal commented, [...] "essentially reincarnates {{one of the most}} storied female rulers in history as a six-inch-heeled woman of the night. However, the song doesn't read as an indictment of the last 2,000 years as much as yet another attempt to cleverly level the playing field." [...] The Telegraphs Neil McCormick stated that the track was the [...] "real miracle of the album", noting that while Ocean [...] "can embark on something as flamboyant as Pyramids - a 10-minute, tempo-shifting, minor-chord narrative of Egyptian queens and Las Vegas strippers, marrying Tangerine Dream sequencers and a jazzy John Mayer guitar solo to a rapturous slow jam – and make it all seem to make sense." ...|$|E
