THSRC informed the High Speed Rail Police Division, which later boarded the train when it stopped at Hsinchu station. The traffic control center decided to evacuate passengers after the train stopped at Taoyuan station at 9:45 <b>am.</b> <b>More</b> than 600 people were asked to disembark and continue their journey on another train.

5|$|In LMP2, Bird and Julien Canal {{took the}} fastest two-lap average time of 2:07.761; Canal pushed hard on new tyres during his second timed run having disliked his {{previous}} attempt. The pair were two-tenths {{of a second}} faster than the second-place qualifiers, Howson and Lapierre, and held the class pole position until Canal's lap. Team SARD Morand's No. 43 car took third in the category, while the second G-Drive Racing entry was fourth, with fifth-placed qualifier Tincknell recording the session's best class individual lap time. Richie Stanaway and Rees, competing in the No. 99 Aston Martin, were the fastest LMGTE Pro qualifiers with a two-lap average time of 2:16.840. Gianmaria Bruni was 0.070 seconds off the Aston Martin's pace, and started from {{second place in the}} category, displacing Turner and Mücke from the position. Turner's fastest lap was invalidated after he went off the track and was required to set another time. James Calado and Davide Rigon secured fourth in AF Corse's No. 71 Ferrari with Sørensen and Nygaard rounding out the top five. Aston Martin's No. 98 entry driven by Paul Dalla Lana and Lamy took pole position in LMGTE <b>Am,</b> <b>more</b> than a second faster than the No. 50 Larbre Compétition Corvette of Paolo Ruberti and Gianluca Roda.|$|E

Except for the guns which were unable to cross the stream, Heidenreich's troops moved east and seized Marchais at about 11:00 <b>am.</b> <b>More</b> French artillery having arrived in the interval, Napoleon ordered Ricard to attack Marchais at noon. A bitter struggle for Marchais raged for two hours, with the Russians retaining control of the village. Napoleon ordered an artillery bombardment {{while he waited for}} Michel's Old Guard division to march forward from Montmirail. At 2:00 pm the emperor ordered an attack on Sacken's left flank. Four of Friant's Old Guard battalions marched west along the highway toward Haute-Épine dairy farm, supported on their right by seven squadrons of Gardes d'Honneur. At the same time, Claude-Étienne Guyot led four Guard cavalry squadrons around the Russian left flank. The combined attacks broke Sacken's first line and compelled him to send his second line into action while moving his cavalry to the left to get in contact with Yorck's Prussians.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{signing with}} Arsenal, club manager Wenger likened the player to former club player Patrick Vieira. Wenger {{compared}} the two {{primarily because of}} the similarities between each player's physical appearance and positional preference. While the two are similar in appearance, Diaby has admitted that there are huge differences, stating, [...] "I think maybe I <b>am</b> <b>more</b> attack-minded, a more technical player," [...] and, [...] "Vieira is much more aggressive. He makes more of a physical impact in a game, in midfield. He is amazing. I don’t think I have this quality yet. I think I can develop in that way but he is much stronger." [...] In 2009, Wenger echoed Diaby's sentiments, stating, [...] "I believe Vieira was more of a passer of the ball. Diaby is more of a dribbler, more offensive and makes more penetrating runs. Vieira was more of a constructor. They have a similar elegance and type of play but are not completely comparable".|$|E

500|$|Keats {{was exposed}} to a few sources of the Psyche myth. His {{contemporary}} sources for the myth included Lempriere's Classical Dictionary and Mary Tighe's Psyche, an 1805 work that Keats read {{as a child and}} returned to in 1818. Keats wrote to his brother George, just a few months before writing [...] "Ode to Psyche", {{to say that he was}} no longer delighted by Tighe's writing. Dissatisfied, he turned to Apuleius's Golden Ass, translated by William Adlington in 1566, and read through the earlier version of the Cupid and Psyche myth. After reading the work and realizing that the myth was established during the twilight of Roman mythology, Keats wrote to George: [...] "You must recollect that Psyche was not embodied as a goddess before the time of Apuleius the Platonist who lived after the Augustan age, and consequently the Goddess was never worshipped or sacrificed to with any of the ancient fervour—and perhaps never thought of in the old religion—I <b>am</b> <b>more</b> orthodox than to let a heathen Goddess be so neglected." ...|$|E
500|$|Money was {{borrowed}} from Britain {{to fund the}} state's programs and at an unprecedented rate. Over £230 million was extended in loans from the City of London to state and Commonwealth treasuries during the 1920s. A further £140 million arrived through private investment. Bruce's plan for Australian economic development needed a much stronger role for the Commonwealth government than had been traditionally accepted.

All our problems are common problems. None can be prosperous unless all are prospering.

500|$|Returning to the U.S., {{the newlyweds}} settled in a New York City {{house that was}} {{provided}} by Franklin's mother, {{as well as in}} a second residence at the family's estate overlooking the Hudson River in Hyde Park, New York. From the beginning, Eleanor had a contentious relationship with her controlling mother-in-law. The townhouse that Sara gave to Eleanor and Franklin was connected to her own residence by sliding doors, and Sara ran both households in the decade after the marriage. Early on, Eleanor had a breakdown in which she explained to Franklin that [...] "I did not like to live in a house which was not in any way mine, one that I had done nothing about and which did not represent the way I wanted to live", but little changed. Sara also sought to control the raising of her grandchildren, and Eleanor reflected later that [...] "Franklin's children were more my mother-in-law's children than they were mine".

500|$|Corzine {{continued}} {{to serve in}} the U.S. Senate while running for governor, which ensured that he could resign from the Senate and appoint a Democrat as his successor if he won and allowed him to retain his Senate seat if he lost. Speculation was that he would appoint a Democrat from one of the congressional districts in New Jersey, perhaps Congressmen Rob Andrews, Rush Holt, or Frank Pallone. Corzine, once he was Governor-Elect, said on November 11, 2005, that he was strongly appointing State Senator Nia Gill to fill his vacant seat in the United States Senate. Corzine said about Gill that she was [...] "an extraordinarily capable woman." [...] Gill for her part told the Associated Press [...] "I have the qualifications. If I am chosen by Jon, I <b>am</b> <b>more</b> than qualified to rise to the occasion." [...] He strongly hinted he might appoint Governor Richard Codey although on November 23, 2005, Codey announced that he was not interested in pursuing the seat.

In the same blog entry, he also said [...] "I am not a believer, not an atheist, not an agnostic. I am still awake at night, asking how? I <b>am</b> <b>more</b> content with the question than I would be with an answer." [...] In March 2013, he wrote: [...] "I support freedom of choice. My choice is to not support abortion, except in cases of a clear-cut choice between the lives of the mother and child. A child conceived through incest or rape is innocent and deserves the right to be born." [...] He also stated: [...] "I consider myself Catholic, lock, stock and barrel, with this technical loophole: I cannot believe in God. I refuse to call myself an atheist however, because that indicates too great a certainty about the unknowable." ...|$|E

She described her experience as being held in a [...] "small neat parlour". However, Mr Potter's private madhouse was not [...] "homely", and Smart's treatments were far worse, as he describes: [...] "For they work on me with their harping-irons, which is a barbarous instrument, because I <b>am</b> <b>more</b> unguarded than others" [...] (Jubilate Agno B 129). Smart was left alone for four years, except for his cat Jeoffry and the occasional gawker who would come to see those deemed mad. Piozzi described Smart's general situation: [...] "He was both a wit and a scholar, and visited as such while under confinement for MADNESS." [...] It is very possible that he felt [...] "homeless" [...] during his confinement and surely felt that he was in a [...] "limbo... between public and private space" [...] from being watched by outsiders.|$|E
