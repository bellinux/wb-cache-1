2500|$|The Sullivan scholar Gervase Hughes characterised Sir Roderic's song [...] "When {{the night}} wind howls" [...] as [...] "unquestionably the finest piece of {{descriptive}} music that Sullivan ever wrote, {{worthy of a}} place beside Schubert's Erlkönig, Wagner's overture to The Flying Dutchman, and well above Saint-Saëns' Danse macabre, {{all of which are}} tone-paintings in a similar colour. Although the vocal score gives not a hint of the uncanny brilliance of the orchestration, it demonstrates the sure footholds by which the music in a round dozen bars finds its way from D minor to <b>A</b> <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> and back and the shattering impact of the fortissimo chorus entry at an interrupted cadence on the chord of B flat major. The progressions that follow look to be unusual, but if we study them carefully we realise that here Sullivan is not feeling his way in unfamiliar territory. Rather we may find in these few bars an apotheosis of his matured harmonic resource." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1807, {{despite his}} earlier {{affiliation}} with Marie Antoinette, Dussek returned to Paris in the employ of Talleyrand, the powerful French foreign minister. [...] Having no doubt made the acquaintance of Sébastien Érard in London, he became {{closely associated with}} the Érard brothers' piano-making activities, signing an Érard grand piano of 1808 still to be seen at Talleyrand's château at Valençay and giving the first public performance on their new stirrup-action grand in 1810. He wrote a powerful sonata (Sonata in <b>A</b> <b>flat</b> <b>major,</b> Op. 64, C 221) called Le Retour à Paris (The Return to Paris). This imposing sonata also received the nickname Plus Ultra in heated response to a piano sonata by Joseph Woelfl, said to be the last word in pianistic difficulties, entitled Ne Plus Ultra. The remainder of his life he spent performing, teaching and composing in Prussia and France. His personal beauty had faded and he became grossly fat, so much so that he had a curve cut into his dining table and was eventually unable to reach the piano keyboard. He also developed a fondness for strong drink which probably hastened his death. Dussek died on March 20, 1812, in Saint-Germain-en-Laye.|$|E

5000|$|The third {{movement}} (presto) {{begins with}} the three notes of the C minor triad in <b>a</b> C-G-C-E <b>flat</b> pattern. This upwards moving passage then moves down from E flat to C then repeats the opening pattern with different notes, D-G-D-F and then descends from F to D and then returns to E flat. In order to complete this opening passage there is a downwards scale from E- flat to C and then leave the opening {{in a state of}} resolution, there is a final four note pattern, B natural-C-D and finally to G, the dominant. This is then repeated an octave lower. Throughout this, the left hand is playing short, staccato accompanying quarter notes whereas the right, which was discussed above, is playing eighth note tuplet. After the opening passage is complete, there is the a series of broken C major chords one octave above from where the opening passage ended. Each of these broken chords are repeated twice, modulating from C major to F minor to B <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> and finally, to E <b>flat</b> <b>major.</b> Once reaching E <b>flat</b> <b>major,</b> the relative major of C minor, there is a downwards scale continuing until reaching G, an octave lower. From this point, a new pattern emerges, consisting of the three notes: F, G, <b>A</b> <b>flat</b> and B flat. The notes are arranged in <b>a</b> G-A flat-B <b>flat</b> F-G-A flat pattern, which is repeated twice. After this pattern, <b>a</b> broken E <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> tonic chord is played, followed by another downwards scale once again beginning on C and continuing to a low F. Following the scale is a final closing pattern, one which is not heard in again in the piece. The closing bar ends with <b>a</b> broken E <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> chord beginning on G followed by the three notes C - <b>A</b> <b>flat</b> - G and closes in <b>a</b> E <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> cadence.

2500|$|Ludwig van Beethoven was {{familiar}} with fugal writing from childhood, as {{an important part of}} his training was playing from The Well-Tempered Clavier. During his early career in Vienna, Beethoven attracted notice for his performance of these fugues. There are fugal sections in Beethoven's early piano sonatas, and fugal writing {{is to be found in}} the second and fourth movements of the Eroica Symphony (1805). Beethoven incorporated fugues in his sonatas, and reshaped the episode's purpose and compositional technique for later generations of composers. Nevertheless, fugues did not take on a truly central role in Beethoven's work until his [...] "late period." [...] The finale of Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata contains a fugue, which was practically unperformed until the late 19th century, due to its tremendous technical difficulty and length. The last movement of his Cello Sonata, Op. 102 No. 2 is a , and there are fugal passages in the last movements of his piano sonatas in A major Op.101 and in <b>A</b> <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> Op..

50|$|Two {{complete}} autograph manuscripts of {{the symphony}} exist, dating from 1887 and 1890 respectively. More sketches exist from {{all phases of}} work on this symphony than for most of Bruckner's works. For example, thanks to the sketches, {{we can see the}} evolution of the opening theme. Part scores show that the tonal ambiguity of the symphony's opening was not how Bruckner originally envisaged the main theme: the rhythm was to fit an arpeggiated contour in C minor. The final opening is much less defined and hovers in more of <b>a</b> B <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> region, though it suggests several keys.|$|R

40|$|We compare stellar orbits in {{an early}} (NGC 4314) and a late-type barred galaxy (NGC 1073). We find that these bars are cold {{in the sense that}} the {{majority}} of stars can be described as being nearby to periodic orbits. We place limits of (65 km/s) ^ 2 and (50 km/s) ^ 2 on the components of the diagonalized velocity dispersion ellipsoid matrix for stars in the bars of NGC 4314 and NGC 1073 respectively. Both bars end near the inner 4 : 1 Lindblad (ultraharmonic) resonance. We conjecture that a large class of bars end near this resonance. The morphology of the bars depends on the strength of the 4 : 1 resonance, which is strong in the early-type barred galaxy and weak in the other.

5000|$|The {{main section}} of [...] "Don't Leave Me Now", {{recorded}} with synthesizer bass, organ, piano, and a delay-treated guitar, does not adhere to one single key, but rather cycles slowly through four dissonant and seemingly-unrelated chords, for two measures of each: An E augmented chord, followed by <b>a</b> D <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> seventh chord, <b>a</b> B <b>flat</b> dominant seventh chord with a suspended second, {{followed by a}} G Major chord, which, after one bar, augments its fifth, {{before returning to the}} beginning of the progression. The first three chords all sustain the notes G♯/A♭ and C, and this interval is then lowered chromatically by one semitone for the conclusion on G Major. Furthermore, the roots of this chord progression (E, D♭, B♭, and G) outline the intervals of a diminished seventh chord. The roots relate to each other as a pair of tritones - the E and B♭ form one tritone, and the D♭ and G form the other. Musicologist and author Phil Rose described this section of the song as [...] "entirely non-functional harmonically" [...] and stated that [...] "Most of the time when a phrase ends, Waters is either singing one of the most dissonant notes in the accompanying chord, or a non-chord tone." [...] There is no percussion, and the tempo is very slow.|$|R

25|$|The most {{irreparable}} type of desertification is the salinization {{process that}} forms marshy salt <b>flats.</b> <b>A</b> <b>major</b> factor {{that contributes to}} these conditions is inefficient use of water because of weak regulation and failure to charge for water that is used. Efficiency in application of water to the fields is low, but the main problem is leakage in main and secondary canals, especially Turkmenistan's main canal, the Karakum Canal. Nearly half of the canal's water seeps out into lakes and salt swamps along its path. Excessive irrigation brings salts to the surface, forming salt marshes that dry into unusable clay flats. In 1989 Turkmenistan's Institute for Desert Studies claimed that the area of such flats had reached 10,000km².|$|R
