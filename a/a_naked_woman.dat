5|$|In Helena, Montana, Richie Szalay is {{chasing a}} {{spaceship}}. As the spaceship stops, it dumps <b>a</b> <b>naked</b> <b>woman</b> and cloaks itself. The woman is later {{revealed to be}} Theresa Hoese, who was abducted {{the same time as}} Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) visit Hoese in the hospital to get information about Mulder's whereabouts.|$|E
5|$|According to Voigt, the coven {{placed an}} {{emphasis}} on practical magic rather than worship, theology, ethics, or ritual, and were eclectic in their practices, mixing Huna with forms of American folk magic. She noted {{that they did not}} worship a goddess but held to a belief in a god who was opposed to the God of Christianity. Moreover she claimed that they met together for both outdoor and indoor meetings, according to the phases of the moon. According to Voigt's account, Anderson also claimed that on occasion, the coven used <b>a</b> <b>naked</b> <b>woman</b> as their altar, and that the group disbanded after World War II broke out.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Dorothy appears naked outside was {{inspired}} by a real-life experience Lynch had during childhood when he and his brother saw <b>a</b> <b>naked</b> <b>woman</b> walking down a neighborhood street at night. The experience was so traumatic to the young Lynch that it made him cry, and he had never forgotten it. Principal photography of Blue Velvet began in February 1986 and completed in April. The film was shot at EUE/Screen Gems studio in Wilmington, North Carolina, which also provided the exterior scenes of Lumberton. The scene with a raped and battered Dorothy proved to be particularly challenging. Several townspeople arrived to watch the filming with picnic baskets and rugs, against the wishes of Rossellini and Lynch. However, they continued filming as normal, and when Lynch yelled cut, the townspeople had left. As a result, police told Lynch they were no longer permitted to shoot in any public areas of Wilmington.|$|E

25|$|In July 1974, Flynt first {{published}} Hustler {{as a step}} forward from the Hustler Newsletter, which was advertising for his businesses. The magazine struggled for the first year, partly because many distributors and wholesalers refused to handle it as its nude photos became increasingly graphic. It targeted working-class men and grew from a shaky start to a peak circulation of around three million. The publication of nude paparazzi pictures of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in August 1975 was a major coup. Hustler has often featured more explicit photographs than comparable magazines and has contained depictions of women that some find demeaning, such as <b>a</b> <b>naked</b> <b>woman</b> in a meat grinder or presented as a dog on a leash– though Flynt later said that the meat grinder image was a criticism of the pornography industry itself.|$|E
25|$|They {{drive the}} War Rig {{overnight}} through swampland and desert, coming across <b>a</b> <b>naked</b> <b>woman</b> the next day. Max suspects a trap, though Furiosa approaches {{the woman and}} states her history and clan affiliation. The naked woman summons her clan, the Vuvalini, who recognize Furiosa {{as one of their}} own who was kidnapped as a child. Furiosa is devastated to learn that the swampland they passed was indeed the Green Place, now uninhabitable. The group then plans to ride motorbikes across immense salt flats in the hope of finding a new home. Max chooses to stay behind, but after seeing visions of a child he failed to save, he convinces them to return to the undefended Citadel, which has ample water and greenery that Joe keeps for himself, and trap Joe and his army in the bikers' canyon.|$|E

25|$|The Kirkwall scroll is a floor cloth which {{contains}} many masonic symbols, many more opaque images, and cryptic writing which may either be a code or badly painted Hebrew. It {{hangs on the}} west wall of the temple of Lodge Kirkwall Kilwinning No. 38(2) in Orkney, but is too long to be completely displayed. It is 18ft 6in long and 5ft 6in wide, and is composed of a full-width central strip stitched at each side to two half-width side strips. The left border appears to show the wanderings of the Israelites before they arrived in Egypt, and reads from top to bottom. The right shows their wanderings in the wilderness after the Exodus, with the route marked in years from 1 to 46, and branching many times at the end. The central cloth contains seven painted scenes and tableaux. The bottom scene shows an altar flanked by two pillars, all surrounded by more or less familiar masonic symbols. Working upwards, the second has an altar surrounded by {{a different set of}} symbols, the third has the altar and pillars together with the cherubim present on the arms of the Antient Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Ireland and the United Grand Lodge of England. Above this is a schematic of the tabernacle of the Ark of the Covenant, followed by what may be the last judgement. The sixth shows a cross atop a pyramid, surmounted by a rainbow, surrounded by masonic and alchemical symbols, and at the top <b>a</b> <b>naked</b> <b>woman,</b> assumed by early authors to be Eve, sitting under a tree surrounded by animals. In the distance is a sea or lake full of fish, and beyond this are mountains. The whole is painted in oil, mainly in pale blue. In the top tableau the woman, fish and animals are pink, the sea green, and the tree and mountains brown.|$|E
500|$|In the end, it took Kindler and Thorpe {{seven days}} {{to write the}} episode, a {{relatively}} quick time for writing a Sanctuary episode. Because of the horror element of the episode, including the [...] "horrible" [...] fate of Jessica Mitchell, [...] "Pavor Nocturnus" [...] was the first episode {{in the first two}} seasons Damian Kindler truly felt was not suitable for children. Also because of this, and the inclusion of an [...] "assault" [...] of <b>a</b> <b>naked</b> <b>woman,</b> considered taboo by the producers, Kindler did not want to include those scenes in any future episodes.|$|E
500|$|The seven-foot tall [...] "Venus" [...] statue {{represents}} <b>a</b> <b>naked</b> <b>woman</b> {{standing in}} front of a huge but dilapidated fountain on a nine foot high granite pedestal. Her arms are wrapped around her belly, and the lower part of the body consists of straight legs placed slightly apart. The breasts are damaged, and the hair is straight. The statue wears two bands as her only ornamentation. The first band is tied around head whereas the other is around the neck, with the ends hanging down in front of the body, reaching down to the thighs, and broad enough to cover the genital area.|$|E
5000|$|The {{painting}} depicts <b>a</b> <b>naked</b> young <b>woman</b> {{standing up}} to mid-calf in water, leaning forward, looking down at a school of tiny fish. She has a rosy complexion, and her curly, dark brown hair is tied back.|$|R

50|$|In 2004, Clark sent {{a letter}} to a friend stating that he had killed a woman on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. He also sent two drawings: one of <b>a</b> handless, <b>naked</b> <b>woman</b> sprawled on her stomach, and another of a map {{pointing}} to where the body was found.|$|R
500|$|The Vénus de Quinipily ( [...] , , [...] ) is {{an ancient}} statue of {{uncertain}} origins, located southeast of Baud, Morbihan, Brittany, in north–western France. It is approximately 2.2 metres (7.2 ft) in height and carved from granite. The statue represents <b>a</b> <b>naked</b> <b>woman</b> and {{stands in front of}} a fountain on a 2.75 m high granite pedestal. The large basin beneath the statue is also carved out of a single granite block. It is believed that the statue may be of Greek, Roman or Egyptian origin. There is similar uncertainty about its subject; it may be a Celtic deity, the Roman Mother goddess Cybele, or an Egyptian Isis statue.|$|E
500|$|After getting {{engaged to}} Jonna Nygrén, Valo tattooed the letter [...] "J" [...] {{on his left}} ring finger. On his chest, Valo has a {{portrait}} of Maya Deren, and on his stomach Klaus Kinski sucking his thumb, while lying on <b>a</b> <b>naked</b> <b>woman.</b> On his back, Valo has the eyes of Edgar Allan Poe, which were done by Kat Von D and her then-husband Oliver Peck. On his lower back, Valo has the Estonian letter for [...] "night", which {{he shares with his}} brother. The letter also has a minus sign inside one of the umlauts, which was done as a tribute to late Type O Negative -singer Peter Steele. On his left leg, Valo also has an Egyptian symbol for [...] "flame".|$|E
500|$|... "Sexual Healing" [...] {{suggests}} celebrities {{involved in}} sexual scandals {{should not be}} forced to undergo rehabilitation and public acts of contrition. The scene in which the celebrities start shaking and dancing, proclaiming [...] "Look, the sex addiction is leaving my body!", demonstrates the insincerity and ridiculousness of these public steps. The episode also mocked the measures used to diagnose and treat sexual addiction in the United States. This is particularly prevalent when Kenny, Kyle and Butters are misdiagnosed with sexual addiction based on an inaccurate test of simply presenting an image of <b>a</b> <b>naked</b> <b>woman</b> to them and testing whether they could identify a handkerchief in the woman's hand and specify its color. The rehabilitation courses themselves are also mocked as ineffective and unnecessary, particularly because the most important lesson taught in them is how to avoid getting caught.|$|E

500|$|Thelema draws its {{principal}} gods and goddesses from Ancient Egyptian religion. The highest deity in the cosmology of Thelema is the goddess Nuit. She {{is the night}} sky arched over the Earth symbolized {{in the form of}} <b>a</b> <b>naked</b> <b>woman.</b> She is conceived as the Great Mother, the ultimate source of all things. [...] The second principal deity of Thelema is the god Hadit, conceived as the infinitely small point, complement and consort of Nuit. [...] Hadit symbolizes manifestation, motion, and time. He is also described in Liber AL vel Legis as [...] "the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star". [...] The third deity in the cosmology of Thelema is Ra-Hoor-Khuit, a manifestation of Horus. He is symbolized as a throned man with the head of a hawk who carries a wand. He is associated with the Sun and the active energies of Thelemic magick. [...] Other deities within the cosmology of Thelema are Hoor-paar-kraat (or Harpocrates), god of silence and inner strength, the brother of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, Babalon, the goddess of all pleasure, known as the Virgin Whore, and Therion, the beast that Babalon rides, who represents the wild animal within man, a force of nature.|$|E
2500|$|The critic Jean Claude {{writes in}} his review of the same salon, with {{reference}} to Nu à la cheminée, published in Le Petit Parisien, [...] "Metzinger painted a puzzle, cubic and triangular, which after verification, is <b>a</b> <b>naked</b> <b>woman.</b> I managed to discover the head, torso and legs. I {{had to give up}} finding arms. This is beyond comprehension".|$|E
2500|$|... "In {{the absence}} of more {{evidence}} than such brief snatches of commentary in wide-ranging salon reviews can provide, we can only speculate" [...] writes Cottington [...] "as to whether Metzinger intended, or its initial audience read, the provocative juxtaposition in this painting of <b>a</b> <b>naked</b> <b>woman</b> with horse, and of natural with cosmetic adornment, as a follow-up to Tea Time's essay on sensation and the viewer's apprehension of it." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Super Friends make an {{appearance}} in the episode when Peter references {{a time when he}} played strip poker in the Hall of Justice. After Wonder Woman loses and takes off her clothes, Robin simply stares at Peter instead of <b>a</b> <b>naked</b> Wonder <b>Woman.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the center}} of the panel there are several {{overlapping}} faces, which symbolize the fusion of the races: the largest in red, represents the American race.

2500|$|Chef is {{also known}} for {{frequently}} engaging in casual sex, a habit he often expresses through song. He drives a 1980s woodie station wagon with a vanity plate that reads [...] "LUV CHEF". He is often seen accompanied by numerous young women when at home or on vacation, and is even revealed {{to have had a}} one-night stand with Kathie Lee Gifford. He once resorted to male prostitution in an effort to raise money to pay legal fees, and had sex with nearly every woman in South Park before having to stop due to exhaustion. In [...] "The Succubus", Chef briefly becomes an office worker and took up monogamy after meeting a woman named Veronica. The two were engaged to be married until it was revealed that Veronica was actually a succubus. In the South Park video game, the children can seek Chef's advice at one of the many buildings labelled [...] "Chef's Shack O' Love", which is implied to be a brothel, complete with <b>a</b> <b>naked</b> <b>woman</b> in Chef's bed.|$|E
2500|$|According to John Ruskin's biographer Mary Lutyens, {{the notable}} author, artist, and art critic was {{apparently}} accustomed {{only to the}} hairless nudes portrayed unrealistically in art, never having seen <b>a</b> <b>naked</b> <b>woman</b> before his wedding night. He was allegedly so shocked by his discovery of his wife Effie's pubic hair that he rejected her, and the marriage was later legally annulled. He {{is supposed to have}} thought his wife was freakish and deformed. Later writers have often followed Lutyens and repeated this version of events. For example, Gene Weingarten in his book I'm with Stupid (2004) writes that [...] "Ruskin had [...] annulled because he was horrified to behold upon his bride a thatch of hair, rough and wild, similar to a man's. He thought her a monster." [...] However, there is no proof for this, and some disagree. Peter Fuller in his book Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace writes, [...] "It has been said that he was frightened on the wedding night by the sight of his wife's pubic hair; more probably, he was perturbed by her menstrual blood." [...] Ruskin's biographers Tim Hilton and John Batchelor also believe that menstruation is the more likely explanation.|$|E
