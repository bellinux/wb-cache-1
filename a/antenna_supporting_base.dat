40|$|An error {{analysis}} is presented for the image reconstruction algorithm currently {{employed by the}} electronically steered thinned array radiometer aircraft instrument. This instrument samples components of the Fourier transform of the brightness temperature distribution at 1. 4 GHz. Sources of error are identified, including systematic offsets and stochastic noise in the measurements, errors in the interference pattern antenna calibration, multipath scattering from the <b>antenna</b> <b>support</b> structure, mutual coupling between nearby array elements, and variations in the antenna patterns of the array elements. These errors are shown to produce artifacts in the image which appear as 'streaks' running along the instrument flight line. Possible hardware corrections are discussed. These include {{a reduction in the}} profile of the <b>antenna</b> <b>support</b> structure and a decoupling of adjacent and other nearby array elements using corrugated 'skirts'. Also discussed are several image enhancement techniques which detect and correct for some of the streaking.
