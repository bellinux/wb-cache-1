40|$|Coal-Bed Methane (CBM) or coal-bed gas {{is a form}} {{of natural}} gas {{extracted}} from coal beds. The term refers to methane adsorbed into the solid matrix of the coal. In order to understand the performance of a CBM reservoir, we need to know the Original Gas in Place, Production Rates and also Recovery Factor. This is mainly on creating a Microsoft Excel ® 2007 with the help of Visual Basic for Application (VBA) based CBM forecast tool. Field data from Mukah-Balingian Coalfield Sarawak is analyzed and forecasted. Original Gas in Place is calculated by multiplying the mass of the coal with the initial gas content of the coal bed. Following from the generated Relative Permeability data, production rates for both water and gas calculated over a specific time range. During the whole production, an abandonment condition which is mainly the pressure will be set by the engineers. Using this <b>abandonment</b> <b>pressure,</b> we can calculate the recovery factor. Using constant values of Langmuir Volume of 714. 29 scf/ton, Langmuir Pressure of 1024. 5 psia and reference initial pressure of 2000 psia; flowing pressure of 100 psia which is also the <b>abandonment</b> <b>pressure,</b> various range of skin, permeability, initial gas content as well as porosity tested to predict the field performance.

In the next step, to study the contribution of this parameter and perform a sensitivity analysis of the process concerning this parameter, scenario 5.2 was rerun in two stages. Keeping other gas storage operational parameters constant, scenario 5.2 was launched with double working gas volume and also with half working gas volume in the first and second stages, respectively.

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{completed}} which examined the technical, operational and safety issues associated with subsea production and subsea well systems. The rapidly accelerating shift to subsea production represents {{a significant departure from}} conventional production operations. The subsea environment is perhaps the most remote and unexplored on earth. This remoteness makes monitoring and intervention much more difficult and raises unique environmental issues. Historically, subsea production and subsea well systems have had a good track record. However, these systems are now being deployed in ways rarely encountered in previous development schemes, presenting a number of technical challenges. One of the key challenges is to address the expected poor primary recoveries from subsea wells. Subsea production systems require the transportation of a multiphase mixture of oil, water and gas for many miles from the producing well to a distant processing facility. Industry and regulators are increasingly becoming aware that, while reducing up-front capital outlays, long, multiphase flowlines add additional backpressure, reducing flow rates and ultimate recoveries. For example, conventional production operations routinely drawdown wellhead pressures to 10 - 20 bar, while subsea completed wells may have <b>abandonment</b> wellhead <b>pressures</b> over 100 bar due to the backpressure added by the long multiphase flowline. One of the challenges posed by subsea production is how to reduce wellhead pressure to allow effective recovery of hydrocarbon resources. To address this issue, there is growing interest in processing the produced fluids subsea, to achieve improved recoveries and greater efficiencies. A goal {{of this study is to}} provide decision makers with the information necessary to assess the conservation impact associated with various subsea production strategies; strategies that may or may not consider subsea processing or subsea multiphase pumping.

Production prior to 1957 {{is not included in}} the cummulative production because of incomplete records. He used the information to plot a p/z curve versus cumulative production to obtain an ultimate steam recovery of 135 billion pounds from the shallow zone to an <b>abandonment</b> <b>pressure</b> of 65 psig. A brief engineering study was presented by Lipman, et al (1977), at which time eleven power generating plants were in operation.

30|$|In this study, the {{standard}} (BO) PVT properties for a {{gas condensate reservoir}} are rigorously simulated by performing a series of flash calculations of the gas condensate fluid at the prescribed conditions through a constant volume depletion (CVD) path. The CVD process mimics the depletion mechanism of gas condensate reservoirs as described earlier. The algorithm consists of pre-calculation steps and nine calculation steps. Its graphical representation and complete calculation procedure are described in Appendix B. The detailed procedure {{can be found in}} Vardcharragosad (2011). The Walsh–Towler’s method (Walsh and Lake 2003) and Whitson–Torp method (Whitson and Torp 1983) are used to analyze the resulting PVT data. This study is based on the reservoir fluid characterization and input data detailed in Appendix A. Pre-calculation starts by assuming there is 1.0 MMSCF of Gas-Equivalent inside the PVT cell of study charged with the reservoir fluid of study at dew point conditions. Dew point pressure, the PVT cell volume, surface gas (G), and stock tank oil (N) at the dew point are determined using flash calculations. The main calculation begins by dropping the pressure inside the PVT cell to the new pressure level then evaluating amount and properties of each phase inside the PVT cell. The new PVT cell volume at the new pressure level is calculated and the amount of excess reservoir gas is removed to bring the PVT cell back to its initial. The amount and properties of G and N then can be extracted from the remaining reservoir gas and oil inside the PVT cell after excess gas removal is evaluated. Then, Bo, Bg, Rs, and Rv values are calculated using the definitions presented in Fig.  1. This calculation process will be repeated at the new pressure level until the pressure inside the PVT cell reaches the <b>abandonment</b> <b>pressure</b> condition.|$|E
40|$|Investigating {{the effects}} of in situ thermal {{treatment}} on coal seams requires adequate knowledge of gas sorption and its kinet¬ics in coal at various temperatures. Methane sorption onto two Australian coal samples (high-volatile bituminous) at dry state and different temperatures was measured. Methane adsorption isotherms were measured at pressures up to 7 MPa by the gas ad¬sorption manometric method. Adsorption isotherms data at two temperatures were used to investigate {{the effects of}} in situ thermal treatment on critical desorption pressure, ultimate gas recovery and the diffusion coefficient in coal. An increase of experimental temperature from 308 to 348 K resulted in a 50 % reduction in the adsorption affinity of the coal sample and an insignificant reduction in the saturation capacity of the isotherms. At higher ex¬perimental temperatures, Langmuir isotherms exhibit downward shift with the initial gas content of the coal seam being constant, resulting in critical gas desorption pressure increase. According to the measured Langmuir isotherms at different temperatures, an increase in reservoir temperature by 1 K leads to a 2 % and 1. 2 % increase in total recovery for the tested coal seams. Gas left in the coal seam at the <b>abandonment</b> <b>pressure</b> can only be recovered at a higher reservoir temperature. Diffusion coefficients of coal seam samples were calculated for different experimental temperatures. Fractional uptakes of the first coal sample show a good agreement with the results obtained using the unipore diffusion model with the diffusion coefficient to be 4. 7 × 10 – 12 m 2 /s at 348 K. For the second coal sample, the unipore diffusion model fairly matches the uptake data. A bidisperse diffusion model was also applied to measure the adsorp¬tion kinetics of the second coal sample, resulting in an improved agreement with the experimental uptake data. Both coal samples exhibited a reduction of the diffusion coefficient {{with an increase in}} equilibrium pressure; this effect was more pronounced at equilibrium pressures below 0. 045 MPa.

40|$|An {{original}} nonlinear three-dimensional {{finite element}} model is developed to predict the residual land subsidence adjacent to depleted gas fields, as a delayed response from an active aquifer which may keep on compacting {{for a long time}} after the field <b>abandonment.</b> The pore <b>pressure</b> recovery within the reservoir and the depletion of the lateral/bottom aquifer are simulated by a subsurface flow model coupled with the equation of state of the residual gas repressurized by the ground water which floods the field. The resulting pore pressure distribution is used as input data in a pore-elastic structural model of land subsidence. The modeling approach is nonlinear because of both the dynamic coupling between the flux from the aquifer and the reservoir gas pressure response, and the dependence of the porous medium elastic properties on the effective intergranular stress and the loading/unloading conditions. The model is applied to the 3, 000 m deep gas reservoir of Dosso degli Angeli, one of the major fields in the Northern Adriatic sedimentary basin, made of three major gas pools. Representative basin-scale mechanical parameters have been obtained from laboratory triaxial and oedometric tests, density logs, and recent measurements of in situ compaction by the use of radioactive markers. In 1992, at the end of 21 year production life the maximum pore pressure drawdown in the depleted pools approached 300 kg/cm(2). The largest land settlement from the modeling simulation turns out to be 31 cm, in good agreement with the available leveling records. Numerical predictions suggest that a residual land sinking of about 10 cm is yet to be expected in 2042, i. e., 50 years after the field abandonment, close to the areas of Porto Garibaldi and Casal Borsetti a few kilometers south and north of the field, respectively, namely between two and three times the subsidence experienced by those areas during the field development.

40|$|The {{extent of}} animal abuse, neglect and <b>abandonment</b> places {{increased}} <b>pressure</b> on animal welfare organisations {{to protect the}} welfare of animals. Such organisations operate under restricting circumstances, doing what they can with what they have and under heavy reliance on support from the public. What is becoming inherently more recognised is that animal abuse has definite psychological implications on individuals within society, be they perpetrators or witnesses. More so, there is a definite correlation between the prevalence of animal abuse and the particular state of a social environment. The ability of a social environment to foster socially toxic (socially toxicity 1) aspects not only influences the prevalence of animal abandonment, abuse and neglect, but more so, through these conditions and these acts of violation upon animals, individuals (perpetrators or witnesses) may become psychologically distanced from healthy moral and ethical behaviour in society. An environment that is specifically attuned to the links between animal abuse and social-toxicity is the South African township. It is an environment predominated by social-toxicity and has little to no animal care facilities or animal welfare education initiatives and hence presents opportunities {{for the expansion of}} elementary ideas into a comprehensive solution. ‘The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated’ (Mahatma Ghandi). If one acknowledges the positive impacts of human-animal interaction on the psychological health of humans, then attempts at addressing the influences of socialtoxicity on the psychology of humans, and in promoting animal care and animal welfare education, must stress the aspect of human-animal interaction within a succinctly tuned architectural environment. Stressing this aspect is achievable through Animal Assisted Activities (AAA) 2, Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT) 3 and critically, through the dissolution of ‘typical’ animal housing into an interactive environment that is beneficial to both the human and animal participant. Of particular importance is the understanding of the synergistic nature of social conditions (i. e. how one condition does not act in isolation from another). This aspect, combined with attempts at rejuvenating the human-animal bond in townships, indicates the significance in the dissolution of theoretical knowledge, gained through the research process, into an architectural scheme; if purposeful sensitivity is to be achieved. Responses of an architectural nature not only articulate a dialogue between operational functions and space but are also based on the requirement of space, in itself, to formulate a dialogue with the user; an experiential dialogue based on spatial richness and variety taking cognisance {{of the fact that the}} built environment has its role to play in inferring positive spatial associations within disadvantaged area...|$|R

40|$|Once a field {{starts to}} produce, new {{information}} becomes available {{in terms of}} production data and measurements. By integrating this information to a reservoir model through a history matching process, an updated uncertainty evaluation of the reservoir can be formed. In the history matching process the current reservoir simulation model will be calibrated to match the new information. This is done {{to be able to}} represent the true dynamic behavior in the reservoir, hence get reliable predictions of the future reservoir behavior. The history matching problem is a non-unique problem, meaning that it has multiple solutions. This thesis presents a case study where history matching is applied to a producing gas field, through an assisted history matching process by the use of MEPO software (Schlumberger). The aim of the study is to get an updated uncertainty evaluation of the reservoir, three years after production start. The thesis will investigate the key uncertainties associated with the dynamic reservoir behavior in the field of study. To be able to capture and mitigate the uncertainties related to reservoir parameters, the ensemble based method Markov chain Monte Carlo is used with Bayesian updating. Utilizing the Bayesian framework imply to take a probabilistic approach to uncertainty. The probabilistic theory and its application to mitigate reservoir uncertainty through a history matching process, are reviewed and further applied in the thesis. In the study, the gas volume in place and the influence from the aquifer, in addition to the internal communication in the reservoir are considered the key uncertainties. The reservoir is divided into regions to be able to capture the uncertainty in different areas. Pore volume- and permeability multipliers for the regions are chosen as uncertain parameters in the study. The pressure in the field are matched by letting the algorithm sample the parameter values from the prior distributions for the uncertain parameters. The sensitivity simulations show the parameter influence on the bottom hole pressures in the wells and on the gas volume. The results show that the pore volume multipliers are the most influential parameters on the match. History matching is carried out in three scenarios. The ensemble of the sufficient history matches makes up the posterior distributions of the uncertain parameters. By analyzing them, it is found; presence of a possible barrier, influence from a small aquifer and a dominating parameter in terms of a pore volume multiplier. Further, the lack of convergence in the Markov chain is tested, the results did not imply lack of convergence in the sufficient scenarios, hence predictions are simulated. The field gas in place for the best matches are found to be in the range between 6. 5 and 8 GSm 3. The predictions show a total production period of 8 - 9 years before <b>abandonment</b> <b>pressure</b> is reached. Even though it is important to obtain a reasonable history match, it is at least just as important with a geologically truthful simulation model to be able to obtain reliable predictions.

40|$|AbstractDepleted gas {{fields are}} seen as {{promising}} options for geological storage of CO 2. The advantage of hydrocarbon fields are that the characteristics, such as the storage capacity and the proven sealing capacity are known. This means that only limited uncertainty remains after a technical feasibility study. One important issue with depleted gas reservoirs is the low pressure, {{at the onset of}} injection. This may lead to adiabatic cooling (Joule- Thomson cooling or JTC). The temperature reduction associated with this JTC can lead to hydrate formation and freezing of the residual pore water, especially the injected fluid also has a low temperature. In a related paper, we report on the development of a simulator, which is capable of predicting the fate of transport of a CO 2 in either the liquid gaseous and supercritical phase. The model only contains CO 2 besides the aqueous phase. One of the remaining challenges is to predict the impact of the methane, which is still present in a depleted gas reservoir, on the phase behavior of CO 2 and the thermal aspects. In this study simulations were performed on the P 18 - 4 depleted gas field. The CO 2 was injected at a minimum temperature of 12 °C into the reservoir formation with a temperature of 120 °C. The average injection rate during the demonstration phase was modelled with 1. 1 Mton/yr over a period of 5 year. The injection of cold CO 2 into P 18 - 4 was modelled in TOUGH 2 and a new module, which can handle not only the behaviour of CO 2 but also of CH 4. The original ECO 2 M module was initially designed for CO 2 behaviour in gas reservoir and aquifers for brine-CO 2 mixtures, including all possible phase transitions, {{in the absence of any}} other gas. The new TOUGH 2 module, which we gave the name ECO 2 MG module, was extended in such a way that compositional flow simulations of two different gases can be modelled, namely CO 2 and CH 4. The ECOMG module can not only model the behaviour brine CO 2 mixtures but also the behaviour of brine-CO 2 -CH 4 mixtures including phase changes from gas to liquid and from super- and sub-critical conditions. Density, viscosity and enthalpy of the CO 2 -CH 4 mixture is based on NIST data. The new TOUGH 2 module was used to model the thermal aspects of CO 2 injection including the presence of brine and CH 4 initially in the reservoir. The reservoir model was initialized with a brine-methane mixture at 20 bar, which is the expected <b>abandonment</b> <b>pressure</b> of the reservoir. The prediction of thermal effects of this new tool were compared with those of the earlier version (CO 2 only) for several times during the projected 5 year injection period. The thermal effects investigated in this study were the JTC and also the effect of evaporation of the aqueous phase. The heat of evaporation of the brine is very significant and cools down the near well area significantly depending on the initial water saturation and the injection temperature of the CO 2 itself. In the new module we saw that after the CO 2 injection was started at first instance an uniform front of CO 2 /CH 4 was formed. After a few years gravity underride of the still gaseous CO 2 becomes visible, which became stronger after the phase transition to liquid CO 2.

Total residual gas volume in 2007 is 80 ± 30 Bcm gas depending on the residual gas saturation, Sgr. Depending on scenario 15 ± 6 Bcm of the residual gas is recovered in 2040, and the recovery factor of residual gas is 15 ± 5 %. In general, with increasing residual gas saturation, residual gas volume increases and the recovery factor of the residual gas zones decreases. The main challenge and purpose of this project has been to understand the physics of residual gas during depletion, and to assess the potential recovery from the residual gas in different parts of the reservoir. A literature study aiming to identify the main driving parameters with respect to residual gas mobility has been conducted and used as a basis for subsequent simulation work. The need to understand the charge history of the field became important in 2008 when an appraisal well in the northern part of the field encountered only residual gas saturations in the crest of the structure and in the middle of the Direct Hydrocarbon Indicator (DHI). Core analyses, well logs and geological interpretation obtained during drilling and gas production in Ormen Lange so far allows the assessment of residual gas, and gives indications of where it resides in the reservoir. Residual gas saturations (Sgr) in the range of 0. 21 to 0. 41 have been observed in water-flood core measurements. Recovery of residual gas depends on the final reservoir pressure. The recovery from the residual gas zone in the south, where the reservoir is well depleted, is good compared to the north where the pressure depletion is limited. Applying the base case residual gas saturation value of 0. 3 and assuming no mobility threshold above residual gas saturation (critical gas saturation is equal to residual gas saturation), the total recovery in 2040 of residual gas is 19 %, see Figure 1. Future development plans will increase total residual gas recovery, as the pressure will be further depleted. In the South where an acting aquifer is present, recovery from residual gas highly depends on the strength of the aquifer. Earlier breakthrough of water with a potential stronger aquifer results in earlier shut-in of the wells, hence higher <b>abandonment</b> <b>pressure</b> and lower recovery of residual gas in the south. The critical gas saturation is one of the parameters that has been extensively investigated in this project. The critical gas saturation is the saturation at which a continuous gas flow can be first observed, coinciding with a non-zero gas relative-permeability. Most literature indicates that residual gas requires approximately 5 % increase of gas saturation units in order to reach critical gas saturation. The implementation of the latter mobility threshold for residual gas in Ormen Lange reduces the total residual gas recovery by 2 %. The flow rate of the remobilized gas depends on how fast the gas relative permeability increases during secondary drainage. Hence changing the slope of the gas relative permeability curve, Ng, and the endpoint value, krg, also affects the ultimate recovery of residual gas...|$|E
