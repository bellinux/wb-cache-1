5|$|Although Michael Kopper worked <b>at</b> <b>Enron</b> {{for more}} than seven years, Lay did not know of Kopper even after the company's bankruptcy. Kopper was able to keep his name {{anonymous}} in the entire affair. Kopper was the first Enron executive to plead guilty. Chief Accounting Officer Rick Causey was indicted with six felony charges for disguising Enron's financial condition during his tenure. After pleading not guilty, he later switched to guilty and was sentenced to seven years in prison.|$|E
5|$|Many {{executives}} <b>at</b> <b>Enron</b> {{were indicted}} {{for a variety}} of charges and some were later sentenced to prison. Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, was found guilty in a United States District Court of illegally destroying documents relevant to the SEC investigation which voided its license to audit public companies, effectively closing the business. By the time the ruling was overturned at the U.S. Supreme Court, the company had lost the majority of its customers and had ceased operating. Enron employees and shareholders received limited returns in lawsuits, despite losing billions in pensions and stock prices. As a consequence of the scandal, new regulations and legislation were enacted to expand the accuracy of financial reporting for public companies. One piece of legislation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, increased penalties for destroying, altering, or fabricating records in federal investigations or for attempting to defraud shareholders. The act also increased the accountability of auditing firms to remain unbiased and independent of their clients.|$|E

500|$|Analysts and {{observers}} continued their complaints regarding the difficulty or impossibility of properly assessing a company whose financial statements were so cryptic.
