40|$|The {{objectives}} are {{to compare the}} airborne asbestos concentrations resulted from mitering of <b>abestos</b> cement roof sheets by a high-speed motor and a hand saw, and to monitor whether other workers near the test sites are vulnerable to the fibers exceeding the occupational exposure limit. Four test cases were carried out and altogether 7 personal and 4 area air samples were collected. The NIOSH method 7400 was employed for the air samplings and analysis. Using the phase contrast microscopy, fiber counting was conducted under Rule A. The study showed that the fiber concentration medians for personal air samples gathered from the two tools were 4. 11 fibers/cc (ranged: 1. 33 - 12. 41 fibers/cc) and 0. 13 fibers/cc (ranged: 0. 01 - 5. 00 fibers/cc) respectively. The median for the area samples was 0. 59 fibers/cc (ranged: 0. 14 - 3. 32 fibers/cc). Comparing each study case, the concentration level caused by the high-speed motor saw was {{more than twice that}} of the hand saw.

40|$|Although {{the use of}} {{amphibole}} sbestos (crocidolite and amouite) {{has been}} banned in most European countries because of its known effects on the lung and pleura, chrysotile asbestos remains in use {{in a number of}} widely used products, notably asbestos cement and. fricton in vehicle brakes and dutches. A. an on chrysotile throout the Eurpean Union for these remaining applications is currentl under consideration, but this requires confidence in the safety of substitute materials.

Não houve efeito dos teores de milheto sobre o peso final, ganho de peso, conversão alimentar aparente, taxa de eficiência protéica e sobrevivência dos alevinos. Foi observado efeito quadrático para o custo/kg ganho, em que o menor custo foi obtido com 20, 31 % de inclusão de milheto. Conclui-se que o milheto pode ser incluído em até 30, 00 % em substituição ao milho nas rações para alevinos de piavuçu, sem afetar o desempenho.

40|$|Accidents causing {{environmental}} damages and/or harm {{to several}} (third party) victims {{may result from}} the joint action of competing firms, {{in such a way}} that it may be too costly or impossible for Courts to disentangle the specific contribution of each firm (cf noise pollution by Orly airport 1988, Cass. 2 e civ, No 86 - 12. 543; <b>abestos</b> litigation in USA 1994, Becker v. Baron Bros). Courts in many jurisdictions have the opportunity in such contexts to conclude for firms liability in solidum, and to allocate the burden of damages between offenders thanks to alternative apportionment rules. In this paper, we analyze the impacts of such liability sharing arrangements (per capita vs market share rule) on output and care decisions in an oligopoly. For a symmetric oligopoly, we find that compared to the per capita rule, the market share rule leads to a lower output level but also to lower care expenditures at equilibrium. However as the net effect on the expected harm to victims is ambiguous, it is not clear that the market share rule is dominating the per capita rule. Moreover, we also show that no sharing arrangement induce the optimal levels of output and care expenditures. For an asymmetric oligopoly, we find that equilibrium market shares between low cost firms and high cost firms are more dispersed under the per capita rule than under the market share rule. This suggests the existence of strong ties between competition law and liability law, some liability regimes for joint offenders cases developing more anticompetitive effects than others. To the least, our analysis shows that the per capita rule (market share rule) provides (preserves) competitive advantages to the most (least) efficient firms. We also find that high costs firms produce more and invest more in care under the per capita rule than under the market share rule; in contrast, the comparison is undertermined for low costs firms, and thus for the industry...|$|E
