5|$|Cramer v. United States (1923) {{involved}} would-be Indian reservations (as {{provided for}} in the aforementioned unratified treaties) that had subsequently been granted to railroads by the federal government. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California canceled the railroad's land patents based upon the actual use and occupation of the Indians since 1855.

30|$|P/E ratio <b>at</b> <b>issuing.</b> Price-{{earnings}} ratio <b>at</b> <b>issuing</b> is {{the ratio}} of the issue price per share of an IPO firm to its earnings per share last accounting period when it is issuing, which can measure the value to invest in the issue bidding. The variable is obtained from Wind Database.|$|R
30|$|In model 1, only control {{variables}} are inputted, {{and the result}} of analysis shows that firm age and IPO size, especially P/E ratio <b>at</b> <b>issuing,</b> are significantly correlated to IPO valuation. However, the significant correlation between IPO valuation and P/E ratio <b>at</b> <b>issuing</b> {{can be explained by the}} fact that the calculations of both variables involve the issue price.|$|R

5|$|After the war, {{he moved}} back to Abingdon. During Reconstruction, Robertson {{was a member of}} the Committee of Nine, led by Alexander H. H. Stuart, that sought Virginia's {{readmission}} to the Union. <b>At</b> <b>issue</b> was the new state constitution, which included disenfranchisement of many white males. The committee successfully negotiated with the Federal government to have that clause voted on separately, so that Virginians would accept and ratify the new constitution and so rejoin the Union. He died on February 11, 1888, and was buried at Cobbs, Chesterfield County.|$|E
5|$|Against Walpole's wishes, but to George's delight, Britain reopened {{hostilities}} with Spain in 1739. Britain's {{conflict with}} Spain, the War of Jenkins' Ear, {{became part of}} the War of the Austrian Succession when a major European dispute broke out upon the death of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740. <b>At</b> <b>issue</b> was the right of Charles's daughter, Maria Theresa, to succeed to his Austrian dominions. George spent the summers of 1740 and 1741 in Hanover, where he was more able to intervene directly in European diplomatic affairs in his capacity as elector.|$|E
5|$|Among Beshear's other {{activities}} as lieutenant governor was {{his participation in}} an investigation of Kentucky Utilities' coal-buying practices. <b>At</b> <b>issue</b> was whether it was legal and ethical for the company's coal buyer to accept gifts and other perks from coal suppliers. Beshear had clashed with the company over similar issues during his term as attorney general. The company attempted to block Beshear's participation in the investigation, but the Kentucky Public Service Commission rejected the attempt. Due {{to the length of}} the investigation and the number of appeals filed, the matter was not fully adjudicated until 1992, well past the end of Beshear's term. The Kentucky Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of Kentucky Utilities.|$|E

5|$|From 1950 to 1952, {{there were}} a series of {{disputes}} between EES director Rosselot and Georgia Tech vice president Cherry Emerson over the station's finances and Rosselot's hand in founding Scientific Associates. When {{it was founded in}} October 1951, Rosselot was president and CEO of Scientific Associates; <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> was the potential conflict of interest with his role at Georgia Tech, and what, if any, role Georgia Tech should have in technology transfer to the marketplace. Emerson later instituted a policy requiring EES employees wishing to work with Scientific Associates to make a written request to the president of Georgia Tech. However, Rosselot's participation in Scientific Associates' founding and early operations ensured the eventual success of Scientific Atlanta and facilitated subsequent technology transfer by Georgia Tech's VentureLab and the Advanced Technology Development Center.|$|E
5|$|Ginsburg {{was in the}} {{minority}} for Gonzales v. Carhart, , a 5–4 decision upholding restrictions on partial birth abortion. In her dissent, Ginsburg opposed the majority's decision to defer to legislative findings that the procedure was not safe for women. Ginsburg focused her ire on the way Congress reached its findings and with the veracity of the findings. Joining the majority for Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , a case which struck down parts of a 2013 Texas law regulating abortion providers, Ginsburg also authored a short concurring opinion which was even more critical of the legislation <b>at</b> <b>issue.</b> She asserted the legislation was not aimed at protecting women's health, as Texas had claimed, but rather to impede women's access to abortions.|$|E

5|$|In August 2009, TIE began legal {{proceedings}} against the BSC consortium over delays to the project, and track-laying on Leith Walk, Shandwick Place and Haymarket was suspended. <b>At</b> <b>issue</b> were alleged changes to BSC's work specification, including track works on Princes Street and £5 million additional costs for foundation work near Murrayfield Stadium. The BSC consortium alleged that TIE had not diverted the underground utilities {{in time for}} track-laying to begin, breaching contractual agreements and costing the consortium additional staffing expenditure.|$|E
5|$|In Waters v. Churchill (1994), the Court {{was faced}} with two differing {{accounts}} of the speech <b>at</b> <b>issue.</b> The question presented to the Court was whether the Connick test ought be applied to what the employer thought was said or what was actually said. The case revolved around a nurse dismissed for a conversation she had with a coworker. There was a discrepancy between what she argued was said and what her employer thought was said. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joined by a plurality of justices, opined that the Connick test must {{be applied to the}} speech the employer thought occurred, and on which it acted, rather than that which the finder of fact determines did occur.|$|E

5|$|Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez, , is a {{decision}} of the Supreme Court of the United States concerning the constitutionality of funding restrictions imposed by the United States Congress. <b>At</b> <b>issue</b> were restrictions on the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), a private, non-profit corporation established by Congress. The restrictions prohibited LSC attorneys from representing clients attempting to amend (or challenge) existing welfare law. The case was brought by Carmen Velazquez, whose LSC-funded attorneys sought to challenge existing welfare provisions, believing {{it was the only}} way to get Velazquez financial relief.|$|E
5|$|One point still <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> is the {{position}} of Ch'olan and Q'anjobalan–Chujean. Some scholars think these form a separate Western branch (as in the diagram below). Other linguists {{do not support the}} positing of an especially close relationship between Ch'olan and Q'anjobalan–Chujean; consequently they classify these as two distinct branches emanating directly from the proto-language. An alternative proposed classification groups the Huastecan branch as springing from the Ch'olan-Tzeltalan node, rather than as an outlying branch springing directly from the proto-Mayan node.|$|E

5|$|SJS has {{roots in}} {{criminal}} trials during the Vietnam War era, but {{in modern times}} is usually employed in high-stakes civil litigation (where only money is usually <b>at</b> <b>issue,</b> in contrast to criminal trials, where the defendant can go to prison). SJS practitioners determine what background characteristics and attitudes predict favorable results, and then coordinate with attorneys in choosing the jury. Studies are mixed as {{to the effectiveness of}} the practice, though {{it is clear that the}} evidence presented at trial is the most important determiner of verdicts (the trial result) and that SJS is more likely to have an impact where that evidence is ambiguous. SJS's potential to unfairly skew the jury has led to some reform proposals, but none have yet been implemented. The limited fictional portrayals of SJS have been negative towards the practice.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after George's {{accession}} in Hanover, the War of the Spanish Succession broke out. <b>At</b> <b>issue</b> was {{the right}} of Philip, the grandson of King Louis XIV of France, to succeed to the Spanish throne {{under the terms of}} King Charles II of Spain's will. The Holy Roman Empire, the United Dutch Provinces, England, Hanover and many other German states opposed Philip's right to succeed because they feared that the French House of Bourbon would become too powerful if it also controlled Spain. As part of the war effort, George invaded his neighbouring state, Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, which was pro-French, writing out some of the battle orders himself. The invasion succeeded with few lives lost. As a reward, the prior Hanoverian annexation of the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg by George's uncle was recognised by the British and Dutch.|$|E
