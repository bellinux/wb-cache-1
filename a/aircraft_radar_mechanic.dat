5000|$|HMS Valkyrie was a stone frigate {{training}} establishment situated on Douglas Head on the Isle of Man.

50|$|Due {{to their}} {{dependence}} on target <b>aircraft</b> <b>radar</b> emissions, when used against fighter aircraft passive anti-radiation missiles are primarily limited to forward-aspect intercept geometry. For examples, see Vympel R-27, Brazo, and AIM-97 Seekbat.|$|R

50|$|For example, an L-Band radar with 500 Hz {{pulse rate}} {{produces}} ambiguous velocity above 75 m/s (170 mile/hour), while detecting true range up to 300 km. This combination {{is appropriate for}} civilian <b>aircraft</b> <b>radar</b> and weather radar.|$|R

50|$|In 1969 {{computer}} programming modifications permitted 4,096 possible transponder codes for friendly <b>aircraft</b> <b>radar</b> identification. This permitted assignment {{of a unique}} code to each military aircraft in the Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force region, providing positive identification capability.|$|R
40|$|Radiometric {{measurements}} at 90 GHz {{and three}} sideband frequencies near the peak water-vapor absorption line of 183. 3 GHz {{were made with}} the Advanced Microwave Moisture Sounder (AMMS) aboard the NASA DC- 8 aircraft over Alaska on November 28, 1989. These measurements show that when the atmosphere is relatively dry the total precipitable water and snow cover could be estimated with high sensitivity. The estimated total precipitable water correlates positively with the <b>aircraft</b> <b>radar</b> altitude. This positive correlation is expected because <b>aircraft</b> <b>radar</b> altitude provides a measure of atmospheric burden above the surface. The surface reflectivities at both 90 and 183 GHz are also estimated {{which can be used}} to estimate snow water equivalent...|$|R
50|$|In early 1949, the Radio Operations School {{transferred}} to Keesler from Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. In addition to training radio operators, Keesler {{was to begin}} teaching air traffic service technicians; aircraft approach controllers, ground <b>radar</b> <b>mechanics,</b> and <b>radar</b> repairman/ground controlled approach specialists. The last mechanics training courses had moved to Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas, by November.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{intentions}} were for a squadron strength air insertion from Hermes using personnel from D Squadron, 22 Regiment.

5|$|Following Allied {{victory in}} the Battle of the Atlantic – through {{long-range}} <b>aircraft,</b> <b>radar,</b> code decryption, and better escort tactics – the need to camouflage ships from submarines greatly decreased, and diffused lighting research became a low priority. The work was halted when the war ended.|$|R
50|$|The mission {{section of}} the {{simulator}} encompasses the actual mechanics of flying the <b>aircraft,</b> <b>radar</b> and weapons operation, threat evaluation, radio communications and navigation.

50|$|The C-38A {{was also}} ordered for the United States Navy, {{replacing}} North American T-2 Buckeye aircraft at Naval Air Station Patuxent River beginning in September 2015. The C-38 is tasked with {{acting as a}} chase <b>aircraft,</b> <b>radar</b> test target, and pilot proficiency aircraft for the test and evaluation squadron VX-20.|$|R
50|$|Planned by the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), the T-48 Training System (T-48TS) {{was planned}} {{to consist of}} the <b>aircraft,</b> <b>radar,</b> a ground based {{training}} system and curriculum, and life cycle support, initially for two years' time. Solicited for proposals in 2003, in 2004 the programme was deferred for further study.|$|R
50|$|When {{a missile}} launch is detected, {{indicated}} by the difference in radar signal and type, the ALE-55 runs a last resort attempt to protect the aircraft towing it. This last resort is becoming the target, rather than the aircraft, by trying to jam the missile or simulating the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>radar</b> signature.|$|R
25|$|The missile is {{fitted with}} a dual-color seeker, {{featuring}} 70-degree look angle with 40 degrees per second track rate, and a 50% longer range, as well as maneuverability improvements achieved by changing the original missile's flight controls aerodynamics. The MAA-1B is capable of being appointed by the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>radar</b> or the HMD helmet.|$|R
5000|$|To take {{advantage}} of the increased field-of-view that now exceeded the capabilities of most <b>aircraft</b> <b>radars</b> also meant that helmet mounted sights gained popularity.Many newer missiles include what is known as [...] "look-down-shoot-down" [...] capability, as they could be fired onto low flying planes that would formerly be lost in ground clutter.|$|R
50|$|Making his YouTube {{debut in}} August 2006 with Telling it all, {{a series of}} five-to-ten minute autobiographical videos, Oakley gained {{immediate}} popularity with a wide section of the YouTube community.

50|$|On 30 June 1944, Shelikof {{departed}} San Pedro for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. On 9 July 1944, she {{was underway}} from Pearl Harbor with a convoy bound for Eniwetok. While at Eniwetok from 18 July to 1 August, Shelikof had her aviation machine shop and carpenter shop converted into combination <b>aircraft</b> and <b>aircraft</b> <b>radar</b> maintenance facilities.|$|R
50|$|The pilot {{attempted}} {{to regain control}} {{but was unable to}} and he and the co-pilot both ejected. The low level made it impossible for Squadron Leader Stroud (Howard's regular co-pilot who was in the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>radar</b> navigator's seat), Squadron Leader Eames, Squadron Leader Gamble, and Frederick Bassett to exit the aircraft and they were killed.|$|R
50|$|Electronic radar {{equipment}} for the station was installed and calibrated by specialist RAAF personnel. 220 Radar Station was a unit of RAAF 42 Radar Wing with headquarters in Townsville. Headquarters {{was responsible for the}} establishment of 2 RIMU (Radar Installation and Maintenance Unit) which provided specialist installation, calibration and maintenance support for RAAF radar stations in north Queensland. <b>Radar</b> <b>mechanics</b> regularly were required to climb the towers to service relay switches and aerials.|$|R
50|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of the CH network necessitated more technical and operational personnel than the UK could provide, and in 1940, a formal request {{was made by the}} British High Commission, Ottawa of the Canadian Government, appealing for men skilled in radio technology for the service of the defence of Great Britain. By the end of 1941, 1,292 trained personnel had enlisted and most were rushed to England to serve as <b>radar</b> <b>mechanics.</b>|$|R
50|$|The US Weather Bureau (precursor to the National Weather Service) {{obtained}} 25 AN/APS-2F <b>aircraft</b> <b>radars</b> {{from the}} Navy in 1946.

The modifications were performed by the Weather Bureau, which called the modified APS-2F radars WSR-1s, -1As, -3s, and -4s.|$|R
50|$|One of {{its former}} chief {{designers}} was Adolf Tolkachev, who became an American spy {{and over the years}} between 1979 and 1985, supplied {{a great deal of information}} about such projects R-23, R-24, R-33, R-27, and R-60, S-300, as well as about fighter-interceptor <b>aircraft</b> <b>radars</b> used on MiG-29, MiG-31, and Su-27 and other avionics directly to the CIA.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA recently developed SSM/I exponential rain algorithm is evaluated using passive microwave data from ERICA OPs 2, 3, 4, and 5. Resulting SSM/I rain analyses were first compared with <b>aircraft</b> <b>radar</b> and coastal radar data. SSM/I rain analyses in IOPs 2, 3 and 4 were then used with GOES enhanced IR imagery to determine ERICA cyclones' synoptic rain structure. The SSM/I rain analysis in IOP 5 agreed {{well with the}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>radar</b> and coastal radar observations. Maximum SSM/I rain rate areas coincided with the radar intensity observation, but SSM/I rain rates were somewhat less than inferred by the radar. SSM/I rain rate analyses clearly delineate the liquid precipitation patterns within the IOP 2, 3, and 4 cyclones. The SSM/I rain rate data shows promise to significantly improve analysis of precipitation over the ocean, where conventional data is notably sparse. [URL] United States Air Forc...|$|R
