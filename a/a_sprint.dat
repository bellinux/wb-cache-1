5|$|This {{stage was}} flat, {{with only a}} climb to short {{elevation}} near the end. A preview predicted <b>a</b> <b>sprint</b> finish, but a late attack decided the stage.|$|E
5|$|As in {{previous}} years, the spectators tried to assist their preferred riders {{by trying to}} impede their opponents. On the first stage, nails had been thrown on the road, and all cyclists except Lucien Petit-Breton punctured. This stage was won by Emile Georget in <b>a</b> <b>sprint.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the Giro di Lombardia, Astana's final {{race of the}} season, {{they were}} more {{successful}} {{than they had been}} most of the season, attaining a fourth podium finish in a one-day race on the year. While Damiano Cunego had broken away from the field with 15 kilometers left to race to win the event, Brajkovič won <b>a</b> <b>sprint</b> over 's Rigoberto Urán for second, and reacted as though he won the race. Chris Horner was also highly placed in the event, finishing seventh.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Kentucky {{had wanted}} {{the jury to}} force NASCAR to grant the {{speedway}} <b>a</b> <b>Sprint</b> Cup Series event but in 2007 they changed their demand to instead force the France family to sell either NASCAR or ISC. The track is also demanding that NASCAR develop objective standards for the awarding of their race events and damages of $200 million. In January 2008, the court dismissed the lawsuit, saying that the plaintiffs had failed to make their case. Kentucky Speedway says they will appeal the court's decision.|$|E
5|$|Stage eleven was {{marred by}} rainy weather, which caused many splits in the peloton. Fabio Fontanelli won the stage {{as a member of}} the lead group, but tenth-place {{finisher}} Bruno Leali gained a six-second race lead by finishing more than three minutes in front of overall leader Miguel Indurain. The Giro's twelfth stage began with a large climb which led to many attacks. Despite the flurry of attacks, the whole peloton eventually made it to the finish line together for <b>a</b> <b>sprint</b> finish that was won by Russian Dimitri Konyshev.|$|E

5|$|The 2009 Giro d'Italia {{began on}} 9 May, with Stage 11 {{occurring}} on 20 May. The first stage, {{like it had}} been since 2007, was a team time trial, a stage where each member of the team raced together against the clock. Like most cycling Grand Tours do, the beginning of the 2009 Giro included a string of flat stages that were contested by sprinters. These stages were contested by Alessandro Petacchi and Mark Cavendish, among others, with Petacchi in victory becoming one of the only riders to defeat Cavendish in <b>a</b> <b>sprint</b> in the 2009 season.|$|E

There are approximately 383 AM and 659 FM radio stations and 297 television and 873 cable television stations. On March 29, 1994, the country went live on the Internet via a 64 kbit/s connection from a router serviced by PLDT to <b>a</b> <b>Sprint</b> router in California. Estimates for Internet penetration in the Philippines vary widely ranging {{from a low of}} 2.5million to a high of 24million people. Social networking and watching videos are among the most frequent Internet activities.|$|E
5|$|The {{final stage}} of the race was a flat stage that {{finished}} in Madrid. It was won in <b>a</b> <b>sprint</b> by Degenkolb. During the stage, Valverde took advantage of a puncture for Rodríguez and won the intermediate sprint {{to give him the}} points jersey. Although Aru lost a little time in a split in the peloton at the finish line, the rest of the standings were unchanged. Aru therefore won the race, his first Grand Tour victory.|$|E

Davide Rebellin of Italy and Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland, finishing second and third place with {{the same time as}} Sánchez, received silver and bronze medals respectively for the event. The hot and humid conditions were {{in sharp contrast to the}} heavy rain weathered in the women's road race the following day.|$|E
5|$|The team mostly lay {{low in the}} race's {{first week}} and a half, with only fourth in <b>a</b> <b>sprint</b> from Assan Bazayev in Stage 4 and fifth in Stage 6 by Maxim Iglinsky from a {{breakaway}} to show for themselves through nine stages. Contador and Klöden both showed strongly in the Stage 10 individual time trial, with Contador missing the stage win by just 8 seconds (Klöden was third, 20 seconds off Marzio Bruseghin's winning time) and moving from eighth to fourth in the overall classification.|$|E

5|$|When the two entered Roubaix, Wegmuller {{ran over}} {{a plastic bag}} that flew {{out in front of}} him, which became jammed in his derailleur. Wegmuller was unable to change gears which was crucial for <b>a</b> <b>sprint</b> finish. He got {{assistance}} from his team car to remove the bag, but his gears still would not change. Knowing that a bicycle change would be suicidal to his chances, Wegmuller continued on his damaged bike; Demol continued to draft behind him.|$|E
5|$|Zersenay Tadese (Tigrinya: ዘርእሰናይ ታደሰ; born 8 February 1982) is an Eritrean long-distance track, {{and road}} running athlete. He {{currently}} holds the men's half marathon world record. His bronze {{medal in the}} 10,000 metres at the 2004 Athens Olympics made him the first ever Eritrean Olympic medallist, and his 20km title at the 2006 IAAF World Road Running Championships also made him the country's first athlete to win at a world championship event. He does not use <b>a</b> <b>sprint</b> finish to win races: his strategy relies upon a combination of efficient running and fast pace setting.|$|E
5|$|Because the Sprint was {{designed}} to operate at short range, a single base could not provide protection to a typical US city, given urban sprawl. This required the Sprint launchers to be distributed around the defended area. Because <b>a</b> <b>Sprint</b> launched from a remote base might not be visible to the MAR during {{the initial stages of}} the launch, Bell proposed building a much simpler radar at most launch sites, the Missile Site Radar (MSR). MSR would have just enough power and logic to generate tracks for its outgoing Sprint missiles and would hand that information off to the DCDPS using conventional telephone lines and modems. Bell noted that the MSR could also provide a useful second-angle look at threat tubes, which might allow the decoys to be picked out earlier. Used as radio receivers, they could also triangulate any radio broadcasts coming from the threat tube, which the enemy might use as a radar jammer.|$|E
50|$|In one of {{the most}} {{surprising}} comebacks in cycling history, Maertens won the 1981 World Championship, which was held in Prague. In <b>a</b> <b>sprinting</b> duel he had one ultimate jump left which sufficed to defeat runner-up Saronni.|$|R
