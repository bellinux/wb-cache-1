5|$|Different {{branches}} of Taoism often have differing pantheons of lesser deities, where these deities reflect different notions of cosmology. Lesser deities <b>also</b> <b>may</b> be promoted or demoted for their activity. Some varieties of popular Chinese religion incorporate the Jade Emperor, {{derived from the}} main of the Three Purities, as {{a representation of the}} most high God.|$|E
5|$|No fossil {{evidence}} of Dimetrodons skin {{has yet been}} found. Impressions of {{the skin of a}} related animal, Estemmenosuchus, indicate {{that it would have been}} smooth and well-provided with glands. Dimetrodon <b>also</b> <b>may</b> have had large scutes on the underside of its tail and belly, as other synapsids did.|$|E
5|$|Prosody is {{the study}} of the meter, rhythm, and {{intonation}} of a poem. Rhythm and meter are different, although closely related. Meter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as iambic pentameter), while rhythm is the actual sound that results from a line of poetry. Prosody <b>also</b> <b>may</b> be used more specifically to refer to the scanning of poetic lines to show meter.|$|E

5|$|Species that {{do need to}} swim {{continuously}} {{to breathe}} go through {{a process known as}} sleep swimming, in which the shark is essentially unconscious. It is known from experiments conducted on the spiny dogfish that its spinal cord, rather than its brain, coordinates swimming, so spiny dogfish can continue to swim while sleeping, and this <b>also</b> <b>may</b> be the case in larger shark species.|$|E
5|$|The large frill <b>also</b> <b>may</b> {{have helped}} to {{increase}} body area to regulate body temperature. A similar theory has been proposed regarding the plates of Stegosaurus, although this use alone would {{not account for the}} bizarre and extravagant variation seen in different members of the Ceratopsidae. This observation is highly suggestive of what is now believed to be the primary function, display.|$|E
5|$|Today, shetland sheep {{are mainly}} {{kept in the}} Shetland isles {{and a handful of}} other locales. This is because of their ability to survive on {{infertile}} land that would otherwise be agriculturally useless. Their good-natured temperament is also a major attraction in keeping Shetland sheep. They are most commonly farmed for their prized wool, but they <b>also</b> <b>may</b> be kept for their meat.|$|E

He spent his later years working in display advertising, and answering letters and other requests made by assassination researchers. Altgens and his wife Clara died in 1995 {{at about the same}} time in their Dallas home. Both had suffered from long illnesses, and police said poisoning by a malfunctioning furnace <b>also</b> <b>may</b> have contributed to their deaths.|$|E
5|$|Applesauce cake is {{a dessert}} cake {{prepared}} using apple sauce, flour and sugar as main ingredients. Store-bought or homemade applesauce {{may be used}} in its preparation. Additional ingredients include eggs, butter, margarine or oil, raisins and plumped raisins, dates, chopped apple, chopped nuts (such as walnuts and pecans), cocoa powder, and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and allspice. Some versions include dried or fresh, finely grated ginger. After baking, applesauce cake is sometimes topped with an icing, frosting or glaze, such as a caramel glaze. It <b>also</b> <b>may</b> be served topped with a dusting of confectioner's sugar or whipped cream. Gluten-free applesauce cake can be prepared using rice flour.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim, Marx, and the German theorist Max Weber (1864–1920) are {{typically}} {{cited as the}} three principal architects of sociology. Herbert Spencer, William Graham Sumner, Lester F. Ward, W. E. B. Du Bois, Vilfredo Pareto, Alexis de Tocqueville, Werner Sombart, Thorstein Veblen, Ferdinand Tönnies, Georg Simmel and Karl Mannheim are often included on academic curricula as founding theorists. Curricula <b>also</b> <b>may</b> include Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Marianne Weber and Friedrich Engels as founders of the feminist tradition in sociology. Each key figure {{is associated with a}} particular theoretical perspective and orientation.|$|E

5|$|In addition, if civil {{proceedings}} are taken against the Government, section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from granting injunctions against it. In place of an injunction, the Court {{may make a}} declaration concerning the parties' rights. The Court <b>also</b> <b>may</b> not make an injunction against a government officer if the effect of doing so would be to provide relief {{that could not be}} obtained against the Government directly. Section 2(2) of the Act makes it clear that the term {{civil proceedings}} includes proceedings for judicial review.|$|E
5|$|Like other otters, the North American {{river otter}} {{lives in a}} holt, or den, {{constructed}} in the burrows of other animals, or in natural hollows, such as under a log or in river banks. An entrance, which may be under water or above ground, leads to a nest chamber lined with leaves, grass, moss, bark, and hair. Den sites include burrows dug by woodchucks (Marmota monax), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), nutria (Myocastor coypus), or beaver and muskrat lodges. River otters <b>also</b> <b>may</b> use hollow trees or logs, undercut banks, rock formations, backwater sloughs, and flood debris. The use of den and resting sites is chiefly opportunistic, although locations that provide protection and seclusion are preferred.|$|E
5|$|Organic {{apples are}} {{commonly}} {{produced in the}} United States. Due to infestations by key insects and diseases, organic production is difficult in Europe. The use of pesticides containing chemicals, such as sulfur, copper, microorganisms, viruses, clay powders, or plant extracts (pyrethrum, neem) has {{been approved by the}} EU Organic Standing Committee to improve organic yield and quality. A light coating of kaolin, which forms a physical barrier to some pests, <b>also</b> <b>may</b> help prevent apple sun scalding.|$|E

Moclobemide <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have benefit for some patients with Parkinson's Disease by extending and enhancing the effects of l-dopa.|$|R
25|$|On a {{more general}} level, it remains {{debatable}} whether recognition of one's mirror image implies self-awareness. Likewise, the converse <b>may</b> <b>also</b> false—one <b>may</b> hold self-awareness, but not present a positive result in a mirror test.|$|R
5|$|Pro-{{feminism}} is {{the support}} of feminism without implying that the supporter {{is a member of}} the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men <b>also</b> <b>may</b> be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, men's studies, and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the {{political}} relationship between Æthelberht and the Franks, there is abundant evidence of strong connections across the English Channel. There was a luxury trade between Kent and the Franks, and burial artefacts found include clothing, drink, and weapons that reflect Frankish cultural influence. The Kentish burials have a greater range of imported goods {{than those of the}} neighbouring Anglo-Saxon regions, which is not surprising given Kent's easier access to trade across the English Channel. In addition, the grave goods are both richer and more numerous in Kentish graves, implying that material wealth was derived from that trade. Frankish influences <b>also</b> <b>may</b> be detected in the social and agrarian organization of Kent. Other cultural influences may be seen in the burials as well, so {{it is not necessary to}} presume that there was direct settlement by the Franks in Kent.|$|E
5|$|Representations of lions {{date back}} to the early Upper Paleolithic. The lioness-headed ivory carving from Vogelherd cave in the Swabian Alb in southwestern Germany, dubbed Löwenmensch (lion-human) in German. The {{sculpture}} has been determined to be at least 32,000years old from the Aurignacian culture, but it may date to as early as 40,000 years ago. The sculpture has been interpreted as anthropomorphic, giving human characteristics to an animal, however, it <b>also</b> <b>may</b> represent a deity. Two lions were depicted mating in the Chamber of Felines in 15,000-year-old Paleolithic cave paintings in the Lascaux caves. Cave lions also are depicted in the Chauvet Cave, discovered in 1994; this has been dated at 32,000years of age, though it may be of similar or younger age to Lascaux.|$|E

5|$|River otters {{can produce}} a snarling growl or hissing bark when bothered, and a shrill whistle when in pain. When at play or traveling, they {{sometimes}} give off low, purring grunts. The alarm call, given when shocked or distressed by potential danger, is an explosive snort, made by expelling air through the nostrils. River otters <b>also</b> <b>may</b> use a birdlike chirp for communication over longer distances, but the most common sound heard {{among a group of}} otters is low-frequency chuckling.|$|E
5|$|The {{archipelago}} also {{is known}} as 'The Seven Hunters'. During the Middle Ages they <b>also</b> <b>may</b> have been called the 'Seven Haley (Holy) Isles'. Martin Martin (1703) lists a number of unusual customs associated with regular pilgrimages to Eilean Mòr, such as removing one's hat and making a sunwise turn when reaching the plateau. It {{is possible that the}} saint or his acolytes lived on Eilean Mòr and perhaps, on Eilean Taighe as well. It is unlikely, however, that there were permanent residents on the islands once the Celtic Church fell into decline in the Hebrides (as a result of ninth century Viking invasions), until the construction of the lighthouse and its occupation very shortly before the dawn of the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|The event <b>also</b> <b>may</b> {{have served}} as a {{symbolic}} exorcism of Charles's mental illness at a time when magicians and sorcerers were commonly consulted by members of the court. In the early 15th century, ritual burning of evil, demonic, or Satanic forces was not uncommon as shown by Orléans's later persecution of the King's physician Jehan de Bar, who was burned to death after confessing, under torture, to practicing sorcery.|$|E
