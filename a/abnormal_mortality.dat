40|$|In France {{abnormal}} mortalities of mollusks affect {{many species}} of bivalves. They occur mainly in summer and concern all the French coastline. For Crassostrea gigas, they affect all life's stages but more particularly spat. A pathology monitoring network, REPAMO, was created {{at the beginning of}} the nineties in France in order to answer European requirements as regards mollusk pathology. REPAMO observes whether there is <b>abnormal</b> <b>mortality</b> and keeps track of the health situation of mollusk stocks including the presence of pathogens notifiable to the European Union and OIE. When mortalities occur, the network REPAMO, samples the populations and performs different types of analysis (histology, bacteriology, viral detection) in order to detect potential pathogens. In France, different agents have been sometimes associated with abnormal mortalities of bivalves such as herpes-virus in Crassostrea gigas. Bacterial agents can be also involved. Indeed hemolymph of moribund oysters from open sea and from hatchery are often invaded by one Vibrio species belonging to V. splendidus group or V. aestuarianus.

No inflammation or pathological alterations were observed, and the oysters appeared in good health. A Bonamia specific Real-time PCR was performed on all 150 specimens from Langestrand in the spring and 16 specimens from Hui where “microcells” were observed in the spring sample. Microcytos specific Real-time PCR and nested PCR were performed on the 16 oysters from Hui, and 18 oysters from Langestrand, where the microcells were observed in the spring sampling. All samples were negative with both assays, and the observed cells are therefore not interpreted as Bonamia sp. or Microcytos sp. One additional mussel sample was included, after a report of <b>abnormal</b> <b>mortalities</b> in several mussel farms in Åfjorden, Trøndelag. No pathogens or pathological alterations were observed. Very few flat oysters were observed at Hui in Vestfold, indicating that the populations in this area are low.

40|$|In Argentina, {{especially}} in San Matias Gulf, oyster {{culture is a}} recent activity. Culture of native flat oyster, Ostrea puelchana (d'Orbigny, 1842), was particularly promising until an <b>abnormal</b> <b>mortality</b> occurred in 1996. Preliminary diagnosis, based on histology, revealed the presence of Bonamia-like cells in some individuals. In order to identify the pathological agent apparently involved in this mortality and to quantify its impact on natural beds, 42 batches of 30 individuals were sampled on natural beds and culture areas between years 1996 and 2001. Samples were analyzed by traditional techniques including heart imprints and histology, complemented by PCR and in situ hybridization. Histology and heart imprints revealed the presence of Bonamia-like cells in connective tissue of O. puelchana, free or within haemocytes, mainly in gills, digestive gland, stomach, intestine and gonad. PCR and in situ hybridization confirmed the belonging of the parasite to the genus Bonamia. Cultivated oysters and close natural beds presented highest frequency of parasite detection (50 - 60 %) when mortality was maximal (October 1997). Subsequently, prevalence decreased slowly until 2000 and increased again from 6 % to 10 % between 2000 and 2001. Spatial and temporal propagation of the parasite was observed from culture areas to natural beds during two time intervals (1997 - 1999 and 2000 - 2001). Now, it needs to characterize this new microcell from molecular and ultrastructural point of views {{in order to assess}} it taxonomic relationships with other Bonamia species...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an osteoarchaeological analysis of juvenile mortality profiles questioning the speculations made by some archaeologists that the under-representation of infants from Anglo-Saxon and medieval burial populations {{could be due}} to the practice of infanticide in England during these periods. Morphological and metrical age estimation and sex assessment methods are used to determine the age-at-death and sex of 1275 children from fifty-three Anglo-Saxon and medieval sites located in southern England. The age and sex distribution of the Anglo-Saxon and medieval children under six-years-old are then compared with age-specific United Nations demographic statistics see to whether or not a normative mortality profile is presented by the archaeological populations. This study identified an abnormal age-at-death distribution for the early Anglo-Saxon perinatal individuals. Excess female mortality was observed for the perinatal individuals from all three periods; early Anglo-Saxon, late Anglo-Saxon and medieval, and for the neonatal and infant individuals from the early Anglo-Saxon and medieval periods. The results of this osteoarchaeological analysis are discussed in conjunction with a review of the Anglo-Saxon and medieval documentary evidence which examines the possible social and economic motives for infanticide. Whilst this analysis of the historical sources revealed laws and penitentiary warnings against the neglect and deliberate murder of infants, the late Anglo-Saxon and medieval documents provided little evidence to suggest the social devaluation of women that would support a hypothesis of preferential female infanticide. There are few surviving early Anglo-Saxon documents however, so the significance of the <b>abnormal</b> <b>mortality</b> profiles from this period is considered.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of OsHV- 1, a herpes virus causing mass mortality in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas was investigated {{with the aim}} to select individuals with different susceptibility to the infection. Naïve spat transferred to infected areas and juveniles currently being grown at those sites were analyzed using molecular and histology approaches. The survey period distinguishes itself by very warm temperatures reaching up to 3. 5 °C above the average. The virus was not detected in the virus free area although a {{spread of the disease}} could be expected due to high temperatures. Overall mortality, prevalence of infection and viral load was higher in spat confirming the higher susceptibility in early life stages. OsHV- 1 and oyster mortality were detected in naïve spat after 15 days of cohabitation with infected animals. Although, infection was associated with mortality in spat, the high seawater temperatures could also be the direct cause of mortality at the warmest site. One stock of juveniles suffered an event of <b>abnormal</b> <b>mortality</b> that was significantly associated with OsHV- 1 infection. Those animals were infected with a previously undescribed microvariant whereas the other stocks were infected with OsHV- 1 μVar.

Survivors from the natural outbreak were exposed to OsHV- 1 μVar by intramuscular injection and were compared to naïve animals.

40|$|The French {{network for}} the {{surveillance}} and monitoring of mollusc health (REPAMO) was officially {{set up in}} 1992 to control the shellfish status along the French coasts according to the European directives 91 / 67 /EEC and 95 / 70 /EC. The objectives are 1) the surveillance of notifiable diseases present in France (Bonamiosis and Marteiliosis of flat oysters Ostrea edulis), 2) the surveillance of health status of cultured and wild populations of molluscs, 3) the study of <b>abnormal</b> <b>mortality</b> and 4) the control of exchanges from European and third countries. In this context, a new surveillance programme, called Active Targeted Survey, part of the REPAMO, was applied in 2004 {{in order to improve}} the monitoring of the health status of the French mollusc populations (objective 2). The objective is to provide evidence of freedom regarding notifiable exotic diseases (OIE list and directive 95 / 70 /EC annexe D) in susceptible host species. The new strategy, designed from data collected between 1990 and 2002 on the main harvested and farming species, is an active surveillance approach targeting a new mollusc species every two years. The sampling strategy including sampling method, sampling points, frequency, is defined according to the objective, the mollusc species and the targeted pathogen. In the context of this new strategy we have chosen to start with perkinsosis in clams along the French coasts. We present the theoretical approach and the data collected in 2004 - 2005 for clam species (Ruditapes decussatus and R. philippinarum) regarding infection with the protozoan Perkinsus olseni.

40|$|Aquaculture faces many threats, {{including}} diseases, {{of which}} some are notifiable under current UK regulation, e. g. {{infectious salmon anaemia}} (ISA) and infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN). <b>Abnormal</b> <b>mortality</b> is one possible indicator {{of the presence of}} infectious disease on a site that may be used, by the regulator, as a surveillance alert that allows them to identify possible notifiable diseases and to activate measures of control {{to reduce the risk of}} spreading those diseases. Therefore, mortality records at the farm level may be a useful indicator for regulatory surveillance purposes in order to identify potential disease outbreaks. In the UK, regulators and producers have discussed abnormal rates of mortality that may be considered as a trigger to notify the official regulator. In our study, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) approach was used on mortality data from production cycles of a site production database of marine Atlantic salmon belonging to a single company. The usefulness of these data in helping the detection of infectious diseases was determined using measures of sensitivity and specificity. For fish under 750 g, the abnormal rates of mortality did not provide a strong indication of the presence of disease. The area under the curve (0 ≤ AUC ≤ 1) values were generally low with the exception of cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS) that showed AUC = 0. 77 for weekly mortality and AUC = 0. 73 for five-week rolling mortality. However, abnormal levels of mortality for fish with weight over 750 g provided a strong indication of the presence of disease with the exception of both suspected and confirmed IPN. The probabilities of triggering official notification were low since mortality events over the percentages proposed happened infrequently. The most efficient trigger will be for weekly mortality (1 %) for fish with weight over 750 g since abnormal mortalities in such large fish are more likely to be associated with the presence of disease...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMassive {{mortality}} outbreaks, mostly affecting spat Crassostrea gigas, {{have been}} reported in France since 2008. Disease investigations revealed that most of the mortality events are related to the detection of the Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV- 1 μVar). Meanwhile, selection to improve the survival in juvenile C. gigas has been successfully implemented in this context and selected oysters were found disease-resistant to OsHV- 1 infection. This paper reports the first investigation of the horizontal transmission of the disease throughout cohabitation trials within batch and between batches using unselected and selected oysters for their higher survival. Two batches, unselected (AC) and selected (AR), were produced in February 2009 and deployed in the field in August 2009. Mortality associated with OsHV- 1 detection occurred within {{the first two weeks of}} the deployment to reach 19 % and 56 % for the AR and AC batches, respectively. The remaining alive oysters were then brought into the laboratory in March 2010 for the cohabitation trials to assess the potential horizontal transmission of OsHV- 1 within batch or between one of the batches and a third. The third batch (J) was produced using unselected oysters in August 2009 and it was always kept in the hatchery and the nursery to isolate it from the mortality risk factors. At the end of the cohabitation trials in July 2010, no mortality was found for the cohabitation trials between AR and J oysters as well as for the AR oysters and also for the J oysters grown alone in a tank. Conversely, high mortality was reported for the cohabitation trials using the J and AC batches as well as for the AC oysters alone. For the later, mortality occurred 3 days post-spawning while the AR oysters, which also spawned the same day, did not suffer of any <b>abnormal</b> <b>mortality.</b> Disease screening revealed that OsHV- 1 was not detected for the J batch in March 2010, while 4 and 46 % of the AR and AC oysters were found positive seven months post-mortality, indicating a difference in potential reservoir role within the C. gigas species. Our study clearly revealed the horizontal transmission of the disease from unselected asymptomatic adult to juvenile C. gigas, inducing mortality, and that OsHV- 1 resistant oysters may offer one way to limit the spread of the disease and the potential reservoir role. Mortality due to OsHV- 1 and its kinetic depended of the seawater temperature, which appeared as a strong risk factor that can reactivate the virus from latent-like or sub-clinical infection in asymptomatic adults. The lower threshold of 14 °C to observe mortality due to OsHV- 1 was evidenced even if its replication was activated during the two previous weeks when seawater temperature was 16 °C. Finally, a sub-clinical level of virus was observed in AC asymptomatic oysters, it can be reactivated and cause viral replication, suggesting latency-like infection can exist in OsHV- 1...|$|E
40|$|With 7 {{figures and}} 1 table ABSTRACT. Coastal lagoons are {{important}} reservoirs of continental material where, as a rule, exceptional conditions of primary production prevail. This exceptional primary production may itself disrupt these ecosystems, leading to dystrophic phenomena. Part of the accumulated allochthonous and autochthonous material is exported from lagoon to the sea, from which an important biological component is imported in return. It {{is known that}} interactions between sea and lagoon environments are of major importance to lagoonal biogeochemical and ecological cycles. St. André is an enclosed coastal lagoon, connected to the sea only for {{short periods of time}} (March/April) through a man-made channel. According to the magnitude of episodic freshwater and seawater inputs in winter, anoxic conditions in the stagnant bottom water may develop. High concentrations of nutrients, dissolved iron and dissolved manganese were measured in this water layer. It was found that the opening of the lagoon to the sea causes chemical modifications in the lagoon. Such changes appear to be related to hydrological and meteorological conditions over winter. As nutrients and other degradation products from the bottom are prevented from recycling within the lagoon, near-bottom reduced conditions may cause considerable damage, especially by eutrophication. Due to the strong reducing near-bottom conditions in 1986, sea-lagoon exchanges caused sharp chemical changes which in turn led to <b>abnormal</b> fish <b>mortality</b> in the lagoon...|$|R

The method consisted in a combination of temporal regression and spatial cluster detection which allows identifying, for a given week, clusters of spatial units showing an excess of deaths in comparison with their own historical fluctuations. First, we simulated 1, 000 outbreaks of a disease causing extra deaths in the French cattle population (about 200, 000 herds and 20 million cattle) according to a model mimicking the spreading patterns of an infectious disease and injected these disease-related extra deaths in an authentic mortality dataset, spanning from January 2005 to January 2010. Second, we applied our algorithm on each of the 1, 000 semi-synthetic datasets to identify clusters of spatial units showing an excess of deaths considering their own historical fluctuations. Third, we verified if the clusters identified by the algorithm did contain simulated extra deaths in order to evaluate the ability of the algorithm to identify unusual mortality clusters caused by an outbreak. Among the 1, 000 simulations, the median duration of simulated outbreaks was 8 weeks, with a median number of 5, 627 simulated deaths and 441 infected herds. Within the 12 -week trial period, 73 % of the simulated outbreaks were detected, with a median timeliness of 1 week, and a mean of 1. 4 weeks. The proportion of outbreak weeks flagged by an alarm was 61 % (i. e. sensitivity) whereas one in three alarms was a true alarm (i. e. positive predictive value).

There are conflicting data describing the influence of birth site on outcome after HIE - and no published data from South Africa. Objective: To compare the frequency of <b>abnormal</b> outcome (<b>mortality</b> or <b>abnormal</b> aEEG) before discharge between inborn and outborn infants treated with hypothermia Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of data extracted from a prospectively collated registry of babies with moderate or severe HIE, treated with hypothermia in a tertiary hospital in South Africa, between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2012. Results: A total of 57 babies were treated with hypothermia of which 23 (40 %) were inborn and 34 (60 %) outborn. Cooling was initiated earlier among the inborn babies (age 2. 3 hours vs. 4. 3 hours, p= 0. 002). Pregnancy complications and abnormal intrapartum fetal heart rates occurred more frequently in inborn infants (65. 2 % vs. 24. 2 %, p= 0. 0001 and 47. 8 % vs. 20. 6 %, p = 0. 03 respectively). More outborn babies died or had an abnormal aEEG at 48 hours (32 % vs. 22 %, p= 0. 556) and fewer outborn babies achieved normal feeding at discharge (22 % vs. 38 %, p = 0. 189), but these differences were not statistically significant.

40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} develop a novel, safe and {{immunogenic}} fowl typhoid (FT) vaccine candidate, a Salmonella Gallinarum ghost with controlled expression of the bacteriophage PhiX 174 lysis gene E was constructed using pMMP 99 plasmid in this study. The formation of the Salmonella Gallinarum ghost with tunnel formation and loss of cytoplasmic contents was observed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. No viable cells were detectable 24 [*]h after the induction of gene E expression {{by an increase in}} temperature from 37 [*]°C to 42 [*]°C. The safety and protective efficacy of the Salmonella Gallinarum ghost vaccine was tested in chickens that were divided into four groups: group A (non-immunized control), group B (orally immunized), group C (subcutaneously immunized) and group D (intramuscularly immunized). The birds were immunized at day 7 of age. None of the immunized animals showed any adverse reactions such as <b>abnormal</b> behavior, <b>mortality,</b> or signs of FT such as anorexia, depression, or diarrhea. These birds were subsequently challenged with a virulent Salmonella Gallinarum strain at 3 [*]weeks post-immunization (wpi). Significant protection against the virulent challenge was observed in all immunized groups based on mortality and post-mortem lesions compared to the non-immunized control group. In addition, immunization with the Salmonella Gallinarum ghosts induced significantly high systemic IgG response in all immunized groups. Among the groups, orally-vaccinated group B showed significantly higher levels of secreted IgA. A potent antigen-specific lymphocyte activation response along with significantly increased percentages of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T lymphocytes found in all immunized groups clearly indicate the induction of cellular immune responses. Overall, these findings suggest that the newly constructed Salmonella Gallinarum ghost appears to be a safe, highly immunogenic, and efficient non-living bacterial vaccine candidate that protects against FT. </p...|$|R

We are thus currently working on a timely and automated system to monitor cadaver disposal requests received by rendering plants, thanks to a data interchange system recently implemented between the Ministry of Agriculture and the fallen stock companies. Besides technical and methodological challenges, using these data for surveillance purposes raises epidemiological questions that still need to be answered. The question remains notably as to whether an <b>abnormal</b> increased <b>mortality</b> is a sensitive and timely signal for detecting unexpected health events. It appears also very challenging to identify the most adequate surveillance scale (time, space and population) and the most adequate anomaly detection algorithms to apply when the characteristics of the signals to be detected (shape, amplitude, etc.) are not known a priori. In Human health, similar systems have not yet proven their ability to detect unexpected events earlier than classical surveillance systems currently in place, but they have already demonstrated their value for real time assessment of identified and potentially dangerous events. Combined with traditional surveillance systems, we think that monitoring routinely collected data could improve the surveillance of the animal population health. Even if not used for detection purposes, cattle mortality monitoring could be used to rapidly produce information on the impact and evolution of identified events, what would facilitate decision-making regarding management measures and improve the communication...|$|R
40|$|Buah Merah (Pandanus conoideus Lam), is an endemic plant from Papua and its surrounding. Oil of buah merah {{known and}} claimed for cancer, HIV/AIDS, lung tuberculosis, {{diabetic}} and decreased blood cholesterol treatment. Since buah merah oil widlly {{is used in}} communities, safety test is needed. There were no toxic effects as <b>abnormal</b> behavior or <b>mortality</b> in rats, even using in high dose of, 5 ml/ 200 g body weight or approximately 9. 4 times of human dose (1 x HD= 30 ml). Due to this situation, the acute toxicity {{has been done by}} Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Research and Development Center, at 2006. The result showed that qualitative test based on chemical group compounds, triterpenoid, phenol and steroid have been found clearly. Basically the oil is not toxic for single dose. Since there's no mortality, the LD 5 o will be considered as pseudo LD 5 o. that means that doses of 5 ml/ 200 g body weight of Wistar rat is safe for utilization, or the safety dose for human will bein a very large range.   Key words: Buah Merah, Pandanus conoideus Lam, Characterization, Acute toxicit...|$|R
40|$|The {{modernisation}} {{paradigm is}} here tested and found wanting {{in a very}} particular context; {{the experience of the}} migrant. Women in South Asia have a biologically <b>abnormal</b> chance of <b>mortality</b> from conception until their mid- 30 s. This phenomenon is thought to be related to a range of economic and cultural factors, which include sex-selective abortion and gender-biased allocations of health care and nutrition. There is scant research on the manifestation of this phenomenon after migration to developed countries. The modernisation paradigm suggests that migrants will quickly adopt the norms of the host developed country. Some of the proximate causes that generate the excess mortality of females in South Asia are, indeed, not likely to be operational in a developed country; namely, female infanticide and deprivation of nutrition and health care for girls. However, the cultural preference for sons in South Asia has persisted following migration, while the specific way in which this preference is satisfied has changed: sex-selective abortion is replacing post-natal neglect of, and harm done to, girls and women. In some cases, further empirical work is required if the issue of ho...|$|R
40|$|An avian {{toxicity}} {{study in}} the Japanese quail was conducted with Bis-(tributyltin) -oxide (TBTO). Test diets containing 0, 150 and 375 ppm were fed for a 13 -week period followed by a 3 -week recovery period. The animals of each dose group were housed either single or in pairs. The test animals were observed daily for <b>mortality,</b> <b>abnormal</b> behavior, and signs of toxicity. Body weight, food consumption, egg production, eggshell thickness, fertility, hatchability, number and weight of chicks also were measured. No treatment related mortality occured and no signs of intoxication were observed in any group. Changes of phosphate and iron levels were measured in blood plasma of female adults only. Egg production (number of eggs, mean egg weight), eggshell thickness and quality, fertility, hatchability were reduced at 375 ppm. The 6 week reproduction test has shown similar effects of TBTO which were obtained during the 13 week period. All toxic effects were reversible 3 weeks after termination of TBTO feeding. In animals housed either single or in pairs the reproductive effects of TBTO were almost identical. Nevertheless single housing of Japanese quails should be preferred because housing in pairs showed {{a greater degree of}} injuriesSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: RN 8908 (93 - 025) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit, Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R
40|$|The {{respiratory}} {{responses and}} tolerance of hypoxia were studied in two marine teleosts, the red grouper (Epinephelus akaara, a sluggish species) {{and the black}} sea bream (Mylio macrocephalus, an active species). Neither species showed <b>abnormal</b> behaviour or <b>mortality</b> when exposed to 2 mg O 2 l- 1 for 7 h. The black sea bream was, however, comparatively more tolerant when exposed to 1 mg O 2 l- 1, but tolerance of both species became similar under extremely hypoxic conditions (i. e. 0. 5 mg O 2 l- 1). In contrast to most other teleosts, both species showed a reduction in opercular beating rate during hypoxia, and oxygen conformity {{was found in the}} range of 0. 5 to 7. 0 mg O 2 l - 1. O 2 dissociation curves were constructed, and the P 50 value of the black sea breams (27 ± 5. 6 mm Hg) was found to be much lower than that of the red groupers (50 ± 2. 5 mm Hg). For both species, the general levels of venous PO 2 showed a direct relationship to ambient PO 2, and were markedly reduced after 1 h exposure to various levels of hypoxia. Compared with the red groupers, the black sea breams appeared to be more able to maintain its venous PO 2 levels during prolonged hypoxic exposure. © 1984 Dr W.

40|$|Note: Figures for Lapointe et al are {{included}} {{at the end}} of this paper. ] Late-run stocks are unique among Fraser River sockeye salmon populations in that they typically delay in Georgia Strait 4 to 6 weeks prior to migrating upstream to spawn. Beginning in 1995, and continuing through 2002, this delay period to 6 weeks earlier than normal. Each year, the early river entry has been associated with high rates of en-route and pre-spawning mortality (> 90 % in 2000 and 2001). The <b>abnormal</b> behavior and <b>mortality</b> was less extreme in 2002 than the prior two years and results from a radio tagging program indicated that individual late-run sockeye exhibited a range of behaviors from little or no delay to near normal delay. The abnormal behavior and subsequent mortality is already threatening the viability of small populations (e. g. Cultus Lake sockeye). The Pacific Salmon Commission has held workshops and funded several studies to begin investigating the causes of this behavior. Many competing hypotheses have been proposed (e. g. involving physiology, environmental conditions, contaminants, parasites, and predators) regarding the reason(s) for early migration and high mortality. However, the cause of the behavior and mortality remain unknown. Precautionary management actions have resulted in large foregone catches of late-run and summer-run sockeye populations that co-migrate with late-run stocks in the fishing areas (e. g. Adams and Horsefly River sockeye). Similar behavior has been observed in other Fraser River salmon species, but the high mortality rates have not yet been observed...|$|R
40|$|Background—The {{ability of}} the Naughton-Balke {{exercise}} treadmill test, an objective indicator of exercise capacity, to predict <b>abnormal</b> hemodynamics and <b>mortality</b> in pulmonary hypertension is unknown. Methods and Results—We performed a cohort study of 603 patients with pulmonary hypertension from 1982 to 2006, and studied the utility of exercise treadmill test {{as a predictor of}} abnormal hemodynamics and death. We used multivariable linear regression to determine whether exercise capacity, measured in metabolic equivalents, was associated with abnormal hemodynamics, and we used a Cox proportional hazards model to determine whether decreased exercise capacity predicted death. Mean age was 5015 years, 76 % were women, 63 % had World Health Organization category I pulmonary arterial hypertension, and 23 % were World Health Organization functional classes I and II. Mean exercise capacity was 3. 72. 2 metabolic equivalents. Decreased exercise capacity was independently associated with elevated right atrial and mean pulmonary artery pressure, decreased cardiac index, and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. During median follow-up of 4. 6 years, 36 % of the patients died. Decreased exercise capacity was associated with mortality (multivariable hazard ratio, 1. 18; 95 % CI, 1. 01 to 1. 37 for each 1 -metabolic equivalent decrease in exercise capacity; P 0. 031; P 0. 052 after adjusting for invasive hemodynamic variables). Decreased exercise capacity also predicted mortality in functional classes I–II patients, 24 % of whom died (hazard ratio, 1. 53; 95 % CI, 1. 04 to 2. 26 for each 1 -metabolic equivalent decrease in exercise capacity; P 0. 032), although this association did not persist afte...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the prevalence, incidence of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), and mortality during anti-TB treatment in patients multi-infected with HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and hepatitis virus (hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV)). Methods: Three hundred and sixty-one HIV-positive TB patients were enrolled and divided into an HIV/TB group, HIV/TB/HBV group, and HIV/TB/HCV group; 1013 HIV-negative TB patients were selected randomly as controls. Results: One hundred and seventeen (32. 4 %) HIV-positive TB patients were infected with HBV and/or HCV, compared with 90 (8. 9 %) HIV-negative TB patients (p =  0. 000). HIV-positive TB patients {{had a higher}} incidence of anti-TB drug-induced hepatotoxicity than HIV-negative TB patients (4. 2 % vs. 1. 0 %, odds ratio (OR) 4. 348, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 935 – 9. 769, p =  0. 000). The incidence of abnormal LFTs in the HIV/TB/HBV group and HIV/TB/HCV group were significantly higher than in the HIV/TB group (40. 7 % vs. 11. 1 %, OR 5. 525, 95 % CI 2. 325 – 13. 131, p =  0. 000; 20. 0 % vs. 11. 1 %, OR 2. 009, 95 % CI 1. 057 – 3. 820, p =  0. 031). A total of 68. 4 % of patients with HBV-DNA > 1. 0  ×  105 copies/ml and 42. 9 % of patients with HCV-RNA > 1. 0  ×  105 copies/ml had abnormal LFTs. Twenty-three (19. 7 %) patients multi-infected with HIV, TB, and hepatitis virus died during anti-TB treatment. Conclusions: HIV, HBV, and HCV are risk factors for the development of <b>abnormal</b> LFTs and <b>mortality</b> during anti-TB treatment.

40|$|Received on 24 - 09 - 2012 Accepted on 07 - 10 - 2012 In {{traditional}} {{system of}} medicine {{the plant is}} extensively used for different ailments like intestinal and throat problems, general body pain, neuralgic disorders and tonic to brain, heart and liver. Further no scientific data {{is available on the}} nootropic activity of fruit extracts of this plant. Hence the present study was aimed to explore the nootropic activity of this plant in experimental animal like mice. Nootropic activity of alcoholic (AEFLC) and aqueous (AQEFLC) extracts of fruit of L. chinensis sonn was evaluated in Passive avoidance model (PAM) in mice, Diazepam induced amnesia model (DAM) in mice and Sodium nitrite induced hypoxia model (SHM) in mice. Piracetam was used as standard reference for the all above mentioned models. When these extracts are subjected for LD 50 studies none of them produced <b>abnormal</b> behaviour or <b>mortality</b> in mice even at the dose level of 2000 mg/Kg body weight. Three different doses like low (100 mg/Kg), medium (200 mg/Kg) and high (400 mg/Kg) doses selected for the present study. For evaluation of nootropic activity, the ALEFLC and AQEFLC were tested at different dose levels and all doses (except low dose of AQEFLC) have shown a significant nootropic effect noted by increased Step-down latency (SDL), decreased time spent in shock zone (TSZ) & number of errors (SDE) in PAM. A significant increase in inflexion ratio was noted with all doses of AEFLC and AQEFLC in DAM. In SHM, AEFLC and AQEFLC have shown a significant increase in time for cessation of respiration.
