During whiffling, some birds invert the aerodynamic mechanics of their body that normally provide lift—flying by turning their bodies upside down but with their necks twisted 180 degrees to keep their heads in <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> flying position—resulting in a rapid plummet, before a quick arrest of the fall by resuming <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> flying orientation.|$|E

5|$|As part of Oslo's bid to {{host the}} FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011, it was {{necessary}} to build <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> hill, as Holmenkollbakken only consists of a large hill. Several proposals were made, including converting Holmenkollbakken to <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> hill and building a large hill in Rødkleiva, or building a new hill in Holmenkollen and building a small hill in Rødkleiva. Alternatively, a new small hill could be built at the location of the demolished Midtstubakken, next to Holmenkollbakken. City Councilor for Culture Anette Wiig Bryn (Progress Party) supported building a large hill in Rødkleiva and reducing Holmenkollbakken to a small hill.|$|E
