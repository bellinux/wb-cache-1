Mixing at industrial scale is done in batches (dynamic mixing), inline or with help of static <b>mixers.</b> <b>Moving</b> <b>mixers</b> are powered with electric motors that operate at standard speeds of 1800 or 1500 RPM, which is typically much faster than necessary. Gearboxes are used to reduce speed and increase torque. Some applications require the use of multi-shaft mixers, in which a combination of mixer types are used to completely blend the product.|$|R

This notion generalizes the well-known game chromatic number of a graph. An extended model also takes into account relaxed colorings and <b>asymmetric</b> <b>move</b> sequences. Game-perfectness {{is defined as a}} game-theoretic variant of perfectness of a graph, and is generalized to digraphs. We examine upper and lower bounds for the game chromatic number of several classes of digraphs.

Overall, <b>asymmetric</b> partitioning <b>moves</b> an additional 49 % of execution time for an application to the cloud. With cloud resources being the cheaper resources, this will translate to cost savings for charges associated to CPU resources.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{tetracaine}} and nifedipine on asymmetric charge movement in rabbit muscle fibres were examined {{to investigate whether}} mammalian charge movement could be subdivided into several components. Tetracaine (0. 05 - 0. 2 mM) stopped contraction in every sternomastoid fibre examined (n = 9) and reduced the <b>asymmetric</b> charge (<b>moved</b> by depolarizing steps to 0 mV) by 15 % (S. E. of mean 3 %). Tetracaine {{had little effect on}} the charge moved at potentials more negative than the threshold potential (established {{in the absence of the}} drug). Application of the Ca 2 + channel blocker nifedipine (2 or 10 microM), reduced the mean maximum asymmetric charge to 50 % (+/- 4) of the control value in twenty-three sternomastoid fibres and to 32 % (+/- 5) in four soleus fibres. Increasing the concentration of nifedipine to 120 microM had little further effect. The charge moved at potentials more negative than - 60 mV was unaffected by nifedipine. A similar result was found with 30 microM-D 600 (two fibres). 10 microM-nifedipine completely blocked Ca 2 + currents (external [Ca 2 +] = 8 mM), but 0. 15 microM-nifedipine only had a small effect on either the Ca 2 + current or charge movement in the four fibres examined. Contractions could no longer be elicited in eleven of eighteen fibres within 6 min of the application of 2 or 10 microM-nifedipine. However, in the remaining seven fibres contractions could be elicited with unchanged thresholds over 30 min, even in the presence of 50 microM-nifedipine. Nifedipine did not noticeably effect q gamma. It is suggested that nifedipine might prevent contraction only when, for other reasons, the normal release of Ca 2 + from the sarcoplasmic reticulum has been disrupted and contraction is dependent on the inflow of external Ca 2 +. The amount of <b>asymmetric</b> charge <b>moved</b> by depolarizing steps was about 50 % greater with a holding potential of - 110 mV than with one of - 90 mV.

40|$|Migration {{choices of}} {{husbands and wives}} in a dynamic and {{developing}} country are studied {{in the context of}} an economic model of the household. Data are drawn from the second wave of the Malaysia Family Life Survey. Elxploiting the retrospective histories, we compare moves that take place before marriage with those made during the marriage; among the latter, moves that are made with the spouse are distinguished from those made alone. The evidence indicates that male mobility is primarily economic in motivation and related to labor market factors. Moves by women, however, seem to be more closely related to fertility or family considerations. Migration is apparently not simply an individual decision; the attributes of the spouse are an important influence on mobility, albeit in an <b>asymmetric</b> manner. <b>Moving</b> toward a broader definition of the household, we find the characteristics of the parents, parents-in-law, and also the (relative) age and gender of siblings all influence mobility in a rich, if complex, way. ...|$|R

We take literally one side of this analogy and study the shape and motion of a bump, wrinkle or ruck in a thin sheet in partial contact with a rough substrate in a gravitational field. Using a combination of experiments, scaling analysis and numerical solutions of the governing equations, we quantify the static shape of a ruck on a horizontal plane. When the plane is inclined, the ruck becomes <b>asymmetric</b> and <b>moves</b> by rolling only when the inclination of the plane reaches a critical angle, at a speed determined by a simple power balance. We find that the angle at which rolling starts {{is larger than the}} angle at which the ruck stops; i. e., static rolling friction is larger than dynamic rolling friction.

This conflict is called non-responsiveness. Most of those models share the features that when there is conflict, the optimal contract is pooling otherwise it is separating. In this note, we will show that, in fact, the robustness of the links between the conflict and separating contracts is not a general consequence of the common value models: it depends crucially on the assumption made in all those models that the principal's marginal benefit from trade with full information is not distorted by the presence of informational rents. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{motion of}} a ruck in a rug {{is used as}} an analogy to explain the role of dislocations in the {{deformation}} of crystalline solids. We take the analogy literally and study the shape and motion of a bump, wrinkle or ruck in a thin sheet in partial contact with a rough substrate in a gravitational field. Using a combination of experiments, scaling analysis and numerical solutions of the governing equations, we first quantify the static shape of a ruck on a horizontal plane. When the plane is inclined, the ruck becomes <b>asymmetric</b> and <b>moves</b> by rolling only when the the inclination of the plane reaches a critical angle. We find that the angle at which this first occurs {{is larger than the}} angle at which the ruck stops, i. e. static rolling friction is larger than dynamic rolling friction. Once the ruck is in motion, it travels at a constant speed proportional to the sine of the angle of inclination, a result that we rationalize in terms of a simple power balance. We conclude with a simple implication of our study for the onset of rolling motion at soft interfaces. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

The flow was analysed experimentally by using dye visualizations and streak photography. Flow characteristics such as vorticity fields and the transport of passive tracers were compared with numerical simulations. Observations revealed that thin layers of vorticity, created at the cylinder wall are advected by the primary dipole halves, which, while rolling up into compact patches, give rise to the formation of two new <b>asymmetric</b> dipoles that <b>move</b> away along curved trajectories. The structure of the vorticity distribution inside the dipole, before and after the collision, has been investigated.

40|$|Symmetry {{breaking}} {{is reported}} for continuous families of solitons in the nonlinear Schrödinger equation with a two-dimensional complex potential. This symmetry-breaking bifurcation is forbidden in generic complex potentials. However, {{for a special}} class of partially parity-time-symmetric potentials, such symmetry breaking is allowed. At the bifurcation point, two branches of asymmetric solitons bifurcate out from the base branch of symmetry-unbroken solitons. Stability of these solitons near the bifurcation point are also studied, and two novel stability properties for the bifurcated asymmetric solitons are revealed. One {{is that at the}} bifurcation point, zero and simple imaginary linear-stability eigenvalues of <b>asymmetric</b> solitons can <b>move</b> directly into the complex plane and create oscillatory instability. The other is that the two bifurcated asymmetric solitons, even though having identical powers and being related to each other by spatial mirror reflection, can possess different types of unstable eigenvalues and thus exhibit non-reciprocal nonlinear evolutions under random-noise perturbations.

40|$|SummaryDiverse {{cellular}} processes require microtubules to {{be organized}} into distinct structures, such as asters or bundles. Within these dynamic motifs, microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are frequently under load, but how force modulates these proteins’ function is poorly understood. Here, we combine optical trapping with TIRF-based microscopy to measure the force dependence of microtubule interaction for three nonmotor MAPs (NuMA, PRC 1, and EB 1) required for cell division. We find that frictional forces increase nonlinearly with MAP velocity across microtubules and depend on filament polarity, with NuMA’s friction being lower when moving toward minus ends, EB 1 ’s lower toward plus ends, and PRC 1 's exhibiting no directional preference. Mathematical models predict, and experiments confirm, that MAPs with <b>asymmetric</b> friction can <b>move</b> directionally within actively moving microtubule pairs they crosslink. Our findings reveal how nonmotor MAPs can generate frictional resistance in dynamic cytoskeletal networks via micromechanical adaptations whose anisotropy may be optimized for MAP localization and function within cellular structures...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{composed}} of two parts. The first part of the paper deals with an example of two firms theory game of entry. After specifying, the set of firms, the firms space of pure strategies and the profit functions, we consider different types of games with respect to the information structure and the sequence of move of the two firms. We present the impact of different assumptions on the probability distribution of the outcomes of the game. With respect to the information structure, there exist two types of games: the complete information games where information about firms entry cost is perfectly known by both firms and asymmetric information games in which firms entry cost is a private information. So every firm knows its own cost of entry and have a partial information about its opponent entry cost (opponent?s cumulative distribution function). Firms can participate either in a simultaneous move game or in a sequential move game. The combination {{of the nature of the}} structure of the information with the rule of move, gives arise to four games whose outcomes are different. We show that in some cases multiplicity of equilibria exists. The second part of the paper begins by showing how previous literatures have treated the problem of multiplicity of equilibria. We conclude that to come over this problem and to guarantee the uniqueness, like in einav(2003), one should use a sequential <b>move</b> <b>asymmetric</b> information game. Within the framework of domestic air transport within the European union, the sequential move doesn?t appear to be a realistic assumption and an appropriate empirical model of oligopoly market structure must estimate simultaneously the decision of all companies. Due to the fact that the simultaneous <b>move</b> <b>asymmetric</b> information entry game becomes computationally intractable for more than 2 firms, we decide to opt for the simultaneous move complete information entry game. To deal with the problem of multiplicity of equilibria we adopt the same approach as berry (1992). In our empirical model the firms profits are specified as a function of the demand characteristics of the market, as well as the equilibrium number of companies present in the market. Like in berry (1992) the model specification supports both types of heterogeneity: observable and unobservable. Four models estimations are performed: three of them stem from specific constraints on parameters and the last one is the most general one. A comparison between models is built to find the best fit data model...|$|R

Understanding particle-particle mixing is important for process modeling and optimization. Recent work has used X-ray particle tracking velocimetry (XPTV) to characterize the threedimensional (3 D) granular flow structures in a double screw mixer. However, visualizing the experimental 3 D data can be challenging. This study uses virtual reality to allow a user to “walk through” the intermeshing screws of a simulated double screw mixing process and watch individual particles as they travel through the mixer. As the particle <b>moves</b> through the <b>mixer,</b> a particle path line is used to follow its movement. The virtual environment allows the user to view the particle from any direction using the physical movement {{of his or her}} body, augmented by a Wii remote for navigation beyond the physical space. The Wii remote also provides options to pause or reverse, to zoom in or out, and to slow down or speed up particle motion. Furthermore, the interaction code is flexible enough to allow other input devices, such as the Microsoft Kinect sensor and voice recognition, to control the system.

5000|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} amongst global historians and even most military analysts that in fact, from a purely strategic point of view, the United states military was, in actual fact, losing the war on the battlefield explicitly despite its superior firepower and superior technology. Military historians and {{those who participated in}} the war note that indeed the full spread of United States military technology, numbers, and expertise was present during the war, all the way to its very end. Historians {{both inside and outside the}} military do not accept the idea of Vietnam Syndrome as being legitimate, and they often point out that the superiority in combat exhibited by the Viet Cong and the regular North Vietnamese Army was rooted in those forces' ability to be agile in ways the United States forces and South Vietnamese forces were never able to be. It is generally agreed that the victory of the communist forces in Vietnam actually did indeed come from their superior battlefield performance— not their technology nor even their numbers (millions of Vietnamese were killed, versus many thousands, but not millions, of United States or South Vietnamese troops), but in fact their superior tactics, coming from their perfecting of guerrilla warfare, sabotage, atypical and <b>asymmetric</b> battlefield <b>moves,</b> infiltration, etc., which did indeed both overwhelm and systematically outmanoeuvre the United States and US-supported forces. The general consensus is that the Communists in North Vietnam did genuinely win the war. There are those, therefore, that explicitly equate the Vietnam Syndrome with a similar narrative just prior-to, and during, Nazi Germany, in which the idea was spread that Germany hadn't actually lost World War One but had instead been [...] "stabbed in the back by" [...] forces from within that secretly wanted Germany to lose that war and to be weakened. That narrative, too, is today universally dismissed (and was dismissed in the years before the Nazis as well, but was central to the Nazis' own power during the Nazi reign).|$|R
40|$|The Vaseline-gap {{technique}} {{was used to}} record asymmetric charge movement in small segments of muscle fibres from the white sternomastoid or the soleus muscle of the rabbit. At 22 degrees C, non-linear ionic currents (Na+, K+, Cl-, Ca 2 +) were virtually eliminated for potential steps to 0 mV or below by specific blocking agents or ion substitution. A Boltzmann fit of charge movement (Q) vs. potential (V) produced the mean values Qmax = 15. 2 nC/microF, V = - 26. 8 mV and k = 15. 3 mV for twenty-three sternomastoid fibres, and 4. 8 nC/microF, - 32 mV and 13. 7 mV for seven soleus fibres. Qmax for the sternomastoid fibres {{was similar to that}} for other fast-twitch fibres when normalized by surface area rather than capacitance. Using a 55 ms step, the mean threshold potential (Vth) for contraction in twenty-eight fibres was - 25. 9 (+/- 2. 9) mV (+/- S. E. of mean), and the mean amount of charge moved (qth) at the threshold potential was 8. 5 (+/- 0. 4) nC/microF. In some contracting fibres, a component of charge movement was observed which was analogous to q gamma in amphibian muscle in its time course and potential dependence. Addition of 80 mM-sucrose to the external solution increased the speed of both the asymmetric charge movement and the charging of the linear capacitance of each fibre. The effect was reversible. A clear relation between the time course of these two parameters was established, and this strongly indicated {{that the majority of the}} asymmetric charge was located in the transverse tubular system or beyond. Moreover, it was shown that at 22 degrees C nearly all <b>asymmetric</b> charge <b>moved</b> in less than 0. 5 ms after depolarization of the T-system. Sucrose in the external solution affected the Q vs. V relation, steepening the curve and shifting it to more negative potentials, as well as slightly increasing Qmax. The actions of sucrose strongly suggest that it effectively dilates and/or shortens the transverse tubular system, probably by osmotic effects...|$|R

40|$|Flow-visualization {{studies of}} ogival, parabolic, and conical forebodies {{were made in}} a {{comprehensive}} investigation of {{the various types of}} flow patterns. Schlieren, vapor-screen, oil-flow, and sublimation flow-visualization tests were conducted over an angle-of-attack range from 0 deg. to 88 deg., over a Reynolds-number range from 0. 3 X 10 (6) to 2. 0 X 10 (6) (based on base diameter), and over a Mach number range from 0. 1 to 2. The principal effects of angle of attack, Reynolds number, and Mach number on the occurrence of vortices, the position of vortex shedding, the principal surface-flow-separation patterns, the magnitude of surface-flow angles, and the extent of laminar and turbulent flow for symmetric, asymmetric, and wake-like flow-separation regimes are presented. It was found that the two-dimensional cylinder analogy was helpful in a qualitative sense in analyzing both the surface-flow patterns and the external flow field. The oil-flow studies showed three types of primary separation patterns at the higher Reynolds numbers owing to the influence of boundary-layer transition. The effect of angle of attack and Reynolds number is to change the axial location of the onset and extent of the primary transitional and turbulent separation regions. Crossflow inflectional-instability vortices were observed on the windward surface at angles of attack from 5 deg. to 55 deg. Their effect is to promote early transition. At low angles of attack, near 10 deg., an unexpected laminar-separation bubble occurs over the forward half of the forebody. At high angles of attack, at which vortex asymmetry occurs, the results support the proposition that the principal cause of vortex asymmetry is the hydrodynamic instability of the inviscid flow field. On the other hand, boundary-layer asymmetries also occur, especially at transitional Reynolds numbers. The position of <b>asymmetric</b> vortex shedding <b>moves</b> forward with increasing angle of attack and with increasing Reynolds number, and moves rearward with increasing Mach number...|$|R
