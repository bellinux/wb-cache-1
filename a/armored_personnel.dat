5|$|After the Iraqi {{forces were}} defeated, the U.N. {{mandated}} that the U.S. withdraw from Iraq, ending the Gulf War. By {{the end of}} combat operations, the 24th Infantry Division advanced 260 miles and destroyed 360 tanks and other <b>armored</b> <b>personnel</b> carriers, 300 artillery pieces, 1,200 trucks, 25 aircraft, 19 missiles, and over 500 pieces of engineer equipment. The division took over 5,000 Iraqi prisoners of war while suffering only eight killed, 36 wounded, and five non-combat casualties.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{attack on}} the city was called off after the Iraqi {{occupants}} opened up with heavy fire, prompting the Saudis to reinforce the 7th Battalion with two more companies from adjacent Saudi units. The attempt to retake the city had been preceded by a 15-minute preparatory fire from U.S. Marine artillery. However Iraqi fire did manage to destroy one Saudi V-150 <b>armored</b> <b>personnel</b> carrier.|$|E
5|$|Ba {{asserted}} {{that he would}} not take orders from Americans. He also argued that sending the 13 M113 <b>armored</b> <b>personnel</b> carriers through the Cong Ba Ky Canal would enable the Viet Cong to retreat because it might take too much time. An argument broke out between Vann and Ba. Finally, Vann radioed Ziegler at the command post at Tan Hiep and told him to ask the commander of the ARVN 7th Infantry Division to order Ba to move toward Ap Bac immediately. Shortly afterwards, Ziegler returned with Dam's permission, and Ba was ordered to move his M113 carriers {{in the direction of the}} white smoke that was rising from the burning hamlet. The American advisers were quietly confident that Ba's M113s could turn the tide of battle; on previous occasions, Viet Cong fighters often fled from the battlefield as soon as M113 <b>armored</b> <b>personnel</b> carriers turned up. However, in contrast to previous engagements, Viet Cong commander Hoang had ordered the soldiers of the 261st and 514th Battalions to throw everything they had at the South Vietnamese, as retreat through the muddy rice fields would result in certain death.|$|E
50|$|The Division {{sustained}} battle casualties {{amounting to}} 104 killed, 899 wounded and 112 missing. German losses were estimated at {{in excess of}} 3,100 in total. The problem of obtaining infantry and <b>armored</b> replacement <b>personnel,</b> especially combat junior officers, was critical.|$|R
50|$|Under this doctrine, US tank {{crews of}} both {{armoured}} divisions and GHQ tank battalions {{were taught to}} fight tanks in tank on tank engagements. <b>Armored</b> Force <b>personnel</b> {{during and after the}} war criticised the infantry for using the GHQ tank battalions assigned to infantry divisions strictly as infantry support.|$|R

5|$|During {{the battle}} of Khafji, these {{upgraded}} T-55s survived impacts from MILAN anti-tank missiles. These divisions also had <b>armored</b> <b>personnel</b> vehicles such as the BMP-1, scout vehicles such as the BRDM-2, and several types of artillery. Also deployed along {{this portion of the}} front, though not chosen to participate in the invasion, were five infantry divisions that were under orders to remain in their defensive positions along the border.|$|E
5|$|In {{the five}} days between 25 February, the day FSB 31 fell, and 1 March, three major engagements took place. With {{the help of}} air strikes, ARVN {{destroyed}} 17 PT-76 and six T-54 tanks at a loss of three of its five M41 tanks and 25 <b>armored</b> <b>personnel</b> carriers (APC)s. On 3 March the South Vietnamese column encountered a PAVN battalion without supporting armor and, {{with the assistance of}} B-52 strikes, killed 400 PAVN.|$|E
5|$|The chassis {{formed the}} basis for the Sd.Kfz. 250 light <b>armored</b> <b>personnel</b> carrier. Approximately 14,000 were {{produced}} between 1938 and 1945, {{making it one of the}} most widely produced German tactical vehicles of the war. It participated in the Invasion of Poland, the Battle of France, the Balkans Campaign and fought on both the Western Front and the Eastern Front, in North Africa and in Italy.|$|E
50|$|Today the 92nd Armored Division is {{the only}} Iranian {{division}} that has enough tanks {{to be considered a}} true armored division, even by regional standards.

5|$|In the meantime, {{at about}} 11:00 am, 16 tanks, 2 <b>armored</b> <b>personnel</b> {{carriers}} and 30 cars {{had been sent}} from the Officer School of Armored and Mechanized Formations, a Poznań garrison, to protect the designated buildings, but no shots were exchanged {{between them and the}} insurgents. These soldiers engaged in friendly conversation with the protesters; some reports state that two tanks were seized and some troops disarmed. Then the Soviet General Konstantin Rokossovsky, the Minister of National Defense, who was then in command of all armed forces in Poland, decided to take personal control, and the situation changed dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Initially it {{was planned}} to use the Sd.Kfz. 10 as a towing vehicle for various light guns and trailers, but it was {{authorized}} {{as a substitute for}} the Sd.Kfz. 250 light <b>armored</b> <b>personnel</b> carrier in 1939. The Ausf. B model saw its use broadened to tow heavier weapons like the 5 cm PaK 38 as well as their ammunition trailers. They also served in the maintenance and supply companies of motorized and tank units. Nine were delivered to Romania in 1942 as tractors for anti-tank guns.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} attack, {{hundreds}} of policemen and army forces personnel and two <b>armored</b> <b>personnel</b> carriers were brought into Yerevan, positioned on Baghramyan Avenue surrounding the National Assembly building.

5|$|At 14:30 {{approximately}} 300 North Korean infantry {{came from}} the village of Tugok and concealed positions, striking B Company on Hill 125 just north of the road and east of Tugok. Two T-34 tanks surprised and knocked out the two leading Marine M26 Pershing tanks. Since the destroyed Pershing tanks blocked fields of fire, four others withdrew to better positions. Assault teams of B Company and the 1st Battalion with 3.5-inch rocket launchers rushed into action, took the tanks under fire, and destroyed both of them, as well as an <b>armored</b> <b>personnel</b> carrier following behind. The North Korean infantry attack was brutal and inflicted 25 casualties on B Company before reinforcements from A Company and supporting Army artillery and the Marine 81mm mortars helped repel it.|$|E

40|$|Noises and {{variations}} in ambient conditions {{experienced by the}} human body {{in the course of}} its employment have direct bearing on the performance efficiency of the crew. Tank crew has to wear bulky gears, and perform complex movements or assumes un-usual postures/positions. This necessitates that tank crew must be kept comfortable for safe and efficient performance during operations. Fatigue is generally caused by various sources of excitation, such as ground surface irregularities, characteristics of suspension, construction, of seat, environmental factors and anthropometry. The ergonomics study on vibrational effect and response of crew to it, noise effect and anthropometry have been carried out in detail prior to recommending the measures to reduce the fatigue effects caused.

50|$|When I {{went into}} the street, I saw a nightmarish spectacle. Red tracer bullets {{streaked}} through the night air. The four-story Savoy Hotel, illuminated by floodlights, was surrounded by troops, local police and border police in full battle regalia. Military vehicles, <b>armored</b> cars and <b>personnel</b> carriers clogged the surrounding streets. Red Magen David ambulance crews were administering first aid to wounded civilians on the sidewalks and gutters. Looking out to sea, the blinding light of magnesium flares revealed naval patrol boats cruising just off the beach.|$|R
50|$|The M256A1 fires {{a variety}} of rounds. The M829A2 APFSDS round was {{developed}} specifically to address the improved protection of a Russian T-72, T-80U or T-90 main battle tank equipped with Kontakt-5 Explosive Reactive Armor. Later, the M829A3 APFSDS round was introduced to improve its effectiveness against next generation ERA equipped tanks. As a counter to that, the Russian army introduced Relikt, the most modern Russian ERA, which is claimed to be twice as effective as Kontakt-5. Development of the M829 series is continuing with the M829A4 currently entering production. The Abrams also fires High-explosive anti-tank warhead shaped charge rounds such as the M830, {{the latest version of}} which (M830A1) incorporates a sophisticated multi-mode electronic sensing fuse and more fragmentation which allows it to be used effectively against <b>armored</b> vehicles, <b>personnel,</b> and low-flying aircraft. The Abrams uses a manual loader. The fourth tank crew member on the Abrams also provides additional support for maintenance, observation post/listening post (OP/LP) operations, and other tasks.|$|R
5|$|Large-scale American support began {{during the}} Kennedy Administration {{in the early}} 1960s, {{with the arrival of}} large numbers of the US Special Forces to help out in the field. The arrival of {{helicopters}} changed the nature of the battle considerably. Helicopters enabled South Vietnamese soldiers to quickly fly to almost any point in the country, leaving little time for a retreat. Throughout 1962, the combined forces were increasingly effective in routing the Viet Cong. These tactics, combined with the use of <b>armored</b> <b>personnel</b> carriers, took a heavy toll on various fledgling Viet Cong units. The lightly armed Viet Cong had no weaponry capable of stopping the armored carriers and inevitably were forced to flee, taking heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{half of all}} U.S. Apaches were {{deployed}} to Saudi Arabia following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. During Operation Desert Storm on 17 January 1991, eight AH-64As guided by four MH-53 Pave Low IIIs destroyed part of Iraq's radar network in the operation's first attack, allowing the attack aircraft to evade detection. The Apaches each carried an asymmetric load of Hydra 70 flechette rockets, Hellfires, and one auxiliary fuel tank. During the 100-hour ground war a total of 277 AH-64s took part, destroying 278 tanks, numerous <b>armored</b> <b>personnel</b> carriers and other Iraqi vehicles. One AH-64 {{was lost in the}} war, to a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) hit at close range, the Apache crashed but the crew survived.|$|E
5|$|One unique feature {{found on}} most MP 38 and MP 40 submachine guns was an aluminum, steel, or {{bakelite}} resting bar or support under the barrel. This {{was used to}} steady the weapon when firing {{over the side of}} open-top <b>armored</b> <b>personnel</b> carriers such as the Sdkfz 251 half-track. A handguard, made of a synthetic material derived from bakelite, was located between the magazine housing and the pistol grip. The barrel lacked any form of insulation, which often resulted in burns on the supporting hand if it was incorrectly positioned. The MP 40 also had a forward-folding metal stock, the first for a submachine gun, resulting in a shorter overall weapon when folded. However, this stock design was at times insufficiently durable for hard combat use.|$|E
5000|$|Hasbro did {{not produce}} many {{vehicles}} for the early series G.I. Joe. The [...] "Five Star" [...] Jeep illustrated {{was one of the}} few offered, beginning in 1965. It was of sturdy construction, available with a trailer, in which the searchlight was mounted; an M40 105 mm recoilless rifle was mounted in the position occupied by the searchlight in the provided photographs. The Sears exclusive version of the jeep did not have the green rims, but was otherwise identical. There was also a sand colored variant sold as Desert Patrol. Hasbro also produced a Crash Crew Fire Truck. Hasbro granted a licence to Irwin in 1967 to manufacture seven vehicles; a small jet fighter, jet helicopter, motorcycle and side car (in a couple of color combinations), DUKW amphibious truck, <b>armored</b> car, <b>personnel</b> carrier with mine sweeper, and a German staff car. These were of the blow-mold variety, and suffered from lack of detail, disproportionate scaling, and longevity as a result of the cheaper production method.|$|R
25|$|The M2 Bradley turret {{provides}} the EIFV with considerable firepower on a cheap M113 chassis, and {{allows it to}} engage <b>personnel,</b> <b>armored</b> vehicles and tanks, as well as low flying targets and helicopters. It has the same fire control and stabilization features on the M2 Bradley. The armament consists of the 25mm M242 chain gun with 800 rounds and an effective range of 3000 m, and a coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun with 2,100 rounds. Using armor-piercing rounds, the chain gun can engage armored vehicles and tanks. The turret also has a two-tube TOW launcher, capable of launching TOW II ATGM missiles, which can destroy most tanks at a maximum range of 3750 m, enabling the vehicle {{to be used in}} an anti tank role. The only major drawback is that the missiles can only be launched when the vehicle is stationary. In addition to the two missiles in the launcher are four more missiles, stowed away inside the vehicle. The turret is standard equipped with passive IR and thermal imaging equipment.|$|R
5000|$|The Switchblade is {{designed}} as an expendable UAV to increase precision firepower for platoon-sized infantry units. It is 2 ft long and weighs 6 lb including the carrying case and launcher, making it small and light {{enough for one}} soldier to carry. The Switchblade is folded up inside a tube with wings unfolding once it gets airborne. It can be controlled up to 10 km but its small size limits its endurance to 10 minutes. This makes it unsuited for scouting roles, but it is useful for inexpensively engaging long-range targets and assisting in relieving units pinned down by enemy fire. The Switchblade uses a color camera and GPS locating to identify, track, and engage targets, {{as well as being}} able to be pre-programmed on a collision course. Its warhead has an explosive charge equivalent to a 40mm grenade to destroy light <b>armored</b> vehicles and <b>personnel.</b> If a situation causes a strike to be called off, the operator can call off the Switchblade and re-target it. The aircraft is propelled by an electric engine, so its small size and silent flight makes it extremely difficult to detect or try to intercept, enabling it to close in on a target at [...] The Switchblade uses the same Ground Control Station (GCS) as other AeroVironment UAVs including the Wasp, RQ-11 Raven, and RQ-20 Puma. This creates commonality and the potential for teaming of longer-endurance small UAVs to recon for targets, then having the Switchblade attack once they are identified with the same controller.|$|R
