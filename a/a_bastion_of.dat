5|$|During Sa'ad Zaghloul's term as {{minister}} of education, {{before he went}} on to lead the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, further efforts were made to modify the educational policy of al-Azhar. While <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> conservatism in many regards, the mosque was opposed to Islamic fundamentalism, especially as espoused by the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928. The school attracted students from throughout the world, including students from Southeast Asia and particularly Indonesia, providing a counterbalance to the influence of the Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn enjoyed {{early success}} in Germany, {{where he also}} revived {{interest}} in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, and in his travels throughout Europe. He was particularly well received in Britain as a composer, conductor and soloist, and his ten visits there– during which many of his major works were premiered– form {{an important part of}} his adult career. His essentially conservative musical tastes set him apart from many of his more adventurous musical contemporaries such as Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, Charles-Valentin Alkan and Hector Berlioz. The Leipzig Conservatoire (now the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig), which he founded, became <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> this anti-radical outlook.|$|E
5|$|The Ottomans quickly {{transformed}} {{the city from}} <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> Christianity to a symbol of Islamic culture. Religious foundations were established to fund the construction of ornate imperial mosques, often adjoined by schools, hospitals, and public baths. The Ottoman Dynasty claimed the status of caliphate in 1517, with Istanbul remaining the capital of this last caliphate for four centuries. Suleiman the Magnificent's reign from 1520 to 1566 {{was a period of}} especially great artistic and architectural achievement; chief architect Mimar Sinan designed several iconic buildings in the city, while Ottoman arts of ceramics, stained glass, calligraphy, and miniature flourished. The population of Istanbul was 570,000 {{by the end of the}} 18th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} history of Gibraltar during World War II exemplifies Gibraltar's {{position as a}} British fortress since the early 18th century and as a vital factor in British military strategy, both as a foothold on the continent of Europe, and as <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> British sea power. During World War II, Gibraltar served {{a vital role in}} both the Atlantic Theatre and the Mediterranean Theatre, controlling virtually all naval traffic {{into and out of the}} Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of whiskey {{was certainly not}} a norm in the colonies in the early years. The upper echelon of colonial society looked down upon American whiskey up until {{the time of the}} American Revolution. Some even saw the harsh spirit as <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> debauchery in the American colonies. Whatever the sentiment, the Scottish, Irish, and Germans brought a taste for hard spirits from their homelands to the American colonies in the 1730s. These groups continued to produce hard spirits in imported stills, or stills based on Old World designs, in retaliation against the English economic controls.|$|E
5|$|A bailey, {{also called}} a ward, was a {{fortified}} enclosure. It {{was a common}} feature of castles, and most had at least one. The keep {{on top of the}} motte was the domicile of the lord in charge of the castle and <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> last defence, while the bailey was the home {{of the rest of the}} lord's household and gave them protection. The barracks for the garrison, stables, workshops, and storage facilities were often found in the bailey. Water was supplied by a well or cistern. Over time the focus of high status accommodation shifted from the keep to the bailey; this resulted in the creation of another bailey that separated the high status buildings– such as the lord's chambers and the chapel– from the everyday structures such as the workshops and barracks.|$|E
50|$|Historically, DuPage County was a {{stronghold of}} the Republican Party, and was {{reckoned}} as <b>a</b> classic <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> suburban conservatism, {{but like many}} suburban counties has trended Democratic in presidential years.|$|R

5000|$|Oakland County {{historically}} was a {{stronghold of}} the Republican Party, <b>a</b> classic <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> suburban conservatism. However, since the 1990s {{it has become}} more competitive and has voted for the Democratic candidate for President in the last six elections.|$|R
5|$|Oppenheimer brought {{together}} intellectuals {{at the height}} of their powers and from a variety of disciplines to answer the most pertinent questions of the age. He directed and encouraged the research of many well-known scientists, including Freeman Dyson, and the duo of Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee, who won a Nobel Prize for their discovery of parity non-conservation. He also instituted temporary memberships for scholars from the humanities, such as T. S. Eliot and George F. Kennan. Some of these activities were resented by a few members of the mathematics faculty, who wanted the institute to stay <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> pure scientific research. Abraham Pais said that Oppenheimer himself thought that one of his failures at the institute was being unable to bring together scholars from the natural sciences and the humanities.|$|E
5|$|Prison {{films of}} the pre-Code era often {{involved}} {{men and women who}} were unjustly incarcerated, and films set in prisons of the north tended to portray them as <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> solidarity against the crumbling social system of the Great Depression. Sparked by the real-life Ohio penitentiary fire on April 21, 1930, in which guards refused to release prisoners from their cells, causing 300 deaths, the films depicted the inhumane conditions inside prisons in the early 1930s. The genre was composed of two archetypes: the prison film and the chain gang film. In the prison film, large hordes of men move about in identical uniforms, resigned to their fate, they live by a well defined code. In the chain gang film, Southern prisoners were subjected to a draconian system of discipline in the blazing outdoor heat, where they were treated terribly by their ruthless captors.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{was drawn}} back into public service by the Old Court – New Court controversy. When {{legislation}} aimed at providing {{relief to the}} state's debtors was struck down by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, supporters of the legislation in the General Assembly passed a bill abolishing the Court and creating a new court, which they stocked with sympathetic justices. Opponents of the legislation held that the Assembly's action was unconstitutional, and for a time, both courts claimed authority as the court of last resort in the state. Though he had {{served as president of}} the New Court-backed Bank of the Commonwealth since its formation in 1820, Crittenden publicly identified himself with the Old Court supporters in April 1825. In the legislative election of 1825, friends called on Crittenden to seek election to the state House of Representatives. Many believed that he was the only Old Court supporter that commanded enough respect to win one of the two seats allotted to Franklin County, <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> the New Court. When Crittenden consented to run, New Court supporters nominated the state's Attorney General Solomon P. Sharp and Lewis Sanders, a prominent lawyer. Crittenden and Sharp were elected to the two seats.|$|E

The excavations suggest the following phases of the site: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{seat was}} held by the Progressive Conservatives from 1958 to 1973, and was <b>a</b> rare <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> Liberal {{strength}} in the province from 1973 to 1981. Lloyd Axworthy was the riding's representative from 1973 to 1979; for a time, {{he was the only}} Liberal in the legislature.|$|R
50|$|In 1786 Barinas {{state was}} {{established}} in the territories of the existing states of Barinas and Apure. The city became the capital of the state and <b>an</b> important <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> the patriots during the War of Independence. Cristóbal Mendoza, the first President of Venezuela, lived and practiced his profession in Barinas.|$|R
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the 1968 election, Labor campaigned heavily around its leader, and this resonated with voters; in surveys conducted {{in parts of the}} metropolitan area, 84% of respondents declared their approval of Dunstan. In a presidential-style election campaign, Hall and Dunstan journeyed across the state advocating their platforms, and the major issues were the leaders, the Playmander and the economy. Television saw its first major use in the election, and Dunstan, an astute public speaker, successfully mastered it. With his upbeat style, Dunstan also made an impact in the print media, which had long been <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> the LCL. Despite winning a 52% majority of the primary vote, and 54% of the two-party preferred count, Labor lost two seats, resulting in a hung parliament: the LCL and Labor each had 19 seats. Had 21 votes in the rural seat of Murray gone the other way, Labor would have retained power. The balance of power rested with the chamber's lone independent, Tom Stott, who was offered the speakership by the LCL in return for his support on the Assembly floor. Stott, a conservative, agreed to support the LCL.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the conflict, {{there was}} a local {{uprising}} in the city. Gaddafi's men crushed this uprising, resulting in a temporary peace during which many pro-Gaddafi forces fled to the city after the massive rebel gains of late August, turning the city into <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> sorts.|$|E
25|$|Pontus became {{important}} as <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> Byzantine Greek and Greek Orthodox civilization and attracted Greeks from all backgrounds (scholars, traders, mercenaries, refugees) {{from all over}} Anatolia and the southern Balkans, from the Classical and Hellenistic periods into the Byzantine and Ottoman. These Greeks of Pontus are generally referred to as Pontic Greeks.|$|E
50|$|Len Colter and {{his cousin}} Esau are {{adolescent}} members of the New Mennonite community of Piper's Run. Against their fathers' wishes, the boys attend a preaching where a trader named Soames is accused and stoned to death for his apparent involvement with <b>a</b> forbidden <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> technology known as Bartorstown.|$|R
25|$|The Empire State was {{politically}} divided, {{with a significant}} peace movement, particularly in the mid- to late-war years, {{as well as being}} <b>a</b> strong <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> Radical Republicans who favored harsh treatment of the rebelling Confederate States of America. New York provided a key member of the Lincoln Administration, as well as several important voices on Capitol Hill.|$|R
50|$|Paramārtha {{became a}} Buddhist monk in India and {{received}} support from royalty for his travels {{to spread the}} teachings of Buddhism. He most likely received royal patronage from Bālāditya II or Kumāragupta III. The Maukhari ruler Dhruvasena I may have also supported Paramārtha, as his kingdom was <b>a</b> well-known <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> the type of Yogācāra teachings advocated by Paramārtha.|$|R
25|$|Membership is {{concentrated}} {{primarily in the}} Northeast and Midwest. Pennsylvania, <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> the German Reformed tradition, has {{the largest number of}} members and churches. As of 2000, the state had over 700 congregations and over 200,000 members. The highest membership rates are in the states of Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, situated in the heartland of the American Congregationalist movement.|$|E
25|$|Ontario is Canada's leading {{manufacturing}} province, {{accounting for}} 52% {{of the total}} national manufacturing shipments in 2004. Ontario's largest trading partner is the American state of Michigan. , Moody's bond-rating agency rated Ontario debt at AA2/stable, while S rated it AA-. Dominion Bond Rating Service rated it AA(low) in January 2013. Long known as <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> Canadian manufacturing and financial solvency, Ontario's public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to be 37.5% in fiscal year 2017–2018, compared to 26% in 2007–2008.|$|E
25|$|In 1899, Count Andrey Sheptytsky became {{new head}} of the Greek Catholic Church. A Polonized nobleman from an old Ukrainian family, he adopted the Ukrainian {{language}} and a Ukrainophile orientation. Although Sheptytsky did not interfere in priests' personal activities and writings, he slowly purged the Church's hierarchy of Russophiles. Despite drawing some Ukrainophiles' criticism for the slow progression of his changes, under Sheptytsky's leadership the Church gradually ceased being <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> Russophilism and instead became a staunchly Ukrainophile one.|$|E
50|$|It {{is located}} atop a {{hill in the}} Marmilla region. The {{structure}} is complex, formed by an original central tower, built in the middle Bronze Age, to which later were added other four towers and <b>a</b> <b>bastion.</b> One <b>of</b> the four towers was subsequently sacrificed during a further intervention, that also saw, presumably, the edification of the mighty external wall of hexagonal shape.|$|R
50|$|The Scottish Rugby Union was <b>a</b> {{particular}} <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> amateurism {{and extreme}} care {{was taken to}} avoid the 'taint' of professionalism: a player rejoining the national team {{after the end of}} the Second World War applied to be issued with a new shirt and was reminded that he had been supplied with a shirt prior to the outbreak of hostilities.|$|R
50|$|It {{was built}} in the 12th century not only with {{religious}} functions, but also as <b>a</b> defensive <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> the quarter during the strife with the neighbouring ones of St. Saturnino and Navarrería. The military role is evident in the watch tower. In 1222 the original Romanesque church was destroyed by a fire, and was replaced by a new building, consecrated in 1231.|$|R
25|$|The {{launching}} {{of a conservative}} weekly journal of opinion in a country widely assumed to be <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> conservatism at first glance looks like a work of supererogation, rather like publishing a royalist weekly {{within the walls of}} Buckingham Palace. It is not that of course; if National Review is superfluous, it is so for very different reasons: It stands athwart history, yelling Stop, at a time when no other is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s, Lebanon {{enjoyed a}} period of {{relative}} calm, with Beirut-focused tourism and banking sector-driven prosperity. Lebanon reached the peak of its economic success in the mid-1960s – the country was seen as <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> economic strength by the oil-rich Persian Gulf Arab states, whose funds made Lebanon one of the world’s fastest growing economies. This period of economic stability and prosperity was brought {{to an abrupt halt}} with the collapse of Yousef Beidas' Intra Bank, the country's largest bank and financial backbone, in 1966.|$|E
25|$|The {{congress}} passed a resolution, urging Georgia {{to become the first}} UN-recognized State to recognize the Circassian Genocide. In May 2011, Georgia followed through and recognized the acts as a genocide. Soon after, the Chechen separatist government-in-exile announced that it commended Georgia's decision, and advocated pan-Caucasian solidarity, and Circassians, Georgians, Chechens and other Caucasian diaspora in European countries staged demonstrations to show their support. In appreciation for the Georgian recognition, the Georgian flag was seen flying in Nalchik, the capital of Kabardino-Balkaria, which had been <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> anti-Georgian sentiment before the recognition.|$|E
50|$|Smith's {{district}} was significantly altered in the 2003 Texas redistricting. While he {{lost most of}} the Hill Country to the 23rd District, {{he picked up a}} significant portion of Austin, including the area around the University <b>of</b> Texas, <b>a</b> traditional <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> liberalism. Smith won re-election with 62% of the vote, Smith's lowest winning percentage since his initial run in 1986.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> long-time <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> the Shannons Nationals Motor Racing Championships the 2011 season saw the Gold Star shift several events {{onto the}} International V8 Supercars Championship calendar, after {{occasional}} appearances at the Clipsal 500 {{and other major}} events. The series appeared on the program of V8 Supercar rounds at Winton, Symmons Plains, and, in a first for the category, Hidden Valley Raceway in the Northern Territory.|$|R
50|$|The Mount Greenwood {{area has}} a {{reputation}} as <b>a</b> historical <b>bastion</b> <b>of</b> the South Side Irish. Mount Greenwood has the fourth highest percent of self-reported Irish Americans in the United States. The area has historically been predominantly white and Mount Greenwood was the destination for many Chicagoans during the white flight of {{the latter half of the}} twentieth century. As recently as 1998, an African-American family moving into Mount Greenwood was a newsworthy item.|$|R
