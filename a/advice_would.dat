After being prohibited by the Japanese police from holding a concert, Ahn concluded that following Dr. Mauri's <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> be necessary {{in order to avoid the}} social barriers placed on the Koreans.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{considerable}} radius {{from the surface}} of the nuclear fireball, 0–3kilometers—largely depending on the explosion's height, yield and position of personnel—ducking and covering would offer negligible protection against the intense heat, blast and prompt ionizing radiation following a nuclear explosion. Beyond that range, however, many lives would be saved by following the simple advice, especially since at that range the main hazard is not from ionizing radiation but from blast injuries and sustaining thermal flash burns to unprotected skin. Furthermore, following the bright flash of light of the nuclear fireball, the explosion's blast wave would take from first light, 7 to 10 seconds to reach a person standing 3km {{from the surface of}} the nuclear fireball, with the exact time of arrival being dependent on the speed of sound in air in their area. The time delay between the moment of an explosions flash and the arrival of the slower moving blast wave is analogous to the commonly experienced time delay between the observation of a flash of lightning and the arrival of thunder during a lightning storm, thus at the distances that the <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> be most effective, there would be more than ample amounts of time to take the prompt countermeasure of 'duck and cover' against the blast's direct effects and flying debris. For very large explosions it can take 30 seconds or more, after the silent moment of flash, for a potentially dangerous blast wave over-pressure to arrive at, or hit, your position.|$|E

500|$|The {{book has}} been criticized for {{increasing}} the pressure many Chinese students already had to succeed in school, and for taking advantage of the widespread belief that admission into leading universities is necessary for success in life. Some critics have called the book [...] "boastful." [...] A 2001 study by a group of educators claimed that the strategies described in the book would not work for everyone even though they had worked for Liu, and that many families following the book's <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> be disappointed.|$|E
500|$|In a {{critical}} letter, Mrs Beeton's sister Mrs Henrietta Mary Pourtois English advised her that [...] "Cookery is a Science {{that is only}} learnt by Long Experience and years of study which of course you have not had. Therefore my <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> be compile a book from receipts from a Variety of the Best Books published on Cookery and Heaven knows {{there is a great}} variety for you to choose from." [...] The recipes were largely copied from the most successful cookery books of the day, the copying in some cases acknowledged in the text. The [...] "variety" [...] included Eliza Acton's Modern Cookery for Private Families and her The English Bread–Book, Elizabeth Raffald's The Experienced English Housekeeper, Marie-Antoine Carême's Le Pâtissier royal parisien, Louis Eustache Ude's The French Cook, Alexis Soyer's The Modern Housewife or, Ménagère and The Pantropheon, Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy, Maria Eliza Rundell's A New System of Domestic Cookery, and the works of Charles Elmé Francatelli.|$|E
500|$|The Court of Appeal {{considers}} incitement {{to consist}} of {{a situation in which}} a defendant [...] "incites another to do or cause to be done an act or acts which, if done, will involve the commission of the offence or offences by the other; and he intends or believes that the other, if he acts as incited, shall or will do so with the fault required for the offence or offences". Unlike attempts, incitement is a common law offence. Incitement has a particularly broad actus reus; it has been interpreted to include [...] "a suggestion, proposal, request, exhortation, gesture, argument, persuasion, inducement, goading or the arousal of cupidity". While it must include an act of incitement, this can be both express and implied. For an offence to be committed, the incited act must be criminal in nature, and an offence not only for the person doing the incitement but the person incited. Some exceptions are made; under section 5(7) of the Criminal Law Act 1977, incitement to conspire is not an offence, and incitement to an aid or attempt are similarly not specifically given as criminal acts. In terms of mens rea, the defendant must have intended the incited offence to be committed, and also be aware of the likely consequences. It has been suggested that intent should not be necessary; if the defendant knew that his <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> be followed, and this would result in a crime, he should be found guilty.|$|E

500|$|While {{coping with}} the loss of her child, Isabella {{continued}} to work at The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine. Although she was not a regular cook, she and Samuel obtained recipes from other sources. A request to receive the readers' own recipes led to over 2,000 being sent in, which were selected and edited by the Beetons. Published works were also copied, largely unattributed to any of the sources. These included Eliza Acton's Modern Cookery for Private Families, Elizabeth Raffald's The Experienced English Housekeeper, Marie-Antoine Carême's Le Pâtissier royal parisien, Louis Eustache Ude's The French Cook, Alexis Soyer's The Modern Housewife or, Ménagère and The Pantropheon, Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy, Maria Eliza Rundell's A New System of Domestic Cookery, and the works of Charles Elmé Francatelli. Suzanne Daly and Ross G. Forman, in their examination of Victorian cooking culture, consider that the plagiarism makes it [...] "an important index of mid-Victorian and middle-class society" [...] because the production of the text from its own readers ensures that it is a reflection of what was actually being cooked and eaten at the time. In copying the recipes of others, Isabella was following the recommendation given to her by Henrietta English, a family friend, who wrote that [...] "Cookery is a Science that is only learnt by Long Experience and years of study which of course you have not had. Therefore my <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> be compile a book from receipts from a Variety of the Best Books published on Cookery and Heaven knows there is a great variety for you to choose from." ...|$|E
2500|$|When the Grants {{arrived at}} Athens they {{were greeted by}} King George I of Greece, who came aboard the Vandalia and spent the {{afternoon}} with Grant. The king sought Grant's advice concerning Greece's relations with Turkey and Grant found himself acting in a diplomatic capacity, knowing his <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> be received {{as a form of}} American interest. During their week-long visit in Athens, Grant scaled the Acropolis accompanied by Young, who noted that Grant appreciated [...] "the greatness of the past" [...] and was tireless during his walk through the ancient city.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2005, in {{the light}} of Penrose's findings, Equitable started a £2 billion High Court action against {{auditors}} [...] Ernst & Young, reduced 3 months later to £0.7 billion, claiming they had failed to inform the directors of the seriousness of its position. However lawyers advised they could not prove that correct <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> have changed the outcome, and the case was dropped in September. Ernst & Young described the case as [...] "ill conceived". Simultaneously, Equitable started a £3.3 billion claim against former directors, claiming that they failed in their duties to policyholders. This claim was abandoned in December 2005; the costs of the two cases amounted to around £40m.|$|E

6000|$|... "You're {{sometimes}} puzzled?" [...] Bernard suggested. [...] "Well, {{we are all}} puzzled now and then, {{and perhaps}} to trust your instincts is a good plan. This, however, is not <b>advice</b> I <b>would</b> give to everybody." ...|$|R
2500|$|It {{must also}} be noted that giving such <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> have been difficult. Garter King {{is a member of the}} Household of the Queen of the United Kingdom. The Canadian Heraldic Authority is a {{creation}} of the Queen of Canada and Her Government in Ottawa. Moreover, there was a political hurdle created in 1964. John Ross Matheson reports on page 121-2 of his book Canada's Flag (1980; [...] ) [...] the situation in 1964 of a committee of the Canadian Parliament detailed to consider the task of developing a Canadian flag. The committee was asking if Dr. Conrad Swan, then Rouge Dragon Pursuivant (and a Canadian who was planning to be in Ottawa on other business), might be able to appear before the committee. Matheson writes [...] "I did not see the final wording of our request but I have wondered since whether it may have been indelicately worded. ... To the considerable consternation of our committee, a curt reply was received by cable from Sir Anthony Wagner on Monday, 5 October denying permission to Rouge Dragon to appear. Garter stated that he alone would appear for the college. The shocked reaction of the committee when this communication was studied destroyed utterly the influence in Canada of this historic heraldic authority." ...|$|E

"Most {{women know}} by {{instinct}} {{whether they can}} give it or not," [...] Lady Otway slipped in quickly, in rather a low voice, {{as if she wanted}} to get this said while her sister-in-law's attention was diverted.

60|$|There {{could be}} no doubt at all as {{to the nature of}} Adela's advice; but Caroline had had no {{conception}} of the impetuosity of matured conviction on the subject, of the impassioned eloquence with which that <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> be given.
