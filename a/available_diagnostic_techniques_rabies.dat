40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS:Anti-cancer {{treatments}} markedly {{improved the}} prognosis of patients, but unfortunately might be hampered by cardiotoxicity. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic clinical forms of heart failure have been reported, which may be reversible or irreversible. The aim of this review is to {{provide an overview of}} the antineoplastic agents associated with cardiac toxicity and of the <b>available</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques.</b> METHODS AND METHODS: This narrative review is based on material from MEDLINE and PUBMED up to November 2015. We looked at the terms antineoplastic drugs and cardiac toxicity in combination with echocardiography, troponins, cardiac magnetic resonance, and positron emission tomography. RESULTS: Anthracyclines, monoclonal antibodies, fluoropyrimidines, taxanes, alkylating agents, vinka alkaloids were reported to induce different clinical manifestations of cardioxicity. Chest radiotherapy is also associated with various forms of cardiac damage, which are indistinguishable from those found in patients with heart disease of other etiologies and that may even appear several years after administration. Among <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques,</b> echocardiography is a non-invasive, cost-effective, and widely available imaging tool. Nuclear imaging and cardiac magnetic resonance may be used but are not so widely available and are more difficult to perform. Finally, some biomarkers, such as troponins, may be used to evaluate cardiac damage, but establishing the optimal timing of troponin assessment remains unclear and defining the cut-off point for positivity is still an important goal. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiotoxicity of anti-cancer treatments is associated with development of heart failure.

While pancreatic cysts are detected with an increasing frequency due {{to the use of}} advanced imaging modalities in clinical practice, the diagnosis of pancreatic cystic neoplasms remains unsatisfactory because <b>available</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques</b> proved not sensitive enough so far. This study was designed to characterize the proteomic pattern of pancreatic cyst fluids obtained from various cystic lesions. Cyst fluids were collected by direct puncture during open surgery to avoid any possible contamination from other tissues. CEA, CA- 19 - 9 and amylase concentrations were measured using specific immunoassays. After immunodepletion and fractionation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were digested and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Specific histological lesions were found to be associated with distinct protein patterns. Interestingly, some of these proteins have been proposed as biomarkers of pancreatic cancer. Immunoblots allowed verifying the differential expression in specific cyst fluids of two selected proteins, olfactomedin- 4 and mucin- 18. Finally, immunohistochemistry was performed to correlate these data with the expression pattern of olfactomedin- 4 and mucin- 18 in pancreatic cyst tissues. Results from this study indicate that proteomic analysis of cyst fluid could provide reliable candidates for developing new biomarkers for the preoperative management of malignant and premalignant pancreatic cysts...|$|R

Newly <b>available</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques</b> like sensitive antigen and antibody assays, Doppler ultrasonography and lymphoscintigraphy have helped to understand the subclinical pathology caused by this infection, which was hitherto generally believed to be irreversible. Recent studies indicate that drugs used in the mass drug administration (MDA) programme under GPELF are capable of reversing the sub-clinical lymphatic damage in children and provide benefits other than interruption of transmission. Albendazole and ivermectin used in MDA are effective against soil-transmitted helminthic infections common in children in LF endemic areas. Thus MDA had other 'beyond LF' benefits in treated children including increased appetite, weight gain, greater learning ability and concentration, better school attendance and prevention of anaemia. MDA should no longer {{be viewed as a}} measure for interrupting transmission alone. Recent findings of reversibility of early lymphatic pathology in treated children indicate that both MDA and 'foot-hygiene' measures are effective strategies in preventing and managing morbidity.

40|$|Clinical {{laboratories}} {{are increasingly}} receiving requests to perform nucleic acid amplification tests {{for the detection}} {{of a wide variety of}} infectious agents. In this paper, the efficiency of nucleic acid amplification techniques for the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections is reviewed. In general, these techniques should be applied only {{for the detection of}} microorganisms for which <b>available</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques</b> are markedly insensitive or nonexistent or when turnaround times for existing tests (e. g., viral culture) are much longer than those expected with amplification. This is the case for rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and hantaviruses causing a pulmonary syndrome, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Coxiella burnetii. For Legionella spp. and fungi, contamination originating from the environment is a limiting factor in interpretation of results, as is the difficulty in differentiating colonization and infection. Detection of these agents in urine or blood by amplification techniques remains to be evaluated. In the clinical setting, there is no need for molecular diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii. At present, amplification methods for Mycobacterium tuberculosis cannot replace the classical <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques,</b> due to their lack of sensitivity and the absence of specific internal controls for the detection of inhibitors of the reaction. Also, the results of interlaboratory comparisons are unsatisfactory. Furthermore, isolates are needed for susceptibility studies. Additional work remains to be done on sample preparation methods, comparison between different amplification methods, and analysis of results. The techniques can be useful for the rapid identification of M. tuberculosis in particular circumstances, as well as the rapid detection of most rifampin-resistant isolates.

40|$|Objective: Seronegative spondyloarthritis (SpA) is {{characterized}} by chronic inflammation affecting the axial skeleton, entheses and occasionally peripheral joints. The involvement of the sacroiliac joints, sacroiliitis, is considered as a pathognomonic radiographic finding. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the method of choice for its early detection. Bone scintigraphy (BS) {{is characterized}} by high sensitivity in the diagnosis of bone and articular diseases. Limited value of BS in the diagnosis of sacroiliitis {{may be attributed to}} the use of planar imaging. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of SPECT in SpA, compared to MRI. Methods: Forty-three patients suffering from inflammatory back pain underwent MRI evaluation of the sacroiliac joints and BS, combined with SPECT in the same region, for the assessment of sacroiliitis. Results: Bone SPECT revealed no findings of sacroiliitis in 11 patients, with total agreement with MRI. Findings of chronic lesions were demonstrated from both modalities in 2 patients. Bone SPECT and MRI findings were in concordance regarding the investigation of active sacroiliitis, {{with the exception of one}} patient with mild SPECT findings and negative MRI examination; the diagnosis of AS however, was established one year later, after a positive follow-up MRI. The evaluation of the planar imaging of the whole skeleton and SPECT imaging, revealed additional lesions. Conclusion: Bone SPECT is a reliable imaging method in the diagnosis of active sacroiliitis.

It {{was hypothesized that}} a mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach could identify urinary biomarkers of falciparum malaria. METHODS: The study used a case-control design, with cases consisting of 21 adults in central Ethiopia with a diagnosis of P. falciparum infection confirmed with microscopy, and 25 controls of adults with negative blood smears for malaria matched on age and sex. Urinary samples were collected from these individuals during presentation at the clinic, and a second sample was collected from both cases and controls 4 weeks later, after the cases had received anti-malarial medication. The urine samples were screened for small molecule urinary biomarkers, using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analyses followed by multivariate analysis using principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis. The chemical identity of statistically significant malaria biomarkers was confirmed using tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The urinary metabolic profiles of cases with P. falciparum infection were distinct from healthy controls. After treatment with anti-malarial medication, the metabolomic profile of cases resembled that of healthy controls. Significantly altered levels of 29 urinary metabolites were found. Elevated levels of urinary pipecolic acid, taurine, N-acetylspermidine, N-acetylputrescine and 1, 3 -diacetylpropane were identified as potential biomarkers of falciparum malaria.

We show that MUL_ 3720 is highly expressed by M. ulcerans and has no orthologs in other prevalent pathogenic mycobacteria. We generated a panel of anti-MUL_ 3720 antibodies and used them to confirm a cell wall location for MUL_ 3720. These antibodies could also specifically detect M. ulcerans in infected human tissue samples as well as in lysates of infected mouse footpads. A bacterial 2 -hybrid screen suggested a potential role for MUL_ 3720 in cell wall biosynthesis pathways.

40|$|Introduction The {{number of}} autoptic {{controls}} is progressively dropping worldwide {{during the last}} decades. Several social, cultural and normative causes may underlie this phenomenon. However, a hidden cause may be represented by the scepticism of physicians about the gain in information given by this practice. There {{is in fact a}} general thinking that <b>available</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques</b> may be adequate for a correct diagnosis, even {{in the case of a}} mortal outcome. Nevertheless, several studies have shown quite relevant discrepancies between premortem and postmortem diagnosis. In this study, the authors evaluate the accuracy of clinical diagnosis in diseases leading the patient to death. Materials and methods Retrospective analysis including all patients died in the Department of Internal Medicine of a General Hospital in Rome during a three year time period (1 st January 2007 – 31 December 2009). Age, sex, period of hospitalization, clinical diagnosis, autoptic diagnosis, cause of death, and level of discrepancy between clinical diagnosis and autoptic control have been collected. Main diagnoses have been classified as follows: (1) discrepancy with a possible influence on survival; (2) discrepancy with no or questionable influence on survival. Results Ninety-two cases (42 males, 50 females; mean age 79. 3 years) have been included. Thirty-four main diagnoses (36. 9 %) have been classified as discrepant (15. 2 % classified as type 1 discrepancy and 21. 7 as type 2).

40|$|Although {{progress}} has been made to reduce global incidence of drug-susceptible tuberculosis, the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis during the past decade threatens to undermine these advances. However, countries are responding far too slowly. Of the estimated 440 000 cases of MDR tuberculosis that occurred in 2008, only 7 % were identified and reported to WHO. Of these cases, only a fifth were treated according to WHO standards. Although treatment of MDR and XDR tuberculosis is possible with currently <b>available</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques</b> and drugs, the treatment course is substantially more costly and laborious than for drug-susceptible tuberculosis, with higher rates of treatment failure and mortality. Nonetheless, a few countries provide examples of how existing technologies can be used to reverse the epidemic of MDR tuberculosis within a decade. Major improvements in laboratory capacity, infection control, performance of tuberculosis control programmes, and treatment regimens for both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant disease will be needed, together with a massive scale-up in diagnosis and treatment of MDR and XDR tuberculosis to prevent drug-resistant strains from becoming the dominant form of tuberculosis. New diagnostic tests and drugs are likely to become available during the next few years and should accelerate control of MDR and XDR tuberculosis. Equally important, especially in the highest-burden countries of India, China, and Russia, will be a commitment to tuberculosis control including improvements in national policies and health systems that remove financial barriers to treatment, encourage rational drug use, and create the infrastructure necessary to manage MDR tuberculosis on a national scale. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|For both general {{practitioners}} and researchers in caries diagnostics, the true validity of <b>available</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques</b> is of considerable interest. Yet, for both bitewing radiography and fiber-optic transillumination, {{this is still}} not accurately known, nor is it clear {{which of the two}} techniques performs best clinically. This study's purpose was to estimate the clinical performance of the two techniques in diagnosing approximal caries lesions in low-caries-prevalence populations. Clinical studies that compare the two techniques were selected from literature. We determined 2 x 2 contingency tables from these studies and calculated one overall contingency table. The cut-off for decay was at dentinal caries. Assuming that erroneous outcomes from both techniques are mutually independent, we expressed diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the two techniques as functions of the contingency table cell contents, with caries prevalence as the parameter. Because the caries prevalence was unknown, every sensitivity and specificity value was possible. From the conditions that sensitivity, specificity, and caries prevalence are always between one and zero, a limited range of sensitivity and specificity values was obtained. Three situations were examined: Bitewing radiography specificity is 1, fiber-optic transillumination specificity is 1, and both specificities are equal. Under these conditions, the bitewing radiography sensitivity was between 1. 00 and 0. 71 +/- 0. 01, and the fiber-optic transillumination sensitivity was between 0. 70 +/- 0. 01 and 0. 50 +/- 0. 02. Both specificities were between 1. 00 and 0. 99. We concluded that the two techniques have comparable specificities, but that the fiber-optic transillumination sensitivity is significantly lower than that for bitewing radiography...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, {{diagnosis}} {{and management of}} small-bowel tumors were delayed by the difficulty {{of access to the}} small bowel and the poor diagnostic capabilities of the <b>available</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques.</b> An array of new methods has recently been developed, increasing the possibility of detecting these tumors at an earlier stage. Capsule endoscopy (CE) appears to be an ideal tool to recognize the presence of neoplastic lesions along this organ, since it is non-invasive and enables the entire small bowel to be visualized. High-quality images of the small-bowel mucosa may be captured and small and flat lesions recognized, without exposure to radiation. Recent studies on a large population of patients undergoing CE have reported small-bowel tumor frequency only slightly above that reported in previous surgical series (range, 1. 6 %- 2. 4 %) and have also confirmed that the main clinical indication to CE in patients with small-bowel tumors is obscure gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The majority of tumors identified by CE are malignant; many were unsuspected and not found by other methods. However, it remains difficult to identify pathology and tumor type based on the lesion’s endoscopic appearance. Despite its limitations, CE provides crucial information leading in most cases to changes in subsequent patient management. Whether the use of CE in combination with other new diagnostic (MRI or multidetector CT enterography) and therapeutic (Push-and-pull enteroscopy) techniques will lead to earlier {{diagnosis and}} treatment of these neoplasms, ultimately resulting in a survival advantage and in cost savings, remains to be determined through carefully-designed studies...|$|R
40|$|Background The Philippines has a {{population}} of approximately 103 million people, of which 6. 7 million live in schistosomiasis-endemic areas with 1. 8 million people being at risk of infection with Schistosoma japonicum. Although the country-wide prevalence of schistosomiasis japonica in the Philippines is relatively low, the prevalence of schistosomiasis can be high, approach-ing 65 % in some endemic areas. Of the currently <b>available</b> microscopy-based <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques</b> for detecting schistosome infections in the Philippines and elsewhere, most exhibit varying diagnostic performances, with the Kato-Katz (KK) method having particu-larly poor sensitivity for detecting low intensity infections. This suggests that the actual prevalence of schistosomiasis japonica may be much higher than previous reports have indicated. Methodology/Principal Findings Six barangay (villages) were selected to determine the prevalence of S. japonicum in hu-mans in the municipality of Palapag, Northern Samar. Fecal samples were collected fro...|$|R
40|$|Mast cell {{tumors are}} the most common {{cutaneous}} tumors recognized in dogs. However, numerous studies of mast cell disease have conflicting results which make disease characterization and determination of prognosis problematic. These conflicting results translate into variability in clinical staging, treatment, and use of adjunctive therapy. Historically, histologic grade has been {{considered one of the most}} valuable factors, if not the gold standard, in determining prognosis for mast cell tumors. The most commonly utilized histologic grading scheme was introduced by Patnaik et al. Cytologic evaluation of cutaneous tumors is relatively inexpensive, requires no specialized equipment, and results are rapidly <b>available.</b> These <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques</b> are minimally invasive and associated with little to no patient morbidity, in contrast to more aggressive procedures, such as surgical excision. The aim of the present study was to identify cytologic criteria of mast cell tumors that correlate to their histologic grade using the Patnaik scale...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{licensure}} and {{recommendation of}} varicella vaccine in the mid- 1990 s in the United States {{have led to}} dramatic declines in varicella incidence and varicella-related deaths and hospitalizations. Varicella outbreaks remain common and occur increasingly in highly vaccinated populations. Breakthrough varicella in vaccinated individuals is characteristically mild, typically with fewer lesions that frequently do not progress to a vesicular stage. As such, the laboratory diagnosis of varicella has grown increasingly important, particularly in outbreak settings. In this review the impact of varicella vaccine on varicella-zoster virus (VZV) disease, arising complications in the effective diagnosis and monitoring of VZV transmission, and the relative strengths and limitations of currently <b>available</b> laboratory <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques</b> are all addressed. Since disease symptoms often resolve in outbreak settings before suitable test specimens can be obtained, {{the need to develop}} new diagnostic approaches that rely on alternative patient samples is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Study design: Case report. Objective: To {{describe}} {{the difficulty in}} diagnosing spinal pseudomeningocoele. Setting: Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Case report: A case of progressive sacral swelling in a paraplegic man who sustained spinal cord injury 14 years ago is presented. Although his clinical features were suggestive of pseudomeningocoele, {{we were unable to}} confirm the diagnosis preoperatively. Conclusion: Traumatic spinal pseudomeningocoele is very rare. Even with the <b>available</b> modern <b>diagnostic</b> imaging <b>techniques,</b> it is still difficult to diagnose a spinal pseudomeningocoele...|$|R
