5|$|The Australian 2nd <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> was {{established}} on 21 February 1942 by redesignating and reorganising the 2nd Motor Division (which was previously the 2nd Cavalry Division). As an <b>armoured</b> <b>division,</b> {{it consisted of}} one armoured brigade of three armoured regiments, and one motor brigade consisting of three motor regiments, supported by an armoured car regiment. It was equipped with M3 Grant medium tanks and M3 Stuart light tanks. The 2nd <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> was disbanded in Queensland on 19 February 1943. Similarly, the Australian 3rd <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> {{was established}} on 15 November 1942 by redesignating the 1st Motor Division (which was previously the 1st Cavalry Division). As an <b>armoured</b> <b>division</b> the 3rd Armoured was equipped with M3 Grant medium tanks and M3 Stuart light tanks. The division's 3rd Motor Brigade was gradually disbanded between March to August 1943 and the 3rd <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> was disbanded in Queensland on 19 October 1943 {{as a result of}} manpower shortages in the Australian Army.|$|E
5|$|The 7th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> and the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division {{were the}} {{follow-up}} divisions of XXX Corps. The 22nd Armoured Brigade (the armoured {{component of the}} 7th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division)</b> was scheduled to land during the evening of 6 June, but it was unable to land until the next day. The bulk of the division landed from 9–10 June, with some elements landing later. The 49th Division came ashore on 12 June.|$|E
5|$|Between 11–13 April 1941, with German and Italian troops {{advancing}} on {{its rear}} areas, the Zetska Division {{was forced to}} retreat back to the Pronisat River by the Italian 131st <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> Centauro, where it remained {{until the end of}} the campaign on 16 April. The Italian <b>armoured</b> <b>division</b> along with the 18th Infantry Division Messina then advanced upon the Yugoslav fleet base of Kotor in Montenegro, also occupying Cettinje and Podgorica. The Yugoslavs lost 30,000 men captured in the Italian counterattacks.|$|E
50|$|Earlier units {{included}} the Conqueror tank (1955-1966) and FV4101 Charioteer (TA 1950s). Initially containing 3 <b>armoured</b> <b>divisions,</b> the BAOR was reformed by 1960 into 3 mixed divisions and additional brigade groups.

5|$|By 17 August the encirclement was incomplete. The 1st Polish <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division,</b> {{part of the}} First Canadian Army, {{was divided}} into three battlegroups and ordered to make a wide sweep to the {{south-east}} to meet American troops at Chambois. Trun fell to the 4th Canadian <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> on 18 August. Having captured Champeaux on 19 August, the Polish battlegroups converged on Chambois, and with reinforcements from the 4th Canadian <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division,</b> the Poles secured the town and linked up with the US 90th and French 2nd Armoured divisions by evening. The Allies were not yet astride the 7th Army escape route in any great strength, and their positions were attacked by German troops inside the pocket. An armoured column of the 2nd Panzer Division broke through the Canadians in St. Lambert, took half the village and kept a road open for six hours until nightfall. Many Germans escaped, and small parties made their way through to the Dives during the night.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Northcott was {{attached}} to the British 7th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> in the Middle East to study armoured warfare, returning to Australia in December 1941 to organise the new 1st <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division.</b> In March 1942, he assumed command II Corps. In September 1942, he was appointed Chief of the General Staff. As General Sir Thomas Blamey's principal non-operational subordinate, he was responsible for administering and training the wartime army. After the war, he served as commander of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in the post-war Occupation of Japan. He retired from the Army in 1946 to become the Governor of New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|From the northeast, the 2nd SS Panzer Division planned {{an assault}} in force against the four {{infantry}} battalions and two armoured regiments of the Polish 1st <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> dug in on Hill 262. The 9th SS Panzer Division would {{attack from the}} north, while simultaneously preventing Canadian units from reinforcing the Polish <b>armoured</b> <b>division.</b> Having managed {{to break out of}} the Falaise Pocket, the 10th SS, 12th SS and 116th Panzer Divisions would then attack Hill262 from the southwest. If this major obstacle could be cleared, German units could initiate a full withdrawal from the Falaise Pocket.|$|E

To force Panzer-Lehr to withdraw or surrender and to keep operations fluid, part of the 7th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> pushed through a gap in the German front line near Caumont and captured Villers-Bocage. The Battle of Villers-Bocage led to the vanguard of the 7th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> being ambushed and withdrawing from the town but by 17 June, Panzer Lehr had also been forced back and XXX Corps had taken Tilly-sur-Seulles.|$|E
5|$|SS General Kurt Meyer, {{commander}} of the 12th SS Panzer Division, had already ordered infantry from various formations shattered by the bombers and by the armoured attack, to occupy Cintheaux. He also moved forward two battlegroups from his division, consisting of assault guns, infantry and Tiger tanks, positioning them across the Canadian front. Shortly after midday, he ordered these two battlegroups to counter-attack the leading Allied troops. At this point, the Allied offensive plan called for additional bombardment by the Eighth Air Force, before the 4th Canadian <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> and the 1st Polish <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> pushed south towards Falaise {{on either side of}} the Caen–Falaise Road.|$|E

Shortly after, all light tanks were discarded from the establishments of British armoured divisions as not suitable for further service.|$|E
5|$|Turpitude was communicated through visual deceptions in Syria by {{all three}} armed forces. The RAF flew {{reconnaissance}} flights across the supposed targets, whilst the Navy set up major {{facilities in the}} Syrian coastal ports (anti-aircraft guns, search lights and other efforts that might hide major activity). Along the Turkish border the British Ninth Army (the small force protecting Syria), the 31st Indian <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> and 20th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> (a fictional division, really the dummy tanks of Jones' 24th Armoured Brigade) {{put on a show}} of readiness. Political deception, via Royal Flush, was also used to hint heavily at Allied actions in the region.|$|E
5|$|General General Bernard Montgomery (commanding {{the ground}} forces in Normandy), wanted {{an attack on}} the eastern flank of the front to capture Falaise, {{intending}} that such a move would precipitate a general German collapse. The First Canadian Army (Lieutenant General Harry Crerar), held this part of the Allied front. It consisted of the British I Corps, responsible for the extreme eastern flank of the Allied lines and II Canadian Corps (Lieutenant General Guy Simonds) south of Caen. The II Canadian Corps, which was to launch Operation Totalize consisted of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, 4th Canadian (<b>Armoured)</b> <b>Division,</b> 1st Polish <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division,</b> 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade and the British 33rd Armoured Brigade.|$|E

5|$|In early September 1940, the Italian 10th Army {{based in}} Libya {{conducted}} the Italian invasion of Egypt {{and three months}} later, the British and Commonwealth troops of the Western Desert Force began a counter-offensive, codenamed Operation Compass. In two months, the British advanced , occupying the Italian province of Cyrenaica and destroying the 10th Army. The advance was halted in February 1941 because of supply shortages and to give priority to the Battle of Greece. Renamed XIII Corps and reorganised under HQ Cyrenaica Command (CYRCOM), the troops of the former Western Desert Force adopted a defensive posture. Over the next few months, HQ Cyrenaica lost its commander, Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, followed by the 2nd New Zealand Division and the 6th Australian Division when they were sent to Greece in Operation Lustre. The 7th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division,</b> with virtually no serviceable tanks left, was also withdrawn {{and sent to the}} Nile Delta for rest and refitting. Wilson was replaced by Lieutenant-General Philip Neame; parts of the 2nd <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> and 9th Australian Division were deployed to Cyrenaica but both formations were inexperienced, ill-equipped {{and in the case of}} the 2nd <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division,</b> well under strength, after detachments to Greece.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} phase, Impetigo, the 43rd Division would move forward to relieve all Scottish {{infantry}} {{north of the}} Odon. The 15th Division would then assemble across the river and expand the bridgehead by capturing several important villages. In the final phase, codenamed Goitre, elements of the 43rd Division would cross the river to hold the area taken, while the 15th Division would continue to expand their bridgehead. The 11th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> would attempt to force a crossing over the River Orne and advance on their final objective of Bretteville-sur-Laize. The 4th Armoured Brigade, although attached to the 11th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division,</b> was restricted to operations between the Odon and Orne to protect the Corps flank and {{to be in a}} position to attack westwards or towards Caen, as necessary.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June, the 7th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> {{took over}} parts of 50th Northumbrian Division front with the 56th Infantry Brigade under command. By nightfall, the 7th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> {{had reached the}} {{north-western}} fringe of Tilly-sur-Seulles and next day penetrated the village capturing the central crossroads. The Panzer-Lehr Division made several counter-attacks, which forced the British out and attacks by the 50th (Northumbrian) Division bogged down in the bocage against the Panzer-Lehr Division. Army Group B planned to relieve the armoured divisions facing the Second Army from 11 June {{and replace them with}} infantry divisions, to concentrate the tanks in the Carentan area and avert the danger to Cherbourg. Adolf Hitler overruled Rommel and the next day ordered him not to retreat and instead roll up the Allied beachhead from east to west, starting with the Orne bridgehead.|$|E

25|$|Historian David French {{states that}} the Army's {{intention}} had been to create balanced all-arms formations; however, following the formation of their first <b>armoured</b> <b>divisions,</b> they had instead created tank-heavy divisions with too few infantry or supporting arms. He also notes that the reforms {{that took place in}} 1940 forfeited yet another opportunity to transform the tank-heavy <b>armoured</b> <b>divisions</b> into a balanced all-arms force.|$|R
5|$|Operation Spring was {{scheduled}} in four tightly timed phases. The Calgary Highlanders would attack Bourguébus Ridge and May-sur-Orne {{to secure the}} flanks of the main thrust, {{which was to be}} a move on Verrières Ridge by the Black Watch, along with armoured support from the British 7th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division</b> and the 4th Canadian (<b>Armoured)</b> <b>Division.</b> The plan called for the offensive to start on 23 July but poor weather led to a postponement for 48 hours. Taking advantage of this respite, the I SS Panzer Corps reinforced the ridge with an additional four battalions, 480 tanks and 500 guns. Allied Intelligence learned of this reinforcement through Ultra signals intercepts and advised Simonds's headquarters.|$|E

5|$|The Canadian II Corps—commanded by Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds—initially {{assigned}} two infantry {{divisions and}} one armoured brigade to {{the assault on}} the German positions around Verrières. The Canadian 3rd Infantry Division—having taken heavy casualties during the first six weeks of the Normandy campaign—was given a supporting role. The onus of the task therefore fell on the fresh, though relatively inexperienced, Canadian 2nd Infantry Division, along with the tanks of the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade. Additional forces were later made available in the shape of three divisions from the British I Corps: the 51st (Highland) Division, the Guards <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division,</b> and the British 7th <b>Armoured</b> <b>Division.</b> Despite having significantly more combat experience than their Canadian counterparts, the British units played a minor part in the battle.|$|E
50|$|In {{the wake}} of the Polish campaign, during the Phoney War French, British and German tank {{production}} sharply increased, with both western allies out-producing Germany. However, the Anglo-French coalition proved unable to match the Germans in the number of <b>armoured</b> <b>divisions,</b> as it was impossible to quickly raise such large units. Though the French possessed a superior number of tanks, often better armoured and armed, half of these were allotted at army-level to independent Bataillons de Chars de Combat ("battle tank battalions") for infantry support. In early 1940, the German command had concluded that it could not win a war of attrition and embarked on a high-risk strategy. They approved the Manstein Plan, envisaging an advance through the Ardennes by the main mass of German infantry divisions, spearheaded by seven <b>armoured</b> <b>divisions,</b> while the main mobile French reserve consisting of three Cavalry <b>armoured</b> <b>divisions</b> (Divisions Légères Mécaniques or Mechanised Light Divisions) — the only armoured units organised on the lines of the German <b>armoured</b> <b>divisions</b> — would be lured into the Low Countries by a feint attack with a lesser force, including three <b>armoured</b> <b>divisions.</b> In May 1940, during the Battle of France, the German feint resulted in a number of undecided armour engagements, among them the Battle of Hannut, the largest tank battle fought until that date. At the same time, German motorised infantry west of the Ardennes forced the crossings over the river Meuse, assisted by massive carpet bombing of the crossing points. In the original plan, the <b>armoured</b> <b>divisions</b> were again supposed to closely cooperate with the infantry divisions. In reality, armour commanders like Erwin Rommel and Heinz Guderian immediately broke out of the bridgeheads, initiating a drive towards the English Channel, which was reached within a week. The French reserve of four Infantry <b>armoured</b> <b>divisions,</b> the Divisions cuirassées, lacked sufficient strategic mobility to prevent this. The strategic envelopment surrounded the Belgian army, the British Expeditionary Force and the best French troops. It led to the Evacuation of Dunkirk and the ultimate fall of France in operation Fall Rot.|$|R
