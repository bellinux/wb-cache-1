5|$|Although Beebe {{continued}} to shoot animals {{when it was}} necessary for the purpose of examining them scientifically, he no longer regarded adding to a collection as a valid reason to take a life. In 1906 Beebe presented his own collection, which had grown to 990 specimens during his earlier years as <b>a</b> <b>collector,</b> as a gift to the zoo for educational and research purposes. For this gift he was made a life member of the New York Zoological Society. The same year, he was also elected a fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences.|$|E

5|$|Although {{his career}} as an artist was fleeting, Gibson's career as a patron and lover of art was lifelong. In the 1950s and 1960s Gibson made major {{contributions}} to the arts in Australia, both as <b>a</b> <b>collector</b> and a patron of arts organisations. He acquired the works of some of Australia's most highly regarded artists, such as Russell Drysdale, Albert Tucker and John Brack. Other artists well represented in his collection included Noel Counihan, John Passmore, Clifton Pugh and Clive Stephen.|$|E
5|$|Besides his {{governmental}} career, Gale was {{a member}} of the Society of Antiquaries and the Royal Society, where he served as treasurer. Gale was known as <b>a</b> <b>collector</b> of manuscripts and other antiquarian items, writing a few published works on those subjects. He donated his manuscript collection to his alma mater in 1738, and died in 1744. Although contemporaries felt he was one of the foremost scholars of his age, later historians have been less convinced, contrasting his learning unfavourably with his father's.|$|E
5|$|Conchology is the {{scientific}} study of mollusc shells, but the term conchologist is also sometimes used to describe <b>a</b> <b>collector</b> of shells. Many people pick up shells on the beach or purchase them and display them in their homes.

5|$|He was not {{an elegant}} exponent. His normal {{language}} is flat and monotonous. But uneven, and significantly so. For this author is erudite, a fancier of words, and <b>a</b> <b>collector.</b> Hence many rarities, or even inventions... first, when depicting the measures of a military disciplinarian, he brings in technical terms redolent of the camp. Second, archaism, preciosity, and flowery words.|$|E
5|$|In May 2005, Armstrong became {{involved}} in an unusual legal dispute with his barber of 20 years, Mark Sizemore. After cutting Armstrong's hair, Sizemore sold some of it to <b>a</b> <b>collector</b> for $3,000 without Armstrong's knowledge or permission. Armstrong threatened legal action against Sizemore unless he returned the hair or donated the proceeds to a charity of Armstrong's choosing. Sizemore, unable to retrieve the hair, decided to donate the proceeds to the charity of Armstrong's choice.|$|E

5|$|Nickel is an {{excellent}} alloying agent for certain precious metals and {{is used in the}} fire assay as <b>a</b> <b>collector</b> of platinum group elements (PGE). As such, nickel is capable of fully collecting all 6 PGE elements from ores, and of partially collecting gold. High-throughput nickel mines may also engage in PGE recovery (primarily platinum and palladium); examples are Norilsk in Russia and the Sudbury Basin in Canada.|$|E

5|$|William of Wrotham or William de Wrotham (died c. 1217) was {{a medieval}} English royal {{administrator}} and clergyman. Although a late 13th-century source says that William held a royal office under King Henry II of England (reigned 1154–1189), the first contemporary reference to William is in 1197, {{when he became}} responsible among other things for the royal tin mines. He also held ecclesiastical office, eventually becoming Archdeacon of Taunton, and served King John of England as an administrator of ecclesiastical lands and <b>a</b> <b>collector</b> of taxes.|$|E
5|$|In mid-December 1982 {{the author}} and future Holocaust denier David Irving was also {{involved}} in tracking the existence of diaries written by Hitler. Priesack had previously told Irving {{of the existence of}} one of the diaries with <b>a</b> <b>collector</b> in Stuttgart. In a visit to Priesack to assess his collection of Nazi documents, Irving found out Stiefel's phone number, from which he worked out the address; he also obtained photocopies of some of the diary pages from Priesack. Irving visited Stiefel unannounced and tried to find out the name of the source, but the collector misled him as to the origin. Irving examined Priesack's photocopies and saw a number of problems, including spelling mistakes and the change in writing style between certain words.|$|E

5|$|It passes into a {{primarily}} residential area, though several auto service shops exist {{along this}} stretch, {{as well as}} Northern Secondary School. The road heads slightly west south of Blythwood Road, then crosses Blythwood Ravine, which contains the small Burke Brook. After climbing into Lawrence Park, the road meets Lawrence Avenue East. This intersection, featuring a multi-stage traffic light, directs driver to the east before continuing north. From here to the northern terminus, it is classified as <b>a</b> <b>collector</b> road and is a wide residential street with several stop signs. The road ends {{near the edge of}} the West Don Valley at an intersection with Glen Echo Drive, adjacent to the Doncliffe Bus Loop.|$|E
5|$|Original Balabushka cues with {{verified}} provenance may realize tens {{of thousands}} of dollars at auction. In 1994, for example, a Balabushka was purchased by <b>a</b> <b>collector</b> for $45,000. In a 1998 Syracuse Herald-Journal article a collection of thirty original Balabushkas cues and six Gus Szamboti cues was estimated to be worth 2 million dollars, the cues said to be the equivalent in the cue collecting world of Rembrandts and van Goghs respectively. There are, however, many fake Balabushka cues in existence. Complicating matters, in the 1980s with the permission and license of his surviving family, a line of Balabushka replicas began to be manufactured in large quantities by the Adam Custom Cue Company.|$|E
5|$|The Second and Third of May 1808 {{are thought}} to have been {{intended}} as parts of a larger series. Written commentary and circumstantial evidence suggest that Goya painted four large canvases memorializing the rebellion of May 1808. In his memoirs of the Royal Academy in 1867, José Caveda wrote of four paintings by Goya of the second of May, and Cristóbal Ferriz—an artist and <b>a</b> <b>collector</b> of Goya—mentioned two other paintings on the theme: a revolt at the royal palace and a defense of artillery barracks. Contemporary prints stand as precedents for such a series. The disappearance of two paintings may indicate official displeasure with the depiction of popular insurrection.|$|E
