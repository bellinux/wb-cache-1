50|$|In the Willans engine, {{cushioning}} {{at the end}} {{of stroke}} was provided by an additional air cylinder below the others. The <b>air</b> <b>piston</b> also acted as a trunk guide. During the upward stroke, inertia of the engine continues its movement upwards and before the next stroke begins there is otherwise nothing to retard it. The enclosed air cylinder acts as a compressed air dashpot above the trunk guide piston.|$|E

50|$|The Michel {{engine was}} a {{two-stroke}} diesel engine, of piston-ported opposed-piston design. Its unusual feature was {{that rather than}} two pistons sharing a cylinder, the cylinders here were Y shaped and contained three pistons. The two upper pistons controlled the inlet ports, with the one lower piston controlling the exhaust ports. Having two inlet (scavenge <b>air)</b> <b>pistons</b> to one exhaust piston provided good scavenging and efficient combustion. The engine was water-cooled.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Air</b> <b>piston</b> was a {{short-lived}} variation of air pressure {{that was made}} in 2005 under the Aqua Master Pre-Charger lineup. [...] A tube with a piston in it was pressurized with air in the back, pushing the piston to the front. Then the gun was switched to water mode, and water would be pumped in the front, pushing the piston to the back again. This system gave the guns extra pressure, and allowed them to shoot any direction.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the beam}} engines, the main {{force of the}} piston is {{transmitted}} to the air cylinder by a purely reciprocating action and the flywheels are there merely to smooth {{the action of the}} engine. To permit adjustment though, the steam piston rod only goes as far as the crosshead and above this there are twinned rods to the <b>air</b> <b>piston.</b> The flywheel shaft is mounted below the steam piston, the paired connecting rods driving downwards and backwards to make this a return connecting rod engine.|$|E
5000|$|In late 2015 Vurtego's latest pogo stick, the V4, was introduced. The V4 was {{the first}} major {{redesign}} since the V1. The entire design of the V4 was centered around the new <b>Air</b> <b>Piston,</b> which combined the spacer and piston designs from the V1-V3 in order to increase air volume by 10%. This additional air volume creates a smoother, softer bounce that feels very similar to a trampoline. The V4 jumps higher with less effort than its predecessors. In order to reduce friction during the bounce a smaller o-ring seal and new bushing were implemented. A much harder, 90a urethane donut with sound dampening nubs was integrated into the design, and four additional breather holes were added to the cylinder in order to increase the air flow. The stroke was extended by 1" [...] on the V4 and 3" [...] on the V4 Pro, allowing for riders to jump higher without bottoming out the stroke. The last major update was a round Grip Tip, which provides the same amount of surface area no matter what angle a rider lands at. The V4 is offered in white, and the V4 Pro is offered in a bright green.|$|E

40|$|Abstract An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine and reduce the causes of variation between a 304 Stainless Steel and super elastic Nickel Titanium dissimilar metal weld. Six factors were established to understand the cause of variation: perpendicularity, final grind, surface finish, weld force, weld pulse duration, and alignment. Using a rotational test with an <b>air</b> <b>piston</b> break pressures were established and charted in Minitab to identify trends. It was shown that weld force and weld pulse duration were the two factors that had the most influence on break strength. This data also showed that higher strength groups had less variability. So strength had to be maximized. SEM, BSE, and EDS {{were used to determine}} material differences at the interface. There were three instances of possible intermetallic compounds that need to be examined further...|$|E

40|$|Flies {{and other}} insects use vision to {{regulate}} their groundspeed in flight, {{enabling them to}} fly in varying wind conditions. Compared with mechanosensory modalities, however, vision requires a long processing delay (~ 100 ms) that might introduce instability if operated at high gain. Flies also sense air motion with their antennae, but how this is used in flight control is unknown. We manipulated the antennal function of fruit flies by ablating their aristae, forcing them to rely on vision alone to regulate groundspeed. Arista-ablated flies in flight exhibited significantly greater groundspeed variability than intact flies. We then subjected them {{to a series of}} controlled impulsive wind gusts delivered by an <b>air</b> <b>piston</b> and experimentally manipulated antennae and visual feedback. The results show that an antenna-mediated response alters wing motion to cause flies to accelerate {{in the same direction as}} the gust. This response opposes flying into a headwind, but flies regularly fly upwind. To resolve this discrepancy, we obtained a dynamic model of the fly’s velocity regulator by fitting parameters of candidate models to our experimental data. The model suggests that the groundspeed variability of arista-ablated flies is the result of unstable feedback oscillations caused by the delay and high gain of visual feedback. The antenna response drives active damping with a shorter delay (~ 20 ms) to stabilize this regulator, in exchange for increasing the effect of rapid wind disturbances. This provides insight into flies’ multimodal sensory feedback architecture and constitutes a previously unknown role for the antennae...|$|E

A review of turbidity and laboratory analytical results for TCE, PCE, and chromium (Cr) from six wells highlight the affect or lack of affects the sampling systems have on groundwater samples. In the PVC wells, turbidity typically remained < 5 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) regardless of the sampling system. In the wells with a stainless steel screen, turbidity typically remained < 5 NTU only with the low-flow system. When the high-volume system was used, the turbidity and Cr concentration typically increased an order of magnitude. TCE concentrations at two wells {{did not appear to}} be sensitive to the sampling method used. However, PCE and TCE concentrations dropped an order of magnitude when the high-volume system was used at two other wells. This paper recommends that SNL/NM collaborate with other facilities with similar groundwater depths, continue to pursue regulatory approval for using dedicated the lowflow system, and review data for sample system affects on nitrate concentrations...|$|E

40|$|To achieve both {{accumulator}} pressure {{regulation and}} gen-erator power tracking for a Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) system, a nonlinear controller designed base on an en-ergy based Lyapunov function. The control inputs for the storage system are the pump/motor displacements inside the hydraulic transformer and the liquid <b>piston</b> <b>air</b> compressor/expander. While the pump/motor inside the liquid piston {{has a low}} band-width, the other pump/motor inside the hydraulic transformer has a relatively higher bandwidth. On the other hand, the pneu-matic energy storage path of open accumulator has high en-ergy density, whereas the hydraulic path is more power dense. The nonlinear controller is then modified based on these proper-ties. In the proposed approach, the control effort is distributed between the two pump/motors based on their bandwidths: Hy-draulic transformer reacts to high frequency events, while the liquid <b>piston</b> <b>air</b> compressor/expander perform a steady stor-age/regeneration task. As the result, liquid <b>piston</b> <b>air</b> compres-sor/expander will loosely maintain the accumulator pressure ra-tio, while the pump/motor in hydraulic transformer precisely tracks the desired generator power.
