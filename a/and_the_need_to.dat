He gave Navy and Marine Corps Medals for bravery to four officers and men who had successfully fought a fire in a rail car parked within a revetment near the pier.

5|$|As an {{offshoot}} of Boeing's MX-2145 manned boost-glide bomber project, Boeing partnered with RAND Corporation in January 1954 to explore what sort of bomber aircraft {{would be needed to}} deliver the various nuclear weapons then under development. At the time, nuclear weapons weighed several tons, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> carry enough fuel to fly that payload from the continental United States to the Soviet Union demanded large bombers. They also concluded that after release of bombs the aircraft would need supersonic speed to escape the critical blast-radius.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{scholars}} {{debate whether}} the Ming dynasty had sovereignty over Tibet. Some {{believe it was}} a relationship of loose suzerainty that was largely cut off when the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) persecuted Buddhism in favor of Daoism at court. Others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship.

5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts.

The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E

When Archbishop of Canterbury William Warham died, Anne's influence <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> find a trustworthy supporter of the annulment had Thomas Cranmer appointed to the vacant position.

5|$|Although the {{government}} of Bhutan goes {{to great lengths to}} prevent outside influences from intruding on Bhutanese culture, Drukair is not immune to problems which affect the airline industry and the world community at large. In June 2008, citing hikes in the price of oil <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> contain operational costs, the airline reduced frequencies across its network and announced an increase in airfares to offset the increased costs, whilst taking advantage of the lower cost of jet fuel at Delhi, Kolkata and Bangkok airports. Due to its small network which is reliant on fifth-freedom rights, Drukair regularly leases its aircraft to other airlines, such as Myanmar Airways International, Indian Airlines and Bangkok Airways in order to keep utilisation rates on its aircraft higher than they would under normal circumstances, whilst at the same time earning extra revenue.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak {{used to run}} its trains through Cleveland Union Terminal (now Tower City Center), {{which was}} built in 1928 and served as the main {{terminal}} for the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit, and in 1955, the crosstown Red Line. By 1976, because of Cleveland Union Terminal's high rent, the massive size of the facility, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> switch to electric locomotives to access its enclosed platforms, Amtrak decided to construct a smaller station. Lakefront Station was built in 1976–1977 and opened for service in 1977 to provide service for the Lake Shore Limited, which had resumed service via Toledo in 1975. The station officially opened on June 29, 1977, with the formal dedication occurring on July 12. According to Amtrak's employee magazine, a crowd of more than 300 gathered for {{the dedication of the}} $552,000 depot. Speakers included Mary J. Head, vice chairman of the Amtrak Board of Directors, and Cleveland Mayor Ralph J. Perk. Following the dedication ceremony, attendees were invited to tour the facility and enjoy cake and coffee.|$|E
5|$|As combat {{operations}} quickly revealed, {{the two sides}} were badly mismatched. FANK, whose ranks had been increased by thousands of young urban Cambodians who had flocked to join it {{in the months following}} the removal of Sihanouk, had expanded well beyond its capacity to absorb the new men. Later, given the press of tactical operations <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> replace combat casualties, there was insufficient time to impart needed skills to individuals or to units, and lack of training remained the bane of FANK's existence until its collapse.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{joined the}} Grand Fleet in a sortie on 29 March, in {{response}} to intelligence that the German fleet was leaving port as the precursor to a major operation. By the next night, the German ships had withdrawn, and Australia returned to Rosyth. On 11 April, the British fleet was again deployed on the intelligence that a German force was planning an operation. The Germans intended to lay mines at the Swarte Bank, but after a scouting Zeppelin located a British light cruiser squadron, they began to prepare for {{what they thought was}} a British attack. Heavy fog <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> refuel caused Australia and the British vessels to return to port on 17 August, and although they were redeployed that night, they were unable to stop two German light cruisers from laying the minefield. From 26 to 28 January 1916, the 2nd BCS was positioned off the Skagerrak while the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron swept the strait in an unsuccessful search of a possible minelayer.|$|E
