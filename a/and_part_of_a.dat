5|$|Howe {{was born}} in 1871 in Indianapolis, Indiana, to wealthy parents, Eliza and Edward P. Howe, who owned a store <b>and</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{wholesale}} business. Edward P. Howe, originally from Cincinnati, Ohio, had been a captain with the Union Army in the Civil War and made an unsuccessful run for the Indiana State Senate as a Democrat before Louis' birth. Louis had two stepsisters, Maria and Cora, from his mother's previous marriage. Howe was sickly and fragile as a child, suffered from asthma, and was generally kept home by his parents; he would never grow to more than five feet tall. Fearing to expose Howe to public school, his parents instead enrolled him in an all-girls seminary.|$|E

All the major styles of English medieval architecture, from Norman to Perpendicular, are represented in the present building.|$|E

Miller Huggins was the next manager to manage the team {{for more than three}} seasons. Huggins took over the managerial duties in 1918 and led the Yankees to six American League championships and three World Series titles until his death in 1929.

5|$|After the Canadiens were {{eliminated}} {{for the third}} straight year in the first playoff round during the spring of 1963, there was mounting pressure for change from their fans and media. Growing tension between Plante and Blake because of Plante's inconsistent work ethic and demeanor caused Blake to declare that for the 1963–64 season either he or Plante must go. On June 4, 1963, Plante was traded to the New York Rangers, with Phil Goyette and Don Marshall in exchange for Gump Worsley, Dave Balon, Leon Rochefort, and Len Ronson. Plante played for the Rangers for one full season <b>and</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second.

5|$|On 7 January 1983 amateur fossil hunter William J. Walker {{discovered}} a large claw, a phalanx bone, <b>and</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rib in Smokejacks Pit, a clay pit near Ockley in Surrey, England. The {{tip of the}} claw was missing, but Walker found it a week later. British palaeontologists Alan J. Charig and Angela C. Milner examined the finds at the Natural History Museum of London and found more bones at the site on 7 February, but the entire skeleton could not be collected until May and June due to conditions at the pit. A team of eight museum staff members and several volunteers excavated two tonnes of matrix. Walker donated the claw to the museum, and the Ockley Brick Company (owners of the pit) donated {{the rest of the}} skeleton and provided equipment. The area had been explored for 200 years, but no similar remains had been found before.|$|E
5|$|Six medieval coins were recovered, the {{earliest}} {{of which was}} a silver penny of John from the early 13thcentury.

Only low-denomination coins were found from the 18thcentury and later, including a 10-pfennig piece from Germany dated 1901. Two silver spoons were recovered, one of which was dated 1846 from the hallmark. Objects made from copper alloy were found, many of which were associated with personal adornment and dress including brooches, buckles, and buttons. Also found from this period was a small simple chape (scabbard tip), <b>and</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> skimmer that had been used in the kitchen. Artefacts made from iron, other than nails, were again mainly items of personal adornment and dress.

5|$|The NSDAP was a far-right {{political}} party which came {{into its own}} during the social and financial upheavals that occurred {{with the onset of}} the Great Depression in 1929. While in prison after the failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, Hitler wrote Mein Kampf, which laid out his plan for transforming German society into one based on race. The ideology of Nazism brought together elements of antisemitism, racial hygiene and eugenics and combined them with pan-Germanism and territorial expansionism with the goal of obtaining more Lebensraum for the Germanic people. The regime attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or kill the Jews and Slavs living there, who were viewed as being inferior to the Aryan master race <b>and</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Jewish Bolshevik conspiracy. The Nazi regime believed that only Germany could defeat the forces of Bolshevism and save humanity from world domination by International Jewry. Others deemed life unworthy of life by the Nazis included the mentally and physically disabled, Romani people, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses and social misfits.|$|E
