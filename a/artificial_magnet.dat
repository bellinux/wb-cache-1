60|$|The {{assertion}} of Bernoulli and others, that the absolute {{force of the}} <b>artificial</b> <b>magnet</b> increases in the ratio of its superficies, stands corrected in the far more accurate experiments of Coulomb (published in his Treatise on Magnetism), which proves that the increase takes place (in a far greater degree) in the ratio of its length. The same naturalist even found means to determine that the directing powers of the needle, which he had measured by help of his balance de tortion, stand {{to the length of}} the needle in such a ratio as that, provided only the length of the needle is from forty to fifty times its diameter, the momenta of these directing powers will increase in the very same direct proportion as the length is increased. Nor is this all that may be deduced from the experiment last mentioned. If only the magnet be strong enough, it will show likewise that magnetism seeks the length. The proof is contained in the remarkable fact, that the iron interposed between the magnet and the magnetic needle breadthways constantly acquires its two opposite poles at both ends lengthways. Though the preceding experiments are abundantly sufficient to prove the position, yet the following deserves mention for the beautiful clearness of its evidence. If the magnetic power is determined exclusively by length, it is to be expected that it will manifest no force, where the piece of iron is of such a shape that no one dimension predominates. Bring a cube of iron near the magnetic needle and it will not exert the slightest degree of power beyond what belongs to it as mere iron. By the perfect equality of the dimensions, the magnetism of the earth appears, as it were, perplexed and doubtful. Now, then attach a second cube of iron to the first, and the instantaneous act of the iron on the magnetic needle will make it manifest that with the length thus given, the magnetic influence is given at the same moment.|$|E

By examining several different setups, we show analytically that the {{angular momentum}} of the topological modes exhibits a highly chiral behavior, and can be coupled to spin and/or valley degrees of freedom, reflecting {{the nature of the}} interface states. The energies and the magnetic moments corresponding to these states can be understood from a semiclassical picture. These loops can be viewed as building blocks for <b>artificial</b> <b>magnets</b> with tunable and highly diverse properties...|$|R

40|$|We {{report an}} <b>artificial</b> geometrically {{frustrated}} <b>magnet</b> {{based on an}} array of lithographically fabricated single-domain ferromagnetic islands. The islands are arranged such that the dipole interactions create a two-dimensional analogue to spin ice. Images of the magnetic moments of individual elements in this correlated system allow us to study the local accommodation of frustration. We see both ice-like short-range correlations and an absence of long-range correlations, behaviour which is strikingly similar to the lowtemperature state of spin ice. These results demonstrate that <b>artificial</b> frustrated <b>magnets</b> can provide an uncharted arena in which the physics of frustration can be directly visualized.

By varying the island-island distance along one direction, {{we are able to}} tune the ratio of different interactions between neighboring islands, resulting in a corresponding variation in the local correlations between the island moments. Unlike other <b>artificial</b> frustrated <b>magnets,</b> this lattice geometry displays regions of ordered moment orientation, possibly resulting from a higher degree of anisotropy leading to a reduced level of frustration...|$|R
50|$|With {{the help}} of {{lithography}} techniques, {{it is possible to}} fabricate sub-micrometer size magnetic islands whose geometric arrangement reproduces the frustration found in naturally occurring spin ice materials. Recently R. F. Wang et al. reported the discovery of an <b>artificial</b> geometrically frustrated <b>magnet</b> composed of arrays of lithographically fabricated single-domain ferromagnetic islands. These islands are manually arranged to create a two-dimensional analog to spin ice. The magnetic moments of the ordered ‘spin’ islands were imaged with magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and then the local accommodation of frustration was thoroughly studied. In their previous work on a square lattice of frustrated magnets, they observed both ice-like short-range correlations and the absence of long-range correlations, just like in the spin ice at low temperature. These results solidify the uncharted ground on which the real physics of frustration can be visualized and modeled by these <b>artificial</b> geometrically frustrated <b>magnets,</b> and inspires further research activity.|$|R
5000|$|Johann Michael Ekling was the posthumous son of {{the army}} surgeon Joseph Ekling. His mother was Anna Maria Eurosina Ekling, née Stitzbarth. He {{was born in the}} suburb of Matzleinsdorf in Vienna. At the age of 33 he married Theresia Schwarz with whom he had five sons and a daughter. In the years to follow he cooperated closely with {{mathematics}} and physics professors Andreas von Baumgartner (German Wikipedia) and Andreas von Ettingshausen of the University of Vienna. He produced <b>artificial</b> <b>magnets</b> on behalf of Baumgartner {{and one of the first}} photographic apparatuses in Austria (1839) following instructions by Ettingshausen, who had worked with Daguerre. By 1844 he is referred to as a [...] "university mechanic". An announcement in a paper describes his range of products as follows: [...] "Ekling makes all sorts mathematical and physical instruments and apparatuses, air pumps with glass barrel chambers, travel barometers, goniometers, chemical and mineralogical apparatuses". His multiplicator was used for the analysis of mineral waters among other things and praised for its sensitivity. Ekling was granted patents for induction machines, cameras and improvements to the Bain telegraph, which were taken over by the Austrian railway. Ekling’s last invention was a [...] "Galvanic Induction Machine for Medical Purposes".His reputation as a mechanic is documented in the Austrian Law Gazette for 1850: [...] "The most recommendable mechanic in Vienna, and as regards more sophisticated optical equipment, the only one to be recommended, is Eckling." [...] Among these instruments we find the heliostat in the picture alongside. Young mechanics from Germany like Rudolph Carl Adolph Dolberg (1817-1863) and Adolph Hermann Friedrich Petri (1819-1895) were apprenticed to Ekling. Johann Leopolder, who later ran his own large Telegraph and Telephone Company was also one of his apprentices and later his foreman, until he started his own establishment in 1850.In 1860 Ekling sold his premises at 25 Erdbergstrasse to his neighbour Rudolf Ditmar who owned a rapidly expanding kerosine lamp factory. He died a gentleman of independent means at Landstrasse/Vienna in 1876.|$|R

Mn-hole exchange anisotropy is shown to lead to profound consequences on noise, like super-Poissonian behaviour. We report on a novel effect, similar to the Dicke effect in Quantum Optics, that allows to separately extract the hole and Mn spin relaxation times using frequency-resolved shot noise measurements. We expect that our findings may have further relevance to experiments in other S> 1 / 2 systems including transport through Mn(12) molecules and STM spectroscopy of magnetic atoms...|$|R

Gilbert, a physician, in his Latin treatise on the magnet, not only collected all the knowledge which others had possessed on that subject, but became at once the father of experimental philosophy in this island, and by a singular felicity and acuteness of genius, the founder of theories which have been revived after the lapse of ages, and are almost universally received into the creed of the science. The magnetism of the earth itself, his own original hypothesis, nova illa nostra et inaudita de tellure sententia new and unprecedented view of the planet... was by no means one of those vague conjectures that are sometimes unduly applauded... He relied on the analogy of terrestrial phenomena to those exhibited by what he calls a terrella, or <b>artificial</b> spherical <b>magnet.</b> ...Gilbert was also one of our earliest Copernicans, at least as to the rotation of the earth; and with his usual sagacity inferred, before the invention of the telescope, that there are a multitude of fixed stars beyond the reach of our vision.|$|R
