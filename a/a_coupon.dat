5|$|On 11 January 2010, {{shortly before}} an {{announcement}} that Red Football's debt had increased to £716.5million ($1.17billion), Manchester United announced {{their intention to}} refinance the debt through a bond issue worth approximately £500million. They managed to raise £504million in just under two weeks, meaning {{that they were able}} to pay off almost all of the £509million owed to international banks. The bonds were issued in two tranches, one with <b>a</b> <b>coupon</b> rate of 8.75% worth £250million, and the other with <b>a</b> <b>coupon</b> rate of 8.375% worth $425million. The annual interest payable on the bond came to approximately £45million per annum, with the bond due to mature on 1 February 2017. Contained within the bond prospectus were covenants that would allow the Glazers to filter large sums of money out of the club to repay the PIKs by 2015. These include the carving out of £95million in cash, the sale and lease-back of the Trafford Training Centre at Carrington, and the ability of the Glazers to pay themselves 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the club every year.|$|E

5|$|Cooke {{was a more}} {{hands-on}} owner than Short, and overhauled the team's operations. He personally financed {{construction of}} the Forum in 1967 {{at a cost of}} $16.5million. He owned the team until 1979 when he sold it, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum, and some real estate to Jerry Buss for $67million. Cooke was forced to sell the team as he was undergoing a costly divorce. Buss was a local chemical engineer and former University of Southern California professor who had become wealthy in real estate. Philip Anschutz bought a stake in the team in 1998, and until October 2010 Magic Johnson was a minority owner as well. Buss started the trend of allowing sponsors to add their name to team's stadiums when he renamed the Forum the Great Western Forum in 1988. In 2009 major sponsors included Verizon Wireless, Toyota, Anheuser-Busch, American Express, and Carl's Jr., and the team's $113 average ticket price was the highest in the league. Fast food chain Jack in the Box is another major sponsor, the company gives all fans in attendance at home games <b>a</b> <b>coupon</b> for two free tacos if the Lakers hold their opponent under 100 points and win. The company also sponsors the team's halftime shows on KCAL-TV and Fox Sports West. In 2013, Buss {{died at the age of}} 80 after being hospitalized for 18 months with cancer. His controlling ownership of the team passed to his six children via a trust, with each child receiving an equal vote. Buss' succession plan had daughter Jeanie Buss assume his title as the Lakers' governor as well as its team representative at NBA Board of Governors meetings.|$|E

50|$|Similarly if a {{fixed rate}} CMO tranche coupon is desired to be increased, then {{principal}} {{can be removed}} to form a Principal Only (PO) class and a premium fixed rate tranche. A PO pays no coupon, but receives principal payments from amortization and prepayments. For example, a $100mm sequential (SEQ) tranche off 6% collateral with <b>a</b> 6% <b>coupon</b> ('6 off 6') can be cut into an $92.307692mm SEQ tranche with <b>a</b> 6.5% <b>coupon</b> (and hence <b>a</b> higher dollar price) called a '6.5 off 6', and a SEQ PO tranche with a principal of $7.692308mm and paying <b>a</b> no <b>coupon.</b> The principal of the premium SEQ is calculated as (6 / 6.5) * $100mm, {{the principal of the}} PO is calculated as balance from $100mm.|$|R
