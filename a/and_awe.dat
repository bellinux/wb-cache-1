5|$|Ivan ends {{his story}} {{deep in thought}} as Vasilisa begins to cry and Lukerya looks on in pain. He parts with the widows and {{continues}} homeward, thinking that his story troubled Lukerya and made Vasilisa weep not because he told it well but because the tale was relevant to them nineteen centuries later. As he rides the ferry to his village, Ivan comes to believe that truth and beauty serve as the connectors of all human history and he is filled with joy <b>and</b> <b>awe</b> at life itself.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} of the focus á with the demonstratives gives the frequently used particles áyá <b>and</b> <b>áwé,</b> and the less common áhé and áyú. Combination of the interrogative ágé with the demonstratives gives the confirmative particles ákwé and ákyá (ák-hé and ákyú are uncommon), used to elicit a yes/no response from the listener.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} when early artists {{designed}} to represent God the Father, fear <b>and</b> <b>awe</b> restrained {{them from a}} usage of the whole human figure. Typically {{only a small part}} would be used as the image, usually the hand, or sometimes the face, but rarely a whole human. In many images, the figure of the Son supplants the Father, so a smaller portion of the person of the Father is depicted.|$|E

25|$|Moore's law has {{affected}} the performance of other technologies significantly: Michael S. Malone wrote of a Moore's War following the apparent success of shock <b>and</b> <b>awe</b> {{in the early days}} of the Iraq War. Progress in the development of guided weapons depends on electronic technology. Improvements in circuit density and low-power operation associated with Moore's law also have contributed to the development of technologies including mobile telephones and 3-D printing.|$|E
25|$|The {{literary}} sublime, {{as well as}} the philosophical, aesthetic sublimes, {{is inherently}} connected to nature but, as with most literary terms, the sublime evolved alongside literature. More authors began to connect the natural sublime to an internalized emotion of terror. Authors began to see the sublime, with its inherent contradictions (pain and pleasure, terror <b>and</b> <b>awe)</b> as representative of the changing political and cultural climate of the times. They began to incorporate more aspects of the sublime into their literary works as a way of externalizing their inner conflicts. In this way, the sublime particularly appealed to the Romantics.|$|E
25|$|After reigning {{for some}} years, Olembetsitoto went into seclusion. His {{followers}} {{believed that he}} had become holy (faly) and made his land and people holy (maha-faly) through this act, which mirrored popular belief around the principal Maroserana deity Andriamaro, {{which could not be}} seen, communicated through a medium intermediary, and commanded obedience by inspiring fear <b>and</b> <b>awe.</b> The followers of this noble remained united in their allegiance to him through the ombiasy (holy adviser) who served as an intermediary between the ruler and his people. One of the earliest documented Mahafaly political actions was In June 1649, when twelve Mahafaly envoys visited the French settlement at Fort Dauphin to successfully obtain the paid services of French mercenaries to help fight the Masikoro people who had stolen their king's cattle.|$|E

25|$|Rabbi Ziemba {{also took}} {{an active role}} in the Agudas Yisroel at an early stage. At its first Knessia Gedola (great gathering), he was not yet forty when chosen to serve as honorary {{secretary}} in the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. At the second Knessia Gedola, Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzenski agreed to serve as chairman of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah only if Rabbi Ziemba would continue in his position, while the forty-five-year-old Rabbi Ziemba felt himself to be too young and sought to stay in the background. At the third Knessiah Gedolah in 1937 in Marienbad, Austria, which played witness to the last massive gathering of European Orthodoxy before the Holocaust, Rabbi Ziemba was at the height of his fame. He spoke twice to the full assemblage and each time was greeted with hushed silence <b>and</b> <b>awe.</b>|$|E
25|$|Socrates {{then returns}} to {{the myth of the}} chariot. The charioteer is filled with warmth and desire as he gazes into the eyes of the one he loves. The good horse is {{controlled}} by its sense of shame, but the bad horse, overcome with desire, does everything it can {{to go up to the}} boy and suggest to it the pleasures of sex. The bad horse eventually wears out its charioteer and partner, and drags them towards the boy; yet when the charioteer looks into the boy's face, his memory is carried back to the sight of the forms of beauty and self-control he had with the gods, and pulls back violently on the reins. As this occurs over and over, the bad horse eventually becomes obedient and finally dies of fright when seeing the boy's face, allowing the lover's soul to follow the boy in reverence <b>and</b> <b>awe.</b>|$|E
25|$|Before the invasion, many {{observers}} had expected a lengthy campaign of aerial bombing before any ground action, taking as examples the 1991 Persian Gulf War or the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. In practice, U.S. plans envisioned simultaneous air and ground assaults to decapitate the Iraqi forces quickly (see Shock <b>and</b> <b>awe),</b> attempting to bypass Iraqi military units and cities in most cases. The {{assumption was that}} superior mobility and coordination of Coalition forces {{would allow them to}} attack the heart of the Iraqi command structure and destroy it in a short time, and that this would minimize civilian deaths and damage to infrastructure. It was expected that the elimination of the leadership would lead to the collapse of the Iraqi Forces and the government, and that much of the population would support the invaders once the government had been weakened. Occupation of cities and attacks on peripheral military units were viewed as undesirable distractions.|$|E

500|$|Cameron {{acknowledges}} that Avatar implicitly criticizes the United States' {{role in the}} Iraq War and the impersonal nature of mechanized warfare in general. In reference {{to the use of}} the term shock <b>and</b> <b>awe</b> in the film, Cameron said, [...] "We know what it feels like to launch the missiles. We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America." [...] He said in later interviews, [...] "...I think it's very patriotic to question a system that needs to be corralled..." [...] and, [...] "The film is definitely not anti-American." ...|$|E
500|$|Snakes {{have been}} a motif in human culture and {{religion}} and an object of dread and fascination all over the world. The vivid patterns of snake scales, such as the Gaboon Viper, both repel and fascinate the human mind. Such patterns have inspired dread <b>and</b> <b>awe</b> in humans from pre-historic times and these {{can be seen in}} the art prevalent to those times. [...] Studies of fear imagery and psychological arousal indicate that snake scales are a vital component of snake imagery. Snake scales also appear to have affected Islamic art in the form of tessallated mosaic patterns which show great similarity to snake-scale patterns.|$|E

500|$|The {{performance}} of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] {{at the very}} first MTV Video Music Awards is considered by MTV as one of [...] "one of the most iconic pop performances of all time". Christina Garibaldi from the channel noted that the performance [...] "helped make the Video Music Awards a household name... and simultaneously set the bar for every other performer to come after her. From that point forward, every artist, {{when they hit the}} VMA stage, wanted to have a performance you would forever be talking about." [...] According to Joe Lynch from Billboard, the song's performance at the 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour [...] "opened the gates for everyone from Marilyn Manson to Miley Cyrus to shock <b>and</b> <b>awe</b> on stage in the decades to come." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} {{was met with}} polarized reviews. Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph named it [...] "inarguably another fantastic display of showbiz shock <b>and</b> <b>awe</b> from a mistress of the form." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times named it [...] "the show's blasphemy quota", while Michael Hamersly of Miami Herald called it an [...] "over-the-top" [...] performance. Lindsay Zoladz of Vulture opined that it was [...] "ne of the most disappointing moments of the night". Jordan Zivitz of The Montreal Gazette opined: [...] "Twenty-six years after 'Like a Prayer' video scandalized the Vatican and parents who relied on MTV as a cheap babysitter, the sight of dancers twisting down steel crucifixes while Madonna snapped 'bitch, get off my pole' in 'Holy Water' was hopefully intended to be comical".|$|E

Shaggy and I were just fuckin' yelling over our own cassette. The people were staring at us in amazement and bewilderment. They {{must have been in}} shock <b>and</b> <b>awe.</b> We finished our two-song set, and the crowd...didn't cheer or boo.
