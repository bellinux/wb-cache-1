5000|$|At that time, Autoland {{had lower}} {{priority}} because efforts were concentrated on other projects including rapid landing of aircraft for RAF Fighter Command, visual aids for pilots, runway approach lighting and an approach aid using DME with Barbro. That changed when Operational Requirement 947 (OR947) for automatic {{landing on the}} V-Force bomber fleet was issued in 1954. [...] At that time the V-bomber force was the UK's main contribution to the strategic nuclear power of the west [...] and all-weather operation was essential. There was also renewed interest in automatic landing for civil aviation. As {{the next step in}} the development, the flare-out and coupling units from the Devon were linked to a Smiths Type D autopilot and installed in Varsity WF417, a much larger aircraft, capable of carrying 38 people rather than 10 in the Devon. The first fully automatic approach and landing was made by WF417 on 11 November 1954 under calm and misty conditions. [...] A similar system was installed in Canberra WE189 to provide the first application of Autoland to jet-type aircraft. [...] Automatic approaches [...] and automatic landings [...] were recorded by WE189 but the development was interrupted in April 1956 when the facilities at Woodbridge, which had the only suitable leader cable installation, ceased to be available to BLEU. Development of <b>auto-flare</b> and automatic kicking-off drift was continued at RAF Wittering, but in September that year WE189, returning from tests at Wittering, crashed due to engine failure on an approach when returning to its base at Martlesham Heath. The pilot, Flt. Lt. Les Coe, and the BLEU scientist in charge of the project, Mr. Joe Birkle, were killed.|$|E
