25|$|The {{traditional}} view of cephalopod evolution {{holds that}} they {{evolved in the}} Late Cambrian from a monoplacophoran-like ancestor with a curved, tapering shell, which was {{closely related to the}} gastropods (snails). The similarity of the early shelled cephalopod Plectronoceras to some gastropods was used in support of this view. The development of a siphuncle would have allowed the shells of these early forms to become gas-filled (thus buoyant) in order to support them and keep the shells upright while the animal crawled <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> and separated the true cephalopods from putative ancestors such as Knightoconus, which lacked a siphuncle. Neutral or positive buoyancy (i.e. the ability to float) would have come later, followed by swimming in the Plectronocerida and eventually jet propulsion in more derived cephalopods.|$|E

25|$|Flowing northeast, the Papakating {{passes through}} a series of named {{crossroads}} or small hamlets, including Armstrong and Pellettown in Frankford. The stream meanders through several miles of farmland <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of Kittatinny Valley. At Pellettown, formerly known as Papakating, the creek is joined by an unnamed tributary and passes under the path of County Route 565. Route 565 is a north-south county highway connecting Sussex borough and New Jersey Route 23 with Ross's Corner (its terminus) where it meets New Jersey Route 15 and U.S. Route 206. From Pelletown, the road runs roughly parallel {{to the west of the}} creek's course. A railbed constructed in the 1870s and 1880s by the Pennsylvania, Poughkeepsie & Boston Railroad (PP) for a line connecting Slatington, Pennsylvania to Pine Island, New York parallels the creek's east bank through Frankford and Wantage. This line was later operated by the Lehigh and New England Railroad until 1961.|$|E
25|$|Free kicks and dead-ball restarts {{come into}} play {{following}} a foul or other infractions. Indirect free kicks must be touched by another player before any shot is taken. Direct free kicks can be made directly on goal. Offensive players attempt numerous tricks to beat the defenders, who often form a solid wall of players {{directly in front of}} the goal. Attackers may attempt to blast the ball through the defensive wall, or curl it over or around using spin. A less common idea is to hit the ball powerfully and straight <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> since the defenders in the wall usually jump to try and prevent a shot being lifted over their heads. David Beckham, Ronaldinho, Zico, Juninho, Andrea Pirlo, Neymar, Roberto Carlos, Francesco Totti, Lionel Messi, Álvaro Recoba, Cristiano Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Juan Román Riquelme, Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney, Sejad Salihović, Rogério Ceni, Alessandro Del Piero, Thierry Henry, Roberto Baggio, Diego Maradona, Frank Lampard, Leighton Baines, Wesley Sneijder, Luis Suárez, Christian Eriksen, Miralem Pjanić and {ollen sebifelo}Gareth Bale are widely known to score from free kick positions.|$|E
25|$|The {{first leg}} of United's quarter-final against Roma was played at the Stadio Olimpico on 1 April 2008. Ryan Giggs started the match on the bench, which meant that Rio Ferdinand was handed the {{captaincy}} and Park Ji-sung was given his first Champions League appearance of the season, while Michael Carrick {{was able to take}} his position in the midfield three despite having missed the team's training session the day before. The match started fairly evenly, but it was Roma who had the first meaningful attempt on goal, with Christian Panucci heading just over from a corner. On the half hour, United's defence suffered a major setback as Nemanja Vidić fell awkwardly after jumping for a header. His place in central defence was taken by John O'Shea. Nevertheless, with just five minutes of the half remaining, the ball broke to Paul Scholes on the right hand side of the Roma penalty area. With his options limited, he played a ball at head-height into the centre of the penalty area, where Cristiano Ronaldo, who had just run full speed from near the centre circle, was ready to power a header past Roma keeper Doni. Buoyed by the cushion of the away goal, United started the second half confidently, prising a desperate Roma side apart with crisp passing <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> On the hour mark, in response to a header on goal by Mirko Vučinić that brought about a world class save from Edwin van der Sar, Alex Ferguson called for his team to adopt a more conservative formation, bringing on Owen Hargreaves to replace Anderson. United seemed more comfortable playing in a 4–4–2 formation, and the change paid immediate dividends, as Rooney pounced on Doni's mishandling of Park's header to poke the ball home for 2–0. The Reds continued to threaten, but were forced to defend well to prevent Roma from taking any goals with them to Old Trafford. The match finished 2–0, putting United in a comfortable position going into the second leg on 9 April.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{description of}} the ridge running <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle comes from the Venetian anatomist Julius Caesar Aranzi (1587), who likened it first to a silkworm {{and then to a}} seahorse (Latin: hippocampus from Greek: ἵππος, [...] "horse" [...] and κάμπος, [...] "sea monster"). The German anatomist Duvernoy (1729), the first to illustrate the structure, also wavered between [...] "seahorse" [...] and [...] "silkworm." [...] "Ram's horn" [...] was proposed by the Danish anatomist Jacob Winsløw in 1732; and a decade later his fellow Parisian, the surgeon de Garengeot, used [...] "cornu Ammonis" [...] – horn of (the ancient Egyptian god) Amun, who was often represented as having a ram's head.
