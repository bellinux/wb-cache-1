40|$|Net-zero energy {{building}} (NZEB) {{is thought}} to be the building of choice, but in practice, is <b>also</b> <b>synonym</b> to high investment cost. It is, therefore, very important to investigate if the amount of the additional capital investment could be recouped from the energy saving (or generation). The investigation is particularly meaningful for industrial halls for the great energy saving potential (with respect to the high-energy demand) and the ready energy generation possibility (due to favourable building geometry). In this paper, an integrated design approach will take into consideration parameters from the demand side to the generation side. Building energy performance simulation and optimization will be deployed to search for design solutions that are maximized for energy production capability and minimized for additional capital investment...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we give an {{overview}} of Semantic Web technologies {{and the impact of}} these ones for multilingual Web. We present a possible solution for improving the quality of on-line translation systems, using mechanisms and standards from Semantic Web. We focus on Example based machine translation and the automatization of the translation examples extraction by means of RDF-repositories. 1 Basic Principles of Semantic Web In WWW are used each year more than 5 Billion Documents from more than 800 million active users. However, up to now is WWW self-organised System without any predefined or standardised structure or administration. The huge the quantity of information in WWW becomes the more difficult its administration is. Especially the update and targeted retrieval of information are more and more difficult. Usually the information is retrieved following a key-word search. This lexical search creates several problems:- too strong specialisation (better information about „violin “ can be found maybe under „string instruments “ or 2 instruments“), because of- too many different specialised meanings, here for e. g. „instruments “ are only „music instruments “ but no surgery instruments. - No possibility of searching <b>also</b> <b>synonym...</b>|$|E
