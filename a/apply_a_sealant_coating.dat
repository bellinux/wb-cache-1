In 1978, architects Harper Sperring undertook a modernisation of the interior and {{the exterior of the}} hotel. A major repair job was undertaken on the exterior stonework on Colmore Row and Church Street which comprised <b>applying</b> <b>a</b> resin <b>sealant</b> <b>coat,</b> followed by <b>a</b> thick cement layer and then over painting. In 1982 the lease was passed to Queens' Moat Hotels; with little investment and maintenance during the 1980s and 1990s, the hotel again fell into decline. In August 2002, the hotel closed due to financial difficulties. The exterior of the building began to deteriorate because of poor quality stonework; scaffolding was erected for public safety. In 2003, plans were put forward by the owners to demolish the building as the maintenance costs were becoming too high. The Victorian Society countered these plans by putting forward an application to spot-list the building to save it from demolition. In May 2004, the building was designated with a Grade II* listing protecting it from demolition.|$|R

The request was for NIOSH to evaluate the indoor environmental quality at the Montpelier High School, particularly with regard to new carpets installed there. On March 4, 1992, NIOSH investigators interviewed teachers and collected air samples for 4 -phenylcyclohexene (4 -PC) and other volatile organic chemicals (VOCs).

50|$|The {{accident}} aircraft had, over {{a period}} of several years, developed chronic fuel leakage problems from both wings that had been remedied by the operator by repeatedly <b>applying</b> <b>a</b> <b>sealant</b> to the inside seams of the fuel tanks. Unfortunately, in applying the sealant inside the right wing tank the operator had inadvertently applied the material over a damaged lower stringer (an important, load-bearing structural member of the wing) in such a way as to conceal a fatigue crack. The crack had been discovered during previous maintenance, and an attempt was made to repair the crack by grinding it out. In applying the sealant, the operator was required to access the inside of the fuel tank using small removable inspection hatches in the top surface of the wing. This resulted in poor visibility and awkward conditions for working inside the tank. Unfortunately the sealant concealed the previous repair to the stringer and made subsequent checking for further damage to this component (i.e., any crack growth) impossible.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{assessed}} {{the impact of}} closed suction drains and evaluated whether the intraoperative use of <b>a</b> fibrin <b>sealant</b> decreased time to drain removal and wound complications in melanoma patients undergoing inguino-femoral lymph node dissection. Methods A pilot study (n = 18) {{assessed the}} impact of a closed suction drain following inguino-femoral lymph node dissection. A single-institution, prospective trial was then performed in which patients were randomized to a group that received intraoperative application of <b>a</b> fibrin <b>sealant</b> following inguino-femoral lymph node dissection or to a control group that did not receive sealant. Results The majority of the patients enrolled felt the drains caused moderate or severe discomfort and difficulties with activities of daily living. Thirty patients were then randomized; the median time to drain removal in the control group (n = 14) was 30 days (range, 13 – 74) compared to 29 days (range, 11 – 45) in the fibrin sealant group (n = 16; P = 0. 6). Major and minor complications were similar in the two groups. Conclusion Postoperative closed suction drains were associated with major patient inconvenience. <b>Applying</b> <b>a</b> fibrin <b>sealant</b> at the time of inguino-femoral lymph node dissection in melanoma patients did not reduce the time to drain removal or postoperative morbidity.

40|$|Recent {{development}} of next-generation medical devices, such as endoscopes and hearing aids, call for PZT (lead zirconate titanate oxide) thin-film sensors and actuators with thickness {{in the range}} of 1 – 30 m to enhance actuation strength and sensor sensitivity. Currently, sol–gel derived PZT films often have thickness less than 0. 2 m per coating. Moreover, thermal stresses in the films limit the crack-free area to less than 1 mm 2. This paper has four specific goals. The first goal is to demonstrate an improved sol–gel process using rapid thermal annealing and <b>a</b> diluted <b>sealant</b> <b>coating.</b> The resulting thickness can reach 2 m in three coatings with a crack-free area as large as 5 mm× 5 mm. The second goal is to characterize piezoelectric properties of the fabricated PZT films experimentally. The resulting piezoelectric constant d 33 is 120 pC/N and the dielectric constant ranges from 200 to 400. The third goal is to demonstrate the use of the PZT thin film as a calibrated sensor. The specimen is a silicon cantilever (30 mm × 7. 5 mm × 0. 4 mm) with a PZT thin film (4 mm × 4 mm × 1 m). Moreover, a tiny shaker excites the cantilever at the fixed end, and a charge amplifier detects the charge accumulated in the PZT film. In the meantime, a laser vibrometer measures the deflection of the cantilever at three points along the PZT film, from which the strain is calculated using Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. Comparison of the strain and the charge amplifier voltage determines the calibration constant of the PZT thin-film sensor. The last goal is to demonstrate the use of the PZT thin film as a powerful actuator through active vibration control. In experiments, a tiny bulk PZT patch is first glued to the silicon cantilever. A function generator drives the bulk PZT simulating a source o...|$|R

5000|$|While some {{individual}} buildings have undergone contemporary remodeling, the district retains its fundamental architectural integrity. As {{is common to}} this region, many wood-frame buildings have been sided with either vinyl or aluminum. Some houses have also had windows replaced with modern sash, resulting in some loss of architectural detail. A much smaller number have had their original sliding sash replaced with large [...] "picture" [...] windows or bay windows. In other cases, Victorian-era porch posts and ornamental details like brackets have been replaced with simple square posts or iron rod supports. Some roofs, which originally were metal (either raised seam, corrugated or a stamped pattern), have been replaced with modern composite shingle. A modest number of these early 20th century metal surfaces, which were corrugated or stamped pattern, survive. Original slate roofs exist in more significant numbers. Perhaps half of these examples have been covered with <b>a</b> silver paint <b>applied</b> as <b>a</b> <b>sealant</b> and heat reflectant. Despite the results of contemporary maintenance, {{a large majority of}} buildings retain many other significant features, such as original windows, doors, porches, chimneys and rooflines. Other underlying characteristics, such as building scale, massing, setbacks and site location, remain intact as well. Overall, most of the common renovations, such as modern siding and inappropriate porch posts, are relatively superficial and reversible if desired.|$|R

PRESENTATION OF CASEWe report {{a case of}} a 67 -year-old man who underwent mitral valve replacement and Cox Maze IV procedure. A massive bleed from the LV rupture was noted postoperatively while the patient was extubated. The control of bleeding was impossible until an IntraAortic Balloon Pump (IABP) was inserted. A bovine pericardial patch was <b>applied,</b> overlapping <b>an</b> extensive epicardial area, perimetrically of the hematoma. Between the epicardium and the pericardial patch we <b>applied</b> <b>an</b> autologous fibrin <b>sealant.</b> DISCUSSIONThe off-pump technique used to repair the LV rupture after a MVR, is more feasible when the patient is supported by an IABP that subsequently decreases the tension of the myocardial suture site.

40|$|OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: This study {{investigated}} the sealing ability of a current available unfilled fissure sealant applied over sound (n= 80), artificially created (n= 80) and naturally carious fissures (n= 80) under different humidity conditions (90 +/- 2 and 45 +/- 2 % relative humidity) and etching times (40 and 60 s). All samples were submitted to 5000 thermal cycles and examined by light microscopy after sectioning. Microleakage, penetration ability, fissure type, fissure entrance angle, sealant occlusal length, caries location and caries depth were assessed. RESULTS: The significantly longer sealant occlusal length and larger entrance angle exhibited by shallow fissures, contributed to their higher microleakage and smaller amounts of unfilled areas compared to deep fissures. Sealant microleakage was significantly influenced by {{the condition of the}} enamel (sound, artificial and natural caries) and the caries location in the fissures, but not by enamel caries depth (D 1 and D 2), etching time, or humidity condition. Natural caries exhibited significantly higher microleakage than sound or artificially created carious fissures. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that location of caries in the fissure rather than its depth should be taken into account when <b>applying</b> <b>a</b> fissure <b>sealant.</b> When the borders of the fissure sealant are on carious enamel, a significantly higher microleakage must be expected.

40|$|There is {{widespread}} acknowledgement in the Republic of South Africa that bituminous pavement cracks are formed {{either from the}} top down or from the bottom up. The top open cracks normally are associated with environmental conditions such as heat, cold thermal movements, etc. It is also caused by overloaded tyre contact stresses, which exceed the limiting strain offered by the asphalt materials. These cracks are normally wide open and crack sealing from the top is possible and relatively easy. This paper describes the South African method (materials, machine and procedures) for sealing top down cracks. The top closed crack caused by fatigue, structural inadequacies etc., are normally witnessed as fine cracks, too narrow to be sealed from the top. Because of the tightness of the bottom up cracks, they are invariably treated by <b>applying</b> <b>a</b> sheet type <b>sealant</b> system.
