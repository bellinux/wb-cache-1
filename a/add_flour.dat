40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>added</b> pumpkin <b>flour</b> (1 - 10 g/ 100 g) on sensory and textural quality of rice bread was studied on rice biologically leavened rice bread. Specific volume, baking loss, crumb springiness, {{cohesiveness}} and resilience decreased with increasing amount of pumpkin flour. The opposite trend {{was found in}} crumb hardness and chewiness. Color measurements revealed that the lightness decreased and the greenness increased with increasing amount of pumpkin flour. Bread crumb and crust characteristics were not significantly impacted {{by the amount of}} <b>added</b> pumpkin <b>flour.</b> Additionally, the bread taste and flavor were decreased in breads with 8 - 10 g/ 100 g of <b>added</b> pumpkin <b>flour,</b> resulting in their lower overall acceptability. Weak impact of <b>added</b> pumpkin <b>flour</b> on sensory evaluation of rice bread may be related to a reduced amount of the panelists involved in this study. The addition of 1 - 7 g/ 100 g of pumpkin flour seems to be applicable to rice bread production. More extensive study will, however, be performed to describe the impact of <b>added</b> pumpkin <b>flour</b> on sensory quality of rice bread in more details...|$|R

50|$|The Norwegian {{porridge}} feud (grautstriden) were {{a series}} of public debates {{that was going on}} in Norway between 1864-1866, concerned with the optimal way of cooking porridge. The participants were Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Eilert Sundt. The core of the debate was about {{whether or not it was}} redundant to <b>add</b> <b>flour</b> to porridge after cooking it. The background for the debate was that Asbjørnsen published a book in 1864 called Fornuftigt Madstel. En tidsmæssig Koge- og Husholdningsbog, under the pseudonym Clemens Bonifacius, where he argued that the addition of flour to the porridge was redundant, because the human body could simply not utilize the flour. On the other hand, Sundt argued that one should trust the competence of the Norwegian porridge makers gathered through generations.|$|E

5000|$|The {{origins of}} the egg waffle or gai daan jai (which {{literally}} translates to [...] "little chicken egg") are unknown, despite being ingrained in the memories of Hong Kong residents young and old. [...] "One story says the enterprising post-war generation created the egg-shaped mold {{to make up for}} an eggless batter, as eggs used to be a luxury. Another tale points to street hawkers who bought damaged eggs on the cheap to work them into a batter, resulting in the classic golden color of the cake. It also is reasonable to suggest that the special iron skillet used to mold the gai daan tsai is a Hong Kong take on the traditional checkered European waffle press. Today, the two related snacks are often sold by the same stall."

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine the best concentration of <b>adding</b> sago <b>flour</b> in yoghurt based on viscosity, overrun, melting rate and total solid of yoghurt ice cream. The experiment was designed by Completely Randomized Design (CRD) using four treatments were 0 %, 2 %, 4 %, 6 % from volume of fresh milk and four replications.

Result of this research showed that concentration of <b>adding</b> sago <b>flour</b> in yoghurt gave highly significant difference effect (P< 0. 01) on viscosity, overrun, melting rate and total solid of yoghurt ice cream.

40|$|ABSTRACTTwo {{improved}} {{varieties of}} cowpea (IT 89 KO and IT 90 K- 76) and one local variety (lsiocha) {{were used to}} investigate the effects of added soyflour and maize flour on the phase separation in moi-moi made from soaked cowpea and cowpea flour. Different levels (5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 % and 25 %) of maize flour, soyflour and a 1 : 1 blend of soyflour and maize flour (soy/maize <b>flour)</b> were separately <b>added.</b> The moi-moi from the different combinations was evaluated for phase separation and per cent height of the upper layer calculated. Soaking of cowpea reduced {{the size of the}} upper layer in moi-moi compared with the use of cowpea flour. The addition of maize flour or the soy/maize flour reduced the upper layer compared with when either <b>flour</b> was <b>added</b> alone. The upper layer of moi-moi made from cowpea <b>flour</b> with <b>added</b> soy <b>flour</b> (21. 20 %) was significantly higher (p 0. 05) differences in the per cent upper layers for moi-moi from all cowpea varieties when maize <b>flour</b> was <b>added.</b> Increasing the proportion of <b>added</b> <b>flours</b> increased the size of the upper layer. Complete prevention of the occurrence of phase separation in moi-moi by addition of soy flour and maize flour alone is not feasible...|$|R
