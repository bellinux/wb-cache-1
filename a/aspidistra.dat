Most {{of these}} were semi-autobiographical. Burmese Days was {{inspired}} by his period working as an imperial policeman and is fictionalized; A Clergyman's Daughter follows {{a young woman who}} passes out from overwork and wakes up an amnesiac, forced to wander the countryside as she finds herself, eventually losing her belief in God, despite being the daughter of a clergyman. Keep the <b>Aspidistra</b> Flying and Coming Up for Air are examinations of the British class system. Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four are his most famous novels: both are anti-totalitarian books which criticize the Soviet Union in particular.|$|E

25|$|In June, Burmese Days was {{published}} and Cyril Connolly's {{review in the}} New Statesman prompted Orwell (as he then became known) to re-establish contact with his old friend. In August, he moved into a flat in Kentish Town, which he shared with Michael Sayers and Rayner Heppenstall. The relationship was sometimes awkward and Orwell and Heppenstall even came to blows, though they remained friends and later worked together on BBC broadcasts. Orwell was now working on Keep the <b>Aspidistra</b> Flying, and also tried unsuccessfully to write a serial for the News Chronicle. By October 1935 his flatmates had moved out and he was struggling {{to pay the rent}} on his own. He remained until the end of January 1936, when he stopped working at Booklovers' Corner.|$|E

The Westropes were friendly and provided him with comfortable accommodation at Warwick Mansions, Pond Street. He was sharing the job with Jon Kimche, who also lived with the Westropes. Blair worked at the shop in the afternoons and had his mornings free to write and his evenings free to socialise. These experiences provided background for the novel Keep the <b>Aspidistra</b> Flying (1936). As well as the various guests of the Westropes, {{he was able to}} enjoy the company of Richard Rees and the Adelphi writers and Mabel Fierz. The Westropes and Kimche were members of the Independent Labour Party, although at this time Blair was not seriously politically active.

Poncã sob o sistema de cultivo orgânico. Os levantamentos foram realizados entre outubro de 2002 e outubro de 2003. Dentre os aleirodídeos, Aleurothrixus floccosus Maskell destacou-se dos demais, com média populacional igual a 74, 06 %. Aleurotrachelus cruzi Cassino obteve média de 52, 6 %. Entre as cochonilhas destacaram-se Selenaspidus articulatus (Morgan) (23, 96 %) e Pinnaspis <b>aspidistrae</b> (Signoret) (19, 38 %). O psilídeo Diaphorina citri Kuwayama obteve média de 52, 6 %, sendo a segunda espécie com maior média. Os pulgões Toxoptera citricida (Kirkaldy) e Toxoptera aurantii (Boyer), somente ocorreram em período de brotação e floração, com média populacional de 7, 6 % e 6, 25 %, respectivamente. Quanto à diversidade das espécies o período com maior diversidade, ocorreu na 1 ª quinzena de setembro de 2003 (H’= 0, 964), coincidindo com a menor dominância (D= 0, 200), e menor diversidade na 1 º quinzena de maio de 2003 (H’= 0, 657) e maior dominância (D= 0, 522). As espécies constantes foram: A. floccosus (100 %), A. cruzi (96 %), Coccus viridis (Green) (100 %), P. <b>aspidistrae</b> (100 %) e D. citri (100 %). As espécies mais freqüentes foram: A. floccosus (30, 79 %) e D. citri (21, 87 %). Os resultados sugerem que as espécies verificadas possuem a dinâmica populacional em parte influenciada pela competição interespecífica, pois quando há um aumento populacional dos aleirodídeos, há um decréscimo da população das cochonilhas e vice-versa, além dos fatores ambientais, a predação e o parasitismo. Sucker Insects (Sternorrhyncha) in Organic Cropping of Tangerine cv. Ponkan (Citrus reticulata Blanco) : Diversity, Constancy, Frequency and Populational Fluctuation Abstract. The aim of {{this work}} was to study the diversity, constancy, {{frequency}} and the population fluctuation of the sucker insects of the suborder Sternorrhyncha associated with the tangerine cv. Ponkan cultivated under the organic. The study was conducted from October 2002 to October 2003. Among the whiteflies, Aleurothrixus floccosus Maskell had a population average equivalent to 74. 06 %. Aleurotrachelus cruzi Cassino reached 52. 6 %. Among the scale, Selenapidus articulatus Morgan reached 23. 96 % and Pinnaspis <b>aspidistrae</b> (Signoret) 19. 38 %. The Diaphorina citri Kuwayama average was 52. 6 %, the second bigger average. The aphids Toxoptera citricida (Kirkaldy) and Toxoptera aurantii (Boyer) took place only during the budding and blooming, presenting a population average of 7. 6 % and 6. 25 %, respectively. The period in which occurred the largest diversity was the first fifteen days of September 2003 (H’= 0. 964), simultaneously to the least dominance (D = 0. 200), {{and in the first}} fifteen days of May 2003 occurred the least diversity (H’= 0. 657) and the largest dominance (D = 0. 522). The constant species that were more prominent were: A. floccosus (100 %), A. cruzi (96 %), Coccus viridis (Green) (100 %), P. <b>aspidistrae</b> (100 %) and D. citri (100 %). The most frequent species were A. floccosus (30. 79 %) and D. citri (21. 87 %). To sum up, the results show that all the species studied have a population dynamics in part influenced by the interspecific competition, as there is a population increasing of whiteflies, there is a population decrease of scale and vice-versa, as well as the environmental and predatory factors and the parasitism...|$|R

Wallington was a tiny village 35 miles north of London, and the cottage had almost no modern facilities. Orwell took over the tenancy and moved in on 2 April 1936.

Keep the <b>Aspidistra</b> Flying was published by Gollancz on 20 April 1936.

Review Tom Shone, commenting on typical and atypical features of the new novel for The Sunday Times Tom Shone, writing for The Sunday Times, praised the novel for its atypical qualities for Ellis, [...] "known for his orgies of violence". Shone asks [...] "Why is a new sequel to Less Than Zero... so moving?", noting the presence of [...] "feelings" [...] in the novel to be starkly different from Ellis' usual style. Touching on its personal qualities, Shone notes [...] "If Lunar Park unspooled the atrocities of American Psycho back to their source, Imperial Bedrooms pulls the thread further and reaches Less Than Zero". The emotive energy in the new book is traced back to the last pages of Lunar Park as well; fellow writer Jay McInerney observes that [...] "The last few pages of Lunar Park are among the most moving passages I know in recent American fiction because... Bret was coming to terms with his relationship with his father in that book." [...] Vice observes that the [...] "final passages in both Imperial Bedrooms and Lunar Park pack a lot of emotional impact." [...] San Francisco Chronicle hails Imperial Bedrooms as [...] "the very definition of authorly meta: Ellis is either so deeply enmeshed in his own creepy little insular world that he can't write his way out of it, or else he is such a genius that he's created an entire parallel universe that folds and unfolds on itself like some kind of Escher print." ...|$|R

The protagonist of Keep the <b>Aspidistra</b> Flying, Gordon Comstock, conducts an internal critique of his customers when working in a bookshop, and there is an extended passage of several pages in which he concentrates on a homosexual male customer, and sneers at him for his [...] "nancy" [...] characteristics, including a lisp, which he identifies in detail, with some disgust. Dr. Thomas S Veale, in The Banality of Virtue: A Multifaceted view of George Orwell as champion of the common man, refers to Orwell's [...] "homophobia most probably based on the perceived weakness of homosexuals and their preferences' betrayal of the natural order". Stephen Spender, however, [...] "thought Orwell's occasional homophobic outbursts were part of his rebellion against the public school".|$|E
