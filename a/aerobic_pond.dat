30|$|While waste {{stabilization}} ponds {{are responsible}} for {{a small portion of}} the world’s greenhouse gas emissions (particularly methane), there is an opportunity for the gas, commonly known as biogas, to be recovered and used as a source of energy (Konate et al. 2013). While biogas primarily consists of methane, it is also made up of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and other gases (NIWA 2008). Nevertheless, methane is the main gas targeted when considering biogas recovery. Biogas is formed either during anaerobic digestion of organic compounds or the reduction of carbon dioxide and hydrogen (El-Fadel and Massoud 2001). As a viable energy option, it has been seen as being ideal for electricity generation in a wastewater treatment plant as natural gas, provided that it has undergone several treatment processes (Craggs et al. 2014), or for heat and power (NIWA 2008). If biogas is not recovered for energy, it can be flared off or transitioned into an <b>aerobic</b> <b>pond</b> if a multiple pond system exists (NIWA 2008).|$|E

40|$|At the {{sanitary}} landfill {{of the city}} of Penzberg (Germany), two diverse approaches to leachate treatment were studied as parts of a three-stage treatment concept. The performance of a simple <b>aerobic</b> <b>pond</b> was compared to that of an advanced multistage treatment unit, the latter comprising a membrane biological reactor and a two-stage activated carbon filter. For 274 days of the year (75 %) the pond was able to provide sufficient treatment even under cold weather conditions. For temperatures lower than 5 °C, a higher biomass content and temporal storage of the raw leachate (e. g. increasing hydraulic retention time) could close the gap of insufficient treatment. In contrast, the advanced treatment system could only accomplish limited treatment capabilities due to insufficient maintenance, low loading conditions and deficient coordination between the individual treatment steps. As a result, degradation rates were low and operational problems frequent. Limits for Ntot were exceeded regularly (Ntot,e = 60 - 70 mg/L), throughput broke down and excessive nitrite production occurred (NO 2 -Ne = 10 mg/L) as a result of microbial activity inside the activated carbon filters. This case study clearly suggests aerobic ponds as an appropriate solution for the treatment of landfill leachate in areas where operational independence is essential...|$|E

50|$|Aerobic {{bacteria}} {{grow in the}} <b>aerobic</b> <b>ponds</b> and {{are able}} to decompose organic waste into oxidized products. Cyanobacteria are typically grown in <b>aerobic</b> <b>ponds</b> in order to provide the bacteria in the pond with plenty of oxygen. Anaerobic ponds contain anaerobic bacteria, which are able to breakdown complex organic waste into basic compounds that are less harmful to the environment. There are several kinds of algae that grow in treatment ponds such as green, red and brown algae. In most ponds both bacteria and algae are needed in order to maximize the decomposition of chemicals. Bacteria and algae work in tandem with bacteria breaking down the complex compounds and chemicals. Then the algae decompose the newly formed compounds {{and are able to}} produce oxygen for the bacteria that need it. Several types of invertebrates are present in the ponds here they maintain algae levels and help allow the sediment to settle on the bottom. With mosquitos being a problem for those who maintain the ponds the addition of mosquito fish and several other types of predatory fish is good {{in order to keep the}} bugs in check. They are primarily used for mosquito control as treatment ponds are fantastic breeding grounds for mosquitos. By adding the fish the ponds bug issues are controlled in a natural and environmentally friendly way without having to use harmful chemicals.|$|R
40|$|Passive {{treatment}} of mine water uses {{chemical and biological}} processes to decrease metal concentrations and neutralize acidity. Compared to conventional chemical treatment, passive methods generally require more land area, but use less costly reagents, and require less operational attention and maintenance. Currently, the three most common types of passive technologies are <b>aerobic</b> <b>ponds</b> and wetlands, anoxic limestone drains (ALDs), and reducing and alkalinity-producing systems (RAPS). Aerobic wetlands promote mixed oxidation and hydrolysis reactions, and are effective when the raw mine water is net alkaline. Anoxic limestone drains generate bicarbonate alkalinity {{and can be used}} to convert water that is net acidic into netalkaline water for treatment in <b>aerobic</b> <b>ponds</b> and wetlands. RAPS promote reducing conditions and limestone dissolution. They extend the concept of ALDs by pre-treating the water before it contacts the limestone, to eliminate dissolved oxygen and reduce dissolved ferric iron to ferrous iron. These systems can generally be used to treat more acidic water than ALDs, and can better treat water with significant aluminum concentrations. In passive treatment systems, rates of metal and acidity removal and alkalinity generation have been developed empirically. Aerobic wetlands remove iron from alkaline water at rates of 10 to 20 g m & 2 d & 1. Anoxic limestone drains add 150 to 300 mg/L of alkalinity in about 15 hours of contact, imparting 5 to 20 mg/L of alkalinity per hour of contact. Reducing and alkalinityproducing systems add 15 to 60 g m & 2 d & 1 of alkalinity, depending on influent water quality and contact time.

The work comprised of setting up pilot scale Modified Ponds in a manner to facilitate the treatment process in lesser time with better treatment efficiency. Experimental work had two cases depending on many considerations such as economical and specification of final effluent. A conventional model of three ponds in series was used as first case of experimental work.

40|$|It is {{apparent}} that present dairyshed effluent treatment systems are not capable of complying with regulations generated by Regional Councils implementing the Resource Management Act 1991. This has created a need for research into dairyshed effluent treatment. To develop an improved treatment system for dairyshed effluent, research was conducted with two main study objectives; to characterise effluent from the dairyshed holding yard and anaerobic pond, {{and to develop a}} sequencing batch reactor (SBR) for the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus. The carbon characterisation showed that there was a large difference between dairyshed effluent and domestic effluent in the proportion of carbon in each fraction. When treating dairyshed wastewater to reduce BOD, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations {{it was not possible to}} treat either the yard effluent or the anaerobic effluent without addition of external materials. The BOD reaction rate constant for the yard effluent at 0. 2 d - 1 was similar to a typical domestic wastewater value of 0. 23 d - 1. The anaerobic pond effluent BOD reaction rate constant of 0. 16 d - 1 was lower than the yard effluent value indicating that the anaerobically treated effluent was hard to treat aerobically. A pilot scale SBR treating dairyshed effluent was operated for 75 days. Startup procedure used a 50 / 50 mixture of anaerobic pond and <b>aerobic</b> <b>pond</b> effluents which was successful in establishing a biomass capable of nitrifying anaerobic pond effluent. The startup time to establish a nitrifying population was 17 days. The sludge was found to settle well, with a maximum sludge volume index of 54 ml/g measured during the SBR operation. Sludge bulking was not seen as a problem. Nitrification performance a large proportion of the bacteria were lost took only 5 days to recover. With the addition of alkalinity nitrification reliably reduced the effluent ammonia concentration to 5 mg/l. From the cycle analysis the first order reaction rate constants for nitrification were; ammonia reduction 0. 7 hr - 1, TKN reduction 0. 4 hr - 1 and nitrate formation 0. 2 hr - 1.

Many improvements have been made to improve their effectiveness and efficiency at turning harmful chemicals and sewage into less harmful forms of the previous. With ponds there is a variety of key elements to take care of in order to be properly maintained for the wastewater to be properly treated. Factors such as oxygen levels and flow through the ponds are just a few of the critical factors to properly maintaining the ponds. These factors are constantly monitored to maintain the pond and gain information on what factors are working the best in order to speed up the breakdown of harmful chemicals at the most efficient rate.

This study evaluates treatment of net-acidic, oxic, iron-laden AMD with limestone alone, and with organic-rich compost layered with the limestone. In the fall of 2003, a treatment system consisting of two parallel, 500 -m 2 downflow cells followed by a 400 -m 2 aerobic settling pond and wetland was installed to neutralize the AMD from the Bell Mine, a large source of AMD and baseflow to the Schuylkill River in the Southern Anthracite Coalfield, in east-central Pennsylvania. Each downflow cell consisted of a lower substrate layer of 1, 090 metric tons (t) of dolomitic limestone (60 wt% CaCO 3) and an upper layer of 300 t of calcitic limestone (95 wt% CaCO 3); one of the downflow cells also included a 0. 3 m thick layer of mushroom compost over the limestone. AMD with pH of 3. 5 – 4. 3, dissolved oxygen of 6. 6 – 9. 9 mg/L, iron of 1. 9 – 5. 4 mg/L, and aluminum of 0. 8 – 1. 9 mg/L flooded each cell to a depth 0. 65 m above the treatment substrates, percolated through the substrates to underlying, perforated outflow pipes, and then flowed through the <b>aerobic</b> <b>pond</b> and wetland before discharging to the Schuylkill River.

Once the pond has been designed the next thing that must be considered is the location of the pond. The size depends on the type of wastewater entering the pond, the type of pond and location in order to begin to size it. Depths usually range from between four and twenty feet deep with the type of bacteria and total amount of waste the plant must treat being the determining factor in the design of depth. With a key factor in determination of size being how much wastewater is going to be treated by the pond the question of how much surface area is needed varies from a few thousand feet to many acres. Anaerobic ponds must be designed to be far deeper than either <b>aerobic</b> or facultative <b>ponds,</b> this is in order to decrease the oxygen levels in the deeper parts of the ponds so the bacteria can do their jobs, eating the waste. <b>Aerobic</b> <b>ponds</b> must be shallower with a great surface area so that more oxygen can dissolve into the water giving the bacteria enough oxygen to properly function. Facultative ponds meet somewhere in the middle in their design with a large surface area and a fairly deep design to allow for both bacteria to function properly.Usually, common reed or Phragmites australis are used in treatment ponds (e.g., in greywater treatment systems to purify wastewater).

The mills are concentrated in five districts along the western and eastern coasts, Aceh Utara, Aceh Timur, Aceh Tamiang, Nagan Raya, and Aceh Singkil (including the newly-established municipality of Subullusalam). As the climatic conditions in the Aceh are suitable for palm trees, the oil palm plantation area has expanded every year. The processing of FFB (Fresh fruit bunches) in palm oil mill produced a biomass residue that mainly consist of EFB (Empty fruit bunches), fiber, shells, and POME (Palm oil mill effluent). This study investigates the potential usage of biomass residue from palm oil mills in Aceh province. Results of the study indicated that the fiber and shells are mainly used as fuel for the mill boilers to generate heat and electricity for the whole plant. The EFB is disposed and spread on the plantation, incinerated or dumped in unmanaged sites.

40|$|Microbial {{fuel cells}} (MFCs) are bioelectrochemical systems able to {{generate}} electricity from wetland soils, including paddies, exploiting the microbial decomposition of organic matter. A MFC is composed of an anode buried in the anaerobic submerged soil linked to a cathode placed {{on the top of}} the soil in the <b>aerobic</b> <b>ponding</b> water. A biofilm develops on the anode, where bacteria release electrons, oxidizing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and using oxygen available at the cathode as electron acceptor. MFC technology is now in an early development stage and the efficiency in electricity production is still low. However, MFC can also be applied for secondary aims, among which one of great interest is the reduction of methane (CH 4) emissions from paddy fields. Indeed, DOC oxidation at the anode can be seen as an additional DOC sink in paddy soil environment, limiting the DOC availability for methanogens. In this work, a process-based mathematical model is proposed for a preliminary investigation of the efficiency of MFCs in limiting CH 4 emissions. The model relies on a system of partial differential mass balance equations to describe the vertical dynamics of the chemical compounds leading to CH 4 production. Many physicochemical processes and features characteristic of paddy soil are included: paddy soil stratigraphy; spatio-temporal variations of plant-root compartment; water and heat transport; SOC decomposition; heterotrophic reactions in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions; root radial oxygen loss; root solute uptake; DOC root exudation; plantmediated, ebullition, and diffusion gas exchange pathways. MFC is modeled as a DOC sink term, following a zero-order kinetic where the current density is assumed constant for the whole growing season. Different values of current density are tested, in accordance with values reported in literature about efficiency reached in paddy soils. Our results show a reduction of CH 4 emissions up to - 28. 1 %, - 24. 1 %, and - 26. 5 % of daily minimum, daily maximum and total over the whole growing season, respectively, confirming the potential validity of MFC as a novel CH 4 mitigation strategy.

The two sets of 3 -day HRT ponds were run in series {{to determine the effect}} on productivity associated with recycling growth media without supplemental nutrient addition. The first pond in series was referred to as round 1 and the second as round 2. Due to solids accumulation in the 2 -day HRT ponds in summer proper biomass productivity values could not be determined. 4 -inch standpipes were determined to cause the solids accumulation when large flocs were present in ponds. As a possible solution to the solids accumulation issue, a ramped standpipe was designed and installed in one pond per triplicate set. In winter the 2 -day HRT pond was roughly 37 % more productive than the 3 -day HRT. In summer the round 1 (3 -day HRT) ponds were roughly 33 % more productive than the round 2 (3 -day HRT) ponds. In winter the round 1 (3 -day HRT) ponds were roughly 19 % more productive than the round 2 (3 -day HRT) ponds. The type of standpipe (ramped or 4 -inch) did not cause a significant amount of solids accumulation in either of the 3 -day HRT ponds. The type of standpipe did {{make a difference in the}} 2 -day HRT ponds. On average the 4 -inch standpipe pond had 35 % higher TSS than the ramped standpipe ponds. In addition to these field experiments, laboratory aerobic degradation experiments were conducted to determine the nutrient release of previously digested sludge in <b>aerobic</b> <b>ponds.</b> Pretreatment of algae sludge did not have a significant effect on nutrient release of previously anaerobically digested algae sludge in aerobic conditions. The maximum soluble nitrogen generated in the aeration reactors was between 56 % for the treated sludge, and 66 % for the untreated sludge...|$|R

In this study, a sand filtration-dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) system was investigated {{as an alternative}} process for treating POME. This system can reduce land usage, processing time and costs compared to conventional systems. The removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD 5), and oil-grease {{in relation to the}} applied voltage were studied. Furthermore, the pH and temperature profiles were investigated. The obtained results indicate that the removal efficiency of COD, BOD 5, and oil-grease increased with an increase of the applied voltage.

40|$|The {{rising level}} of {{pollution}} in rivers, lakes and other {{bodies of water}} has created problems of significant magnitude in Southeast Asia. Apart from the aesthetic desirability of clean rivers are the pressing dangers to health and detrimental effects on aquatic life. Pollution of these sources must be controlled {{so as not to}} interfere with the waters' legitimate uses. Waste stabilization ponds are well-accepted as an effective and economical means of waste disposal. A "stabilization pond" is an artificially created body of water intended to retain sewage or organic wastes until biological processes have rendered the wastes stable. The stabilization process consists of bacteria and algae interaction. Bacteria oxidize the wastes and produce sludge, carbon dioxide and ammonia. The nutrients produced from bacterial oxidation, along with light energy, supply the requirements for algal photosynthesis. Algae produce oxygen needed to sustain the treatment process. Optimum detention time refers to the average length of time required for waste to become stabilized within a pond. Properly designed and operated, a stabilization pond can provide treatment comparable to a more costly waste treatment plant. However, the design criteria for a particular climate may not be applicable to other climates. This study was conducted to establish suitable detention times for <b>aerobic</b> stabilization <b>ponds</b> in Southeast Asia...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{evaporation}} ponds {{are commonly}} used to reduce the volume of seleniferous agricultural drainage water in the San Joaquin Valley, Calif. These hypersaline ponds pose an environmental health hazard because they are heavily contaminated with selenium (Se), mainly {{in the form of}} selenate. Se in the ponds may be removed by microbial Se volatilization, a bioremediation process whereby toxic, bioavailable selenate is converted to relatively nontoxic dimethylselenide gas. In order to identify microbes that may be used for Se bioremediation, a 16 S ribosomal DNA phylogenetic analysis of an <b>aerobic</b> hypersaline <b>pond</b> in the San Joaquin Valley showed that a previously unaffiliated group of uncultured bacteria (belonging to the order Cytophagales) was dominant, followed by a group of cultured γ-Proteobacteria which was closely related to Halomonas species. Se K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy of selenate-treated bacterial isolates showed that they accumulated a mixture of predominantly selenate and a selenomethionine-like species, consistent with the idea that selenate was assimilated via the S assimilation pathway. One of these bacterial isolates (Halomonas-like strain MPD- 51) was the best candidate for the bioremediation of hypersaline evaporation ponds contaminated with high Se concentrations because it tolerated 2 M selenate and 32. 5 % NaCl, grew rapidly in media containing selenate, and accumulated and volatilized Se at high rates (1. 65 μg of Se g of protein− 1 h− 1), compared to other cultured bacterial isolates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Most of {{domestic}} wastewater is either untreated or only primarily settled by septic tanks in Taiwan. Manure produced by concentrated swine operations {{is also one}} of the primary pollution sources of watercourses. Recently, constructed wetlands have received tremendous interests as one of the contemporary alternatives employing to enhance the water quality regarding nitrogen nutrients due to the deterioration of groundwater quality. Wetlands can be employed to enhance water quality, with saving in infrastructure construction costs as well as providing economic, environmental, and social benefits. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the nitrogen nutrients removal mechanisms and efficiency within the field scale natural purification systems. The systems included an oxidation pond, two serial surface flow wetlands with a cascade in between, and a subsurface flow system. These water purification systems received secondary treated sewage as their inflow. The macrophytes within the study system were submergent plants including cattails and reeds. The average BOD and COD percent removal efficiency was approximately 86 and 42 %, respectively. The ratio of BOD to COD decreased from 0. 63 in the initial aerobic compartment to 0. 16 in anoxic parts of the systems, indicating most biological degradable materials were decomposed in the <b>aerobic</b> oxidation <b>pond</b> and surface flow wetlands. Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and ammonium decreased from 7. 58 to 2. 45 and 5. 46 to 1. 86 mg/L, respectively, while nitrate nitrogen increased from 1. 86 to 5. 68 mg/L within the aerobic oxidation pon...|$|R
40|$|The {{wastewater}} {{produced by}} Carter Holt Harvey’s Kinleith {{pulp and paper}} mill in Tokoroa is currently treated {{by a series of}} <b>aerobic</b> <b>ponds,</b> designed to remove organic pollutants. The treatment system has experienced increases in Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD, a measure of organic pollution strength) at the outlet. The increases in BOD happened when no significant changes in wastewater influent flow and/or characteristics were recorded. The surge in BOD has caused the outlet discharge limit to be exceeded in the past. Based on previous studies, we believe that aerobic oxidation of methane (CH 4), by microorganisms called methanotrophs, can cause the generation of methanol (a compound that can cause an increase in BOD load in waste streams), under conditions that repress the further conversion of methanol into biomass and carbon dioxide (CO 2). The overall objectives of this project therefore were: ? To determine if the biosynthesis of CH 4 can occur in the treatment system ? To determine if the subsequent biological aerobic CH 4 oxidation to methanol can occur in the treatment system ? Whether enough methanol can be generated to affect the treatment system’s performance in terms of BOD removal. Evidence was found that confirmed CH 4 was formed in the pond sediments across the entire treatment system (with rates significantly higher near the inlet). CH 4 is therefore available in the treatment system for aerobic CH 4 oxidation. The presence of aerobic conditions and the absence of dissolved CH 4 in the water column (part of the pond where wastewater flows above the sediment), showed that aerobic CH 4 oxidation can occur in the water column of the treatment system (except at the oxygen limited inlet). Laboratory testing also confirmed that aerobic CH 4 oxidation can occur and methanotrophs are present (albeit in small numbers) in the water column. A model was used to determine if aerobic CH 4 oxidation to methanol can cause the BOD increase at the outlet. The model found that the rates (CH 4 production in the sediment and CH 4 oxidation in the water column) needed to cause the surge in BOD was significantly higher than the maximum rates calculated from laboratory tests ofsamples collected from the treatment system. Aerobic CH 4 oxidation was therefore unlikely to cause the BOD increase at the outlet. It is possible that the BOD increase is due to benthic feedback (anaerobic sludge layer becomes buoyant, suddenly releasing soluble compounds into the aerobic water column of a pond). The BOD increase experienced at the outlet followed similar characteristics associated with benthic feedback (event was random, occurred at a pond with an oxygen limited sludge layer and aerobic water column). If the cause of the BOD increase needs to be determined in the future, further investigation into benthic feedback is recommended. To conclude, aerobic CH 4 oxidation to methanol can occur in the treatment system, but is unlikely to cause the BOD increase at the outlet of the treatment system. The technical capabilities and knowledge developed during the project will likely benefit those in the pulp mill industry. Methods and techniques have been developed to investigate the generation and fate of CH 4 within a pulp mill aerated pond...|$|R
40|$|INFLUENCE OF ANAEROBIC TECHNOLOGY ON BIODEGRADATION OF COMPOUND PRECURSORS WITH HORMONAL ACTIVITY CONTAINED IN EFFLUENTS OF THE KRAFT CELLULOSE INDUSTRY Chile {{produces}} an annual average of 2 {{million tons of}} Kraft cellulose for which pine and eucalyptus are used as raw material. New investments indicate the possibility of increasing the cellulose production in 50 % in the next decade. These kinds of industries consume great amounts of water and chemical reactants and generate active organic waste, which {{have been identified as}} the main causes for negative environmental impacts of the Kraft cellulose industry. The Kraft pulping process uses an alkaline solution and sodium sulphur in the digestion to dissolve lignin and release cellulose fibres. After digestion, cellulose fibres are separated through filtering processes and the filtered product is called “black liquor”, which is usually recovered through evaporation and combustion. In spite of this, operation of this equipment is not always optimal. On the other hand, some industries will continue operating with old technologies. Due to the above, there is {{a small part of the}} black liquor that remains in the fibre and is dragged by it into the washing and bleaching process. These compounds contribute to the acute and chronic toxicity of effluents to which fish are exposed, that include, among others, alterations at the level (profile) of sexual steroids in fish plasma and decrease in their reproductive adaptation. In this last case, the compounds responsible for these effects are known as sterols and resinic acids, whose concentration is closely related to the type of raw material used by the Kraft cellulose industry (pine or eucalyptus). Studies conducted in the USA, Canada and Finland, among others, show the incidence of sterols and resinic acids in the discharge effluent from industries of processing of Kraft cellulose and pulp, which use treatments through aerated <b>ponds</b> and <b>aerobic</b> biological systems. However, there are no studies on the behaviour of these compounds in anaerobic treatment systems. Anaerobic biological treatments have advantages in comparison to aerobic systems in terms of low production of biological solids, nutritional requirements and operation with high organic loads. This allows thinking that anaerobic digestion might be a feasible alternative for cellulose plants that have already implemented new bleaching processes (lower toxicity in the final effluent), but that address the degradation of specific compounds, such as sterols. Due to the above stated, the project has the fundamental objective of studying the influence of anaerobic technology on biodegradation of precursors of compounds with hormonal activity contained in effluents of the Kraft cellulose industry. In order to conduct this research, the anaerobic biodegradation of precursors of compounds with hormonal activity (sterols and resinic acids) contained in effluents from the Kraft cellulose industry was studied in optimized systems. Results obtained show that resinic acids cannot be degraded in anaerobic systems, while they are completely mineralized in aerobic systems. The influence of technology, in turn, may affect sterols biodegradation. <b>Aerobic</b> <b>ponds</b> feature an incomplete mineralization of these compounds which is strongly dependant on the type of system operation. While in aerated systems, such as optimized activated muds, these compounds can be totally biodegraded. Analyses of cellulose effluents through bioindicators show that they can produce chronic toxicity in Daphnia. Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica - CONICY...|$|R
40|$|Indonesia and Malaysia {{are known}} as the largest {{countries}} of palm oil producer in the world. Along the development of palm oil industry in Indonesia, there is more liquid waste from manufacturing process of palm oil which is known as Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME). POME has been treated using method of <b>aerobic</b> and anaerobic <b>ponds</b> to reduce COD and BOD contents, whereas POME still contains nutrients such as C,N,P which are useful as a nutrient {{for the growth of}} microalgae. In this research,cultivation of Spirulina platensis cultivated in POME media with various concentrations of 20 %, 40 %, and 60 % V. Urea, NaHCO 3, and TSP were given each two days as a nutrient. The cultivation process carried out for 7 days with aeration and 24 hours lighting. The result shows that the best cultivation media is POME with a concentration of 20 %. The best nutrient composition is the addition of 25 mg/l Urea, TSP 50 mg/l and 200 mg/l NaHCO 3. At the same treatment on a variety of media is obtained that the maximum growth rate of Spirulina platensis is μ = 0. 128 /day.
