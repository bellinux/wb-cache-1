5|$|By now aged nearly 56, Kruger {{resolved}} that {{he could}} no longer travel constantly between Boekenhoutfontein <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital,</b> and in August 1881 he and Gezina moved to Church Street, Pretoria, from where he could easily walk to the government offices on Church Square. Also around this time he shaved off his moustache and most of his facial hair, leaving the chinstrap beard he kept thereafter. His and Gezina's permanent home on Church Street, what is now called Kruger House, would be completed in 1884.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the uprising, the army of Russia un{{successfully}} tried to capture the capital of Poland on two occasions. First in February 1831, forces under Field Marshal Hans Karl von Diebitsch stormed the eastern suburb of Praga. After a bloody battle at Grochów, the Polish Army successfully retreated to Warsaw, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> remained in Polish hands.|$|E

5|$|The ARS had the Blue Line end at Addison Road. However, {{sports fans}} {{continually}} {{argued for a}} three-mile (5km) extension to the Capital Centre sports arena in Largo, Maryland.

By the time the extension opened in 2004, professional basketball and hockey had relocated to a new arena atop the Gallery Place Station <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capital</b> Centre was replaced with a shopping mall. However, the extension still drew considerable sport spectator traffic because it is {{within walking distance of}} the FedExField football stadium. The extension cost $456 million.|$|E

5|$|A new {{professional}} indoor lacrosse league {{was created}} in the 1970s with the formation of the original National Lacrosse League. This league opened in 1974 with teams in Montreal, Toronto, Rochester, Syracuse, Philadelphia, and Maryland. For the 1975 season, Rochester moved to Boston, Syracuse moved to Quebec City, and Toronto moved to Long Island. Thus, by its second year, the original NLL was playing in all major league arenas: the Colisée de Québec, the Montreal Forum, the Boston Garden, Nassau Coliseum, the Spectrum, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capital</b> Centre. When the two wealthier '75 NLL franchises, Philadelphia and Maryland, finished out of the playoffs, and with Montreal losing access to the fabled Montreal Forum in the upcoming season due to the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games, the league folded after two seasons due to financial uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time that Villa and Orozco were marching on Ciudad Juárez, the Zapatista revolt {{gathered}} strength and spread to the states of Puebla, Tlaxcala, Mexico, Michoacán and Guerrero. On April 14, Madero had Emiliano Zapata officially designated as his representative in the region. However, Zapata was worried that if he did not fully control all the major towns in Morelos by the time that Madero concluded negotiations with Díaz, the demands of his agrarian movement and the issue of the autonomy of Morelos would be ignored or sidelined. Zapata's first military action was to take the town of Chinameca where he obtained essential supplies. Subsequently, Zapata, for political and strategic reasons, decided to attack the city of Cuautla. In order to mislead his opponents however, he initially attacked and captured the towns of Izúcar de Matamoros (which was subsequently retaken by federal forces) and Chietla. From there he made a wide circle around Cuautla and captured Yautepec and Jonacatepec where he gathered more supplies, munitions and soldiers. By May, out of all the major urban centers in the region, only Cuautla <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> of Morelos, Cuernavaca, remained outside of his control.|$|E

5|$|Fustat was {{the capital}} of Egypt for {{approximately}} 500 years. After the city's founding in 641, its authority was uninterrupted until 750, when the Abbasid dynasty staged a revolt against the Umayyads. This conflict was focused not in Egypt, but elsewhere in the Arab world. When the Abbasids gained power, they moved various capitals to more controllable areas. They had established the centre of their caliphate in Baghdad, moving the capital from its previous Umayyad location at Damascus. Similar moves were made throughout the new dynasty. In Egypt, they moved the capital from Fustat slightly north to the Abbasid city of al-Askar, which remained the capital until 868. When the Tulunid dynasty took control in 868, the Egyptian capital moved briefly to another nearby northern city, Al-Qatta'i. This lasted only until 905, when Al-Qatta'i was destroyed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> was returned to Fustat. The city again lost its status as capital city when its own vizier, Shawar, ordered its burning in 1168. The capital of Egypt was ultimately moved to Cairo.|$|E
5|$|MD 5 was {{designated}} in 1927 {{to run from}} Point Lookout to the Washington, D.C. border in Suitland. The route was realigned to follow Naylor Road to the Washington, D.C. line in 1939, while MD 637 {{was designated}} along the portion of Branch Avenue leading to the border. Between 1939 and 1949, the route continued into Washington, D.C. as District of Columbia Route 5 (DC 5), which followed Naylor Road, Good Hope Road, 11th Street SE, and DC 4 (Pennsylvania Avenue) to US 1 and US 240 near the White House. MD 5 was realigned {{to head to the}} Washington, D.C. border along Branch Avenue in 1950. During the course of the 1950s and 1960s, most of MD 5 between the MD 235 intersection and the Washington, D.C. border was widened into a divided highway. In 1993, the route bypassed Leonardtown; the original alignment was designated MD 5 Business (MD 5 Bus.) before it was decommissioned in 2012. In 1997, MD 5 was realigned to bypass Waldorf to the east along what had been designated as MD 205 in 1989. The former alignment through Waldorf followed what is now MD 5 Bus. and US 301. In Prince George's County, multiple interchanges were built along MD 5 between MD 223 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capital</b> Beltway in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2007, a four-lane, divided bypass of Hughesville was completed, alleviating the traffic bottleneck within that town at the intersection of MD 231. The former alignment through Hughesville became MD 5 Bus. The portion of MD 5 between US 301 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capital</b> Beltway is slated to be upgraded to a full freeway, with an interchange at MD 373 (Accokeek Road)/Brandywine Road planned and the remainder still in the planning stages.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{his tenure}} is {{associated}} with a major success of long-term significance, the capture of Malta. Of all the islands around Sicily, this was the last to remain in Byzantine hands, and in 869 a fleet under Ahmad ibn Umar ibn Ubaydallah ibn al-Aghlab al-Habashi attacked it. The Byzantines, having received timely reinforcements, resisted successfully at first, but in 870 Muhammad sent a fleet from Sicily to the island, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> Melite fell on 29 August 870. The local governor was captured, the town was plundered—Ahmad al-Habashi reportedly took along the local cathedral's marble columns to decorate his palace—and its fortifications razed. The fall of Malta had important ramifications for the defence of what remained of Byzantine Sicily: with Reggio in Calabria and now Malta in their hands, the Muslims completed their encirclement of the island, and could easily interdict any aid sent from the east.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June, Van der Sloot {{was arrested}} near Curacaví by the Investigations Police of Chile while {{traveling}} {{in a rented}} taxi on Highway 68 between the coastal city of Viña del Mar <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> of Santiago. He was found with a laptop, foreign currency, a business card case, detailed charts of ocean currents around Lima, and bloody clothes. His phone's SIM card was missing, which made mobile phone tracking of his location impossible. He told Chilean police that unidentified armed robbers hid {{in the hotel room}} and killed Flores when she disobeyed their order to be quiet. Van der Sloot's Dutch attorney claimed that his client {{was on his way to}} Santiago to turn himself in. He was subsequently expelled and transported by Chilean police in a Cessna 310 back to Arica to be handed over to Peruvian authorities at the Chacalluta border crossing on 4 June.|$|E
5|$|On December 3, 1855, the {{legislature}} convened in Corvallis and quickly introduced legislation {{to move the}} capital back to Salem. This bill passed on December 15, 1855. Three days later, {{the legislature}} re-convened in Salem. However, the statehouse burned down on the 29th, and the legislature re-opened debate about where to seat the capital. They decided to ask {{the people of the}} territory to vote on the question. A vote was to be held in June 1856, after which the two cities receiving the most votes would have a runoff. The initial vote set up a runoff between Eugene and Corvallis, but after some ballots were invalidated due to not being cast in accordance with the law, the two winners were Eugene and Salem. An October runoff gave Eugene the most votes, but the earlier vote-tossing led to a low turnout. With such low public participation, the election was ignored, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> remained in Salem.|$|E
