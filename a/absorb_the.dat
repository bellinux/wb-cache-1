5|$|In Yusnaan, Lightning infiltrates Snow's {{palace and}} finds him {{preparing}} {{to enter a}} concentration of Chaos contained inside the palace. He plans to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> Chaos, transform into a Cie'th, and have Lightning kill him. Though he performs the act and they fight, Lightning manages to renew his hope of seeing Serah again, reverse his transformation and lift his burden.|$|E
5|$|The 24th Infantry Division was {{the first}} US unit sent into Korea to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> initial North Korean advances, and disrupt the more {{numerous}} North Korean units. The 24th Division effectively delayed the North Korean advance to allow the 7th Infantry Division, 25th Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry Division, and other Eighth Army supporting units to establish a defensive line around Pusan.|$|E
5|$|White roofs: Painting rooftops {{white has}} become a common {{strategy}} to reduce the heat island effect. In cities, there are many dark colored surfaces that <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> heat of the sun in turn lowering the albedo of the city. White rooftops allow high solar reflectance and high solar emittance, increasing the albedo of the city or area the effect is occurring.|$|E

5|$|All three {{ships were}} {{fitted with a}} shallow anti-torpedo bulge {{integral}} to the hull which was intended to explode the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and vent the underwater explosion to the surface rather than into the ship. However, later testing proved {{that it was not}} deep enough to accomplish its task as it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> force of the explosion.|$|E
5|$|As a naturalistic writer, he was {{amongst the}} first English-language authors to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> {{lessons of the}} French realists, and was {{particularly}} influenced by the works of Émile Zola. His writings influenced James Joyce, according to the literary critic and biographer Richard Ellmann, and, although Moore's work is sometimes seen as outside the mainstream of both Irish and British literature, he is as often regarded as the first great modern Irish novelist.|$|E
5|$|As combat {{operations}} quickly revealed, {{the two sides}} were badly mismatched. FANK, whose ranks had been increased by thousands of young urban Cambodians who had flocked to join it {{in the months following}} the removal of Sihanouk, had expanded well beyond its capacity to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> new men. Later, given the press of tactical operations and the need to replace combat casualties, there was insufficient time to impart needed skills to individuals or to units, and lack of training remained the bane of FANK's existence until its collapse.|$|E

5|$|Coprinopsis variegata can attack soil bacteria, such as {{species of}} Pseudomonas and Agrobacterium, {{and use them}} as {{nutrient}} sources. The fungus achieves this by growing specialized hyphae {{in the direction of}} the bacteria, sensing them with some chemoattractive mechanism not yet fully understood. The fungus then secretes compounds to digest the bacteria while growing assimilative hyphae to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> nutrients. The process is relatively rapid, and bacterial colonies can be assimilated in less than 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|Dawson College {{began in}} 1945 as a {{satellite}} campus of McGill to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> anticipated influx of students after World War II. Many {{students in their}} first 3 years in the Faculty of Engineering took courses at Dawson College to relieve the McGill campus for the later two years for their degree course. Dawson eventually became independent of McGill and evolved into the first English CEGEP in Quebec. Another CEGEP, John Abbott College, was established in 1971 at the campus of McGill's Macdonald College.|$|E
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution in Europe, {{demand for}} {{alkaline}} substances increased. A new industrial process developed by Nicolas Leblanc of Issoundun, France enabled cheap large-scale production of sodium carbonate (soda ash). In this Leblanc process, common salt {{is converted to}} soda ash, using sulfuric acid, limestone, and coal, releasing hydrogen chloride as a by-product. Until the British Alkali Act 1863 and similar legislation in other countries, the excess HCl was vented into the air. After {{the passage of the}} act, soda ash producers were obliged to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> waste gas in water, producing hydrochloric acid on an industrial scale.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, Thermal Belt Telephone <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> {{operations}} of Eastern Rowan Telephone, Mid-Carolina Telephone, and Mooresville Telephone.

5|$|Generally sharks {{have only}} one layer of tesserae, but the jaws of large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the great white shark, have two to three layers or more, {{depending}} on body size. The jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers. In the rostrum (snout), the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> power of impacts.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Lowell also {{published}} The Biglow Papers, later {{named by the}} Grolier Club as the most influential book of 1848. The first 1,500 copies sold out within {{a week and a}} second edition was soon issued—though Lowell made no profit, as he had to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> cost of stereotyping the book himself. The book presented three main characters, each representing different aspects of American life and using authentic American dialects in their dialogue. Under the surface, The Biglow Papers was also a denunciation of the Mexican–American War and war in general.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway {{raised its}} prices for coal haulage. All coal hauled on the Tramway needed {{to pass along}} the A from Verney Junction or Aylesbury and Jones had to raise prices to cover the {{surcharge}} or keep prices stable despite the loss of profits. Road-hauled coal from Bicester was already undercutting the Tramway and the unreliable engines had given the Tramway a poor reputation. Jones kept prices fixed and <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> increased costs, wrecking the Tramway's already declining business.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, Riverkeeper was alerted of a sewage leak in the kill, noting {{high levels}} of {{bacteria}} indicating the presence of fecal matter. A New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) investigation found nearby private sewer pipes and manholes {{to be filled with}} sludge; they were cleaned and plans have been instated to ensure that sewers would stay clear henceforth. An oil spill was observed in the kill in 2016 and DEC staff were again sent to respond. The DEC installed booms to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> oil and began an investigation into the spill's source, which was unknown as of December 6.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve air quality, the city placed {{restrictions}} on construction sites and gas stations, and limited the use of commercial and passenger vehicles in Beijing. From 20 June through 20 September, passenger vehicle restrictions were placed on alternate days depending on the terminal digit of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing's 3.3million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> demand created by these restrictions and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4million additional passengers per day.|$|E
5|$|In season eight, Lex {{is missing}} and Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freeman) {{is put in}} charge as Lex's {{hand-picked}} successor. Tess wants Lex found, until Lex is revealed to have a surgically-implanted nano-transmitter in Tess's optic nerve. Wanting revenge, Lex uses a kryptonite bomb to have Lana's stolen bio-enhanced suit, designed to absorb and emit kryptonite radiation, <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> radiation to de-activate the bomb and subsequently {{never be able to}} go near Clark again without fatal effects. Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley) discovers Lex's location and uses a bomb to blow up Lex's travelling medical transport, seemingly killing him.|$|E

In the case of radioactive substances with placental transfer, <b>the</b> <b>absorbed</b> dose to organs and tissues of the mother may, as a first approximation, be taken as representative of <b>the</b> <b>absorbed</b> dose to <b>the</b> corresponding organs and tissues of the fetus [51].|$|R
50|$|Following {{the defeat}} of Italian colonial {{authority}} in 1941, Amhara Sayint, Lasta, Raya, Wag and Yejju were annexed to Wollo. Peasant rebellions rocked the province, which included the Woyane rebellion in 1943, and revolts of the Yejju in 1948 and 1970. With {{the adoption of the}} new constitution in 1995, Wollo was divided between the Afar Region, which <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> part of the province that extended into the Afar Depression; the Tigray Region, which <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> northwestern corner; and the Amhara Region, which <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the province in the Ethiopian Highlands.|$|R
5|$|Most {{stations}} are sited {{within a few}} kilometres of a suitable grid connection point. This network needs {{to be capable of}} absorbing the output of the solar park when operating at its maximum capacity. The project developer will normally have to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> cost of providing power lines to this point and making the connection; in addition often to any costs associated with upgrading the grid, so it can accommodate the output from the plant.|$|E
5|$|NuScale's design {{does not}} rely on powered water pumps or circulatory equipment. The company claims it can shut down and {{continue}} cooling itself indefinitely {{in the event of}} a catastrophe. The devices are intended to be kept in a below-ground pool, to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> shock of earthquakes, with a concrete lid over the pool. In the event that AC power is lost for normal cooling systems, the pool water begins to absorb heat and boil.|$|E
5|$|The Ecological {{footprint}} measures {{human consumption}} {{in terms of}} the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources, and <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> wastes of the average global citizen. In 2008 it required 2.7 global hectares per person, 30% more than the natural biological capacity of 2.1 global hectares (assuming no provision for other organisms). The resulting ecological deficit must be met from unsustainable extra sources and these are obtained in three ways: embedded in the goods and services of world trade; taken from the past (e.g. fossil fuels); or borrowed from the future as unsustainable resource usage (e.g. by over exploiting forests and fisheries).|$|E
