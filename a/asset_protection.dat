As of December 1998, the government had licensed 418 banks and trust companies in The Bahamas. The Bahamas promulgated the International Business Companies (IBC) Act in January 1990 to enhance the country's status as a leading financial center. The act served to simplify and {{reduce the cost of}} incorporating offshore companies in The Bahamas. Within 9 years, more than 84,000 IBC-type companies had been established. In February 1991, the government also legalized the establishment of <b>Asset</b> <b>Protection</b> Trusts in The Bahamas.

2500|$|In the USA, a {{protective}} trust {{is a type}} of trust that was devised for use in estate planning. (In another jurisdiction this might be thought of as one type of <b>asset</b> <b>protection</b> trust.) Often a person, A, wishes to leave property to another person B. A, however, [...] fears that the property might be claimed by creditors before A dies, and that therefore B would receive none of it. A could establish a trust with B as the beneficiary, but then A would not be entitled to use of the property before they died. Protective trusts were developed as a solution to this situation. A would establish a trust with both A and B as beneficiaries, with the trustee instructed to allow A use of the property until they died, and thereafter to allow its use to B. The property is then safe from being claimed by As creditors, at least so long as the debt was entered into after the trust's establishment. This use of trusts is similar to life estates and remainders, and is frequently used as an alternative to them.|$|E
