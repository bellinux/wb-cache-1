We address three particular research questions associated with this general objective: RQ 1.

30|$|Next, we {{investigated}} if {{the observation of}} <b>agglomerations</b> in the source code can help to indicate the presence of architectural problems. To this end, we compared the upstream relationship of code-anomaly <b>agglomerations</b> and individual code anomalies to architectural problems. The Upstream AG (<b>agglomerations)</b> and CA (individual code anomalies) columns of Table 4 show that <b>agglomerations</b> presented even better results from this perspective. With the exception of OODT, the proportion of <b>agglomerations</b> related to architectural problems was {{at least twice as}} large as the proportion of individual code anomalies. Moreover, for five systems (HW, S 1, S 2, S 3 and S 4), the proportion of single code anomalies related to architectural problems was lower than 25 %. These results further reinforce the potential of exploring code-anomaly <b>agglomerations</b> as indicators of architectural problems.|$|R
30|$|Where {{to start}} from? As {{discussed}} in the previous section, the participants identified few more true positives using <b>agglomerations.</b> Someone could expect that all developers using <b>agglomerations</b> would significantly outperform the control group. However, we observed that participants spent much more time analyzing the <b>agglomerations</b> than analyzing the smells in the control group. That happened because they analyzed each code smell in the stinky program location as previously explained in the “Do <b>agglomerations</b> improve precision?” section. Furthermore, sometimes the participants analyzed <b>agglomerations</b> that were not related to any design problem, which is a key factor that explains the almost same number of true positives between both groups.|$|R
30|$|Our first {{research}} question aims {{to investigate the}} precision of developers {{in the identification of}} design problems with <b>agglomerations.</b> Answer for such question will indicate whether developers benefit or not of using <b>agglomerations.</b> However, answering this questions is not enough for revealing the reasons why <b>agglomerations</b> may benefit developers. Moreover, we will not know how to improve the use of <b>agglomerations</b> to identify design problems. Therefore, we conducted a qualitative analysis to investigate what should be improved from the perspective of professional software developers. Besides identifying possible improvements, this analysis also helped us to understand what are the main strengths of exploring <b>agglomerations</b> for design problem identification.|$|R

30|$|The two {{analyses}} above {{provide evidence}} that <b>agglomerations</b> are more helpful than individual code anomalies to diagnose architectural problems.

Thus, this issue also helps us to explain why they fell short in identifying additional design problems through the analysis of <b>agglomerations.</b>|$|R

30|$|In {{this section}} we {{highlighted}} several {{situations in which}} code anomaly <b>agglomerations</b> are useful to diagnose architectural problems. One of the given examples showed that some architectural problems are difficult to diagnose due to being spread through diverse unrelated modules.

On the other hand, other <b>agglomerations</b> {{may be useful in}} other situations.

30|$|In {{order to}} answer {{research}} question RQ 1, we performed both downstream and upstream analyses {{in all the}} seven systems.

Conversely, in the upstream analysis we analyzed how <b>agglomerations</b> and individual code anomalies are related to architectural problems. Furthermore, to answer research question RQ 2, we analyzed the relation between architectural problems and <b>agglomerations.</b> To measure the extension of this relation, we conducted two complementary analyses. First, we calculated the average of anomalous elements, which take part in individual <b>agglomerations</b> and directly contribute to an architectural problem. Second, we analyzed the proportion of anomalous elements related to architectural problems and taking part in one or more <b>agglomerations.</b> To answer RQ 3 we compared the number of <b>agglomerations</b> related to architectural problems in each topology. Finally, to illustrate our findings, we selected insightful examples from our target systems.|$|R

5|$|Ash fallout occurs {{immediately}} after the eruption and is controlled by particle density. Initially, coarse particles fall out close to source. This is followed by fallout of accretionary lapilli, {{which is the result}} of particle <b>agglomeration</b> within the column. Ash fallout is less concentrated during the final stages as the column moves downwind. This results in an ash fall deposit which generally decreases in thickness and grain size exponentially with increasing distance from the volcano. Fine ash particles may remain in the atmosphere for days to weeks and be dispersed by high-altitude winds. These particles can impact on the aviation industry (refer to impacts section) and, combined with gas particles, can affect global climate.|$|E
