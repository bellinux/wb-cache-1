5|$|According to {{annual average}} daily traffic counts {{compiled}} in 2011 by NYSDOT, the most-traveled stretch of the Sagtikos State Parkway was the portion between the Southern State Parkway <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Island Expressway. The part between the Southern State and Pine Aire Drive handled an average of 87,250 vehicles per day; slightly lower numbers were recorded along the segment between Pine Aire Drive <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Island Expressway, with roughly 85,300 vehicles using the section on a daily basis. The portion between the Long Island Expressway and the Northern State Parkway carries an average of 67,600 vehicles per day. All three segments saw a rise in traffic {{over the course of}} the previous decade, with the Pine Aire Drive–Long Island Expressway segment gaining 14,000 vehicles per day during that time.|$|E
5|$|In the 1820s, {{the park}} was {{extensively}} redesigned by Decimus Burton.

5|$|By February 1918, {{the crews}} of Sankt Georg {{and several other}} {{warships}} grew weary of the war <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> periods of inactivity, {{which led to the}} Cattaro Mutiny. The mutiny was quickly suppressed, but Sankt Georg and several other ships were subsequently decommissioned. Under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Sankt Georg was awarded as a war prize to Britain. In 1920, she was sold to Italian ship breakers and scrapped thereafter.|$|E

5|$|By the 1940s it was {{recognized}} that this arrangement was unsatisfactory. The American Medical Association conducted {{a series of}} studies in 1948, followed by a Department of the Interior study in 1950. They highlighted the deficiencies of the program: commitment procedures in Alaska were archaic, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> trip to Portland had a negative effect on patients and their families. In addition, an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which owned the hospital, had been padding its expenses. This had enabled it to make an excess profit of $69,000 per year (equivalent to over $588,000 per year at 2007 prices).|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{activity}} in the Quantocks from prehistoric times includes finds of Mesolithic flints at North Petherton and Broomfield and many Bronze Age round barrows (marked on maps as tumulus, plural tumuli), such as Thorncombe Barrow above Bicknoller. Several ancient stones can be seen, such as the Triscombe Stone <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Stone above Holford. Many of the tracks along ridges of the Quantocks probably originated as ancient ridgeways. A Bronze Age hill fort, Norton Camp, was built to the south at Norton Fitzwarren, close to the centre of bronze making in Taunton.|$|E

In 2006, Bradley filed for divorce but the petition was never finalized.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its scientific results, Hubble has also {{made significant contributions to}} aerospace engineering, in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit. These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth where they can be studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior of graphite composite structures in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing, radiation damage to electronics and sensors, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> term behavior of multi-layer insulation. One lesson learned was that gyros assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion. Gyros are now assembled using pressurized nitrogen.|$|E

5|$|Lee's army now dug {{in around}} Petersburg, Virginia <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> Siege of Petersburg {{commenced}} with several frontal assaults on the Confederate position. The 22nd {{took part in}} the assault on June 18, 1864. Again the regiment was deployed as skirmishers in front of their brigade. They were ordered to take a ravine alongside the Norfolk Railroad. Advancing at a run in the face of heavy canister fire, the 22nd reached the ravine. However, in that position they were subjected to severe musket and artillery fire from the Confederates, and so they pushed forward to the Norfolk Railroad cut, forcing the Confederates back to their entrenchments. In the assault on Petersburg, the 22nd lost seven killed and 14 wounded.|$|E
5|$|New York City {{was struck}} {{particularly}} {{hard by the}} storm. It is estimated that 42 people perished, and several hundred more people were injured. The storm disrupted the city for days, and forced schools to close. Streets throughout Queens became impassable; mail service, buses, taxis, delivery vehicles, and trash collection were all disrupted. Thousands of motorists became trapped on the New York State Thruway. A snow emergency was issued in the city, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Island Rail Road suspended all service at the time. The snowstorm left approximately 6,000 travelers stranded at Kennedy Airport. They slept on chairs and floors. Over 1,000 vehicles were stalled or abandoned on the Tappan Zee Bridge; most of these were removed within a day.|$|E
5|$|One {{result was}} a flourishing of Scottish Renaissance painted {{ceilings}} and walls in estate houses. These included detailed coloured patterns and scenes, of which over a hundred examples survive. The designs relied upon continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism, as well as elements that called on heraldry, piety, classical myths and allegory. The earliest example still extant is at the Hamilton palace of Kinneil, West Lothian, decorated in the 1550s for the then regent the James Hamilton, Earl of Arran. Other examples include the ceiling at Prestongrange House, undertaken in 1581 for Mark Kerr, Commendator of Newbattle, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> gallery at Pinkie House, painted for Alexander Seaton, Earl of Dunfermline in 1621.|$|E
