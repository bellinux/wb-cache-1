5|$|The antibody's {{paratope}} {{interacts with}} the antigen's epitope. An <b>antigen</b> usually contains different epitopes along its surface arranged discontinuously, and dominant epitopes on a given <b>antigen</b> are called determinants.|$|E
5|$|A B cell {{identifies}} pathogens when antibodies on {{its surface}} bind to a specific foreign <b>antigen.</b> This antigen/antibody complex is {{taken up by the}} B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides. The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides {{on its surface}} MHC class II molecules. This combination of MHC and <b>antigen</b> attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell. As the activated B cell then begins to divide, its offspring (plasma cells) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this <b>antigen.</b> These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph, bind to pathogens expressing the <b>antigen</b> and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.|$|E
5|$|Antibody and <b>antigen</b> {{interact}} by spatial complementarity (lock and key). The molecular forces {{involved in}} the Fab-epitope interaction are weak and non-specific – for example electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces. This means binding between antibody and <b>antigen</b> is reversible, and the antibody's affinity towards an <b>antigen</b> is relative rather than absolute. Relatively weak binding also means {{it is possible for}} an antibody to cross-react with different antigens of different relative affinities.|$|E
50|$|Tumor <b>antigens</b> {{are those}} <b>antigens</b> that are {{presented}} by MHC class I or MHC class II molecules {{on the surface}} of tumor cells. <b>Antigens</b> found only on such cells are called tumor-specific <b>antigens</b> (TSAs) and generally result from a tumor-specific mutation. More common are <b>antigens</b> that are presented by tumor cells and normal cells, called tumor-associated <b>antigens</b> (TAAs). Cytotoxic T lymphocytes that recognize these <b>antigens</b> may be able to destroy tumor cells.|$|R
40|$|TL (thymus-leukaemia) <b>antigens</b> are {{specified}} by the TLa locus, which is closely linked to H- 2, the locus responsible for the major transplantation <b>antigens</b> of the mouse. Unlike other non-H- 2 <b>antigens</b> tested for, TL <b>antigens</b> did not separate from H- 2 <b>antigens</b> {{through a series of}} purification steps. On DEAE ion exchange chromatography, however, certain H- 2 <b>antigens</b> tested for were separated from one another, and TL <b>antigens</b> occupied a different position between them. Thus the properties of TL <b>antigens</b> that appear by gene activation consequent upon leukaemogenesis in TL negative mice are not distinguishable from the properties of TL <b>antigens</b> occurring as a normal feature of TL positive mice...|$|R

The molecular definition of these <b>antigens</b> is progressing at an accelerated pace. The currently characterised melanoma <b>antigens</b> can be classified into three categories: differentiation <b>antigens,</b> <b>antigens</b> encoded by genes that are specifically expressed in tumours, and <b>antigens</b> encoded by mutated genes.

40|$|Five new {{histocompatibility}} <b>antigens,</b> designated secondary B cell or (SB) <b>antigens,</b> {{have been}} identified by secondary allogeneic proliferative and cytotoxic responses. The reagents used to define the SB antigents are lymphocytes primed between donors matched for all known HLA <b>antigens.</b> The SB <b>antigens</b> stimulate weak primary allogeneic proliferative responses (a mean relative response of 8 %) but strong secondary proliferative responses. Strong secondary cell-mediated cytotoxicity is generated against target <b>antigens</b> that are distinguishable from the SB <b>antigens</b> defined by proliferation. Studies by direct lysis and by cold-target inhibition indicate that these target <b>antigens</b> are preferentially expressed on B cells relative to T cells. The SB <b>antigens</b> segregate with HLA, and the gene(s) encoding the SB 1, 3, and 4 <b>antigens</b> maps centromeric to HLA-B. The SB <b>antigens</b> are major histocompatibility <b>antigens</b> {{not only because they}} are encoded by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, but also by the functional criteria that the proliferative and cytotoxic responses to SB <b>antigens</b> are not restricted by HLA-DR or HLA-A,-B. Parallel studies of the SB <b>antigens</b> and the DR <b>antigens</b> with respect to: (a) their preferential expression on B cells, (b) their function in secondary allogeneic proliferative and cytotoxic respones, and (c) the location of their structural gene within the MHC. However, the SB <b>antigens</b> and the DR <b>antigens</b> are clearly distinct <b>antigens,</b> because population studies indicate that they can occur independently, and family studies indicate that specific SB <b>antigens</b> segregate with HLA haplotypes having different D and DR specificities. Our data are consistent with the hypotheses that the SB <b>antigens</b> are a new segregant series of B cell alloantigens, and that the SB gene and the DR gene derive from a duplicated ancestral gene...|$|R
40|$|A {{cooperative}} {{interaction between}} thymus-derived (T) helper cells "(THP and antibody-producing (B) cells {{is required for}} an optimal antibody response to most <b>antigens,</b> i. e. T-dependent (TD) <b>antigens.</b> (1). By contrast, another group of <b>antigens,</b> the so-called T-independent (TI) <b>antigens,</b> apparently does not require TH to optimally activate B cells (1, 2). However antibody responses induced by TI <b>antigens</b> differ markedly from those induced by TD <b>antigens.</b> In particular, most TI <b>antigens</b> elicit antibody which is solely or primarily of the IgM class (1 - 5) and multiple injections of TI <b>antigens</b> do not elicit IgG memory responses (1, 2, 6 - 8). The general inability of TI <b>antigens</b> to induce memory in IgG-producing B cells (By) has several possible explanations. For example, the population of B cells which responds to TI <b>antigens</b> (9) may be inherently incapable of undergoing differentiation to memory By cells. This {{may be due to}} the fact that TI <b>antigens</b> do not activate Tn which might be required for such differentiation to occur (10 - 12) or because TI <b>antigens</b> preferentially activate suppressor T cell...|$|R

5|$|Often, once an {{antibody}} and <b>antigen</b> bind, {{they become}} an immune complex, which {{functions as a}} unitary object and can act as an <b>antigen</b> in its own right, being countered by other antibodies. Similarly, haptens are small molecules that provoke no immune response by themselves, but once they bind to proteins, the resulting complex or hapten-carrier adduct is antigenic.|$|E

5|$|About 10,000 years ago, malaria {{started having}} {{a major impact}} on human survival, coinciding with the start of {{agriculture}} in the Neolithic revolution. Consequences included natural selection for sickle-cell disease, thalassaemias, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, Southeast Asian ovalocytosis, elliptocytosis and loss of the Gerbich <b>antigen</b> (glycophorin C) and the Duffy <b>antigen</b> on the erythrocytes, because such blood disorders confer a selective advantage against malaria infection (balancing selection).

40|$|Precipitating <b>antigens</b> from Theileria parva {{have been}} {{partially}} purified.

The <b>antigens</b> showed considerable molecular heterogeneity, almost certainly a result of the preparative method, and they always contained large amounts of DNA. The piroplasm <b>antigens</b> were of parasite nuclear origin and the schizont <b>antigens</b> were probably of the same origin.

40|$|Envelope, capsid, and soluble <b>antigens</b> of Herpesvirus hominis (HVH) types 1 and 2 were {{compared}} to crude <b>antigens</b> (disrupted HVH-infected cells) for potency, type-specificity, and diagnostic value in the indirect hemagglutination (IHA) test. The envelope {{appeared to be the}} predominant component reacting in the IHA test, but recurrent HVH infections increased the reactivity of human sera with capsid <b>antigens.</b> The soluble <b>antigens</b> reacted in the IHA test with HVH immune animal sera, but very few convalescent-phase human sera showed reactivity with soluble <b>antigens.</b> Overall, none of the subunit <b>antigens</b> showed greater type-specificity than did crude <b>antigens</b> in IHA tests with immune animal or convalescent-phase human sera. Recurrent infections with type 1 or type 2 viruses tended to broaden heterotypic reactivity of the patients' sera with both crude and subunit <b>antigens,</b> even in patients showing only a single type of antibody by IHA inhibition.

5|$|After the {{processed}} <b>antigen</b> (peptide) is complexed to the MHC molecule, {{they both}} migrate together {{to the cell}} membrane, where they are exhibited (elaborated) as a complex that can be recognized by the CD 4+ (T helper cell)– a type of white blood cell. This is known as <b>antigen</b> presentation.

5|$|Isotype {{or class}} {{switching}} is a biological process occurring after {{activation of the}} B cell, which allows the cell to produce different classes of antibody (IgA, IgE, or IgG). The different classes of antibody, and thus effector functions, are defined by the constant (C) regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. Initially, naive B cells express only cell-surface IgM and IgD with identical <b>antigen</b> binding regions. Each isotype is adapted for a distinct function; therefore, after activation, an antibody with an IgG, IgA, or IgE effector function might be required to effectively eliminate an <b>antigen.</b> Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes. Only the constant region of the antibody heavy chain changes during class switching; the variable regions, and therefore <b>antigen</b> specificity, remain unchanged. Thus the progeny of a single B cell can produce antibodies, all specific for the same <b>antigen,</b> but {{with the ability to}} produce the effector function appropriate for each antigenic challenge. Class switching is triggered by cytokines; the isotype generated depends on which cytokines are present in the B cell environment.|$|E

CA19-9 (carbohydrate <b>antigen</b> 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, not least because 5% of people lack the Lewis (a) <b>antigen</b> and cannot produce CA19-9.
