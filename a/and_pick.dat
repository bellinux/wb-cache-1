Himesh picked Joyeeta, Aadesh <b>picked</b> Hemabindu, <b>and</b> Jatin-Lalit were last <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> Sanchali. In the Shishya Round, Himani was drawn first <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> Aadesh.

5|$|During the night, the {{electrical}} power suddenly turned {{off and the}} radios went silent. Just before 11:30pm, a huge stream of water swept through Armero; it was powerful enough to flip cars <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> up people. A loud roar could be heard from the mountain, but the residents were panicked over what they {{believed to be a}} flood.|$|E
5|$|On June 16, 1987, Jacobson {{received}} a card in his mail {{telling him to}} go to the post office <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> up the envelope that supposedly contained Boys Who Love Boys. Comfort observed him doing so and got a search warrant for his home on that basis. He was arrested shortly thereafter, 26 months after the postal inspectors had first contacted him.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening of}} {{extensions}} of the Piccadilly line to Uxbridge, Hounslow and Cockfosters followed in 1933. On the Metropolitan Railway, Ashfield <b>and</b> <b>Pick</b> instigated a rationalisation of services. The barely used and loss-making Brill and Verney Junction branches beyond Aylesbury were closed in 1935 and 1936. Freight services were reduced and electrification of the remaining steam operated sections of the line was planned. In 1935, the availability of government-backed loans to stimulate the flagging economy allowed Ashfield <b>and</b> <b>Pick</b> to promote system-wide improvements under the New Works Programme for 1935–1940, including {{the transfer of the}} Metropolitan line's Stanmore services to the Bakerloo line in 1939, the Northern line's Northern Heights project and extension of the Central line to Ongar and Denham.|$|E
5|$|After {{two years}} as a farmer, Jansch left his wife and family and {{returned}} to music, although Jansch and his wife would not be formally divorced until 1988. In 1977, he recorded the album A Rare Conundrum with {{a new set of}} musicians: Mike Piggott, Rod Clements <b>and</b> <b>Pick</b> Withers. He then formed the band Conundrum with the addition of Martin Jenkins (violin) and Nigel Smith (bass). They spent six months touring Australia, Japan and the United States. With the end of the tour, Conundrum parted company and Jansch spent six months in the United States, where he recorded the Heartbreak album with Albert Lee.|$|E
5|$|As the February 29 trade {{deadline}} approached, Reimer's {{future with}} the rebuilding Maple Leafs became uncertain. On February 27, 2016, {{two days before}} the deadline, Reimer was traded to the San Jose Sharks, alongside Jeremy Morin, in exchange for Alex Stalock, Ben Smith and a conditional fourth round pick in the 2018 draft (condition dependent on the Sharks reaching the Stanley Cup Finals; condition met <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> was converted to a third round pick on May 25, 2016).|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} time in Webber's career the first race of the season was not held in Melbourne, but in Bahrain, due to the {{original}} date clashing with the Commonwealth Games. Webber qualified 7th and had a solid race to finish 6th <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> up 3 Championship points. Although Webber was considered by some to have the better race performance, this was generally overlooked when Rosberg set the fastest lap in his debut race and moved up through the field despite a first-lap incident.|$|E
5|$|In series 2, {{the format}} {{consists}} of six rounds with eight contestants. This time, {{they do not}} have to choose their colour prior to the start of a round and can hold their nerve. In each of the first three rounds, the eight contestants watch a series of stunts, sporting challenges or performances. They'll then use their judgement to predict the outcome or have their powers of observation tested. Either way, the contestants must strike their buzzer <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> either red or black.|$|E
5|$|Like other primates, lemurs groom {{socially}} (allogroom) to ease {{tensions and}} solidify relationships. They groom in greeting, when waking up, when settling in for sleep, {{between mother and}} infant, in juvenile relations, and for sexual advances. Unlike anthropoid primates, who part the fur with the hands <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> out particles with the fingers or mouth, lemurs groom with their tongue and scraping with their toothcomb. Despite the differences in technique, lemurs groom with the same frequency and {{for the same reasons}} as anthropoids.|$|E

5|$|Lynette is {{frustrated}} with Nora inviting herself to family events. To ensure that Nora {{does not show}} up to Parker's (Zane Huett) birthday party, Tom and Lynette tell her that they are having Kayla over for a quiet afternoon. Nora becomes suspicious and arrives at the party unannounced. She is furious over their deception and threatens to take Kayla home, but Tom tries to calm her by inviting Nora to stay. Lynette accuses Tom of putting Nora and Kayla ahead {{of the rest of}} the family, which encourages Tom to ask Nora to leave <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> up Kayla later. Eventually, Nora obliges.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{was inaugurated}} as Governor of Indiana on January 11, 1909. Since his party {{had been out}} of power for many years, its initial {{objective}} was to appoint as many Democrats as possible to patronage positions. Marshall tried to avoid becoming directly involved in the patronage system. He allowed the party's different factions to have positions and appointed very few of his own choices. He allowed Taggart to manage the process <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> the candidates, but signed off himself on the official appointments. Although his position on patronage kept peace in his party, it prevented him from building a strong political base.|$|E
5|$|The chaotic {{nature of}} the atmosphere, the massive {{computational}} power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the range of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus helps to narrow the error <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> the most likely outcome.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving employs {{non-linear}} storytelling, {{forcing the}} player {{to piece together}} the narrative. During gameplay, objectives and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects. The player has little control over the game mechanics and is only able to move freely <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> up objects as needed to progress. Several optional actions, such as drinking alcohol, are available at several stages of the game.|$|E
5|$|A complete, consistent, hardworking and {{versatile}} midfielder, Alonso {{is regarded as}} one of the best players of his generation, and is effective both creatively and defensively. Gifted with good technique, excellent vision, and varied passing range, he excels in the centre in a deep-lying playmaking role, where he can best use his accurate long passing ability to create goal scoring chances for teammates; he also possesses a powerful and accurate shot from distance, and he is an effective set-piece and penalty kick taker. Due to his height, positioning, and physical characteristics, Xabi Alonso is also effective in the air, often contributing with headed goals from set pieces when advancing into more offensive positions. In addition to his creative attributes, he is also capable of excelling as a defensive midfielder due to his strength and powerful physique, combined with his tenacity, tactical intelligence, aggressive tackling and his ability to read the game. He has at times been criticised, however, for occasionally committing rash challenges and for his tendency to lose his composure <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> up unnecessary cards for particularly hard fouls.|$|E
5|$|As a point-and-click {{adventure}} game, {{the player}} controls Simon using the mouse. The iOS and Android versions feature touch-screen controls. Gameplay involves moving Simon around and interacting with objects and other characters. The player can make Simon perform actions such as giving an item to another character, talk to another character, <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> up (add to inventory), examine, use, move, consume, wear, or open or close an item. Some actions are binary: they involve two objects and the player sometimes, after telling Simon {{to use an}} item, needs to specify what to use it with. A map that enables Simon to instantly transport to a major landmark (if it has been discovered) is provided. The postcard is used to load, save, or quit the game.|$|E

50|$|Pushpadanta was so awestruck by {{the beauty}} of the garden, that he could not control his {{emotions}} <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> up the flowers from the garden. Every day he tried to stop himself, but failed <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> up the flowers. As a result, King Chitraratha was left with no flowers to complete his prayers to Lord Shiva.|$|R
5|$|During the {{recording}} of World Painted Blood, King used BC Rich Guitars, Marshall Amplifiers and Cabs, Dunlop strings <b>and</b> <b>picks,</b> EMG pickups, <b>and</b> Korg tuners. Hanneman used ESP guitars, Marshall Amplifiers and Cabs, Dunlop strings <b>and</b> <b>picks,</b> Monster Cables, <b>and</b> Shure Wireless System. Vocalist/bassist Araya used ESP basses, Marshall Bass Amplifiers and Cabs, EMG Pick-Ups, Dunlop <b>Picks</b> <b>and</b> accessories, and MXR Effects. Lombardo used Tama Drums, Paiste cymbals, Pro-Mark drum sticks, and Evans drum heads.|$|R
