25|$|For we {{all agree}} that the most {{excellent}} man should rule, i.e., the supreme by nature, and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law is a kind of intelligence, i.e. a discourse based on intelligence. And <b>again,</b> <b>what</b> standard do we have, what criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), {{it is clear that the}} intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it's evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and <b>again,</b> <b>what</b> could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

500|$|Misterioso was {{released}} in 1958 by Riverside and was Monk's eighth album for the label. Writing for Hi Fi Review, critic Nat Hentoff said the record was [...] "not one of his best" [...] and observed [...] "too little space for Monk's soloing and somewhat too much" [...] for Griffin, whose saxophone cry and timing were more impressive than his solos. Hentoff also believed Haynes and Abdul-Malik did not support Monk as creatively as Wilbur Ware and Art Blakey had on his previous Riverside albums, where he said Monk was in more compelling form. In 1959, Monk was voted the pianist {{of the year in}} an annual poll of international jazz critics from Down Beat magazine, who said he was heard [...] "at his challenging, consistently creative best" [...] on Misterioso. When Misterioso {{was released}} in 1964 in the United Kingdom, Charles Fox gave it a positive review in Gramophone. He found its music on-par with Monk's usual standards and highlighted by exceptional playing by him and the rhythm section, particularly Haynes, who showed [...] "once <b>again</b> <b>what</b> a great drummer he was then—and, indeed, still is today". However, Fox felt Griffin did not fit in with the quartet and overshadowed Monk's compositions, finding his solos diffuse and characterized by trivial quotations rather than musical development.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Conan sidekick Andy Richter {{left the}} show, and Weinberg became the [...] "second banana". Weinberg {{continued}} {{to present an}} obvious visual foil: as O'Brien said, [...] "If you looked at this guy you would never know he was the drummer in a huge rock 'n' roll band. You would say {{he was the guy}} who did the band's accounting. But Max is the authoritative, buttoned-down adult {{in the midst of all}} this madness." [...] The drummer reveled in O'Brien's youthful audience: [...] "To be 49 and appreciated by 14-year-olds <b>again?</b> <b>What</b> a thrill!" [...] Weinberg engaged in stare-downs with O'Brien and gave scripted screeds about newsmakers. [...] Additionally, Weinberg was comically presented as a twisted character with sexual fetishes and homicidal tendencies in comedy bits. When Conan O'Brien was host of Saturday Night Live on March 10, 2001, his monologue featured a visit from the SNL studio to the Late Night studio (only a few floors apart in the same building, 30 Rockefeller Plaza), where Conan discovers Weinberg engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman on his desk (played by Max's real-life wife, Becky). [...] Weinberg says of his comic persona: [...] "t's playing against type. I've been happily married for nearly 30 years, with two wonderful children. It's not what I portray on the show, and that's funny." [...] Weinberg continued his one-man college shows, now titled [...] "E Street to Late Night: Dreams Found, Lost, and Found Again".|$|E

500|$|It is {{believed}} that Shankly wanted {{a seat on the}} Liverpool board, following the precedent of Matt Busby who joined the Manchester United board after he retired as manager in 1969. But, <b>again,</b> <b>what</b> Shankly did not understand was that his relations with the board had often been acrimonious with several resignation threats and a statement made by Shankly that: [...] "At a football club, there's a holy trinity – the players, the manager and the supporters. Directors don't come into it. They are only there to sign the cheques". Although some club officials like secretary Peter Robinson wanted bygones to be bygones, Tommy Smith summarised the board's view as [...] "Right, that's it, we've got rid of him at last". It should be remembered that Shankly was [...] "an overpowering figure" [...] who would certainly have used a position on the board to be a [...] "back-seat driver" [...] and the board were well aware that Matt Busby's time as a Manchester United director was disastrous, the team just having been relegated. Whilst Liverpool's treatment of Shankly may have seemed disrespectful, they were acting {{in the best interests of}} the club and its new manager by pursuing the same relentless winning ethic that Shankly himself had instilled. In any event, their perceived ruthlessness was vindicated by the unprecedented haul of League Championship titles and European Cups won over the next decade under Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Colonel Smith, {{concerned}} {{about the safety of}} his men, sent flankers to follow a ridge and protect his forces from the roughly 1,000 colonials now in the field as the British marched east out of Concord. This ridge ended near Meriam's Corner, a crossroads about a mile (2km) outside the village of Concord, where the main road came to a bridge across a small stream. To cross the narrow bridge, the British had to pull the flankers back into the main column and close ranks to a mere three soldiers abreast. [...] Colonial militia companies arriving from the north and east had converged at this point, and presented a clear numerical advantage over the regulars. The British were now witnessing once <b>again</b> <b>what</b> General Gage had hoped to avoid by dispatching the expedition in secrecy and in the dark of night: the ability of the colonial militiamen to rise and converge by the thousands when British forces ventured out of Boston. [...] As the last of the British column marched over the narrow bridge, the British rear guard wheeled and fired a volley at the colonial militiamen, who had been firing irregularly and ineffectively from a distance but now had closed to within musket range. [...] The colonists returned fire, this time with deadly effect. Two regulars were killed and perhaps six wounded, with no colonial casualties. Smith sent out his flanking troops again after crossing the small bridge.|$|E
500|$|Writers {{agree that}} the episode was risky and could have failed spectacularly. Jonathan Bernstein in the British {{newspaper}} The Observer writes [...] "What could have been, at best, an eccentric diversion and, at worst, a shuddering embarrassment, succeeded on every level It provided a startling demonstration that creator Joss Whedon has a facility with lyrics and melody equal to the one he's demonstrated {{for the past six}} seasons with dialogue, character and plot twists. Rather than adopt the 'Hey, wouldn't it be wacky if we suddenly burst into song?' approach practised by Ally McBeal, the Buffy musical was entirely organic to the series' labyrinthine progression." [...] Johnston in the Sunday Herald Sun says, [...] "There is just so much to this marvellously cheeky episode that suggests the show can take any route it pleases and pull it off", while Debi Enker in The Age comments, [...] "Whedon demonstrates yet <b>again</b> <b>what</b> Buffy aficionados have known and appreciated for years: that his wit, playfulness and readiness to take a risk make his television efforts rise way above the pack." [...] Steve Murray in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution characterizes the episode as [...] "scary in a brand-new way", saying [...] "Once More, with Feeling" [...] is [...] "as impressive as Whedon's milestone episodes 'Hush' and 'The Body; the episode is [...] "often hilarious", according to Murray, and acts as [...] "(b)oth spoof and homage, [...] the hokiness of musicals while also capturing the guilty pleasure and surges of feeling the genre inspires".|$|E

2500|$|Martin Heidegger {{rejected}} the philosophical {{basis of the}} concepts of [...] "subjectivity" [...] and [...] "objectivity" [...] and asserted that similar grounding oppositions in logic ultimately refer to one another. Instead of resisting the admission of this paradox {{in the search for}} understanding, Heidegger requires that we embrace it through an active process of elucidation he called the [...] "hermeneutic circle". He stressed the historicity and cultural construction of concepts while simultaneously advocating the necessity of an [...] and immanent apprehension of them. In this vein, he asserted that it was the task of contemporary philosophy to recover the original question of (or [...] "openness to") Dasein (translated as Being or Being-there) present in the Presocratic philosophers but normalized, neutered, and standardized since Plato. This was to be done, in part, by tracing the record of Dasein's sublimation or forgetfulness through the history of philosophy which meant that we were to ask <b>again</b> <b>what</b> constituted the grounding conditions in ourselves and in the World for the affinity between beings and between the many usages of the term [...] "being" [...] in philosophy. To do this, however, a non-historical and, to a degree, self-referential engagement with whatever set of ideas, feelings or practices would permit (both the non-fixed concept and reality of) such a continuity was required—a continuity permitting the possible experience, possible existence indeed not only of beings but of all differences as they appeared and tended to develop.|$|E
