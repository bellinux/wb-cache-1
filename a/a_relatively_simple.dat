If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the malware (<b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>simple</b> process) before it has completed would stop further damage to data, without salvaging any already lost.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A uniform kernel {{estimator}} for {{intensity of}} a periodic Poisson process with unknowm period is presented and a proof of its consistency is discussed. The result {{presented in this}} paper is a special case of that in [3]. The aim of discussing a uniform kernel estimator is {{in order to be able}} to present <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>simpler</b> proof of consistency compared to that in [3]. This is a joint work with R. Helmers and R. Zitikis...|$|R
5|$|After DNA {{replication}} is complete, {{the cell}} must physically {{separate the two}} copies of the genome and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells. In prokaryotes(bacteria and archaea) this usually occurs via <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>simple</b> process called binary fission, in which each circular genome attaches to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane invaginates to split the cytoplasm into two membrane-bound portions. Binary fission is extremely fast compared to the rates of cell division in eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cell division is a more complex process known as the cell cycle; DNA replication occurs during a phase of this cycle known as S phase, whereas the process of segregating chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm occurs during M phase.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} stages of World War II, the entire Cold War, {{and to a}} lesser extent afterwards, {{uranium-235}} has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>simple</b> device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb (thermonuclear weapon) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} {{example of}} a matrix model is the BFSS matrix model proposed by Tom Banks, Willy Fischler, Stephen Shenker, and Leonard Susskind in 1997. This theory describes {{the behavior of a}} set of nine large matrices. In their original paper, these authors showed, among other things, that the low energy limit of this matrix model is described by eleven-dimensional supergravity. These calculations led them to propose that the BFSS matrix model is exactly equivalent to M-theory. The BFSS matrix model can therefore be used as a prototype for a correct formulation of M-theory and a tool for investigating the properties of M-theory in <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>simple</b> setting.|$|E

30|$|<b>A</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>simpler</b> {{physical}} phenomenon constraint is the “physical device constraint” which arises {{within a}} component of a system. That is, it is a “local constraint.” Since it indicates the physical property of the component, each domain has its specific physical device constraints (for example, Ohm’s law constrains the values of current and voltage in an electric device). In contrast, there are “global constraints” which indicate the behavior of multiple components or the whole system. Global constraints are classified as follows.|$|R

5|$|The ice trade revolutionised the {{way that}} food was {{preserved}} and transported. Before the 19th century, preservation had depended upon techniques such as curing or smoking, but large supplies of natural ice allowed foods to be refrigerated or frozen instead. Although using ice to chill foods was <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>simple</b> process, it required considerable experimentation to produce efficient and reliable methods for controlling the flow of warm and cold air in different containers and transport systems. In {{the early stages of}} the ice trade there was also a tension between preserving the limited supply of ice, by limiting the flow of air over it, and preserving the food, which depended on circulating more air over the ice to create colder temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} atomic bombs were {{developed}} concurrently during the war: <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>simple</b> gun-type fission weapon {{and a more}} complex implosion-type nuclear weapon. The Thin Man gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium so a simpler gun-type called Little Boy was developed that used uranium-235, an isotope that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. Chemically identical to the most common isotope, uranium-238, and with almost the same mass, it proved difficult to separate the two. Three methods were employed for uranium enrichment: electromagnetic, gaseous and thermal. Most of this work was performed at the Clinton Engineer Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.|$|E

We find that the modular completion of P̅_ω(q) is not simply a harmonic Maass form, but is instead the derivative of a linear combination of products of various harmonic Maass forms and theta functions. We precisely describe its behavior under modular transformations and find that the image under the Maass lowering operator lies in <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>simpler</b> space...|$|R
5|$|The Ford Cosworth DFV was {{produced}} by Cosworth in Northampton and {{had been used in}} Formula One since 1967. It is a 2,993cc (183cu in) normally aspirated four-stroke engine with two banks of four cylinders at 90degrees to each other in a 'V8' configuration. It has an aluminium alloy engine block with cylinder liners. Each of its crossflow cylinder heads has a single spark plug and four valves, activated by gear-driven double overhead camshafts. This, combined with the flat-plane crankshaft, provides <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>simple</b> exhaust layout, in which the exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block. The engine is water-cooled, with water and oil radiators mounted in the left and right sidepods respectively.
