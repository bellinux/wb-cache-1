It is found that the orientation of the acoustic wave can {{have a significant impact on}} the receptivity process, with the maximum receptivity at a given sound-pressure level being produced by upstream oriented acoustic waves. At sufficiently low Mach numbers, the variation of receptivity with the acoustic-wave orientation can be predicted analytically and is the same for both surface suction and surface heating. However, as a result of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>refraction</b> across the mean boundary layer, the above dependence can become rather complex and, also, dependent on the type of surface nonuniformity.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{implementation of the}} standard Galerkin finite element method {{for the analysis of}} the acoustic and vortical modes in an axisymmetric lined duct carrying a high speed, subsonic, parallel mean shear flow. This is fundamentally theoretical work, but with a view to the specific engineering application of acoustic liner optimization in turbofan aero-engine ducts, as cylindrical and annular ducts are approximate models of inlet and bypass ducts, respectively. At high frequencies, the acoustic wavelength is comparable to the boundary layer thickness and this has an effect on <b>acoustic</b> <b>refraction</b> close to the duct walls. Preliminary results of this study reveal how different boundary layer profiles affect sound attenuation in a lined duct, compared with a uniform mean flow. The method solves the third-order eigenvalue problem for the pressure perturbation (Pridmore-Brown equation) with a locally reacting impedance boundary condition. The distinctive feature of this implementation is that it is fast and efficient.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of simultaneous multipoint measurements in the flowfield and acoustic field of a Mach 1. 75 cold-air jet is presented. A series of four optical-deflectometer probes measured turbulent fluctuations {{in or near the}} jet flow, and eight microphones recorded the far-field pressure in the direction of peak emission. The correlation methodology involves the coherence between the delay-and-sum beamformer outputs of the optical-deflectometer probes and the microphones. This procedure yields results with greater fidelity and higher coherence levels than obtained with individual optical-deflectometer-to-microphone correlations. With the optical-deflectometer probes in the jet shear layer, there is a significant correlation, on the order of 0. 1, between the turbulent fluctuations and farfield noise. As the optical-deflectometer probe moves transversely away from the jet, its correlation with the microphone beamformer first drops and then increases. This trend signifies the transition from hydrodynamic to acoustic pressure fields. In the vicinity of the nozzle exit, the peak coherence between the beamformed opticaldeflectometer and microphone signals coincides with the physical location of the optical-deflectometer probe. However, as the shear layer thickens downstream, the peak coherence generally lags the probe location, which is a probable result of <b>acoustic</b> <b>refraction</b> by the mean flow.

A field experiment was carried out in the Columbia River Estuary to test the hypothesis: the estuarine salt wedge is acoustically observable in terms of low-to-mid-frequency acoustic propagation. Linear frequencymodulated acoustic signals in the 500 – 2000 Hz band were transmitted during the advance and retreat of the salt wedge during May 27 – 29, 2013. Results demonstrate that the salt wedge front is the dominant physical mechanism controlling acoustic propagation in this environment: received signal energy is relatively stable before and after the passage of the salt wedge front when the acoustic path consists of a single medium (either entirely fresh water or entirely salt water), and suffers a 10 – 15 dB loss and increased variability during salt wedge front passage.

Many processes are inuenced by ocean density structure, including geostrophic flow, heat transfer, <b>acoustics,</b> light <b>refraction,</b> the timing of phytoplankton blooms, nutrient pumping, water column mixing, and stability. In the ocean, density changes due to heat flux, wind mixing, and fresh water input. Biological responses such as phytoplankton abundance respond quickly to changes in density structure, although in non-conservative ways, because mixing often induces phytoplankton growth. Many of the environmental conditions that either drive (e. g., wind) or are driven by (e. g., phytoplankton) density are observable from remote sensing platforms. Therefore, the relationships between environmental conditions and density structure {{make it possible to}} use satellite observations to systematically predict subsurface density structure. In this study, I compiled over 300, 000 density profiles from the Argo program, used nonlinear regression techniques to reduce them to five numeric parameters, and matched them with MODIS-Aqua sea surface temperature, normalized water leaving radiance at 412, 443, 488, 531, 551, and 667 nm, surface wind speeds from QuikSCAT, and sea surface height anomalies from Jason- 1.

At frequencies and wave vectors where the refraction is negative, the effective mass density and the effective stiffness tensors of the crystal can be positive-defnite, and that, this is an inherent property of phononic crystals with an isotropic stiff matrix containing periodically distributed isotropic compliant inclusions. The equi-frequency contours and energy ux vectors as fuctions of the phase-vector components, reveal a rich body of refractive properties that can be exploited to realize, for example, beam splitting, focusing, and frequency filtration on the lowest passbands of the crystal where the dissipation is the least.

We show that the acoustic farfields corresponding to the scattered waves by this collection of obstacles, taken to be soft obstacles, converge uniformly in terms of the incident as well the propagation directions, to the one corresponding to an <b>acoustic</b> <b>refraction</b> index as a→ 0. This refraction index is given as a product of two coefficients C and K, where the first one is related to the geometry of the obstacles (precisely their capacitance) and the second one is related to the local distribution of these obstacles. In addition, we provide explicit error estimates, in terms of a, in the case when the obstacles are locally the same (i. e. have the same capacitance, or the coefficient C is piecewise constant) in Ω and the coefficient K is Hölder continuous.

40|$|In the {{radial flow}} of gas {{into a black}} hole (i. e. Bondi accretion), the infall of any entropy or {{vorticity}} perturbation produces acoustic waves propagating outward. The dependence of this acoustic flux on {{the shape of the}} perturbation is investigated in detail. This is the key process in the mechanism of the entropic-acoustic instability proposed by Foglizzo & Tagger (2000) to explain the instability of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion. These acoustic waves create new entropy and vorticity perturbations when they reach the shock, thus closing the entropic-acoustic cycle. With an adiabatic index 1 <gamma<= 5 / 3, the linearized equations describing the perturbations of the Bondi flow are studied analytically and solved numerically. The fundamental frequency of this problem is the cut-off frequency of <b>acoustic</b> <b>refraction,</b> below which ingoing acoustic waves are refracted out. This cut-off is significantly smaller than the Keplerian frequency at the sonic radius and depends on the latitudinal number l of the perturbations. When advected adiabatically inward, entropy and vorticity perturbations trigger acoustic waves propagating outward, with an efficiency which is highest for non radial perturbations l= 1. The outgoing acoustic flux produced by the advection of vorticity perturbations is always moderate and peaks at rather low frequency. By contrast, the acoustic flux produced by an entropy wave is highest close to the refraction cut-off. It can be very large if gamma is close to 5 / 3. These results suggest that the shocked Bondi flow with gamma= 5 / 3 is strongly unstable with respect to the entropic-acoustic mechanism.

40|$|The {{research}} activity {{described in this}} thesis {{is concerned with the}} development and characterization of a standard for thermal energy and with the study of innovative applications and measuring solutions for smart heat metering. After an initial overview on {{the current state of the}} art and regulations for direct thermal energy measurement devices and heat accounting systems, the activities related to the development and the metrological characterization of the Italian standard of thermal energy, carried out at the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRIM), are presented and discussed. INRIM, according to its responsibilities as National Metrological Institute (NMI), realizes the primary standards for the basic and derived units of the International System of Units (SI) and ensures the operation and maintenance of such standards, providing the national metrological traceability to the SI. Along this line, the development and the characterization of the national standard for thermal energy is fundamental in order to ensure the metrological traceability of thermal energy measurements, which is achieved through an unbroken sequence of calibration steps, each characterized by its corresponding uncertainty. Such a metrological activity is essential for the provision of accurate measurements of the thermal energy exchanged by heat conveying fluids in a number of applications, contributing significantly to the improvement of the efficiency of energy systems and processes. The INRIM national standard for thermal energy has gone through deep changes since 2011, when extensive renovation works have been planned and carried out to improve its features and performances. Thus, a metrological analysis of the system was required to assess the quality of measurements, through the investigation of all the uncertainty contributions affecting the main measurement outputs of the system: water mass and volume flow rate and thermal energy. In particular, the activities related to the development and characterization of the national standard for thermal energy were focused on the set up of a new measurement system for testing and calibrating direct heat meters in experimental conditions close to the actual operating ones, the automatization of the whole measuring process and the evaluation of the uncertainty associated to the INRIM thermal energy standard. According to the Supplement 1 of the Guide to the expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM), the evaluation of the uncertainty has been carried out by means of the Monte Carlo method, which allows evaluating the probability distribution of the measurands from the probability density functions associated to the input quantities of the measurement model. In order to evaluate and confirm the metrological capabilities of the INRIM measurement system and method with respect to other NMIs' laboratories worldwide, a pilot study on the comparison between national standards for thermal energy has been organized with the PTB Heat and Vacuum department in Berlin (Working Group 7. 52, New Methods for Thermal Energy Measurement). Such an activity has been detailed from the design of the test plan for the comparison, to the discussion of the results of the first round of tests carried out at INRIM. The experimental plan has allowed observing and analyzing the effect of fluid temperature on the volume flow measurement provided by the electromagnetic flow meter used as transfer standard for the comparison. Since flow meters are typically calibrated at ambient flow conditions, understanding and quantifying the temperature effect on volume flow measurement is important, in particular, for heat metering applications. Furthermore, the analyses of two innovative measuring solutions for the non-invasive flow rate and temperature measurement in pipe flows, which can be effectively applied to thermal energy measurement, are presented and discussed. The first is related to the combined measurement of flow rate and temperature in liquid pipe flows by the clamp-on transit-time ultrasonic technique. In particular, the feasibility and the accuracy of such a non-intrusive measuring solution for the simultaneous measurement of flow rate and temperature has been analyzed by modelling the ultrasound propagation in a typical clamp-on sensor for a wide set of simulated measuring conditions. From the results of the numerical simulation, it has been possible to observe how the temperature dependent <b>acoustic</b> <b>refraction</b> of ultrasound beams can affect the accuracy of these sensors, in particular, in terms of non-intrusive temperature measurement. The second measuring solution is related to the proposal of a direct heat metering technique, based on the non-invasive measurement of the fluid flow rate circulating through a generic heat exchanger, exploiting the correlation between fluid velocity and internal heat transfer coefficient in forced pipe flows. A preliminary thermal fluid dynamic analysis has been carried out for different simulated operating conditions, in order to get a first evaluation of the feasibility and the accuracy of this non-invasive measuring technique. One of the most important application fields for heat metering devices is the measurement of thermal energy consumptions in buildings. In such a context, the fair heat cost allocation among the residents of multi-apartments and multi-purpose buildings with central heating systems, based on the accurate measurement of the actual individual thermal energy consumptions, represents an effective tool to promote energy saving and improve energy efficiency, as declared by the European Directive 2012 / 27 /EU, recently implemented in Italy by the Decree 102 / 2014. Anyway, in many cases, i. e. in outdated central heating systems with vertical hot water distribution networks (rising main central heating plant configuration), the accurate measurement of individual thermal energy consumptions by means of the measures of flow rate and temperature difference of the heat conveying fluid (direct heat metering) may be neither feasible nor affordable because of installation and economic constraints. In these situations, indirect methods for the estimation of individual heat consumptions or innovative heat accounting solutions should be applied, providing their compliancy to at least one of the current technical standards for heat metering or heat cost allocation. Along this line, a novel heat cost allocation method for apartment buildings has been proposed and validated. Such a heat accounting method is particularly suitable for central heating systems characterized by room heating radiators connected to vertical hot water distribution networks and provides the indirect estimation of individual thermal energy consumptions without the need of temperature measurements at radiator heating surfaces. The proposed heat cost allocation method is based on the hydraulic modelling of hot water distribution networks, which allows estimating the water flow rates circulating through each radiator from the measurement of the overall water flow rate in the circuit and the corresponding head loss. The novel indirect heat accounting method has been validated at the INRIM central heating system test facility, a unique laboratory, consisting of 40 fully-instrumented water radiators equipped with a SI-traceable direct heat meter each and connected to an automatically reconfigurable hydraulic circuit, which allows testing indirect heat cost allocation methods in experimental conditions very close to those in the field...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of perturbation approaches to simulate airframe noise mechanisms of aircraft during landing approach is discussed. Euler-perturbation approaches that simulate sound generation at obstacles due to upstream injected test-vorticity allow {{to assess the}} efficiency of a geometry to transform vortical energy into acoustic energy. Acoustic analogies with sources determined either by an unsteady flow simulation or described statistically yield hybrid two-step methods that in addition {{take into account the}} turbulent source strength. An acoustic analogy is presented that uses acoustic perturbation equations (APE) for the simulation of the acoustic radiation problem in space and time. The <b>acoustic</b> convection and <b>refraction</b> effects are part of the simulation of wave propagation such that the source domain is limited to the vicinity of the sound generating geometry where the unsteady vorticity has a considerable magnitude. Using linearized acoustic perturbation equations the unbounded growth of hydrodynamic instabilities in critical mean flows is prevented completely. Computational results for trailing edge noise based on a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of the compressible flow problem and acoustic perturbation equations for the acoustic simulation are presented. The acoustic source terms are computed furthermore from a synthetic turbulence model and first results for trailing edge noise are presented. The far field sound field is computed via Kirchhoff extrapolation...|$|R
40|$|For weakly {{compressible}} turbulent fluctuations {{there exists}} a small parameter, {{the square of the}} fluctuating Mach number, that allows an investigation using a perturbative treatment. The consequences of such a perturbative analysis in three different subject areas are described: 1) initial conditions in direct numerical simulations, 2) an explanation for the oscillations seen in the compressible pressure in the direct numerical simulations of homogeneous shear, and 3) for turbulence closures accounting for the compressibility of velocity fluctuations. Initial conditions consistent with small turbulent Mach number asymptotics are constructed. The importance of consistent initial conditions in the direct numerical simulation of compressible turbulence is dramatically illustrated: spurious oscillations associated with inconsistent initial conditions are avoided, and the fluctuating dilatational field is some two orders of magnitude smaller for a compressible isotropic turbulence. For the isotropic decay it is shown that the choice of initial conditions can change the scaling law for the compressible dissipation. A two-time expansion of the Navier-Stokes equations is used to distinguish compressible acoustic and compressible advective modes. A simple conceptual model for weakly compressible turbulence - a forced linear oscillator is described. It is shown that the evolution equations for the compressible portions of turbulence can be understood as a forced wave equation with <b>refraction.</b> <b>Acoustic</b> modes of the flow can be amplified by refraction and are able to manifest themselves in large fluctuations of the compressible pressure...|$|R
40|$|Sonar-beam-steering {{devices of}} the {{proposed}} type would contain no moving parts and would be considerably smaller and less power-hungry, relative to conventional multiple-beam sonar arrays. The proposed devices are under consideration for installation on future small autonomous underwater vehicles because the sizes and power demands of conventional multiple-beam arrays are excessive, and motors used in single-beam mechanically scanned systems are also not reliable. The proposed devices would include a variety of electrically controllable acoustic prisms, lenses, and prism/lens combinations both simple and compound. These devices would contain electrorheological fluids (ERFs) between electrodes. An ERF typically consists of dielectric particles floating in a dielectric fluid. When an electric field {{is applied to the}} fluid, the particles become grouped into fibrils aligned in rows, with a consequent increase in the viscosity of the fluid and a corresponding increase in the speed of sound in the fluid. The change in the speed of sound increases with an increase in the applied electric field. By thus varying the speed of sound, one varies the <b>acoustic</b> index of <b>refraction,</b> analogously to varying the index of refraction of an optical lens or prism. In the proposed acoustic devices, this effect would be exploited to control the angles of <b>refraction</b> of <b>acoustic</b> beams, thereby steering the beams and, in the case of lenses, controlling focal lengths...|$|R
