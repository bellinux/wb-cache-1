40|$|This {{book is a}} {{collection}} of papers presented at Acoustics and Vibration of Mechanical Structures 2017 – AVMS 2017 – highlighting the current trends and state-of-the-art developments in the field. It covers a broad range of topics, such as <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> vibration control, <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> vibration generation and propagation, the effects of <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> vibration, condition monitoring and vibration testing, modeling, prediction <b>and</b> simulation of <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> vibration, environmental <b>and</b> occupational <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> vibration, <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> vibration attenuators, as well as biomechanics and bioacoustics. The book also presents analytical, numerical and experimental techniques for evaluating linear <b>and</b> non-linear <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> vibration problems (including strong nonlinearity). It is primarily intended for academics, researchers and professionals, as well as PhD students in various fields of the acoustics and vibration of mechanical structures...|$|R

5|$|Like {{other large}} whales, the {{humpback}} was {{a target for}} the whaling industry. Once hunted {{to the brink of}} extinction, its population fell by an estimated 90% before a 1966 moratorium.

5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, {{faster and more}} {{aggressive}} styles such as hardcore punk (e.g. Minor Threat), street punk (e.g. the Exploited), and anarcho-punk (e.g. Crass) had become the predominant mode of punk rock. Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk also pursued {{a broad range of}} other variations, giving rise to post-punk and new wave and later indie pop, alternative rock, <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> rock. By the 1990s, punk rock had re-emerged in the mainstream, as pop punk bands such as Green Day and the Offspring brought the genre widespread popularity.|$|E
5|$|Control {{systems have}} a need for {{smoothing}} filters in their feedback loops with criteria to maximise the speed of movement of a mechanical system to the prescribed mark {{and at the same}} time minimise overshoot <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> induced motions. A key problem here is the extraction of Gaussian signals from a noisy background. An early paper on this was published during WWII by Norbert Wiener with the specific application to anti-aircraft fire control analogue computers. Rudy Kalman (Kalman filter) later reformulated this in terms of state-space smoothing and prediction where it is known as the linear-quadratic-Gaussian control problem. Kalman started an interest in state-space solutions, but according to Darlington this approach can also be found in the work of Heaviside and earlier.|$|E

Their first album was much more {{accessible}} and melodic than the usual industrial style, and included hired work by trained musicians. Later work returned to the sound collage <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> elements of earlier industrial. They also borrowed from funk and disco. P-Orridge also founded Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, a quasi-religious organization that produced video art. Psychic TV's commercial aspirations were managed by Stevo of Some Bizzare records, who released many of the later industrial musicians, including Eistürzende Neubauten, Test Dept, and Cabaret Voltaire.|$|E

5|$|Grindcore is {{an extreme}} genre of music that {{originated}} {{in the early to}} mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from the most abrasive-sounding musical styles: hardcore punk, extreme metal, industrial <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.|$|E

She won universal acclaim and a National Film Award – Special Jury Award for her performance {{as a young woman}} with cerebral palsy in the coming of age drama Margarita with a Straw (2014).

5|$|Local {{officials}} in Allegan have proposed {{creation of a}} truck route around the town. Concerned about the traffic <b>and</b> <b>noise,</b> residents have formed the Citizens for a Safer Community. They cite reports that show that the accident rates in town are higher than the statewide average. The group and local officials are proposing using 24th Street, 118th Avenue and Babylon Road for truck traffic. MDOT would require permits to erect the signs needed for the truck route. The department has indicated that the bypass {{would not be a}} state highway. MDOT will not take ownership of the roads needed for the truck route, but overall the department is supportive of the city's efforts to make the downtown area more pedestrian friendly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Used of {{the element}} {{enrichment}} model, the multifractal {{detrended fluctuation analysis}} (MF-DFA) is applied to analyze the multifractal property for sequences which were added stochastic <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> spike <b>noise,</b> <b>and</b> then we discuss the noise effect on the scaling exponent. The result shows that the scaling exponent is stable under stochastic <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> spike <b>noise.</b> For q> 0, the influence on the scaling exponent is rather small when the element enrichment model was added stochastic <b>noise,</b> <b>and</b> the difference is getting smaller with the increasing parameter p; When adding spike noise whose strength is from 1. 5 times to 2. 5 times, the corresponding influence is consistent, it indicates that MF-DFA method has a better noise immunity against stochastic <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> spike <b>noise</b> under given conditions...|$|R
5|$|Risk parity advocates {{assert that}} the unlevered risk parity {{portfolio}} is quite close to the tangency portfolio, as close as can be measured given uncertainties <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> in the data. Theoretical and empirical arguments are made {{in support of this}} contention. One specific set of assumptions that puts the risk parity portfolio on the efficient frontier is that the individual asset classes are uncorrelated and have identical Sharpe ratios. Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity portfolio is near the tangency portfolio but they say that the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk parity portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.|$|E

According to Caltrain, electrification of the tracks will allow it to improve service times via faster acceleration and shorter headways, reduce air pollution <b>and</b> <b>noise,</b> and facilitate a future railway tunnel (the Downtown Rail Extension) into downtown San Francisco's Transbay Transit Center (as diesel trains cannot serve underground stations).|$|E

Shenley Primary School reportedly failed to receive any visits from players despite repeated requests. The club responded by pointing to initiatives by its Ladies team to organise competitions at local grounds. Plans to develop new buildings and road links to the site were challenged by residents four years later; they believed {{it would lead to}} increased traffic <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> pollution in the area.|$|E

5|$|The {{light rail}} model {{would have used}} the same {{approach}} as the tram in Ørestad, but would instead have run through a tunnel in the city centre. The tunnel sections would be shorter, but the diameter larger {{because it would have}} to accommodate overhead wires. The system would have the same frequency as the tram, but use double trams and would therefore require larger stations. The metro solution was chosen because it combined the highest average speeds, the highest passenger capacity, the lowest visual <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> impact, and the lowest number of accidents. Despite requiring the highest investment, it had the highest net present value.|$|E

Now known as GALCIT Project Number 1, they continued to be ostracized by other Caltech scientists who grew increasingly irritated by their accidents <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> pollution, and were made to relocate their experiments back to the Arroyo Seco, at a site with unventilated, corrugated iron sheds that served as both research facilities and administrative offices. It was here that JPL would be founded. Parsons and Forman's rocket experiments were the cover story of the August 1940 edition of Popular Mechanics, in which the pair discussed the prospect of rockets being able to ascend above Earth's atmosphere and orbit around it for research purposes, as well as reaching the Moon.|$|E
