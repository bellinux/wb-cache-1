25|$|Another stylistic choice {{she makes}} is {{frequently}} beginning with an epigraph from the written {{records of the}} long assault on Native Peoples. Often she uses this epigraph from the historical, archeological world, as a jumping off point for her poetry which is narrated by a Native-identified voice, allowing for the reader to draw {{the connection between the}} two. This juxtaposition brings the “historical artifact” of bone or cloth to life <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the skin being literally ripped away with the language of the poetry and giving the casual observer a real vision of that object.|$|E
500|$|... "A Golden Crown" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Todd VanDerWerff from the A.V. Club gave it an A-, and Maureen Ryan from AOL TV rated {{it with a}} 70 out of 100. HitFix's Alan Sepinwall titled his review [...] "The rules get upended in a terrific episode." [...] Both Elio Garcia from westeros.org and Jace Lacob from Televisionary considered it the best episode of the series so far. In the words of reviewer Jace Lacob, the episode [...] "revolves around changes both great and small, {{about the way the}} scales can fall from our eyes <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the truth that has been standing in front of us for so long. For Eddard, it's a realization of just why Jon Arryn died, of the terrible secret he had gleaned from the book of royal lineages, and just what this could mean for the throne...and for the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. For Dany, it's the brutal truth of her brother's real nature, of his insatiable thirst for power and the twisted quality of his rampant heart." ...|$|E

This move to the mainstream culture includes cultural assimilation", writes literary researcher and critic Mati Shmuelof.|$|E

60|$|If I {{were to take}} an {{oak tree}} as a {{specimen}} of the plant world, I should find that it originated in an acorn, which, too, commenced in a cell; the acorn {{is placed in the}} ground, and it very speedily begins to absorb the inorganic matters I have named, adds enormously to its bulk, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> it, year after year, extending itself upward and downward, attracting and appropriating to itself inorganic materials, which it vivifies, and eventually, as it ripens, gives off its own proper acorns, which again run the same course.

60|$|On {{the whole}} we find {{considerable}} {{diversity in the}} signs of affirmation and negation in the different races of man. With respect to negation, if we admit that the shaking of the finger or hand {{from side to side}} is symbolic of the lateral movement of the head; and if we admit that the sudden backward movement of the head represents one of the actions often practised by young children in refusing food, then there is much uniformity throughout the world in the signs of negation, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> how they originated. The most marked exceptions are presented by the Arabs, Esquimaux, some Australian tribes, and Dyaks. With the latter a frown is the sign of negation, and with us frowning often accompanies a lateral shake of the head.|$|E

60|$|Aggressive Power of the Scandinavian Flora.--The first {{important}} fact bearing {{upon this}} question is the wonderful aggressive and colonising power of the Scandinavian flora, {{as shown by the}} way in which it establishes itself in any temperate country to which it may gain access. About 150 species have thus established themselves in New Zealand, often taking possession of large tracts of country; about the same number are found in Australia, and nearly as many in the Atlantic states of America, where they form the commonest weeds. Whether or not we accept Mr. Darwin's explanation of this power as due to development in the most extensive land area of the globe where competition has been most severe and long-continued, the fact of the existence of this power remains, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> how important an agent it must be in the formation of the floras of any lands to which these aggressive plants have been able to gain access.|$|E

(3) The {{question}} of time, {{so long as}} we confine ourselves to one private world, is rather less complicated than that of space, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> pretty clearly how it might be dealt with by such methods as we have been considering. Events of which we are conscious do not last merely for a mathematical instant, but always for some finite time, however short. Even if there be a physical world such as the mathematical theory of motion supposes, impressions on our sense-organs produce sensations which are not merely and strictly instantaneous, and therefore the objects of sense of which we are immediately conscious are not strictly instantaneous. Instants, therefore, are not among the data of experience, and, if legitimate, must be either inferred or constructed. It is difficult to see how they can be validly inferred; thus we are left with the alternative that they must be constructed. How is this to be done? ...|$|E

He occupies a high-backed bench in front of a great chimney; red and black ink are before him; and {{the upper end of the}} apartment is guarded by many halberdiers, with the red cross of England on their breast. On the next side of the tower he appears again, leaning out of window and gazing on the river; doubtless there blows just then [...] "a pleasant wind from out the land of France," [...] and some ship comes up the river: [...] "the ship of good news." [...] At the door we find him yet again; this time embracing a messenger, while a groom stands by holding two saddled horses. And yet farther to the left, a cavalcade defiles out of the tower; the duke is on his way at last towards [...] "the sunshine of France." ...|$|E
