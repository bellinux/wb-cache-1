5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean off {{the west coast}} of Africa during the last week of July. As it tracked across the Atlantic, it remained a well-defined system, but never organized into a tropical cyclone. On August8, the system entered the Gulf of Mexico, and by the following day, it developed a weak low-level circulation. The circulation became better defined later that day, and was confirmed by Reconnaissance aircraft that <b>afternoon,</b> <b>when</b> it was declared Tropical Depression Eight while east of Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|In humans, body {{temperature}} is typically highest during {{the mid to}} late afternoon. However, human athletes being tested for physical vigor on exercise machines showed no statistically significant difference after lunch. Owners of factory farms are advised to use buildings with an east–west (as opposed to north–south) orientation to house their livestock, because an east–west orientation generally means thicker walls on the east and west to accommodate the sun's acute angle and intense glare during late <b>afternoon.</b> <b>When</b> these animals are too hot, {{they are more likely to}} become belligerent and unproductive.|$|E

As for the reconstituted 85th Battalion, it was ordered to occupy Jebel Mariam, Heneidac and Touscan. The battalion's commander, Lt. Col. Monsif, found during a {{reconnaissance}} that Touscan was surrounded by large Israeli forces and under heavy fire, and so limited his battalion's defenses to Jebel Mariam and Heneidac only, occupying the former with the battalion's main forces, including two companies of paratroopers, and placing a single company at Heneidac.|$|E

5|$|Dust {{kicked up}} by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the {{darkness}} of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly {{the sound of an}} approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's updraft base, which is rain-free, making them visible. Also, most tornadoes occur in the late <b>afternoon,</b> <b>when</b> the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. Night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.|$|E
5|$|Supporting the Japanese {{landings}} were seaplanes from Kamikawa Maru, temporarily {{based at}} Thousand Ships Bay at Santa Isabel Island. About 400 Japanese naval troops—mainly from the 3rd Kure Special Naval Landing Force—disembarked from the transport ship on barges and immediately began construction of facilities on Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo. Aircraft from Shōhō covered the landings until early <b>afternoon,</b> <b>when</b> Gotō's force turned toward Bougainville to refuel in preparation {{to support the}} landings at Port Moresby. Once the Japanese troops were ashore, six seaplanes landed in Tulagi harbor {{as part of the}} establishment of the planned seaplane base there.|$|E
5|$|The afternoon, {{especially}} the early afternoon, {{is associated with}} a dip in a variety of areas of human cognitive and productive functioning. Notably, motor vehicle accidents occur more frequently in the early <b>afternoon,</b> <b>when</b> drivers presumably have recently finished lunch. A study of motor accidents in Sweden between 1987 and 1991 found that the time around 5 pm had by far the most accidents: around 1,600 at 5 pm compared to around 1,000 each at 4 pm and 6 pm. This trend may have been influenced by the afternoon rush hour, but the morning rush hour showed a much smaller increase. In Finland, accidents in the agriculture industry are most common in the afternoon, specifically Monday afternoons in September.|$|E

At the same time, he ordered the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade (with the 1st Light Horse Brigade in support) to attack the Ottoman garrison holding fortifications on Tel el Saba. These hard-fought attacks continued into the <b>afternoon,</b> <b>when</b> two regiments of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade (Australian Mounted Division) were ordered to reinforce the Anzac Mounted Division's attack on Tel el Saba.|$|E

5|$|Following {{this the}} commandos were used mainly as highly trained {{infantry}} units {{for the rest}} of their involvement in the North African campaign and for the majority of this time they were attached to the 36th Infantry Brigade. Over the course of the next five months the commandos were involved in a number of costly attacks and periods of static defence, in between which they carried out aggressive fighting patrols. Indicative of the nature of the fighting during this time was No. 6 Commando's attack on the Green Hill feature on 30 November 1942. The main attack was launched at 4:00am, as three troops—Nos. 3, 4 and 6 Troops—attacked from the north and west, while No. 5 Troop conducted a diversionary attack from the flank. As soon as the main force left its line of departure it came under intense oblique fire from interlocking medium and heavy machine guns positioned in a diamond-shaped perimeter on top of the hill. The fire was so intense that the troop providing support by fire on the flank was unable to suppress it and the attack was temporarily postponed until the <b>afternoon</b> <b>when</b> it was hoped that artillery support could be utilised.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{comes from}} frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (Sudestada), which bring {{long periods of}} precipitation, cloudy weather and cooler temperatures. Winters are cloudy while relative humidity is very high, often 90% or higher, making the weather dull, grey and cool. Occasionally, warm air masses from the north bring warmer temperatures. These warm air masses can bring sunny weather, particularly during the <b>afternoon</b> <b>when</b> {{they come from the}} north or northwest {{as a result of a}} trough located in central Argentina. On the other hand, warm air masses from Brazil bring humid conditions, featuring high humidity with high cloud cover that is typical of a warm front of a frontal system and typical of tropical maritime air. These warm air masses that are responsible for the high humidity and cloud cover are the warmest air masses, leading to the warmest temperatures. Nonetheless, these are short lived as the Chaco Low, which is responsible for bringing in warm and tropical air from the north is weaker in winter due to lower insolation, leading to the winds from the north being less intense and shorter lived.|$|E
5|$|Still {{farther north}} along the {{mountain}} ridge, in the Battle Mountain area, the battle was going poorly for the 24th Infantry. After C Company lost Battle Mountain, heavy UN airstrikes and artillery fire struck its crest in preparation for an infantry counterattack planned to regain the mountain from the North Koreans. The hot and sultry weather made climbing the steep slope difficult, but L Company was on top by 12:00 on August 21. North Korean troops had left the summit under fire from the UN aircraft, artillery, and mortars. The North Koreans placed their own mortar fire on the crest and prevented L Company from consolidating its position. This situation continued until mid <b>afternoon</b> <b>when</b> a North Korean platoon {{came out of the}} trenches on the eastern slope of the mountain and surprised a platoon of L Company with an attack from behind. The other two platoons of L Company, upon hearing firing, started to leave their positions and drift down the hill. The North Koreans swiftly reoccupied the peak while officers tried to assemble L and I Companies on the eastern slope. Elements of E Company also left their position during the day.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Airlanding Brigade, {{with the}} Belgians and Dutch under its command, {{had to contend}} with German delaying tactics. The lead battalions {{advanced}} under heavy mortar and machine gun fire, until stopped by a strong defensive position at Cabourg. The 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles, unable to outflank the position, were ordered to dig in. The next day, the battalion was relieved by the Belgians and moved to a brigade concentration point, first at Le Plein and then at Troan, which they reached by the morning of 21August. The 6th Airlanding Brigade advance continued from here with the 12th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment in the lead. The battalion was unopposed until that <b>afternoon,</b> <b>when</b> they had several casualties from German mortar and machine-gun fire. With night approaching the battalion had to dig in, and prepared to continue the advance the next day. At 03:00 on 22August, the battalion started an outflanking attack on Branville, which they occupied by 08:00, and later the same day they liberated Vauville and Deauville, where they secured the high ground {{to the north of the}} town.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{continued}} to advance into {{the outskirts of}} Singapore throughout 14 February. Threatened with being isolated, the Australians made plans to make a last stand. With the Japanese closing in, the island's civilian population began to suffer heavily as they were subjected to heavy artillery bombardment and aerial attacks from Japanese aircraft that were increasingly unopposed as anti-aircraft guns ran out of ammunition. Supplies of water and food also dwindled, and the water shortage was made worse {{by the loss of}} the island's reservoirs. Finally, in the morning of 15 February, after the Japanese had succeeded in infiltrating towards Mount Pleasant Ridge, Percival determined that a counterattack was not viable and instead decided to surrender the garrison. The battalion's final involvement in the fighting came that <b>afternoon</b> <b>when</b> 'A' and 'D' Companies were heavily shelled. A short time later, at 8:30pm, the surrender came into effect and the men of the 2/18th received orders not to escape.|$|E
5|$|Albert Payson Terhune was an {{established}} newspaperman {{and author of}} several books in various genresincluding histories and thrillerswhen he penned his first canine short story, His Mate. Ray Long, then editor for Red Book Magazine, had jokingly suggested he write a story about Lad one <b>afternoon,</b> <b>when</b> the reticent dog put his head on Long's knee after having snubbed the familiar visitor for the last year. Having already tried to market the idea of his writing dog stories to magazines for several years, Terhune readily agreed. The first story featured three rough collies, Lad, Lady, and Knave, and used a similar formula to his previous works: an average male (Lad) protects a beautiful female (Lady) from a larger villain (Knave). Long purchased the work for Red Book for $200 and it was published in the January 1916 issue. Four magazines requested similar stories, and Terhune complied, finding them easy to write and sell. Additional stories, all featuring Lad and titled Lad Stories, were published in the Saturday Evening Post, Ladies' Home Journal, Hartford Courant, and the Atlantic Monthly, though Red Book remained his most consistent publisher. By 1918, the stories had grown in popularity and Terhune was paid an average of $1000 each for the tales, with some selling for as much as $2,500,. Though marketed as fiction, even people who were acquainted with the Terhunes and Lad reportedly believed that the stories were real.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with Nedeljković's orders, Marić's 27th Infantry Division Savska was {{to undertake a}} counterattack against the Zákány bridgehead on 8 April. Supported by two batteries of Skoda 75 mm Model 1928 mountain guns of the 27th Artillery Regiment, the attack consisted of three columns converging on the bridgehead. The right column, attacking from the area of Bregi, was to consist of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment supported by the divisional machine gun company. The centre column, consisting of the 53rd Infantry Regiment and {{the remnants of the}} 2nd Battalion of the 36th Infantry Regiment and the 1st Battalion of the 35th Infantry Regiment, directly supported by the 1st Battery of the 27th Artillery Regiment, would attack from Koprivnica. The left column, attacking from the vicinity of Herešin, was to consist of the dismounted 81st Cavalry Regiment. As promised support from the 36th Infantry Regiment, 81st Cavalry Regiment and army-level artillery had not materialised, Marić postponed the counterattack to 16:00. By noon, a full-scale revolt had broken out within the flanking 40th Infantry Division Slavonska, resulting in the capture of the town of Bjelovar and {{a large portion of the}} 4th Army headquarters by the rebels that <b>afternoon.</b> <b>When</b> the attack on the bridgehead at Zákány was eventually launched, only the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and the 1st Squadron of the 81st Cavalry Regiment remained in contact with the Germans, south of Peteranec, and the 2nd Cavalry Regiment held that area throughout the night of 8/9 April, despite heavy German artillery fire. Of the other units involved in the counterattack, most were only at 25 percent of their full strength due to Ustaše-influenced desertions sparked by the rebellion within the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska. Two battalions of the 36th Infantry Regiment deserted during the day.|$|E
