5|$|The American robin has a {{place in}} Native American mythology. The {{story of how the}} robin got its red breast by fanning the dying flames of <b>a</b> <b>campfire</b> to save a Native American man and a boy is similar to those that {{surround}} the European robin. The Tlingit people of Northwestern North America held it to be a culture hero created by Raven to please the people with its song. One of the houses of the Raven Tribe from the Nisga'a Nation holds the robin as a house crest.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{set out for}} help, {{unaware that}} Maggie is tagging along, while Marge and Lisa stay behind. Separated from Homer and Bart, Maggie is soon adopted by a family of bears. Meanwhile, Homer and Bart plummet into a raging river where they lose their clothes, but hide their nakedness with leaves and mud. Marge and Lisa make {{themselves}} comfortable by <b>a</b> <b>campfire,</b> while the boys freeze in the wilderness. The next day, Homer tries to steal honey from a beehive, only to be attacked by the bees, but evades them by jumping into a mud pit. A nature photographer takes a picture of Homer covered in mud, mistaking him for Bigfoot, and soon the forest is inundated with Bigfoot enthusiasts and reward seekers.|$|E
5|$|Instructional {{literature}} uses standard tuning. Traditionally {{a course}} {{begins with the}} hand in first position, that is, with the left-hand covering frets 1–4. Beginning players first learn open chords belonging to the major keys C,G, andD. Guitarists who play mainly open chords in these three major-keys and their relative minor-keys (Am,Em,Bm) may prefer standard tuning over an M3tuning. In particular, hobbyists playing folkmusic around <b>a</b> <b>campfire</b> are well served by standard tuning. Such hobbyists may also play major-thirds tuning, which also has many open chords with notes on five or six strings; chords with five-six strings have greater volume than chords with three-four strings and so are useful for acoustic guitars (for example, acoustic-electric guitars without amplification).|$|E

5|$|The video cuts {{between two}} narratives. In the first, a hunter (uncredited actor) straps a 16-gauge shotgun around his shoulder, and tracks {{footsteps}} through the snow, eventually finding the Swamplord (the band's mascot, here as depicted {{on the covers}} of The Black Waltz and For the Revolution). In the second narrative, the band members, dressed warmly in heavy clothing, are sitting around <b>a</b> <b>campfire,</b> preparing a kettle of an unknown drink. As each person takes a sip, they begin convulsing. To simulate the drink's effects, the camera used shaking and rapid zooming. As the song finishes, Pekka pours himself a drink and is the only one immune to its effects.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kesha waking {{up next to}} her love interest; she then {{proceeds}} to run away while being chased by the man. Kesha walks through the desert while split scenes of her are shown where she is riding an elephant and wearing a tiger mask while crawling around in the sand. They are later seen on a boat singing and pretending to row while digitally animated water is added. It then cuts to a scene of all animation in which Kesha is portrayed as a mermaid. The mermaid and the man share a kiss; the video then jumps to a scene on a rocky hillside with Kesha walking around the sand with the man standing above on a rock. The video then cuts to another scene where Kesha is covered in glow in the dark body paint while dancing around in a cave with a python around her neck. The video ends with Kesha and her lover sitting around <b>a</b> <b>campfire</b> while still in the desert.|$|E
5|$|Tommy Dolan is a {{radio show}} host and news {{reporter}} from Los Angeles, who regularly travels incognito into the wilderness to collect strangers' stories for his show Tommy Dolan on the Road. His first appearance in the series occurs when he meets Brother Justin around <b>a</b> <b>campfire.</b> After retelling Brother Justin's story of the burned-down ministry in his radio show, Dolan approaches Brother Justin's sister Iris and helps her with receiving funds for a new church. Dolan is seemingly attracted to Iris, but Brother Justin's return prevents further advances. By the beginning of season 2, Dolan has fulfilled Brother Justin's wish to become a radio preacher, yet police evidence surfaces first hinting at Brother Justin's, then Iris' guilt in the arson. Trying to further his career, Dolan collects evidence until Brother Justin accepts the arrangement of a special confession announcement for Iris. The confession backfires and Dolan is arrested, with Iris's guilt never proven.|$|E
