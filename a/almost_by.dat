25|$|The ‘Great Mortality’, as it {{was then}} known, entered Yorkshire around February 1349 and quickly spread through the diocese. The clergy were on the front line of the disease, {{bringing}} comfort to the dying, hearing final confessions and organising burials. This, <b>almost</b> <b>by</b> necessity, put them at a greater risk of infection.|$|E

Another gentleman made an offer on the home, which Bob accepted – using the profits to build more houses and, later, duplexes. Commercial projects followed, and Nabholz Construction was born.|$|E

25|$|An {{unreliable}} {{narrator is}} a narrator, whether in literature, film, or theatre, whose credibility has been seriously compromised. The term was coined in 1961 by Wayne C. Booth in The Rhetoric of Fiction. While unreliable narrators are <b>almost</b> <b>by</b> definition first-person narrators, arguments {{have been made}} {{for the existence of}} unreliable second- and third-person narrators, especially within the context of film and television.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{they have}} been {{independent}} newspapers, with the Groat as a Wick-centred paper and the Courier as a Thurso-centred paper. Even now, the Groat is archived in the public library in Wick, while the Courier is similarly archived in the library in Thurso. The Courier was printed, <b>almost</b> <b>by</b> hand, in a small shop in High Street, Thurso until the early 60's by Mr Docherty and his daughter. The Courier traditionally covers that week's sheriff court cases.|$|E
25|$|It took a major act of {{will for}} the party to decide to soldier on as an {{independent}} force, which it did in repudiating Lowery, and deciding to contest the 1971 election, however hopeless the prospects might be. The party chose, <b>almost</b> <b>by</b> default, Robert Russell of St. Albert, a highly controversial figure who had been passed over twice, but who had a strong desire for the position, and who had strongly supported David Hunter's vision {{for the party}}.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{manufacturers}} {{such as the}} Ives Manufacturing Company, American Flyer, and Lionel Corporation used O gauge {{for their}} budget line, marketing either Gauge 1 or 'Wide gauge' (also known as 'standard gauge') as their premium trains. One of the Lionel Corporation's most popular trains, the 203 Armoured Locomotive, was O gauge and ran on tracks with rails spaced 1.25 inches apart. The Great Depression wiped out demand for the expensive larger trains, and by 1932, O gauge was the standard, <b>almost</b> <b>by</b> default.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of 1919, {{fighting}} broke out <b>almost</b> <b>by</b> accident and without any orders from the respective governments, when self-organized Polish military units in Kresy ("Borderland") areas of Lithuania, Belarus and western Ukraine (the Samoobrona Litwy i Białorusi numbering approximately ~2,000 soldiers under general Wejtko) clashed with local communist units and advance Bolshevik forces, each trying to secure the territories for its own incipient government. Eventually the more organised Soviet forces quelled most of the resistance and drove the remaining forces west.|$|E
25|$|Onegin himself, however, {{tried as}} he could to prevent the fatal outcome, and killed Lensky unwillingly and <b>almost</b> <b>by</b> accident. As the first shooter, he couldn't {{show that he was}} {{deliberately}} trying to miss the opponent, because this was considered as a serious insult and could create a formal reason to appoint another duel. Instead, he tried to minimize his chances by shooting without precise aiming, from the maximal possible distance, not even trying to come closer and get a clear shot.|$|E

25|$|Christopher Awdry, {{for whom}} the stories were first devised, {{continued}} writing the stories <b>almost</b> <b>by</b> accident. He was a keen railway enthusiast like his father, {{and it was on}} a visit to the Nene Valley Railway that he received the inspiration for his first story. A railwayman's account of a locomotive running out of steam short of its destination became Triple Header, a story in which Thomas, Percy and Duck take on Gordon's Express but find it more than they can handle. Christopher devised three other stories, Stop Thief!, Mind That Bike and Fish.|$|E
25|$|Maccagno, who was {{leader of}} the {{minuscule}} opposition in the Legislature, served as interim leader, but did not regard himself as leadership material. In a convention which exposed the deep ideological fault lines within the party, Adrian Douglas Berry, a Calgary aldermam, emerged as leader from a highly acrimonious contest. Internal dissensions continued, and late in 1966, Berry resigned under circumstances still not explained. As a provincial election could be expected within months, Maccagno became leader <b>almost</b> <b>by</b> default, and somewhat unwillingly led the party into the 1967 provincial election.|$|E
25|$|In {{his attempt}} to rescue his cocaine-addicted brother from the {{influence}} of Kiki, Edward VIII of the United Kingdom attempted {{for a while to}} persuade both George and Kiki to break off their contact, to no avail. Eventually, Edward forced George to stop seeing Kiki and also forced Kiki to leave England, while she was visiting George there in the summer of 1929. For years afterwards, Edward feared that George might relapse to drugs if he maintained his contact with Kiki. Indeed, in 1932, Prince George ran into Kiki unexpectedly at Cannes and had to be removed <b>almost</b> <b>by</b> force.|$|E

25|$|The local {{environment}} and the construction materials it can provide, govern many aspects of vernacular architecture. Areas rich in trees will develop a wooden vernacular, while areas without much wood may use mud or stone. In early California redwood water towers supporting redwood tanks and enclosed by redwood siding (tankhouses) {{were part of a}} self-contained wind-powered domestic water system. In the Far East it is common to use bamboo, as it is both plentiful and versatile. Vernacular, <b>almost</b> <b>by</b> definition, is sustainable, and will not exhaust the local resources. If it is not sustainable, it is not suitable for its local context, and cannot be vernacular.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{performance}} {{demonstrated by the}} Snipe was unimpressive (tests at Martlesham Heath in October 1918 had shown that the Snipe was inferior to the Martinsyde F.3 and Fokker D.VII), it {{was selected as the}} standard postwar single-seat fighter of the RAF <b>almost</b> <b>by</b> default, with the Martinsyde Buzzard development of the F.3 being 25 percent more expensive than the Snipe and relying on a French engine that was in short supply (the 300hp Hispano-Suiza 8), while the range of fighters powered by the ABC Dragonfly radial engine did not come to fruition owing to failure of that engine. The last Snipes were retired by that service in 1926.|$|E
25|$|In 1958 Tsutakawa {{was asked}} to design and build a {{fountain}} for the new main branch of the public library being built in downtown Seattle. He accepted, although he had never created a fountain before. After two years of daunting mishaps, he and Jack Uchida, a Boeing engineer who would become his lifelong technical expert and assistant, finished Fountain of Wisdom, a tall silicon bronze abstract design suggestive of obos, totem poles, and pagodas. Artist, public, and critics were all delighted with the work, whose fusion of Asian, Native American, and modern Abstract Expressionist elements was deeply evocative of the Pacific Northwest. <b>Almost</b> <b>by</b> happenstance, Tsutakawa had found a new medium for his artistic energies.|$|E

25|$|It {{was under}} these auspices that the grapevine {{followed}} land prospector John Howe as he cut {{a path through}} the Australian wilderness from Sydney up to the overland area in what is now known as the (Lower) Hunter Valley proper in 1820. Today, the modern Putty Road between the cities of Windsor and Singleton follows Howe's exact path and is a major thoroughfare for wine tourists coming into the Hunter Valley from Sydney. As previous plantings in the coastal areas around Sydney succumbed to the humidity and wetness, and plantings to the west were limited by spring frost damage, northern reaches leading to the Hunter became, <b>almost</b> <b>by</b> default, the wine region of the new colony.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{elections}} were called, the Social Liberal Party stated that they supported a government led by the Social Democrats. The Red-Green Alliance support a left-wing government <b>almost</b> <b>by</b> default. The Socialist People's Party also support a left-wing government, and have stated that they wish to not only support such a government but {{to be a part}} of it. In spite of a dramatic increase in support of the Socialist People's Party in opinion polls, these four parties never stood to get enough seats in parliament to head a government. Consequently, prior to the election, Helle Thorning-Schmidt (the leader of the Social Democrats) invited both New Alliance and the Conservative People's Party to participate in a centre-left government, but both parties have refused.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Chickamauga opened <b>almost</b> <b>by</b> accident, when pickets from Col. Daniel McCook's brigade of Granger's Reserve Corps {{moved toward}} Jay's Mill In search of water. McCook {{had moved from}} Rossville on September 18 to aid Col. Robert Minty's brigade. His men {{established}} a defensive position several hundred yards northwest of Jay's Mill, about equally distant from where the 1st Georgia Cavalry waited through the night south of the mill. At {{about the time that}} McCook sent a regiment to destroy Reed's Bridge (which would survive the second attempt in two days to destroy it), Brig. Gen. Henry Davidson of Forrest's Cavalry Corps sent the 1st Georgia forward and they encountered some of McCook's men near the mill. McCook was ordered by Granger to withdraw back to Rossville and his men were pursued by Davidson's troopers. McCook encountered Thomas at the LaFayette Road, having finished an all-night march from Crawfish Springs. McCook reported to Thomas that a single Confederate infantry brigade was trapped {{on the west side of}} Chickamauga Creek. Thomas told Brannan's division to attack and destroy it.|$|E
