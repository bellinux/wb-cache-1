5|$|Die <b>Another</b> <b>Day,</b> {{produced}} by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, {{and directed by}} Lee Tamahori, marked the James Bond franchise's 40th anniversary.

5|$|After the September 11 attacks, Madonna {{was in an}} introspective {{mood and}} started writing songs for her next studio album, American Life, with {{producer}} Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Recording started in late 2001 but was put on hold as Madonna shot for her film Swept Away in Malta, and also starred in the West End play, Up For Grabs. In the meantime, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) was filming the twentieth James Bond film, Die <b>Another</b> <b>Day,</b> directed by Lee Tamahori. The previous film in the franchise, The World Is Not Enough (1999) was a box office success earning US$362 million worldwide. However, the eponymous soundtrack single by alternative rock group Garbage failed to gain commercial success in the United States. The music management at MGM went {{to look for a}} high-profile artist to write and perform the title song for Die <b>Another</b> <b>Day.</b>|$|E
5|$|Die <b>Another</b> <b>Day</b> had {{its world}} premiere on 18 November 2002 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were guests of honour, {{making it the}} second Bond film premiere to be {{attended}} by the Queen, the first one being You Only Live Twice in 1967. The Royal Albert Hall had a make-over for the screening and had been transformed into an ice palace. Proceeds from the première, about £500,000, were donated to the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund of which the Queen is patron. On the first day, ticket sales reached £1.2 million. Die <b>Another</b> <b>Day</b> was the highest grossing James Bond film until the release of Casino Royale. It earned $432 million worldwide, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of 2002.|$|E

5|$|A running joke {{throughout}} the film series is Moneypenny's unrequited love for Bond and his playful flirting with her. She flirts back, jokes and sometimes pouts, hoping to wrangle a proposal and {{a wedding ring}} out of him. A fantasy sequence in Die <b>Another</b> <b>Day</b> marks the only occasion in the Eon film series in which Moneypenny was actually shown in a romantic embrace with Bond, although this is only in Q-branch's virtual reality machine.|$|E
5|$|Dr. No also {{establishes}} the oft-repeated association (in this case, Project Mercury) between the Bond series and the US manned space programme—which would be repeated with Project Gemini in You Only Live Twice, Project Apollo in Diamonds Are Forever, {{and the space}} shuttle in Moonraker (not to mention several outer space sequences involving fictional satellite programmes in GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, and Die <b>Another</b> <b>Day).</b>|$|E
5|$|From Thunderball {{through to}} Die <b>Another</b> <b>Day,</b> the gun barrel {{sequence}} segues into the pre-title sequence {{by having the}} opening shot be sighted through the barrel.

The sequence for The World Is Not Enough is unusually long: at over fourteen minutes it is {{two to three times}} the length of most others.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the early}} schools in Eccles was the 18th century day school in the parish of St. Mary's, south of the Irwell on the de Trafford estate.

Despite the obviously frustrating content, Urquhart knew there was little other choice and radioed Thomas at 08:00 to agree to the plan on the condition it went ahead that night. Meanwhile, the Airborne forces would need to endure <b>another</b> <b>day</b> in their perimeter. More men were evacuated from the aid posts throughout the day, but there was no official truce and this was sometimes done under fire.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Die <b>Another</b> <b>Day,</b> the media began {{questioning}} whether or not Brosnan would reprise the role for a fifth time. At that time, Brosnan was approaching his 50th birthday. Brosnan kept in mind that both fans and critics were very unhappy with Roger Moore playing the role until he (Moore) was 58, but he was receiving popular support from both critics and the franchise fanbase for a fifth instalment. For this reason, he remained enthusiastic about reprising his role.|$|E
5|$|Starting with From Russia with Love, the {{briefings}} with Q branch involve various gadgets and technology, although Boothroyd is not {{referred to}} in the credits as Q until the third film, Goldfinger.

5|$|The Catholic Church teaches that, {{immediately}} after death, {{the soul of}} each person will receive a particular judgement from God, based on their sins {{and their relationship to}} Christ.
