40|$|This study {{investigates the}} extent to which {{arrangements}} concluded between European institutions contribute to the separation of powers underlying the European Union’s political system. The point of departure is an analysis of different separation of powers models. The author posits that the European Union’s political system is best interpreted against the background of a ‘separation of institutions’, implying that no European institution should exercise its legal powers in an unchecked manner. This approach builds on the Court of Justice’ institutional balance doctrine. It differs from the more traditional constitutional law theory known as ‘trias politica’ according to which no government authority ought to combine two ‘governmental functions’. Seen from this perspective, separation of powers is a matter of autonomous institutions subject to ‘checks and balances’. Some checks and balances find their basis in EU law. However, many others are based on arrangements between the European institutions. Many of such arrangements are not based on law. An enquiry into the possible general legal bases for such interinstitutional agreements finds all of them unsound. Driessen argues that interinstitutional arrangements without a legal basis (‘interinstitutional conventions’) cannot be legally enforceable. Although there are differences, to a certain extent they can be equated to the ‘constitutional conventions’ known in British constitutional law. An analysis of such interinstitutional conventions suggests their omnipresence in European constitutional practice. The study analyses the effects of interinstitutional arrangements on different fields of EU law. This includes, inter alia, an analysis of the political responsibility of the Commission and of its members towards the European Parliament, of the interinstitutional conventions that govern the Parliament’s rights of oversight, and those governing legislative procedures, the budgetary procedure and external relations. The analysis shows that many interinstitutional conventions are important instruments for the daily management of the Union. Other interinstitutional conventions concern the details of the relations between the institutions. They can tangibly affect the balance of influence between the European institutions. For example, in the budgetary field, the European Parliament successfully used interinstitutional agreements to ensure that about one half of expenditure is subject to its approval as non-compulsory expenditure. Additionally, it acquired some control over the remainder through the financial perspectives, which are equally based on interinstitutional conventions. Driessen researches the limitations on the use of such interinstitutional arrangements. Although they certainly cannot replace the procedures foreseen in European law, they can affect such them. Jurists often fail to notice {{the extent to}} which this happens. The study is based on current law but also takes on board the changes proposed in the Constitutional Treaty.

40|$|Masters ThesisIn this thesis, I {{examine the}} discursive {{construction}} of colonial state {{space in the}} context of British India's turn of the century North-West Frontier. My central argument is that notions of a uniform state space posited in official theorizations of the frontier need to be reexamined not as evidence of a particular kind of rule, but rather as a claim to having accomplished it. Drawing on new colonial historiographies that suggest ways of reading archives and archival documents for their silences and on historical sociological understandings of state-formation, I offer close readings of three different kinds of documents: writing about the North-West Frontier by members of the colonial administration, <b>annual</b> <b>general</b> <b>reports</b> of the Survey of India, and narratives written by colonial frontier officers detailing their time and experience of "making" the frontier. I begin by looking at the writings of George Nathanial Curzon and others attempting to theorize the concept of frontiers in turn of the century political discourse. Framed {{against the backdrop of the}} "Great Game" for empire with Russia and the progressive territorial consolidation of colonial frontiers into borders in the late 19 th century, these arguments constitute what I call a "colonial theory of frontiers. " This theory simultaneously naturalizes colonial space and presents borders as the inevitable result of colonial expansion. This theorization, I argue, is particularly important to reexamine as it operates on a set of assumptions that have been adopted into social science notions of territory. These assumptions take space as "given" and static as opposed to fluid, contingent, and contested. I explore this late colonial theory of frontiers as "claims" to territorial rule by looking at the discourse of cartography {{in the context of}} the North-West Frontier. Cartography, like colonial frontier theory, posits a uniform state space where the boundaries of rule are neatly demarcated by borders. A closer examination of maps along the North-West Frontier, however, suggests that processes of territory making in this region neither conform to simple notions of cartographic demarcation nor to colonial frontier theory more generally. Finally, I suggest that these spaces are better understood as zones of negotiation and state formation where claims of colonial territorial integrity are anything but certain. Such an understanding of territory displaces approaches that tacitly designate places as either state or non-state and demonstrates that claims to territorial control must always be understood in the context of the contingent, contested, and negotiated claims for making space into place...|$|R

40|$|IN {{the course}} of a recent study of the {{relationship}} between Welshness, indicated by the possession of a Welsh surname, and disease, it was noted that the death rate for lung cancer in men was low, S. M. R. 85, while that for bronchitis was high, S. M.

The previous investigation (Ashley and Davies, 1966) was directed to testing and disproving the hypothesis that these differences were due to an inherently greater susceptibility to bronchitis and resistance to pulmonary neoplasm among the Welsh people. The investigation did, however, suggest that the form of bronchitis seen in coal miners might be to some extent protective against carcinogenic factors reaching the lung. The present investigation extends to cover the whole of England and Wales and is based on statistics published in the Registrar <b>General's</b> <b>Annual</b> <b>Report...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Scottish Registrar <b>General's</b> <b>Annual</b> <b>Reports</b> {{have been}} used to study trends in {{mortality}} from stroke in Scotland during 1950 - 1986 in those aged 45 to 74. In 1950 the age-adjusted mortality rate was 347. 4 per 100, 000 population for men and 360. 8 for women, falling to 199. 6 for men and 155. 8 for women in 1986. This downward trend has increased from 1976 for males. The average annual decline in age-adjusted mortality from stroke over the 37 -year period was 4. 0 per 100, 000 in males and 5. 5 in females. This reduction in death rates was proportionally higher for women compared with men in all age groups over 55 years. As with cardiovascular deaths, mortality from stroke was lower in the east than in the central region and west of Scotland. The reduction in mortality resulted in a substantial 'saving' of lives, estimated at 12, 500 between 1980 and 1984. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|In August, 1963, a Disaster Research Center (DRC) was {{established}} at Ohio State University. As {{one of its}} major research activities the Center initiated for the Office of Civil Defense a study focused on organizational functioning in community disasters. An attempt was {{to be made to}} arrive at an empirically grounded understanding of the involvement, operations and problems of emergency organizations in major natural catastrophes and other extreme stress situations. The research was to be conducted chiefly through the dispatching of field teams to gather their data primarily through systematic observations and interviews. Field studies of domestic disasters were to be used to make “in-depth” i. e., intensive studies of particular organizations. Foreign disasters were to provide comparative data and to serve as opportunities to examine alternate organizational and community procedures for coping with major emergencies. Within a five year period, the Center was not only to conduct such studies, but to produce a series of publications "with special emphasis on recommendations concerning the effective emergency operations of organizations and other matters pertinent to civil defense planners. This Status Report very briefly summarizes the work undertaken in {{the first three years of}} the study, discusses the kinds of research and analyses currently being undertaken, and lists the publications scheduled to be produced by the end of the five year period (i. e., July 31, 1968). The focus is almost exclusively on the field aspects of the study. Related tasks, such as the establishment of a disaster data repository, a summarization and synthesis of the disaster literature, the carrying out of laboratory simulations of organizational stress as a. supplement to an AFOSR study, and the exploration of the possibilities of field experiments, have been discussed in the <b>annual</b> <b>general</b> summary <b>reports</b> and are not further detailed in this report...|$|R
