5|$|The {{hospital}} of Maison Dieu (the <b>Alms</b> <b>House),</b> dedicated to St Mary and situated near the cathedral precinct but outside the chanonry, {{was established by}} Bishop Andreas before 1237 for {{the aid of the}} poor. It suffered fire damage in 1390 and again in 1445. The cathedral clerks received it as a secular benefice but in later years it may, in common with other hospitals, have become dilapidated through a lack of patronage. Bishop James Hepburn granted it to the Blackfriars of Elgin on 17 November 1520, perhaps in an effort to preserve its existence. The property was taken into the ownership of the Crown after the Reformation and in 1595 was granted to the burgh by James VI for educational purposes and for helping the poor. In 1624, an almshouse was constructed to replace the original building, but in 1750 a storm substantially damaged its relatively intact ruins. The remnants of the original building were finally demolished during a 19th-century redevelopment of the area.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Highway Administration {{approved}} the Georgetown Area Environmental Assessment with a Finding of No Significant Impact in 2014. As with the Ellendale area, DelDOT plans to upgrade US 113 along its present alignment from south of Avenue of Honor north of Millsboro to south of Redden Road. Interchanges are planned near Piney Grove Road and Avenue of Honor north of Millsboro; at Governor Stockley Road at Stockley; near Speedway Road, <b>Alms</b> <b>House</b> Road, and Kruger Road north of Stockley; at Shortly Road and South Bedford Street {{on the southern}} edge of Georgetown; at Arrow Safety Road in Georgetown; at US 9 in Georgetown; at DE 18 and DE 404 in Georgetown; and at Wilson Road north of Georgetown. The U.S. Highway's intersection with DE 18 and DE 404 has the highest crash rate and the highest level of traffic congestion in the study area, so that intersection will be replaced with an interchange first. US 113 will be expanded to six lanes throughout the corridor, and right-in/right-out access to adjoining businesses would be maintained, with efforts {{to reduce the number of}} contact points.|$|E
25|$|As a philanthropist, Mutty Lall Seal founded an <b>alms</b> <b>house</b> at Belgharia (in {{the suburbs}} of Calcutta) in 1841 where on an average five hundred people were fed daily and which is even now open {{to the poor and}} a bathing ghat {{on the bank of the}} Hooghly River known as Motilal Ghat which still exists.|$|E

25|$|The other {{buildings}} {{related to the}} cathedral are the free-standing bell-tower of the early 15th century, probably the work of William Wynford who also designed the cloisters, with openings in the Perpendicular style. St Mary's Almshouses in Chichester, which {{are linked to the}} cathedral, are a Christian charity dating from the 13th century. The medieval Hospital, associated with the <b>Alms</b> <b>House,</b> is one of only two such buildings in the world, the other being in Germany.|$|E
25|$|A workhouse {{was built}} at {{the east end of}} the town in 1835, and was the {{responsibility}} of the Glanford Brigg Poor Law Union. Its architect was William Adams Nicholson who also designed the similar building in Lincoln, and replaced an earlier <b>alms</b> <b>house</b> dating back to 1701. The workhouse at Brigg {{is one of the best}} known and best documented of its type, probably because of the national interest that arose after Percy Grainger collected traditional songs from the inmates. An infirmary was later built attached to the workhouse, and this portion remained open as a hospital until 1991.|$|E
25|$|Much of the borough's present {{land was}} {{occupied}} by Angelica Farm which would be established as an almshouse, or poorhouse, in 1824. The <b>alms</b> <b>house</b> was replaced by Bern Township's Berks Heim in 1952. The buildings of the Governor Mifflin School District now occupy most of land that was once part of the almshouse. Today, the most notable visible remnant of the poorhouse is a stone wall that is within short walking distance {{down the road from}} John Updike's old home. Updike's first novel, The Poorhouse Fair, is set in a fictional building based on Shillington's poorhouse. Angelica Farm was also the historical home of Thomas Mifflin, the first governor of Pennsylvania and 11th President of the Continental Congress.|$|E

25|$|In 1460, Sir Thomas {{built the}} great Old Hall in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. Gainsborough Old Hall {{was not only}} their home, but also a {{demonstration}} of their wealth and importance. Sir Thomas was a great benefactor to Newark Church and also {{the founder of the}} Chantry and <b>Alms</b> <b>House</b> at Gainsborough. In 1470, the manor was attacked by Sir Robert Welles over a clash about lands, status, and honour, but it was not severely damaged. It was in 1484 that Sir Thomas entertained King Richard III in his hall. Today, the Hall with its elaborate timber roof survives as well as the kitchenâ€”possibly the most complete medieval kitchen in England. The Hall is over five hundred years old {{and one of the best}} preserved medieval manor houses in England.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 June 1864 Union forces {{under the}} command of General David Hunter shelled and burned the Institute as part of the Valley Campaigns of 1864. The {{destruction}} was almost complete and VMI had to temporarily hold classes at the <b>Alms</b> <b>House</b> in Richmond, Virginia. In April 1865 Richmond was evacuated due to the impending fall of Petersburg and the VMI Corps of Cadets was disbanded. The Lexington campus reopened for classes on 17 October 1865. One of the reasons that Confederate General Jubal A. Early burned the town of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania was in retaliation for the shelling of VMI. Following the war, Matthew Fontaine Maury, the pioneering oceanographer known as the [...] "Pathfinder of the Seas", accepted a teaching position at VMI, holding the physics chair. [...] Following the war, David Hunter Strother, who was chief of staff to General Hunter and had advised the destruction of the Institute, served as Adjutant General of the Virginia Militia and member of the VMI Board of Visitors; in that position he promoted and worked actively for the reconstruction.|$|E
60|$|There {{was little}} sense in {{standing}} on the shore discussing the danger, therefore we set off at once across the Common as if headed for the Bridewell, until we were come to within an hundred yards of it, when we left the <b>Alms</b> <b>house</b> on our right, going over Beacon hill and thence across to the mill pond. It was a roundabout way to gain Salem street, where Silas Brownrigg lived; {{but it seemed to}} me the safest, although even by such a course we twice narrowly escaped the patrol, saving ourselves by taking refuge first in a garden, and then by sneaking behind Master Mountford's house.|$|E

All the men and maids of the house, the old women of the <b>Alms</b> <b>House,</b> whom the elder Sir Pitt had cheated out of a great portion of their due, the parish clerk's family, and the special retainers of both Hall and Rectory were habited in sable; added to these, the undertaker's men, at least a score, with crapes and hatbands, and who made goodly show when the great burying show took place--but these are mute personages in our drama; and having nothing to do or say, need occupy a very little space here.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Alms</b> <b>House</b> (or County Poor House) was {{established}} in 1837, at Viola (then known as Mechanicsville) {{in the town of}} Ramapo, for the poor and destitute (debtors). It was located 7 mi west of New City. Rockland County had purchased the 47 acre parsonage farm of the Kakiat (West New Hempstead) Dutch Reformed Church (also known as the Brick Church) for use as an <b>alms</b> <b>house.</b> There the county originally built a wooden frame house to serve the poor. The inmates contributed to their upkeep by tending the farm. In 1883, a brick building was constructed. The facility included a school for the children. In 1957, the <b>Alms</b> <b>House</b> was moved to Building [...] "C" [...] at the Pomona Health Center in Summit Park, and the property would become the site of Rockland Community College. The <b>Alms</b> <b>House</b> was renamed the Rockland County Infirmary and Home. In 1977, it was removed to Building [...] "A". It has been renamed the Summit Park Nursing Care Center. The old brick <b>Alms</b> <b>House</b> building remains as an administration building (Daniel T. Brucker Hall), used by Rockland Community College. The farm lands are the campus. The Poor Cemetery (Potter's Field) remains on the RCC campus, along with the original Gary Onderdonk Veterans' Cemetery.|$|E

50|$|Tapton Hall, Derbyshire (not to be {{confused}} with Tapton Hall, Sheffield). In 1638 the lordship of Tapton with a capital messuage known as Tapton Hall was sold by Durant Allsopp and Thomas Allsopp, gentlemen, also of Durant Hall, Holy Well Street, Chesterfield, to George Taylor (d.1668) of London, Vintner, with closes (fields) at Brimington with several other properties including Durant Hall. Taylor left instructions in his will for the founding of <b>alms</b> <b>houses,</b> and 6 <b>alms</b> <b>houses</b> were duly erected in 1678 in Salter Gate, by his son-in-law Charles Scrimshire, as the inscription in the centre of the buildings attests. It was inherited by Taylor's daughter and sole-heiress Esther Taylor, who married Sir Charles Scrimshire of Norbury in Staffordshire, Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1698. It was then acquired in 1701, with Durant Hall, by Thomas Gladwin, a member of the Gladwin family of Tupton Hall and descended via his co-heiress to the Clarke family and thence to the Cox family, and in 1746 was sold, with Durant Hall, and with the manor and lordship of Tapton, by William Coxe to Adam Slater of Chesterfield, apothecary.|$|R
