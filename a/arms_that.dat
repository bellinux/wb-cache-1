5|$|Home Army {{arms and}} {{equipment}} came mostly from four sources: <b>arms</b> <b>that</b> {{had been buried}} by the Polish armies on battlefields after the 1939 invasion of Poland; arms purchased or captured from the Germans and their allies; arms clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army itself; and arms received from Allied air drops.|$|E
5|$|Later {{studies with}} the help of the Spitzer Space Telescope showed how Andromeda Galaxy's spiral {{structure}} in the infrared appears to be composed of two spiral <b>arms</b> <b>that</b> emerge from a central bar and continue beyond the large ring mentioned above. Those arms, however, are not continuous and have a segmented structure.|$|E
5|$|Most starfish {{have five}} <b>arms</b> <b>that</b> radiate from a central disc, {{but the number}} varies with the group. Luidia ciliaris has seven arms, members of the Solasteridae have ten to fifteen while the Antarctic Labidiaster annulatus can have up to fifty. It is not unusual in species that {{typically}} have five arms for some individuals to possess six or more through abnormal development.|$|E

5|$|The stinkhorn species Clathrus columnatus {{somewhat}} resembles P.fusiformis {{in that it}} has 3 or 4 <b>arms</b> <b>that</b> extend upwards {{and join}} at the top. However, unlike C.columnatus, the arms of P.fusiformis share a common stem, and the immature egg-form is gray or grayish brown, rather than white.|$|E
5|$|The three-minute ride {{features}} 32 suspended twin seats (64 seats altogether) {{spinning around}} a central tower. A lighting package was installed {{on all four}} WindSeekers, consisting of strips of LED lights mounted on the <b>arms</b> <b>that</b> support the swings and (except at Knott's Berry Farm) colored floodlights to illuminate towers from above.|$|E
5|$|A {{spiral galaxy}} is {{organized}} into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or {{bar at the}} center, and trailing bright <b>arms</b> <b>that</b> spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the Milky Way {{and one of our}} nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies.|$|E

5|$|A.coccinea {{closely resembles}} A.arachnoidea, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} from the latter by its bright red arms, and its larger spores (4–5 by 2.5–3μm in A.coccinea compared with 2.5–3.5 by 1.5μm in A.arachnoidea). A.arachnoidea is known from Asia and West Africa. A.rubra is a relatively common pantropical species, and differs from A.coccinea in its reddish receptacle (compared with pink to cream-colored in A.coccinea) and bifurcating <b>arms</b> <b>that</b> are typically multichambered.|$|E

5|$|In {{the center}} of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is {{believed}} to be a supermassive black hole at its center. This is surrounded by four primary <b>arms</b> <b>that</b> spiral from the core. This is a region of active star formation that contains many younger, population I stars. The disk is surrounded by a spheroid halo of older, population II stars, as well as relatively dense concentrations of stars known as globular clusters.|$|E

These arms appear on his tombstone in the King's Chapel Burying Ground. It is also the coat of arms for Winthrop House at Harvard University and is displayed on the 1675 house of his youngest son Deane Winthrop at the Deane Winthrop House. The heraldic blazon of arms is Argent three chevronels Gules overall a lion rampant Sable.|$|E
5|$|On May 4 Peng's forces {{attacked}} {{an isolated}} supply depot in northeast Shaanxi, arrested its commander, and captured food reserves, 40,000 army uniforms, {{and a collection}} of <b>arms</b> <b>that</b> included over a million pieces of artillery. Peng's forces were pushed back to the border of Inner Mongolia, but finally managed to decisively defeat Hu's forces in August, in the Battle of Shajiadian(沙家店战役), saving Mao and other members from the Central committee from being taken prisoner. Peng eventually pushed Kuomintang forces out of Shaanxi in February 1948.|$|E
5|$|One day at Emain Macha, Cú Chulainn overhears Cathbad {{teaching}} his pupils. One {{asks him}} what that day is auspicious for, and Cathbad replies that any warrior who takes <b>arms</b> <b>that</b> day will have everlasting fame. Cú Chulainn, though only seven years old, goes to Conchobar {{and asks for}} arms. None of the weapons given to him withstand his strength, until Conchobar gives him his own weapons. But when Cathbad sees this he grieves, because he had not finished his prophecy—the warrior who took <b>arms</b> <b>that</b> day would be famous, but his life would be short. Soon afterwards, {{in response to a}} similar prophecy by Cathbad, Cú Chulainn demands a chariot from Conchobar, and only the king's own chariot withstands him. He sets off on a foray and kills the three sons of Nechtan Scéne, who had boasted they had killed more Ulstermen than there were Ulstermen still living. He returns to Emain Macha in his battle frenzy, and the Ulstermen are afraid he will slaughter them all. Conchobar's wife Mugain leads out the women of Emain, and they bare their breasts to him. He averts his eyes, and the Ulstermen wrestle him into a barrel of cold water, which explodes from the heat of his body. They put him in a second barrel, which boils, and a third, which warms to a pleasant temperature.|$|E

5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann. The new unit could be fitted with five or six gears and was tall and narrow, allowing a clearer airflow from under {{the car to the}} rear, with the intent of improving the ground effect. An alternative rear suspension layout was designed to go with this gearbox. It replaced the standard pullrods with rocker <b>arms</b> <b>that</b> activated vertical coil springs mounted behind the gearbox. The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put to one side.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of April 23, 1998 a band of Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) fighters was ambushed by a much smaller group of Yugoslav Army (VJ) border guards near the Košare outpost, just west of Dečani. The fighters {{had been trying to}} smuggle weapons and {{supplies}} into Kosovo via northern Albania. Nineteen were killed in the ensuing attack, and a further two were captured. The VJ did not sustain any casualties. Some of the militants retreated back to Albania, while others managed to break through the ambush and make it past the Yugoslav border, into Kosovo. Following the clash, the VJ confiscated a large quantity of <b>arms</b> <b>that</b> the militants had been transporting.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Japan was defeated, the {{communist}} fighters renamed themselves the Malayan National Liberation Army, {{and began to}} agitate against British rule. Using the <b>arms</b> <b>that</b> Britain had given them—which they had cached, and then subsequently retrieved—they formed themselves into eight regiments, and began a campaign of Maoist-style rural subversion, their intent being to politicise the villagers and gain popular support, which they could then use {{to take control of}} Malayan cities. In March 1948, the MCP called on the Malayan people to rise up against the British. Three months later, on 16 June, MNLA guerrillas killed three British rubber plantation managers in Perak province. The British High Commissioner in Malaya, Sir Edward Gent, {{declared a state of emergency}} two days afterwards, marking the beginning of the Malayan Emergency.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinctive}} dromaeosaurid {{body plan}} helped to rekindle theories {{that at least}} some dinosaurs may have been active, fast, and closely related to birds. Robert Bakker's illustration for John Ostrom's 1969 monograph, showing the dromaeosaurid Deinonychus in a fast run, is among the most influential paleontological reconstructions in history. The dromaeosaurid body plan includes a relatively large skull, serrated teeth, narrow snout, and forward-facing eyes which indicate some degree of binocular vision. Dromaeosaurids, like most other theropods, had a moderately long S-curved neck, and their trunk was relatively short and deep. Like other maniraptorans, they had long <b>arms</b> <b>that</b> could be folded against the body in some species, and relatively large hands with three long fingers (the middle finger being the longest and the first finger being the shortest) ending in large claws. The dromaeosaurid hip structure featured a characteristically large pubic boot projecting beneath the base of the tail. Dromaeosaurid feet bore a large, recurved claw on the second toe. Their tails were slender, with long, low, vertebrae lacking transverse process and neural spines after the 14th caudal vertebra.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} flag of Ecuador, {{which consists of}} horizontal bands of yellow (double width), blue and red, was first adopted by law in 1835 and later on 26 September 1860. The design of the current flag was finalized in 1900 {{with the addition of}} the coat of arms {{in the center of the}} flag. Before using the yellow, blue and red tricolor, Ecuador used white and blue flags that contained stars for each province of the country. The design of the flag is very similar to those of Colombia and Venezuela, which are also former constituent territories of Gran Colombia. All three are based on a proposal by Venezuelan General Francisco de Miranda, which was adopted by Venezuela in 1811 and later Gran Colombia with some modifications. There is a variant of the flag that does not contain the coat of <b>arms</b> <b>that</b> is used by the merchant marine. This flag matches Colombia's in every aspect, but Colombia uses a different design when her merchant marine ships are at sail.|$|E
5|$|The octopus is bilaterally {{symmetrical}} {{along its}} dorso-ventral axis; {{the head and}} foot are {{at one end of}} an elongated body and function as the anterior (front) of the animal. The head includes the mouth and brain. The foot has evolved into a set of flexible, prehensile appendages, known as <b>arms,</b> <b>that</b> surround the mouth and are attached to each other near their base by a webbed structure. The arms can be described based on side and sequence position (such as L1, R1, L2, R2) and divided into four pairs. The bulbous and hollow mantle is fused {{to the back of the}} head and is known as the visceral hump; it contains most of the vital organs. The mantle cavity has muscular walls and contains the gills; it is connected to the exterior by a funnel or siphon. The mouth of an octopus, located underneath the arms, has a sharp hard beak.|$|E

50|$|The {{stiffness}} of a limb {{is dependent on}} its configuration or joint arrangement. For example, an <b>arm</b> <b>that</b> is slightly bent, it will deform more easily under a force directed from the hand to the shoulder than an <b>arm</b> <b>that</b> is straight. In this way, the {{stiffness of}} a limb is partially dictated by the limb's posture. This component of limb stiffness {{is due to the}} mechanics of the limb and is controlled voluntarily.|$|R
