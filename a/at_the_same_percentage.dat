40|$|BACKGROUND: Defects in APC and {{regulatory}} cells {{are associated with}} diabetes development in NOD mice. We have shown previously that NOD APC are not effective at stimulating CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) regulatory cell function in vitro. We hypothesize that failure of NOD APC to properly activate CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) regulatory cells in vivo could compromise their ability to control pathogenic cells, and activation of NOD APC could restore this defect, thereby preventing disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To test these hypotheses, we used the well-documented ability of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), an APC activator, to prevent disease in NOD mice. Phenotype and function of CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) regulatory cells from untreated and CFA-treated NOD mice were determined by FACS, and in vitro and in vivo assays. APC from these mice were also evaluated {{for their ability to}} activate regulatory cells in vitro. We have found that sick NOD CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) cells expressed Foxp 3 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>percentages,</b> but decreased levels per cell, compared to young NOD or non-NOD controls. Treatment with CFA increased Foxp 3 expression in NOD cells, and also increased the percentages of CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) Foxp 3 (+) cells infiltrating the pancreas compared to untreated NOD mice. Moreover, CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) cells from pancreatic LN of CFA-treated, but not untreated, NOD mice transferred protection from diabetes. Finally, APC isolated from CFA-treated mice increased Foxp 3 and granzyme B expression as well as regulatory function by NOD CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) cells in vitro compared to APC from untreated NOD mice.

In 14 healthy subjects (ten males, four females, age 31 +/- 10 SD) we studied the ventilatory, cardiovascular and gas exchange adaptations during two incremental cycle ergometer exercise: (F) fast work rate increments (30 - 20 watt/min, M-F), (S) slow work rate increments (15 - 10 watt/min, M-F).

A tension fatigue life prediction methodology based on a through-thickness damage accumulation model is used to predict the fatigue failure of composite coupon specimens. Its applicability to thin-walled cylindrical specimens is in-vestigated by comparing the fatigue behavior of composite coupon specimens to that of composite thin-walled cylindrical specimens. AS 4 / 3501 - 6 graphite-epoxy coupon speci-mens and thin-walled cylinder specimens with the same layup sequence of [0 / &plusmn; 45 / 90] were tested under static and fatigue loading conditions. Reasonably good agreement is found between the measured and predicted lives of the coupon specimens.

In this report, the ECE R 49 13 -mode engine test cycle was performed on a heavy-duty diesel engine. Unlike the usual ECE R 49 13 -mode sample method, PM in the exhaust was separately sampled in this research under every test mode. Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in the exhaust were also measured. Soluble organic fraction (SOF) and insoluble fraction (ISF) of the PM were partitioned with an ultrasonic elution, and then every SOF sample was analysed by combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The results show that the mass flux of PM increases with increasing engine loads, and there is an exponential growth function between the PM mass flux and the engine power under the same engine speed. Concerning the engine’s NOx emissions, there is an exponential decay function between the con-centration of NOx and engine power. By comparing the results obtained, the effects of load and speed on the contents of ISF and SOF in PM were observed. The percentages of ISF and SOF contents in PM are markedly changed with the load, but are less influenced by the speed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>percentage</b> of load. The dominant component in SOF is paraffin hydrocarbon and second is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). The percentage of PAH content in PM is higher at lower loads.

Res. 18 (4) : 000 - 000. 2004. —The {{purpose of this}} investigation was to compare the performance-enhancing effects of squats on a vibration platform with conventional squats in recreationally resistance-trained men. The subjects were 14 re-creationally resistance-trained men (age, 21 – 40 years) and the intervention period consisted of 5 weeks. After the initial test-ing, subjects were randomly assigned to either the ‘‘squat whole body vibration’ ’ (SWBV) group (n 5 7), which performed squats on a vibration platform on a Smith Machine, or the ‘‘squat’’(S) group (n 5 7), which performed conventional squats with no vi-brations on a Smith Machine. Testing was performed at the be-ginning {{and the end of the}} study and consisted of 1 repetition maximum (1 RM) in squat and maximum jump height in coun-termovement jump (CMJ). A modified daily undulating period-ization program was used during the intervention period in both groups. Both groups trained <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>percentage</b> of 1 RM in squats (6 – 10 RM). After the intervention, CMJ performance in-creased significantly only in the SWBV (p, 0. 01), but there was no significant difference between groups in relative jump height increase (p 5 0. 088). Both groups showed significant increases in 1 RM performance in squats (p, 0. 01).
