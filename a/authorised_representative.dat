500|$|Bird's {{career in}} the Cabinet was ended by scandal in 1990 after a {{shipment}} of Israeli weapons to Antigua and Barbuda were received and then diverted to the Medellín Cartel of Colombian drug dealers. The scandal broke after the Colombian government publicly complained {{about the use of}} Antigua and Barbuda as a trans-shipment point; a diplomatic note from the Israeli government revealed that the weapons had been shipped at the apparent express instruction of Bird, who had given assurances {{that they would not be}} passed on to any third parties. The guns were actually ordered as part of a conspiracy by Maurice Sarfati and Yair Klein, who forged documents showing that Sarfati was an <b>authorised</b> <b>representative</b> of the Antiguan government and that the purchase of weapons had been approved by the Antiguan Minister for National Security, though that position did not exist. The plan was to set up a mercenary training camp on Antigua in order to train and supply Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha's Medellin forces. The Prime Minister repeatedly refused to open an investigation, despite demands by community leaders and members of his own government, saying that [...] "conclusive evidence" [...] was needed. An investigation was finally ordered on 25 April, with Bird asking to be temporarily relieved of his position until the inquiry concluded.|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this review}} is to explore the legal, ethical, and rights issues {{surrounding}} use of the Australian My Health Record (MyHR) by people with communication disability. Method: A narrative review of the legislation and research affecting the implementation of MyHR in populations with communication disability. Results: Use of MyHR by people with communication disability will require careful consideration in relation to: (a) capacity and consent, (b) roles of nominated or <b>authorised</b> <b>representatives</b> in the system, and (c) the way decisions are made in relation to use of MyHR, including supported decision-making for people with intellectual disability. Conclusion: Legal and ethical issues in use of MyHR by people with communication disability centre on legal rights and equal access. These issues must be addressed if people with communication disability are to have full access to their legal rights and access in exercising personal choice and control {{in the use of}} MyHR.

40|$|Modern tourism expands through {{cultural}} experience, {{which is}} reflected in economic, ecological and socio-cultural effects on destinations. Event tourism is a growing market segment and represents a challenge for all destination stakeholders. As the largest town in the Croatian part of Istria, the City of Pula represents a valid basis {{for the development of}} event tourism due to its coastal geography and rich cultural and historical heritage from antique, medieval and new age periods. The festival and event organisers in Pula use historical and cultural themes in order to develop annual attractions by which they draw in tourists and brand the destination. In this paper, the hypothesis is set on the lack of benefits from event organisation in the destination (the City of Pula) in the ecological, economic and socio-cultural senses. In resolving of research problems with <b>authorised</b> <b>representatives</b> of local boards Arena, Monte Zaro and Stinjan, standardised, semi-structured and problem-centred interviews were conducted for the purposes of contribution to research relative to sustainability and responsibility of events in tourism...|$|R
40|$|The final study {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of one part of Controlling - Internal Inspection - in the selected contributory educational organizations. Is based on general information regarding the subject stated in literature and on the analysis of actual situation in the cooperating non profit organisations. By targeted investigation carried out in specific school organizations I found out that all managers contacted by me were performing internal inspection. Mostly, though, they have been performing the inspection of the individual areas isolatedly without any systematic considerations. From my investigation {{it is obvious that}} managers (<b>authorised</b> <b>representatives</b> of the organizations or their deputies) who have completed some form of further education of pedagogical personnel focused on management are better oriented in the relevant issues. In my thesis, I suggest a systematic approach towards the internal inspection that takes into account mutual relations. It may be implemented in the conditions of all types of schools. This should bring higher efficientcy in the whole management system and easier competitiveness in the market of schools...|$|R

40|$|Objectives The {{objectives}} of the study are to understand the current practice of informed consent in medical research in public hospitals in Shanghai, and to share our views with other countries, especially developing countries. Methods In the study, 145 consent forms (CFs) of the selected research projects in eight public hospitals with ethics committees in Shanghai were audited, and the principle investigators (PIs) of these research projects and 40 student subjects {{who had participated in}} clinical drug tests were surveyed by questionnaires. Results The CFs of medical researches in public hospitals with ethics committees in Shanghai were generally acceptable. However, there were some defects in the CFs. Although most of the surveyed PIs had correct recognition of informed consent, some processes of informed consent were not in accordance with generally accepted requirements. A large number of the PIs considered the greatest difficulty with informal consent was lack of correct recognition of subjects or legally <b>authorised</b> <b>representatives</b> on medical research. Discussion Informed consent in medical research should consider the research ethics, the background of potential subjects, the local resources and culture of medical research. In addition, special protection is needed for student subjects in informed consent as well as efforts for building and restoring the public’s trust in biomedical research. Conclusion The informed consent in Shanghai’s public hospitals with ethics committees was generally acceptable and the achievement of adequate informed consent is influenced by many factors...|$|R
