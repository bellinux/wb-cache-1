25|$|On 12 August 2015, Mordechai Vanunu and {{his wife}} applied for family reunification via the Norwegian embassy in Tel Aviv.

25|$|Paramilitaries, {{including}} the Zetas, have now entered uncharted territories. They protect not only drug cartels but also many other financially profitable {{industries such as}} oil, gas, kidnapping, and counterfeiting electronics. There has been a complete and total loss of control {{by the government and}} the only response has been to increase army presence, notably an army whose officials are often paid off or <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> the drug cartels payroll. The United States has stepped in to offer support in the “war on drugs” by the way of funding, American training and military support, and transforming the Mexican judicial system to parallel the American system.|$|E

He directs the clean-cut, smug Omega president Greg Marmalard {{to find a way}} for him {{to remove the}} Deltas from campus. Various incidents, including the prank-related accidental death of a horse belonging to Omega member and ROTC cadet commander Douglas Neidermeyer, and an attempt by Otter to date Marmalard's girlfriend further increase the Dean's and the Omegas' animosity toward the Deltas.|$|E

[...] Henrys dispatched Garnier-Duplessix's Groupe Mobile to Khénifra from El Graar and ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Dérigoin to form another Groupe at Ito for mobile support. [...] Garnier-Duplessix was forced to fight his way through groups of Zaian tribesmen and did not reach the town until 16 November. [...] Henrys joined Dérigoin and entered the town himself two days later, encountering no resistance on the way. [...] Another part of the Khénifra relief force was the 6th battalion of the 2nd French Foreign Legion who marched from Mrirt and saw action at El Hammam and along the Oum er Rbia. [...] By the end of the month the French garrison had swelled to 7,000 troops, an all-time high. [...] Henrys, Garnier-Duplessix and Kroll were all promoted shortly after the battle in recognition of their actions to prevent the loss of Khénifra.|$|E

2500|$|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a {{class of}} {{diseases}} that involve the heart or blood vessels. As the event rate is higher in men than in women, the decrease in events is more easily seen in men than women. In those at risk, but without a history of cardiovascular disease (primary prevention), statins decrease {{the risk of death}} and combined fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease. A United States guideline recommends statins in those who have a 12% or greater risk of cardiovascular disease over the next ten years. [...] Niacin, fibrates and CETP Inhibitors, while they may increase HDL cholesterol do not affect the risk of cardiovascular disease in those who <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> statins.|$|E
