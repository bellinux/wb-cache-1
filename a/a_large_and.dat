5|$|A heavy chick {{mortality}} at <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> important {{colony of}} the magnificent frigatebird, located on Île du Grand Connétable off French Guiana, {{was recorded in}} summer 2005.

5|$|Although only an {{alternate}} {{member of the}} tribunal without a vote, his voice was heard {{in all of its}} deliberations, his hand drafted <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> most important part of its judgment, and no one connected with the tribunal, member or otherwise, had a greater part than he in shaping the final result. If, as I confidently believe, the work of the tribunal will constitute a landmark in the development of world order based on law, to Norman Birkett must go a large share of the credit for the success of the undertaking. To few men does the opportunity come to labour so mightily for the welfare of their kind.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the city}} of Santa Cruz already {{exhibited}} a strong conservation ethic before {{the founding of the}} university, the coincidental rise of the counterculture of the 1960s with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development. Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to environmentalism that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area. The lowering of the voting age to 18 in 1971 led to the emergence of a powerful student-voting bloc. <b>A</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> growing population of politically liberal UCSC alumni changed the electorate of the town from predominantly Republican to markedly left-leaning, consistently voting against expansion measures {{on the part of both}} town and gown.|$|E

5|$|Approximately half of {{all known}} {{antibiotics}} interfere with the workings of a bacteria's ribosome, <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> complex biochemical machine that performs protein biosynthesis by translating messenger RNA into proteins. Macrolide antibiotics clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received a grant to study and design new antibiotics. In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it. The full structure of the ribosome was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated ribosomal proteins, as many of their functions remain largely unknown.|$|E
5|$|Born in Bagheria, Sicily, {{to father}} Carlo Sr., Aiello {{was part of}} <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> impoverished family of at least nine other {{brothers}} and multiple cousins. His mother {{died when he was}} a child. In July 1907, at age 17, Aiello emigrated to the United States to join family members already residing there. After arriving in New York City by boat, he worked a series of menial jobs in Buffalo and Utica, New York, before connecting with his father, brothers and cousins in Chicago. The family set up several businesses in both New York and Chicago, including the financially successful Aiello Brothers Bakery, and they become importers of such groceries as olive oil, cheeses and sugar.|$|E
5|$|Breeding over a huge area, the Siberian accentor has <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> {{apparently}} stable population. It {{is therefore}} evaluated {{as a species}} of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although, as a northern breeding species, it may be affected by climate change in the long term.

5|$|Carla {{spawned the}} largest hurricane-related tornado {{outbreak}} on record at the time, when 26tornadoes touched down within its circulation. However, it was overwhelmingly surpassed by Hurricane Beulah in 1967, which spawned at least 115tornadoes. Throughout its path, 43fatalities and about $325.74million in damage {{were attributed to}} Carla. Most of the impact occurred in Texas, where the storm made landfall as <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> strong Category4 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Described as <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> {{physically}} imposing {{character with}} a reputation for womanising, Le Gris was a liege man (feudal retainer) of Count Pierre d'Alençon and a favourite at his court, governing a large swathe of his liege lord's territory in addition to his own ancestral holdings. Le Gris' insistence on defending his case by chivalric trial by combat rather than opting for the safer church trial (to which as a cleric in minor orders he was entitled) attracted widespread support for his cause amongst the French nobility, and controversy continues to this day as to where the real guilt lies in the case.|$|E
