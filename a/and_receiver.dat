5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second half, the Terrapins kicked off to the Seminoles before both teams traded field goals. It would be the only points Maryland would muster all night. In the fourth quarter, Florida State added another field goal. On the next possession, Maryland running back Da'Rel Scott <b>and</b> <b>receiver</b> Darrius Heyward-Bey both made short runs for a first down. Scott lost his second fumble of the night on the Terrapin 43-yard line. Florida State took over and scored another touchdown. After Maryland went three-and-out, Seminoles kicker Graham Gano made his third field goal of the night.|$|E

Motley did not participate in the championship game that year, another loss to the Lions.|$|E
5|$|The MSR was an S-band passive {{electronically}} scanned array (PESA), {{unlike the}} actively scanned MAR. A PESA system cannot (normally) generate multiple signals like AESA, but {{is much less}} expensive to build because a single transmitter <b>and</b> <b>receiver</b> {{is used for the}} entire system. The same antenna array can easily be used for both transmitting and receiving, as the area behind the array is much less cluttered and has ample room for switching in spite of the large radio frequency switches needed at this level of power.|$|E

5|$|The system, {{then known}} as RDF 1.5, would require {{a large number of}} {{ground-based}} transmitters to work in an operational setting.

5|$|USB is {{a serial}} bus, using four {{shielded}} wires for the USB2.0 variant: two for power (VBUS and GND), and two for differential data signals (labelled as D+ and D− in pinouts).

D+ and D− signals are transmitted on a differential pair, providing half-duplex data transfers for USB2.0. Mini and micro connectors have their GND connections moved from pin #4 to pin #5, while their pin #4 serves as an ID pin for the On-The-Go host/client identification.|$|E
5|$|Watt {{was waiting}} for the order, and in 1938 had {{arranged}} for production of the transmitters at Metrovick and receivers at A.C. Cossor. These {{turned out to be the}} wrong products: Metrovick had been told to directly copy ("Chinese") the 1937 design by Percy Hibberd, but Bawdsey had delivered the wrong prototype to Metrovick, who copied it. The Cossor receivers were found to be unusable, weighing as much as the entire transmitter <b>and</b> <b>receiver,</b> and having sensitivity about half that of the EMI lash-up.|$|E

The prototype MAR-II was built on reclaimed land {{just west of the}} original Zeus site. MAR-II was built into a pyramid with its back half removed. Like MAR-I, to save money MAR-II would be equipped with only one set of transmitter <b>and</b> <b>receiver</b> elements, but with all the wiring in place in case it had to be upgraded in the future. Nike-X was canceled before MAR-II was complete, and the semi-completed building was instead used as a climate-controlled storage facility.|$|E

5|$|Eventually Kwajalein Island was selected, {{as it was}} 4,800miles from California, {{perfect for}} ICBMs, and already had a US Navy base with {{considerable}} housing stocks and an airstrip. The Zeus site, known as the Kwajalein Test Site, was officially established on 1 October 1960. As it grew in size, it {{eventually led to the}} entire island complex being handed over to the Army from the Navy on 1 July 1964. The site took up a considerable amount of the empty land to {{the north side of the}} airfield. The launchers were located on the far southwestern corner of the island, with the Target Tracking Radars, Missile Tracking Radars (MTRs) and various control sites and generators running along the northern side of the airfield. The ZAR transmitter <b>and</b> <b>receiver</b> were some distance away, off the northeastern edge of the airfield.|$|E
5|$|Henry Darnall died in 1711.

Carroll continued to practice law, making a small income from cases argued in the two courts where Catholics were still allowed to practice law, the chancery and prerogative courts. His speculation in mercantile enterprises also continued. Together, these made Carroll the wealthiest man in the colony by 1715, and its most prominent Catholic.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the draft, the Bears {{met with}} 37 players; 25 had private visits, 6 {{met at the}} NFL Scouting Combine, 4 met at their college's Pro Days, 3 had {{meetings}} at the Senior Bowl and the East–West Shrine Game. Iowa State's David Irving was the only player to have a workout with the team.

5|$|The Bears visited Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis to {{play the}} Rams, again without Jay Cutler. However, the Rams were also without {{starting}} quarterback Sam Bradford, and instead had Kellen Clemens as backup. The Bears had won four consecutive games against the Rams. Two rookie players the Bears' defense had to contain were running back Zac Stacy, who recorded an average of 107.7 {{yards and three touchdowns}} in the previous three games, along with ranking second among rookie running backs with 537 rushing yards; <b>and</b> <b>receiver</b> Tavon Austin, who recorded 314 yards against the Indianapolis Colts in the previous week. Additionally, the Rams' offense was ranked fourth in the NFL with 54.6 percent of yardage occurring after the catch. For the Bears' offense, Jeff Joniak wrote they needed to avoid attempting to score in the red zone; in the previous three games, the Bears had 12 drives in the red zone, but managed to score only four touchdowns, while also allowing a turnover, and was ranked 13th after scoring 55 percent. Meanwhile, the Rams had forced quarterbacks to record only a 45.8 passer rating when in the red zone, along with the second lowest completion percentage, and the third fewest completions recorded. Also, St. Louis led the league in red zone interceptions with six. Finally, the Rams led the league in overall sack percentage with 9.4, while defensive end Robert Quinn had the most knockdowns and hurries in the NFL, and was second in sacks with 12. An advantage Chicago had, however, was the second-most passing touchdowns in the NFL with 15, while Josh McCown's average gain per pass is higher than Cutler's, with a 7.47 to 7.20. The Rams also did not have the capable secondary to cover the trio of Martellus Bennett, Alshon Jeffery and Brandon Marshall.|$|E
5|$|The Packers won {{the coin}} toss, and elected to defer, meaning the Bears started {{the game with}} the ball. On the first {{possession}} of the game, the Bears offense reached {{as far as the}} Packers' eight-yard line, but ended with Robbie Gould kicking a 28-yard field goal. After the Packers punted, the Bears came close to allowing a turnover when Cutler was sacked by Peppers and fumbled, though the call was reversed. The next four drives of the game ended in scores for both teams: the Packers scored with Rodgers' 13-yard touchdown pass to James Jones, followed by the Bears reclaiming the lead in the second quarter with Matt Forte's one-yard touchdown run; the next two possessions concluded with field goals: Mason Crosby tied the game with a 37-yarder, though the Bears ended the first half with the 13–10 lead with Gould's 50-yarder. Prior to Forte's touchdown run, Gould had kicked a 27-yard field goal, but Sam Shields was offsides on the play, giving the Bears a 4th and 1, which the Bears capitalized with via Forte's one-yard run. The Bears then had two potential touchdowns nullified by Forte dropping a pass, <b>and</b> <b>receiver</b> Alshon Jeffery's touchdown was canceled by tackle Jermon Bushrod's holding penalty. The Packers also had a potential touchdown hurt by a penalty, as Rodgers had an eight-yard touchdown pass to Jones voided by holding penalties. In the second half, the Packers scored quickly with Jones' one-yard touchdown catch. The Bears responded with Gould's 44-yard field goal, but the Packers eventually scored again via Randall Cobb's five-yard touchdown catch. On Chicago's following drive, the offense drove to Green Bay's six-yard line to set up a first and goal situation. While Forte's four-yard run brought the Bears to the two, Cutler's passes to Eddie Royal, Jeffery and Royal again fell incomplete, leading to the Bears turning the ball over on downs. The Packers punted again, but the Bears failed to score when Cutler was intercepted by Matthews; the turnover set up Lacy's two-yard touchdown run to increase the score to 31–16 with 1:55 left in the game. With 34 seconds left, the Bears scored with Cutler's 24-yard touchdown pass to tight end Martellus Bennett, narrowing the margin to eight points. However, Green Bay's Davante Adams recovered the onside kick, and the Packers ran out the clock to end the game.|$|E
