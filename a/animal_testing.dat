5|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>testing,</b> {{also known}} as animal experimentation, animal {{research}} and in vivo testing, {{is the use of}} non-human animals in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study. This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments. Experimental research with animals is usually conducted in universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry. The focus of <b>animal</b> <b>testing</b> varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some question of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of applied research include testing disease treatments, breeding, defense research and toxicology, including cosmetics testing. In education, <b>animal</b> <b>testing</b> is sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses. The practice is regulated to varying degrees in different countries.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} assess {{the effect of a}} “novel” environment on the development of sensitization to the psychomotor activating effects of d -amphetamine. In the first experiment, rats with a unilateral 6 -hydroxydopamine lesion of the mesostriatal dopamine system received ten daily injections of amphetamine (2 mg/kg), either in their home cages or in novel test cages. The home and novel cages were physically identical (cylindrical transparent buckets), but one group lived and were tested in these cages, whereas the other group was transported from the stainless steel hanging cages where they lived to these novel test cages, for each test session. The first injection of amphetamine produced significantly more rotational behavior in <b>animals</b> <b>tested</b> in a novel environment than in <b>animals</b> <b>tested</b> at home. In addition, <b>animals</b> <b>tested</b> in a novel environment showed greater sensitization than <b>animals</b> <b>tested</b> at home, so {{the difference between the two}} groups was even more pronounced following the last injection. In a second experiment, locomotor activity was quantified in rats that received ten injections of either saline or 1. 5 mg/kg amphetamine, in their home cages or in a physically identical novel environment. Again, there was a significantly greater locomotor response to the first injection of amphetamine, and greater sensitization, in <b>animals</b> <b>tested</b> in a novel environment than in <b>animals</b> <b>tested</b> at home. These data indicate that environmental factors can exert a large effect on the susceptibility to sensitization, and mechanisms by which this may occur are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Although {{many more}} {{invertebrates}} than vertebrates {{are used in}} <b>animal</b> <b>testing,</b> these studies are largely unregulated by law. The most frequently used invertebrate species are Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, and Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm. In the case of C. elegans, the worm's body is completely transparent and the precise lineage of all the organism's cells is known, while studies in the fly D. melanogaster can use an amazing array of genetic tools. These invertebrates offer some advantages over vertebrates in <b>animal</b> <b>testing,</b> including their short life cycle and {{the ease with which}} large numbers may be housed and studied. However, the lack of an adaptive immune system and their simple organs prevent worms from being used in several aspects of medical research such as vaccine development. Similarly, the fruit fly immune system differs greatly from that of humans, and diseases in insects can be different from diseases in vertebrates; however, fruit flies and waxworms can be useful in studies to identify novel virulence factors or pharmacologically active compounds.|$|E

40|$|Serologic {{testing for}} porcine {{parvovirus}} {{was used to}} illustrate the difficulties of interpreting results of an imperfect test performed on a sample from a herd. Herd seroprevalence and true prevalence levels were classified as low (< 40 %), medium (40 – 79. 9 %) or high (≥ 80 %). Results obtained from simulating herd-level testing, assuming various test sensitivities and specificities and number of <b>animals</b> <b>tested,</b> often deviated from what would be expected based on individuallevel test results. Herd-level test results were evaluated as herd-level predictive values (HPV) and herd-level sensitivities (HSE) {{for each of the}} three seroprevalence and true prevalence categories, respectively. HPV responded differently, as test sensitivity and specificity and number of <b>animals</b> <b>tested</b> changed, depending on the herd seroprevalence category. An increase in sensitivity resulted in an increased HPV (low) and HPV (medium), but a reduced HPV (high). An increase in specificity resulted in an increased HPV (medium) and HPV (high), but a decreased HPV (low). As the number of <b>animals</b> <b>tested</b> increased, the HPV (low) and HPV (high) increased, while HPV (medium.) only had a minor or inapparent change, especially when the sensitivity was ≤ 90 %. HSE also responded differently to changes in test sensitivity and specificity and number of <b>animals</b> <b>tested,</b> depending on the herd true prevalence category. As sensitivity increased, HSE (low) and HSE (medium) decreased, while HSE (high) increased. On the other hand, as specificity increased, HSE (low) and HSE (medium) increased, while HSE (high) decreased. Increasing the number of <b>animals</b> <b>tested</b> resulted in increases in HSE (low) and HSE (medium), but a decrease in HSE (high), especially when the test sensitivity was ≤ 90 %. Findings from this study illustrate the difficulties associated with extrapolating individual <b>animal</b> <b>test</b> results to the herd level. Also, it emphasizes the importance of knowing the herd-level seroprevalence and true prevalence in the population prior to estimating herd-level predictive values and sensitivities, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{verify the}} {{accuracy}} of prospective memory (ProM) tests in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: Twenty mild AD patients (CDR 1), and 20 controls underwent Digit Span (DS), Trail Making (TM) A and B, visual perception, Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning tests, and Cornell Scale for Depression. AD diagnosis was based on DSM-IV and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. ProM was assessed with the appointment and belonging subtests of Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test (RBMT); and with two new tests (the clock and <b>animal</b> <b>tests).</b> Results: AD patients had a worse performance than controls on the majority of tests, except DS forward and TM-A. There was no correlation between RBMT and the new ProM tests.

5|$|Huntington's disease, {{particularly}} {{the application of}} the genetic test for the disease, has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether companies should be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the eugenics movement. In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding its use of embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to its use of <b>animal</b> <b>testing</b> and embryonic stem cells.|$|E

5|$|Beagles are the {{dog breed}} {{most often used}} in <b>animal</b> <b>testing,</b> due to their size and passive nature. Beagles are used {{in a range of}} {{research}} procedures: fundamental biological research, applied human medicine, applied veterinary medicine, and protection of man, animals or the environment. Of the 8,018 dogs used in testing in the UK in 2004, 7,799 were beagles (97.3%). In the UK, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 gave special status to primates, equids, cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals were involved. In 2005 beagles were involved in less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals in the UK, but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved beagles (96.6%). Most dogs are bred specifically for this purpose, by companies such as Harlan. In the UK companies breeding animals for research must be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane's work forms {{part of the}} {{political}} turn in animal ethics—that is, the emergence of academic literature exploring the normative aspects of human/nonhuman animal relationships from a political perspective. He is known for his interest-based account of animal rights, a theory of justice according to which animals have rights based on their possession of normatively-significant interests. The account is a two-tiered one, with individuals' strong interests grounding prima facie rights, and some prima facie rights becoming concrete, or all-things-considered, rights. In this picture, the violation of concrete rights, but not necessarily prima facie rights, represents an injustice. In particular, Cochrane argues that sentient animals' interests against suffering and death ground prima facie rights against the infliction of suffering and death. These prima facie rights convert to concrete rights in, for example, animal agriculture and <b>animal</b> <b>testing,</b> meaning that killing nonhuman animals or making them suffer for these purposes is unjust.|$|E
