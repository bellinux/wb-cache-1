2500|$|A {{crash test}} dummy is a {{full-scale}} anthropomorphic test device that simulates the dimensions, weight proportions and articulation of the human body, and is usually instrumented to record data about the dynamic behavior of the ATD in simulated vehicle impacts. Using human and animal cadaver research from earlier studies, the first artificial {{crash test dummy}} was an <b>anthropomorphic</b> <b>dummy</b> named [...] "Sierra Sam". It was invented in 1949 by Samuel W. Alderson at his Alderson Research Labs (ARL) And Sierra Engineering Co. for the United States Air Force while conducting tests on aircraft ejection seats, pilot restraint harnesses, and aviation helmets. Alderson's early dummies and those of his competitors were fairly primitive, with no pelvic structure and little spinal articulation. With American automakers interested in durable crash test dummies that could be tested and retested while yielding back {{a broad spectrum of}} data during simulated automobile crashes, the first crash test dummy used for automative testing was again invented by Samuel Alderson in 1968. It was called the V.I.P. (Very Important Person) and it was built with dimensions of an average adult man coupled with a steel rib cage, articulated joints, a flexible neck, and a lumbar spine.|$|E

The work considers the problem of identifying contact interactions between a standard <b>anthropomorphic</b> <b>dummy</b> and its surrounding surfaces - seat, belt, airbag, etc. - directly from measured kinematic data. The central theme is that identification is viable, even in cases where there is only limited test data available, and where serious problems of ill-conditioning arise.

40|$|Three six-place, low wing, {{twin-engine}} {{general aviation}} airplane test specimens were crash tested at the langley Impact Dynamics research Facility under controlled free-flight conditions. One structurally unmodified airplane was the baseline airplane specimen {{for the test}} series. The other airplanes were structurally modified to incorporate load-limiting (energy-absorbing) subfloor concepts into the structure for full scale crash test evaluation and comparison to the unmodified airplane test results. Typically, the lowest floor accelerations and <b>anthropomorphic</b> <b>dummy</b> occupant responses, and the least seat crushing of standard and load-limiting seats, occurred in the modified load-limiting subfloor airplanes wherein the greatest structural crushing of the subfloor took place. The better performing of the two load-limiting subfloor concepts reduced the peak airplane floor accelerations at the pilot and four seat/occupant locations to - 25 to - 30 g's as compared to approximately - 50 to - 55 g's acceleration magnitude for the unmodified airplane structure...|$|E

40|$|The {{experience}} gained {{in the last}} decades {{on the development of}} crashworthiness helicopter structures indicates that occupants’ protection can be achieved integrating different energy absorbing systems in landing gears, subfloor and seats. However, the mutual interactions between these different subsystems must be considered to achieve higher overall performances in case of crash events. This work proposes a numerical approach for the evaluation of the overall undercarriage performance, basing on an hybrid multi-body and finite element approach. A hybrid scheme of the subfloor lay-out is integrated with a multibody model of a crashworthy seat and an <b>anthropomorphic</b> <b>dummy</b> model. The modelling technique has been used to investigate and optimize the effects of local aspects on the overall crashworthy performances of the system such as the subfloor and the seat absorbing devices.

40|$|Pediatric {{head injury}} {{is the most}} common cause of death among US children. Depending on the brain injury, the {{literature}} offers conflicting evidence for an increased or decreased vulnerability in the toddler compared to the infant. We combined clinical data of head injuries in infants and toddlers with <b>anthropomorphic</b> <b>dummy</b> studies, animal experiments and finite element model simulations to systematically identify differences in vulnerability to traumatic head injury in infants and toddlers. We found that among infants and toddlers hospitalized for accidental head trauma, significantly more infants sustained a skull fracture compared to toddlers whereas toddlers presented with neurological impairment more frequently than infants, demonstrating unique injuries across age. For head contact events, <b>anthropomorphic</b> <b>dummy</b> studies of falls ≤ 3 feet revealed larger head rotational acceleration and smaller impact duration in the toddler than the infant for the same drop heights and contact surfaces, suggesting that although a thicker, fused skull may protect the toddler from skull fracture, it absorbs less energy on impact, contributing to large head accelerations that might produce more frequent neurological impairment. Non-impact rapid rotations in an animal model demonstrate that moderate rotations in the toddler piglet produce similar subarachnoid hemorrhage and axonal injury severity compared to acceleration-matched rotations in the infant piglet. Furthermore, mild rotations in the toddler piglet produced significantly less severe injuries compared to mass-scaled rotations in the infant. These experimental findings refute the concept that age-dependent injury responses depend solely on mass scaling effects. To compare infant and toddler tissue strain thresholds, we used the measured loads and associated pathology from the animal studies and a 3 D finite element model of the piglet head. We found that the tissue strain threshold required for axonal injury was 3 times higher in the toddler piglet compared to the infant. In summary, enhanced vulnerability of the infant to skull fracture and brain injury compared to the toddler is attributed to differences in brain size, skull thickness, material properties, and injury strains thresholds. These studies provide a rationale for the development of age-specific injury prevention methods to reduce head injuries in infants and toddlers. ...|$|E

A set of two Deployable Energy Absorbers (DEAs) were fitted on the MD- 500 helicopter for the full-scale crash demonstration. Four <b>anthropomorphic</b> <b>dummy</b> occupants were also used to assess human survivability. A demonstration test was performed at NASA Langley's Landing and Impact Research Facility (LandIR). The test involved impacting the helicopter on a concrete surface with combined forward and vertical velocity components of 40 -ft/s and 26 -ft/s, respectively.

Descriptions of this test as well as other component and full-scale tests leading to the helicopter test are discussed.

The crash simulation was executed with a nonlinear, explicit transient dynamic finite element code.

40|$|Public {{awareness}} {{for safety}} and vehicle improvements has contributed to significant reduction in injuries secondary to motor vehicle crashes. The spectrum of trauma has shifted from one region {{of the body to}} another with varying consequences. For example, airbags have minimized head and neck injuries for adults while emphasizing the lower regions of the human body. Studies have concentrated on the changing patterns of these injuries in frontal impacts. However, there is almost a paucity of data with regard to the characterization of abdominal injuries. Consequently, this study was conducted to determine the patterns of abdominal injuries in frontal and side impacts with an emphasis on more recent crashes. In particular, the frequency and severity of trauma were investigated with a focus on the various abdominal organs (e. g., spleen and liver). Results indicate that side crashes contribute to a large percentage of injuries to the abdomen. The liver and spleen organs are most vulnerable; therefore, it may be beneficial to apply concerted efforts to focus on injury biomechanics research and prioritization activities in these areas of the abdomen.

They are the second {{leading cause of}} unintentional-injury death for {{people of all ages}} and {{the leading cause of death}} for elders 79 years and older. Studies have shown that the medical outcome of a fall is largely dependent upon the response and rescue time. Hence, a highly accurate automatic fall detector is an important component of the living setting for older adult to expedite and improve the medical care provided to this population. Though there are several kinds of fall detectors currently available, they suffer from various drawbacks. Some of them are intrusive while others require the user to wear and activate the devices, and hence may fail in the event of user noncompliance. This paper describes the working principle and the design of a floor vibration-based fall detector that is completely passive and unobtrusive to the resident.

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} to identify the feasible region for a constrained optimisation problem. In engineering applications {{the search for the}} feasible region turns out to be extremely useful in the understanding of the problem as the feasible region defines the portion of the domain where design parameters can be ranged to fulfil the constraints imposed on performances, manufacturing and regulations. The search for the feasible region is not a trivial task as non-convex, irregular and disjointed shapes can be found. The algorithm presented in this paper moves from the above considerations and proposes a recursive feasible-infeasible segment bisection algorithm combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques to reduce the overall computational effort. The method is discussed and then illustrated by means of three simple analytical test cases {{in the first part of}} the paper. A real-world application is finally presented: the search for the survivability zone of a crashworthy helicopter seat under different crash conditions. A finite element model, including an <b>anthropomorphic</b> <b>dummy,</b> is adopted to simulate impacts that are characterised by different deceleration pulses and the proposed algorithm is used to investigate the influence of pulse shape on impact survivability...|$|E

For evaluating the repeatability of landmark locations, we propose to use an <b>anthropomorphic</b> <b>dummy</b> with landmark locations premarked. These test objects are measured by a 3 D body scanner to be evaluated. Evaluation parameters such as trueness, precision, and repeatability are calculated from the measured data.

The purposes of the roundrobin test were to evaluate the availability of test objects to different body scanners, and to examine the measurement locations of test objects and quality parameters to be reported. As a result, the proposed test objects could be measured and the data exported by all scanner systems except one, which could not export the ball measurement.
