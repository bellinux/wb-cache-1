5|$|The police's {{operating}} procedure—and the {{law which}} governed their actions—meant {{they were unable}} to open fire without being fired upon first. This, along with the structure of the building, which had a narrow, winding stairwell up which police would have to pass, meant any approach to the gang members was too perilous to attempt. It was decided to wait until dawn before taking any action. At about 7:30am a policeman knocked on the door of number 100, which elicited no response; stones were then thrown at the window to wake the men. Svaars and Sokoloff appeared <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> opened fire at the police. A police sergeant was wounded in the chest: he was evacuated under fire across the rooftops, and taken to the London Hospital. Some members of the police returned fire, but their guns were only effective over shorter ranges, and proved ineffective against the comparatively advanced automatic weapons of Svaars and Sokoloff.|$|E
5|$|While Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is having}} a meeting with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) in his office, Robert California (James Spader) appears <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> frantically says that his wife Susan (Maura Tierney) {{is looking for a}} job in the office, and that Andy must not give her one. When Susan arrives, Andy {{compliantly}} tells her that they have no openings, but Robert insists that they have a look around before coming to any conclusions. Susan looks at the different departments, and decides on accounting. Andy again claims the office is already fully staffed, but Robert insists that he give her a job, even pressuring Andy by reminding him of his power as CEO. Confused by Robert's mixed messages, Andy relents and gives her a job, but Robert later calls Andy on the phone to berate him for hiring Susan. Andy asks everyone in the office to treat her poorly to drive her out, which makes everyone uncomfortable as they like her, but end up doing so nevertheless. When Susan notices their behavior, she complains to Robert, who asks Andy to discuss the issues with Susan in the conference room and leaves. Susan eventually realizes it was Robert's idea to drive her away. When they call Robert out, he vehemently denies it. Andy tells them Jim also heard him say he did not want her working at the office, which Jim overhears, prompting him to flee the office. Robert orders security to close the gate, preventing him from leaving. Jim then runs all over the building, but Andy and Robert find him and take him back to the office. After trying unsuccessfully to deflect their questions about what Robert told Andy, Jim blurts out that he is baffled at Robert's attitude, since Jim enjoys working in the same place as his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and misses her while she is on maternity leave. Andy and Jim leave the conference room and after a short while, Robert and Susan leave. In the parking lot, Andy apologizes to Susan and after brief small talk, Susan asks Andy out on a date, leaving him surprised.|$|E
500|$|Chaplin {{believed}} his first influence {{to be his}} mother, who entertained him as a child by sitting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> mimicking passers-by: [...] "it was through watching her that I learned not only how to express emotions with my hands and face, but also how to observe and study people." [...] Chaplin's early years in music hall allowed him to see stage comedians at work; he also attended the Christmas pantomimes at Drury Lane, where he studied the art of clowning through performers like Dan Leno. [...] Chaplin's years with the Fred Karno company had a formative effect on him as an actor and filmmaker. Simon Louvish writes {{that the company was}} his [...] "training ground", and it was here that Chaplin learned to vary the pace of his comedy. The concept of mixing pathos with slapstick was learnt from Karno, who also used elements of absurdity that became familiar in Chaplin's gags. From the film industry, Chaplin drew upon the work of the French comedian Max Linder, whose films he greatly admired. In developing the Tramp costume and persona, he was likely inspired by the American vaudeville scene, where tramp characters were common.|$|E

2500|$|Sheila {{returns to}} L.A. {{four years later}} to find her now-teenage {{daughter}} Mary (whom she had renamed Erica Lovejoy) (Courtnee Draper). Erica, who is completely unaware of her mother's past or her own real name, has traveled to L.A. to meet her idol - Amber Forrester. She soon develops a crush on Amber's husband, Rick Forrester, although she never intends to act on her feelings. Sheila convinces Erica to seduce Rick, saying that a Forrester man would never abandon the woman carrying his child. She then pays off a man named Lance to drug Amber and take her to bed. [...] Amber tracks Lance down and begins to question him. When a nervous Lance threatens to tell Amber everything, Sheila kills him by releasing a tank of bees into his apartment. [...] Amber becomes increasingly suspicious and confronts Erica in Rick's office. During a struggle, Erica falls and hits her head on a desk, making Amber look guilty of pushing her. [...] At the hospital, a disguised Sheila confronts Amber, warning her {{to stay away from}} her daughter. [...] Amber decides to look for clues at Erica's apartment, but is impeded when Sheila throws a pot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> the police arrive, arresting Amber and causing the Forresters to distrust her further. [...] Meanwhile, while browsing through a photo album of Eric's, Erica is startled to find a picture of her mother. [...] She learns that Sheila was formerly married to Eric, and that her mother wants her to live the life she had always dreamed of with Rick. [...] Sheila pushes Erica to have sex with Rick, so that she can live vicariously as a Forrester through her daughter.|$|E

60|$|The shouts, the clang {{of metal}} {{woke up the}} neighbours; lights were seen <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>and</b> night-capped women {{appeared}} shrieking; doors were thrown open, and men came out in their shirts, sword in hand.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> better classes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> from <b>the</b> housetops abstained {{from any}} demonstration, but watched the captives {{as they passed}} with a {{critical}} eye, and with expressions of admiration at their fearless bearing and haughty mien.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{it seemed}} a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no {{children}} frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>and</b> few people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his grandson.|$|R

Karl wonders if his uncle could ever replace the stoker.|$|R
60|$|The Carmelite turned instinctively {{towards the}} palace, forgetting {{in the sudden}} impulse all but his sense of earthly justice. There were forms <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>and</b> he fancied a signal to stay the {{impending}} blow {{was about to be}} given.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother is so foolish," [...] she declared.

60|$|Half-an-hour later, the {{carriage}} drove {{off with the}} elderly gentleman, {{and two or three}} messengers left the house, speeding in various directions.

60|$|The two English girls, {{confused}} and alarmed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sudden outburst; and unable, until too late, {{to comprehend the}} cause of it, stood alone {{in the middle of}} the street and, too terrified now to move, clung to each other, regardless of the shouts to fly raised by people <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> doors.|$|R
60|$|Saying goodnight to Monsieur Flambard, {{they went}} up to their rooms, their hostess leading with a candle. She had {{made the most of}} her time, since Leigh left the house.

60|$|We {{then turned}} back towards my chambers.
