5000|$|Bottom {{water of}} lakes may feature {{lower level of}} oxygen, {{to the point of}} {{completely}} vanished dissolved oxygen (i.e., becoming [...] ), and higher levels of chlorinity and organic-induced acidity. In many lakes, especially in the zones of continental climate, summer heating and winter cooling create strong vertical temperature gradients which oppose water intermixing, resulting in the periods of summer and winter thermal lake stratification. They are intervened by bottom water overturning, which happens in autumn (<b>autumn</b> <b>overturn)</b> and in spring (spring overturn) due to equalizing of temperature gradients and the resulting easier intermixing by wind and other sources of turbulence.|$|E
40|$|Limnological {{characteristics}} and recent environmental history of five remote subarctic lakes in NW Finnish Lapland were investigated using both limnological and palaeolimnological methods with {{particular attention to}} diatoms. The studied sites were dilute, oligotrophic, circumneutral clear-water lakes with low productivity. Two different thermal structures were recognised; dimictic lakes with brief spring overturn, {{a few weeks of}} stratification, and a relatively long <b>autumn</b> <b>overturn,</b> and isothermal lakes with only one mixing period during the entire open-water season. A single phytoplankton production maximum occurred in the <b>autumn</b> <b>overturn</b> at the main study site, Lake Saanajärvi. The inter-annual variability within the dominant algae groups (chrysophytes and diatoms) was common. Typical benthic habitat preferences were found among diatom communities in Lake Saanajärvi. Epilithic diatoms, such as Achnanthes, Brachysira and Denticula species, were common in the upper littoral zone while epipelic Fragilaria and Navicula species predominated the deeper littoral zone. Extremely slow but constant sedimentation rates were characteristic for the studied lakes indicating low allochthonous and authochtonous inputs. Palaeolimnological studies demonstrated a concurren...|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that low stable carbon isotope (d 13 C) values commonly observed for zooplankton in humic lakes are due to their feeding on isotopically light methane-oxidizing microbes, and thus that methanederived carbon {{is important in the}} food webs of these lakes. In replicate laboratory cultures, Daphnia longispina, a common crustacean zooplankter in humic lakes, were fed microbial suspensions with or without enrichment by biogenic methane. The d 13 C values of Daphnia indicated consumption of 13 C-depleted methanotrophic bacteria, while growth rates, survival, and reproduction of Daphnia in cultures enriched with methane were equal to or greater than those in nonenriched cultures. Results from lake enclosures during the <b>autumn</b> <b>overturn</b> period revealed a decrease in d 13 C of adult Daphnia from 240. 5 % to 250. 3 %, reflecting extensive consumption of 13 Cdepleted methanotrophic bacteria. Methane-derived carbon is a more important contribution to carbon flux through lake pelagic food webs than has previously been suspected...|$|E
40|$|There is {{evidence}} for 10 mechanisms of sediment distribution in small lakes. The sediment accumulation rates measured {{from a common}} horizon in cores from 64 sites on Esthwaite Water, U. K., {{were used to determine}} the relative importance of these mechanisms on the distribution of sediment in the lake. River inflows generally produced localized effects but there were indications of periodic turbidity flows to the deepest point of the lake from the major inflow. Active sediment focusing processes were the dominant distribution mechanisms, a major resuspension of sediment at <b>autumn</b> <b>overturn</b> probably being the most important. The remaining variance was much greater than observed in similar work elsewhere, suggesting that redistribution of sediment by direct and indirect wave action may be taking placeall over the lakebcd during isothermal periods. The relative contributions of the different processes were corroborated by analysis of previously published sediment trap data. It has long been recognized that sediment is not distributed evenly over the bed of most lakes. Many early workers (Wilso...|$|E
40|$|Lake Redó, a {{dimictic}} oligotrophic mountain lake, was monitored for two complete {{years from}} July 1996 to July 1998. The main seasonal {{variations in the}} physical, chemical and biological parameters are described, with special emphasis on the comparison of external forcing (weather and atmospheric deposition) with internal lake dynamics. Annual mean air temperature {{was estimated to be}} 3. 6 °C. The duration of ice cover on the lake was 4. 5 months in 1996 / 97 and 5. 8 months in 1997 / 98. The lake water was very ionpoor (mean annual conductivity 12 μS cm- 1); however, ion concentrations in the lake were higher than in the precipitation, the differences being due mainly to Ca 2 + and bicarbonates originating in the catchment. NH 4 + was the main ion in the precipitation, with an average concentration of 17 μM, while in the lake it was always below 3 μM. However, the concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen always exceeded that of soluble reactive phosphorus by two or three orders of magnitude, so the latter {{is likely to be the}} limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth. Four main production episodes were identified, occurring during spring and <b>autumn</b> <b>overturn,</b> in the upper hypolimnion during summer stratification, and under the ice at the beginning of the ice-covered period. The highest chlorophyll-a concentrations (1. 2 - 2. 2 μg l- 1) were attained during spring overturn; concentrations of chlorophyll-c were high during both spring and <b>autumn</b> <b>overturn,</b> while chlorophyll-b was comparatively important in the upper hypolimnion during the stratification period. Daphnia pulicaria was the most abundant macrozooplankton species; its abundance was highest during the icecovered period, when its biomass was comparable to the measured sestonic particulate carbon concentration. The Daphnia maximum was associated with higher concentrations of NH 4 + and dissolved organic carbon, suggesting that it may play an important role in the pelagic biogeochemical compartment of the lake under ice. Winter respiration rates for the lake were estimated to be 339 mg O 2 m- 2 d- 1 for 1996 / 97 and 281 mg O 2 m- 2 d- 1 for 1997 / 98...|$|E
40|$|Nutrient {{enrichment}} of high-elevation freshwater ecosystems by {{atmospheric deposition}} is increasing worldwide, and bacteria {{are a key}} conduit for the metabolism of organic matter in these oligotrophic environments. We conducted two distinct in situ microcosm experiments in a high-elevation lake (Emerald Lake, Sierra Nevada, California, USA) to evaluate responses in bacterioplankton growth, carbon utilization, and community structure to short-term enrichment by nitrate and phosphate. The first experiment, conducted just following ice-off, employed dark dilution culture to directly {{assess the impact of}} nutrients on bacterioplankton growth and consumption of terrigenous dissolved organic matter during snowmelt. The second experiment, conducted in transparent microcosms during <b>autumn</b> <b>overturn,</b> examined how bacterioplankton in unmanipulated microbial communities responded to nutrients concomitant with increasing phytoplankton-derived organic matter. In both experiments, phosphate enrichment (but not nitrate) caused significant increases in bacterioplankton growth, changed particulate organic stoichiometry, and induced shifts in bacterial community composition, including consistent declines in the relative abundance of Actinobacteria. The dark dilution culture showed a significant increase in dissolved organic carbon removal in response to phosphate enrichment. In transparent microcosms nutrient enrichment had no effect on concentrations of chlorophyll, carbon, or the fluorescence characteristics of dissolved organic matter, suggesting that bacterioplankton responses were independent of phytoplankton responses. These result...|$|E
40|$|Organic carbon {{mineralization}} was {{studied in}} a large humic lake (Lake O ¨ rträsket) in northern Sweden during a well-defined summer stratification period following high water flow during snowmelt. Several independent methods including plankton counts, measurements of bacterioplankton and phytoplankton production, stable isotope moni-toring, sediment trapping, and mass balance calculations were used. Total organic carbon mineralization showed a summer mean of 0. 3 g C m 22 d 21 and was partitioned about equally between water and sediment. In the water column, organic matter was mineralized by bacteria (60 %) and protozoan and metazoan zooplankton (30 %), {{as well as by}} photooxidation (10 %). Most of the mineralized organic carbon was of allochthonous origin. Primary produc-tion in the lake contributed at most 5 % of the total organic carbon input and about 20 % of the total organic carbon mineralization. Total carbon mineralization in the epilimnion and metalimnion agreed well with an estimate of CO 2 evasion from the stratified lake, while CO 2 accumulation in the hypolimnion matched the O 2 consumption and resulted in a very negative d 13 C of DIC before <b>autumn</b> <b>overturn</b> (223 ‰). Isotopic compositions of DIC and POC confirmed the dominant influence of terrestrial organic input on the cycling of both organic and inorganic carbon in the lake. Organic carbon is supplied to lakes by primary productio...|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} examined stability and stratification in a disused mine Fit filled with 1. 75 X lo 7 m 3 of water. Vertical profiles of conductivity and temperature indicated that, due to substantial chemical stratification, spring and <b>autumn</b> <b>overturn</b> did not penetrate {{to the base}} of the pit. Although parameterization i dicated that double diffusion should be expected, we found only circumstantial evidence of associated step structure. The available data suggest that groundwater inflow created a warm salty pool of water at the base of the water column, giving the appearance of a meromictic structure with a monimolimnion. However, this pool was noi. a consistent feature, suggesting both a variable inflow and significant diffusion rates. From the temperature data, estimates indicated that hypolimnetic vertical eddy diffusivity varied between 1 X 10 e 7 and 5 X lo- ” m * s-l. The observations identify short-term relatively energetic internal wave events that may have a significant impact on this value. The present study is useful in two ways: first, it shows how pit-lakes form a natural laboratory fcr a range of processes, and second, it illustrates how these processes relate to diffusion paranieterization. It is clear that reliable parameterization is vital for long-term modeling required for prediction of water quality over decadal timescales. With the closure of an open-cut mining operation come the dual problems of rehabilitation of the mine pit and con...|$|E
40|$|Present {{and past}} diatom and {{crustacean}} zooplankton communities of subarctic Lake Saanajärvi in Finnish Lapland were studied with {{special emphasis on}} their representation in the sediment surface. Two years monitoring of {{the present state of}} the lake revealed it to be ultraoligotrophic with a biomass peak during <b>autumn</b> <b>overturn.</b> Chrysophytes and diatoms were the most abundant phytoplankton groups, with four species forming the main bulk of the crustacean zooplankton community. The comparison of the present plankton community with the species composition in the sediment surface showed that only some plankton groups are suitable for paleolimnological studies. The value of diatoms for paleolimnological studies was supported by the observation that all of the species recorded from various habitats in the lake were detectable in the sediment. In addition, some species (e. g. Cyclotella glomerata) that limnological sampling had not detected were found in the sediment record. Similarly, the zooplankton class Chydoridae and Daphnia hyalina species were equally or better represented in the sediment than in the water column. On the other hand, the sediment trap and core evidence of the whole crustacean zooplankton community suggested many zooplankton species have little or no significance in paleolimnological studies. For example the two dominant copepod species, Eudiaptomus graciloides and Cyclops abyssorum, were not detectable in sediment trap samples. These findings indicate that {{only a small fraction of}} the living biota are preserved in the sediments, and this should be taken into account when drawing conclusions based on the detection of just one such species group...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrology}} of the lake-rich Tibetan Plateau {{is important}} for the global climate, yet {{little is known about the}} thermal regime of Tibetan lakes due to scant data. We (i)  investigated the characteristic seasonal temperature patterns and recent trends in the thermal and stratification regimes of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau and (ii)  tested the performance of the one-dimensional lake parameterization scheme FLake for the Tibetan lake system. For this purpose, we combined 3 years of in situ lake temperature measurements, several decades of satellite observations, and the global reanalysis data. We chose the two largest freshwater Tibetan lakes, Ngoring and Gyaring, as study sites. The lake model FLake faithfully reproduced the specific features of the high-altitude lakes and was subsequently applied to reconstruct the vertically resolved heat transport in both lakes during the last 4 decades. The model suggested that Ngoring and Gyaring were ice-covered for about 6 months and stratified in summer for about 4  months per year with a short spring overturn and a longer <b>autumn</b> <b>overturn.</b> In summer the surface mixed boundary layer extended to 6 – 8  m of depth and was about 20  % shallower in the more turbid Gyaring. The thermal regime of the transparent Ngoring responded more strongly to atmospheric forcing than Gyaring, where the higher turbidity damped the response. According to the reanalysis data, air temperatures and humidity have increased, whereas solar radiation has decreased, since the 1970 s. Surprisingly, the modeled mean lake temperatures did not change, nor did the phenology of the ice cover or stratification. Lake surface temperatures in summer increased only marginally. The reason is that the increase in air temperature was offset by the decrease in radiation, probably due to increasing humidity. This study demonstrates that air temperature trends are not directly coupled to lake temperatures and underscores the importance of shortwave radiation for the thermal regime of high-altitude lakes...|$|E
40|$|Dissolved {{organic matter}} (DOM) in surface waters {{originates}} from allochthonous and autochthonous sources, {{the latter of}} which includes exudation by phytoplankton, viral lysis of planktonic organisms and 'sloppy' feeding by zooplankton. The concentration of DOM in seawater exceeds by one to two orders of magnitude that of particulate organic matter. Thus the DOM pool may be crucial to nutrition of pelagic osmotrophs, such as bacteria and algae, which are capable of exploiting dissolved organic substrates. In this thesis, monitoring surveys and laboratory experiments were {{used to examine the}} seasonal dynamics of DOM, including interactions of DOM and heterotrophic bacteria, in the Gulf of Finland, northern Baltic Sea, which is rich in allochthonous humic DOM. Despite the large ambient DOM pools and their potentially marked influence in the planktonic food webs and biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nutrients, few investigations in the Baltic Sea have focused on the dynamics of DOM, and information from the Gulf of Finland is almost lacking. In this thesis, seasonal changes in the net pools of dissolved organic C (DOC), N (DON) and P (DOP) were followed along with ambient key physical, chemical and biological variables on a shore-to-open-sea salinity gradient once in January and biweekly during the phytoplankton growth season. Horizontal coverage of these data was complemented with DOM samplings along a transect from the western to {{the eastern part of the}} Gulf. Autochthonous DOM accumulated throughout the productive season and the accumulated DOM was N- and P-rich compared with the bulk DOM pool in the surface layer of the Gulf of Finland. Notable DOM accumulation occurred during the actively growing and declining phases of spring and late summer blooms. Total export estimates of surface DOC, DON and DOP by <b>autumn</b> <b>overturn</b> corresponded to about 11 25 % of reported annual particulate organic matter sedimentation in our study area. Seasonal variation in the availability of the net DOC and DON pools for bacterial utilization was investigated with incubations of natural bacterial samples for 2 3 wk. The concentrations of labile DOC were low in spring and during the summer minimum period, whereas the pools of labile DON were more variable. The labile DOM accumulated during and after the late summer cyanobacterial bloom, with low C:N ratios. For determination of factors that control the net DOM pools, limitation of bacterial growth by inorganic nutrients (N and P), labile C and temperature was followed in natural surface and deep-water bacterial samples during the main postspring bloom stages of phytoplankton growth. Agreeing with the low degradability of the ambient DOC pool, bacterial production was consistently C-limited in the surface layer, with N or both N and P as the secondary limiting nutrients from spring to early summer and in late summer, respectively. In deep water, bacterial growth showed combined temperature and C limitation. Sunlight induces photochemical transformation of DOM, and the importance of this process to bacterial growth during summer was investigated with samples representing extensive spatial and temporal coverage. In addition, photochemical transformation of refractory DOM and its effects on growth and composition of the microbial community were studied in further detail during a late summer cyanobacterial bloom. Photochemical transformation of DOM generally resulted in increased bacterial production, and photoproduced labile DOC was estimated to support 95 %) helposti saatavilla olevasta typestä on DON-varannossa.
