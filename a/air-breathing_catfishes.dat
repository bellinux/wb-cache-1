40|$|The {{effects of}} partial and full feed {{restriction}} on the plasma levels of thyroxine (T 4), triiodothyronine (T 3) and testicular activity were {{studied in the}} male <b>air-breathing</b> <b>catfish,</b> Clarias gariepinus. Partial and full feed restriction for 3 weeks significantly decreased the plasma T 4 levels during the progressive and breeding phases, and decreased the plasma T 3 levels only during the breeding phase. However, full feed restriction for 3 weeks increased plasma T 3 levels and T 3 /T 4 ratio during the quiescent, progressive and regressive phases. Histologically, 3 weeks of partial and full feed restriction markedly reduced the testicular activity during the progressive and breeding phases. These results indicate that partial and full feed restriction adversely affects the thyroid hormonogenesis and testicular activity in a phase-dependent manner in C. gariepinus. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sublethal cadmium {{chloride}} (0. 3 ppm) toxicity induced stress related morphopathological alterations in the accessory respiratory {{organ of the}} <b>air-breathing</b> <b>catfish</b> Heteropneustes fossilis (Siluriformes; Heteropneustidae) have been investigated at various intervals of exposure. The histopathological manifestation of the cadmium toxicity includes bulging of the hyperemic secondary lamellae into the lumen of the accessory respiratory organ, necrosis and sloughing of the respiratory epithelium leading to haemorrhage and fusion of SL at various stages of the exposure. Periodic alterations in the densities of epithelial cells and mucous cells along {{with the development of}} non-tissue spaces have also been noticed at different exposure periods leading to alterations in the thickness of the respiratory epithelia. The heavy metal salt exposure has affected the mucogenic activity of the respiratory epithelium not only quantitatively but qualitatively also, indicating the probable ameliorative role fish mucus in cadmium toxicity...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} seasonal variations in thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T 3) levels and testicular activity in the male <b>air-breathing</b> <b>catfish</b> Clarias gariepinus. Plasma T 4 levels increased from March to a peak in July and then decreased throughout autumn, declining to their lowest level in January. Plasma T 3 levels also varied seasonally, increasing from March to a peak in June. The increase in plasma levels of thyroid hormones coincided with an increase in the testicular activity of the fish. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) peaked in May and then declined slowly. In February and March, the testes were characterized by a new generation of spermatogenic cells. Mature spermatozoa appeared in April and became dominant in the testes during the summer months. Testicular activity decreased gradually with the gradual decrease in water temperature and day-length during the autumn season. Decreased testicular activity during the winter months was associated with low GSI values. The patterns of seasonal change in the levels of thyroid hormones as well as testicular activity were similar to those in water temperature and natural day-length. </p...|$|R
40|$|Male <b>air-breathing</b> <b>catfish,</b> Clarias gariepinus {{were exposed}} to hyperosmolar {{mannitol}} solution (250 mM) to determine {{its effect on the}} plasma levels of thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T 3) during the winter, spring, summer and autumn seasons. During the winter season, hyperosmolar mannitol solution significantly increased the plasma levels of T 4 throughout the duration of exposure, whereas the plasma T 3 levels significantly increased only at 12 - 48 h. During the spring season, significant decreases in the plasma levels of T 4 were observed only at 12 and 48 h, and significant increases in the plasma levels of T 3 were observed only at 6 - 24 h. During the summer season, the plasma levels of T 4 significantly increased at 6 h and decreased at 24 - 48 h, while the plasma levels of T 3 significantly increased only at 6 and 24 h. During the autumn season, the plasma levels of T 4 significantly increased at 6, 12 and 48 h and the plasma levels of T 3 significantly decreased at 6, 24 and 48 h. These results indicate the season-dependent and differential effects of the hyperosmolar mannitol solution on the plasma levels of thyroid hormones in Clarias gariepinus...|$|R
40|$|In several water-breathing fish species, P-adrenergic {{receptor}} stimulation by noradrenaline {{leads to}} a decrease in plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels, {{as opposed to an}} increase in air-breathing mammals. We hypothesised that this change in adrenergic control is related to the mode of breathing. Therefore, cannulated <b>air-breathing</b> African <b>catfish</b> were infused for 90 min with noradrenaline or with the nonselective P-agonist, isoprenaline. To identify the receptor type involved, a bolus of either a selective beta(1) -antagonist (atenolol) or a selective beta(2) -antagonist (ICI 118, 551) was injected 15 min prior to the isoprenaline infusion. Both noradrenaline and isoprenaline led to an expected rise in glucose concentration. Isoprenaline combined with both the beta(1) - and beta(2) -antagonist led to higher glucose concentrations than isoprenaline alone. This could indicate the presence of a stimulatory P-adrenoceptor different from beta(1) and beta(2) -adrenoceptors; these two receptors thus seemed to mediate a reduction in plasma glucose concentration. Both noradrenaline and isoprenaline led to a significant decrease in FFA concentration. Whereas the beta(1) -antagonist had no effect, the beta(2) -antagonist reduced the decrease in FFA concentration, indicating the involvement of beta(2) -adrenoceptors. It is concluded that the <b>air-breathing</b> African <b>catfish</b> reflects water-breathing fish in the adrenergic control of plasma FFA and glucose levels...|$|R
40|$|The bottom {{dwelling}} <b>air-breathing</b> <b>catfish,</b> Clarias batrachus (Linn.) also respires via {{its skin}} (an accessory water-breathing organ). Prolonged (90 days) exposure to disodium arsenate heptahydrate has caused massive damage (e. g. {{wear and tear}} of various cellular components including club cells, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the goblet mucous cells, altered staining and the slimy secretion) to the epidermis of its skin. The present study investigated the recovery in architecture of the damaged epidermis following return of the 90 days disodium arsenate heptahydrate exposed fish to clean water. The significant regeneration of its different cellular components (epithelial cells, Club cells, Mucous cells) took place after 24 h of withdrawal when sloughing; wear and tear and other damages of the epidermis of the skin got substantially reduced. The histopathological alterations which still continued included squeezing out of contents of the Club cells that formed a thin layer on the body surface. Regeneration of the Club cells continued throughout the epidermis even though the newly formed Club cells still showed massive sign of degeneration. Altered staining behaviour and hyperactivity of the Mucous cells continues even after prolonged withdrawal of {{the stress of the}} arsenic salt. Similarly the glycoproteins of the slime secreted by the mucous cells retained their sulphate moieties. This indicates that disodium arsenate heptahydrate induces certain permanent non-reversible damages including altered mucogenic activity in the epidermis of the skin of C. batrachus...|$|R
40|$|The {{obligatory}} <b>air-breathing</b> <b>catfish</b> Clarias magur {{is a prime}} {{candidate for}} aquaculture owing to its unique taste, high growth rate, and hardy nature. However, recently the IUCN has listed the species under the endangered category because the population has critically declined in the wild. The sexually mature C. magur brooders are often collected from their natural habitats for seed production in captivity. In many cases, the brooder dies due to handling injuries or confinement stress. In this study, we demonstrated that viable progeny could be generated from freshly dead sexually mature C. magur. Three hours after death, the gonads were excised, macroscopically examined and gamete viability was evaluated. Artificial fertilization was performed by mixing the sperm suspension with the eggs. Water was added after 1 min of mixing to activate the fertilization process. We observed 85 %- 93 % fertilization success from gametes derived from dead donors as opposed to 90 %- 95 % from those derived from live control donors. The embryos showed normal development and resulted in the generation of 88 %- 92 % viable progeny, which {{was similar to the}} progeny derived from control donors (92 %- 93 %). The results obtained in this study will have profound implications in enhancing the seed production of endangered C. magur and could potentially be applied to other key commercially or endangered fish species.

40|$|Respiration {{of african}} {{freshwater}} fishes {{has not been}} largely studied. Main works deal with species of interest to aquaculture (mainly Cichlids) or species with some physiological peculiarities such as euryhalinity, from alkaline biotopes or which are <b>air-breathing</b> (Cichlids, <b>catfishes,</b> lungfishes, etc.). Two groups of factors may affect fish respiration. The first including temperature, salinity and body mass, changes oxygen consumption rates by varying the energy requirements of the fish. The second, mainly oxygen tension, limits the ability of fish to ensure the maintenance of basic oxygen requirements. A generalisation of the expression which models the relationships betwen oxygen consumption and body mass, has been proposed by Winberg (1960...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{morphological}} analyses {{have identified}} a number of different mechanical pathways by which the morphologically complex cranial system of fishes can achieve mouth opening and hyoid depression. However, many of these proposed mechanisms remain untested. Furthermore, very {{little is known about the}} precise timing of activity of each of these mechanisms, and about the magnitude of each mechanism's total contribution to its proposed function. In the present study, all mouth opening and hyoid depression mechanisms described for Clarias gariepinus, an <b>air-breathing</b> <b>catfish,</b> are analysed. Highspeed X-ray videos were recorded during prey capture of three catfish implanted with small, radio-opaque markers in the cranial elements potentially involved. A kinematic analysis was performed from which data were used as input in planar four-bar models. This analysis shows that the opercular mouth-opening mechanism initiates mouth opening, but is not able to cause the complete mouth openings as observed on the X-ray videos. The latter is accomplished through the protractor hyoidei muscles, which couple hyoid depression to lower jaw depression in a four-bar system and also reinforce lower jaw depression by shortening during the final stage of mouth opening. Although the angulo-ceratohyal ligament was previously hypothesised to play a part in mouth opening, our results show that it probably does not, but rather functions as a hyoid-elevator during mouth closure. Finally, hyoid depression is exclusively achieved by the four-bar mechanism involving neurocranial elevation and pectoral girdle retraction, generally without any reinforcement by shortening of the sternohyoideus muscle. In contrast to the results from a recent analysis on sunfish, the catfish's sternohyoideus gradually elongates during hyoid depression...|$|R
40|$|Background: Fushi tarazu factor 1 (FTZ-F 1) encodes {{an orphan}} nuclear {{receptor}} {{belonging to the}} nuclear receptor family 5 A (NR 5 A) which includes adrenal 4 -binding protein or steroidogenic factor- 1 (Ad 4 BP/SF- 1) and liver receptor homologue 1 (LRH- 1) and plays {{a pivotal role in}} the regulation of aromatases. Methodology/Principal Findings: Present study was aimed to understand the importance of FTZ-F 1 in relation to brain aromatase (cyp 19 a 1 b) during development, recrudescence and after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) induction. Initially, we cloned FTZ-F 1 from the brain of <b>air-breathing</b> <b>catfish,</b> Clarias gariepinus through degenerate primer RT-PCR and RACE. Its sequence analysis revealed high homology with other NR 5 A 1 group members Ad 4 BP/SF- 1 and LRH- 1, and also analogous to the spatial expression pattern of the latter. In order to draw functional correlation of cyp 19 a 1 b and FTZ-F 1, we analyzed the expression pattern of the latter in brain during gonadal ontogeny, which revealed early expression during gonadal differentiation. The tissue distribution both at transcript and protein levels revealed its prominent expression in brain along with liver, kidney and testis. The expression pattern of brain FTZ-F 1 during reproductive cycle and after hCG induction, in vivo was analogous to that of cyp 19 a 1 b shown in our earlier study indicating its involvement in recrudescence. Conclusions/Significance: Based on our previous results on cyp 19 a 1 b and the present data, it is plausible to implicate potential roles for brain FTZ-F 1 in ovarian differentiation and recrudescence process probably through regulation o...|$|R
40|$|The <b>air-breathing</b> singhi <b>catfish</b> (Heteropneustes fossilis) is {{frequently}} {{being challenged by}} different environmental insults such as hyper-ammonia, dehydration and osmotic stresses in their natural habitats throughout the year. The present study investigated the effect of hyperosmotic stress, due to exposure to hypertonic environment (300 mM mannitol) for 14 days, on gluconeogenesis in this catfish. In situ exposure to hypertonic environment led to significant stimulation of gluconeogenic fluxes from the perfused liver after 7 days of exposure, followed by further increase after 14 days in presence of three different potential gluconeogenic substrates (lactate, pyruvate and glutamate). Environmental hypertonicity also caused a significant increase of activities of key gluconeogenic enzymes, namely phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphatase and glucose 6 -phosphatase by about 2 - 6 fold in liver, and 3 - 6 fold in kidney tissues. This was accompanied by more abundance of enzyme proteins by about 1. 8 – 3. 7 fold and mRNAs by about 2. 2 – 5. 2 fold in both the tissues with a maximum increase after 14 days of exposure. Hence, the increase in activities of key gluconeogenic enzymes under hypertonic stress appeared to be {{as a result of}} transcriptional regulation of genes. Immunocytochemical analysis further confirmed the tissue specific localized expression of these enzymes in both the tissues with the possibility of expressing more in the same localized places. The induction of gluconeogenesis during exposure to environmental hypertonicity possibly occurs as a consequenc...|$|R
40|$|Fast-starts are brief {{accelerations}} commonly {{observed in}} fish {{within the context}} of predator-prey interactions. In typical C-start escape responses, fish react to a threatening stimulus by bending their body into a C-shape during the first muscle contraction (i. e. stage 1) which provides a sudden acceleration away from the stimulus. Recently, similar C-starts have been recorded in fish aiming at a prey. Little is known about C-starts outside the context of predator-prey interactions, though recent work has shown that escape response can also be induced by high temperature. Here, we test the hypothesis that air-breathing fish may use C-starts in the context of gulping air at the surface. Hoplosternum littorale is an <b>air-breathing</b> freshwater <b>catfish</b> found in South America. Field video observations reveal that their air-breathing behaviour consists of airgulping at the surface, followed by a fast turn which re-directs the fish towards the bottom. Using high-speed video in the laboratory, we compared the kinematics of the turn immediately following airgulping performed by H. littorale in normoxia with those of mechanically-triggered C-start escape responses and with routine (i. e. spontaneous) turns. Our results show that air-breathing events overlap considerably with escape responses with a large stage 1 angle in terms of turning rates, distance covered and the relationship between these rates. Therefore, these two behaviours can be considered kinematically comparable, suggesting that air-breathing in this species is followed by escape-like C-start motions, presumably to minimise time at the surface and exposure to avian predators. These findings show that C-starts can occur in a variety of contexts in which fish may need to get away from areas of potential danger...|$|R

Acesso restrito. p. 243 - 256 Hypoxic {{water and}} episodic air {{exposure}} are potentially life-threatening conditions that fish in tropical regions can face {{during the dry}} season. This study investigated the air-breathing behavior, oxygen consumption, and respiratory responses of the <b>air-breathing</b> (AB) armored <b>catfish</b> Pterygoplichthys anisitsi. The hematological parameters and oxygenbinding characteristics of whole blood and stripped hemoglobin and the intermediate metabolism of selected tissue in normoxia, different hypoxic conditions, and after air exposure were also examined. In normoxia, this species exhibited high activity at night and AB behavior (2 – 5 AB h- 1). The exposure to acute severe hypoxia elicited the AB behavior (4 AB h- 1) during the day. Under progressive hypoxia without access to the water surface, the fish were oxyregulators with a critical O 2 tension, calculated as the inspired water O 2 pressure, as 47 ± 2 mmHg. At water O 2 tensions lower than 40 mmHg, the fish exhibited continuous apnea behavior. The blood exhibited high capacity for transporting O 2, having a cathodic hemoglobin component with a high Hb–O 2 affinity. Under severe hypoxia, the fish used anaerobic metabolism to maintain metabolic rate.

40|$|The <b>air-breathing</b> singhi <b>catfish</b> (Heteropneustes fossilis) is {{frequently}} {{being challenged by}} bacterial contaminants, and different environmental insults like osmotic, hyper-ammonia, dehydration and oxidative stresses in its natural habitats throughout the year. The main objectives of the present investigation were to determine (a) the possible induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene with enhanced production of nitric oxide (NO) by intra-peritoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (a bacterial endotoxin), and (b) {{to determine the effects}} of hepatic cell volume changes due to anisotonicity or by infusion of certain metabolites, stress hormones and by induction of oxidative stress on production of NO from the iNOS-induced perfused liver of singhi catfish. Intra-peritoneal injection of LPS led to induction of iNOS gene and localized tissue specific expression of iNOS enzyme with more production and accumulation of NO in different tissues of singhi catfish. Further, changes of hydration status/cell volume, caused either by anisotonicity or by infusion of certain metabolites such as glutamine plus glycine and adenosine, affected the NO production from the perfused liver of iNOS-induced singhi catfish. In general, increase of hydration status/cell swelling due to hypotonicity caused decrease, and decrease of hydration status/cell shrinkage due to hypertonicity caused increase of NO efflux from the perfused liver, thus suggesting that changes in hydration status/cell volume of hepatic cells serve as a potent modulator for regulating the NO production. Significant increase of NO efflux from the perfused liver was also observed while infusing the liver with stress hormones like epinephrine and norepinephrine, accompanied with decrease of hydration status/cell volume of hepatic cells. Further, oxidative stress, caused due to infusion of t-butyl hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide separately, in the perfused liver of singhi catfish, resulted in significant increase of NO efflux accompanied with decrease of hydration status/cell volume of hepatic cells. However, the reasons for these cell volume-sensitive changes of NO efflux from the liver of singhi catfish are not fully understood with the available data. Nonetheless, enhanced or decreased production of NO from the perfused liver under osmotic stress, in presence of stress hormones and oxidative stress reflected its potential role in cellular homeostasis and also for better adaptations under environmental challenges. This is the first report of osmosensitive and oxidative stress-induced changes of NO production and efflux from the liver of any teleosts. Further, the level of expression of iNOS in this singhi catfish could also serve as an important indicator to determine the pathological status of the external environment...|$|R
