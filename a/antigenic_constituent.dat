40|$|The Ouchterlony double {{diffusion}} {{method in}} agar gel {{has been used}} to study the antigens of the vaccinia and pig pox viruses and their corresponding antibodies. The existence of a common <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituent</b> in the two viruses has been demonstrated.

40|$|Antibody was {{obtained}} in rabbits following immunization with porcine chondromucoprotein and complete adjuvant. Several constituents of the antigen were only revealed by prior hyaluronidase digestion, while an <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituent</b> revealed without hyaluronidase treatment {{was found to}} be shared by chondromucoproteins from several other species. Cross-reactivity was confirmed by tanned cell haemagglutination-inhibition and by delayed hypersensitivity reactions in guinea-pigs. Electrophoresis of chondromucoprotein gave some separation of the immunologically distinct constituents. The results suggest that chondromucoprotein may be made up of several species-specific proteins as well as a polysaccharide-peptide of common occurrence in several species. No evidence for antibody directed against chondroitin sulphate was found...|$|E

Further study of cultures of Salmonella hamiltan, S. worthington, and S. meleagridis of complex constitution indicated that loss of a third phase was not involved but that instead the organisms lost a major <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituent</b> present in both phases of diphasic types and in the single flagellar phase of monophasic types.

40|$|Fourteen <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituents</b> {{have been}} {{detected}} in Arachis hypogaea seeds. The major proteins of the classic arachin and conarachin fractions have been identified. Arachin contains 4 antigens (the major one called α-arachin) and conarachin contains 2 which have been called α 1, and α 2 -conarachin. Structural differences between α-arachin, α 1 and α 2 -conarachin are indicated by their different antigenic specificities. α-Arachin precipitates as a separate entity at low temperature. The action of trypsin on this protein induces an increase in electrophoretic mobility and prevents precipitation at low temperature. This enzyme has no detectable effect on α 1 and α 2 -conarachin...|$|R
40|$|A major <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituent</b> of {{the inner}} {{membrane}} of Escherichia coli ML 308 - 225 {{was identified as a}} 28. 5 -kilodalton lipoprotein containing covalently bound glycerol and palmitate. This lipoprotein corresponded to antigen 47 in the crossed immunoelectrophoresis profile of membrane vesicles (P. Owen and H. R. Kaback, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75 : 3148 - 3152, 1978) and to new lipoprotein 4 described for E. coli B by Ichihara et al. (S. Ichihara, H. Hussain, and S. Mizushima, J. Biol. Chem. 256 : 3125 - 3129, 1980). Experiments involving isopycnic centrifugation of spheroplast envelopes indicated that antigen 47 was enriched in cytoplasmic membrane subfractions of low density. The protein did not manifest an obvious association with peptidoglycan of the types displayed by the bound form of the Braun (Lpp) lipoprotein, the 21 -kilodalton peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein, or the ompF/C gene products. Antibodies specific for antigen 47 were used to demonstrate that the molecule was immunologically distinct from both the Braun lipoprotein and the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein of E. coli. Antigens of similar molecular mass to and cross-reacting with antigen 47 were present in the envelopes of eight type species of the Enterobacteriaceae. A protocol for the purification of antigen 47, based upon its solubility in a chloroform-methanol-water mixture, was developed...|$|E
40|$|Membranoproliferative {{glomerulonephritis}} (MPGN) may be {{a component}} of a generalized vasculitis {{as well as a}} component of the clinical expression of type-II mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC). Several studies have established a striking association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and MC. The potential role of HCV in the pathogenesis of MPGN, which occurs in almost half of the cases of MC patients, has not been fully investigated, and the demonstration of HCV proteins as the <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituent</b> of the glomerular immune deposits has remained elusive. Kidney biopsy specimens were obtained from 12 HCV RNA, antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) -positive patients with MPGN and type-II MC, and from 8 controls (3 HCV RNA, anti-HCV-negative patients with MPGN and MC and 5 with noncryoglobulinemic "idiopathic" MPGN). Murine monoclonal antibodies developed against c 22 - 3, E 2 /NS 1, c 33 c, c 100 - 3, and NS 5 proteins were used to detect HCV-related antigens by indirect immunohistochemistry. Acid electroelution of tissue sections was performed to enhance the sensitivity of the immunohistochemical method. Specific HCV-related proteins were detected in glomerular and tubulo-interstitial vascular structures in 8 (66. 7 %) HCV-positive MC patients and in none of the HCV RNA, anti-HCV-negative controls. HCV immunoreactive deposits displayed the following two major patterns: 1) a linear, homogeneous deposition along glomerular capillary walls, including endothelial cells and sub-endothelial spaces; and 2) a granular bead-like appearance with distinct deposits in mesangial and paramesangial cells. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM) and C 3 fraction deposition in adjacent kidney sections displayed features comparable with those found for HCV deposits. Patients with granular deposits showed more pronounced renal impairment and severe proteinuria. These findings indicate that in MC patients with HCV-associated MPGN, kidney deposits consist of HCV-containing immune complexes that are likely to play a direct pathogenetic role in the renal damage...|$|E
40|$|Antigens {{extracted}} from leprosy bacilli obtained from infected human and armadillo tissues {{have been examined}} by immunodiffusion analysis with serum samples from lepromatous patients and with immune sera raised in rabbits. Using the best combinations of serum and antigen extracts, 12 <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituents</b> {{were found in the}} leprosy bacilli. Six of these were antigens common to all mycobacteria and nocardiae, 4 were specific to the leprosy bacillus and the position of 2 could not be determined. Groups ii and iii antigens (i. e. those associated with the slow growing and fast growing subgenera of mycobacteria) were not found in theleprosy bacillus, suggesting some relationship with M. vaccae and similar strains, in which these antigens are also missing.

40|$|A {{water soluble}} extract of rat bone marrow was {{compared}} with similar extracts {{of several other}} organs of the reticuloendothelial system by simple electrophoresis in agar gel and by immunoelectrophoretic analysis followed by selective staining of chemical and enzymatically active constituents. Antiserum prepared against the soluble bone marrow extract showed extensive cross-reactions with extracts of the other organs used in the study; the extracts possessing the most <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituents</b> in common with marrow were those of spleen and peritoneal exudate cells. Immunoelectrophoretic analysis of the marrow extract, combined with absorption of the anti-marrow serum with extracts of the other organs, permitted {{the identification of the}} antigens common to marrow, spleen, peritoneal exudate cells, lymph node, thymus, liver and heart. Every antigen detected in bone marrow was found in at least one other organ extract and several of these antigens were found to possess enzymatic activities.

40|$|Vascular {{basement}} membrane was disrupted {{in the presence}} of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN's) during two immunologic reactions: The Arthus phenomenon and the reaction to locally injected antibody to vascular {{basement membrane}}. This disruption was evidenced by (a) the inability of the basement membrane to retain circulating carbon, by (b) loss of <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituents,</b> and by (c) electron microscopic observation showing actual gaps {{in the structure of the}} vascular basement membrane. The factors within PMN's responsible for damage to isolated glomerular basement membrane in vitro were found by isolation procedures to be cathepsins D and E. Cationic proteins of PMN's were separable from the cathepsins. While inducing vascular permeability upon injection, these basic proteins failed to inflict the severe damage to the basement membrane observed in Arthus and antibasement membrane reactions. It is concluded that the full expression of these immunologic lesions requires destruction of the basement membrane possibly brought about by cathepsins D and E. Some of the physicochemical properties of these pathologically active leukocytic factors are given...|$|R
40|$|Serological and {{chemical}} methods {{were used to}} study the <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituents</b> of enterococci. Lancefield and Fuller extracts of eight enterococcus strains, representing four species, were investigated in double diffusion in agar for antigenic pattern and relationship. Cell fractions of S. faecalis were examined for antigenic components by latex agglutination, passive hem agglutination and double diffusion. A group specific antigen was demonstrated in a cytoplasmic fraction. The isolated and partially purified antigen was analyzed chromatographically and electrophoretically. Cell wall components of representative strains were isolated by different methods and analyzed serologically and by paper and thin layer chromatography. Hexosamine, D(+) glucose and L(+) rhamnose were identified. The amino acid composition varied but DL alpha alanine was consistently present. A peptide consisting of seven amino acids was demonstrated. Immunoelectrophoretic analysis of such extracts appeared promising. Separation of components by gel filtration was unsuccessful. The G+C percentage composition of the strains was determined in cesium chloride density gradient...|$|R
40|$|AN appreciable {{increase}} in the radiosensitivity of the C 3 H mammary carcinoma was observed when the tumour-bearing mice were inoculated subcutaneously, about 2 weeks prior to treatment, with fragments of tumour or of isogenic neonatal skin previously irradiated with doses of 5000 - 7000 r (Cohen and Cohen, 1957). Since these isologous tissues are not normally antigenic, {{it was concluded that}} the attenuating procedure had changed some specific " identity markers " in the tumour and skin inocula, equivocating their isogenic pattern, thus evoking a type of homograft reaction in the host. This disturbance of the balance between the growing tumour and its host resulted in an enhanced response of the tumour to a comparatively small dose of radiation. If radiation-attenuated isologous tissues act in this way, that is, by virtue of new <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituents,</b> resembling, but not identical with the tumour antigens, then unirradiated homologous tissues from other mouse strains or closely related species should also have a radiosensitizing action. The following experiments were designed to test this hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|IgG {{antibodies}} {{produced by}} rabbits immunized against S. mansoni antigens cross-reacted with aqueous soluble constituents {{of a variety}} of allergens. The antibody cross-reactivity was largely sensitive to degradation by treatment of the target antigens with sodium meta-periodate, suggesting the cross-reactivity was due to carbohydrate determinants that were common to both the schistosome and the allergens (CCDs). The reaction between the rabbit antibodies and a 43 kDa molecule in a rubber latex extract was analysed further: tandem mass spectrometry identified the latex molecule as allergen Hev b 7. Rabbit anti-schistosome IgG antibodies purified by acid-elution from solid-phase latex Hev b 7 reacted with the S. mansoni egg antigens IPSE/alpha- 1 and kappa- 5 and cercarial antigens SPO- 1 and a fatty acid-binding protein. Moreover, purified anti-S. mansoni egg, latex cross-reactive antibodies reacted with <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituents</b> of some fruits, a result of potential relevance to the latex-fruit syndrome of allergic reactions. We propose that IgG anti-schistosome antibodies that cross-react with allergens may be able to block IgE-induced allergic reactions and thus provide a possible explanation for the hygiene hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Several {{attempts}} have been made in recent years to study the <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituents</b> of amyloid and purified amyloid fibrils (1 - 5). Depending on the state of purity of the antigens used for immunization, one or more serum proteins have been identified in all such preparations. Among these are "},-globulins, lipoproteins, certain complement components, and a number of ~ 1 and a 2 globulins. The purest of these preparations induced the formation of antibodies to only one substance, the "P component, " which is an al globulin with a sedimentation coefficient between 7 and 19 S present in normal serum but not in nonamyloid tissues (6). The "P component " appears to correspond to the pentagonal structures, also known as rods or doughnuts, reported by Glenner et al (7). The "P component " does not constitute a major constituent of amyloid since in preparations of amyloid fibrils containing large amounts of the component, {{only a small fraction of}} the protein was precipitable by the antiserum (5, 6). The recent demonstration that the major constituent of amyloid is a fibrilla...|$|R
40|$|A {{wide variety}} of human adult and fetal tissues were studied by immune-diffusion {{techniques}} in agar gel {{to determine whether they}} contained the tumor-specific antigen(s) previously found in coionic cancers. In the adult tissues it was demonstrated that identical antigens were present in all tested specimens of malignant tumors of the entodermally derived epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, but were absent from all other tested adult tissues. The common <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituents,</b> therefore, represent system-specific cancer antigens of the human digestive system. System-specific cancer antigens have not previously been demonstrated in humans. Experiments with fetal tissues demonstrated that identical antigens were also present in fetal gut, liver, and pancreas between 2 and 6 months of gestation. These components were named "carcinoembryonic" antigens of the human digestive system. On the basis of the present findings and the recent work regarding control of the expression of genetic potentialities in various types of cells, it was concluded that the carcinoembryonic antigens represent cellular constituents which are repressed during the course of differentiation of the normal digestive system epithelium and reappear in the corresponding malignant cells by a process of derepressive-dedifferentiation...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{investigations}} into the chemistry of antigen-antibody reactions have dealt largely with antigens. The effect of chemical modification on the immunological reactivity of protein antigens has been extensively studied by Landsteiner and his coworkers; and considerable {{progress has been made}} in the chemical identification of the <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituents</b> of bacteria, red blood ceils and other complex cellular antigens. In comparison, little is known of the chemistry of antibodies. There is a considerable body of evidence which indicates with a strong degree of probability that antibodies are proteins associated with the globulin fraction of the serum which combine with the homologous antigen to form a surface layer of protein, somehow rendered insoluble by this combination. These conclusions are supported by the chemical properties of the antibody in solution, the surface properties of antigen-antibody compounds, their flocculating tendencies and immunological behavior, and by the N content of antigen-antibody aggregates 3 Little has been done, however, to identify either the chemical groups in antibodies which endow them with their specific reactivity, or those which are responsible for the characteristic properties of antigen-antibody compounds: susceptibility to aggregation and to phagocytosis, and the extraordinary avidity for complement which results in complement fixation, hemolysis, bacteriolysis and bactericidal action.

40|$|Plasma {{membranes}} {{have been}} isolated from pure populations of rabbit alveolar macrophages which were swollen in water, fixed briefly with glutaraldehyde, disrupted by Dounce homogenization, and separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The recovered membranes exhibited good structural preservation and enzymatic activity; both morphologic and biochemical evidence indicated {{a high degree}} of purity (> 90 %) of the membrane preparation. Interiorized plasma membranes were also prepared without exposure to glutaraldehyde from phagocytic vacuoles recovered from alveolar macrophages which had ingested large numbers of polystyrene spheres. These membranes were contaminated with lysosomal constituents, but they were nevertheless of value for comparison to the "pure" membranes isolated by the glutaraldehyde procedure. Acrylamide gel electrophoresis of the solubilized plasma membranes and phagolysosomal membranes revealed similar protein patterns, with seven to nine individual components ranging in molecular weight from 70, 000 to 140, 000. The two most rapidly migrating components gave positive reactions for lipid as well as protein. A band containing carbohydrate was detected near the origin of the plasma membrane gels. Antisera were made by injecting guinea pigs with the purified rabbit alveolar macrophage plasma membranes. Gel diffusion and immunoelectrophoretic study of these antisera established the presence of rabbit immunoglobulin G and of one or two other <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituents</b> in the membrane preparation...|$|R
40|$|The <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituents</b> of {{sporulated}} Cryptosporidium parvum oocyst antigens {{were characterized}} with antisera from mice immunized against C. parvum. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining defined the major proteins. Six of seven lectins used recognized {{as many as}} 15 bands. The lectins concanavalin A, Dolichos biflorus, and wheat germ agglutinin showed strong activity against the same eight bands with molecular weights ranging from 72, 000 to greater than 100, 000. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect antibody to C. parvum. Antibody binding was significantly decreased by heat and enzymatic treatment with trypsin, protease, and mixed glycosidases. C. parvum antigens were further defined by the reactivity of immune sera with a C. parvum sonicate preparation separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose paper. Antisera from orally infected mice consistently recognized four antigens with molecular weights ranging from 72, 000 to greater than 100, 000. These antigens also bound concanavalin A. Treatment of the antigen preparation with mixed glycosidases reduced the reactivity of antisera with most antigens with molecular weights greater than 60, 000. The {{data suggest that the}} antigenic composition of C. parvum is complex and that carbohydrates alone or in association with lipids or proteins may be important in the immune response to C. parvum...|$|R
40|$|Background: GMZ 2 is {{a fusion}} protein of Plasmodium falciparum {{merozoite}} surface protein 3 (MSP 3) and glutamate rich protein (GLURP) that mediates an immune response against the blood stage of the parasite. Two previous phase I clinical trials, one in naïve European adults and one in malaria-exposed Gabonese adults showed that GMZ 2 was well tolerated and immunogenic. Here, we present data on safety and immunogenicity of GMZ 2 in one to five year old Gabonese children, a target population for future malaria vaccine efficacy trials. Methodology/Principal Findings: Thirty children one to five years of age were randomized to receive three doses of either 30 mg or 100 mg of GMZ 2, or rabies vaccine. GMZ 2, adjuvanted in aluminum hydroxide, was administered on Days 0, 28 and 56. All participants received a full course of their respective vaccination and were followed up for one year.

40|$|High-molecular-weight {{proteins}} having M protein reactivity {{were isolated}} without acid or alkaline digestion. Treatment of a heat-killed group A Streptococcus with sonic vibration released antigens which reacted strongly and specifically with absorbed type-specific antiserum. This antigen preparation was released without diminishing the total yield of acid-extractable M protein {{of the original}} heat-killed cells. Fractionation of the sonic preparation on a sucrose gradient yielded four peaks of M reactivity. When these fractions were placed on Sephadex G- 200 columns, the M reactive material of three fractions appeared in the void volumes, suggesting that the active material in each had a molecular weight greater than 300, 000. The reactivity of the fourth fraction followed closely the void volume of Sephadex G- 100. Chemical analysis revealed heterogeneity of the fractions. Spectral analysis showed virtual absence of nucleic acid {{in three of the}} fractions and a moderate amount in the fourth. Bactericidal inhibition tests showed activity of three of the four fractions. Analysis of the fractions by Ouchterlony double-diffusion technique revealed that each of the four fractions had several <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituents.</b> All four contained M antigen. T antigen and a third unnamed antigen were present in some of the fractions. Group reactivity was present in all fractions, but did not reside on the M molecule.

40|$|The Shigella invasin complex (Invaplex) is an {{effective}} mucosal vaccine capable of protecting against Shigella challenge in animal models. The major <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituents</b> of Invaplex are the Ipa proteins and lipopolysaccharide. The cell-binding capacity of the Ipa proteins prompted {{the investigation into the}} adjuvanticity of Invaplex. Using ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen, intranasal immunization with OVA combined with Invaplex was found to enhance anti-OVA serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA responses and induce OVA-specific mucosal antibody responses at sites located both proximal and distal to the immunization site. The immune responses induced with OVA and Invaplex were comparable in both magnitude and duration to the immune responses induced after immunization with OVA and cholera toxin. The OVA-specific immune response was characterized by high levels of serum IgG 1 and increased production of interleukin- 4 (IL- 4), IL- 5, or IL- 10 from lymphoid cells of immunized animals, suggesting a Th 2 response. In addition to enhancing the immunogenicity of OVA, Invaplex-specific immune responses were also induced, indicating the potential {{for the development of a}} combination vaccine consisting of Invaplex and other immunogens.

Site-specific arrays of antigens were identified in detergent-isolated GBM in a distribution similar to that observed in intact kidney. In the human, fibronectin, procollagen IV, and collagen V were observed along the internal aspect of GBM continuous with antigenic sites in the mesangium. Another array of antigens was identified in the GBM but not within the mesangium [...] Goodpasture's antigen, bovine lens capsule type IV collagen, and amyloid P component. In addition, sites reactive with rabbit antiserum to laminin were present {{on both sides of the}} lamina densa as well as within the mesangial region. Actomyosin, a presumed mesangial cell antigen persisted in the mesangium of isolated GBM. Mesangial matrix was identified in detergent-isolated GBM in an amount equivalent to that present in intact glomeruli. Sonicated GBM contained the same antigens but it was not possible to quantitate the amount of mesangial material by immunofluorescence or morphometric analysis. The thickness of the lamina densa was greater in sonicated and detergent-treated rat GBM preparations than in native rat kidney.

The results of chemical analysis, of analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed in conjunction with silver staining, and of analysis by crossed immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel-crossed immunoelectrophoresis, and Western blotting showed clearly that lipopolysaccharide was a major constituent of each monovalent extract {{and that it was}} probably the dominant antigen present in at least 15 of the 16 monovalent extracts. A 16. 2 -kilodalton protein, which was pronase resistant and nonsedimentable at 105, 000 X g and which appeared to be biochemically and antigenically unrelated to pili, was a common although minor antigen for all extracts.

Extraction with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) urea, lithium diiodosalicylate, and boiling water did not solubilize any material which stained with AgNO 3 in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. The parent organism S. sanguis 12, which aggregates in saliva, adheres to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite and is hydrophobic, was found to possess a prominently staining 160, 000 molecular weight (MW) protein. This protein was almost completely absent from strain 12 na, a hydrophobic nonaggregating variant, and was completely absent from the hydrophilic nonaggregating strain 12 L. Trypsinization of strain 12 resulted in the coincident loss of the 160, 000 -MW protein and the ability to aggregate in saliva. Trypsin treatment reduced but did not eliminate the hydrophobic character of the cells. Boiling destroyed their ability to aggregate, but did not alter their hydrophobicity. Cell wall digests of strain 12 contained a number of proteins which were absent from strains 12 na and 12 L. Mutanolysin digests of cell walls of the hydrophilic strains contained almost no material that was visible in a silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel.

The isolation of cell-free <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituents</b> from Gram-negative microorganisms has been reported {{by a number of}} investigators; most notable among these are Boivin (1) and his collaborators who have studied the specific antigens of Salmonella typhiraurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Eberthella typhosa, Escherichia coli, etc., and Topley (2) who has described the specific H and O antigens obtained from enzymatic breakdown products of E. typhosa. Perhaps the most comprehensive study regarding the nature of antigenic fractions from Gram-negative bacilli is that of Morgan and Partridge who have studied in detail the specific antigens of the Shiga (3) and typhoid (4) bacillus and have investigated their chemical and immunological properties. The chemical nature of antigens derived from Gram-negative bacilli is not yet fully understood. Boivin regarded these substances as {{belonging to}} a class of compounds known as lipocarbohydrates.

In considering the possible relationship of the Mima-Herellea group to the genus Moraxella, the approach used was the isolation and identification of representative <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituents</b> of strains designated Mima polymorpha, M. polymorpha var. oxidans, Herellea vaginicola, Moraxella lwoffi, M. liquefaciens, M. non-liquefaciens, and Bacterium anitratum. Cell-free extracts of sonically disrupted cells were used in these studies, and the precipitinogens derived by this method {{were considered to be}} of capsular and somatic origin. Identity among the strains was established by immunodiffusion, with immune sera and antigenic extracts. Heterologous and homologous reactions were performed with adsorbed and unadsorbed sera to verify the cases of identity. In every instance of homologous reaction, at least five distinct antigen-antibody systems were discernible within the Mima-Herellea group. However, as evidenced by heterologous studies, the demonstrable antigenic composition varied among the species and, in some instances, among the strains. M. polymorpha var. oxidans appeared to be serologically distinct from H. vaginicola and M. polymorpha, whereas strains of the latter two organisms were theorized to be closely related serologically. Serological cross-reactions in heterologous studies and reciprocal adsorption tests revealed the existence of a serological relationship between members of the Mima-Herellea {{group and the}} genus Moraxella.

40|$|Two major {{antigenic}} fragments {{were obtained}} from various purified γ-globulin preparations after papain treatment. One, the F component, had a mobility faster than the original γ-globulin and the second, the S component, had a slower mobility. Similar F and S components were also obtained with certain homogeneous myeloma proteins which were closely related to γ-globulin immunologically. Additional minor antigenic components were detected with certain antisera. The technique of immunoelectrophoresis was particularly useful for bringing out the different <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituents</b> obtained after papain treatment. The F and S components {{as well as a}} midfraction were isolated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. These were immunologically homogeneous and could be utilized to absorb F and S antibodies from various antisera. The relative amount of F and S antibodies varied in different antisera from individual rabbits immunized with whole γ-globulin. Whole γ-globulin was separated by zone electrophoresis into a fast migrating and a more slowly migrating fraction. Each of these gave rise to F and S components after splitting with papain. The F components of the two γ-globulins were similar in mobility, while the S components showed marked mobility differences although antigenically they were very similar. The mobility differences of the parent γ-globulin appeared to be primarily related to the differences in the S component. Certain antisera against pathological γ-globulins were found to give double lines {{with a wide variety of}} γ-globulin preparations in agar diffusion. These were shown to be related to the F and S antigenic determinants of γ-glubulin. This relationship was evident by a number of procedures utilizing both Ouchterlony plate techniques and immunoelectrophoresis. The question of whether these findings indicate heterogeneity of γ-globulin in relation to the F and S antigenic components, or whether different antigenic groups on one molecule can give rise to separate lines in certain instances, is discussed...|$|R
40|$|GMZ 2 is {{a fusion}} protein of Plasmodium falciparum {{merozoite}} surface protein 3 (MSP 3) and glutamate rich protein (GLURP) that mediates an immune response against the blood stage of the parasite. Two previous phase I clinical trials, one in naïve European adults and one in malaria-exposed Gabonese adults showed that GMZ 2 was well tolerated and immunogenic. Here, we present data on safety and immunogenicity of GMZ 2 in one to five year old Gabonese children, a target population for future malaria vaccine efficacy trials. Thirty children one to five years of age were randomized to receive three doses of either 30 µg or 100 µg of GMZ 2, or rabies vaccine. GMZ 2, adjuvanted in aluminum hydroxide, was administered on Days 0, 28 and 56. All participants received a full course of their respective vaccination and were followed up for one year. Both 30 µg and 100 µg GMZ 2 vaccine doses were well tolerated and induced antibodies and memory B-cells against GMZ 2 {{as well as its}} <b>antigenic</b> <b>constituents</b> MSP 3 and GLURP. After three doses of vaccine, the geometric mean concentration of antibodies to GMZ 2 was 19 -fold (95 %CI: 11, 34) higher in the 30 µg GMZ 2 group than in the rabies vaccine controls, and 16 -fold (7, 36) higher in the 100 µg GMZ 2 group than the rabies group. Geometric mean concentration of antibodies to MSP 3 was 2. 7 -fold (1. 6, 4. 6) higher in the 30 µg group than in the rabies group and 3. 8 -fold (1. 5, 9. 6) higher in the 100 µg group. Memory B-cells against GMZ 2 developed in both GMZ 2 vaccinated groups. Both 30 µg as well as 100 µg intramuscular GMZ 2 are immunogenic, well tolerated, and safe in young, malaria-exposed Gabonese children. This result confirms previous findings in naïve and malaria-exposed adults and supports further clinical development of GMZ 2. ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 00703066...|$|R
40|$|Auto{{antibodies}} {{are defined}} as antibodies directed against self antigens, i. e., against a normal <b>antigenic</b> endogenous tissue <b>constituent.</b> They can be the immediate cause of the neurological syndrome or be detected as an epiphenomenon of the pathogenic process. Autoantibodies are often considered useful biomarkers {{for the improvement of}} diagnostic accuracy, for the staging of disease progression or for the follow up of a biological response to a therapeutic intervention. The {{purpose of this article is}} to review the autoantibodies that are available to investigate immune-mediated neurological conditions. The detection of some of these autoantibodies may help the clinician to establish a definite diagnosis which may further facilitate the therapeutic decision...|$|R
40|$|Metabolism of {{the human}} {{chorionic}} gonadotrophin (hCG) - and LHbeta-subunits (hCGbeta, LHbeta) terminates with the urinary excretion of core fragment (hCGbetacf, LHbetacf) molecules that retain <b>antigenic</b> shape and <b>constituent</b> N-linked carbohydrate moieties. We have previously demonstrated the resolved mass spectra of hCGbetacf, from which the carbohydrate moieties present at two N-linked glycosylation sites were identified. LHbetacf was subjected to the same mass spectrometric analysis. As LHbeta shares 82 % homology with hCGbeta but possesses only one glycosylation consensus site a simpler spectral fingerprint of LHbetacf glycoforms was expected. LHbetacf was reduced with dithiothreitol and analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Glycoforms were predicted by subtracting the peptide mass from the m/z values of the observed peaks and then sequentially subtracting the masses of the monosaccharide residues of hCGbeta N-linked carbohydrates reported in the literature. The mass spectra of LHbetacf revealed a broad single peak ranging from m/z 8700 to 10 700. Following reduction, this peak {{was replaced by a}} set of partially resolved peaks between m/z 4130 and 5205 corresponding to glycosylated forms of the peptide LHbeta 6 - 40. A peak at m/z 4252. 2 corresponded to the non-glycosylated peptide LHbeta 55 - 93. Remaining peaks indicated that the pooled sample comprised a wide set of glycoforms, contained LHbetacf with two N-linked carbohydrate moieties and indicated evidence of further glycosylation due to amino acid substitution in polymorphic variants. This is evidence that a single nucleotide polymorphism alters the post-translational modification of a protein and hence its structural phenotype...|$|R
