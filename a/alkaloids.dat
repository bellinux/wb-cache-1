5|$|<b>Alkaloids</b> {{are derived}} from various amino acids. Over 3000 known <b>alkaloids</b> exist, {{examples}} include nicotine, caffeine, morphine, cocaine, colchicine, ergolines, strychnine, and quinine. <b>Alkaloids</b> have pharmacological effects on humans and other animals. Some <b>alkaloids</b> can inhibit or activate enzymes, or alter carbohydrate and fat storage by inhibiting the formation phosphodiester bonds involved in their breakdown. Certain <b>alkaloids</b> bind to nucleic acids and can inhibit synthesis of proteins and affect DNA repair mechanisms. <b>Alkaloids</b> can also affect cell membrane and cytoskeletal structure causing the cells to weaken, collapse, or leak, and can affect nerve transmission. Although <b>alkaloids</b> act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly invoke an aversively bitter taste.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} Amarylidaceae genera, Narcissus {{contains}} unique isoquinoline <b>alkaloids.</b> The first alkaloid {{to be identified}} was lycorine, from N. pseudonarcissus in 1877. These are considered a protective adaptation, and are utilised in the classification of species. Nearly 100 <b>alkaloids</b> {{have been identified in}} the genus, about a third of all known Amaryllidaceae <b>alkaloids,</b> although not all species have been tested. Of the nine alkaloid ring types identified in the family, Narcissus species most commonly demonstrate the presence of <b>alkaloids</b> from within the Lycorine (lycorine, galanthine, pluviine) and Homolycorine (homolycorine, lycorenine) groups. Hemanthamine, Tazettine, Narciclasine, Montanine and Galantamine <b>alkaloids</b> are also represented. The alkaloid profile of any plant varies with time, location, and developmental stage. Narcissus also contain fructans and low molecular weight glucomannan in the leaves and plant stems.|$|E

5|$|In agriculture, fungi may {{be useful}} if they {{actively}} compete for nutrients and space with pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria or other fungi via the competitive exclusion principle, or if they are parasites of these pathogens. For example, certain species {{may be used to}} eliminate or suppress the growth of harmful plant pathogens, such as insects, mites, weeds, nematodes, and other fungi that cause diseases of important crop plants. This has generated strong interest in practical applications that use these fungi in the biological control of these agricultural pests. Entomopathogenic fungi can be used as biopesticides, as they actively kill insects. Examples that have been used as biological insecticides are Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium spp, Hirsutella spp, Paecilomyces (Isaria) spp, and Lecanicillium lecanii. Endophytic fungi of grasses of the genus Neotyphodium, such as N. coenophialum, produce <b>alkaloids</b> that are toxic to a range of invertebrate and vertebrate herbivores. These <b>alkaloids</b> protect grass plants from herbivory, but several endophyte <b>alkaloids</b> can poison grazing animals, such as cattle and sheep. Infecting cultivars of pasture or forage grasses with Neotyphodium endophytes is one approach being used in grass breeding programs; the fungal strains are selected for producing only <b>alkaloids</b> that increase resistance to herbivores such as insects, while being non-toxic to livestock.|$|E

5|$|The {{place of}} plants in {{medicine}} was radically altered in the 19th century by {{the application of}} chemical analysis. <b>Alkaloids</b> were isolated from a succession of medicinal plants, starting with morphine from the poppy in 1806, and soon followed by ipecacuanha and strychnos in 1817, quinine from the cinchona tree, and then many others. As chemistry progressed, additional classes of pharmacologically active substances were discovered in medicinal plants. Commercial extraction of purified <b>alkaloids</b> including morphine from medicinal plants began at Merck in 1826. Synthesis of a substance first discovered in a medicinal plant began with salicylic acid in 1853. Around {{the end of the}} 19th century, the mood of pharmacy turned against medicinal plants, as enzymes often modified the active ingredients when whole plants were dried, and <b>alkaloids</b> and glycosides purified from plant material started to be preferred.

40|$|Males of {{the moth}} Cosmosoma myrodora (Arctiidae) acquire pyrrolizidine <b>alkaloid</b> by feeding on the excrescent fluids of certain plants (for instance, Eupatorium capillifolium).
