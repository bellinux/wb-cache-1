5|$|The {{majority}} opinion {{presented by the}} NTSB <b>accident</b> <b>report</b> determined {{that the cause of}} the accident was the TWA flight crew's inability to successfully abort takeoff procedures due to an excess of speed. The NTSB recommended revisions and expansions to airline abort procedures and new FAA regulations defining runway clearance and procedures, taking into account jet engine exhaust. In his minority report, Mr. McAdams' said that he would have found the probable cause of the accident to be the Delta crew's failure to adequately advise the tower of the proximity to the runway, and the tower's failure to request additional and precise information prior to clearing TWA 159 for takeoff.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday, February 7, Murray's father Fred {{arrived in}} Amherst. He told {{investigators}} he and Maura went car-shopping that afternoon and later went {{to dinner with}} a friend of Murray's. Murray dropped her father off at his motel room and, borrowing his Toyota Corolla, she returned to campus to attend a dorm party. She arrived at 10:30 pm. At 2:30 am on Sunday, February 8, she left the party. At 3:30 am, en route to her father's motel, she struck a guardrail on Route 9 in Hadley causing nearly $10,000 worth of damage to her father's car. The responding officer wrote an <b>accident</b> <b>report</b> but there is no documentation of sobriety field tests being conducted. She was driven to her father's motel and stayed in his room the rest of the morning. At 4:49 am, there was a cell phone call placed to Murray's boyfriend from Fred's phone. The participants and content of the phone call are unknown.|$|E

PolicingThe first {{legislation}} on <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> in South Africa was promulgated in 1913 in an ordinance of Transvaal, {{one of the}} four provinces of South Africa at the time. Since then several amendments have been made to {{legislation on}} <b>accident</b> <b>reporting,</b> but <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> has continued to be time consuming and unnecessarily complicated. It seems that technology is not yet utilised to its full potential. Therefore this study investigates ways in which an online application (app) for <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> could be designed and implemented. The development and implementation of a simpler and modern app for online <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> could successfully address the problem of unavailable statistics for minor damage-only accidents. By amending the National Road Traffic Act, 1996 (Act 93 of 1996) to accommodate more cost-effective online <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> through eAccident, the time spent on compiling the current <b>accident</b> <b>reports</b> could be minimised and costly human resources could be utilised more effectively in core police functions such as law enforcement...|$|R

On 17 June 2000, a train derailed at Nelaug Station after an axle broke. The class was grounded for a month, and the investigation showed both design errors, and lack of proper inspection and testing. After they were put back into service, they {{were not allowed to}} use the tilting mechanism—thus not being allowed to run faster than their predecessors. The construction was reinforced, and in 2004, the tilting mechanism was re-enabled along with higher speeds. In 2007, a train derailed on the Bergen Line, and questions were raised about the trains' ability to operate in snow, however the <b>accident</b> <b>report</b> showed that the trains' front axle load was just as able to cope with heavy snow conditions as the locomotives running on the line, and that the derailment would have been more severe if the same conditions would hit a normal train with less secure connections between carriages. On 16 June 2011, two units were destroyed when the train ran into a fire in a snow tunnel at Hallingskeid Station.|$|E

This {{research}} explored {{ways in which}} the process of road traffic <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> in the Johannesburg metropole could be enhanced. The specific objectives were to systematically examine the process of road traffic <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> and to focus on an analysis of (1) the time it takes the relevant authorities to complete the various activities involved in reporting road traffic accidents; (2) the quality of completed road traffic accident reports; and (3) the general experiences of drivers involved in road traffic accidents regarding the system of road traffic <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> and information retrieval in the Johannesburg metropole; to draft guidelines for strengthening the process of road traffic <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> in the research area, based on the mentioned analysis; and to provide pointers for future research. The study adopted a systems perspective on road traffic <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> and took cognisance of the wider road traffic safety management and transportation context in South Africa. The findings underlined that (1) the time taken to <b>report</b> road traffic <b>accidents</b> in the Johannesburg metropole tended to be unacceptably long; and that (2) <b>accident</b> <b>reports</b> tended to be inaccurate and/or incomplete.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{behavioral}} factors underlying the reporting intentions of cycling accidents. The proposed analytical framework is an adapted {{version of the}} Theory of Planned Behavior accounting for the linkage between attitudes and the perceived difficulties, {{in order to understand}} the barriers impeding cycling <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> intentions. The barriers consist of attitudes that <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> is useless, preference to allocate time to other activities, concerns about family distress and social image, distrust in the police, and medical consultation aversion. The framework was validated by means of a survey, which yielded 1, 512 complete responses from cyclists. The estimated structural equation model revealed: (i) the perceived difficulties are related to reporting intentions, attitudes that <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> is useless, and the preference to allocate time to other activities; (ii) medical consultation aversion has a higher weight than distrust in the police in demotivating cycling <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> intentions; (iii) the latent factors are mainly related to socio-economic characteristics and last cycling accident characteristics; (iv) information provision regarding the societal benefits of <b>accident</b> <b>reporting</b> is important for increasing the reporting rate...|$|R

40|$|This {{study has}} {{investigated}} {{factors that contribute}} to the rise of accidents in the Swedish Armed Forces. Through investigation of six <b>accident</b> <b>reports</b> human factors have been identified, classi-fied and compiled. The aim has been to seek answers to the question: Which human factors cause accidents in the Swedish Armed Forces' activities at sea? In the context of a case study the content of six <b>accident</b> <b>reports,</b> which were linked to the Swedish Armed Forces, was analysed. Documentary research was used to collect data. The analysis of collected <b>accident</b> <b>reports</b> was carried out with content analysis. A total of 134 human factors were identified in this study, compiled from 31 unique human factors. The results drawn from studying the survey concluded that human factors which appear most frequently in the <b>accident</b> <b>reports</b> are routine deviation, judgment, knowledge, sudden event development and communica-tion/information. The results also show that of all the 31 units of human factors identified, no single factor is represented in all <b>accident</b> <b>reports.</b> However, the human factors routine deviation, judgment, communication/information, education, job description and safeguard were repre-sented in five of six reports...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a framework that}} through structured analysis of <b>accident</b> <b>reports</b> explores the differences between practice and academic literature as well amongst organizations regarding their views on human error.

The framework was applied to 52 air <b>accident</b> <b>reports</b> published by the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) and 45 ones issued by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) from 1999 to 2014. Frequency analysis and statistical tests showed that the presence of the aspects in the <b>accident</b> <b>reports</b> varied from 32. 6 % to 81. 7 %, and revealed differences between the ATSB and the DSB approaches to human error.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{examined the}} role of story structure in memory for written aviation <b>accident</b> <b>reports</b> by both pilots and nonpilots. <b>Accident</b> <b>reports</b> follow a standard format providing setting, complication, decision and outcome information. Following the ‘predictive features’ model, {{it was hypothesized that}} expertise would facilitate recall, and that pilots would recall most effectively with the complication feature. Pilot and nonpilot participants read and recalled 4 (Experiment 1) or 8 (Experiment 2) <b>accident</b> <b>reports.</b> With four cases, pilots recalled more than nonpilots, but no difference was found with eight cases. A primacy effect for pattern of recall was found in Experiment 1 with the setting and complication features most effective in triggering case recall. When task difficulty was increased (Experiment 2), the complication feature alone was the most effective. In Experiment 3, we manipulated text structure and found that complication and decision features were better recognized than setting or outcome features by nonpilots. The finding across three studies that the complication feature was consistently the most effective for retrieving aviation <b>accident</b> <b>reports</b> supports the ‘predictive features’ model. 18 page(s...|$|R
