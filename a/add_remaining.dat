Embryos are ready to be photographed. ### 3. Notes 1. Add agar into the water and bring to boil while mixing continuously. Wait for agar to go into solution. Add base before adding grape juice. <b>Add</b> <b>remaining</b> ingredients. Mix thoroughly. Use a beaker with handles to pour hot fly food onto the prepared trays. Let the food cool to room temperature before storing at 4 ° C. - For each step prepare enough reaction mix for 110 reactions per plate. - Hydrate G- 50 plate while running the PCR to save time. - Individual wells are very full and if the plate is not properly sealed contamination can occur. It is best to use 8 -strip PCR caps rather than aluminum plate sealers to prevent cross-contamination. - Resuspension buffer waste must be discarded into properly labeled Formamide waste container. - The nylon membranes must not overlay each other to ensure proper contact with the antibody solution. Therefore, if using more than one nylon membrane per tube, the length of individual membrane sheets should be no more that 11 cm. - Preparation of Controls. Spot 1 µl of each of 5 dilutions (1 : 3. 3, 1 : 10, 1 : 33, 1 : 100, and 1 : 330) of several different probes onto DIG Quantification Teststrips. Take the loaded DIG Quantification Teststrips and a DIG Control Teststrip through the quantification procedure. Evaluate which of the probe dilution series best approaches the control teststrip. Prepare an adequate amount of this probe dilution series and store at - 80 °C for future use. - Cover the Hybaid oven door with aluminum foil. Keep the developed nylon membranes in the dark even after stopping the color reaction, otherwise they will turn completely blue over time. - Developing solution must be discarded into a properly labeled NBT/BCIP waste container. - If the probe spot is at least as intense as the 1 : 330 control spot the RNA probe reaction was successful and the RNA probe is ready to be used in hybridization. - Flies lay better in the dark. Keep the fly cages in a room without windows or cover cages with a light-tight dark cloth. - For maximum egg deposition make sure the fly food trays and yeast paste are at room temperature before placing in the fly cage. - The paste has to be easily spreadable, so that the fly food will not separate from the tray, but not too watery so that the flies will not stick to the paste. - Hybridization assays are conducted usingstaged embryos from 0 to 18 hrs post fertilization. Due to uneven egg deposition during this period, embryos are collected in 3 hr intervals (0 - 3, 3 - 6, 6 - 9, 9 - 12, 12 - 15, 15 - 18) to ensure equal representation of all developmental stages in the master mix made by combining equal amounts of embryos from each 3 hr interval. - Example of Embryo Collection Schedule ![Table 4]([URL] "Table 4 ") Carefully remove any flies that may have stuck to the fly food or the yeast paste to prevent further egg deposition. While removing the flies take care not to damage the deposited embryos. 17. Pour enough deionized H 20 on the tray to cover the entire area. Use paintbrush to collect the embryos from the tray and carefully pour them into the prepared three level sieve. The first sieve (20) will collect pieces of loose agar, the second sieve(40) will collect loose fly parts (e. g. abdomens, wings and heads) and the third sieve will collect the clean embryos. 18. Must be large enough to contain one level of the sieve and high enough so that the embryos in the sieve are can be submerged in liquid. (e. g. 100 % bleach, deionized H 20). 19. Timing of this step is critical. If the embryos are left in bleach for too long they will be irreparably damaged. 20. Heptane must be discarded into a properly labeled heptane waste container. 21. Formaldehyde/PBS mixture must be prepared fresh just prior to use. Formaldehyde is a classified as a human carcinogen and should be handled with caution and discarded into a properly labeled Formaldehyde waste container. 22. When removing the upper (heptane) phase, start at the interphase and work your way up. Use Falcon Pipetaid. 23. Good embryos, unbroken embryos devoid of chorion and vitelline membranes, will sink to the bottom. Embryos remaining at interphase are damaged and should not be used in hybridization. 24. Methanol must be discarded into a properly labeled methanol waste container. 25. Do not put more than 7 ml of embryos in a 50 ml falcon tube. Lay the falcon tube on its side to prevent crushing the embryos. 26. The embryo master mix is created by combining equal volumes of embryos of all collected stages. It is best to measure out the individual stages in an eppendorf tube and then transfer individual time intervals into a prepared falcon tube. Let the embryos settle to ensure equal volumes. Easiest way to transfer the embryos is by turning the eppendorf tube upside down above the falcon tube and washing out the embryos with methanol using the pipetaid. 27. Waste from steps 3, 4 and 5 of the hybridization protocol (3. 2. 3) must be discarded into a properly labeled Formaldehyde waste container. 28. Use 12 ml total (9 ml methanol, 2. 88 ml PBS, 120 ul formaldehyde) -prepare fresh just before starting the hybridization steps. 29. Use 12 ml total (3 ml methanol, 8. 64 ml PBS, 360 ul formaldehyde) - prepare fresh just before starting the hybridization steps. 30. Use 12 ml total (11. 52 ml PBS, 480 ul formaldehyde) - prepare fresh just before starting the hybridization steps. 31. Hybridization buffer with and without dextran sulfate and wash buffer must be discarded into a properly labeled Formamide waste container. 32.

We show that it is NP-hard to find the best head-driven strategy in terms of either the time or space complexity of parsing. © 2011 Association for Computational Linguistics...|$|R
