5|$|Marine fish of many species, such as herring, cod, tuna, {{mackerel}} and <b>anchovy,</b> {{are caught}} commercially, forming {{an important part}} of the diet, including protein and fatty acids, of much of the world's population. A smaller number of species are farmed commercially, including salmon and carp.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{takes place}} in coastal towns, {{especially}} in Gampo-eup in the city's northeast, with 436 registered fishing craft in the city. Fishing industry in Gyeongju is generally in a declined status due to relatively inconvenient transport conditions and lacks of subordinate facilities. Much of the catch from these boats goes direct from the harbor to Gyeongju's many seafood restaurants. Mainly, sauries, anchovies, rays are harvested and {{a small number of}} abalone and wakame farming takes place. Local specialties include myeolchijeot (fermented <b>anchovy),</b> abalone, wakame, and squid.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts are {{economically}} {{important in}} different ways. They are captured for food around the world. A {{small number of}} species such as herring, cod, pollock, <b>anchovy,</b> tuna and mackerel provide people with {{millions of tons of}} food per year, while many other species are fished in smaller amounts. They provide {{a large proportion of the}} fish caught for sport. Commercial and recreational fishing together provide millions of people with employment.|$|E

5|$|DDT {{pollution}} in the environment was {{a major cause of}} decline of brown pelican populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s. It entered the oceanic food web, contaminating and accumulating in several species, including one of the pelican’s primary food fish – the northern <b>anchovy.</b> Its metabolite DDE is a reproductive toxicant in pelicans and many other birds, causing eggshell thinning and weakening, and consequent breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds. Since an effective ban on the use of DDT was implemented in the US in 1972, the eggshells of breeding brown pelicans there have thickened and their populations have largely recovered.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{fin whale}} stomachs sampled off British Columbia between 1963 and 1967, euphausiids {{dominated}} the diet for {{four of the}} five years (82.3 to 100% of the diet), while copepods only formed a major portion of the diet in 1965 (35.7%). Miscellaneous fish, squid, and octopus played only a very minor part of the diet in two of the five years (3.6 to 4.8%). Fin whales caught off California between 1959 and 1970 fed on the pelagic euphausiid Euphausia pacifica (86% of sampled individuals), the more neritic euphausiid Thysanoessa spinifera (9%), and the northern <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis mordax) (7%); only trace amounts (<0.5% each) were found of Pacific saury (C. saira) and juvenile rockfish (Sebastes jordani). In the Gulf of California, they have been observed feeding on swarms of the euphausiid Nyctiphanes simplex.|$|E
5|$|Some 97% of {{the common}} thresher's diet is {{composed}} of bony fishes, mostly small schooling forage fish such as mackerel, bluefish, herring, needlefish, and lanternfish. Before striking, the sharks compact schools of prey by swimming around them and splashing the water with its tail, often in pairs or small groups. Threshers are also known to take large, solitary fishes such as lancetfish, as well as squid and other pelagic invertebrates. Off California, common threshers feed mostly on the northern <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis mordax), with Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus), market squid (Loligo opalescens), and pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes) also being important food items. The sharks concentrate on a few prey species during cold water years, but become less discriminating during less productive, warmer El Niño periods.|$|E

40|$|Extremely halophilic archaea (EHA) {{might play}} an {{important}} role in salted fish production. So far, limited information has been available on the effect of EHA and salt concentration on the safety and quality characteristics of salted <b>anchovies.</b> Eight Halobacterium salinarum strains were isolated from different sea salt samples and subjected to phenotypic and genotypic characterization. The strains were then inoculated into fresh salt before addition to <b>anchovies.</b> A total of 18 experimental productions were performed. The inoculated trials showed the lowest counts of undesired microorganisms. In particular, salted <b>anchovies</b> produced with Hbt. salinarum H 11 showed the lowest histamine concentration as well as the highest sensory scores. Differences in terms of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were estimated among trials. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that experimental production performed with a reduced amount of salt (175 g of sea salt per kg of <b>anchovies)</b> did not affect the final quality of salted <b>anchovies.</b> The strain Hbt. salinarum H 11 produced salted <b>anchovies</b> with well-appreciated organoleptic features. Thus, the addition of EHA and the use of a lower amount of sea salt might represent a valuable alternative to the traditional method for production of salted <b>anchovies...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{wildlife}} on Ford Island {{is likely}} {{very similar to}} that on Naval Station Pearl Harbor. Wildlife is sparse and dominated by invasive species such as the house mouse, mongoose, brown rat, black rat, house sparrow, Java sparrow and common mynah. An endangered owl, the endemic pueo (a subspecies of the short-eared owl), has been seen hunting on the island. Nearly all the plant life on the island is non-native, including edible cacti from California introduced in the late 1700s by Francisco de Paula Marín. The island's harbor was important to ancient Hawaiians for its ample supply of fish, including mullet, milkfish and Hawaiian <b>anchovy.</b> The National Park Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service oversee and administer the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument battlefields at Pearl Harbor and Ford Island.|$|E
5|$|In the North Pacific, {{they feed}} on euphausiids in the genera Euphausia, Thysanoessa, and Nyctiphanes, large copepods in the genus Neocalanus, small {{schooling}} fish (e.g. the genera Engraulis, Mallotus, Clupea, and Theragra), and squid. Based on stomach {{content analysis of}} over 19,500 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the North Pacific from 1952 to 1971, 64.1% contained only krill, 25.5% copepods, 5.0% fish, 3.4% krill and copepods and 1.7% squid. Nemoto (1959) analysed the stomach contents of about 7500 fin whales caught in the northern North Pacific and Bering Sea from 1952 to 1958, found that they mainly preyed on euphausiids around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska and schooling fish in the northern Bering Sea and off Kamchatka. In the northern Bering Sea (north of 58°N), their main prey species were capelin (Mallotus villosus), Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii); they also consumed saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis). Arctic krill (Thysanoessa raschii) was the only species of euphausiid found in the stomachs of fin whales in the northern Bering Sea. Off Kamchatka, they appeared to primarily feed on herring. They also took large quantities of the copepod Neocalanus cristatus around the Aleutian Islands and in Olyutorsky Bay off northeast Kamchatka, areas where the species was abundant. Five species of euphausiid (Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa spinifera, T. inermis, T. raschii, and T. longipes) were the predominant prey around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska. Prey varied by region in the Kuril Islands area, with euphausiids (T. longipes, T. inermis, and T. raschii) and copepods (Neocalanus plumchrus and N. cristatus) being the main prey in the northern area and Japanese flying squid (Todarodes pacificus pacificus) and small schooling fish (e.g. Pacific saury, Cololabis saira; and Japanese <b>anchovy,</b> Engraulis japonicus) dominating the diet in the southern area.|$|E
25|$|Life-stage specific: Lasker’s {{suggestion}} that storms ultimately have negative impacts on first-feeding <b>anchovy</b> larvae should {{come with the}} disclaimer that this applies only to first-feeding larvae entering the critical period.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>anchovies</b> (Stelophorus spp) in the Spermonde coastal waters, Pangkep, was studied from satellite remotely sensed environment and catch data, using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Generalized Additive Model (GAM). The {{goal of this}} preliminary {{study was to investigate}} the relationship between sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration (SSC), and <b>anchovies</b> distribution. To describe their relationship, SST and SSC derived from Aqua/MODIS satellite were overlain with the positions of experimental fishing by local fishermen???s lift net (???Bagan perahu???). The experimental lift net operations were conducted in April to May 2008. The findings of this study showed that most of the <b>anchovies</b> distribution occurred in the coastal area. <b>Anchovies</b> distribution tended to be highest in the specific temperature of 28. 8 - 29. 3 oC and chlorophyll-a of 1. 5 ??? 2. 5 mg. m- 3. Furthermore, the SST and SSC in the coastal waters of Spermonde play a great role in determining the variability of the <b>anchovies</b> quantitative distribution in the study area. The results were supported by GAM prediction. Due to lack of robust data, there is no detailed information on the optimum habitat preference of <b>anchovies.</b> Future work is needed to reveal the preferred habitat of <b>anchovies</b> with the consideration of more oceanographic parameters...|$|R

25|$|He {{observed}} that <b>anchovy</b> larvae would first feed only when introduced to layers from {{below the surface}} containing high levels of chlorophyll and certain species of phytoplankton. These feeding-suitable phytoplankton assemblages were correlated with non-mixing thermocline layers. This conjecture was supported when foul weather swept up during the study and mixed the previously stratified layers (including a particulate layer below the surface) that had been sampled and introduced to the larvae. Samples derived from the same depths that proved ideal to induce first feeding prior to the storm no longer contained the necessary phytoplankton varieties and abundances; as a result, the young larvae did not feed on the post-storm samples and were unable to survive. Thus, Lasker eventually hypothesized that high-energy events that cause destratification of ocean layers have negative impacts on first-feeding northern <b>anchovy</b> larvae by destabilizing and decreasing their prey availability.|$|E
