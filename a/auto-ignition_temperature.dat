This was in order to obviate any errors arising from deficiencies in the spectral scaling laws which are commonly used to represent nitrogen Q-branch CARS spectra at high pressure. The spectra obtained in the engine were compared with spectra obtained in a calibrated high pressure, high temperature cell, using direct cross-correlation {{in place of the}} minimisation of sums of squares of residuals. The technique is demonstrated through the measurement of air temperature as a function of crankshaft angle inside the cylinder of a motored single-cylinder Ricardo E 6 research engine, followed by the measurement of fuel-air mixture temperatures obtained during the compression stroke in a knocking Ricardo E 6 engine.

In this concept {{a more or less}} homogenous air fuel mixture is compressed to auto-ignition. This gives a good fuel economy compared to a normal SI engine and it has a positive impact on exhaust emissions. In the study presented here negative valve overlap (NVO) was used to initiate HCCI combustion by increasing the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and thus retaining sufficient thermal energy to reach <b>auto-ignition</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and raising the temperature during the NVO sufficiently to allow reactions to occur when a pilot injection was made prior to the NVO. The focus of the investigation was on the resulting high temperature reactions. Since OH radicals are associated with high temperature reactions, the reactions were followed by monitoring planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) of OH, using a dye laser and an intensified LaVision Dynamight camera. The presence of OH radicals detected during the negative valve overlap indicates that high temperature reactions do occur in the highly diluted environment of the trapped exhaust gases during the NVO. Reactions were identified from 20 CAD prior to TDC (during the NVO) and to around 60 CAD after TDC, with the intensity peak at about TDC...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{elucidate}} the processes controlling the auto-ignition timing and overall combustion duration in homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines, {{the distribution of}} the auto-ignition sites, in both space and time, was studied. The auto-ignition locations were investigated using optical diagnosis of HCCI combustion, based on laser induced fluorescence (LIF) measurements of formaldehyde in an optical engine with fully variable valve actuation. This engine was operated in two different modes of HCCI. In the first, <b>auto-ignition</b> <b>temperatures</b> were reached by heating the inlet air, while in the second, residual mass from the previous combustion cycle was trapped using a negative valve overlap. The fuel was introduced directly into the combustion chamber in both approaches. To complement these experiments, 3 -D numerical modeling of the gas exchange and compression stroke events was done for both HCCI-generating approaches. The STAR CD code was applied to predict the distributions of the local mixture temperature, residual gas fraction (RGF) and equivalence ratio throughout the cylinder {{at the end of the}} compression stroke. Knowledge of these distributions is important as they are strongly affect the ignition timing and burn duration of the HCCI combustion. Selected points from the calculated distribution maps were used as initial conditions for 0 -D detailed-chemistry calculations, using the SENKIN code to identify combinations of properties that lead to first auto-ignition. Tracing corresponding points back to the STAR CD mesh gave information about the location of the auto-ignition sites. Results obtained in this way corresponded well to the auto-ignition locations derived from optical measurements...|$|R

Possible options include homogeneous lean charge spark ignition (HLCSI), stratified charge spark ignition (SCSI) and homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), all of which are intended to reduce pumping and thermal losses. In the work presented here four different combustion strategies were evaluated using the same engine: SSI, HLCSI, SCSI and HCCI. HLCSI was achieved by early injection and operating the engine lean, close to its stability limits. SCSI was achieved using the sprayguided technique with a centrally placed multi-hole injector and spark-plug. HCCI was achieved using a negative valve overlap to trap hot residuals and thus generate <b>auto-ignition</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{at the end of the}} compression stroke. The experiments were performed using a 6 cylinder, 3. 2 liter Volvo engine equipped with cam profile switching (CPS), variable cam timing (VCT) for both intake and exhaust valves, and a spray guided direct injection (SGDI) system. In conjunction with a fully programmable control unit these features allowed the engine to be run in all the tested modes without any hardware modifications. Five operating points in the low load/speed zone of the engine map were optimized for fuel consumption using full factorial, 2 -D and 3 -D experimental designs (with centre points).

40|$|The {{effects of}} using an SI {{stratified}} charge {{in combination with}} HCCI combustion on combustion phasing, {{rate of heat release}} and emissions were investigated in engine experiments to identify ways to extend the operational range of HCCI combustion to lower loads. In the experiments an optical single-cylinder engine equipped with a piezo electric outward-opening injector and operated with negative valve overlap (NVO) and low lift, short duration, camshaft profiles, was used to initiate HCCI combustion by increasing the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and thus retaining sufficient thermal energy to reach <b>auto-ignition</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Two series of experiments with full factorial designs were performed, to investigate how the tested parameters (amounts of fuel injected in pilot injections and main injections, stratification injection timing and spark-assistance) influenced the combustion. In the optical study fourth harmonic light (266 nm) from a Nd:YAG laser was used to induce fluorescence (LIF), from 3 -pentanone added as a fuel tracer, to analyze the concentration and distribution of fuel vapor within the cylinder. In addition third harmonic light (355 nm) was used to study the concentration and distribution of formaldehyde in the cylinder, and chemiluminescence signals from OH radicals were used to locate the flame front. It was found that the injection and ignition timing of the SI stratified charge were the main parameters influencing the HCCI combustion phasing. The NOX emissions were found to be significantly affected by the use of a SI stratified charge, and its injection timing. The results show that use of an SI stratified charge can extend the operational range of HCCI combustion to lower loads by advancing combustion phasing. In addition, use of NVO in combination with an SI stratified charge provides a useful, flexible means to control HCCI combustion...|$|R

40|$|Presently, the {{research}} on the homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines has gained importance {{in the field of}} automotive power applications due to its superior efficiency and low emissions compared to the conventional internal combustion (IC) engines. In principle, the HCCI uses premixed lean homogeneous charge that auto-ignites volumetrically throughout the cylinder. The homogeneous mixture preparation is the main key to achieve high fuel economy and low exhaust emissions from the HCCI engines. In the recent past, different techniques to prepare homogeneous mixture have been explored. The major problem associated with the HCCI is to control the auto-ignition over wide range of engine operating conditions. The control strategies for the HCCI engines were also explored. This dissertation investigates the utilization of ethanol, a potential major contributor to the fuel economy of the future. Port fuel injection (PFI) strategy was used to prepare the homogeneous mixture external to the engine cylinder in a constant speed, single cylinder, four stroke air cooled engine which was operated on HCCI mode. Seven modules of work have been proposed and carried out in this research work to establish the results of using ethanol as a potential fuel in the HCCI engine. Ethanol has a low Cetane number and thus it cannot be auto-ignited easily. Therefore, intake air preheating was used to achieve <b>auto-ignition</b> <b>temperatures.</b> In the first module of work, the ethanol fueled HCCI engine was thermodynamically analysed to determine the operating domain. The minimum intake air temperature requirement to achieve auto-ignition and stable HCCI combustion was found to be 130 °C. Whereas, the knock limit of the engine limited the maximum intake air temperature of 170 °C. Therefore, the intake air temperature range was fixed between 130 - 170 °C for the ethanol fueled HCCI operation. In the second module of work, experiments were conducted with the variation of intake air temperature from 130 - 170 °C at a regular interval of 10 °C. It was found that, the increase in the intake air temperature advanced the combustion phase and decreased the exhaust gas temperature. At 170 °C, the maximum combustion efficiency and thermal efficiency were found to be 98. 2...|$|R

50|$|The most {{hazardous}} {{property of}} acetone is its extreme flammability. At temperatures greater than acetone's flash point of -20 C, air mixtures of between 2.5% and 12.8% acetone, by volume, may explode or cause a flash fire.

Static discharge may also ignite acetone vapors, though acetone {{has a very}} high ignition initiation energy point and therefore accidental ignition is rare. Even pouring or spraying acetone over red-glowing coal will not ignite it, due to the high concentration of vapour and the cooling effect of evaporation of the liquid. It auto-ignites at 465 C. <b>Auto-ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> is also dependent upon the exposure time, thus at some tests it is quoted as 525 °C.

50|$|A thermobaric bomb's {{effective}} yield requires {{the most appropriate}} combination {{of a number of}} factors; among these are how well the fuel is dispersed, how rapidly it mixes with the surrounding atmosphere, and the initiation of the igniter and its position relative to the container of fuel. In some designs, strong munitions cases allow the blast pressure to be contained long enough for the fuel to be heated up well above its <b>auto-ignition</b> <b>temperature,</b> so that once the container bursts the super-heated fuel will auto-ignite progressively as it comes into contact with atmospheric oxygen.Conventional upper and lower limits of flammability apply to such weapons. Close in, blast from the dispersal charge, compressing and heating the surrounding atmosphere, will have some influence on the lower limit. The upper limit has been demonstrated strongly to influence the ignition of fogs above pools of oil. This weakness may be eliminated by designs where the fuel is preheated well above its ignition temperature, so that its cooling during its dispersion still results in a minimal ignition delay on mixing. The continual combustion of the outer layer of fuel molecules as they come into contact with the air, generates additional heat which maintains the temperature of the interior of the fireball, and thus sustains the detonation.|$|E

40|$|A combined-cycle {{power plant}} is {{described}} that uses (1) heat from a high-temperature nuclear reactor to meet base-load electrical demands and (2) {{heat from the}} same high-temperature reactor and burning natural gas, jet fuel, or hydrogen to meet peak-load electrical demands. For base-load electricity production, fresh air is compressed; then flows through a heat exchanger, where it is heated to between 700 and 900 C by heat provided by a high-temperature nuclear reactor via an intermediate heat-transport loop; and finally exits through a high-temperature gas turbine to produce electricity. The hot exhaust from the Brayton-cycle gas turbine is then fed to a {{heat recovery steam generator}} that provides steam to a steam turbine for added electrical power production. To meet peak electricity demand, the air is first compressed and then heated with the heat from a high-temperature reactor. Natural gas, jet fuel, or hydrogen is then injected into the hot air in a combustion chamber, combusts, and heats the air to 1300 C-the operating conditions for a standard natural-gas-fired combined-cycle plant. The hot gas then flows through a gas turbine and a heat recovery steam generator before being sent to the exhaust stack. The higher temperatures increase the plant efficiency and power output. If hydrogen is used, it can be produced at night using energy from the nuclear reactor and stored until needed. With hydrogen serving as the auxiliary fuel for peak power production, the electricity output to the electric grid can vary from zero (i. e., when hydrogen is being produced) to the maximum peak power while the nuclear reactor operates at constant load. Because nuclear heat raises air <b>temperatures</b> above the <b>auto-ignition</b> <b>temperatures</b> of the various fuels and powers the air compressor, the power output can be varied rapidly (compared with the capabilities of fossil-fired turbines) to meet spinning reserve requirements and stabilize the electric grid. This combined cycle uses the unique characteristics of high-temperature reactors (T> 700 C) to produce electricity for premium electric markets whose demands can not be met by other types of nuclear reactors. It may also make the use of nuclear reactors economically feasible in smaller electrical grids, such as those found in many developing countries. The ability to rapidly vary power output can be used to stabilize electric grid performance-a particularly important need in small electrical grids...|$|R

Two dimensional direct numerical simulation (2 D DNS) and one dimensional (1 D) detailed simulations of flame/spontaneous ignition interaction in a lean hydrogen/air mixture under a constant volume enclosure relevant to SACI engine conditions are performed using detailed chemistry and detailed transport properties. In a 2 D outward propagating spherical flame, thermal-diffusive instability is observed and once auto-ignition starts a low temperature region in the preheat zone of the flame is formed. Subsequently, the ignition in the preheat zone is suppressed. Then 1 D flame/ignition interactions in H 2 /air, syngas/air and methane/air mixtures are studied using detailed numerical simulations. The results reveal that due to preferential diffusion of hydrogen, heat and mass transfer in the preheat zone inhibits the ignition process, yielding a slower reaction rate hence an even lower temperature in the region.

Hydrocarbon refrigerants are natural compounds, which do not damage the ozone layer, and have very little impact on global warming. The use of a simple hydrocarbon, propane, as a refrigerant is becoming increasingly popular these days due to its high heat capacity and its short lifetime in the atmosphere.

This was a stepwise procedure where the first part was to apply the quasi steady-state assumption (QSSA) on HCCI-calculations, where a measure of the species life-time was used to determine which species should be considered as steady-state species. The method showed a good agreement compared to the original mechanism, even for a relatively large degree of reduction. Sensitivity analysis and reaction flow analysis was combined in a semi-automatic method to generate skeletal mechanisms. The skeletal mechanisms give a good agreement, but only for a limited degree of reduction. A fully automatic method for reduction over a selected range of physical parameters was developed. It combines the two methods by applying QSSA on an automatically generated skeletal mechanism. The suggested method showed good agreement and an excellent potential for future tailor made reaction mechanisms, using a detailed reaction mechanism as a basis. A reaction mechanism for formaldehyde, methane and methanol was developed. The aim for this work was to produce a C 1 mechanism of general characteristics, covering formaldehyde, methane, and possible methanol, giving correct species profiles for intermediate products. The mechanism was capable of accurately predicting ignition delays for formaldehyde and methane over a wide range, gave decent methanol auto-ignition prediction, and could further accurately predict the species profiles for formaldehyde but was not capable of calculating flame speeds for methane. A semi-detailed reaction mechanism for Primary Reference Fuels, mixtures of iso-octane and n-heptane, was developed. The predictions of ignition delay times showed a good agreement to experiments. The mechanism proved to be numerically efficient compared to mechanisms of equivalent accuracy...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{computational}} fluid dynamics (CFD) simulationsof diesel engine combustion of unconventional fuels. The fuels are: A diesel/gasoline blend, di-methyltetrahydrofurane (2 -MTHF), a blend of 2 -MTHF and di-n-butylether (DnBE), n-octane, DnBE, and n-octanol. Experimental data from two different diesel engine test benches are available for comparison and validation of the simulations. Good results regarding pressure traces, heat release rates, and pollutant emissions are obtained. Fuel property effects are analyzed individually and detailed insights into the interdependencies of fuel molecular structure and combustion behavior are gained. Simulations are perfomed using the Representative Interactive Flamelet (RIF) model, which has been applied in many studies modeling compression ignitionin internal combustion engines. By the use of detailed chemical reaction mechanisms, the RIF model inherently accounts for low and high <b>temperature</b> <b>auto-ignition,</b> heat release, and pollutant formation. For simulation of the novel fuels in this study, the modeling approaches had to be adapted and assumptions had to be reassessed. To validate the spray representation and to set the model parameters of the liquid breakup model, simulations of a spray vessel experiment using several fuels are performed and compared to the respective experimental data. The first fuel to be analyzed by simulation and experiment is a diesel/gasoline blend. Here, the experimental aim {{is to reduce the}} ignitability of the fuel to enable longer premixing duration and thus low temperature combustion. This presents a step towards tailoring a fuel’s properties to the requirementsof the combustion system. A surrogate fuel blend is used to describe there action chemistry of the diesel/gasoline blend, which is a common modeling approach for complex liquid hydrocarbon fuels. The surrogate composition is chosen to match several kinetic properties of the fuel blend. Increased emissions of carbon monoxide and rather high emissions of nitrogen oxides are observed experimentally. The simulations show where these originate, how this is related to the modified fuel properties, and how the emissions could possibly be reduced. The next two fuels in this study are neat di-methyltetrahydrofurane (2 -MTHF) and a blend of 2 -MTHF and di-n-butylether (DnBE). As biofuel candidates, these fuels have a very promising performance in the diesel engine experiments. Their reaction chemistry is described by a surrogate mixture, which represents a new aspect to a reaction chemistry surrogate. Here, not a mixture of hundreds or thousands of hydrocarbons is modeled by a reducedset of fuels, like for the diesel/gasoline blend above, but one single and one dual component fuel with only roughly known reaction chemistry are modeled by a well defined mixture of fuel components. The methodology to define this mixture is described in detail. Comparisons with diesel engine experiments and homogeneous reactor experiments confirm the approach and the methodology to define the surrogate composition, and demonstrate that the approach allows for insights into the pollutant formation processes in the engine. The final set of fuels in this study are three n-C 8 fuels, namely n-octane, DnBE, and n-octanol. These fuels feature very similar molecular structures, but very different spray formation, ignition, and combustion properties. As such, they present an example to understand the influence of small changes in molecular structure on the combustion behavior. For the simulations oft hese fuels, detailed reaction mechanisms are used. Results are analyzed to investigate the effects of mixture formation, fuel stoichiometry, and reaction chemistry individually. Pollutant emissions are found to be mainly dependent on the time available for premixing of the charge, as reflected by the cetaneratings of the fuels. The substantially lower cetane rating of n-octanol compared to n-octane is explained by analysis of engine simulations and homogeneous reactor calculations. These fuels have similar ignition delay times in homogeneous reactor experiments, but quite different ignition behavior in engine relevant conditions. This is shown to be a strong effect of the fuel’s stoichiometries, rather than being related to the very different spray properties of the fuels...|$|R
