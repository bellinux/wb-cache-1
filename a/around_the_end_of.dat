5|$|<b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century, the {{increase}} in coal mining and steel works around Wales led to the immigration of Italian workers. The workers brought families who integrated their culture into Welsh society, bringing with them Italian ice cream and Italian cafes, now a staple of Welsh society.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{dominance}} of rugby union {{there have been few}} football teams of note {{in the history of the}} Rhondda Valleys. Several teams were formed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century, but most folded during the depression, including Cwmparc F.C. in 1926 and Mid-Rhondda in 1928. The most successful club from the area is Ton Pentre F.C..|$|E
5|$|Emperor Manuel {{dispatched}} sebastos George Palaiologos {{to escort}} Béla to the Byzantine Empire. Béla arrived in Constantinople <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> 1163. He was renamed to Alexios, {{and received the}} title of despotes ("lord"), which only emperors had used before that time. Béla's betrothal to the emperor's daughter was also officially announced.|$|E

5|$|By 1846, {{the station}} was already very busy, {{handling}} trains from Wigan and the south, Bolton, Fleetwood, Blackpool, Lancaster and the north, and Blackburn. There were no footbridges; passengers had to cross the lines escorted by station staff. North of {{the station was}} a network of goods lines <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Lancaster Canal. The coal yards and sidings here continued to operate long after the canal had fallen into commercial disuse.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's first {{literary}} {{project was}} his Journal and Remarks {{on the natural}} history of the expedition, now known as The Voyage of the Beagle. In it he expanded his diary notes into a section on this theory, emphasising how {{the presence or absence of}} coral reefs and atolls can show whether the ocean bed is elevating or subsiding. At the same time he was privately speculating intensively about transmutation of species, and taking on other projects. He finished writing out his journal <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> September, but then had the work of correcting proofs.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} many years since position-specific residue {{preference}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> a helix was revealed. However, all the existing secondary structure prediction methods did not exploit this preference feature, {{resulting in low}} accuracy in predicting <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> secondary structures. In this study, we collected a relatively large data set consisting of 1860 high-resolution, non-homology proteins from the PDB, and further analyzed <b>the</b> residue distributions <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> regular secondary structures. It was found that there exist position-specific residue preferences (PSRP) <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> not only helices but also strands. Based on the unique features, we proposed a novel strategy and developed a tool named E-SSpred that treats the secondary structure {{as a whole and}} builds models to predict entire secondary structure segments directly by integrating relevant features. In E-SSpred, the support vector machine (SVM) method is adopted to model and predict <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> helices and strands according to the unique residue distributions around them. A simple linear discriminate analysis method is applied to model and predict entire secondary structure segments by integrating end-prediction results, tri-peptide composition, and length distribution features of secondary structures, as well as the prediction results of the most famous program PSIPRED. The results of fivefold cross-validation on a widely used data set demonstrate that the accuracy of E-SSpred in predicting <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> secondary structures is about 10 % higher than PSIPRED, and the overall prediction accuracy (Q 3 value) of E-SSpred (82. 2 %) is also better than PSIPRED (80. 3 %).

5|$|Upon commissioning, both {{ships were}} {{assigned}} to the 2nd Division of the Home Fleet and Hercules became the flagship of the division. The 2nd Division was renamed the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS) on 1 May 1912. The sisters participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead. <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the year, Colossus was transferred to the 1st BS. Hercules became a private ship in early 1913 and joined her sister in the 1st BS two months later.|$|E
5|$|While the {{earliest}} megalodon remains were reported from the Late Oligocene dated to around 28 {{million years ago}} (mya), competing figures still exist as to when it evolved, such as 16 mya and 23 mya.

25|$|Carbon {{composition}} resistors (CCR) {{consist of}} a solid cylindrical resistive element with embedded wire leads or metal end caps to which the lead wires are attached. The body of the resistor is protected with paint or plastic. Early 20th-century carbon composition resistors had uninsulated bodies; the lead wires were wrapped <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resistance element rod and soldered.

5|$|Hemming's Cartulary is a {{manuscript}} cartulary, or collection of charters and other land records, collected by a monk named Hemming {{around the time}} of the Norman Conquest of England. The manuscript comprises two separate cartularies that were made at different times and later bound together; it is in the British Library as MS Cotton Tiberius A xiii. The first was composed at the end of the 10th or beginning of the 11th century. The second section was compiled by Hemming and was written <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the 11th or the beginning of the 12th century. The first section, traditionally titled the Liber Wigorniensis, is a collection of Anglo-Saxon charters and other land records, most of which are organized geographically. The second section, Hemming's Cartulary proper, combines charters and other land records with a narrative of deprivation of property owned by the church of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|In 1438, {{another of}} John Manners' sons, Robert, {{inherited}} the castle and the estates. The lands {{had fallen in}} value considerably over the preceding years, {{as a result of}} the wars with the Scots, the feuding with the Herons and the poverty of the lands. Robert's son, another Robert Manners, inherited the property in 1464, and passed the castle onto his son, George, on his death in 1495. George inherited the title of Baron de Ros from his mother's side of the family and the castle was abandoned as a residence by the family <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the 15th century when the Manners moved closer to the royal court.|$|E
5|$|In late 1931, {{the state}} {{transferred}} US31 {{to a new}} routing between the St. Joseph and South Haven areas; in the process, the former route of US31 between Watervliet and South Haven was redesignated as M-140. The highway was extended southward from Watervliet to the Niles area in late 1934 or early 1935. The concurrency between M-62 and M-140 was eliminated <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> 1957 when the former highway was truncated to terminate east of Eau Claire instead of continuing west into town. At {{the end of the}} 1950s, the route north of Watervliet to the county line was realigned, smoothing several sharp curves.|$|E
40|$|Experience {{has shown}} {{that one of the}} most common reasons {{permeable}} reactive barriers (PRBs) fail to meet performance criteria is inadequate understanding of the groundwater flow system. For example, contaminated water may flow <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barrier or funnelling slurry walls, under the barrier walls, or through the slurry walls. An analysis of the groundwater flow regime resulting from the installation of a PRB can lead to an effective design that significantly reduces the escape of untreated water through associated slurry walls and/ or <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PRB system. A three-dimensional groundwater flow model using Modflow was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of groundwater capture and treatment resulting from the installation of a funnel-and-gate PRB. The results of the model analysis provided for a design that incorporated several barrier and gate segments at varying orientations to groundwater flow for optimization groundwater capture. The model indicated the ideal location for gates to minimize head increases along the upgradient portion of the slurry wall, which resulted (as compared to a more simplistic design) in reduced seepage of untreated groundwater through the wall and reduced flow <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barrier by an estimated 100 per cent. The length of the gates were also optimized to provide sufficient resident time of groundwater in the PRB to accomplish treatment. The model results were also used to locate optimum sites for downgradient monitor wells to assess performance of the system. Key words: barrier, reactive, modeling, PR...|$|R
