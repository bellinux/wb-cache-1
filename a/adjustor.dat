40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} secure the policyholders against losses due to {{earthquakes}} that are common natural calamities in Taiwan, the government launched a residential earthquake insurance system several years ago. Policyholders can be indemnified by total loss claim for quake-related losses of property. Despite {{there are many other}} professionals involved in the assessment procedure for total loss claim, the qualified <b>adjustors</b> from underwriters are pivotal to the assessment of total loss claims. The qualified <b>adjustors</b> are personnel of non-life insurance companies that underwent training courses for earthquake building damage assessment {{and many of them are}} not professionals in civil engineering. Their determination of total loss claims are based on claim standard operation procedure (SOP) established by Taiwan Residential Earthquake Insurance Fund (TREIF) and mainly relies on personal experience and knowledge of earthquake building damages. Furthermore, considering that reinforced concrete buildings account for more than 76 % effective policies in Taiwan, a quantified loss model for total loss claim determination for RC buildings has been developed in 2009. In this paper, we developed an information system based on the quantified loss model and claims SOP that includes a total loss claim determination system (TLCDS) for qualified <b>adjustors</b> of insurance companies and a centralized database management system (TLDBMS) for TREIF. Claims handling procedure, related forms and the quantified model for determining total loss claims are discussed in the paper. It is believed the proposed information system will be helpful to enhance the efficiency and quality of damage assessment and total loss claim handling operation...|$|R

40|$|Selective {{modification}} of surface and bulk V 5 +/V 4 + ratios in Mo-V-Te-O catalysts {{has been achieved}} using nitric acid and saturated ammonia solutions as pH <b>adjustors.</b> The addition of nitric acid strongly suppressed V 4 + in the bulk but encouraged it on the surface. Because the bulk-phase compositions of Mo-V-Te-O catalysts varied only slightly, {{the changes in the}} catalytic performance for selective propane oxidation to acrolein resulted mainly from the variation of the bulk and surface V 5 +/V 4 + ratios. The high concentration of surface V 5 + that was responsible for propane activation led to high selectivity of propylene and high conversion of propane. Increased bulk V 4 + might result in oxygen vacancies, which promote the electron and oxygen transfer so as to increase the selectivity of deep oxidation products (COx). A low bulk V 4 + concentration prefers selective oxidation products; the yield of acrolein was as high as 21. 4 %. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Global {{demand for}} corn is {{projected}} to rise {{in the coming decades}} to meet the food and fuel requirements of an increasing human population. Technological innovations have significantly improved corn yields over the past few decades; however, corn production is continually limited by unfavorable weather conditions. Extreme weather events put pressure on producers, <b>adjustors,</b> and consultants to make quick management decisions to maintain the highest return on their investment. Proper management decisions require an understanding of plant response and practical ways of applying this knowledge under real world conditions. ^ The following document was written after completing a six-month internship at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln conducting research and extension activities focused on cropping systems. A number of key issues emerged during the internship and a literature review address those topics (Chapter 1). This internship provided experience on the integration of cover crops in corn, corn hybrid response to greensnap damage, and specifically focused on early-season hail damage and primary ear removal in corn. These last two projects are addressed extensively in this document (Chapters 2 - 3). ^ The purpose of this research was to generate experiences in translating scientific information to consultants, educators, industry, crop insurance <b>adjustors,</b> media outlets, and producers. In addition, developing different methods of Extension programming and interaction with clientele allowed for a better understanding of key barriers in translating scientific information. The combination of research and Extension experiences in this document, as well as the history of the Cooperative Extension Service {{led to the formation of}} my future vision for Extension (Chapter 4). Extension must be strongly centered on issues that are important to its clientele. The technological and intellectual capabilities of today’s producers provides Extension with the opportunity to engage them in the problem-solving process through on-farm research. Such strategies allow specialists to understand how solutions interact with producer management strategies. In addition, real world demonstration plots addressing multidisciplinary issues provide a foundation for in depth conversations on underlying causes of key issues in agriculture. Lastly, technologies, such as time-lapse photography and GoPro video cameras, provide an opportunity to overcome key barriers to education. ...|$|R

30|$|Another {{finding was}} that Asian {{ethnicity}} {{was associated with a}} reduction in violence perpetration. This was unexpected as the limited research on problematic gambling and family violence amongst Asian people indicates the existence of a positive (i.e. increased violence) relationship (Bhuyan et al. 2005; Keen et al. 2015; Tse et al. 2004). A possible explanation for our result could be cultural norms preventing open discussion of issues that could be considered shameful to the family (the need to ‘save face’ or to minimise/hide problems) when answering questions on perpetrating family violence, particularly if the family included children; this may have led to conservative disclosure of violent behaviour in our study (Au 1998; Ho 1990; Tse et al. 2004).

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} basic {{theoretical}} model of risk adjustment (Glazer/McGuire 2000) {{with a special}} focus on a coherent presentation of the main results. With adverse selection a regulator pursuing efficiency and solidarity objectives will need a risk adjustment scheme acting on a signal to accomplish both aims. With an imperfect signal this result will not hold. The regulator can react by trying to find more informative signals or by changing the calculation of the risk adjustment scheme (optimal risk adjustment). The model is then extended to derive results on the associated incentives regarding economic efficiency, manipulation of signals and innovation. The incentives will hold with perfect signals but may be violated in the imperfect signal setting. Optimal risk adjustment will most likely {{have a negative effect}} on these incentives. The results are contrasted with the empirical literature on the risk adjustment procedure in Germany which is centred on risk selection, the choice of risk <b>adjustors</b> and incentive effects.

40|$|Health {{insurance}} and provider payment reforms {{all over the}} world beg a key empirical question: what are the potential impacts of patient cost-sharing on health care utilization, cost and outcomes? The unique health insurance system and rich electronic medical record (EMR) data in China provides us a unique opportunity to study this topic. Four years (2010 to 2014) of EMR data from one medical center in China were utilized, including 10, 858 adult patients with liver diseases. We measured patient cost-sharing using actual reimbursement ratio (RR) which is allowed us to better capture financial incentive than using type of health insurance. A rigorous risk adjustment method was employed with both comorbidities and disease severity measures acting as risk <b>adjustors.</b> Associations between RR and health use, costs and outcome were analyzed by multivariate analyses. After risk adjustment, patients with more generous health insurance coverage (higher RR) were found to have longer hospital stay, higher total cost, higher medication cost, and higher ratio of medication to total cost, as well as higher number and likelihood that specific procedures were performed. Our study implied that patient cost-sharing affects health care services use and cost. This reflects how patients and physicians respond to financial incentives in the current healthcare system in China, and the responses could be a joint effect of both demand and supply side moral hazard.

Secondly, two fundamentally different characters, both present in populations of wild house mice and under genetic control, ave described: on the one hand, active copers are characterized by aggressive behaviour; on the other hand, passive copers are reluctant to attack. The active, aggressive animals (manipulators) are well adapted to an invariant environment like their own territory, whereas the passive, non-aggressive copers (<b>adjustors)</b> are well adapted to a changing environment, eg when roaming.
