25|$|Atherogenesis is the {{developmental}} process of atheromatous plaques. It {{is characterized by}} a remodeling of arteries leading to subendothelial accumulation of fatty substances called plaques. The buildup of an <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaque</b> is a slow process, developed {{over a period of several}} years through a complex series of cellular events occurring within the arterial wall and in response to a variety of local vascular circulating factors. One recent hypothesis suggests that, for unknown reasons, leukocytes, such as monocytes or basophils, begin to attack the endothelium of the artery lumen in cardiac muscle. The ensuing inflammation leads to formation of atheromatous plaques in the arterial tunica intima, a region of the vessel wall located between the endothelium and the tunica media. The bulk of these lesions is made of excess fat, collagen, and elastin. At first, as the plaques grow, only wall thickening occurs without any narrowing. Stenosis is a late event, which may never occur and is often the result of repeated plaque rupture and healing responses, not just the atherosclerotic process by itself.|$|E
25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in angina pectoris are relief of symptoms, slowing {{progression of the}} disease, and reduction of future events, especially heart attacks and death. Beta blockers (e.g., carvedilol, propranolol, atenolol) have {{a large body of}} evidence in morbidity and mortality benefits (fewer symptoms, less disability and longer life) and short-acting nitroglycerin medications have been used since 1879 for symptomatic relief of angina. Calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine (Adalat) and amlodipine), isosorbide mononitrate and nicorandil are vasodilators commonly used in chronic stable angina. A new therapeutic class, called If inhibitor, has recently been made available: Ivabradine provides pure heart rate reduction leading to major anti-ischemic and antianginal efficacy. ACE inhibitors are also vasodilators with both symptomatic and prognostic benefit. Statins are the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers, which probably also stabilize existing <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaque.</b> Low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of heart attack in patients with chronic stable angina, and was part of standard treatment. However, in patients without established cardiovascular disease, the increase in hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding offsets any benefits and it is no longer advised unless the risk of myocardial infarction is very high.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} {{terms are}} similar, yet distinct, in both spelling and meaning, {{and can be}} easily confused: arteriosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and atherosclerosis. [...] Arteriosclerosis is a general term describing any hardening (and loss of elasticity) of medium or large arteries (...) arteriolosclerosis is any hardening (and loss of elasticity) of arterioles (small arteries); atherosclerosis is a hardening of an artery specifically due to an <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaque.</b> The term atherogenic is used for substances or processes that cause atherosclerosis.|$|E
40|$|Atherothrombosis is a {{systemic}} {{disease of the}} arterial wall that affects the carotid, coronary, and peripheral vascular beds, and the aorta. This condition is associated with complications such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and peripheral vascular disease, which usually result from unstable <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaques.</b> The study of <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaques</b> can provide useful information about the natural history and progression of the disease, and aid {{in the selection of}} appropriate treatment.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Atherosclerotic plaque {{instability}} may be {{a contributing}} factor to plaque complications, such as rupture, thrombosis, and embolization. Of {{the two types of}} <b>plaques,</b> <b>atheromatous</b> and fibrous, the atheromatous type has been reported to be vulnerable and unstable. This instability may be related to changes in the cell cycle and extracellular matrix degradation. Apoptosis may weaken the plaque structurally. In addition, alteration of the cellular component may lead to imbalances in associated proteolytic activity. Our study was designed to compare the two types of plaques in terms of apoptosis, apoptosis-inducing factors, namely Fas/CD 95 /APO- 1 and CPP- 32 /YAMA/caspase- 3, and proteolytic activity. Methods: Carotid artery plaques were obtained from patients undergoing endarterectomy and were classified as either atheromatous or fibrous on the basis of established criteria. Histologic study included hematoxylin and eosin staining, Verhoeff's van Gieson elastin staining, and trichrome staining. Detection of apoptosis was performed with the TUNEL assay. Immunohistochemical studies were performed to localize the expression of CPP- 32 /YAMA and Fas/CD 95. Gelatin gel zymography was used to compare proteolytic activity levels in the two types of plaque. Results: Apoptosis was significantly higher (P <. 001) in <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaques</b> (4. 90 % ± 1. 27 % [SEM]) as compared with fibrous plaques (0. 86 % ± 0. 46 % [SEM]). Zymography demonstrated elevated levels of proteinases in <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaques.</b> Immunohistochemistry revealed significant increases in the expression of Fas/CD 95 (P <. 04) and CPP- 32 /YAMA (P <. 001) in <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaques</b> as compared with that in fibrous plaques. Conclusions: This is the first study comparing molecular factors that render <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaques</b> more susceptible to rupture than fibrous plaques. The higher number of apoptotic cells seen in <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaques</b> as compared with fibrous plaques could contribute to their greater instability. Immunoreactivity to cytoplasmic death domain, Fas/CD 95 and CPP- 32 /YAMA, a prominent mediator of apoptosis, was consistent with the numbers of apoptotic cells detected. The increased levels of proteolytic activity in <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaques</b> may make these plaques more prone to rupture. These data identifying some of the molecular events and biochemical pathways associated with plaque vulnerability may help in the development of new strategies to prevent plaque rupture.

2500|$|Calcification forms among {{vascular}} {{smooth muscle}} {{cells of the}} surrounding muscular layer, specifically in the muscle cells adjacent to atheromas and {{on the surface of}} atheroma plaques and tissue. In time, as cells die, this leads to extracellular calcium deposits between the muscular wall and outer portion of the atheromatous plaques. With the <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaque</b> interfering with the regulation of the calcium deposition, it accumulates and crystallizes. [...] A similar form of an intramural calcification, presenting the picture of an early phase of arteriosclerosis, appears to be induced by a number of drugs that have an antiproliferative mechanism of action (Rainer Liedtke 2008).|$|E
2500|$|The first {{coronary}} artery bypass surgery was performed in the United States on May 2, 1960, at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine-Bronx Municipal Hospital Center by {{a team led by}} Robert H. Goetz and the thoracic surgeon, Michael Rohman with the assistance of Jordan Haller and Ronald Dee. In this technique the vessels are held together with circumferential ligatures over an inserted metal ring. The internal mammary artery was used as the donor vessel and was anastomosed to the right {{coronary artery}}. The actual anastomosis with the Rosenbach ring took fifteen seconds and did not require cardiopulmonary bypass. The disadvantage of using the internal mammary artery was that, at autopsy nine months later, the anastomosis was open, but an <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaque</b> had occluded the origin of the internal mammary that was used for the bypass.|$|E

This simple maneuver should be used when patients with transient ischemic attacks (cerebral or ocular) are examined with or without atheromatous disease of the carotid artery. Previously unseen or suspected plaques may be brought into view. Plaques already visible may appear larger or vary greatly in both color and texture giving indication of their composition.

40|$|Calcification is {{a common}} {{complication}} in atherosclerosis. As osteopontin (OPN) and osteonectin (ON) are not only involved in the physiological but also the pathological calcification of tissues, we examined the expression of OPN and ON messenger (m) RNAs in normal and atherosclerotic human aortas. By Northern blotting, the OPN mRNA expression {{was related to the}} severity of the atherosclerosis. However, ON mRNA expression decreased with the development of atherosclerosis. By a combination of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry of serial sections, the macrophages surrounding the <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaques</b> were identified as the OPN mRNA-expressing cells. The ON mRNA-expressing cells in aortas of a newborn baby and a 3 -year-old boy were medial smooth muscle cells, but in aortas of adults, smooth muscle cells that had invaded the intima were found to express ON mRNA. As OPN mRNA-expressing macrophages surrounded the <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaques,</b> and as the level of OPN mRNA expression increased as atherosclerosis advanced, it is possible that OPN plays a role in the calcification of <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaques...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aim: Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{is associated}} with accelerated carotid artery atherosclerosis and increased risk of stroke. This {{study was conducted with}} the objective of determining the prevalence of calcified atherosclerotic plaques on panoramic radiographs of patients with Type II diabetes mellitus. Materials and Methods: Panoramic radiographs of 100 patients (age range 50 - 84 years) with known history of type II diabetes mellitus, visiting the outpatient department were evaluated for the presence of calcified atherosclerotic plaques. Age- and sex-matched controls were evaluated in the same manner. Statistical comparison of prevalence rates was done. Results: The radiographs of diabetics (mean age: 64. 45 years) revealed that 26 % had <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaques,</b> whereas those of controls (mean age: 65. 36 years) revealed that 6 % had <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaques.</b> A statistically significant difference (P = 0. 01410) was obtained using Yates′ Chi-square test. Conclusion: People with diabetes mellitus had a greater prevalence of calcified atherosclerotic plaques on panoramic radiographs than non-diabetics. Panoramic radiographs of diabetic patients should be screened for the presence of carotid artery <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaques</b> for timely medical referral of asymptomatic patients and avoiding any further serious consequences like cerebrovascular accidents...|$|R
50|$|Both M1 and M2 macrophages {{play a role}} in {{promotion}} of atherosclerosis. M1 macrophages promote atherosclerosis by inflammation. M2 macrophages can remove cholesterol from blood vessels, but when the cholesterol is oxidized, the M2 macrophages become apoptotic foam cells contributing to the <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaque</b> of atherosclerosis.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, IVUS examinations, as {{they were}} done more frequently, served to reveal and confirm the autopsy {{research}} findings of the late 1980s, showing that <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaque</b> tends to cause expansion of the internal elastic lamina, causing the degree of plaque burden to be greatly underestimated by angiography.

40|$|Calcification {{is common}} in <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaques</b> and may con-tribute to plaque rupture and {{subsequent}} thrombosis. However, {{little is known about}} the mechanisms which regulate the calcifi-cation process. Using in situ hybridization and immunohisto-chemistry we show that two bone-associated proteins, osteo-pontin (OP) and matrix Gla protein (MGP), are highly ex-pressed in human <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaques.</b> High levels of OP mRNA and protein were found in association with necrotic lipid cores and areas of calcification.

Highest levels of this matrix-associated protein were found in lipid-rich areas of the plaque. The pattern of expression of these two genes contrasted markedly with that of calponin and SM 22 a, genes expressed predominantly by differentiated smooth muscle cells and whose expression was generally con-fined to the media of the vessel.

In five patients undergoing surgical vascular procedures, specimens containing <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaques</b> were removed and immediately incubated in autologous oxygenated blood at 37 °C with hematoporphyrin derivative at a clinically relevant concentration for 2 hours. On exposure to ultraviolet light, porphyrin fluorescence was noted throughout each plaque, whereas adjacent plaque-free tissue showed no fluorescence. To compare in vitro with in vivo hematoporphyrin derivative uptake by plaques, the fluorescence of three types of arterial lesions (induced by a high cholesterol diet, catheters or balloon injury) was studied in 16 New Zealand White rabbits. Each lesion fluoresced selectively with the same intensity whether hematoporphyrin derivative exposure was performed in vitro or in vivo. Fluorescence microscopy did not show a difference in the pattern of hematoporphyrin derivative fluorescence between in vitro and in vivo specimens. The results suggest that human <b>atheromatous</b> <b>plaques</b> should take up hematoporphyrin derivative in vivo and are, therefore, potentially suitable for photochemical treatment as a new therapeutic approach to atherosclerosis...|$|R

At the throat it forks into the internal and external carotid arteries. The internal carotid artery supplies the brain, and the external carotid artery supplies the face.
