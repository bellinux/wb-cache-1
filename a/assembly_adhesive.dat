2500|$|For early {{production}} aircraft, {{the structural}} <b>assembly</b> <b>adhesive</b> was Casein-based. At a later stage, this {{was replaced by}} [...] "Aerolite", a synthetic urea-formaldehyde type, which was more durable. To provide for the edge joints for the fuselage halves, zones near the outer edges of the shells had their balsa sandwich cores replaced by much stronger inner laminations of birch plywood. For the bonding together of the two halves ("boxing up"), a longitudinal cut was machined into these edges. The profile of this cut {{was a form of}} V-groove. Part of the edge bonding process also included adding further longitudinal plywood lap-strips {{on the outside of the}} shells. The half-bulkheads of each shell were bonded to their corresponding pair in a similar way.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{one-step}} co-curing process of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) joined with a steel plate to form a hybrid structure. In this process CFRP laminate and bond to the metal are realized simultaneously by resin infusion, such that the same resin serves for both infusion and adhesion. For comparison, the commonly applied two-step process of adhesive bonding is studied. In this case, the CFRP laminate is fabricated in a first stage through resin infusion of Non Crimp Fabric (NCF) and joined to the steel plate in a further step through adhesive bonding. For this purpose, the commercially available epoxy-based Betamate 1620 is applied. CFRP laminates were fabricated using two different resin systems, namely the epoxy (EP) -based RTM 6 and a newly developed fast curing polyurethane (PU) resin. Results show comparable mechanical performance of the PU and EP based CFRP laminates. The strength of the bond of the co-cured samples {{was in the same}} order as the samples adhesively bonded with the PU resin and the structural adhesive.

40|$|The <b>assembly</b> of <b>adhesive</b> pili in Gram-negative {{bacteria}} is modulated by specialized periplasmic chaperone systems. PapD is {{the prototype}} {{member of the}} superfamily of periplasmic pilus chaperones. Previously, the alignment of chaperone sequences superimposed on the three dimensional structure of PapD revealed the presence of invariant, conserved and variable amino acids. Representative residues that protruded into the PapD cleft were targeted for site directed mutagenesis to investigate the pilus protein binding site of the chaperone. The ability of PapD to bind to fiber-forming pilus subunit proteins to prevent their participation in misassembly interactions depended on the invariant, solvent-exposed arginine- 8 (R 8) cleft residue. This residue was also essential for the interaction between PapD and a minor pilus adaptor protein. A mutation in the conserved methionine- 172 (M 172) cleft residue abolished PapD function when this mutant protein was expressed below a critical threshold level. In contrast, radical changes in the variable residue glutamic acid- 167 (E 167) {{had little or no}} effect on PapD function.

40|$|AbstractPeriplasmic chaperones {{direct the}} <b>assembly</b> of <b>adhesive,</b> multi-subunit pilus fibers that play {{critical}} roles in bacterial pathogenesis. Pilus assembly occurs via a donor strand exchange mechanism {{in which the}} N-terminal extension of one subunit replaces the chaperone G 1 strand that transiently occupies a groove in the neighboring subunit. Here, we show that the chaperone primes the subunit for assembly by holding the groove in an open, activated conformation. During donor strand exchange, the subunit undergoes a topological transition that triggers {{the closure of the}} groove and seals the N-terminal extension in place. It is this topological transition, made possible only by the priming action of the chaperone that drives subunit assembly into the fiber...|$|R

40|$|P pili {{are highly}} ordered {{composite}} structures consisting of thin fibrillar tips joined end-to-end to rigid helical rods. The production of these virulence-associated structures requires a periplasmic chaperone (PapD) and an outer membrane protein (PapC) {{that is the}} prototype member of a newly recognized class of proteins that we have named "molecular ushers. " Two in vitro assays showed that the preassembly complexes that PapD forms with the three most distal tip fibrillar proteins (PapG, PapF, and PapE) bound to PapC. The relative affinity of each complex for PapC was found to correlate with the final position of the subunit type in the tip fibrillum.

Collagen and/or von Willebrand Factor (vWF) in 5 % glycerol was contact printed onto glass slides to create defined microspots (176 -μm diameter) of adsorbed protein without sample dehydration.

To mimic the subendothelial matrix, vWF was microarrayed over sonicated type I collagen microspots. For whole blood perfusion (500 s− 1, 10 min) over collagen, vWF, and collagen/vWF microspots, the amount of platelet deposition on the collagen/vWF spots was ∼ 2 times greater in comparison to the collagen spots and ∼ 18 times greater in comparison to the vWF spots.

40|$|Transmembrane cadherins are calcium-dependent {{intercellular}} adhesion molecules. Recently, {{they have}} {{also been shown to}} be sites of actin <b>assembly</b> during <b>adhesive</b> contact formation. However, the roles of actin assembly on transmembrane cadherins during development are not fully understood. We show here, using the developing ectoderm of the Xenopus embryo as a model, that F-actin assembly is a primary function of both N-cadherin in the neural ectoderm and E-cadherin in the non-neural (epidermal) ectoderm, and that each cadherin is essential for the characteristic morphogenetic movements of these two tissues. However, depletion of N-cadherin and E-cadherin did not cause dissociation in these tissues at the neurula stage, probably owing to the expression of C-cadherin in each tissue. Depletion of each of these cadherins is not rescued by the other, nor by the expression of C-cadherin, which is expressed in both tissues. One possible {{reason for this is that}} each cadherin is expressed in a different domain of the cell membrane. These data indicate the combinatorial nature of cadherin function, the fact that N- and E-cadherin play primary roles in F-actin assembly in addition to roles in cell adhesion, and that this function is specific to individual cadherins. They also show how cell adhesion and motility can be combined in morphogenetic tissue movements that generate the form and shape of the embryonic organs...|$|R
