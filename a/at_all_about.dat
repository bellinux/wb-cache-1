5|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} problem Biden faced {{was the fact that}} voters did not know about him and his candidacy. An April 2–5 poll {{conducted}} by Gallup found that 38% of the public had never heard of Joe Biden and 17% had no opinion <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> him. In contrast, 0% of the public had never heard of Hillary Clinton and only 3% had no opinion according to a June 1–3 poll by Gallup.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} remains, as Jona Lendering points out, {{that most of}} the things we know about Aspasia are based on mere hypothesis. Thucydides does not mention her; our only sources are the untrustworthy {{representations}} and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy, who did not care <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Aspasia as a historical character. Therefore, in the figure of Aspasia, we get a range of contradictory portrayals; she is either a good wife like Theano or some combination of courtesan and prostitute like Thargelia. This is the reason modern scholars express their scepticism about the historicity of Aspasia's life.|$|E

It's really just about it being toxic, and they're on this drug trip and that definitely plays a part, but I think it's also about being triumphant over those weaknesses, and she leaves him. It's not trying to glorify that type of relationship. The bad parts of it, that's what you don't want. In the end, her leaving, it represents her getting that out of her life. The drugs and the addiction and the toxic—that's what brings her downfall and brings a lot of harm.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{began at}} about 9am on 14 October 1066 and lasted all day, but while a broad outline is known, the exact events are {{obscured}} by contradictory accounts in the sources. Although {{the numbers on}} each side were probably about equal, William had both cavalry and infantry, including many archers, while Harold had only foot soldiers and few archers. The English soldiers formed up as a shield wall along the ridge, and were at first so effective that William's army was thrown back with heavy casualties. Some of William's Breton troops panicked and fled, {{and some of the}} English troops appear to have pursued the fleeing Bretons. Norman cavalry then attacked and killed the pursuing troops. While the Bretons were fleeing, rumours swept the Norman forces that the duke had been killed, but William rallied his troops. Twice more the Normans made feigned withdrawals, tempting the English into pursuit, and allowing the Norman cavalry to attack them repeatedly. The available sources are more confused about events in the afternoon, but it appears that the decisive event was the death of Harold, about which differing stories are told. William of Jumieges claimed that Harold was killed by the duke. The Bayeux Tapestry has been claimed to show Harold's death by an arrow to the eye, but this may be a later reworking of the tapestry to conform to 12th-century stories that Harold had died from an arrow wound to the head. Other sources stated that no one knew how Harold died because the press of battle was so tight around the king that the soldiers could not see who struck the fatal blow. William of Poitiers gives no details <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Harold's death.|$|E

It is also important to note that the hadith appeared in the mushaf of Ubay because it was for his own personal use, in other words, his private notebook, where he did not always distinguish between Quranic material and hadith, since it was not meant for general use and he himself knew well what to make of his own notes. The same is true of the other copies of the Quran, which some of the Companions had for their own personal use.|$|E
25|$|Buffy's old boyfriend from Hemery High in LA, Pike, makes a {{surprise}} appearance in Sunnydale, {{much to the}} everyone's shock, particularly Buffy's. Only Pike hasn't come {{to catch up with}} Buffy; he's being pursued by a rock demon known as Grayhewn. Pike had originally killed the demon's mate after it had killed his friend and now the demon wants Pike dead in the most painful way possible. As soon as Pike makes his appearance though, Buffy struggles to deal with her old feelings for Pike as well as her love for Angel, creating nothing but confusion within herself. Meanwhile, Giles appears to be dating a new teacher named Miss Blaisdell. But since Giles has been seeing her, he seems to waver {{in and out of consciousness}} and doesn't appear to care <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Buffy or her struggles. Miss Blaisdell, as it turns out, is working for a man from Giles' past, a man from his very personal past, who wants nothing more than to painfully torture the Watcher and make him suffer.|$|E

25|$|In {{the morning}} of 22 July a most {{important}} meeting took place: the one between the King and Mussolini, who wanted to report about the outcome of Feltre. The content of the conversation is unknown, but according to Badoglio, {{it is possible that}} Mussolini calmed down the King's fears, promising him to disengage Italy from the war by September 15. These two months of delay {{can be explained by the}} fact that, on the one hand, Bastianini had begun contacts with the Allies which would need some time to proceed; on the other, Mussolini needed some time to justify himself and Italy before the world for his betrayal. Apparently the King agreed with him, as this would explain why the Duce was not worried <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the outcome of the Grand Council meeting. In fact, without the aid of the King, a coup d’etat was destined to fail. Anyway, at the end of the meeting the two men reached two quite different conclusions: while Mussolini was convinced that the King was always at his side, Victor Emmanuel was disappointed after telling him in vain that he should resign. The King was forced now to consider the putsch seriously, as he knew that Bastianini was trying to contact the Allies, while Farinacci, the fascist hardliner, was organizing a putsch to depose him and Mussolini and bring Italy under direct German control. The real decision was taken after knowing that the Grand Council had approved Grandi's OdG.|$|E

The song Janet sings—"Only You" [...] by Yazoo—was particularly challenging. Howlett sought help from the composer John Chambers, with whom she had previously worked, and with his help, learnt the song's rhythm and then placed the lyrics relative to it.

Against Division I FCS James Madison, Smith caught eight passes for 80yards, rushed twice for 22yards and a touchdown, and returned four kickoffs 127yards, including one 81-yard touchdown return.

[...] Smith agreed with the criticism, and acknowledged that in his second season as a wide receiver, he had room for improvement.

Against Wake Forest, Smith returned six kickoffs 194yards and caught a career-high ten passes for 70yards and a touchdown. For his performance, he was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Specialist of the Week.
