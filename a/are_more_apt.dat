25|$|It {{has been}} argued that the very term 'tragedy of the commons' is a misnomer per se, since 'the commons' {{originally}} referred to a resource owned by a community, and no individual outside the community had any access to the resource. However, the term is presently used when describing a problem where all individuals have equal and open access to a resource. Hence, 'tragedy of open access regimes' or simply 'the open access problem' <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>apt</b> terms.|$|E
25|$|On various Internet forums, some gamers have {{expressed}} disapproval of publishers having creative control since publishers <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>apt</b> to follow short-term market trends rather than invest in risky but potentially lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may {{know better than}} developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between recording artists and record labels in many ways. But unlike the music industry, which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s, the video game industry continues to grow. Also, personal computers have made the independent development of music almost effortless, while the gap between an independent game developer and {{the product of a}} fully financed one grows larger.|$|E
25|$|The migratory {{ability is}} ranked {{tertiary}} > secondary > aryl > primary. Allylic groups <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>apt</b> to migrate than primary alkyl groups but less so than secondary alkyl groups. Electron-withdrawing {{groups on the}} substituent decrease the rate of migration. There are two explanations for this trend in migration ability. One {{explanation relies on the}} buildup of positive charge in the transition state for breakdown of the Criegee intermediate (illustrated by the carbocation resonance structure of the Criegee intermediate). Keeping this structure in mind, it makes sense that the substituent that can maintain positive charge the best would be most likely to migrate. The higher the degree of substitution, the more stable a carbocation generally is. Therefore, the tertiary > secondary > primary trend is observed.|$|E

25|$|All low-lying {{areas and}} the areas between craters and basins in the Discovery {{quadrangle}} are covered by broadly level, plains-forming material, except for small areas covered by the hilly and lineated material and hummocky plains material described below. Tracts of plains materials {{range in size from}} a few kilometers across to intercrater areas several hundred kilometers in width. This material is probably not all of the same origin. Strom and others and Trask and Strom cited evidence that many large areas of plains are of volcanic origin. Smaller tracts <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>apt</b> to be impact melt, loose debris pooled in low spots by seismic shaking, or ejecta from secondary impacts. The origin of many individual tracts must necessarily remain uncertain without additional information.|$|E
25|$|Village rugs <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>apt</b> to have warps of wool {{rather than}} of cotton. Their designs are not as {{elaborate}} and ornate than the curvilinear patterns of city rugs. They {{are more likely to}} display abrash and conspicuous mistakes in detail. On simple vertical looms, the correct tension of the warps is difficult to maintain during the entire weaving process. So, village rugs tend to vary in width from end to end, have irregular sides, and may not lay entirely flat. In contrast to manufactory rugs, there is considerable variety in treating the selvedges and fringes. Village rugs are less likely to present depressed warps, as compared to manufactory rugs. They tend to make less use of flat woven kilim ends to finish off the ends of the rug, as compared to tribal rugs. The variation in treatment of fringes and ends, and the way the selvedges are treated, provide clues as to place of origin.|$|E
25|$|Pacific salmon are {{harvested}} {{throughout the world}} as a source of food in countries ranging from the United States to South Korea. Over the past century, Pacific salmon have been extensively fished through both recreational, artisan and commercial fishing. In fact, since the 1970s there has been a nearly threefold increase in catch of Pacific salmon. As this catch has increased, a selection of reduced body size has been observed. In Japanese Chum Salmon, for example, between 1970 and 1988 there has been a continuous decrease in body weight averaging between 11 and 32 percent. In part, this decline in body weight has been related to the size selective effect of fishing gear used in the harvesting of salmon populations. Salmon of larger body weight <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>apt</b> to be caught during fishing efforts, causing lower body weight to be a beneficial character trait for survival. Thus, Pacific salmon have become continuously smaller in body size. However, studies have also shown that for Pacific salmon a larger mean size at the time of reproduction increases the survival of offspring. The life history of salmon favors delayed reproduction because fecundity increased with body size. Consequently, the smaller body size of salmon results in a negative impact on population growth by decreasing the survivability of progeny, and thus decreasing the growth rate of populations. This reduction of productivity in Pacific salmon is, in part, seeded in the overfishing and has caused a reduction in population sizes throughout Pacific salmon species. Today, it seems that population numbers of Pacific salmon are on the rise, however the consequences from the overfishing in the 70s and 80s are still being reflected with the average body size of salmon being smaller than before the event of overfishing.|$|E

500|$|It is {{difficult}} to teach delayed gratification when children grow up expecting a large, instant reward for their years of schooling. Societal impacts and current media trends have {{had the effect of}} teaching people to expect instant gratification. The idea of waiting for a good job, earned through working from the bottom up, frequently upsets and frustrates emerging adults in today's society. This desire for immediate gratification is not only found in workplaces, but also in interpersonal relationships. Current studies show that 45% of marriages will end in divorce. Without the ability to delay gratification people <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>apt</b> to end relationships rather than work on them.

[...] Thiel applied this theory to his personal life and business ventures, stating: [...] "The big problem with competition is that it focuses us on the people around us, and while we get better at the things we're competing on, we lose sight of anything that's important, or transcendent, or truly meaningful in our world." ...|$|E
