5|$|On the train, they inject Rain and Kaplan {{with the}} anti-virus. However, the Licker is hiding {{on the train}} and attacks them, clawing Matt and killing Kaplan. In the ensuing battle, Alice subdues the Licker before Matt is {{attacked}} by a now-zombified Rain. He shoots Rain dead, causing her head to hit a trapdoor button, opening it <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> the Licker under the train which ultimately kills it for good. At the mansion, Matt's wound begins mutating. Before Alice can give him the anti-virus, the mansion doors burst open {{and a group of}} Umbrella scientists seizes them. They subdue Alice and take Matt away, revealing he is to be put into the Nemesis Program.|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} of the dispersion band in the settler of a pilot scale mixer-settler unit is analyzed. <b>Drop</b> to <b>drop</b> <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> to interface coalescence are studied by image analysis of digital video taken under different specific velocity. Dispersion band thickness, hold up <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> size distribution were determine along its length, <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> to <b>drop</b> <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> to interface coalescence kinetic were estimated. The analysis is focused in the differences of {{behavior of}} the dispersion band, when the settler is operating at a specific flow such that the dispersion band disappear {{before the end of}} the settler, dispersion band with a wedge profile, compared with the case when the dispersion band is in contact with the end of the settler, <b>and</b> <b>drops</b> are subject to compression with the wall (flooded settler). It was determined that drop size distribution in the dispersion band follows a log normal distribution, <b>and</b> the average <b>drop</b> sizes increase as a function of length and height in the dispersion band...|$|R
5|$|Power is {{supplied}} to the chip in 1.7 microsecond pulses {{as determined by}} the storage time of a control transistor. An oscillator clock operating at 200 kilohertz during calculations <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> to 15 kilohertz between each operation means shut off time ranges from 3.3 microseconds during calculations to over 65 microseconds between. The device relies on the capacitance of the chips to store information when there is no power, and 1.7 microseconds proved sufficient for the chip to carry out a single change of state of the electronics. Any calculation can be done in 1000 such changes. This had the effect of extending battery life to about 20 hours of continuous use with three small hearing aid batteries, equivalent to about four months of normal usage.|$|E
5|$|The Windows {{version of}} the game had a more mixed reception, with {{criticism}} aimed mostly at the technical issues present {{at the time of}} the game's release, ultimately leading to sales being suspended. On June 23, 2015, the launch day for Arkham Knight, thousands of users reported major technical flaws and performance problems with the Windows {{version of the}} game, with some saying it seemed like the optimization phase of the game's development was skipped. Steam users immediately wrote scathing reviews of the game's performance, including reports of frame rate being capped at 30 frames per second (which could be raised, though with potential side effects) <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> as low as 10 frames per second while gliding or using the Batmobile.|$|E
5|$|The crisis flared again {{two years}} later when the Canadian {{military}} called for overseas reinforcements. Ralston wanted King to impose conscription, but at Macdonald's urging, seemed willing to compromise by going along with the prime minister's plan for one last voluntary recruitment campaign. King however, suddenly dismissed Ralston during a cabinet meeting on November 1, 1944. Macdonald considered resigning, but said later he would have struck King if he had risen to leave. Instead {{he sat in his}} chair ripping sheets of notepaper into small shreds <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> them on the floor. Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald's decision not to resign probably saved the King government. King himself seemed to recognize that if Macdonald had left, Ilsley would have resigned too, possibly taking other ministers with him and causing the government's collapse.|$|E

5|$|The latter, at the {{southwest}} corner of Southwest Third Avenue and Washington Street, is eight stories high, was built entirely of Oregon materials, and cost $300,000 in 1892 dollars. The first three stories of the Romanesque structure are of rough-cut sandstone; the top five floors are of red brick and unglazed terracotta with floral designs. Decorative machicolations (openings of the sort used in earlier eras for pouring pitch <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> rocks on attackers) appear in the parapet {{at the top of the}} building. For eight years starting in 1893 Portland's government was headquartered in this structure, temporarily dubbed the Council Building. The exterior was renovated in 1987, and the interior opened to the nearby Hamilton Building in the 1990s. The Dekum Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 and is part of the Skidmore/Old Town Historic District.|$|E
5|$|The league {{was unusually}} competitive; {{a mistake in}} early April caused Benfica to lose much of their lead. Qualifying for the Portuguese Cup final did not help them to gather momentum. In early May, Benfica {{suffered}} a major blow, losing away to Penafiel <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> to second. A crucial win against Sporting brought back thei title hope, and a week later Benfica won their first league title in ten seasons. The season ended with a loss against Vitória de Setúbal in the Taça de Portugal Final, preventing Benfica from winning their first double since 1987.|$|E
5|$|The race {{began with}} Kubica in pole {{position}} alongside Massa; Lewis Hamilton, the eventual Drivers' Champion, started from third, alongside Räikkönen. Kubica {{was passed by}} Massa into the first corner, and then by Räikkönen on the third lap. The Ferraris dominated {{at the front of}} the race, leading to their 1–2 finish. Hamilton had a slow start after almost stalling on the grid, and dropped back to ninth. The McLaren driver ran into the back of Fernando Alonso's Renault a lap later, breaking off the McLaren's front wing <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> Hamilton to the back of the field.|$|E

5|$|Webber {{was able}} to climb from 16th on the grid to take 12th behind Glock, and passed the Toyota on the second lap. Kubica, further up the field, {{improved}} on his grid position, moving from 11th to take eighth behind Vettel. However, Hamilton was the quickest on track, as he set new fastest laps on laps three, six and eight, to extend his lead over Räikkönen to more than four seconds. This trend continued until lap10 when Räikkönen fought back and closed the gap. However, Hamilton extended his lead when he set the fastest lap of the race, a 1:36.325 on lap13. In the other McLaren, Kovalainen was struggling, running two seconds a lap slower than Hamilton, <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> back from Alonso to Heidfeld.|$|E

Ingham was the only ever-present player for York, appearing in all 51 matches. Chambers was top scorer with 10 goals in the league, being the only player to reach double figures, and was followed by Walker with nine goals.|$|E
5|$|At 20:45, with Jason {{far behind}} in the darkness, Mars hauled up and Hood {{attempted}} to manoeuvre into an effective position from which to attack the waiting Hercule. The vagaries of the current in the Raz de Sein passage prevented Hood from handling his ship effectively however and instead he resolved on bringing Mars directly alongside and fighting broadside to broadside. At 21:15 Mars was in range and L'Héritier opened fire, Hood replying immediately. For ten minutes, the masts and rigging of Mars came under fire, with damage to the bowsprit and foremast, as Hood continued to attempt to hold his firing position against the current before pulling slightly ahead of Hercule at 21:25 <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> anchor. The port bow anchor became entangled with the starboard anchor on Hercule and the British ship was swung violently into the French ship, {{the force of the}} collision unhinging four of the gunports on Mars.|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of drops at the surface of turbulent liquids, e. g., turbulent primary breakup, was studied experimen-tally.

50|$|Drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> is {{considered}} an important program construction approach in many end-user development systems. In contrast to more traditional, text-based programming languages, many end-user programming languages are based on visual components such as tiles or icons that are manipulated by end users through drag-and-drop interfaces. Drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> is also featured in many shader editing programs for graphics tools, such as Blender. Drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> also features in some video game engines, including Unreal Engine, GameMaker: Studio, Construct 2 and, with expansion, Unity (game engine).|$|R

5|$|Delay issues aside, the {{development}} team encountered further {{challenges in the}} creation of the game. Implementing the top-down perspective became a particular issue and resulted in a lot of trial and error. With a true top-down view, players would be unable to see characters' faces and bodies. To circumvent this issue, objects in the world were tilted at an angle so that they were more visible in the top-down view. Mouri requested that the game run at sixty frames per second instead of thirty to stabilise the stereoscopic 3D and smoothen movement animations. While doubling the frame rate increased the processing load, it allowed the developers to implement a feature where players could select items by dragging <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> them from their inventory using the Nintendo 3DS's touchscreen and stylus; at thirty frames per second this feature felt too sluggish for the stylus's movement.|$|E
5|$|Due to rain {{shortly before}} the start of the race, it {{commenced}} behind the safety car, with every car equipped with full wet tyres. The safety car came back into the pitlane at the end of lap five and racing began properly. While the top four drivers stayed out, several behind chose to make a pitstop for intermediate tyres. Just one lap later, Pascal Wehrlein became the first casualty of the still damp track, sliding off the track and getting stuck in the gravel, leading to a brief virtual safety car period. During this time, both Hamilton and Rosberg changed tyres. The biggest winner of the first few laps was Sergio Pérez, who had worked up his way from tenth on the grid to fourth, ahead of Ricciardo. Meanwhile, at the front, Hamilton had established a five-second advantage over Rosberg, who soon came under attack by Verstappen, who was running well on the intermediate tyres. Bottas came into a spin on lap 11, losing positions <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> back to 13th place. On lap 16, Sebastian Vettel was the first driver to make the switch to slick tyres, while Verstappen moved ahead of Rosberg into second position.|$|E
