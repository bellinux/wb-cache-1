5|$|A plain {{soldier and}} {{business}} man. I am no politician, nor have I {{any desire to}} be one. In {{the course of my}} commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. What I have seen in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> desire of mine is heartily share by {{the vast majority of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|I {{think that}} the band went on... maybe not a tangent, {{but we had a}} goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And I think we showed too much. I think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E
25|$|Wu Zhipu {{claims he}} can move 30 billion cubic metres; I think 30,000 people will die. Zeng Xisheng {{has said that}} he will move 20 billion cubic metres, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> 20,000 people will die. Weiqing only {{promises}} 600 million cubic metres, maybe nobody will die.|$|E
50|$|Problem solution: My girlfriend {{wants to}} make up with me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> better {{for both of us}} (thinking about the other's {{intended}} actions).|$|R
500|$|Boyle {{was offered}} a knighthood in late 2012, but turned it down, saying [...] "I'm very {{proud to be an}} equal citizen <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> what the Opening Ceremony was {{actually}} about." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "But we're always {{concerned}} {{with the quality of}} the tune; just writing crazy music isn't enough, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> what makes us different from other bands who go really technical. We're definitely writing songs." ...|$|R
25|$|I {{watched him}} as a student of politics, rather than someone {{involved}} in politics, and he always struck me as someone who was a statesman {{as well as a}} politician, someone who was in politics for all the right reasons, and someone who made a huge contribution to the peace process bringing reconciliation for all that had happened in the past. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> today of all days with the state visit and the warm relationship between Britain and Ireland that he can see that some of his work being completed.|$|E
25|$|Whatever is good, bad or {{indifferent}} about Streets of Fire, {{it had a}} {{huge impact}} on other filmmakers. The two movies that came out in the years after that are completely saturated in the iconography of Streets of Fire are RoboCop and Se7en. Se7en’s taking place in another world. It’s not New York. It’s not Chicago. A world where it’s raining all the time. Always dark. Always night, just about. Those are two very successful movies that figured out how to do the stylization with the appropriate amount of gore that they hooked the audience. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if we’d done more gore, our chances of hooking the audience would be greater.|$|E
25|$|Lake {{expressed}} interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:The studio feels that way about it too. They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... I want this to be the turning point <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E

3000|$|... ‘From {{that very}} first session when we watched <b>that</b> video <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> {{the one thing}} I’ve picked up most from this club is {{understanding}} how you doctor what you watch unintentionally’ (Teacher N) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was fine}} of him," [...] said Miss Tyrell, eagerly. [...] "He {{never told me}} {{anything}} about it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> rather fine too. I like brave men. Have you ever been overboard after anybody?" ...|$|R
25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> all of the perks attached to this journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{will tell}} you now, first off, I'm Christian, and my career is {{evidence}} of God in my life, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> most people are already thinking that Gaga and the blasphemy and they're premeditating the approach and I think they'll be very shocked {{to find out how}} huge and really groundbreaking the message is and how freeing the message is for all the right reasons. And it's really going to shock the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{a three-year}} {{absence from the}} big screen, Gosling starred in five movies in 2010 and 2011. [...] "I’ve never had more energy,” Gosling has said. “I’m more excited to make films than I used to be. I used to kind of dread it. It was so {{emotional}} and taxing. But I’ve {{found a way to}} have fun while doing it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> translates into the films.” He has also spoken of feeling depressed when not working.|$|E
5000|$|... “When I was invited, they’re like ‘It’s not a show, it’s not a presentation,’—she said ‘It’s an experience!’” shared Coco Rocha. “Everyone is {{definitely}} amused {{and the girls}} are just smiling <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> what fashion should be.” ...|$|R
500|$|... "My {{mother was}} a teacher, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> one reason that, amidst my deal-making skills, I {{have a very strong}} {{pedagogical}} bent", he says. [...] "I really enjoy teaching, and believe {{it is one of the}} most important professions in our society." ...|$|R
30|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is {{important}} to know, like for example diabetes or high blood pressure. You need to know {{what can be done to}} prevent it or delay it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> important. That’s important that we learn what’s involved with a disease.|$|R
500|$|With {{the opening}} of trade between England and Japan, Japanese imports, art and styles became fashionable in London, making the time ripe for an opera set in Japan. Gilbert said, [...] "I cannot {{give you a good}} reason for our... piece being laid in Japan. It... afforded scope for picturesque treatment, scenery and costume, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the idea of a chief magistrate, who is... judge and actual executioner in one, and yet would not hurt a worm, may perhaps please the public." ...|$|E
500|$|I got a call, {{they wanted}} me {{to be a part of}} that record. [...] It was {{actually}} the last day before Kanye had to turn the record in, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> pressure just made it that much more special to me. So I just sat there, approached the record openly and as straightforward as I could. When I laid the verse, 30 minutes later, I was extremely happy. I sent it to him, and he was too. I think it was one of the dopest verses I did this year." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story for}} Halo 2 {{grew out of}} all the {{elements}} that were not seen in Halo: Combat Evolved. Jason Jones organized his core ideas for the sequel's story and approached Staten for input. According to Staten, among the elements that did not make it to the finished game was a [...] "horrible scene of betrayal" [...] where Miranda Keyes straps a bomb to the Master Chief's back and throws him into a hole; [...] "Jason was going through a rather difficult breakup at the time <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{had something to do with}} it," [...] he said.|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> Dahlia {{makes such}} a great {{character}} because she's very action-oriented, she's very physical and she's very visual... She never hesitates to take direct action, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> a really good characteristic {{of someone who is}} the protagonistof a video game. Charlaine Harris ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{also spoke}} of the inspirations for Pastor Mike: [...] "There were people when <b>I</b> was young <b>and</b> in my teens {{who were trying to}} help kids, and they did help. There are people who without whom I don't know where I'd be today. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> what Pastor Mike is {{ultimately}} trying to do. He's trying to save lives and be compassionate, in a system that doesn't really allow it. I have a friend who's a schoolteacher who was telling me how you're not allowed to hug the students anymore, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> just unbelievable. <b>I</b> understand it, I get it, but I had teachers when I was growing up who were so kind and supportive. It was wonderful." ...|$|R
5000|$|In his 2015 book, The Courage to Act, Bernanke {{revealed}} {{that he was no}} longer a Republican, having [...] "lost patience with Republicans' susceptibility to the know-nothing-ism of the far right. ... I view myself now as a moderate independent, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> where I'll stay." ...|$|R
500|$|Island Records was keen on Drake {{promoting}} Bryter Layter through press interviews, radio {{sessions and}} live appearances. Drake, who {{by this time}} was smoking what Kirby has described as [...] "unbelievable amounts" [...] of cannabis and exhibiting [...] "the first signs of psychosis", refused. Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs. His sister recalled: [...] "This was a very bad time. He {{once said to me}} that everything started to go wrong from [...] time on, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was when things started to go wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|Jenna Fischer {{found her}} character's {{break-up}} scene with Roy [...] "really dark," [...] {{as she is}} friends with David Denman outside of the show. She explained, [...] "To see him turn like that, {{for me it was}} even more shocking because I know him as a big teddy bear. He played it so well <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> cliffhanger of 'I’m gonna kill Jim Halpert' {{is one of the best}} last lines of our episodes ever." [...] "Cocktails" [...] included recurring guest star Michael Patrick McGill as Kenny Anderson, who called working on The Office [...] "a blast." [...] Other guest stars included Dan Cole as Dan Gore, Owen Daniels as the Wallaces' son, and Jean Villepique as Rachel Wallace.|$|E
500|$|Paul Taylor of the Financial Times {{found the}} ZX81 to be [...] "a {{powerful}} and flexible little computer ideally suited as a fun {{introduction to the}} mysteries of home computing" [...] but cautioned readers about its limitations. It lacked ready-made software, the keyboard {{was not easy to}} use, it did not have sufficiently advanced graphics to be able to replicate arcade-style games and its built-in memory was inadequate. Even so, he suggested, [...] "the ZX81 is a unique British product, part toy, part puzzle, part learning tool <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> provided one accepts its limitations and recognises that any computer will only do what it is told to do, it is good value as an introduction to the hobby of home computing." ...|$|E
5000|$|Supporting Democracy: [...] "In the U.S., the {{broadcast}} media in particular does {{a poor job}} of making crucial issues clear and relevant for Americans to understand. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> a real threat to a functioning democracy" [...] (qtd. in The Globe and Mail, 22 August 2011) ...|$|R
5000|$|... “They {{definitely}} get you noticed,” declared Cat Deeley. “I {{love her}} appreciation of color. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it’s beautiful <b>and</b> for me they fit my body; they {{look good on}} me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> what it’s all about. It’s about knowing your own body and knowing what suits you.” ...|$|R
5000|$|I have a {{long history}} of using {{whatever}} is around...And it can be confused with being sort of the champion recycling guy <b>and</b> Im not. <b>I</b> just use whats around. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> actually a better idea of sustainability in the end. Michael Salter, an interview to The Register-Guard ...|$|R
500|$|Conservative Senator Hugh Segal {{believes}} that Macdonald's true monument is Canada itself: [...] "Without Macdonald we'd be {{a country that}} begins somewhere at the Manitoba-Ontario border that probably goes throughout the east. Newfoundland would be like Alaska <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would also go for Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and B.C. We'd be buying our oil from the United States. It would diminish our {{quality of life and}} range of careers, and our role in the world would have been substantially reduced." [...] Macdonald's biographers note his contribution to establishing Canada as a nation. Swainson suggests that Macdonald's desire for a free and tolerant Canada became part of its national outlook: [...] "He not only helped to create Canada, but contributed immeasurably to its character." [...] Gwyn said of Macdonald, ...|$|E
500|$|Eventually, {{the band}} started {{performing}} at higher profile gigs {{such as the}} Warped Tour. Cuomo later remarked, [...] "We went in there fully expecting to be booed and to have things thrown at us. But it was exactly the opposite, people were singing along to all the songs and just going crazy, giving us the best support. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> gave us the confidence we needed." [...] The positive response to the Warped Tour performances led to further shows being scheduled. When touring began to wind down, MP3 demos captured live on the band's mobile unit and sound checks began to surface on file-sharing services and eventually for downloading on the band's official website. These songs were {{often referred to as}} Summer Songs of 2000 (commonly abbreviated as SS2K).|$|E
500|$|Andre Dellamorte of Collider called Item 47 [...] "silly". William Bibbiani of Crave Online said, [...] "The short {{is largely}} a success: [...] Hernandez, [...] Bradford and [...] Caplan are all in fine form although, [...] Welliver seems saddled with a little awkward dialogue, {{particularly}} in regards to Coulson, which doesn’t entirely sell." [...] Spencer Terry of Superhero Hype! said, [...] " [...] is easily the best one they've done, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{can be attributed to}} its length seeing as it's three times longer than the other One-Shots. With a longer run time, the short film doesn't have to rush to show us everything that it wants to - we get a clear understanding of both the S.H.I.E.L.D. perspective of the events and the robbers' point of view." ...|$|E
5000|$|Film critic Roger Ebert, {{giving it}} three stars out of four, wrote: [...] "Great Expectations {{begins as a}} great movie (I was spellbound by the first 30 minutes), but ends as only a good one, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> because the screenplay, by Mitch Glazer, too closely follows the romantic line." ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{few years}} after his third memoir was published, Knipfel stated in a 2007 {{interview}} with Leonard Lopate that he was finished writing memoirs, and instead would concentrate on fiction. His sentiment on his memoirs was: [...] "I had three of them out before <b>I</b> was forty, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> just asinine." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s he chaired the radio comedy show The News Quiz, {{returning}} to the show in 1996 for another ten years. In March 2006, Hoggart presented his last edition of The News Quiz commenting: [...] "I'm getting a bit clapped out <b>and</b> jaded, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> beginning to show." ...|$|R
