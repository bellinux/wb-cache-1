40|$|Climate change {{forecasts}} tell {{of significant}} challenges ahead for agrifood systems at all scales, from global to highly local. Farmers are {{often at the}} forefront of these challenges. How farmers perceive climate related risks, and the actions they take to protect or adapt their lives and livelihoods are therefore a critical area of inquiry. The purpose of this dissertation is to describe how farmers in Vermont, in the Northeastern U. S., think about climate change, and how their experiences and perceptions influence engagement with adaptation or mitigation activities. To this end, my research questions included: (1) what are farmers already doing to address climate impacts on their farms? (2) Do farmers perceive climate change to be a risk, and if so what are they doing to address it? (3) Are farmers and agricultural technical service providers in agreement about the current performance of climate change adaptation strategies? (4) Can a qualitative typology of farmers describe {{the degree to which they}} are resilient in the face of climate change? I conducted this research in the context of a larger, collaborative effort called the Vermont Agricultural Resilience in a Changing Climate Initiative (VAR), based at the University of Vermont. VAR served as an umbrella for transdisciplinary, participatory action research activities that capitalized on a diversity of perspectives and expertise, including the embedded knowledge of farmers and agricultural technical service providers. The VAR team as a whole and in sub-teams utilized a selection of research approaches including preliminary research activities that contributed to the development of research questions addressed in this dissertation, and primary research approaches used to answer those questions. This dissertation report consists of the following chapters: Chapters 1 - 2 present <b>and</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>and</b> <b>background</b> information related to climate change and agriculture, including a review of national, regional and site conditions as well as an overview of research purpose, approaches, methods, and theoretical frameworks applicable to the exploration of the questions and interpretation of findings. Chapters 3 - 6 address the following topics: (1) a case study in transdisciplinary participatory action research applied to climate change and agriculture in Vermont, (2) an analysis of farmer perceptions of climate related risk and associated on-farm adaptation strategies, (3) a report of farmer perceptions of climate change and comparison of farmer and technical service provider evaluations of potential climate change best management practices, and (4) a qualitative typology of farmer resilience. This research is some of the first to address these topics from the perspective of farmers in the Northeastern U. S. Through these chapters, an important story is told about role that climate change plays in farm management today. The broader application of these findings is in the design of thoughtful programming and policies that support agrifood system resilience. I argue that social programs and policies that address agriculture and climate change should be informed by the experiences of farmers. When we weave together the knowledge of agricultural practitioners and our best scientific knowledge, we can better prepare for the changes in agrifood systems that a changing climate will require of us...|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{decision tree}} {{was developed to}} aid in the choice of left-turn treatment at signalized intersections. Protected left-turns should be chosen in cases of high prevailing speeds, multiple left-turn lanes, limited sight distances and frequent crash occurrence. The rest of the cases constitute the majority of conditions at signalized intersections. Therefore, a methodology is proposed for combining a volume warrant with a delay warrant to resolve the issue generally. Threshold values of the left-turn volumes, above which protected left-turn phasing is justified, can be determined based on average delay. Reliable and easy-to-use regression models for warrants for protected left-turn phasing can be developed for typical intersection configurations, which would enable traffic engineers to rapidly and accurately determine the proper left-turn treatment.

40|$|Abstract: Given the {{stability}} of the bond between a mercaptide ligand and various redox-active metals, it is of interest that Nature has evolved significant metalloenzymatic processes that involve key interactions of sulfur-containing functionalities with metals such as Ni, Co, Cu, and Fe. From a chemical perspective, it is striking that these metals can function as robust biocatalysts in vivo, even though they are often “poisoned ” as catalysts in vitro through for-mation of refractory metal thiolates. Insight into the nature of this chemical discrepancy is under study in order to open new procedures in synthetic organic <b>and</b> organometallic chem-istry. <b>INTRODUCTION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>BACKGROUND</b> The highly discriminating activation of a stable carbon–sulfur moiety {{in the presence of a}} vast sea of oxygen and nitrogen heteroatoms plays a key role in a number of biochemical transformations [1 – 5].

This study {{quantified}} long-term {{changes in}} streamflows associated with clear-cutting and road construction and examined alternative hydrologic mechanisms to explain stream hydrograph {{changes in the}} Cascades Range, western Oregon. We examined differences in paired peak discharges for 150 to 375 storm events for five basin pairs, using 34 -year records from two pairs of 60 -to- 101 -ha experimental basins in the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, and 50 -to- 55 -year ecords from three pairs of adjacent basins ranging from 60 to 600 km 2.

Our {{ultimate goal is to}} optimally develop an effective, feasible, and cost-efficient water strategy in order to solve water crisis. Prediction model falls into a basic model and two extended models. The basic one models the problem as an improved gray prediction model (IGM). By applying IGM to fresh water needs and storage projection, we can predict future available water distribution that closely parallel to historical data. Typically, by predicting agricultural, industrial and daily-life needs separately, we obviously improve the precision of water needs projection model. Strategy decision use Water Strategy Decision (WSD) algorithm we proposed. In the graph we constructed every node represents a province and every edge means a fresh water dispatching strategy with weight.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the elastic buckling of pumpkin-shaped balloon structures. Pumpkin balloons, currently being used in the NASA Ultra-Long Duration Ballooning (ULDB) Program, consist of stiff meridional tendons that constrain a thin, highly curved plastic surface. The present study exploits the high degree of symmetry of this design by adopting a newly developed, closed form expression of a symmetry-adapted coordinate system for structures with n-fold symmetry, which provides the tangent stiffness matrix in a very efficient block-diagonal form. The critical buckling pressure of balloons with different properties are computed. It is found that for any chosen balloon there is a power law relation between the critical pressure and the number of lobes. The change in the power-law coefficients is used to study the sensitivity of different balloons to design parameters such as the shape of the lobe cutting pattern and the elastic properties of the membrane <b>and</b> tendons.

40|$|Realistic image {{synthesis}} {{is a major}} area {{of interest}} in computer graphics. One of the major challenges of rendering images realistically is achieving a full global illumination. The {{goal is to be}} able to define a scene with objects and lights and render that scene to make an image that looks real. Once the objects are defined, the challenge is to get the lighting right. Lighting an image is a complicated process because light is reflected, refracted, and absorbed by objects. Light is basically everywhere. In order to determine how much light that a specific point on an object receives, it is necessary to know the material properties of an object. The material properties of an object determine how light interacts with that object. For example, glass will reflect and refract light whereas a mirror will only reflect it. Some materials will absorb most light whereas others will reflect most of it. Current methods used to render realistic images include path tracing <b>and</b> photon mapping. <b>Introduction</b> <b>and</b> <b>Background</b> &quot;Realistic image synthesis is the process of creating synthetic images that are indistinguishable from images (such as photographs) of the real world. &quot; [1] The goal of this work is to explore methods of rendering an image within a reasonable amount of time, and having tha...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} {{is marked by}} a reduced life {{expectancy}} and a high symptom burden. For those who reach end-stage renal disease, the prognosis is poor, and this combined with the growing prevalence of the disease necessitates supportive and palliative care programmes that will address people’s psychosocial, cultural and spiritual needs. While there is variation between countries, research reveals that many renal specialist nurses and doctors are reluctant to address spirituality, initiate end-of-life conversations or implement conservative treatment plans early. Yet, other studies indicate that the provision of palliative care services, which includes the spiritual dimension, can reduce symptom burden, assist patients in making advanced directives/plans and improve health-related quality of life. This review brings together the current literature related to renal supportive care and spirituality under the following sections <b>and</b> themes. The <b>introduction</b> <b>and</b> <b>background</b> sections situate spirituality in both healthcare generally and chronic kidney disease. Gaps in the provision of chronic kidney disease spiritual care are then considered, followed by a discussion of the palliative care model related to chronic kidney disease and spirituality.

A particular focus on quality of life is developed, with spirituality named as a key dimension. Finally, further challenges, such as culture, training and limitations, are explicated...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{document}} {{provides guidance}} on quality assurance (QA) practices for sites using or planning to use rapid test kits to detect antibodies {{to the human}} immunodeficiency virus (HIV) waived under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) regulations. Definition: waived: rapid HIV tests: Waived rapid HIV tests are test devices or kits cleared by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that are determined to meet the criteria for waiver under CLIA. 1 They are simple, single-use, disposable devices, using minimal reagents, that can provide results in less than 60 minutes and are designed for use with unprocessed specimens (whole blood or oral fluid specimens). Rapid HIV tests, when used with specimens that require processing, such as plasma or serum, are not waived under CLIA. How rapid HIV tests are used: Rapid HIV tests are used as screening tests to detect antibodies to HIV as part of multi-test algorithms {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of infection with HIV. Positive (reactive) rapid HIV test results are preliminary and must be followed up with an approved confirmatory test. How to use these guidelines: These guidelines are intended to assist a range of providers in developing policies, processes and procedures to ensure high quality HIV testing services. The contents include a description of steps that should be taken to identify and prevent errors in the testing process. Because rapid HIV tests are used in many different settings, each site needs to decide how best to fit the various QA elements into its own operation. For example, the QA program in a large clinic or hospital where on-site laboratory support is available may be quite different from an outreach setting with fewer personnel <b>and</b> resources. <b>Introduction</b> <b>and</b> <b>background</b> [...] Basic elements of a quality assurance program [...] Organization of the quality assurance program [...] Testing personnel [...] Process control [...] Before testing [...] During testing [...] After testing [...] External assessment [...] Documents and records [...] Quality assurance monitoring and troubleshooting [...] References [...] Glossary.

(Public Management and Governance) This study {{starts with}} an <b>introduction</b> <b>and</b> <b>background,</b> <b>and</b> this is {{followed}} by a statement of the research problem, research rationale, research objectives, research design, research methodology and the data collection methods. A list of acronyms will be provided, as well as an overview of chapters, conclusions, and acknowledgements. “Around 5. 7 million in 2009 had contracted HIV and AIDS and in the preceding year 250, 000 South Africans died due to HIV/AIDS related diseases. All age categories and gender are prone to contracting the disease and the resultant loss of life has had a devastating effect on the workforce. Death due to this disease has caused loss of income and family disintegration” (Sottile 2013 : 2). In 2010, some 280, 000 South Africans died of HIV/AIDS. In the decade up to 2010, between 42 % and 47 % of all deaths among South Africans were HIV/AIDS-related deaths (Sottile 2013 : 2). Mlambo et al (2011 : 1) further say that “The Human Sciences Research Council estimates that 10. 9 % of all South Africans have HIV/AIDS. Additionally, the Central Intelligence Agency estimates that 310, 000 individuals died in South Africa from HIV/AIDS in the year 2009 ”. A study in 2003 made a comparison on two scenarios, an HIV/AIDS scenario and a no-HIV/AIDS scenario and this was based on the annual growth rates between 2002 and 2015. The finding was that “real growth in GDP would be 0. 6 % lower than if there were no HIV/AIDS, but per-capita growth in GDP would be 0. 9 % higher. Growth in population would have been 1. 5 % lower, and growth of the labour force would be 1. 2 % lower, but the unemployment rate would be 0. 9 % lower as well” (Avert. Org 2010 : 2). Different HIV/AIDS prevention strategies are being implemented in South Africa. The focus in this study is on male medical circumcision (hereafter MMC), which is the removal of {{all or part of the}} foreskin on the penis. It can either be performed surgically in hospitals or at initiation schools. Initiation schools perform the procedure as a traditional rite of passage from boyhood to manhood, and this is referred to as traditional male circumcision (TMC). This practice has up till now been performed purely for traditional or religious purposes, but it can no longer be viewed only as such. It should, instead, also be seen as a measure to curb the spread of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. A number of observational studies (which will be referenced later) found that circumcised men had smaller chances of contracting HIV infection compared with uncircumcised men [...] ...|$|R
