5|$|Although {{the case}} was filed in the Western District of Wisconsin, the judge there recused himself {{as a friend of}} the magazine. The case was {{therefore}} brought before Judge Robert W. Warren, a judge in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Because of the sensitive nature of information <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trial, two separate hearings were conducted, one in public, and the other in camera. The defendants, Morland and the editors of The Progressive, would not accept security clearances, which would put restraints on their free speech, and so were not present at the in camera hearings. Their lawyers did obtain clearances so that they could participate, but were forbidden from conveying anything they heard there to their clients.|$|E
5|$|San Martín did {{not take}} hostages or ask for ransoms, but rather he {{instructed}} his people to avoid further conflicts {{and to try to}} restore peaceful relations with the royalists. Zabala requested assistance for his wounded soldiers, which San Martín provided and he invited Zabala to share a large breakfast, which he accepted. San Martín was aware that the new enlightened ideas <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Napoleonic Wars influenced many of the Spanish military, and expected to convince Zabala that absolutism was a bad cause to defend. He succeeded, as Zabala joined the patriot forces under San Martín's command during his administration in Mendoza.|$|E
5|$|In October 2002, Triple H {{would begin}} a {{controversial}} feud with Kane, {{leading to a}} match at No Mercy on October 20 in which both Kane's Intercontinental Championship and Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship were <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> weeks preceding the match, Triple H claimed that, several years earlier, Kane had an unrequited relationship with a woman named Katie Vick. He went on to claim that, after Vick {{was killed in a}} car crash, Kane (the driver) raped her corpse. Triple H later threatened to show video footage of Kane committing the act in question; however, the footage that finally aired showed Triple H (dressed as Kane) simulating necrophilia with a mannequin in a casket; Kane's tag team partner The Hurricane responded the following week by showing a video of Triple H (rather, someone wearing a Triple H series of masks) getting an enema. The angle was very unpopular with fans, and was de-emphasized before the title match. Triple H went on to defeat Kane at No Mercy, unifying the two titles.|$|E

25|$|Clause 1 of Section 2 authorizes {{the federal}} courts to hear actual cases and controversies only.

500|$|The {{question}} of morality plays {{a large role}} in The Monster, especially in terms of compassion and tolerance. Several critics have pointed to the novella's non-absolute stance on these themes, mainly in regard to Dr. Trescott's ethical dilemma in his devotion to Henry, a black man and his son's savior. As author Patrick Dooley points out, [...] "What is <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Monster is that if Trescott is a moral man, Crane has rejected common-sense morality. If Trescott's actions are supererogative and saintly, however, he is to be applauded and admired, but the ordinary moral behavior of average people and the competence of everyday heroes will not have been expunged." [...] Crane scholar Stanley Wertheim also noted the duplicitous morality depicted by the town of Whilomville, which exhibits [...] "prejudice, fear and isolation in an environment traditionally associated with neighborliness and goodwill." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} year in command of the Virginia Regiment, Washington shaped the unit into one of the best provincial {{military}} units in the colonies. He rigorously enforced military discipline, often punishing transgressions with the lash, but also sometimes hanging those convicted of serious offenses like desertion. [...] The latter was a particular problem: many of the recruits were either foreigners or from Virginia's lower classes, and had little <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conflict. [...] He developed detailed guidelines for frontier warfare, was personally responsible for organizing the supply and equipment of the regiment, and even designed the regimental uniforms. [...] He was also a voracious reader of military treatises of all sorts, from Julius Caesar's Commentaries to recent British training manuals. [...] Despite all of his work, Virginia's frontier was ravaged by raiding parties, and he lost one third of his men in eighteen months. [...] Washington's relationship with Dinwiddie deteriorated again over these difficulties and ongoing complaints about pay that was inadequate compared to British regimental standards.|$|E

500|$|By early 1974, the Senate had {{rejected}} nineteen government bills, ten of them twice. With a half-Senate election due by mid-year, Whitlam looked {{for ways to}} shore up support in that body. [...] Queensland senator and former DLP leader Vince Gair signalled his willingness to leave the Senate for a diplomatic post. [...] Gair's term would not expire until the following half-Senate election (or upon a double dissolution election). With five Queensland seats <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> half-Senate election, the ALP would probably win only two, but if six (including Gair's) were at stake, the party likely would win a third. Possible control of the Senate was therefore at stake; Whitlam agreed to Gair's request and had Governor-General Sir Paul Hasluck appoint him ambassador to Ireland. Word leaked of Gair's pending resignation, and Whitlam's opponents attempted to counteract his manoeuvre. On {{what became known as}} the [...] "Night of the Long Prawns", Country Party members secreted Gair at a small party in a legislative office as the ALP searched for him to secure his written resignation. As Gair enjoyed beer and prawns, Bjelke-Petersen advised the Queensland governor, Sir Colin Hannah, to issue writs for only the usual five vacancies, since Gair's seat was not yet vacant, effectively countering Whitlam's plan.|$|E
