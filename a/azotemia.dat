25|$|Urea accumulates, {{leading to}} <b>azotemia</b> and {{ultimately}} uremia (symptoms ranging from lethargy to pericarditis and encephalopathy). Due to its high systemic circulation, urea is excreted in eccrine sweat at high concentrations and crystallizes on skin as the sweat evaporates ("uremic frost").|$|E
25|$|Expired {{tetracyclines}} or tetracyclines {{allowed to}} stand at a pH less than 2 are reported to be nephrotoxic due {{to the formation of}} a degradation product, anhydro-4-epitetracycline causing Fanconi syndrome. In the case of doxycycline, the absence of a hydroxyl group in C-6 prevents the formation of the nephrotoxic compound. Nevertheless, tetracyclines and doxycycline itself have to be taken with precaution in patients with kidney injury, as they can worsen <b>azotemia</b> due to catabolic effects.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} clinical complication of scleroderma involving the kidney is scleroderma renal crisis. Symptoms of scleroderma renal crisis are malignant hypertension (high blood pressure {{with evidence of}} acute organ damage), hyperreninemia (high renin levels), <b>azotemia</b> (kidney failure with accumulation of waste products in the blood) and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells). Apart from the high blood pressure, hematuria (blood in the urine) and proteinuria (protein loss in the urine) may be indicative.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{dose range}} for {{induction}} of anesthesia using thiopental is from 3 to 6mg/kg; however, {{there are many}} factors that can alter this. Premedication with sedatives such as benzodiazepines or clonidine will reduce requirements, as do specific disease states and other patient factors. Among patient factors are: age, sex, and lean body mass. Specific disease conditions that can alter the dose requirements of thiopentone {{and for that matter}} any other intravenous anaesthetic are: hypovolemia, burns, <b>azotemia,</b> hepatic failure, hypoproteinemia, etc.|$|E
25|$|Renal failure (kidney failure) * {{is common}} in dogs and {{may be found in}} acute or chronic forms. It is defined by a loss of {{function}} of about 75 percent of the filtration system of the kidney and characterized by <b>azotemia</b> and low specific gravity of the urine. Acute renal failure can be caused by loss of blood supply, hypercalcemia, or toxins such as ethylene glycol (antifreeze) or aminoglycoside antibiotics (see: ethylene glycol poisoning). Chronic renal failure can be congenital and/or inherited or caused by cancer, infection, hypertension, glomerulonephritis, amyloidosis, progressive interstitial fibrosis, or any of the causes of acute renal failure.|$|E
25|$|Fluid {{support is}} {{essential}} to maintain blood pressure, often {{with the help of}} colloids or hypertonic saline. NSAIDs are commonly given to reduce systemic inflammation. However, they decrease the levels of certain prostaglandins that normally promote healing of the intestinal mucosa, which subsequently increases the amount of endotoxin absorbed. To counteract this, NSAIDs are sometimes administered with a lidocaine drip, which appears to reduce this particular negative effect. Flunixin may be used for this purpose at a dose lower than that used for analgesia, so can be safely given to a colicky horse without risking masking signs that the horse requires surgery. Other drugs that bind endotoxin, such as polymyxin B and Bio-Sponge, are also often used. Polymixin B prevents endotoxin from binding to inflammatory cells, but is potentially nephrotoxic, so should be used with caution in horses with <b>azotemia,</b> especially neonatal foals. Plasma may also be given with the intent of neutralizing endotoxin.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{symptoms}} of vitamin D overdose which {{are those of}} hypercalcemia including anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. [...] These may be followed by polyuria, polydipsia, weakness, insomnia, nervousness, pruritus and ultimately renal failure. [...] Furthermore, proteinuria, urinary casts, <b>azotemia,</b> and metastatic calcification (especially in the kidneys) may develop. [...] Other {{symptoms of}} vitamin D toxicity include mental retardation in young children, abnormal bone growth and formation, diarrhea, irritability, weight loss, and severe depression.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Azotemia</b> {{has three}} classifications, {{depending}} on its causative origin. A BUN/Cr > 20 tends to herald prerenal <b>azotemia</b> (commonly secondary to dehydration but also {{any other reason}} perfusion to kidneys is decreased). [...] The BUN-to-creatinine ratio (BUN:Cr) is a useful measure in determining the type of <b>azotemia.</b> A normal BUN:Cr is equal to 15.|$|E
50|$|<b>Azotemia</b> {{is another}} word {{that refers to}} high levels of urea but is used {{primarily}} when the abnormality can be measured chemically but is not yet so severe as to produce symptoms. Uremia is the pathological manifestations of severe <b>azotemia.</b>|$|E
50|$|The BUN:Cr in postrenal <b>azotemia</b> is {{initially}} >15. The increased nephron tubular pressure (due to fluid back-up) causes increased reabsorption of urea, elevating it abnormally relative to creatinine. Persistent obstruction damages the tubular epithelium over time, and renal <b>azotemia</b> will result with a decreased BUN:Cr ratio.|$|E
50|$|Prompt {{treatment}} of some causes of <b>azotemia</b> {{can result in}} restoration of kidney function; delayed treatment may result in permanent loss of renal function. Treatment may include hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, medications to increase cardiac output and increase blood pressure, and the {{treatment of}} the condition that caused the <b>azotemia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other severe manifestations include extreme fatigue, hearing loss, {{respiratory}} distress, and <b>azotemia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Stage 3 {{the patient}} {{develops}} shock with <b>azotemia</b> and acid-base disturbances; has significant coagulation abnormalities.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{also seen}} in some {{patients}} with kidney failure and <b>azotemia,</b> and in carbon dioxide toxicity.|$|E
50|$|Blockage {{of urine}} flow {{in an area}} below the kidneys results in postrenal <b>azotemia.</b> It {{can be caused by}} {{congenital}} abnormalities such as vesicoureteral reflux, blockage of the ureters by kidney stones, pregnancy, compression of the ureters by cancer, prostatic hyperplasia, or blockage of the urethra by kidney or bladder stones. Like in prerenal <b>azotemia,</b> there is no inherent renal disease. The increased resistance to urine flow can cause back up into the kidneys, leading to hydronephrosis.|$|E
50|$|Uremic {{pericarditis}} {{is correlated}} {{to the degree}} of <b>azotemia</b> in the system. BUN is normally >60 mg/dL (normal is 7-20 mg/dL). The pathogenesis is poorly understood.|$|E
50|$|In pre-renal and post-renal azotemias, {{elevation}} of the BUN exceeds that of the creatinine (i.e., BUN>12*creatinine). This is because BUN is readily absorbed while creatinine is not. In congestive heart failure (a cause of pre-renal <b>azotemia)</b> or any other condition that causes poor perfusion of kidneys, the sluggish flow of glomerular filtrate results in excessive absorption of BUN and {{elevation of}} its value in blood. Creatinine, however, is not absorbable and therefore does not rise significantly. Stasis of urine in post-renal <b>azotemia</b> has the same effect.|$|E
5000|$|Kidney: 25 percent develop {{signs of}} {{nephrotoxicity}} ranging from mild, asymptomatic <b>azotemia</b> (increased serum creatinine and urea) to irreversible renal failure. Ample fluids or intravenous hydration may prevent some nephrotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|Renal <b>azotemia</b> (acute renal failure) {{typically}} {{leads to}} uremia. It is an intrinsic {{disease of the}} kidney, generally the result of renal parenchymal damage. Causes include renal failure, glomerulonephritis, acute tubular necrosis, or {{any other kind of}} renal disease.|$|E
5000|$|Urea accumulates, {{leading to}} <b>azotemia</b> and {{ultimately}} uremia (symptoms ranging from lethargy to pericarditis and encephalopathy). Due to its high systemic circulation, urea is excreted in eccrine sweat at high concentrations and crystallizes on skin as the sweat evaporates ("uremic frost").|$|E
50|$|Prerenal <b>azotemia</b> {{is caused}} by a {{decrease}} in blood flow (hypoperfusion) to the kidneys. However, there is no inherent kidney disease. It can occur following hemorrhage, shock, volume depletion, congestive heart failure, adrenal insufficiency, and narrowing of the renal artery among other things.|$|E
50|$|Mild to {{moderate}} anaemia, hypoproteinaemia, mild {{to moderate}} renal <b>azotemia,</b> retinal haemorrhages, and glaucoma are common manifestations. There is no specific therapy. Removal of the adulterated oil and symptomatic treatment of congestive cardiac failure and respiratory symptoms, along with administration of antioxidants and multivitamins, remain the mainstay of treatment.|$|E
50|$|Prerenal <b>azotemia</b> can {{be caused}} by {{decreased}} blood flow through the kidneys (e.g. low blood pressure, congestive heart failure, shock, bleeding, dehydration) or by increased production of urea in the liver via a high protein diet or increased protein catabolism (e.g. stress, fever, major illness, corticosteroid therapy or gastrointestinal bleeding).|$|E
50|$|Health {{problems}} {{can result from}} a disturbance to the circadian rhythm. Circadian rhythms also {{play a part in}} the reticular activating system, which is crucial for maintaining a state of consciousness. A reversal in the sleep-wake cycle may be a sign or complication of uremia, <b>azotemia</b> or acute renal failure.|$|E
50|$|If {{hyponatremia}} (low sodium) and hyperkalemia (high potassium) are severe, {{the resulting}} hypovolemia, prerenal <b>azotemia,</b> and cardiac arrhythmias {{may result in}} an Addisonian crisis. In severe cases, the patient may be presented in shock and moribund. Addisonian crisis must be differentiated from other life-threatening disorders such as diabetic ketoacidosis, necrotizing pancreatitis, and septic peritonitis.|$|E
50|$|The embryological {{link between}} the urinary tract, the genital system, and the {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{is the basis of}} the radiation of pain to the gonads, as well as the nausea and vomiting that are also common in urolithiasis. Postrenal <b>azotemia</b> and hydronephrosis can be observed following the obstruction of urine flow through one or both ureters.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Azotemia</b> (azot, [...] "nitrogen" [...] + , [...] "blood {{condition}}") is {{a medical}} condition characterized by abnormally high levels of nitrogen-containing compounds (such as urea, creatinine, various body waste compounds, and other nitrogen-rich compounds) in the blood. It is largely related to insufficient or dysfunctional filtering of blood by the kidneys. It can lead to uremia if not controlled.|$|E
50|$|Since {{animals are}} {{potentially}} suffering from severe metabolic derangements {{at the time}} of initial presentation, animals need to be stabilized prior to surgery. Common physiologic derangements noted on bloodwork are elevated kidneys values (<b>azotemia)</b> and elevated potassium levels (hyperkalemia). The presence of profound sedation, low body temperature, and/or a slow heart rate (bradycardia) are usually associated with more severe blood derangements.|$|E
50|$|While most infants born {{to mothers}} who have SLE are healthy, mothers with SLE as an intercurrent disease in {{pregnancy}} should remain under medical care until delivery. In general, women with SLE and, in addition, hypertension, proteinuria, and <b>azotemia</b> {{have an extra}} increased risk for pregnancy complications. Pregnancy outcomes in women with SLE who receive renal transplants {{are similar to those}} of transplant recipients without SLE.|$|E

50|$|The FENa is {{generally}} less than 1% {{in patients with}} hepatorenal syndrome and acute glomerulonephropathy. Although often reliable at discriminating between prerenal <b>azotemia</b> and acute tubular necrosis, the FENa {{has been reported to}} be <1% occasionally with oliguric and nonoliguric acute tubular necrosis, urinary tract obstruction, acute glomerulonephritis, renal allograft rejection, sepsis, and drug-related alterations in renal hemodynamics. Therefore, the utility of the test is best when used in conjunction with other clinical data.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} clinical complication of scleroderma involving the kidney is scleroderma renal crisis. Symptoms of scleroderma renal crisis are malignant hypertension (high blood pressure {{with evidence of}} acute organ damage), hyperreninemia (high renin levels), <b>azotemia</b> (kidney failure with accumulation of waste products in the blood) and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells). Apart from the high blood pressure, hematuria (blood in the urine) and proteinuria (protein loss in the urine) may be indicative.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms {{can vary}} from person to person. Someone in early stage kidney disease may not feel sick or notice {{symptoms}} as they occur. When kidneys fail to filter properly, waste accumulates in the blood and the body, a condition called <b>azotemia.</b> Very low levels of azotaemia may produce few, if any, symptoms. If the disease progresses, symptoms become noticeable (if the failure is of sufficient degree to cause symptoms). Kidney failure accompanied by noticeable symptoms is termed uraemia.|$|E
5000|$|Mild {{increases}} in the blood levels of nitrogen and uric acid can also develop. Advanced kidney failure and high blood urea levels occur in 10% of cases. Pathologic examination reveals the typical lesion of [...] "hyperfiltration nephropathy" [...] namely, focal segmental glomerular sclerosis. This finding {{has led to the}} suggestion that anemia-induced hyperfiltration in childhood is the principal cause of the adult glomerulopathy. Nephron loss secondary to ischemic injury also contributes to the development of <b>azotemia</b> in these patients.|$|E
