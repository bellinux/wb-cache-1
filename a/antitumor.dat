5|$|Biologically active {{mushroom}} polysaccharides {{have been}} a frequent research topic in recent decades due to their possible stimulatory effect on innate and cell-mediated immune responses, <b>antitumor</b> activities, and other activities. Immunostimulatory activity, antioxidant activity, cholesterol-lowering, and blood sugar-lowering effects have been detected in extracts of R.virescens fruit bodies, which are attributed to polysaccharides. A water-insoluble beta-glucan, RVS3-II, has been isolated from the fruit bodies. Sulfated derivatives of this compound have <b>antitumor</b> activities against sarcoma tumor cell lines. RVP, a water-soluble polysaccharide present in the mushroom, is made largely of galactomannan subunits and has antioxidant activity.|$|E
5|$|Sesquiterpene lactones are {{a diverse}} group of biologically active {{compounds}} that are being investigated for their antiinflammatory and <b>antitumor</b> activities. Some of these compounds have been isolated and chemically characterized from Russula brevipes: russulactarorufin, lactarorufin-A, and 24-ethyl-cholesta-7,22E-diene-3β,5α,6β-triol.|$|E
5|$|Extracts of the puffball {{have strong}} <b>antitumor</b> {{activity}} in mouse models attributable to protein-bound polysaccharides, the compounds calvatan, craniformin, and a tautomer of rubroflavin. Calvatan {{is thought to}} act by stimulating the immune response, rather than by killing cells. Craniformin, originally reported in 1997, is an azoformamide compound. Three sterol compounds have been identified from the fungus: ergosta-4,6,8(14), 22-tetraene-3-one, ergosta-7,22-diene-3-ol, and ergosterol peroxide.|$|E
5|$|Common {{side effects}} include hair loss, bone marrow suppression, vomiting, rash, and {{inflammation}} of the mouth. Other serious side effects may include allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis, heart damage, tissue damage {{at the site of}} injection, radiation recall, and treatment-related leukemia. People often experience red discoloration of the urine for a few days. Doxorubicin is in the anthracycline and <b>antitumor</b> antibiotic family of medications. It works in part by interfering with the function of DNA.|$|E
5|$|Extracts of Narcissus have {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} potentially useful biological properties including antiviral, prophage induction, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, <b>antitumor,</b> antimitotic, antiplatelet, hypotensive, emetic, acetylcholine esterase inhibitory, antifertility, antinociceptive, chronotropic, pheromone, plant growth inhibitor, and allelopathic. An ethanol extract of Narcissus bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of nociception, para-benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction, but not in another, the hot plate test. Most of these properties are due to alkaloids, but some are also due to mannosa-binding lectins. The most-studied alkaloids in this group are galantamine (galanthamine), lycorine, narciclasine, and pretazettine.|$|E
5|$|Other {{metabolites}} {{isolated from}} different species include dibenzonaphtyridinone alkaloids, prenylated phenols, benzofurans, chromenes, natural rubber (polyisoprene), sterols, and the sugar alcohol volemitol. Among toxic substances, Lactarius turpis contains the mutagenic alkaloid necatorin, {{and the small}} compound cycloprop-2-ene carboxylic acid {{has been identified as}} the toxic agent in Russula subnigricans. Some secondary metabolites showed antibiotic properties in laboratory tests. An ethanolic extract of Russula delica was antibacterial, and a lectin from Russula rosea showed <b>antitumor</b> activity.|$|E
5|$|Polyketides are {{synthesized}} by polymerization of acetyl and propionyl subunits by classic enzymes {{as well as}} iterative and multimodular {{enzymes that}} share mechanistic features with the fatty acid synthases. They comprise {{a large number of}} secondary metabolites and natural products from animal, plant, bacterial, fungal and marine sources, and have great structural diversity. Many polyketides are cyclic molecules whose backbones are often further modified by glycosylation, methylation, hydroxylation, oxidation, or other processes. Many commonly used anti-microbial, anti-parasitic, and anti-cancer agents are polyketides or polyketide derivatives, such as erythromycins, tetracyclines, avermectins, and <b>antitumor</b> epothilones.|$|E
25|$|The C- and D-rings have an {{essential}} role in the <b>antitumor</b> activity. Replacement in any position results in much less potent compound than parent compound in other cytotoxicity assay.|$|E
25|$|The ATPase-binding {{region of}} Hsp90 is {{currently}} under intense study, {{because it is}} the principal binding site of drugs targeting this protein. <b>Antitumor</b> drugs targeting this section of Hsp90 include the antibiotics geldanamycin, herbimycin, radicicol, deguelin, derrubone, macbecin, and beta-lactams.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the Office of Technology Assessment {{issued a}} report on herbal cancer treatments. This group found that while many {{elements}} of Hoxsey Therapy had <b>antitumor</b> activity in vitro, the complete Hoxsey tonic had never been tested in animal models or in human clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|In {{parallel}} work, other {{compounds that}} successfully blocked {{the synthesis of}} nucleic acids had been proven to be both antibacterial, antiviral, and anticancer agents, the leading work being done at the laboratory of Nobel laureates George Hitchings and Gertrude Elion, leading {{to the development of}} the <b>antitumor</b> agent 6-mercaptopurine.|$|E
25|$|Electrochemotherapy is the {{combined}} treatment in which injection of a chemotherapeutic drug {{is followed by}} application of high-voltage electric pulses locally to the tumor. The treatment enables the chemotherapeutic drugs, which otherwise cannot or hardly go through the membrane of cells (such as bleomycin and cisplatin), to enter the cancer cells. Hence, greater effectiveness of <b>antitumor</b> treatment is achieved.|$|E
25|$|A known {{relationship}} between intra-operative blood transfusion and cancer recurrence {{has been established}} in colorectal cancer. In lung cancer intra-operative blood transfusion has been associated with earlier recurrence of cancer, worse survival rates and poorer outcomes after lung resection. Also studies shown to us, failure of the immune system caused by blood transfusion can be categorized as one of the main factors leading to more than 10 different cancer types that are fully associated with blood transfusion and the innate and adaptive immune system. Allogeneic blood transfusion, through five major mechanisms including the lymphocyte-T set, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), natural killer cells (NKCs), and dendritic cells (DCs) can help the recipient’s defense mechanisms. On the other hand, the role for each of the listed items includes activation of the <b>antitumor</b> CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+/CTL), temporal inactivation of Tregs, inactivation of the STAT3 signaling pathway, the use of bacteria to enhance the <b>antitumor</b> immune response and cellular Immunotherapy.|$|E
25|$|People {{with cancer}} {{undergoing}} chemotherapy are often given dexamethasone to counteract certain {{side effects of}} their <b>antitumor</b> treatments. Dexamethasone can increase the antiemetic effect of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron. The exact mechanism of this interaction is not well-defined, {{but it has been}} theorized that this effect may be due to, among many other causes, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, anti-inflammatory effects, immunosuppressive effects, decreased release of endogenous opioids, or a combination of the aforementioned.|$|E
25|$|Recombinant IFNα2 (α2a and α2b) has {{demonstrated}} efficiency {{in the treatment}} of patients diagnosed with some viral infections (such as chronic viral hepatitis B and hepatitis C) or some kinds of cancer (melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and various hematological malignancies). Yet, patients on therapy with IFNα2 suffer from adverse effects which often require to reduce or even stop the treatment. These adverse effects include flu-like symptoms such as chills, fever, joint and muscle pain, depression with suicidal ideation, and a {{reduction in the number of}} blood cells. Thereby, IFNα2 has been progressively replaced by better tolerated drugs, such as antiviral agents or targeted <b>antitumor</b> therapies. Chronic viral hepatitis C is the main indication for which IFNα2 remains widely used. Nevertheless, there is increasing evidence that endogenous type I IFNs plays a role in the induction of an immune antiviral response and that they can enhance the <b>antitumor</b> activity of chemotherapies, radiotherapies and some targeted therapies. Therefore, an important future goal for scientists is to modify IFNα2 in order to obtain an active molecule to be used in the clinic that does not exert adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|The Bohemic acid {{complex is}} a mixture of {{chemicals}} obtained through fermentation of a species of actinobacteria. In 1977 the components were isolated and have been found useful as <b>antitumor</b> agents and anthracycline antibiotics. The authors named the complex (and one of its components, bohemamine) after the opera La bohème by Puccini, and the remaining components were named after characters in the opera: alcindoromycin (Alcindoro), collinemycin (Colline), marcellomycin (Marcello), mimimycin (Mimi), musettamycin (Musetta), rudolphomycin (Rodolfo) and schaunardimycin (Schaunard). However, the relationships between the characters do not correctly reflect the chemical relationships.|$|E
25|$|Charged {{particles}} such as {{protons and}} boron, carbon, and neon ions can cause direct damage to cancer cell DNA through high-LET (linear energy transfer) {{and have an}} <b>antitumor</b> effect independent of tumor oxygen supply because these particles act mostly via direct energy transfer usually causing double-stranded DNA breaks. Due to their relatively large mass, protons and other charged particles have little lateral side scatter in the tissue—the beam does not broaden much, stays focused on the tumor shape, and delivers small dose side-effects to surrounding tissue. They also more precisely target the tumor using the Bragg peak effect. See proton therapy for {{a good example of}} the different effects of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) vs. charged particle therapy. This procedure reduces damage to healthy tissue between the charged particle radiation source and the tumor and sets a finite range for tissue damage after the tumor has been reached. In contrast, IMRT's use of uncharged particles causes its energy to damage healthy cells when it exits the body. This exiting damage is not therapeutic, can increase treatment side effects, and increases the probability of secondary cancer induction. This difference is very important in cases where the close proximity of other organs makes any stray ionization very damaging (example: head and neck cancers).|$|E
500|$|Mushroom polysaccharides from {{a number}} of species have {{attracted}} research interest for their immunomodulatory and <b>antitumor</b> properties. Extracts from A.hygrometricus containing the polysaccharide named AE2 were found to inhibit the growth of several tumor cell lines in laboratory tests, [...] and stimulated the growth of splenocytes, thymocytes, and bone marrow cells from mice. The extract also stimulated mouse cells associated with the immune system; specifically, it enhanced the activity of mouse natural killer cells, stimulated macrophages to produce nitric oxide, and enhanced production of cytokines. The activation of macrophages by AE2 might be mediated by a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway of signal transduction. AE2 is made of the simple sugars mannose, glucose, and fucose in a 1:2:1 ratio.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the lethal}} {{potential}} of Narcissus alkaloids, {{they have been}} used for centuries as traditional medicines for a variety of complaints, including cancer. Plants thought to be N. poeticus [...] and N. tazetta are described in the Bible in the treatment for what is thought to be cancer. In the Classical Greek world Hippocrates (ca. B.C. 460–370) recommended a pessary prepared from narcissus oil for uterine tumors, a practice continued by Pedanius Dioscorides (ca. A.D. 40–90) and Soranus of Ephesus (A.D. 98–138) in the first and second centuries A.D., while the Roman Pliny the Elder (A.D. 23–79), advocated topical use. The bulbs of N. poeticus contain the antineoplastic agent narciclasine. This usage is also found in later Arabian, North African, Central American and Chinese medicine during the Middle Ages. In China N. tazetta var. chinensis was grown as an ornamental plant but the bulbs were applied topically to tumors in traditional folk medicine. These bulbs contain pretazettine, an active <b>antitumor</b> compound.|$|E

2500|$|Most enediynes, {{including}} the ones listed above, {{have been used}} as potent <b>antitumor</b> antibiotics due to their ability to efficiently cleave DNA. [...] Calicheamicin and esperamicin are the two most commonly used types due to their high specificity when binding to DNA, which minimizes unfavorable side reactions. They {{have been shown to be}} especially useful for treating acute myeloid leukemia.|$|E
2500|$|Dynemicin and its {{relatives}} {{are characterized by}} the presence of an anthraquinone and enediyne core. [...] The anthraquinone component allows for specific binding of DNA at the 3’ side of purine bases through intercalation, a site that is different from calicheamicin. [...] Its ability to cleave DNA is greatly increased in the presence of NADPH and thiol compounds. [...] This compound has also found prominence as an <b>antitumor</b> agent.|$|E
2500|$|Quercetin is a {{principal}} flavonoid compound and an excellent free-radical-scavenging antioxidant that promotes apoptosis. In vitro it shows some <b>antitumor</b> activity in oral cancer and leukemia. Cultured skin and prostate cancer cells showed significant mortality (compared to nonmalignant cells) when treated {{with a combination of}} quercetin and ultrasound. [...] Note that ultrasound also promotes topical absorption by up to 1,000 times, making the use of topical quercetin and ultrasound wands an interesting proposition.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} health industry, {{antimicrobial}} surfaces have been utilized {{for their ability to}} keep surfaces cleaned. Either the physical nature of the surface, [...] or the chemical make up can be manipulated to create an environment which cannot be inhabited by microorganisms for a variety of different reasons. Photocatalytic materials have been used for their ability to kill many microorganisms and therefore can be used for self-cleaning surfaces as well as air cleaning, water purification, and <b>antitumor</b> activity.|$|E
2500|$|Orlistat {{was also}} {{recently}} found to inhibit the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase (FAS), an enzyme {{involved in the}} proliferation of cancer cells but not normal cells. However, potential side effects of Orlistat, such as inhibition of other cellular off-targets or poor bioavailability, might hamper its application as an effective <b>antitumor</b> agent. One profiling study undertook a chemical proteomics approach to look for new cellular targets of orlistat, including its off-targets [...] Orlistat also show potential activities mycobacteria and Trypanosoma brucei parasite (See further reading).|$|E
2500|$|Alkynes {{occur in}} some pharmaceuticals, {{including}} the contraceptive noretynodrel. A carbon–carbon triple bond is {{also present in}} marketed drugs such as the antiretroviral Efavirenz and the antifungal Terbinafine. Molecules called ene-diynes feature a ring containing an alkene ("ene") between two alkyne groups ("diyne"). These compounds, e.g. calicheamicin, {{are some of the}} most aggressive <b>antitumor</b> drugs known, so much so that the ene-diyne subunit is sometimes referred to as a [...] "warhead". Ene-diynes undergo rearrangement via the Bergman cyclization, generating highly reactive radical intermediates that attack DNA within the tumor.|$|E
2500|$|Stähelin quickly {{assumed the}} {{leading role in the}} {{discovery}} and development of Podophyllum compounds; four of them, including etoposide (Vepesid), were later marketed. He was able to detect in a partially purified, chemically modified extract of the Podophyllum plant the presence of a then-unknown agent with interesting properties, which had at first been considered by the chemists to be [...] "dirt". The chemists, under the direction of A. von Wartburg, analysed this impurity. Guided by Stähelin's in-vitro and in-vivo assays, they found the active compound responsible for the good <b>antitumor</b> activity of SP-G (Proresid oral) and SP-I (Proresid intravenous; discovered in April 1959, commercialized 1963). Further chemical modifications led to the well-known thenylidene derivative VM-26 (teniposide, Vumon, discovered in October 1965, commercialized by Sandoz in 1976) and to the ethylidene derivative VP-16-213 (etoposide, Vepesid, discovered on October 21, 1966), which remains very clinically successful.|$|E
2500|$|More recently, {{in vitro}} data in animal models {{suggests}} intravenous ascorbic acid at high doses may hold some promise {{in the treatment}} of cancer; however, this has not been supported in more rigorous clinical trials in humans. [...] Preliminary clinical trials in humans have shown that it is unlikely to be a [...] "miracle pill" [...] for cancer and more research is necessary before any definitive conclusions about efficacy can be reached. [...] A 2010 review of 33 years of research on vitamin C to treat cancer stated [...] "we have to conclude that we still do not know whether Vitamin C has any clinically significant <b>antitumor</b> activity. Nor do we know which histological types of cancers, if any, are susceptible to this agent. Finally, we don't know what the recommended dose of Vitamin C is, if there is indeed such a dose, that can produce an anti-tumor response." ...|$|E
