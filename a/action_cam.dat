30|$|Video {{summarization}} is the condensation {{of a video}} into a storyboard {{that contains}} keyframes or several video segments [2], the goal {{of which is to}} make the video as small as possible while keeping the flow of the story and essential parts of frames and/or video clips. There have been a huge number of methods for the summarization of well-edited videos such as movies and TV contents [3 – 6], where a well-edited video means that it has clear shot boundaries and was shot under well-controlled environments with stable and high-quality cameras. In contrast to these well-edited videos, consumer videos (shot by hand-held mobile cameras, camcorders, or egocentric cameras such as sports glasses and <b>action</b> <b>cams)</b> usually have unclear or no shot boundaries and also contain many low-quality frames or even meaningless ones. Hence, above mentioned video summarization methods, which were designed for the well-edited videos, do not work well for consumer videos, so recent studies are targeting consumer videos [2, 7 – 9].|$|R

Video blog is a recent approach for sharing videos, in which users enjoy expressing themselves in blog posts with attractive videos.

In this paper, we propose a novel video summarization method for helping users to create a video blog post. Unlike typical video summarization methods, the proposed method utilizes the text, which is written for a video blog post, and makes the video summary consistent with {{the content of the}} text. For this, we perform video summarization by solving an optimization problem, in which an objective function involves the content similarity between the summarized video and the text.

The contest was interpreted locally as a referendum on independence. The election was won by a small margin. The constituency No. 15 was capital to the winning of the pro-independence coalition.

40|$|The <b>action</b> <b>cam</b> phenomenon: a {{new trend}} in {{audiovisual}} production When the GoPro camera was first put {{on the market in}} 2004, it brought about a new generation of ultracompact cameras designed to be attached to the user’s body, and which {{came to be known as}} action cams. Their principal characteristics were their tiny size, their high-quality images and a wide-angle, fixed-focal-length lens.

Considering the distinction Michel de Certeau’s has made between (abstract) maps and (personalized) tours, I explore the way in which these images construct a form of moving-image cartography – a firstperson cartography that fits today’s pervasive visual trope of navigation...|$|E
40|$|Mediation is {{the process}} of decomposing a task into subtasks, finding agents {{suitable}} for these subtasks and negotiating with agents to obtain commitments to execute these subtasks. This process involves several decisions to be made by a mediator including which tasks to mediate, when to interrupt the current task mediation to pursue a better task, etc. The main contribution of this work is integrating the different aspects of a mediator decision problem into one coherent and simple decision theoretic model. This model is then used to learn an optimal policy for a mediator. We propose a generalization of the original Semi-MDP (SMDP) model, which allows efficient representation of the mediator decision problem. Also the concurrent <b>action</b> model (<b>CAM)</b> is extended to allow better performing policies to be found.

Active protection is achieved by orienting the webbing so that a pull causes a <b>camming</b> <b>action</b> against the rock similar to Tricams, allowing for placement in parallel cracks. They are often preferred by alpine mountaineers over spring-loaded camming devices because of their lack of moving parts and overall lower weight for the same size crack.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the slide}} of the pistol enters battery, the striker engages the sear. At this point, the sear is held {{back in a}} {{partially}} cocked condition. When the trigger of the M&P is pulled, the trigger bar first engages the firing pin safety plunger, lifting it upward, and releasing firing pin safety. At the rearward extreme of the trigger bar's travel, it engages the sear. The sear is rotated downward by the trigger bar, fully cocking, then releasing the striker. The striker makes contact with the primer of the chambered round, which in turn ignites the gunpowder and propels the bullet forward. According to renowned M&P gunsmith Dan Burwell, the angle on the rear face of the sear creates a <b>camming</b> <b>action</b> against the striker. This <b>camming</b> <b>action</b> moves the striker to the rear very slightly during the trigger pull, thus finishing the [...] "cocking". This system {{is similar to the}} partially tensioned striker found in the Glock series of pistols. When the pistol cycles for the next shot, the striker will be automatically pre-set in a 98% cocked position. Because the striker is only 98% cocked prior to the trigger being pulled, Smith & Wesson classifies the M&P's action as [...] "striker fired (double action only)".|$|R
