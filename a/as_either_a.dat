5|$|The tor {{and other}} sites in Glastonbury {{have also been}} {{significant}} in Goddess worship, with the flow from the Chalice Well representing menstrual flow and the tor being seen <b>as</b> <b>either</b> <b>a</b> breast or the whole figure of the Goddess.

5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify <b>as</b> <b>either</b> <b>a</b> metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidant dietary {{supplements}} do not improve health {{nor are they}} effective in preventing diseases as shown by randomized clinical trials including supplements of beta-carotene, vitamin A, and vitamin E singly or in different combinations having no effect on mortality rate or cancer risk. Supplementation with selenium or vitamin E does not {{reduce the risk of}} cardiovascular disease. Oxidative stress can be considered <b>as</b> <b>either</b> <b>a</b> cause or consequence of some diseases, an area of research stimulating drug development for antioxidant compounds for use as potential therapies.|$|E

5|$|As a halogen, {{astatine}} {{tends to}} be classified as a nonmetal. It has some marked metallic properties and is sometimes instead classified <b>as</b> <b>either</b> <b>a</b> metalloid or (less often) as a metal. Immediately following its production in 1940, early investigators considered it a metal. In 1949 {{it was called the}} most noble (difficult to reduce) nonmetal as well as being a relatively noble (difficult to oxidize) metal. In 1950 astatine was described as a halogen and (therefore) a reactive nonmetal. In 2013, on the basis of relativistic modelling, astatine was predicted to be a monatomic metal, with a face-centred cubic crystalline structure.|$|E
5|$|Baker's last {{published}} work, Right Wing, {{as well as}} his posthumous novels Testosterone and Anarchy, {{represent a}} stylistic departure in that he inserts himself into the plot <b>as</b> <b>either</b> <b>a</b> secondary character or the protagonist. The latter two were edited, {{and in the case of}} Anarchy, partially rewritten by his editor, Scott Brassart. Testosterone needed only minor changes, while Anarchy underwent an entire rewrite, with Brassart restructuring the plot and streamlining over 500 pages of prose and notes into a fast-paced, 250 page novel. For the reader, however, it is only Baker's voice as writer that is heard.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{studies of}} morphology, the bluebuck has {{historically}} been classified <b>as</b> <b>either</b> <b>a</b> distinct species or as a subspecies of the roan antelope. After its extinction, some 19th-century naturalists began to doubt its validity as a species, with some believing the museum specimens to be small or immature roan antelopes, and both species were lumped together under the name A.leucophaeus by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1821. The Austrian zoologist Franz Friedrich Kohl pointed out the distinct features of the bluebuck in 1866, followed by Sclater and Thomas, who rejected the synonymy in 1899.|$|E

5|$|Engineers from AG Weser, UB-45s German builder, {{inspected}} the hulk {{and determined that}} repair of the wreck was feasible. A restoration of the submarine to operating condition, <b>as</b> <b>either</b> <b>a</b> training vessel or a military, would cost 21 million leva (about US$250,000 in 1936 dollars), significantly less than the 56 to 65 million leva ($680,000 to $790,000) that a comparable new submarine would cost. Ultimately, the Bulgarian Navy opted to order new submarines from Germany rather than repair UB-45. UB-45s deck gun was reused, however, {{and one of the}} U-boat's diesel engines was restored to operating condition and used on the training ship Assen.|$|E
5|$|Gilkeson {{resided in}} Romney for the {{majority}} of his life and was involved in most of the community's organizations <b>as</b> <b>either</b> <b>a</b> leader, officer, or stockholder. Gilkeson's son Henry Bell Gilkeson, Jr., died on November 16, 1901, from injuries sustained by falling against a piece of sharp iron, which penetrated his stomach. Gilkeson's wife, Mary Katherine, predeceased him in February 1910 following the effects of a surgical procedure she had undergone in Cumberland, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|In 1456 Reginald de Gray, {{the owner}} of the Manor itself, sold the land to a group {{including}} Thomas Bryan. A few months later, the other members signed deeds of release, granting the property solely to Thomas Bryan. Bryan acted <b>as</b> <b>either</b> <b>a</b> feoffee or an owner representing the governing body of the Inn (there are some records suggesting he may have been a Bencher at this point) but in 1493 he transferred the ownership by charter to a group including Sir Robert Brudenell and Thomas Wodeward, reverting the ownership of the Inn partially back to the Gray family.|$|E

5|$|LIFE, {{short for}} Laser Inertial Fusion Energy, was a fusion energy effort run at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory between 2008 and 2013. LIFE {{aimed to develop}} the {{technologies}} necessary to convert the laser-driven inertial confinement fusion concept being developed in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) into a practical commercial power plant, a concept known generally as inertial fusion energy (IFE). Two designs were considered, operated <b>as</b> <b>either</b> <b>a</b> pure fusion or hybrid fusion-fission system. LIFE used the same basic concepts as NIF, but aimed to lower costs using mass-produced fuel elements, simplified maintenance, and diode lasers with higher electrical efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Like several {{installments}} in the series, Final Fantasy Tactics {{features a}} character class system, which allows players to customize characters into various roles. The game makes {{extensive use of}} most of the original character classes seen in earlier Final Fantasy games, including Summoners, Wizards (Black Mages), Priests (White Mages), Monks, Lancers (Dragoons), and Thieves. New recruits start out <b>as</b> <b>either</b> <b>a</b> Squire or a Chemist, the base classes for warrior and magician jobs, respectively. The game features twenty jobs accessible by normal characters.|$|E

5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. Research is limited by its short half-life, which prevents the creation of weighable quantities. A visible piece of astatine would immediately vaporize itself because of the heat generated by its intense radioactivity. It {{remains to be seen}} if, with sufficient cooling, a macroscopic quantity of astatine could be deposited as a thin film. Astatine is usually classified <b>as</b> <b>either</b> <b>a</b> nonmetal or a metalloid; metal formation has also been predicted.|$|E
5|$|The willie wagtail is insectivorous {{and spends}} much time chasing prey in open habitat. Its common name {{is derived from}} its habit of wagging its tail {{horizontally}} when foraging on the ground. Aggressive and territorial, the willie wagtail will often harass much larger birds such as the laughing kookaburra and wedge-tailed eagle. It has responded well to human alteration of the landscape and is a common sight in urban lawns, parks, and gardens. It was widely featured in Aboriginal folklore around the country <b>as</b> <b>either</b> <b>a</b> bringer of bad news or a stealer of secrets.|$|E
