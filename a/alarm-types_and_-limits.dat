40|$|Functions Virtualisation (NFV) and Software Driven Networks (SDN) {{aggregate}} resources {{across multiple}} domains. This puts requirements on understanding the overall alarm status across these domains and dependencies between them. Current practice of low-quality alarm documentation and confusion around fundamental concepts like alarm states, <b>alarm-types</b> <b>and</b> the underlying protocols like syslog and SNMP traps {{makes it hard}} to create one unified alarm interface as part of the SDN API. If alarm interfaces for the various components were expressed in a more formal manner including dependencies and propagation between the alarms the NFV/SDN interface could automatically present an integrated alarm API as well as a synthesized alarm state across the virtualized functions. We present a novel approach to alarm interfaces by providing a formal alarm model together with a domain-specific language that allows us to specify both the alarm models and the constraints placed on the alarm models in a consistent manner. This means that we can verify the consistency of an alarm interfaces and automatically generate interfaces, multi-domain correlation and aggregated states. Godkänd; 2014; 20140110 (stewal...|$|R

40|$|Plants that constitutively express {{otherwise}} inducible {{disease resistance}} traits often suffer a depressed seed yield {{in the absence}} of a challenge by pathogens. This has led to the view that inducible disease resistance is indispensable, ensuring that minimal resources are diverted from growth, reproduction and abiotic stress tolerance. The Arabidopsis genotype C 24 has enhanced basal resistance, which was shown to be caused by permanent expression of normally inducible salicylic acid (SA) -regulated defences. However, the seed yield of C 24 was greatly enhanced in comparison to disease-resistant mutants that display identical expression of SA defences. Under both water-replete <b>and</b> <b>-limited</b> conditions, C 24 showed no difference and increased seed yield, respectively, in comparison with pathogen-susceptible genotypes. C 24 was the most drought-tolerant genotype and showed elevated water productivity, defined as seed yield per plant per millilitre water consumed, and achieved this by displaying adjustments to both its development and transpiration efficiency (TE). Therefore, constitutive high levels of disease resistance in C 24 do not affect drought tolerance, seed yield and seed viability. This study demonstrates that it will be possible to combine traits that elevate basal disease resistance and improve water productivity in crop species, and such traits need not be mutually exclusive. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R

Among the genes highly upregulated during symbiosis, we identified—besides the nif gene cluster—an operon encoding a potential cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase (Bphy_ 3646 - 49). Bean root nodules induced by a cyoB mutant strain showed reduced nitrogenase and nitrogen fixation abilities, suggesting an important role of the cytochrome for respiration inside the nodule.

40|$|Although many haloarchaea produce {{biodegradable}} polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), {{the genes}} involved in PHA synthesis {{in the domain}} of Archaea have not yet been experimentally investigated yet. In this study, we revealed that Haloarcula marismortui was able to accumulate poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) up to 21 % of cellular dry weight when cultured in a minimal medium with excessive glucose and identified the phaEHm and phaCHm genes, probably encoding two subunits of a class III PHA synthase. These two genes were adjacent and directed by a single promoter located 26 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site and were constitutively expressed under both nutrient-rich <b>and</b> <b>-limited</b> conditions. Interestingly, PhaCHm was revealed to be strongly bound with the PHB granules, but PhaEHm seemed not to be. Introduction of either the phaEHm or phaCHm gene into Haloarcula hispanica, which harbors highly homologous phaECHh genes, could enhance the PHB synthesis in the recombinant strains, while coexpression of the both genes always generated the highest PHB yield. Significantly, knockout of the phaECHh genes in H. hispanica led to a complete loss of the PHA synthase activity. Complementation with phaECHm genes, but not a single one, restored the capability of PHB accumulation as well as the PHA synthase activity in this phaEC-deleted haloarchaeon. These results indicated that the phaEC genes are required for biosynthesis of PHB and might encode an active PHA synthase in the Haloarcula species...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} iron {{limitation}} on photoacclimation to a dynamic light regime were studied in Phaeocystis antarctica. Batch cultures were grown under a sinusoidal light regime, mimicking vertical mixing, under both iron-sufficient <b>and</b> <b>-limiting</b> conditions. Iron-replete cells responded {{to changes in}} light intensity by rapid xanthophyll cycling. Maximum irradiance coincided with maximum ratios of diatoxanthin/diadinoxanthin (dt/dd). The maximum quantum yield of photosynthesis (F-v /F-m) was negatively related to both irradiance and dt/dd. Full recovery of F-v /F-m {{by the end of}} the light period suggested successful photoacclimation. Iron-limited cells displayed characteristics of high light acclimation. The ratio of xanthophyll pigments to chlorophyll a was three times higher compared to iron-replete cells. Down-regulation of photosynthetic activity was moderated. It is argued that under iron limitation cells maintain a permanent state of high energy quenching to avoid photoinhibition during exposure to high irradiance. Iron-limited cells could maintain a high growth potential due to an increased absorption capacity as recorded by in vivo absorption, which balanced a decrease in F-v/F-m. The increase in the chlorophyll a-specific absorption cross section was related to an increase in carotenoid pigments and a reduction in the package effect. These experiments show that P. antarctica can acclimate successfully to conditions as they prevail in the Antarctic ocean, which may explain the success of this species...|$|R

At high dilution rates (D greater than 0. 25 h- 1), protease activities were greatest under excess glucose conditions. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of chemostat culture effluents showed the presence of up to 18 bands of protease activity at low dilution rates, with apparent molecular masses ranging from about 36 to 125 kDa. High-performance liquid chromatography gel filtration of culture supernatants gave four peaks of activity at 34, 42, 60, and 102 kDa.

Nevertheless, assimilation of dissolved nitrogen under nitrogen-replete <b>and</b> <b>-limited</b> conditions is not well understood in this ecologically important species. In this study, the complete amino acid sequences for three functional genes involved in nitrogen metabolism in E. huxleyi were identified: a putative formamidase, a glutamine synthetase (GSII family), and assimilatory nitrate reductase. Expression patterns of the three enzymes in cells grown on inorganic as well as organic nitrogen sources indicated reduced expression levels of nitrate reductase when cells were grown on NH(4) + and a reduced expression level of the putative formamidase when growth was on NO(3) -. The data reported here suggest the presence of a nitrogen preference hierarchy in E. huxleyi. In addition, the gene encoding for a phosphate repressible phosphate permease was more highly expressed in cells growing on formamide than in cells growing on inorganic nitrogen sources. This finding suggests a coupling between phosphate and nitrogen metabolism, which might give this species a competitive advantage in nutrient-depleted environments.

The problem of finding minimal programs consistent with finite or infinite input-output lists {{is a special}} case (for infinite input-output lists, this is a variant of E. M.

Although most program minimization problems are not recursively solvable, they {{are found to be}} no more difficult than the problem of deciding whether any given program realizes any given description, or the problem of enumerating programs in order of nondecreasing length (whichever is harder). This result is formulated in terms of k-limiting recursive predicates and functionals, defined by repeated application of Gold's limit operator. A simple consequence is that the program minimization problem is limiting recursively solvable for finite input-output lists <b>and</b> 2 <b>-limiting</b> recursively solvable for infinite input-output lists, with weak assumptions about the measure of program size.

The upregulation of isocitrate lyase (ICL) and acylating glyoxylate dehydrogenase (AGODH) led to the enhanced synthesis of oxalate, a dicarboxylic acid involved in the immobilization of aluminum (Al).

The proposed model generalises Schoenberg’s guide-lines in order to make them applicable for more use cases. Instead of modelling his rules directly (as con-straints on scale degree intervals between chord roots), we actually model his explanation of these rules (as constraints between chord pitch class sets and roots, e. g., whether the root pitch class of some chord is an element in the pitch class set of another chord).

Different EAE models facilitate investigation of different pathogeneticaspects of autoimmune neuroinflammation which may have relevance for its human counterpart. Some strains of rats, for instance Lewis rats upon active immunization with whole guinea pig spinalcord in complete Freund's adjuvant exhibit a monophasic EAE, with brief neurological deficits as aresult of neuroinflammation with no or sparse demyelination. DA rats manifest a severe relapsing-remitting type of EAE (SPR-EAE) with extensive demyelination. The present study aimed to delineatethe immunoregulatory factors responsible for self-limiting autoimmunity versus factors involved inchronic autoaggressive tissue destruction. Our hypothesis was that cytokines produced byimmunocompetent cells might be involved in shaping the outcome of immune responses and thusmight play a decisive role in autoimmunity. We investigated how cytokines in the peripheral lymphoidsystem and in the CNS can influence the type of autoimmune attack and clinical manifestations of thedisease. In acute monophasic EAE in Lewis rats, we identified an ordered appearance of putative disease-promoting <b>and</b> <b>-limiting</b> cytokines in the CNS; (i) IL- 12, TNF-beta, IL-lbeta and cytolysin appeared earlyand before onset of clinical signs of EAE, (ii) IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-lbeta peaked at height of clinicalsigns of EAE, (iii) TGF-beta appeared shortly before onset and during clinical recovery, IL- 10 elevatedsignificantly during recovery phase. However, in SPR-EAE in the DA strain, the cytokine pattern wasdistinctly {{different from that of}} M-EAE in Lewis rats. We observed (i) IL- 12, TNF-beta, IL- 1 beta, IFN-gamma,TNF-alpha and cytolysin before and during first attack. These cytokines were long-lasting and wereelevated even during second and third attacks, (ii) TGF-beta, IL- 10 and IL- 4 were undetectable orpresent in minute levels. Our results suggest (1) a disease-promoting role for proinflammatorycytokines (IL- 12, TNF-beta, IL-lbeta, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and cytolysin), in initiation and effector phases ofautoaggressive neuroinflammation in both strains, (2) a disease-limiting role for TGF-beta and IL- 10 inM-EAE, which implicates that these immunodownmodulatory cytokines are associated with diseaserecovery in monophasic EAE in LEW rats, (3) the MS-like protracted and relapsing EAE in DA rats isassociated with a genetically determined prolonged production of proinflammatory cytokines and/orabsence of immunodownmodulatory cytokines. Thus, the balance in cytokine profile might be crucialfor determining if an autoimmune reaction will be noxious. We were further interested in investigating how MHC genes influence susceptibility to MBP-peptideinduced EAE by affecting polarization of T cells, cytokine production and thus the quality of immuneresponse. We immunized Lewis congenics (Lewis background genome, different MHC haplotypes) and Lewis intra-MHC recombinants strains with MBP 63 - 88, 89 - 101 and 87 - 110 peptides. Ourobservations revealed the following: (1) MHC-control of EAE is peptide-specific, (2) the MBP 87 - 110 peptide contains a major MHC associated encephalitogenic peptide in rat, (3) MHC class IIcontrol of EAE-permissiveness is associated with induction of Thl type immune responsesindicated by IFN-gamma production, (4) Both MHC class I and class II exert protective influences onEAE development by production of MHC class I dependent TGF-beta and MHC class II dependent IL- 4 and IL- 10, (5) the protective influence of MHC class I and class II is peptide-specific and isdependent on recognition of certain combinations of MHC-MBP peptide.

40|$|Objectives: Phenothiazines {{have been}} shown to exhibit in vitro and in vivo {{activity}} against Mycobacterium tu-berculosis (Mtb) and multidrug-resistant Mtb. They are predicted to target the genetically validated respiratory chain component type II NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Ndh). Using a set of compounds containing the phenothiazine pharmacophore, we have (i) investigated whether chemical validation data support the molecu-lar target and (ii) evaluated pharmacophore tractability for further drug development. Methods: Recombinant Mtb Ndh was generated and its functionality confirmed by steady-state kinetics. Phar-macodynamic profiling of the phenothiazines, including antitubercular efficacy in aerobic <b>and</b> O 2 <b>-limited</b> con-ditions, time–kill assays and isobole analyses against first-line antituberculars, was performed. Potential mitochondrial toxicity was assessed in a modified HepG 2 cell-line assay and against bovine cytochrome bc 1. Results: Steady-state kinetic analyses revealed a substrate preference for coenzyme Q 2 and an inability to utilize NADPH. A positive correlation between recombinant Ndh inhibition and kill of aerobically cultured Mtb was observed, whilst enhanced potency was demonstrated in a hypoxic model. Time–kill studies revealed the phenothiazines to be bactericidal whilst isobolograms exposed antagonism with isoniazid, indicative of intracellular NADH/NAD+ couple perturbation. At therapeutic levels, phenothiazine-mediated toxicity was appreciable; however, specific mitochondrial targeting was excluded...|$|R
40|$|Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative {{agent of}} tuberculosis, {{possesses}} a class Ib ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), encoded by the nrdE and nrdF 2 genes, {{in addition to}} a putative class II RNR, encoded by nrdZ. In this study we probed the relative contributions of these RNRs to the growth and persistence of M. tuberculosis. We found that targeted knockout of the nrdF 2 gene could be achieved only {{in the presence of a}} complementing allele, confirming that this gene is essential under normal, in vitro growth conditions. This observation also implied that the alternate class Ib small subunit encoded by the nrdF 1 gene is unable to substitute for nrdF 2 and that the class II RNR, NrdZ, cannot substitute for the class Ib enzyme, NrdEF 2. Conversely, a �nrdZ null mutant of M. tuberculosis was readily obtained by allelic exchange mutagenesis. Quantification of levels of nrdE, nrdF 2, nrdF 1, and nrdZ gene expression by real-time, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR with molecular beacons by using mRNA from aerobic <b>and</b> O 2 <b>-limited</b> cultures showed that nrdZ was significantly induced under microaerophilic conditions, in contrast to the other genes, whose expression was reduced by O 2 restriction. However, survival of the �nrdZ mutant strain was not impaired under hypoxic conditions in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Short-term {{effects of}} water deficit on {{nitrogenase}} activity were investigated with hydroponically grown soybean plants (Glycine max L. Merr. cv. Biloxi) by adding polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the hydroponic solution and measuring nitrogenase activity, nodule respiration, and permeability to oxygen diffusion (PJ. These experiments showed a rapid decrease in acety-lene reduction activity {ARA) and nodule respiration. A {{consequence of the}} decreased respiration rate was that Po calculated by Fick's Law also decreased. However, these results following PEG treatment were in direct conflict with a previous report of stability in Po determined by using an alternative technique. To resolve this conflict, an hypothesis describing a sequence of responses to the initial PEG treatment is presented. An important {{finding of this study}} was that the response to water deficit induced by PEG occurred in two stages. The first stage of decreased nodule activity was O 2 <b>-limited</b> <b>and</b> could be reversed by expos-ing the nodules to elevated pO 2. The second stage which developed after 24 h of exposure to PEG resulted in substantial loss in nodule activity and this activity could not be recovered with increased pO 2. Severe water deficit treatments disrupt nodule activity {{to such a degree that}} 02 is no longer the major limitation...|$|R
