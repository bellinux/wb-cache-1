5|$|As Steinhauer {{noted in}} his autobiography, the UK was a {{dangerous}} environment for a foreign agent. Only five years previously, the country {{had not had a}} dedicated counter-espionage organisation. In 1909 a series of spy scares fanned by the press led to the establishment of the Secret Service Bureau, jointly headed by Captain Vernon Kell and Lieutenant-Commander Mansfield Cumming. They soon split their responsibilities; Kell took charge of counter-espionage, while Cumming focused on foreign intelligence. These two divisions of the Secret Service Bureau eventually became two independent intelligence agencies, MI5 and MI6. The Bureau quickly identified a list of possible German agents in the UK. Just before the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, Chief Constables across Britain and Ireland were instructed to arrest suspects in their areas. This was done quickly and a number of German agents were caught, crippling German intelligence operations in the UK <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> moment in the war. Steinhauer himself had been lucky to escape arrest; he was known by name to the British authorities and he had been spying on the Royal Navy in Scotland as recently as late June 1914.|$|E
5|$|Carlisle {{selected}} William Ralls Morrison, another tariff reformer, to {{lead the}} Ways and Means committee, but allowed Randall {{to take charge of}} Appropriations. Morrison's committee produced a bill proposing tariff reductions of 20%; Randall opposed the idea from the start, as did the Republicans. Another bout of illness kept Randall away from Congress <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> time in April 1884, and the tariff bill passed a procedural hurdle by just two votes. Two days later, Randall's Appropriations committee reported several funding bills with his support. Many Democrats who had voted for Morrison's tariff were thereby reminded that Randall had the power to defeat spending that was important to them; when the final vote came, enough switched sides to join with Republicans in defeating the reform 156 to 151.|$|E
5|$|Feyenoord {{were the}} next to feel the wrath of United in a {{back-to-back}} fixture. A penalty from Irwin in the home tie helped ensure the Mancunians would increase their tally to nine points, and a hat-trick from Andy Cole in Rotterdam helped maintain their 100% record in the group stage. However, the game was marred by a high tackle on defender Denis Irwin by Feyenoord midfielder Paul Bosvelt (leaving the Irish international six weeks out <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> stage {{of the season and}} causing something of a media frenzy back in Britain) and constant clashes between both sets of fans. Nevertheless, United were placed as favourites for the competition, largely due to their impressive start, and a routine 3–0 win at home to Košice all but ensured qualification to the knockout stage. Filippo Inzaghi's late header ended United's unbeaten streak in Europe in their last match away to Juventus, but United qualified as group winners nonetheless.|$|E

5|$|On {{the tour}} of South Africa, MCC were led by Frank Mann. Gilligan was {{appointed}} as vice-captain in preference to Percy Fender, who was much admired as a captain but not popular with the cricket authorities. Gilligan played {{in two of the}} five Tests, the first and last. His Test debut came on 23 December 1922 in a match which England lost. The team were more successful during his second appearance; he took six wickets in the match, and his batting <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> stage of the match—he scored 39 not out in the second innings—was vital in a victory which gave the series to England 2–1. In total, Gilligan took nine Test wickets at 22.37, and in all first-class games, captured 26 wickets at an average of 22.03.|$|E
5|$|The {{world of}} Human Revolution was {{designed}} to parallel the Greek myth of Icarus; in the myth, Icarus was flying with artificial wings, but flew {{too close to the}} sun and destroyed his wings, causing his fatal fall. The world's new reliance on and experimentation with augmentation technology mirrored the myth, with the game's narrative taking place <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> tipping point, the outcome of which would be decided by the player. The general focus on technology and its effect on human society also tied into the game's visual themes. The development team used multiple sources as references while creating the world and scenario. The Children of Men was used to capture the setting and resultant chaotic drama, Bioshock gave them a reference for the handling of mature themes, while the television series Rome showed how powerful people's ambitions shaped history. The sense of tension between augmented and normal humans was inspired by the similar tension between humans and mutants in the X-Men franchise. For the conspiracy elements of the plot, the team used novels Deception Point, The Firm, and Frank Herbert's Dune saga as inspiration. The desired quality of cutscenes and dialogue were directly inspired by the Grand Theft Auto and Mass Effect franchises. DeMarle termed the final product as a study in contrasts, as the implementation of augmentation technology had created a new form of divided social class system when other social barriers had fallen. Other themes used earlier in Deus Ex, such as exploring a culture of fear; the workings of a surveillance state; and the exploitation created by economic inequality, were paralleled in Human Revolution. To add more depth to the world and narrative, the team created supplementary written material such as emails, e-books, and cell phone-like devices called pocket secretaries.|$|E

50|$|It {{is unknown}} the exact date when Stanley started to draw and paint but he almost {{certainly}} went to Mary Swanwick Secondary School only 200 yards away in Old Whittington. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> very <b>crucial</b> age, he gained {{confidence in his}} own natural talent and abilities and {{as with so many}} people at that time, his war experience considerably expanded Stanley’s horizons.|$|R
40|$|Prairie Dog Empire {{provides}} a semitechnical overview on what some ecologists {{refer to as}} the Prairie Dog Ecosystem, focused on black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) and their associated vertebrate species. Given the controversy surrounding management of prairie dogs, it is surprising that such a volume has not been published previously.

25|$|Wiranto's {{appointment}} as Commander of ABRI in February 1998 came <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> time.

In Suharto's new Cabinet, Wiranto was named as the Minister of Defense and Security.|$|E
50|$|The {{monument}} commemorates Napoleon's defeat <b>at</b> Leipzig, <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> {{step towards}} the end of hostilities in the War of the Sixth Coalition, which was seen as a victory for the German people, although Germany as it is known today did not begin to exist until 1870. There were German speakers fighting on both sides, as Napoleon's troops also included conscripted Germans from the French-occupied left bank of the Rhine {{as well as from the}} Confederation of the Rhine.|$|R

25|$|The Battle of Lützen (November 6, 1632) {{was one of}} {{the most}} decisive battles of the Thirty Years' War.

25|$|Curiously, {{though the}} opening {{promises}} {{a journey of}} self-discovery, the premise of each episode is that Bronson enters someone else's life <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> point and acts {{as a catalyst for}} change. When Bronson encounters an Amish community, for example, a local boy becomes enraptured by the outside world and steals Bronson's motorcycle to run off to Reno, Nevada. In another episode, located in Reno, Nevada, Bronson meets his cousin Eve on her wedding day and lends her money for the wedding service, but she runs off to the casinos and gambles it away.|$|E

Youth unemployment is <b>at</b> present <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> issue in the EU policy agenda...|$|R
50|$|The naval {{order of}} 24 October 1918 and the {{preparations}} to sail triggered a mutiny among the affected sailors. The revolt soon precipitated a general revolution in Germany that would sweep aside the monarchy {{within a few}} days. The mutinous sailors {{had no intention of}} risking their lives so close {{to the end of the}} war. They were also convinced that the credibility of the new democratic government, engaged as it was in seeking an armistice with the victorious Entente, would have been compromised by <b>a</b> naval attack <b>at</b> such <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> point in negotiations.|$|R
25|$|Reith also {{frequently}} references {{in his autobiography}} departmental jealousies resulting from his ministerial activities, reported to him by colleagues such as Sir John Anderson, wartime Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Churchill coalition. Complaints to the latter from fellow ministers and MPs {{would appear to be}} the more likely cause of his fall. This came <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> stage in Reith's career. After the outbreak of war, several major figures had told Reith that he would soon join the War Cabinet itself, not least Beaverbrook, one of the Prime Minister's closest associates.|$|E
