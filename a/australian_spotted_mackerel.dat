50|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomberomorus munroi) is {{a species}} of fish in the family Scombridae. Common fork length ranges between 50 and 80 cm. Specimens have been {{recorded}} at up to 104 cm in length, and weighing up to 10.2 kg. It {{is found in the}} western Pacific, along the northern coast of Australia, from the Abrolhos Islands region of Western Australia to Coffs Harbour and Kempsey in central New South Wales. It is also found in southern Papua New Guinea from Kerema to Port Moresby. It feeds largely on fishes, particularly anchovies and sardines, with smaller quantities of shrimps and squids. It is sometimes confused with Japanese Spanish mackerel, S. niphonius. Conservation status of the species has not yet been evaluated by the IUCN.|$|E

40|$|Cardicola Short, 1953 is a genus of the Aporocotylidae Odhner, 1912 (Digenea), with 25 {{currently}} recognised species described from 32 {{species of}} Perciformes and Mugiliformes fishes around the world, including eight species from the Great Barrier Reef. Here, we describe two new species from this region, namely Cardicola beveridgei n. sp. from the ventricle and atrium of the mangrove jack, Lutjanus argentimaculatus (Forsskål) (Perciformes: Lutjanidae), and Cardicola bullardi n. sp. from the ventricle of the <b>Australian</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Scomberomorus munroi Collette & Russo (Perciformes: Scombridae), from off Lizard Island, Queensland, Australia. These two new species are most easily {{distinguished from the}} 25 current members of Cardicola in having the combination of i) a spinous oral sucker, ii) an anteriorly intercaecal ovary, iii) a uterus that extends anteriorly from the oötype, iv) the number of spines per ventrolateral transverse row, and in v) body size and the length/width ratio, vi) the oesophagus and caecal length(s) relative to body total length, vii) {{the length of the}} posterior caeca relative to the anterior pair, viii) the testis length/width ratio and its total size relative to that of the body, ix) the postovarian field as a percentage of body length, and x) egg size. In addition, C. beveridgei n. sp. is further differentiated by possessing a female genital pore that opens anterodextral to the male pore while C. bullardi n. sp. differs further in possessing a testis that is almost entirely intercaecal and does not extend anteriorly {{to the level of the}} intestinal bifurcation. Employing genetic analysis of ITS 2 rDNA sequence data, representing these species and a further 13 recognised and three putative species of Cardicola, we were able to unequivocally confirm these specimens as distinct (9 - 22 % different over 420 nucleotide positions). Distance analysis of ITS 2 showed that i) species of Cardicola from the Siganidae formed a monophyletic clade, to the exclusion of other Cardicola species reported from the Scombridae, Sparidae, Lutjanidae and Chaetodontidae, ii) a general phylogenetic isolation exists between the species of Cardicola reported from scombrid fishes, and iii) C. beveridgei n. sp. and Cardicola milleri Nolan & Cribb, 2006 from lutjanids and Cardicola chaetodontis Yamaguti, 1970 from chaetodontids are phylogenetically close, despite the evolutionary remoteness between the host groups and their highly disparate biology. Given the likelihood of many additional species being attributed to Cardicola, we predict that continued molecular analyses will indicate that this genus will prove to incorporate a series of radiations in association with particular fish taxa as well as evidence of host-switching.

40|$|Even {{when the}} fishing {{is carried out}} under the {{constant}} fishing effort, catch fluctuates largely. Its fluctuation depends on two main factors, i. e. phychophysiological phase of fish and the fish population size in the fishing ground. To clarify these factors, {{the analysis of the}} catch fluctuation is needed. By use of Auto-correlation Coefficient, the authors carried out the analysis of periodic fluctuation of the catch of <b>spotted</b> <b>mackerel</b> in the fishing ground off the Yaku Island in Kagoshima Prefecture. In this study, it was clarified that when the number of the catch per one operation is less than 25 fish, the catch depends mainly on the chance, and when it is over 25 fish, the catch depends on the fishing ability of the crew, which is fixed by the experience and the strength of the crew. Then, in this analysis, the authors used the catch-data obtained in 1971 and 1972, and of the crew who showed an average catch irrespective of the catch per one operation, and who was looked upon as the one with much experience and full strength. Moreover as the catch was supposed to be affected by the winds and waves because of the smallness of the fishing boat, the fluctuation of the scale of wind waves in the fishing ground was analyzed. The following results were obtained. (1). In the wind waves fluctuation, significant cycles consisting of 3. 4 days, 5. 2 days and 32. 7 days were observed in 1972. (2) ．In the catch fluctuation, significant cycles consisting of 3. 8 days and 8. 8 days were observed in 1971; and those of 5. 1 days and 9. 6 days in 1972; and the former in 1972 was considered to be the cycle affected by the wind waves. (3). No cycle agree with that of the moon-age was observed in the catch fluctuation. (4). It was assumed that the periodic fluctuation of catch is to be caused chiefly by both emigration and the immigration of the <b>spotted</b> <b>mackerel</b> in the fishing ground round the Yaku Island. ...|$|R

40|$|Viscera of {{mackerel}} (Scomber sp.) were defatted by supercritical {{carbon dioxide}} (SCO 2) treatment. Trypsin (SC-T) was then extracted from the defatted powder and purified {{by a series of}} chromatographies including Sephacryl S- 200 and Sephadex G- 50. The purified SC-T was nearly homogeneous on SDS-PAGE, and its molecular weight was estimated as approximately 24, 000 [*]Da. N-terminal twenty amino acids sequence of SC-T was IVGGYECTAHSQPHQVSLNS. The specific trypsin inhibitors, soybean trypsin inhibitor and TLCK, strongly inhibited the activities of SC-T. The pH and temperature optimums of SC-T were at around pH 8. 0 and 60 ∘C, respectively, using Nα-p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester as a substrate. The SC-T was unstable below pH 5. 0 and above 40 ∘C, and it was stabilized by calcium ion. These enzymatic characteristics of SC-T were the same as those of other fish trypsins, especially <b>spotted</b> <b>mackerel</b> (S. borealis) trypsin, purified from viscera defatted by acetone.

40|$|Scattered chum bait is very {{available}} in line fishing, {{and it has}} been defined as the bait to be scattered at the fishing spot to attract the fishes from far to come close to the spot. And up to now only the attracting effect of this bait has been discussed by many fisheries biologists. But the significant effectiveness of the scattered chum bait in line fishing can not be considered to depend only on the attracting factor. The author carried out the tank experiments on the reaction of fish to the extract of food to find out how the scattered chum bait allures fish to the fishing bait sewed to a hook. The results are summarized as follows: 1. The fishes used, <b>spotted</b> <b>mackerel,</b> perch and sweep lips, showed avoiding reaction to the colored sea water introduced into the experimental tank. On the otherhand, when these fishes were exposed to the extract of food, their swimming became very active, and they disrupted the schooling, showing a feeding frenzy. 2. The clear social facilitation was observed in the reaction of <b>spotted</b> <b>mackerel</b> to the extract of food, i. e. the respons of a group of 5 individuals was most active than the other groups of less individuals, when an individual was kept solitary in a tank there was no positive reaction to the extract of food. 3. When in a feeding frenzy these three fishes indiscriminately tried to take any small inedible objects in the water or at the water surface. 4. Furthermore when the sweep lips was exposed to the extract of food, it actively picked the bottom board of the tank even though there was no object on the board. This remarkable behavior was also observed in other bottom fishes in an aquarium. And so the reaction of fish to an extract of food is considered to have close relationship with its feeding habit. 5. From these observations it is concluded that the scattered chum bait evokes very active feeding behavior of fishes; an reaction of an individual enhances that of the schooling companions; the success of line fishing and pole-and-line fishing depends on this activity. When in such a state fishes indiscriminately take any small object in the water and thus are vulnerable to line fishing and pole-and-line fishing. ...|$|R
