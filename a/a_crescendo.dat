5|$|The Ramlila of Ramnagar is a {{dramatic}} enactment of Rama's legend, as told in Ramacharitamanasa. The plays, sponsored by Kashi Naresh, are performed in Ramnagar every evening for 31 days. On the last day, the festivities reach <b>a</b> <b>crescendo</b> as Rama vanquishes the demon king Ravana. Kashi Naresh Udit Narayan Singh started this tradition around 1830.|$|E
5|$|Musical accompaniment for {{the silent}} films were not {{provided}} by the studios, and the Thanhouser productions were no exception. The musical program for the screenings were decided and played by the individual accompanists. At times, musical accompaniments were shared in trade journals and the musical accompaniment for Adrift was provided by an unnamed writer from Oklahoma in The Moving Picture World. The suggestion was {{to begin with a}} waltz until the friend pats the artist on the shoulder, when All I Get is Sympathy is played. The suggestion for I Don't Know Where I'm Going completes the scene and Life's A Funny Proposition follows the artist packing up until the artist pulls out the gun. A soft hurry follows as the girl confronts her father, leading to <b>a</b> <b>crescendo</b> at the climax.|$|E
5|$|Political {{activism}} in the Rhondda {{has a deep}} link with trade unions and the socialist movement but was initially slow to develop. In the 1870s the Amalgamated Association of Miners won support, but was destroyed by employer hostility. The Cambrian Miners’ Association was more successful {{and the creation of}} the South Wales Miners' Federation after the 1898 coal strike, gave the South Wales miners a reputation for militancy, in which the Rhondda Valley played its part. As part of the Redistribution Act of 1885 the Rhondda was granted its first seat in Parliament which was won by the moderate trade union leader William Abraham, who was notably the only working-class member elected in Wales. Socialism and syndicalism ideals grew throughout the 20th century and industrial struggle reached <b>a</b> <b>crescendo</b> in the 1910-11 Tonypandy Riots. A year later Tonypandy saw the publication of Noah Ablett’s pamphlet The Miners' Next Step. Tonypandy was at the centre of further public disorder when, on 11 June 1936 at Dewinton Field, a large group of people gathered to confront the open-air address by Tommy Moran, propaganda officer of the British Union of Fascists. The crowd, recorded as between 2,000 and 6,000 strong, turned violent and police were forced to protect Moran's Blackshirt bodyguard. Seven local people were arrested.|$|E

25|$|Bowen's writing style {{frequently}} {{involves a}} slow pace that builds to <b>a</b> <b>crescendo,</b> and a usage of free indirect discourse and stream of consciousness. While {{in many of}} Bowen's novels modernism and realism mix, and sometimes clash, The House in Paris is usually characterised as modernist.|$|E
25|$|His Cello Concerto, {{dedicated}} to Siegfried Palm (1966) contains two movements. The first movement {{begins with an}} almost imperceptible cello which slowly shifts into static tone clusters with the orchestra before reaching <b>a</b> <b>crescendo</b> and slowly decaying. The second movement is a virtuoso piece of dynamic atonal melody {{on the part of}} the cello.|$|E
25|$|The {{result was}} the GL/EF, for Gun Laying/Elevation Finder, {{although}} known almost universally as the Bedford Attachment. This modification added a set of vertical antennas and a new elevation-measuring CRT to read them, along with a radiogoniometer that allowed the vertical angle to be accurately measured. Mk. I*'s with GL/EF began to deploy in early 1941, just as The Blitz was reaching <b>a</b> <b>crescendo.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Dragon Warrior IV {{was one of}} the few NES {{games to}} feature <b>a</b> <b>crescendo</b> during the battle music, a gradual increase in volume from soft to loud. This technique was rare for an NES game. However, the PlayStation and Nintendo DS versions do not feature the crescendo in the battle music. This level of detail can be found in the NES version's soundtrack, as well as the 2014 Android and iOS mobile releases.|$|E
25|$|With the First Boer War {{reaching}} <b>a</b> <b>crescendo,</b> he {{was once}} again sent back to South Africa in January 1881, initially as a “staff colonel” to Sir George Colley, Governor and Commander-in-Chief in Natal, who was his junior on the Army list. He was then, again with the local rank of brigadier-general, appointed second-in-command, pushing reinforcements up to Colley. He succeeded Colley after his defeat and death at Majuba Hill (27 February 1881), earning promotion to the local rank of major-general.|$|E
25|$|The next {{sequential}} step in an Odissi {{performance is}} Batu, {{also known as}} Battu Nrutya or Sthayee Nrutya or Batuka Bhairava. It is a fast pace, pure dance (nritta) performed in the honor of Shiva. There is no song or recitation accompanying {{this part of the}} dance, just rhythmic music. This pure dance sequence in Odissi builds up to a Pallavi which is often slow, graceful & lyrical movements of the eyes, neck, torso & feet & slowly builds in <b>a</b> <b>crescendo</b> to climax in a fast tempo at the end.|$|E

25|$|As the {{stability}} of the operating system collapsed, the ready answer was that Taligent would fix this—it was fully reentrant, truly multitasking, and made heavy use of protected memory. When the Taligent efforts collapsed, Apple was left with an aging OS and no designated solutions. By 1994 the press buzz surrounding the upcoming release of Windows 95 started to grow to <b>a</b> <b>crescendo,</b> often questioning Apple's ability to respond to the challenge it presented. The press turned on the company, often introducing Apple's new projects as failures in the making.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, World War II brought {{thousands}} of servicemen and war workers to New Orleans {{as well as}} to the surrounding region's military bases and shipyards. Many of these sojourners paid visits to the Vieux Carré. Although nightlife and vice had already begun to coalesce on Bourbon Street in the two decades following the closure of Storyville, the war produced a larger, more permanent presence of exotic, risqué, and often raucous entertainment on what became the city's most famous strip. Years of repeated crackdowns on vice in Bourbon Street clubs, which took on new urgency under Mayor deLesseps Story Morrison, reached <b>a</b> <b>crescendo</b> with District Attorney Jim Garrison's raids in 1962, but Bourbon Street's clubs were soon back in business.|$|E
25|$|Finally, all the {{characters}} of the parade began to walk inside the pool, around its center, mixing {{the past and the}} present in a single marching beat of the drums. The confluence of {{the past and the present}} is another main theme of the opening ceremony. The music began <b>a</b> <b>crescendo</b> with choruses, when all of a sudden an olive tree was lifted from the center of the pool - symbolizing goddess Athena's preferred gift by the Greeks - land and food - over Poseidon's gift, the horse - a tool of warfare. At the music's climax, all {{the characters}} stopped and raised their arms as if worshipping the Tree, which was high above, surrounded also by the fragments of the deconstructed statues who resembled a mount.|$|E

25|$|As the war continued, Confederate {{soldiers}} began, {{in letters}} {{home and to}} their congressmen, to express concerns about {{the performance of the}} office of the Commissary-General. Loyal to his friend, and aware of the overall logistical dilemmas facing the Confederacy, President Davis refrained from making Northrop into a scapegoat. However, logistical problems worsened and reached <b>a</b> <b>crescendo</b> in the supply situation facing the Army of Northern Virginia during the Siege of Petersburg in the winter of 1864-1865. Although Robert E. Lee's army had by this time become absolutely vital to the continued existence of the Confederacy, only two railroad lines (the Richmond & Danville and the Southside Railroad) linked the hungry soldiers with the fertile fields of Southside Virginia, and Northrop's commissary corps was pathetically unable to feed Lee's army.|$|E
25|$|During 2005, Russia claimed Ukraine was {{not paying}} for gas, but {{diverting}} {{that which was}} intended to be exported to the EU from the pipelines. Ukrainian officials at first denied the accusation, but later Naftogaz admitted that natural gas intended for other European countries was retained and used for domestic needs. The dispute reached <b>a</b> <b>crescendo</b> on 1 January 2006, when Russia cut off all gas supplies passing through Ukrainian territory. On 4 January 2006, a preliminary agreement between Russia and Ukraine was achieved, and the supply was restored. The situation calmed until October 2007 when new disputes began over Ukrainian gas debts. This led to reduction of gas supplies in March 2008. During the last months of 2008, relations once again became tense when Ukraine and Russia could not agree on the debts owed by Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|Performers {{then begin}} the main {{compositions}} with a section called raga alapana exploring the raga. In this, {{they use the}} sounds aa, ri, na, ta, etc. instead of swaras to slowly elaborate the notes and flow of the raga. This begins slowly and builds to <b>a</b> <b>crescendo,</b> and finally establishes a complicated exposition of the raga that shows the performer's skill. All of this is done without any rhythmic accompaniment, or beat. Then the melodic accompaniment (violin or veena), expounds the raga. Experienced listeners can identify many ragas after they hear just a few notes. With the raga thus established, the song begins, usually with lyrics. In this, the accompaniment (usually violin, sometimes veena) performs along with the main performer and the percussion (such as a mridangam). In {{the next stage of}} the song, they may sing niraval or kalpanaswaram again.|$|E

500|$|Thurlow {{thought that}} Tyndall's oratorical style was learned from Mosley's example, while Trilling instead {{believed}} that it was based on that of Hitler. According to Trilling, Tyndall's [...] "speeches were pompous but studied... copied the hand gestures, the rising delivery that ended in <b>a</b> <b>crescendo</b> of angry epithets ... But it was flat and tedious, like a provincial PE teacher trying to show his bored pupils how the rugby or football greats might have done it." ...|$|E
500|$|In section C, [...] "" [...] (and if you coldly close {{yourself}} to them, they stiffen), Reger uses word painting, {{by means of}} downward lines and a final decrescendo for the line erstarren sie bis hinein in das Tiefste (they stiffen, up to the deepest). On the word [...] (stiffens), the chorus settles on a dissonant 5-part chord, held for two measures, suddenly fortissimo with <b>a</b> <b>crescendo</b> at the end, then repeated pianissimo, an octave lower, motionless.|$|E

More paper-covered motor vehicles entered. After Churchill finished his speech, people dressed in newspaper print began to fill the arena, ranging from office workers to school children. The beat of the music got faster and noisier, symbolising the London rush hour. [...] As the noise reached <b>a</b> <b>crescendo,</b> Churchill cried out for all to stop, bringing this section to an end.|$|E
