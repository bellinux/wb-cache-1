40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is an autoimmune disease, {{which not}} only affects the joints but can also impact on general well-being and risk for cardiovascular disease. Regular physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> in patients with RA have numerous health benefits. Nevertheless, the majority of patients with RA are physically inactive. This indicates that people with RA might experience additional or more severe barriers to physical <b>activity</b> or <b>exercise</b> than the general population. This narrative review {{provides an overview of}} perceived barriers, benefits and facilitators of physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> in RA. Databases were searched for articles published until September 2014 using the terms ‘rheumatoid arthritis’, ‘physical activity’, ‘exercise’, ‘barriers’, ‘facilitators’, ‘benefits’, ‘motivation’, ‘motivators’ and ‘enablers’. Similarities were found between disease-specific barriers and benefits of physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise,</b> e. g. pain and fatigue are frequently mentioned as barriers, but reductions in pain and fatigue are perceived benefits of physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise.</b> Even though exercise does not influence the existence of barriers, physically active patients appear to be more capable of overcoming them. Therefore, exercise programmes should enhance self-efficacy for exercise in order to achieve long-term physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> behaviour. Encouragement from health professionals and friends/family are facilitators for physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise.</b> There is a need for interventions that support RA patients in overcoming barriers to physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> and help sustain this important health behaviour...|$|R

5000|$|Exercise {{addiction}} {{is a state}} characterized by a compulsive engagement in any form of physical exercise, despite negative consequences. While regular exercise is generally a healthy <b>activity,</b> <b>exercise</b> addiction generally involves performing excessive amounts of exercise {{to the detriment of}} physical health, spending too much time exercising to the detriment of personal and professional life, and exercising regardless of physical injury. [...] It may also involve a state of dependence upon regular exercise which involves the occurrence of severe withdrawal symptoms when the individual is unable to exercise. Differentiating between addictive and healthy exercise behaviors is difficult but there are key factors in determining which category a person may fall into. Exercise addiction shows a high comorbidity with eating disorders.|$|E

Irrational beliefs (mithyatva) are partially suppressed {{in the second and third}} stages, and are fully eliminated in the fourth stage. In stages five and six, non-restraint (avirati) is gradually eliminated in stages.

From the eleventh to the thirteenth all the passions are eliminated and only activity is present. On the last stage, there is no activity, hence no binding of karma.|$|E
50|$|The {{degree of}} {{availability}} of comparison information influenced {{the visibility of}} BFLPEs in different school system structures. The BFLPE was most pronounced in school systems in which students of different ability levels were separated into different school tracks. The German school system is an example. In school systems in which students were grouped by ability within one school, the BFLPE was still present, but increased positive assimilation effects counterbalanced negative contrast effects. In sports psychology, physical self-concept is considered both a valued outcome variable and a mediating variable that facilitates the attainment of other valued outcomes like physical skills, health-related physical fitness, physical <b>activity,</b> <b>exercise</b> adherence in non-elite settings, and improved performance in elite sports. Marsh, Morin, and Parker (2015) demonstrated that the BFLPE exists with regard to physical concept. The study showed that class-average physical ability in physical fitness was negatively associated with physical self-concept.|$|E

40|$|Background: People with {{advanced}} multiple sclerosis (MS) are less physically active {{than those with}} milder forms of the disease, and wheelchair use has a negative association with physical activity participation. Thus, wheelchair users with MS are doubly disadvantaged for accruing the benefits of physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise.</b> Appropriate physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> interventions are needed for this population. Methods: We undertook a qualitative study to explore the meanings, motivations, and outcomes of physical activity in wheelchair users with MS. We sought to understand daily opportunities to accumulate physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise,</b> and to identify perceived barriers, facilitators, and benefits that might inform the design of future interventions. Results: We interviewed 15 wheelchair users (mean age, 52 ± 8. 8 years; n = 12 women). Data were transcribed and analyzed to identify and explore common themes. Our first theme was the reduced {{opportunity to participate in}} physical activity due to participants' dependence on mobility devices, environmental adaptations, and tangible support. Our second theme was the importance of incorporating physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> into the everyday environment, highlighting the need for adaptive exercise and accessible environments. This indicated the need to incorporate behavior change modulators into physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> interventions for those {{with advanced}} MS. Health-care professionals {{played an important role in}} promoting increased physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> participation in those with advanced MS. Conclusions: Our findings may inform future interventions to increase initiation and maintenance of physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> among people with advanced MS...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{systematic}} review {{was conducted to}} provide rich and deep evidence of the perceived determinants and consequences of physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> based on qualitative research in multiple sclerosis (MS). Method: Electronic databases and article reference lists were searched to identify qualitative studies of physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> in MS. Studies were included if they were written in English and examined consequences/determinants of physical activity in persons with MS. Content analysis of perceived determinants and consequences of physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> was undertaken using an inductive analysis guided by the Physical Activity for people with Disabilities framework and Social Cognitive Theory, respectively. Results: Nineteen articles were reviewed. The most commonly identified perceived barriers of physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> {{were related to the}} environmental (i. e. minimal or no disabled facilities, and minimal or conflicting advice from healthcare professionals) and related to personal barriers (i. e. fatigue, and fear and apprehension). The most commonly identified perceived facilitators of physical activity were related to the environment (i. e. the type of exercise modality and peer support) and related to personal facilitators (i. e. appropriate exercise and feelings of accomplishment). The most commonly identified perceived beneficial consequences of physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> were maintaining physical functions, increased social participation and feelings of self-management and control. The most commonly identified perceived adverse consequences were increased fatigue and feelings of frustration and lost control. Conclusions: Results will inform future research on the perceived determinants and consequences of physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> in those with MS and can be adopted for developing professional education and interventions for physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> in MS. Implications for Rehabilitation Physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> behaviour in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) is subject to a number of modifiable determinants. Healthcare professionals working to promote physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> in those with MS should choose to endorse the positive benefits of participation.

50|$|An addiction, by definition, {{includes}} repeated compulsive {{behaviors that}} negatively affect daily living. There {{are two ways}} to classify addictive behaviors: substance addiction and process addiction. An exercise addiction is a type of process addiction, in which an individual's mood toward a certain event becomes dependent on addictive behaviors. Many educational, occupational, and social activities are stopped due to excessive exercising. Depression may develop if exercise is neglected or may result from reoccurring physical injuries that limit exercise. Exercise addiction is often related to obsessive-compulsive disorder as exercise addicts may have obsessions or compulsions toward physical <b>activity.</b> <b>Exercise</b> addiction is also commonly associated with eating disorders as a secondary symptom of bulimia or anorexia nervosa. Approximately 39-48% of people that have an eating disorder are also addicted to exercise. When diagnosing bulimia, exercise addiction is referred to as a compensatory behavior and indicator of the underlying disorder. Research also shows exercise addiction influences not only the development of eating disorders but also their maintenance.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{physical}} <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> is associated with a lower risk of a range of morbidities and all-cause mortality. Further, it appears that risk reductions are greater when physical <b>activity</b> and/or <b>exercise</b> is performed at a higher intensity of effort. Why this may be the case is perhaps explained by the accumulating evidence linking physical fitness and performance outcomes (e. g. cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, and muscle mass) also to morbidity and mortality risk. Current guidelines about the performance of moderate/vigorous physical <b>activity</b> using aerobic <b>exercise</b> modes focuses upon the accumulation of a minimum volume of physical <b>activity</b> and/or <b>exercise,</b> and have thus far produced disappointing outcomes. As such there has been increased interest in the use of higher effort physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> as being potentially more efficacious. Though there is currently debate as to the effectiveness of public health prescription based around higher effort physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise,</b> most discussion around this has focused upon modes considered to be traditionally ‘aerobic’ (e. g. running, cycling, rowing, swimming etc.). A mode customarily performed to a relatively high intensity of effort that we believe has been overlooked is resistance training. Current guidelines do include recommendations to engage in ‘muscle strengthening activities’ though there has been very little emphasis upon these modes in either research or public health effort. As such the purpose of this debate article is to discuss the emerging higher effort paradigm in physical <b>activity</b> and <b>exercise</b> for public health and to make a case for why there should be a greater emphasis placed upon resistance training as a mode in this paradigm shift...|$|R
