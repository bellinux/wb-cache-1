MAIN OUTCOMES <b>AND</b> MEASURES <b>The</b> numbers <b>of</b> psychiatric beds <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> prison populations. RESULTS Since 1990, the numbers of psychiatric beds decreased in all 6 countries (ranging from - 2. 0 % to - 71. 9 %), while <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> prison populations increased substantially (ranging from 16. 1 % to 273. 0 %). Panel data regression analysis across the 6 countries showed a significant inverse relationship between numbers of psychiatric beds and <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> prison populations. On average, the removal of 1 bed was associated with 5. 18 more prisoners (95 % CI, 3. 10 - 7. 26; P =. 001), which was reduced to 2. 78 prisoners (95 % CI, 2. 59 - 2. 97; P <. 001) when economic growth was considered as a covariate.

5|$|Because Guianan {{cocks-of-the-rock}} form large leks, averaging 55 adult males, {{the males}} in these display leks were {{especially vulnerable to}} attacks and predation by large snakes and other natural predators. In manipulated groups of smaller size, around 6, predation was less likely to occur, giving rise to an inverse relationship between the number and frequency of attacks <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> leks. Thus, with a smaller frequency of attacks on the smaller group, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock males was less likely to spook or disperse completely as compared to a large group where a false alarm could trigger a complete flush out 90% of the time. It was found that these birds have relatively ineffective methods of anti-predation and that only social anti-predation and the infrequency of encounters with predators were keeping these lekking males alive.|$|E
5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E

To tackle the problem of statistical non-independence that probably existed among the closely related species, we reconstructed the phylogeny of the species studied using mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA sequences from GenBank. By using the methods adopted in most previous reports, we tested the relationship between song complexity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song control nuclei. We found that: 1) <b>the</b> absolute <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> RA <b>and</b> Area X, but not of HVC, were positively correlated to the three measures of song complexity, but that only <b>the</b> residual <b>size</b> <b>of</b> RA in regard to telencephalon size was significantly correlated to the song measures; 2) independent contrasts analysis showed RA and Area X to be significantly associated with NSLP.

5|$|Camouflage for {{aircraft}} {{is complicated by}} the fact that the aircraft's background varies widely, depending on the location of the observer, the nature of the background and the aircraft's motion. For this reason, military aircraft were often painted to match the sky when viewed from below, and to either match the ground or break up the aircraft's outline when viewed from above. This is a form of countershading, likely to work best on aircraft such as heavy bombers that do not do fly inverted during combat. Because of the way light hits it, patterns of dark and light will often be present on an aircraft even if it is entirely one color, making it easier to see Reflections and specular highlights can be counteracted by painting an aircraft in neutral shades with a non-reflective, matte finish. There is a trade-off between the effectiveness of camouflage <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> recognition markings: larger markings reduce the risk of friendly fire through misrecognition, but compromise camouflage.|$|E
