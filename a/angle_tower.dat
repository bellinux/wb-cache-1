5000|$|The {{ruins of}} a {{fortress}} called by the folk Sokolić rise on Vučjak hill; it has a square ground-plan and one cylindrical <b>angle</b> <b>tower.</b> First mentioned in 1499 as a fortress of the Frankopans, remained a borderline stronghold until the Turks were expelled from Lika. In 1773 already a [...] "completely demolished town".|$|E
50|$|Two of the <b>angle</b> <b>towers</b> are {{decorated}} with paintings of the 16th century (hunting scenes in the north-western tower, religious scenes in the south-eastern tower, where the chapel was).|$|R
5000|$|Charles McKean {{described}} the castle as [...] "a splendid double-courtyard Renaissance chateau" [...] and also said [...] "It {{consisted of a}} four-storey block with circular <b>angle</b> <b>towers</b> and a stair turret".|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after their}} settlement, the castle {{was built on}} an ancient feudal mound (Motte du Plessis) by Lancelot de Boucart. The castle has kept its medieval styled châtelet entrance, outer walls and <b>angled</b> <b>towers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The castle is of {{irregular}} trapezoidal layout with rectangular <b>angle</b> <b>tower.</b> The layout broad side {{is faced}} toward north. It consists of {{center in the}} northern part, and of external fortified yard in the central and southern part. The guard tower is best preserved. It had five floors, preserved to a height of 17 m with irregular layout, 8 m long by 6 m wide.|$|E
50|$|Excavations {{were made}} in 1932-4, and the ditch for the south rampart was traced, as well as Hadrian's Wall, which formed the north face of the fort. Barrack-like {{buildings}} were also found within {{the outline of the}} fort. In 1939 a large granary, lying east to west, was found in extending the local school-yard. In 1940 the south-west <b>angle</b> <b>tower</b> was found as well as the south and east walls.|$|E
5000|$|The castle {{became the}} nucleus of the {{subsequent}} greater country house which was built onto and around it. On the east face of the south-east <b>angle</b> <b>tower</b> was a sundial with the monogram [...] "C.M.E.L" [...] for Charles Maitland & his wife Elizabeth Lauder, the monogram being divided by the date 1664, the year in which Maitland commenced dramatic new extensions to the old castle. His son John added the east front in a Renaissance style in 1696 and 1704. It was restored in 1859 and in 1870 the windows were altered.|$|E
50|$|Roscrea Castle is a 13th-century motte {{castle in}} the town of Roscrea, Ireland. The Castle {{consists}} of a walled courtyard, gate block, and <b>angled</b> <b>towers.</b> Along with 18th century Damer House and gardens, the Castle forms part of Roscrea Heritage Centre.|$|R
50|$|Structures are {{classified}} as tangent suspension, angle suspension, tangent strain, angle strain, tangent dead-end and angle dead-end. Where the conductors are in a straight line, a tangent <b>tower</b> is used. <b>Angle</b> <b>towers</b> are used where a line must change direction.|$|R
50|$|In ancient times, {{the manor}} of Caverswall {{was held by}} the eponymous Caverswall family, who in 1275 were granted licence to crenellate their manor house. The {{resulting}} medieval moated castle was approximately rectangular in plan with four <b>angle</b> <b>towers</b> and a keep within the curtain walls.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The dynamic {{response}} {{analysis of}} a transmission <b>angle</b> <b>tower</b> subjected to wind excitations is actively carried out in this study. The structural model is constructed based on finite element approach with the aiding of commercial package ANSYS. The equation of motion of the transmission tower-line system under wind excitations is established. The dynamic wind loading are applied on the tower-line system to examine the structural responses. The deformation and stresses distribution of the transmission <b>angle</b> <b>tower</b> are computed to explore the structural performance. The made observations indicate that the peak stresses of some members are large than the permitted yielding stresses of steel material...|$|E

The {{unstable}} {{political situation}} in which Venice found itself {{at the time of}} the League of Cambrai, but also the more frequent incursions and attacks of the Uskoks in the later sixteenth century, were responsible for the surrounding the town of Cres, its medieval nucleus and the newly formed town areas with a wider and stronger fortification system of a regular square plan, with four round towers at the angles and one rectangular tower located in the north-east area, and four town gates. The only <b>angle</b> <b>tower</b> that still survives is the north-west land tower based on which other towers can be reconstructed. Three of the four town gates have been preserved: the Harbour gate, on the ground floor of the Clock Tower, and two east gates: Porta Marcella and Porta Bragadina. All three are constructed in the mannerist style of the classical architectural language, with rusticated arches flanked by two Tuscan or Ionic half-columns articulated with stone rings. These half-columns carry an architrave with coats of arms, which terminates with a projecting cornice. Most reliable sources for the dating of the building phases of the Renaissance fortifications, and for the identification of the master-carvers who worked on them are the register of the decisions of the Town Council, and the Book of the Building of the Walls (Libro della fabbrica delle mura) which is in the State Archives at Rijeka and contains records of payments for the construction expenses for individual parts of the walls. The book covers the period between 1514 and 1610, the year when the construction expenses were concluded, although the works on the finishing of the individual parts continued until 1689, the year carved in the inscription referring to the completion of the wall. The article analyses the building phases of the individual segments, and the groups of master-carvers who worked on them. It identifies the stone-cutting family workshops Stošić, Zvonarić, Soldatić and Mladinić, but also a number of local and foreign master-carvers who appeared in the individual building phases. Among them, a special place belongs to Izidor Stošić who was mentioned between 1521 and 1559 as the Protomagister of the structure and, based on the commission of the Town Council; he is identified as the builder of the town’s Clock Tower. The mentioned town portals clearly demonstrate the way in which the local builders, gathered around the local workshops, applied the projects embodying contemporary stylistic tendencies which were doubtlessly works of the yet unidentified Venetian architects...|$|E

5000|$|William Wallace {{is said to}} {{have taken}} refuge from {{pursuing}} English soldiers within the tower, eventually escaping siege by climbing down an overhanging tree. It has a practical, if not authentic, roof which does not hide a view of the continuous corbelling of the parapet. The bottom section of the four <b>angle</b> <b>towers</b> are discernible.|$|R

50|$|The {{structures}} {{around the}} courtyard have undergone much renovation, reconstruction and repair. It {{is evident that}} the structure has {{lost much of its}} original given it some durability. Many modern extensions were also added to the original building. The three storied gateway on the river side has assumed some colonial features. The triple windows and the lofty <b>angle</b> <b>towers</b> reflect the colonial influence during subsequent restoration.|$|R
50|$|The site {{selected}} for the castle is naturally defended by the Kamenka and Lida rivers to east and west. Construction of boulder walls {{was carried out in}} 1323, 1324, and 1325. Later they were faced with red brick. The castle had two <b>angle</b> <b>towers</b> and a church, which was moved outside the walls in 1533. The upper storeys of both towers were lived in.|$|R
5|$|Hydro-Québec TransÉnergie uses a {{combination}} of double-circuit three-level pylons and single-circuit delta pylons to suspend electrical conductors of other voltages, such as 315kV. The ±450kV high-voltage direct current line in Hydro-Québec's power grid uses a T-shaped tower, lattice or pole, to support two bundles of three conductors on each side. The direct current power line sometimes uses two poles or a wider, pyramidal, self-supporting lattice structure for <b>angle</b> <b>towers.</b>|$|R
50|$|A quadrangular castle or {{courtyard}} castle {{is a type}} of castle characterised by {{ranges of}} buildings which are integral with the curtain walls, enclosing a central ward or quadrangle, and typically with <b>angle</b> <b>towers.</b> There is no keep and frequently no distinct gatehouse. The quadrangular form predominantly dates from the mid to late fourteenth century and signals the transition from defensively to domestically oriented great houses. The four walls are also known as ranges.|$|R
5000|$|The castle {{was founded}} by Sir William De Aldeburgh; he was granted a licence to crenellate in 1366. He built the {{rectangular}} tower house on a steep slope, where it is visible for miles around. The main block of two storeys is flanked by four <b>angle</b> <b>towers,</b> one being a plain entrance tower; the chapel is situated over the portcullis chamber. The lower kitchen wing is of four storeys, with a barrel-vaulted basement containing the well.|$|R

5000|$|The wall {{originally}} had four gates. The North {{is believed to}} have been to first to go before the 18th century, followed by the West gate in 1754 and the East gate in 1771. Only the South Gate remains intact today. [...] The South Gate and surrounding area is well-preserved, with two <b>angle</b> <b>towers</b> still intact. The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales summarises it as the [...] "remains of a stone curtain, describing a pentagonal figure about the central part of the borough of Cowbridge".|$|R
50|$|Early in the 11th century, {{the son of}} Fucaldus built {{a square}} keep, still {{identifiable}} {{at the heart of}} the present site. Two entrance towers were built from 1350, with three <b>angle</b> <b>towers</b> following, along with a heightening of the keep, in 1453. Galleries and a grand staircase, the latter attributed to designs by Leonardo da Vinci, were added in 1520. Much of the mediaeval building was demolished in 1615 when the courtyard was opened out and improvements were made to honour a visit by Louis XIII of France. There was some rebuilding in 1760, following a fire.|$|R
50|$|Substantial remains {{are still}} present today, {{including}} a rare cylindrical keep, a curtain wall {{flanked by two}} half-round towers, a twin-towered gatehouse and an <b>angled</b> <b>tower.</b> A survey conducted {{in the nineteenth century}} identified five towers ranging from 35 to 41 feet external diameter, and the keep, 50 feet in diameter. One author has noted similarities of the plan to Montlhery near Paris, France, which Ranulph de Blondeville may have been familiar with. M.W. Thompson has noted numerous architectural similarities between Chartley, Bolingbroke Castle, Lincolnshire, and also Beeston Castle in Cheshire, all thought to have been built under de Blondeville.|$|R

50|$|Mountjoy Castle is {{situated}} {{near the village}} of Mountjoy, in Magheralamfield townland in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, on a hill overlooking Lough Neagh. It was built by Lord Mountjoy in 1602 and partly burned in 1643 by Captain Turlough Gruama O'Quin. It is a two-storey brick building and the lower storey is stone-faced on the outside. It consists of a central rectangular block with four spear-shaped <b>angle</b> <b>towers</b> with gun loops. The north west tower is partly demolished and the west curtain wall destroyed. The entrance was {{on the south side of}} the east curtain wall. On the first floor there are some wide windows.|$|R
25|$|From the outside, the Great Mosque of Kairouan is a fortress-like building, which {{required}} {{as much by}} its massive ocher walls of 1.90 meters thick composed of well-worked stones, courses of rubble stone and courses of baked bricks, as the square <b>angle</b> <b>towers</b> measuring 4.25 meters on each side and the solid and projecting buttresses that support and bind. More than a defensive role, the buttresses and towers full serve more to enhance {{the stability of the}} mosque built on a soil subject to compaction. Although a seemingly harsh, the external facades, punctuated with powerful buttresses and towering porches, some of which are surmounted by cupolas, give to the sanctuary a striking aspect characterized by majestic sobriety.|$|R
