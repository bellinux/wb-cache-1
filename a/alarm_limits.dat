5000|$|The {{invention}} in {{this case}} was a method of calculating <b>alarm</b> <b>limits</b> by using a [...] "smoothing algorithm" [...] to make the system responsive to trends but not momentary fluctuations in process variables (such as temperature). Because it was conceded that the implementation of the algorithm was conventional, the Court found that the inventor did not even purport to have invented anything on which a patent could be granted. The Court did so {{on the basis of the}} principle that the nonstatutory subject matter (the algorithm) must be regarded as already in the prior art. Therefore, there was nothing left on which a patent could issue. In a case in which a patent was sought on an implementation of a principle (the algorithm), the implementation itself must be inventive for a patent to issue. Since that was not so, the Court held that the patent office had properly rejected Flook's claim to a patent. The Court relied on the decision in Neilson v. Harford, an English case that the Supreme Court had relied upon in O'Reilly v. Morse, for the proposition that an idea or principle must be treated as if it were already in the prior art, irrespective of whether it was actually new or old. This approach is something like that of analytic dissection in computer-software copyright law, although its use in patent law preceded its use in copyright law by a century or more.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the rate of compliance with hospital guidelines for <b>alarm</b> <b>limits</b> for pulse oximetry in preterm infants on oxygen therapy. METHODS. All infants admitted to the nurseries at the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, with gestational age < 32 weeks or birth weight < 1500 g between August 2005 and February 2006 were eligible for inclusion. Data on the <b>alarm</b> <b>limits</b> set for infants on oxygen therapy were collected prospectively. The target saturation range recommended in written hospital guidelines was 88 % to 92 %, with <b>alarm</b> <b>limits</b> set at 85 % and 94 %. RESULTS. Data were prospectively collected for 144 subjects with mean (SD) gestational age 29. 3 (2. 4) weeks and birth weight 1226 (354) g; 1073 <b>alarm</b> <b>limits</b> were collected when infants were on oxygen. The lower alarm limit was set correctly 91. 1 % of the time. In contrast, the upper alarm limit was set correctly only 23. 3 % of the time: 76. 5 % of the time it was too high, and 23. 8 % of the time it was set at 100 %. Infants with an upper alarm limit set correctly on a particular day had a significantly lower birth weight, gestational age, postmenstrual age, and postnatal age than infants who had the upper alarm limit set too high. Use of assisted ventilation, higher inspired oxygen concentrations, and more frequent changes in inspired oxygen concentration were all associated with improved odds of having an appropriately set upper alarm limit. CONCLUSIONS. This study suggests that current guidelines regarding the upper pulse oximeter alarm limit for infants receiving oxygen might be commonly exceeded, although compliance might be better for infants at higher risk of adverse outcomes. However, there might be less variation from guidelines for the lower alarm limit...|$|E

This study was conducted among residents working at ICU of a multispeciality centre, {{with the help of a}} printed questionnaire. The study involved 80 residents. All residents were in full agreement on routine use of ECG, pulse oximeter, capnograph and NIBP monitoring. 86 % residents realised the necessity of monitoring oxygen concentration, apnoea monitoring and expired minute ventilation monitoring. 87 % PGs and 70 % SRs routinely checked <b>alarm</b> <b>limits</b> for various parameters. 50 % PGs and 46. 6 % SRs set these <b>alarm</b> <b>limits.</b> The initial response to an alarm among all the residents was to disable the alarm temporarily and try to look for a cause. 92 % of PGs and 98 % of SRs were aware of alarms priority and colour coding. 55 % residents believed that the alarm occurred due to patient disturbance, 15 % believed that alarm was due to technical problem with monitor/sensor and 30 % thought it was truly related to patient’s clinical status. 82 % residents set the alarms by themselves, 10 % believed that alarms should be adjusted by nurse, 4 % believed the technical staff should take responsibility of setting <b>alarm</b> <b>limits</b> and 4 % believed that alarm levels should be pre-adjusted by the manufacturer. We conclude that although alarms are an important, indispensable, and lifesaving feature, they can be a nuisance and can compromise quality and safety of care by frequent false positive alarms.

50|$|Fault {{detection}} for a {{horde of}} industrial robots experiences similar difficulties as lack of fault detection models and dynamic operating condition. Industrial robots are crucial in automotive manufacturing and perform different tasks as welding, material handling, painting, etc. In this scenario, robotic maintenance becomes critical to ensure continuous production and avoid downtime.

Critical model parameters like training samples, components, and <b>alarming</b> <b>limits</b> are set {{the same for all}} the units regardless of their different functionalities. Even though these identical fault detection models can effectively identify faults sometimes, numerous false alarms discourage users from trusting the reliability of the system.

This peer to peer comparison methodology inside a machine network could improve the fault detection accuracy significantly.|$|R
40|$|Random {{testing is}} one of the more common test strategies. It does not assume any {{knowledge}} of the system under test, its specifications, or its internal design. This technique is insufficient for validating complex, safety-critical or mission-critical software. The structural testing approach systematically derives the test procedures from the external and internal specifications. Therefore, the term test design best describes the mental activity behind this method. The structural testing approach divides the input data space into subdomains. The criteria for this partitioning are given by the external specification of the system. Each subdomain is an equivalence class which is tested by choosing some representatives. But what if the subdomain is heterogeneous, has unknown side effects, or includes errors if executed in a particular order? (A heterogeneous subdomain includes both good and bad data points. Good means that the system works as specified, whereas bad data leads to system failure. For example, in the heart rate alarm test described in the accompanying article, the high <b>alarm</b> <b>limit</b> domain may contain data points that, when applied to the patient monitor, produce no high <b>limit</b> <b>alarm.</b> Other data points may behave as expected). Unfortunately, the subdomains are seldom homogenous or disjoint.

It differs significantly, therefore, from traditional PUREX process facilities in both processing technology and safeguards implications. For example, the fissile material is processed in FCF only in batches and is transferred within the facility only as solid, well-characterized items; there are no liquid steams containing fissile material within the facility, nor entering or leaving the facility. The analysis of a single batch lends itself also to an analytical relationship between the safeguards criteria, such as <b>alarm</b> <b>limit,</b> detection probability, and maximum significant amount of fissile material, and the accounting system`s performance, as it is reflected in the variance associated with the estimate of the inventory difference.

It includes the ability of the navigation system to provide timely warnings to users when the system fails to meet its stated accuracy. Specifically, a navigation system is required to deliver a warning (alarm) when the error in the derived user position solution exceeds an allowable level (<b>alarm</b> <b>limit).</b> This warning must be issued to the user within a given period of time (time-to-alarm) and with a given probability (integrity risk).

This is not an optimal situation since it may be both difficult and dangerous to locate and measure {{the length of a}} wheel flat. Further, a given size of a wheel flat will result in different impact loads if present on different types of vehicles due to differences in train speed, axle load, etc, and on different tracks with differences in track properties.

Three different types of traffic are investigated: heavy haul at 60 km/h (axle load 30 tonnes), freight at 100 km/h (25 tonnes) and passenger at 200 km/h (21 tonnes). Positive bending moments generating tensional stresses in the rail foot and negative bending moments leading to tensional stresses in the rail head are calculated. The model is calibrated with respect to field measurements. An idealised time history of the impact load due to a wheel flat is suggested, and worst-case scenarios are sought for in parametric studies.
