5|$|Contradicting {{the noon}} and 3pm timelines, Mohammed Tawil, {{the doctor who}} {{admitted}} Muhammad to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, told Esther Schapira that the boy had been admitted around 10:00am local time, along with the ambulance driver, who had been shot through the heart. Tawil later {{said that he could}} not recall what he had told reporters about this. Records from the Al-Shifa Hospital reportedly show that a young boy was examined in the pathology department at midday. The pathologist, Dr.Abed El-Razeq El Masry, examined him for half an hour. He told Schapira that the boy's abdominal organs were lying outside his body, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> Schapira , with a card identifying the boy as Muhammad. A watch on a pathologist's wrist in one of the images appeared to say 3:50.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{spent most}} of this time {{exploring}} on land: three years and three months on land, 18 months at sea. Early in the voyage {{he decided that he}} could write a book about geology, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> a gift for theorising. At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection.|$|E

5|$|His father {{encouraged}} him to play sport <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> promise {{in a variety of}} ball sports, particularly cricket, rugby and tennis. Aged 12, he gained a place as a slow bowler for Newcastle Boys' High School's cricket team. On Saturday afternoons he played for Blackwall, a team in the local C-grade competition. Morris attended Canterbury Boys' High School from 1936 to 1939 where he represented the school at cricket and rugby union, and was appointed school captain (head boy) in Year 11.|$|E
5|$|In 1963–64, Chappell batted {{at number}} three for SA {{for the first}} time, in a match against Queensland at Brisbane, and scored 205 not out. He was the {{youngest}} member of the SA team that won the Sheffield Shield that season. A century against Victoria early the following season resulted in Chappell's selection for a one-off Test against Pakistan at Melbourne in December 1964. He made 11 and took four catches, but was dropped until the Fourth Test in the 1965–66 Ashes series. Chappell supplemented his aggressive batting with brilliant fielding in the slips, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> promise as a leg-spinner. At this point, the selectors and captain Bob Simpson considered him an all-rounder: he batted at number seven and bowled 26 (eight-ball) overs for the match.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{is the most}} {{carnivorous}} member of the Hyaenidae. Unlike its brown and striped cousins, the spotted hyena is a predator, not a scavenger; this has been shown since the 1960s. One of the earliest studies to demonstrate their hunting abilities was done by Hans Kruuk, an African wildlife ecologist, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> through a 7-year study of hyena populations in Africa that spotted hyenas hunt as much as lions, and with later studies this {{has been shown to}} be the average in all areas of Africa. However spotted hyenas remain being mislabeled as scavengers, often even by ecologists and wildlife documentary channels.|$|E

On one occasion, while testing a service gas mask against Hydrogen sulfide (H2S); the gas penetrated almost immediately and Livens fell unconscious though he recovered quickly. During the war, Livens was awarded the Military Cross on 14 January 1916 and the Distinguished Service Order on 1 January 1918.|$|E
25|$|George {{reconciled}} {{the issues}} of efficiency and equity, showing that both could be satisfied under a system in harmony with natural law. He showed that Ricardo's Law of Rent applied not just to an agricultural economy, but even more so to urban economics. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> {{that there is no}} inherent conflict between labor and capital provided one maintained a clear distinction between classical factors of production, capital and land.|$|E
25|$|Halliday played {{twice for}} the MCC. He first played {{for them in}} July 1984 against Scotland at Lord's. His next game for them came in July 1999, ten years after his last game for Ireland.

25|$|By December 1999, Anderson {{was working}} on plans for a {{computer}} animated sequel to Captain Scarlet, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> early test reels at a few fan conventions. These reels had the visual design and characters looking very much as {{they had in the}} original show, although the vehicle designs had been somewhat modernised. Several years after the initial tests the project evolved into the remake Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet, by which time the entire appearance had been significantly updated.|$|E
25|$|After 1968, when Bolte turned 60, {{his appeal}} to younger urban voters declined, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> little sympathy with new {{issues such as}} the {{environment}} and civil liberties. His standing was also reduced by a crisis in the state education system, with teacher shortages and overcrowded schools as the children of the baby boom passed through the education system. The government recruited large numbers of American schoolteachers to deal with the shortage. At the same time the Labor Party began to revive under a new leader, Clyde Holding.|$|E
25|$|After quitting the Spurs manager's job, Nicholson {{spent a year}} at West Ham United as an adviser. When Keith Burkinshaw became Spurs' {{manager in}} 1976, {{one of his first}} {{requests}} was that Nicholson be brought back to White Hart Lane as a consultant. His knowledge and experience were invaluable, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> that he still had an eye for players by recommending several to Burkinshaw, including Graham Roberts, Tony Galvin, and Gary Mabbutt. Nicholson continued to work as a consultant until 1991, when he was awarded the title of Club President.|$|E

25|$|In 1919 Phoebus Levene at the Rockefeller Institute {{identified}} the components (the four bases, {{the sugar and}} the phosphate chain) <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> that the components of DNA were linked in the order phosphate-sugar-base. He called each of these units a nucleotide and suggested the DNA molecule consisted {{of a string of}} nucleotide units linked together through the phosphate groups, which are the 'backbone' of the molecule. However Levene thought the chain was short and that the bases repeated in the same fixed order. Torbjörn Caspersson and Einar Hammersten showed that DNA was a polymer.|$|E
25|$|After Li Zheng's death, Li Dian was {{appointed}} as the Prefect (令) of Yingyin County (潁陰縣; in present-day Xuchang, Henan) and General of the Household (中郎將), {{and took over}} command of his cousin's troops. Li Dian {{was known to be}} very studious since he was a youth, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> little interest in military affairs. He read classics such as the Spring and Autumn Annals and the Zuo Zhuan. Cao Cao was pleased with Li Dian and wanted to test his abilities. He reassigned Li Dian to be the Administrator (太守) of Lihu Commandery (離狐郡; southeast of present-day Dongming, Shandong), where Li was primarily in charge of managing civil affairs.|$|E
25|$|Though his {{ministry}} covered {{the period of}} greatest activity in the adaptation of Judaism in America to changed conditions, he, as the advocate of Orthodox Judaism, withstood every appeal in behalf of ritualistic innovations and departures from traditional practice, winning the esteem of his opponents by his consistency and integrity. His sermons covered a wide scope of thought and action, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> the loftiness of his spirit when, in spite of congregational opposition to the expression of his views during the American Civil War, he continued, both in prayer and in his discourses, to show his warm sympathy with {{the cause of the}} slave. In appreciation of his attitude during these trying times the Union League Club of Philadelphia placed him on the roll of its honorary members.|$|E

25|$|Crispi was a {{colourful}} and intensely patriotic character. He {{was a man}} {{of enormous}} energy but with a violent temper. His whole life, public and private, was turbulent, dramatic and marked by a succession of bitter personal hostilities. According to some Crispi’s “fiery pride, almost insane touchiness and indifference to sound methods of government” were due to his Albanian inheritance. Although he began life as a revolutionary and democratic figure, his premiership was authoritarian <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> disdain for Italian liberals. He was born as a firebrand and died as firefighter. At the end of the 19th century, Crispi was the dominant figure of Italian politics for a decade. He was saluted by Giuseppe Verdi as 'the great patriot'. He was a more scrupulous statesman than Cavour, a more realistic conspirator than Mazzini, a more astute figure than Garibaldi. His death resulted in lengthier obituaries in Europe's press than for any Italian politician since Cavour.|$|E
25|$|Bainton {{was born}} in Hackney, London, the son of George Bainton, a Congregational minister, and his wife, Mary, née Cave. Bainton later moved {{with his family to}} Coventry <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> early signs of musical ability playing the piano; he was nine years old when he made his first public {{appearance}} as solo pianist. He was awarded a music scholarship to King Henry VIII Grammar School in Coventry in 1891, and in 1896 he won an open scholarship to the Royal College of Music to study theory with Walford Davies. In 1899 he received a scholarship to study composition with Sir Charles Villiers Stanford. At college he became friends with George Dyson, William Harris and especially Rutland Boughton, whose friendship and support continued throughout Bainton's career. Bainton kept a notebook listing nearly all his compositions, the first entry being his first known surviving work, Prelude and Fugue in B minor for piano, written in 1898.|$|E
25|$|He {{supported}} the parliamentarians against the republican or army party, {{and appears to}} {{have been one of the}} members excluded in 1648. He sat in Richard Cromwell's parliament for Member of Parliament for Dublin City, and endeavoured to take his seat in the restored Rump Parliament of 1659. He was made President of the Council of State in February 1660, and in the Convention Parliament sat for Carmarthen. The anarchy of the last months of The Protectorate converted him to royalism, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> great activity in bringing about the English Restoration. He used his influence in moderating measures of revenge and violence, and while sitting in judgement on the regicides was on the side of leniency. He was sworn of the Privy Council on 1 June and in November he succeeded his father as Viscount Valentia in the Irish peerage. On 20 April 1661, he was created Baron Annesley, of Newport Pagnell in Buckinghamshire and Earl of Anglesey in the Peerage of England.|$|E

[...] Dave Jones [...] Chopra {{completed}} a permanent move on 1 July following {{the opening of the}} transfer window for a fee of £3 million. The transfer smashed the club's transfer record which was previously held by the £1.75 million signing of Peter Thorne from Stoke City in 2001. He scored on his debut, netting the first and third goals in a 4-0 victory over Rotherham United. Chopra then would score in consecutive matches against Blackpool, Plymouth Argyle, Bristol City and Bristol Rovers. In the post-match ceremony, manager Dave Jones commented, [...] "Chopra is on fire, he's scored seven goals already <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> <b>shown</b> <b>he</b> {{will get the}} goals if he gets the supply". Chopra finished the season with a total of 21 goals, including a four-goal haul against Derby County. For a second time, he was included in the PFA Team of the Year.|$|R
