500|$|In {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision. [...] "It {{was the wrong}} decision, and I think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that. There's {{no doubt in my}} mind I would have made those saves. And the fact of the matter is it's not 2004 anymore. It's not 2004. And it's 2007, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to live in the present. And you can't live by big names. You can't live in the past. It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to these, a Hall of Fame chief executive said, [...] "The definition of 'rock and roll' means {{different things to}} different people, but as broad as the classifications may be, they all share a common love of the music." [...] Roger Glover remains ambivalent about induction and got an inside word from the Hall, [...] "One of the jurors said, ‘You know, Deep Purple, they’re just one-hit wonders.’ How can you deal with that kind of Philistinism, you know?". Ian Gillan also commented, [...] "I've fought all my life against being institutionalised <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to actively search these things out, in other words mingle with the right people, and we don't get invited to those kind of things." [...] On 16 October 2013 Deep Purple were again announced as nominees for inclusion to the Hall, and once again they were not inducted.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are forgiven," [...] she said. [...] "For, {{although}} you have committed a serious fault, {{you are now}} penitent <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been punished enough. Soldier, release Ojo the Lucky and--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's right, Wingfield," [...] {{the lawyer}} said. [...] "You see we have settled the {{business}} satisfactorily, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got a fairly cheap bargain. Just {{wait a minute}} and we will complete the transaction." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope so. I {{thought there}} always had been. I am sure, mamma, you {{have known that}} I have never liked Captain Scarborough so as to become his wife, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> known that I have liked Harry Annesley." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For all that, in a way, {{there was}} some truth in the story; enough, in fact, to make it dangerous, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been rash. Bob has been here too often, and you will {{remember}} I objected to his coming." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Right, old boy," [...] Ned said, {{making a}} great effort to {{overcome}} his first sensation of disgust. [...] "As you say, it is a trifle. You have hit upon a superb idea, Dick, superb; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> saved our lives from {{what seemed a}} hopeless scrape. But what is your other disguise?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall dread {{you as a}} critic, cousin Annie," [...] so Bulstrode often termed Anneke, as I soon discovered; [...] "I {{find you}} are not too well {{disposed}} to us of the cockade, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a particular spite to our regiment. I know that Billings and Harris, too, hold you in the greatest possible dread." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{a comfort}} that often trials, and even falls, do deepen the soil, {{so that the}} roots may have a better hold another time," [...] said Mr. Somers. [...] "I think there is good hope that {{so it will be}} with poor little Amy. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> some good soil to tell me of." ...|$|E
60|$|We are {{now getting}} our Christmas extra number together, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are {{the boy to}} do, if you will, one of the stories.|$|R
60|$|JUNO. Yes I do. Or {{at least}} I did. But I'm an Englishman; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> ought {{to respect the}} {{conventions}} of English life.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understood}} {{you very}} well, Dr. Tempest, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> to be a most unreasonable man. Indeed, I might use a much harsher word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, she {{has told}} me. We don't have many secrets in this house. And I'm sure I congratulate you {{with all my}} heart; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got the very best girl in all the world. Of course I'm her mother; but I declare, if I was to talk of her for a week, I could not say {{anything}} of her but good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Henry, Sir Henry," [...] and he toddled to a window. [...] "Here; you'll be {{spending}} a lot of money on her in foreign parts, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> behaved well; here," [...] and he slipped a bit of paper into his hands. [...] "But, remember, it will be the last. And, Sir Henry, remember the interest of the three thousand--punctually--eh, Sir Henry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{this remark}} Raybold paid no attention. [...] "I will tell you," [...] he said, [...] "confidentially, of course, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> as much {{reason to be}} {{interested}} in it as I have, why I came to view with so much favor my sister's coming here. She is a very attractive young woman, and I think she cannot fail to interest Clyde, and that, of course, will be of advantage to your niece." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Harry, [...] "I suppose I {{ought to}} be President. And then {{we must have a}} Treasurer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> should be Treasurer." ...|$|R
60|$|I have {{bundled up}} Livy's picture and {{will try and}} {{recollect}} to mail it tomorrow. It is a porcelaintype <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> will like it.|$|R
6000|$|... "What I {{long ago}} said is true. You'll never know now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{ought to be}} content. You've had it," [...] said May Bartram.|$|R
6000|$|... "My plan {{involves}} much danger; but I see no other, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{courage to}} brave it. It is this. There {{is an island}} about fifty {{miles to the south}} of this, the natives of which are Christians, and have been so for two years or more, and the principal chief is Avatea's lover. Once there, Avatea would be safe. Now, I suggest that you should abandon your schooner. Do you think that you can make so great a sacrifice?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; for one thing, you {{can keep}} your temper, and Jack, who is quick at numbers, cannot; that is an {{excellent}} lesson, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> learned it well. Then, you can play the violin, and not one of the lads can, though they want to do it very much. But, best of all, Nat, you really care to learn something, and that is half the battle. It seems hard at first, and you will feel discouraged, but plod away, and things will get easier and easier as you go on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{for another}} beginning! And now, good-morning, Captain Clavering. I will do my {{possible}} with Julie. Julie is {{very fond of}} me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been right in coming here. But twenty pounds was too little, even for a beginning." [...] Mercenary wretch; hungry, greedy, ill-conditioned woman--altogether of the harpy breed! As Archie Clavering looked into her gray eyes, and saw there her greed and her hunger, his flesh crept upon his bones. Should he not succeed with Julia, how much would this excellent lady cost him? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} must seem so to <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> take things too hard, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> take things too easily. We can never agree." ...|$|R
30|$|Nathan: <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{need to keep}} it focused, {{just very}} simplistic. Being able to just hit those things [standards] without having all these other detours.|$|R
6000|$|Appleby {{smiled a}} little, though it {{apparently}} cost him an effort. “Well,” he said, “I’m not burdened with money yet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can afford it.” ...|$|R
6000|$|I am {{too proud}} of being your friend, to care with whom I am linked in your estimation, and, God knows, I want friends more at this time than at any other. I am [...] "taking care of myself" [...] to no great purpose. If you knew my {{situation}} in every point of view, you would excuse apparent and unintentional neglect. I shall leave town, I think; but do not you leave it without seeing me. I wish you, from my soul, every happiness you can wish yourself; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> taken the road to secure it. Peace be with you! I fear she has abandoned me. Ever, etc.|$|E
6000|$|She {{seemed to}} be {{appealing}} to him for confirmation, {{but he could not}} very well say that she was right, and he kept silent. [...] "I didn't like your telling that story at the dinner, and I said so; and then I went and did the same thing, or worse; so that I have nothing to say about that. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> behaved very nobly to Mr. St. John." [...] As if at some sign of protest in Hewson, she insisted, [...] "Yes, I do! But all this doesn't prove that I love you." [...] Again she seemed to appeal to him, and this time he thought he might answer her appeal.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Mr. Owl,' said old Mother Nature gently, 'you {{now know}} {{something}} of the misery and the suffering which you have caused others, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been punished enough. No more may you fly abroad over the Green Meadows while the day is bright, for still is the fear {{of you in the}} hearts of all my little meadow people, but hereafter you shall not find it so difficult to get enough to eat. Your eyes shall grow big, bigger than the eyes of any other bird, so that you shall be able to see in the dusk and even in the dark. Your ears shall grow large, larger than the ears of any of the little forest or meadow people, so that you can hear the very least sound. Your feathers shall become as soft as down, so that when you fly none shall hear you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know papa {{would like}} to have me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would be less {{hampered}} in what you will have to do now if I'm not here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want to be}} ever so much better, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> {{they might}} show me how," [...] said Fanny, with a traitorous tremble in her voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> could, dear, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> ought. May <b>I</b> speak quite freely, {{and will}} you {{remember}} that it's Mother who blames as well as Mother who sympathizes?" ...|$|R
