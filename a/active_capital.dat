Hiei and Kirishima acted as escorts during the attack on Pearl Harbor, while Kongō and Haruna supported the invasion of Singapore. All four participated in the battles of Midway and Guadalcanal. Hiei and Kirishima were both lost during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in November 1942, while Haruna and Kongō jointly bombarded Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. The two remaining Kongō-class battleships spent most of 1943 shuttling between Japanese naval bases before participating in the major naval campaigns of 1944. Haruna and Kongō engaged American surface vessels during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Kongō was torpedoed by USS Sealion in November 1944, while Haruna was sunk at her moorings by air attack in Kure Naval Base in late July 1945 and subsequently scrapped.|$|E
25|$|Susa was {{an ancient}} city (5500 B.C.E) {{even by the}} time of the Achaemenids. Susa became a part of the Achaemenid Empire in 539 B.C.E., and was {{expanded}} upon by Darius the Great with construction of Palace of Darius, and later development of palace of Artaxerxes II. The palace had a unique Apadana, resembling the one in Persepolis, except this hall was much larger than its Persepolis counterpart covering some 9,200 square meters. Cyrus the Great chose Susa as a site for one of his fortifications creating a wall there that was significantly taller than older walls made by the Elamites. This choice might have been to facilitate the trade from Persian Gulf northward. What remains in way of structure from this once <b>active</b> <b>capital,</b> are five archaeological mounds, today located in modern Shush, in southwestern Iran, scattered over 250 hectares.|$|E

By suffering the several districts, and several of the individuals in each district, to judge of what part of the old revenue they might withhold, instead of better principles of equality, a new inequality was introduced of the most oppressive kind. Payments were regulated by dispositions. The parts of the kingdom which were the most submissive, the most orderly, or the most affectionate to the commonwealth, bore the whole burden of the state. Nothing turns out to be so oppressive and unjust as a feeble government. To fill up all the deficiencies in the old impositions, and the new deficiencies of every kind which were to be expected, what remained to a state without authority? The National Assembly called for a voluntary benevolence,--for a fourth part of the income of all the citizens, to be estimated on the honor of those who were to pay. They obtained something more than could be rationally calculated, but what was far indeed from answerable to their real necessities, and much less to their fond expectations. Rational people could have hoped for little from this their tax in the disguise of a benevolence,--tax weak, ineffective, and unequal,--a tax by which luxury, avarice, and selfishness were screened, and the load thrown upon productive capital, upon integrity, generosity, and public spirit,--a tax of regulation upon virtue. At length the mask is thrown off, and they are now trying means (with little success) of exacting their benevolence by force.|$|E

40|$|I {{study the}} asset pricing {{implications}} {{of the presence of}} active cap-ital. I define <b>active</b> <b>capital</b> as a form of ownership where some owners put skin in the game which makes firms more productive. In gen-eral equilibrium, <b>active</b> <b>capital</b> distorts risk sharing: aggregate risk is borne by levered active investors and regular ones are relieved from it. This effect tends to lower the risk price of all shocks. Dynamically, changes in the level of <b>active</b> <b>capital,</b> through deleveraging effects cre-ates additional fluctuations in asset prices. I show that risk and risk aversion are negatively related to the supply of <b>active</b> <b>capital.</b> Fluctu-ations in <b>active</b> <b>capital</b> are therefore amplified by fluctuations in risk premium. This causes risk premium shocks to command a higher risk price. These two effects help explain the failure of cash-flow risk to explain asset returns and the importance of changes in risk premium. Additionally, it justifies the negative correlation of the quantity of <b>active</b> <b>capital</b> with the risk premium and its role for explaining the cross-section of returns...|$|E

40|$|I {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of asset prices in an economy in which investors choose whether to hold diversified or concentrated portfolios of risky assets. The latter are valuable, as they increase the productivity of the corresponding enterprises. I capture the tradeoff between risk sharing and productivity gains by introducing what I call “active capital”: people who participate in such investments are restricted in their outside opportunities but receive extra compensation. In equilibrium, active and standard capital coexist. The willingness to provide <b>active</b> <b>capital</b> is mainly determined by risk considerations. Therefore, the quantity of <b>active</b> <b>capital</b> fluctuates jointly with risk premia, amplifying their variations. As a consequence, the price of volatility risk exposure can be large and return volatility is mainly induced by fluctuations in future expected returns. These results are particularly strong when fundamental volatility is low, because at such time, {{a large number of}} concentrated owners are likely to exit their positions and sell off their assets. Buyout Activity: The Impact of Aggregate Discount Rates (with Erik Loualiche and Matthew Plosser) We argue buyout waves form in response to fluctuations in aggregate discount rates. In our model, discount rates alter the present value of cash-flow improvements and the illiquidity premium demanded by buyout investors. We empirically confirm our predictions. Overall deal activity varies positively with the risk premium and negatively with the risk-free rate, wit...|$|E
