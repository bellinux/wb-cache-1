40|$|A diet {{high in fat}} induces cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation, and {{oxidative}} stress. Although {{such actions}} have largely been ascribed to fat deposition, the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and subsequent activation of the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) may also represent important mediators of cardiac injury following exposure to a Western diet. In this study, male C 57 BL 6 J and RAGE knockout mice were placed on either a standard diet (7 % fat) or a Western “fast-food” diet (21 % fat). Animals receiving a high-fat diet were further randomized to receive the AGE inhibitor <b>alagebrium</b> <b>chloride</b> (1 mg·kg− 1 ·day− 1) and followed for 16 wk. A Western diet was associated with cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation, mitochondrial-dependent superoxide production, and cardiac AGE accumulation in wild-type mice. Although RAGE-KO mice fed a Western diet also became obese and accumulated intramyocardial lipid, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, inflammation, and oxidative stress were attenuated compared with wild-type mice. Similarly, mice of both strains receiving <b>alagebrium</b> <b>chloride</b> had reduced levels of inflammation and oxidative stress, in association with a reduction in cardiac AGEs and RAGE. This study suggests that AGEs represent important mediators of cardiac injury associated with a Western fast-food diet. These data point to the potential utility of AGE-reducing strategies in the prevention and management of cardiac disease...|$|E
40|$|Aims/hypothesis: This {{group of}} studies {{examines}} human genetic susceptibility conferred by the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) in {{type 1 diabetes}} and investigates how this may interact with a western environment. Methods: We analysed the AGER gene, using 13 tag SNPs, in 3, 624 Finnish individuals from the FinnDiane study, followed by AGER associations with a high risk HLA genotype (DR 3) -DQA 1 * 05 -DQB 1 * 02 /DRB 1 * 0401 - DQB 1 * 0302 (n= 546; HLA-DR 3 /DR 4), matched in healthy newborn infants from the Finnish Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention (DIPP) Study (n= 373) using allelic analysis. We also studied islets and circulating RAGE in NODLt mice. Results: The rs 2070600 and rs 17493811 polymorphisms predicted increased risk of type 1 diabetes, whereas the rs 9469089 SNP was related to decreased risk, on a high risk HLA background. Children from the DIPP study also showed a decline in circulating soluble RAGE levels, at seroconversion to positivity for type 1 diabetes-associated autoantibodies. Islet RAGE and circulating soluble RAGE levels in prediabetic NODLt mice decreased over time and were prevented by the AGE lowering therapy <b>alagebrium</b> <b>chloride.</b> <b>Alagebrium</b> <b>chloride</b> also decreased the incidence of autoimmune diabetes and restored islet RAGE levels. Conclusions/interpretation: These studies suggest that inherited AGER gene polymorphisms may confer susceptibility to environmental insults. Declining circulating levels of soluble RAGE, before the development of overt diabetes, may also be predictive of clinical disease in children with high to medium risk HLA II backgrounds and this possibility warrants further investigation in a larger cohort...|$|E
40|$|Advanced glycation end {{products}} (AGEs) and the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) generate ROS, {{and therefore}} this study evaluated {{the effects of}} RAGE deletion, decreasing AGE accumulation, or lowering dietary AGE content on oxidative parameters in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Control and diabetic male wild-type and RAGE-deficient (RAGE-/-) mice were fed high- or low-AGE diets, with two groups given the inhibitor of AGE accumulation, <b>alagebrium</b> <b>chloride,</b> and followed for 24 wk. Diabetic RAGE-/- mice were protected against albuminuria, hyper-filtration, glomerulosclerosis, decreased renal mitochondrial ATP production, and excess generation of both mitochondrial and cytosolic superoxide. Whereas glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial expansion, and hyperfiltration were improved in diabetic mice treated with alagebrium, there was no effect on urinary albumin excretion. Both diabetic RAGE-/- and alagebrium-treated mice had an attenuation of renal RAGE expression and decreased renal and urinary AGE (carboxymethyllysine) levels. Low-AGE diets did not confer renoprotection, lower the AGE burden or renal RAGE expression, or improve cytosolic or mitochondrial superoxide generation. Renal uncoupling protein- 2 gene expression and mitochondrial membrane potential were attenuated by all therapeutic interventions in diabetic mice. In the present study, diverse approaches to block the AGE-RAGE axis had disparate effects on DN, which has potential clinical implications for the way this axis should be targeted in humans.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Vascular {{perturbation}} {{induced by}} advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) leads to progression of atherosclerosis, plaque instability, and vascular inflammation, {{which results in}} {{a higher risk of}} neointimal proliferation. Here we investigated the inhibitory effect of <b>alagebrium</b> <b>chloride</b> (ALT- 711), a breaker of AGE-based cross links, on neointimal proliferation in a carotid artery balloon injury model in diabetic rats induced by streptozotocin (STZ). Materials and Methods: Rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) were treated with 1 - 100 μM of alagebrium added 24 hours before the addition of AGEs. This in vivo study was done using 8 -week-old male rats that were injected intraperitoneally with 80 mg/kg STZ. Sixteen weeks later, the diabetic rats were treated with 10 mg/kg alagebrium for 4 weeks, after which carotid artery balloon injury was induced. After 4 weeks, the animals were sacrificed for histological analysis. Results: Proliferation of RASMCs was significantly inhibited in alagebrium-treated cells. Alagebrium dose-dependently inhibited AGE-mediated formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, and cyclooxygenase- 2 expression. The cellular mechanisms of AGE-induced connective tissue and extracellular matrix expression were decreased in the alagebriumtreated group. This in vivo study shows that expression of AGE receptors and neointima hyperplasia are significantly suppressed in balloon-injured rats treated with alagebrium. Conclusion: Alagebrium treatment in diabetic rats significantly inhibits neointimal hyperplasia after carotid balloon injury due to its inhibition of intracellular ROS synthesis, which results in inhibition o...|$|E
40|$|Advanced glycation end {{products}} (AGEs) {{are involved}} in age-related diseases, including the complications of diabetes and chronic renal impairment with arterial stiffening. <b>Alagebrium</b> <b>chloride</b> (ALT- 711) is an AGE-lowering agent with beneficial effects in renal structural and functional parameters in diabetes, decreased diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis, and age-related myocardial stiffening. ALT- 711 exhibits a structural homology to thiamine, and it was suggested to interfere with thiamine metabolism. Thiamine is converted to thiamine diphosphate (TDP) by thiamine diphosphokinase (TDPK). TDP is a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and transketolase. A decreased activity of these enzymes due to TDP deficiency results in disorders such as beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Therefore, we investigated whether ALT- 711 is an inhibitor of TDPK. Molecular modeling studies showed that ALT- 711 fits into the thiamine-binding pocket of TDPK, and there are three interactions between the thiazolium ring and the enzyme, as well as parallel stacking between the phenyl ring and the indole ring of Trp 222 B. Enzyme kinetic experiments also showed that ALT- 711 dose-dependently decreased TDPK activity with K is, calculated by different experiments and fitting models ranging from 0. 88 to 1. 09 mM. Fitting of the kinetic data favored mixed-mode inhibition with a major role for competitive inhibition. In summary, our results suggest that ALT- 711 is a low-affinity inhibitor of TDPK, but is unlikely to interfere with thiamine metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. However, when new AGE-crosslink breakers based on thiamine are designed, care should be taken {{that they do not}} act as more potent competitive inhibitors than ALT- 711. © 2011 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Diabetic {{heart disease}} is a {{distinct}} clinical entity that can progress to heart failure and sudden death. However, the mechanisms responsible for the alterations in excitation-contraction coupling leading to cardiac dysfunction during diabetes are not well known. Hyperglycemia, the landmark of diabetes, leads {{to the formation of}} advanced glycation end products (AGE) on long-lived proteins, including SR Ca 2 + regulatory proteins. However, their pathogenic role on SR Ca 2 + handling in cardiac myocytes is unknown. Therefore, we investigated whether an AGE cross-link breaker could prevent the alterations in SR Ca 2 + cycling that lead to in vivo cardiac dysfunction during diabetes. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were treated with <b>Alagebrium</b> <b>Chloride</b> (ALT- 711) for 8 weeks and compared to age-matched placebo-treated diabetic rats and healthy rats. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiographic examination. Ventricular myocytes were isolated to assess SR Ca 2 + cycling by confocal imaging and quantitative Western blots. Diabetes resulted in in vivo cardiac dysfunction and ALT- 711 therapy partially alleviated diastolic dysfunction by decreasing isovolumetric relaxation time and myocardial performance index (by 27 and 41 % vs. untreated diabetic rats, respectively, P< 0. 05). In cardiac myocytes, diabetes induced prolongation of cytosolic Ca 2 + transient clearance by 43 % and decreased SR Ca 2 + load by 25 % (P< 0. 05); these parameters were partially improved after ALT- 711 therapy. SERCA 2 a and RyR 2 protein expression was significantly decreased in the myocardium of untreated diabetic rats (by 64 and 36 % vs. controls, respectively, P< 0. 05), but preserved in the treated diabetic group compared to controls. Collectively, our result suggest that, in a model of type 1 diabetes, AGE accumulation primarily impairs SR Ca 2 + reuptake in cardiac myocytes and that long term treatment with an AGE cross-link breaker partially normalized SR Ca 2 + handling and improved diabetic cardiomyopathy...|$|E
