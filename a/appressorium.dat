5|$|The {{mechanical}} pressure {{exerted by}} the <b>appressorium</b> is generated from physiological processes that increase intracellular turgor by producing osmolytes such as glycerol. Adaptations {{such as these}} are complemented by hydrolytic enzymes secreted into the environment to digest large organic molecules—such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids—into smaller molecules that may then be absorbed as nutrients. The vast majority of filamentous fungi grow in a polar fashion (extending in one direction) by elongation at the tip (apex) of the hypha. Other forms of fungal growth include intercalary extension (longitudinal expansion of hyphal compartments that are below the apex) {{as in the case}} of some endophytic fungi, or growth by volume expansion during the development of mushroom stipes and other large organs. Growth of fungi as multicellular structures consisting of somatic and reproductive cells—a feature independently evolved in animals and plants—has several functions, including the development of fruit bodies for dissemination of sexual spores (see above) and biofilms for substrate colonization and intercellular communication.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of AM fungi prior to root colonization, known as presymbiosis, {{consists of three}} stages: spore germination, hyphal growth, host recognition and <b>appressorium</b> formation.|$|E
500|$|The {{growth of}} fungi as hyphae on or in solid {{substrates}} or as single cells in aquatic environments is adapted for the efficient extraction of nutrients, because these growth forms have high surface area to volume ratios. Hyphae are specifically adapted for growth on solid surfaces, and to invade substrates and tissues. They can exert large penetrative mechanical forces; for example, many plant pathogens, including Magnaporthe grisea, form a structure called an <b>appressorium</b> that evolved to puncture plant tissues. The pressure {{generated by the}} <b>appressorium,</b> directed against the plant epidermis, can exceed [...] The filamentous fungus Paecilomyces lilacinus uses a similar structure to penetrate the eggs of nematodes.|$|E
2500|$|Before infecting a {{nematode}} egg, P.lilacinum flattens {{against the}} egg surface and becomes closely [...] to it. P.lilacinum produces simple appressoria {{anywhere on the}} nematode egg shell either after a few hyphae grow along the egg surface, or after a network of hyphae form on the egg. The presence of appressoria appears {{to indicate that the}} egg is, or is about to be, infected. In either case, the <b>appressorium</b> appears the same, as a simple swelling {{at the end of a}} hypha, closely appressed to the eggshell. Adhesion between the <b>appressorium</b> and nematode egg surface must be strong enough to withstand the opposing force produced by the extending tip of a penetration hypha. When the hypha has penetrated the egg, it rapidly destroys the juvenile within, before growing out of the now empty egg shell to produce conidiophores and to grow towards adjacent eggs.|$|E
2500|$|When arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungal hyphae {{encounter the}} root of a host plant, an <b>appressorium</b> or 'infection structure' forms on the root epidermis. From this structure hyphae can penetrate into the host’s parenchyma cortex. [...] AM need no chemical signals from the plant to form the appressoria. AM fungi could form appressoria on the cell walls of “ghost” cells in which the protoplast had been removed to eliminate signaling between the fungi and the plant host. However, the hyphae did not further penetrate the cells and grow in toward the root cortex, which indicates that signaling between symbionts is required for further growth once appressoria are formed.|$|E
50|$|Following spore {{attachment}} and germination on the host surface, the emerging germ tube perceives physical cues such as surface hardness and hydrophobicity, {{as well as}} chemical signals including wax monomers that trigger <b>appressorium</b> formation. <b>Appressorium</b> formation begins when {{the tip of the}} germ tube ceases polar growth, hooks, and begins to swell. The contents of the spore are then mobilized into the developing <b>appressorium,</b> a septum develops at the neck of the <b>appressorium,</b> and the germ tube and spore collapse and die. As the <b>appressorium</b> matures, it becomes firmly attached to the plant surface and a dense layer of melanin is laid down in the <b>appressorium</b> wall, except across a pore at the plant interface. Turgor pressure increases inside the <b>appressorium</b> and a penetration hyphae emerges at the pore, which is driven through the plant cuticle into the underlying epidermal cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Appressorium</b> {{development}} {{involves a}} number of steps: nuclear division, first septum formation, germling emergence, tip swelling and second septum formation. The mitosis first occurs soon after surface attachment and a nucleus from {{the second round of}} mitosis during tip swelling migrates into the hooked cell before septum formation. A mature appressoria normally contains a single nucleus. The outside plasma membrane of the mature <b>appressorium</b> is covered by a melanin layer except for the region in contact with the surface of the substratum, where the penetration peg, a specialized hyphae that penetrates the tissue surface develops. Cellular glycerol concentration sharply increases during spore germination, but it rapidly decreases at the point of <b>appressorium</b> initiation, and then gradually increases again during <b>appressorium</b> maturation. This glycerol accumulation generates high turgor pressure in the <b>appressorium,</b> and melanin is necessary for maintaining the glycerol gradient across the <b>appressorium</b> cell wall.|$|E

50|$|The spores of C. lindemuthianum are {{dispersed}} by rain splash {{and must}} quickly {{attach to the}} aerial parts of the plant in order to infect the host. A heavy rainfall may spread the spores as far as 4.5 meters from the host plant. The spore will then germinate on the new host and form a short germ tube which develops an <b>appressorium,</b> or 'pressing' organ. As the germ tube grows, it pulls the spore and the <b>appressorium</b> together, causing an indectation {{to occur in the}} cell wall. An infection peg is then able to protrude from the <b>appressorium</b> and penetrate through the cell wall. Once through the cell wall, an infection hypha grows and develops into an infection vesicle.|$|E

5000|$|Germination of the sporangia {{is usually}} {{by means of}} a germ tube which forms an <b>appressorium</b> to {{penetrate}} epidermal cells or it enters through a stoma.|$|E
50|$|Once conidia {{germinate}} on corn leaves, a germ tube differentiates {{and develops}} into an appresoria and allows C. graminicola to penetrate epidermal cells. Germination and <b>appressorium</b> formation occur {{best in the}} temperature range (15-30°C) Interestingly, penetration occurs in a much narrower temperature range (25-30°C). In order to penetrate the cell wall, the fungus first pumps melanin into {{the walls of the}} <b>appressorium</b> to create turgor pressure in the <b>appressorium.</b> The melanin allows water into the <b>appressorium</b> cell but nothing out. This builds up an incredible amount of turgor pressure which the fungus then uses to push a hyphae through the corn cell wall. This is called the penetration peg. The penetration peg then grows, extends through the cell extracting nutrients and the host cell wall dies. Hyphae migrate from epidermal cells to mesophyll cells. As a defense response, the cells produce papillae to prevent cell entry but is typically not seen successful. It is believed C. graminicola has a biotrophic phase because the plasma membrane of the epidermal cells is not immediately penetrated after invasion into the epidermal cell wall. Between 48-72 hours after infection, C. graminicola shifted from biotrophic growth to nectrotrophy (lesions appear). This is when secondary hyphae invade cell walls and intercellular spaces.|$|E
50|$|The {{attachment}} of a fungal spore on {{the surface}} of the host plant is the first critical step of infection. Once the spore is hydrated, an adhesive mucilage is released from its tip. During germination, mucilaginous substances continue to be extruded at the tips of the germ tube, which are essential for germ tube attachment and <b>appressorium</b> formation. Spore adhesion and <b>appressorium</b> formation is inhibited by hydrolytic enzymes such as α-mannosidase, α-glucosidase, and protease, suggesting that the adhesive materials are composed of glycoproteins. Germination is also inhibited at high spore concentrations, which might be due to a lipophilic self inhibitor. Self inhibition can be overcome by hydrophobic wax from rice leaf.In response to surface signals, the germ tube tip undergoes a cell differentiation process to form a specialized infection structure, the <b>appressorium.</b> Frank B. (1883), in 'Ueber einige neue und weniger bekannte Pflanzenkrankheiten', first named “appressorium” as the adhesion body which was selectively formed by the bean pathogen Gloeosporium lindemuthianum only on the host surface.|$|E
50|$|Hyaloperonospora Parasitica is an obligate biotroph, {{meaning it}} lives off a host obtaining nutrients. The {{pathogen}} infects {{about six hours}} after landing on a plant surface. The spores produce an <b>appressorium</b> which in turn produces a penetration peg. This hypha grows from bottom of the <b>appressorium</b> and works its way through an intercellular junction of two epidermal cells. As the penetration peg grows between cells, haustoria grow into the cells to gain nutrients. The Oomycete grows until it has penetrated through the entire leaf where conidiophores are then grown out of the stomata and disseminated by wind and rain.|$|E

5000|$|Appressoria are induced in {{response}} to physical cues including surface hardness and hydrophobicity, as well as chemical signals of exogenous cAMP, ethylene, the host's ripening hormone and the plant cutin monomer, hexadecanoic acid. [...] Long chain fatty acids and the tripeptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp inhibit <b>appressorium</b> induction.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>appressorium</b> is a {{specialized}} cell {{typical of many}} fungal plant pathogens {{that is used to}} infect host plants.

50|$|P. teres (teleomorph Drechslera teres) {{makes up}} to 3 conidia per conidiophore. It infects plants with an <b>appressorium.</b> It grows biotrophically {{in the first}} {{infected}} plant cell, but then switches to a necrotrophic growth mode. During necrotrophic growth the fungus can only {{be found in the}} plant apoplast but not within plant cells.|$|E
5000|$|Before infecting a {{nematode}} egg, P. lilacinum flattens {{against the}} egg surface and becomes closely [...] to it.

50|$|If weather {{conditions}} are favorable, such as warm temperatures, sporangia infect directly via germ tubes. Germ tubes {{give rise to}} <b>appressorium</b> which form haustorium and allow the pathogen to extract nutrients without penetrating the host’s cell membrane.

50|$|The {{pathogen}} infects as a spore {{that produces}} lesions or spots on {{parts of the}} rice plant such as the leaf, leaf collar, panicle, culm and culm nodes. Using a structure called an <b>appressorium,</b> the pathogen penetrates the plant. M. grisea then sporulates from the diseased rice tissue to be dispersed as conidiospores. After overwintering in sources such as rice straw and stubble, the cycle repeats.|$|E
50|$|The pyridyloxirane {{compound}} caripyrin (trans-5-(3-methyloxiranyl)pyridincarboxylic acid methyl ester) {{was isolated}} and identified from the fruit {{bodies of the}} fungus and reported in 2010. The chemical inhibits the conidial germination and <b>appressorium</b> formation of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Compared to the structurally related fungal metabolite fusaric acid, it protects plants better, but lacks cytotoxic, antibacterial, and nematicidal activity. Fruit bodies contain polysaccharides that have been shown in laboratory tests to have antiinflammatory properties.|$|E
50|$|The spores of P. teres {{are usually}} carried by wind. Growth of the {{organism}} on a host plant causes symptoms including necrosis, senescence and eventually cell death. In countries like Australia, damage from Pyrenophora can have serious economic consequences and reduce farm yields by up to 50%. Host tissue is obtained by penetration of the cell with an <b>appressorium,</b> a bulbous formation produced by the fungus that allows the uptake of nutrients.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} known for some time that the fungus can be grown in a culture. The culture is {{generally}} made of a nutrient rich agar, as the fungus generally has a hard time germinating in water due to the water solubility of the <b>appressorium.</b> For optimal growth, the culture should be kept at 22 °C and at a pH of 8, although it can be grown in temperatures between 0-34 °C and pH levels between 3-11.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} main {{physiological}} structures of DSE colonization in plant roots. The runner hyphae are individual, superficial fungal strands following the depressions between epidermal cells. The <b>appressorium</b> is the swollen structure preceding penetration through a host cell wall. The penetration tube is the thin structure penetrating through the cell wall. The microsclerotia are the intracellular groups of hyphae with rounded, thick-walled cells. The frequent inter- and intracellular structures suggest that DSE gain nutrition {{from the plant}} host.|$|E
50|$|E. turcicum causes {{disease and}} reduces yield in corn {{primarily}} by creating the necrotic lesions and reducing available leaf area for photosynthesis. Following conidia germination, the fungus forms an <b>appressorium,</b> which penetrates the corn leaf cell directly using an infection hypha. Once below the cuticle, the infection hypha produces infection pegs {{to penetrate the}} epidermal cell wall. After penetration through the cell wall, the fungus produces intracellular vesicle to obtain nutrients from the cell. After approximately 48 hours after infection, necrotic spots begin to form as the epidermal cells collapse.|$|E
50|$|A common species, R. elegans {{is found}} in rotting plant {{material}} and animal debris, as well as dung associated with soil. The fungus is a parasite of nematode eggs. When it encounters an egg, it produces hyphae that form a structure on the egg surface similar to an <b>appressorium.</b> This structure produces a narrow infection tube that penetrates the egg shell. Once inside, fungal hyphae proliferate by branching and expanding, eventually filling {{the interior of the}} egg and absorbing the nutrients within. R. elegans may be able to attack the larval and adult stages of some nematode species.|$|E
5000|$|When arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungal hyphae {{encounter the}} root of a host plant, an <b>appressorium</b> or 'infection structure' forms on the root epidermis. From this structure hyphae can penetrate into the host’s parenchyma cortex. [...] AM need no chemical signals from the plant to form the appressoria. AM fungi could form appressoria on the cell walls of “ghost” cells in which the protoplast had been removed to eliminate signaling between the fungi and the plant host. However, the hyphae did not further penetrate the cells and grow in toward the root cortex, which indicates that signaling between symbionts is required for further growth once appressoria are formed.|$|E
50|$|Rickenella is most {{similar to}} Contumyces and Blasiphalia, {{from the former}} differing by having its cystidia on the cap, stipe, and {{hymenium}} solitary and scattered. The hair-like cystidia on the cap and stipe give the small mushrooms a fuzzy appearance when viewed through a magnifying glass or hand lens. This helps to distinguish the genus from genera like Loreleia, which can be orange colored and inhabits similar sites, {{as well as other}} brightly pigmented omphalinoid genera. Rickenella does not produce massive clasping, hand-like appressoria on the rhizoids of its host, as does Blasiphalia. Instead, Rickenella produces a small <b>appressorium</b> or no appressoria and penetrates the rhizoids of its moss hosts, growing within the cells.|$|E
50|$|Alternaria alternata has {{no known}} resting sexual stage. Instead, it overwinters in {{infected}} plant debris through asexual spores called conidia. Their production can begin in {{as few as}} ten days after the first symptoms appear, and can continue for to up to fifty days. Because of this, the life cycle is known as poly-cyclic. Alternaria alternata's conidia disperse via air currents, and their release from the lesions can be triggered by rainfall, or even just a sudden increase in humidity. When the conidium lands on a leaf, it will wait until the nighttime dew, and then germinate. It can either enter through the stomata, or penetrate directly through {{the top of the}} leaf, using its <b>appressorium,</b> infecting the leaf within 12 hours.|$|E
50|$|Teleomorph of Alternaria alternata is Clathrospora diplospora. As a result, this {{pathogen}} propagates itself via asexual spores called conidia. These conidia are produced in lesions on mature or dying leaves. Their production can begin in {{as few as}} ten days after the first symptoms appear, and can continue for to up to fifty days. A. alternata’s conidia disperse via air currents, and their release from the lesions can be triggered by rainfall, or even just a sudden drop in humidity. When the conidium lands on a leaf, it will wait until the nighttime dew, and then germinate. It can either enter through the stomata, or penetrate directly through {{the top of the}} leaf, using its <b>appressorium,</b> infecting the leaf within 12 hours.|$|E
5000|$|Not much {{is known}} about the {{pathogenesis}} of P. megakarya. Like all oomycetes, zoospores produced by P. megakarya need free water on plant surfaces in order to encyst, germinate, and penetrate host tissues. A germ tube is formed during germination of the zoospore which typically gives rise to an <b>appressorium.</b> These structures penetrate the epidermal cells of the plant’s tissue and form haustoria. Haustoria invade the plant intracellularly to retrieve nutrients while further dispersing the pathogen within the host. Chlamydospores that survive in the soil produce mycelia that can also infect plant structures. [...] Infections of stems and branches lead to the formation of cankers while infections on cocoa pods cause pod rot. The development of cankers has also been associated with insects that burrow into the bark of cocoa trees.|$|E
50|$|C. gloeosporioides is a hemibiotroph, {{meaning it}} lives part way between the biotrophic and {{saprophytic}} lifestyles. The pathogen prefers a living host, {{but once the}} host tissue dies, or the pathogen finds itself surviving in the soil without a host, it can switch to a saprophytic lifestyle and feed off of dead plant material. Under correct environmental conditions, if a C. gloeosporioides conidium lands upon a susceptible host it will first produce an <b>appressorium.</b> This specialized structure allows the pathogen to penetrate the host cuticle and cell wall through {{the production of a}} penetration peg. After penetration, the pathogen produces infection vesicles which invaginate the cell membrane, and drain nutrients from the plant. Later in the pathogen’s life cycle when the host’s infected fruit or foliar flesh dies, the pathogen switches to the saprophytic life cycle to feed off of the dead tissue.|$|E
5000|$|This is a {{polycyclic}} pathogen with {{a sexual}} and an asexual stage. It thrives in cool moist environments. Over {{winter in the}} soil, oospores survive and wait for spring. In warmer conditions {{when it gets to}} about 47-53 degrees F the oospores will germinate and produce an <b>appressorium</b> or form a short germ tube. The mycelium grows intracellularly and haustoria penetrate through the host cells when the temperature is around 60 degrees F. After about 1-2 weeks when the temperature is between 60-64 degrees F, conidiophores (the asexual stage) will form out of the plant stomata bearing conidia. Sporulation occurs at night. The conidia disseminate in high humidity mornings when it’s about 50-60 degrees. [...] Meanwhile during the sexual stage, the antheridia (the male sex organ) fertilizes the oogonium (the female sex organ) with a fertilization tube and an oospore is developed.|$|E
