25|$|Petroglyphs are {{engravings}} or carvings {{into the}} rock panel. They are created {{with the use of}} a hard hammerstone, which is battered <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> surface. In certain societies, the choice of hammerstone itself has religious significance. In other instances, the rock art is pecked out through indirect percussion, as a second rock is used like a chisel between the hammerstone and the panel. A third, rarer form of engraving rock art was through incision, or scratching, into the surface of the stone with a lithic flake or metal blade. The motifs produced using this technique are fine-lined and often difficult to see.|$|E
25|$|The opening match saw the semi-regular team of Sombra de Plata and Ricky Marvin faced off <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> brothers, {{also known}} as Los Bellos Stone (Chris and Alan Stone). Sombra de Plata and Marvin began working as a regular team in mid-1999 where their matches against Fugaz and Sangre Azteca in match that stole the show, earning four wrestlers {{standing}} ovations from the crowds. The success of this match earned all four a match at CMLL's biggest show of the year the CMLL 66th Anniversary Show, which took place on September 24, 1999. This time Marvin and Sombra de Plata won the match. At the following year's CMLL 67th Anniversary Show Sombra de Plata teamed up with Mano Negra Jr. as they lost to Los Bello Stone. For the December 2000 show Sombra de Plata teamed up with his regular partner Marvin {{to take on the}} Stone brothers.|$|E
500|$|Less {{than a month}} later, Pei {{suspended}} {{his work}} at Harvard to join the National Defense Research Committee, which coordinated scientific research into US weapons technology during World WarII. Pei's background in architecture {{was seen as a}} considerable asset; one member of the committee told him: [...] "If you know how to build you should also know how to destroy." [...] The fight against Germany was ending, so he focused on the Pacific War. The US realized that its bombs used <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> buildings of Europe would be ineffective against Japanese cities, mostly constructed from wood and paper; Pei was assigned to work on incendiary bombs. Pei spent {{two and a half years}} with the NDRC, but has revealed few details.|$|E

500|$|O'Hara began 1941 by {{appearing}} in They Met in Argentina, RKO's answer to Down Argentine Way (1940). O'Hara later declared that she [...] "knew {{it was going}} to be a stinker; terrible script, bad director, preposterous plot, forgettable music". She grew increasingly frustrated with the direction of her career at this time. Ida Zeitlin wrote that O'Hara had [...] "reached a pitch of despair where she was about ready to throw in the towel, to break her contract, to collapse <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> wall of indifference and howl like a baby wolf". She pleaded with her agent for a role, however small, in John Ford's upcoming film How Green Was My Valley (1941), at 20th Century Fox, a film about a close, hard-working Welsh mining family living in the heart of the South Wales Valleys in the 19th century. The film, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, began an artistic collaboration with Ford that would span 20 years and five feature films.|$|E
2500|$|In {{early winter}} Lake Superior's waves {{splashing}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> {{tower of the}} Stannard Rock Light built a layer of ice that forced maintenance crews to hack away the ice around the door to reach the men. If an illness, accident, or fire occurred at the Stannard Rock Light it could be days or even weeks before the keepers got assistance. As one of the rock lighthouses, it was designated as a [...] "stag station" [...] where only men could serve without their families. The keepers called the Stannard Rock Light the [...] "Loneliest Place in the World" [...] and it has always carried {{the distinction of being}} the [...] "loneliest place" [...] in the continental United States. Maritime historian Wes Oleszwski reported that duty at the Stannard Rock Light was so rough that of the keepers and assistant keepers, there were four resignations and three transfers in the first three seasons of the station's operation.|$|E
2500|$|Continuing {{on its way}} {{downstream}} to Johnstown, [...] west, {{the water}} picked up debris, such as trees, houses, and animals. At the Conemaugh Viaduct, a [...] high railroad bridge, the flood was momentarily stemmed when this debris jammed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> bridge's arch. But within seven minutes, the viaduct collapsed, allowing the flood to resume its course. However, owing to the delay at the stone arch, the flood waters gained renewed hydraulic head, resulting in a stronger, more abrupt wave of water hitting places downstream than {{otherwise would have been}} expected. The small town of Mineral Point, [...] below the Conemaugh Viaduct, was the first populated place to be hit with this renewed force. About 30 families lived on the village's single street. After the flood, there were no structures, no topsoil, no sub-soil – only the bedrock was left. The death toll here was approximately 16 people. In 2009, studies showed that the flood's flow rate through the narrow valley exceeded , comparable to the flow rate of the Mississippi River at its delta, which varies between [...]|$|E

2500|$|At Johnstown, the Stone Bridge, {{which was}} a {{substantial}} arched structure, carried the Pennsylvania Railroad across the Conemaugh River. The debris carried by the flood formed a temporary dam at the bridge, resulting in the flood surge rolling upstream along the Stoney Creek River. Eventually, gravity caused the surge {{to return to the}} dam, causing a second wave to hit the city, but from a different direction. Some people who had been washed downstream became trapped in an inferno as the debris piled up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> Bridge caught fire; at least 80 people died there. The fire at the Stone Bridge burned for three days. After floodwaters receded, the pile of debris at the bridge was seen to cover , and reached [...] in height. It took workers three months to remove the mass of debris, the delay owing in part to the huge quantity of steel barbed wire from the ironworks. Dynamite was eventually used. Still standing and in use as a railroad bridge, the Stone Bridge is a landmark associated with survival and recovery from the flood. In 2008, it was restored in a project including new lighting as part of commemorative activities related to the flood.|$|E

60|$|Then {{the grip}} of Mr. Polly's fingers gave, and he hit his chin <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> and slipped clumsily to the ground again, {{scraping}} his cheek <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall and hurting his shin <b>against</b> <b>the</b> log by which he had reached the top.
