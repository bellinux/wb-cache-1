5|$|Lexus has {{not sold}} {{as well in}} Europe, where it suffers from smaller brand recognition, image, and a less-developed {{dealership}} network. In European markets, the Lexus LS has ranked behind Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and BMW in flagship luxury car sales. Automotive analysts have suggested a possible rationale for the sales disparity, in that European buyers place less emphasis on vehicle reliability and have more brand loyalty to established domestic marques. In contrast, the Lexus LS has ranked second in sales to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (<b>and</b> <b>ahead</b> of rivals from BMW, Audi, and Jaguar) in markets outside Europe, such as South Africa.|$|E

5|$|Rainbands spawned near <b>and</b> <b>ahead</b> of cold fronts can be squall lines {{which are}} able to produce tornadoes.

Bands of thunderstorms can form with sea breeze and land breeze boundaries, if enough moisture is present. If sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front, they can mask the location of the cold front itself.|$|E
