40|$|Domestic sewage {{contains}} important nutrients for {{the growth}} of plants and is used for aquaculture in several parts of the world. The campus of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur generates 14. 29 lakh liters day- 1 of sewage. Only 17 % of the total sewage is going to the existing ponds while the remaining 83 % is wasted due to leakage in the underground drainage system. There is a possibility of pollution of soil and ground water around the IIT, Kharagpur campus. A study was initiated to assess the present situation and to design a sewage-fed <b>aquaculture</b> <b>farm</b> on the campus. The area was physically surveyed, soil samples and meteorological data collected and analysed. Based on the collected information, a model of sewage-fed <b>aquaculture</b> <b>farm</b> was designed. This would utilize the nutrients present in the sewage and would reduce the risk of pollution of soil and ground water in the area. The data collected from the proposed sewage treatment <b>aquaculture</b> <b>farm</b> show that the desired dissolved oxygen level (> 5 mg/l) was achieved on 4 th day from 1 mg/l, COD concentration (< 50 mg/l) on 6 th day from 350 mg/l, TSS (80 mg/l) on 5 th day from 350 mg/l, BOD concentration (< 20 mg/l) on 6 th day from 180 mg/l and ammonium-nitrogen concentration (0. 2 - 3 mg/l) was achieved on 5 th day.

In {{order to meet the}} technology requirements of water-quality monitoring in multi-parameter, dynamic, and networked monitoring, a water- quality dynamic monitoring system was developed to monitor multi-parameter water-quality variables such as water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, oxidation reduction potential dynamically, and communicate with remote information servers in a high security. As result of a two-years testing experiment in a seawater aquiculture company, relative errors of each water-quality parameter measured by the instrument were less than 5 %, data lost percentage of remote communication was less than 3 %, and power energy consumption was less than 13 W. Therefore, the water-quality dynamic monitoring system as a node infrastructure of wireless sensor networks can be used to achieve a distributed water-quality network monitoring system in a large-scale <b>aquaculture</b> <b>farm,</b> or to construct a distributed water-quality monitoring network system in multipoint of different cities for <b>aquaculture</b> <b>farm</b> and administration section...|$|E

And also, turtle positions can also be used for routing and networking purposes in such a large-scale surveillance WSNs. Of course, the straightforward method for localization in WSNs is to use Global Positioning System (GPS) [7], attached on every sensor node. However, it is infeasible for large-scale aquaculture monitoring WSNs equipped GPS receiver on every node, which brings about so much high cost or inconvenience.|$|E
