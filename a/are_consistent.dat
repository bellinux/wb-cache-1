40|$|We {{introduce}} a natural generalization of Borel 2 ̆ 7 s Conjecture. For each infinite cardinal number κ, let BCκ denote this generalization.

Using the connection of BCκ with a generalization of Kurepa 2 ̆ 7 s Hypothesis, we obtain the following consistency results: 1. If it <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> that there <b>is</b> a 1 -inaccessible cardinal then it <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> that BCℵ 1. 2.

Two theories are equiconsistent if each one <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> {{relative to the}} other.|$|R

5|$|The site of S.iniae {{infection}} and its clinical presentation vary from species to species.

The assumption that ZF <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>is</b> harmless because adding another axiom to an already inconsistent system cannot make the situation worse.
