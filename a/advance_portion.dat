5|$|By mid-January Captain García de Paredes {{had arrived}} at the <b>advance</b> <b>portion</b> of the Camino Real at Chuntuki. By now he only had 90 {{soldiers}} plus labourers and porters. Captain Pedro de Zubiaur, García’s senior officer, arrived at Lake Petén Itza with 60 musketeers, two Franciscans, and allied Yucatec Maya warriors. They were also accompanied by about 40 Maya porters. They were approached by about 300 canoes carrying approximately 2,000 Itza warriors. The warriors began to mingle freely with the Spanish party and a scuffle then broke out; a dozen of the Spanish party were forced into canoes, and three of them were killed. At this point the Spanish soldiers opened fire with their muskets, and the Itza retreated across the lake with their prisoners, who included the two Franciscans. The Spanish party retreated from the lake shore and regrouped on open ground where they were surrounded by thousands of Itza warriors. Zubiaur ordered his men to fire a volley that killed between 30 and 40 Itzas. Realising that they were hopelessly outnumbered, the Spanish retreated towards Chuntuki, abandoning their captured companions to their fate.|$|E

García despatched two Kejache scouts to the lakeshore to discover Avendaño's whereabouts; at the same time Avendaño's Kejache guides were returning to Chuntuki from Nojpetén with news of Avendaño's flight. The Itzas at the lake handed over an open letter written by Avendaño before his departure from Nojpetén as a token of friendship between the Itza and the Spanish.

2500|$|According to legend, Hanina {{was very}} poor. Indeed, it became proverbial that, while {{the whole world}} was {{provided}} for through Hanina's great merits, he himself sustained life from one Sabbath eve to another on a basket of carob beans. For some time the outside world had been kept in ignorance of his privations; his wife did all that was possible to maintain an appearance of comfort, and though she had no flour with which to make dough, she would put fuel into the oven every Friday and cause columns of smoke to rise, thus making her neighbors believe that, like them, she was baking the Sabbath meals. In time, however, one woman's suspicion was aroused, and she determined to surprise Hanina's wife and discover the truth. But, according to the legend, a miracle prevented exposure. When the woman appeared at Hanina's house and looked into the smoking oven it was full of loaves. In spite of the miracle, Hanina's wife induced him to collect from heaven an <b>advance</b> <b>portion</b> of his future lot. Hanina complied with her request, and, in answer to his prayer, a golden table-leg was miraculously sent him. Husband and wife were happy; but that night the wife had a vision of heaven in which she saw the saints feasting at three-legged tables while her husband's table had only two legs. She awoke full of regret at the importunity which had deprived his table of a leg, and insisted that he pray for the withdrawal of the treasure. This he did, and the golden leg disappeared. Of this supposed miracle the Talmud says: [...] "It was greater than the former, since heaven gives, but never takes" [...] (Ta'anit, 24b et seq.).|$|E

40|$|S- 20098 has potent and {{specific}} agonist properties on melatonin receptors both in vitro and in vivo. Behavioral studies on rodents already showed that repeated intraperitoneal administration of S- 20098 could dose-dependently alter {{the functioning of}} the circadian clock. To determine whether single administration of S- 20098 could alter the circadian rhythms of rodents, we first used the phase-response curve (PRC) approach in two different species: Syrian hamsters and mice (C 3 H/HeJ). Our results show that the shape, circadian times and extent of the PRC to S- 20098 look very similar in mice and hamsters. In both species, the phase <b>advance</b> <b>portion</b> of the PRC to S- 20098 is limited to a 3 h window preceding the onset of locomotor activity, but the magnitude of phase shifts is larger in mice. We also tested the phase shifting effects of increasing doses of S- 20098 during the interval of maximal sensitivity to this compound. Treatment with S- 20098 induces dose-dependent phase shifts, with maximal shifts observed after injections of 20 and 25 mg/kg S- 20098 i. p. respectively, in mice and hamsters. Those results are in agreement with the limited distribution of melatonin-binding sites within the circadian clock of adult Syrian hamsters, as compared to other rodents.

40|$|Exogenous {{melatonin}} {{is increasingly}} used for its phase shifting and soporific effects. We generated a three pulse phase response curve (PRC) to exogenous melatonin (3 mg) by administering it to free-running subjects. Young healthy subjects (n = 27) participated in two 5 day laboratory sessions, each preceded {{by at least}} a week of habitual, but fixed sleep. Each 5 day laboratory session started and ended with a phase assessment to measure the circadian rhythm of endogenous melatonin in dim light using 30 min saliva samples. In between were three days in an ultradian dim light (< 150 lux) –dark cycle (LD 2. 5 : 1. 5) during which each subject took one pill per day at the same clock time (3 mg melatonin or placebo, double blind, counterbalanced). Each individual's phase shift to exogenous melatonin was corrected by subtracting their phase shift to placebo (a free-run). The resulting PRC has a phase <b>advance</b> <b>portion</b> peaking about 5 h before the dim light melatonin onset, in the afternoon. The phase delay portion peaks about 11 h after the dim light melatonin onset, shortly after the usual time of morning awakening. A dead zone of minimal phase shifts occurred around the first half of habitual sleep. The fitted maximum advance and delay shifts were 1. 8 h and 1. 3 h, respectively. This new PRC will aid in determining the optimal time to administer exogenous melatonin to achieve desired phase shifts and demonstrates that using exogenous melatonin as a sleep aid at night has minimal phase shifting effects...|$|E

As the drop moves along the surface, the <b>advancing</b> <b>portion</b> of the contact line simply lies down onto the upcoming roughness features, contributing negligibly to adhesion. After measuring the local receding contact angle of capillary bridges formed on a micropillar array, we find that these depinning events follow the Gibbs depinning criterion. We further extend this technique to two-scale hierarchical structures to reveal a self-similar depinning mechanism in which the adhesion of the entire drop depends only on the pinning at the very smallest level of roughness hierarchy. With this self-similar depinning mechanism we develop a model to predict the adhesion of drops to superhydrophobic surfaces that explains both the low adhesion on sparsely structured surfaces and the surprisingly high adhesion on surfaces whose features are densely spaced or tortuously shaped.

40|$|AbstractAs a {{model of}} the {{pathological}} sinus node of the heart, systems of pacemaker cells coupled by the phase response curve (PRC) were constructed. Computer simulations were performed in coupled two pacemakers, in a chain of pacemakers and in a sheet of pacemakers. Three types of pathological modes of oscillation were recognized: focal tachycardia, circus movement tachycardia and disrhythmia. Focal tachycardia was generated between two pacemakers coupled by PRCs in a specific condition, giving rise to a uniform, tachycardic synchrony over the whole network. Circus movement tachycardia was shown to occur even in a uniform network if elements of the network had a PRC with reduced amplitude and the initial phases were chosen appropriately. Such a circus movement tachycardia could be changed into the other mode of circus movement or could be stopped, by application of extrasystolic inputs. Disrhythmia, which was interpreted as a nonperiodic mode of oscillation of the network, could be generated when the elements of the network had a PRC with a negative slope between the delay and <b>advance</b> <b>portions,</b> and when they had inhomogenity in their intrinsic periods...|$|R
