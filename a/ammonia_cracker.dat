50|$|In 1997 {{he became}} {{vice-president}} of Apollo Energy Systems, and was tasked with the continued development of fuel cells. His research continued at TU Graz on fuel cell electrode performance, low-cost {{fuel cell stack}} design, propulsion fuel (NH3), and an <b>ammonia</b> <b>cracker.</b> He was gratified to see the electric car and the hybrid-electric make a comeback in his last years. He was 40 years early with the electric hybrid vehicles that he enjoyed building and driving.|$|E
40|$|Design an {{alkaline}} {{fuel cell}} system with circulating electrolyte for intermittent duty service and small units operating in a hybrid mode. • Develop and optimize a low-cost <b>ammonia</b> <b>cracker</b> for supplying hydrogen as gas. • Use liquid fuels like methanol or boro-hydrides in alkaline electrolytes. • Replace the presently-used Pt catalysts if possible at cathodes and anodes. • Demonstrate that these systems work like zinc-air cells with replaceable anodes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{describes}} a stand-alone PV/UFC/battery based hybrid {{power generation system}} that consists of a PV generator and a urine-fueled fuel cell (UFC) system, and an electricity storage/supply device in parallel to meet the daily load demand. The urine treatment process combined with <b>ammonia</b> <b>cracker</b> is designed to produce high-purity hydrogen. The optimization and simulation of urine-to-H 2 processor is investigated. To find a feasible operating scenario, the hybrid power management strategy according to daily load demand, daily solar irradiance, charge/discharge mechanism for battery and external energy burdens is considered as an economic power dispatch problem...|$|E
