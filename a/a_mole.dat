40|$|Si-doped InAsxP 1 -x layers with <b>As</b> <b>mole</b> {{fractions}} {{ranging from}} 0. 05 to 0. 50 were grown on InAsxP 1 -x step-graded buffer layers on InP substrates by solid source molecular beam epitaxy. The growth parameters {{consisted of a}} P:In flux ratio of 7 : 1, {{a growth temperature of}} ~ 485 oC, a growth rate of 2. 2 Å/s, and an As:In flux ratio of 0. 37 - 2. 36 for varying <b>As</b> <b>mole</b> fractions. The <b>As</b> <b>mole</b> fraction and the layer relaxation were determined using triple axis x-ray diffraction measurements. Near complete relaxation (> 93 %) was achieved for all Si-doped InAsxP 1 -x epilayers. The structural morphology indicated that the InAsxP 1 -x graded buffer layers were effective in relieving the lattice mismatch strain as evidenced by a well-developed crosshatch morphology and low rms surface roughness. The electron concentration, mobility, and Si donor activation energy for each InAsxP 1 -x composition were determined using temperature dependent Hall measurements. At a constant electron carrier concentration of ~ 3. 5 x 1016 cm- 3, the 300 K carrier mobility increased from 2700 to 4732 cm 2 /V-sec with increasing <b>As</b> <b>mole</b> fraction fro...|$|R

Simultaneously, the base experiences a power outage, and confusion ensues, with neither Haddock nor Wolff capable of explaining clearly what happened.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{previous}} actions of breaking into ISIS and hacking the mainframe, Archer is excused from his expenses after Cyril {{comes to the}} assumption that Kremenski had been stealing from Archer's account the whole time.

5|$|In April 1987 Reagan {{appointed}} Matlock as Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Conditions at the Embassy were tense, as Marine Sergeant Clayton Lonetree {{had been}} found to have compromised Embassy security. Within a few months of the Lonetree scandal, all U.S. intelligence assets in the Soviet Union had been exposed. The Americans suspected that the security breach had meant that the Embassy code room was no longer secure and worked frantically to determine how. It was not until 1994 that Aldrich Ames, <b>a</b> <b>mole</b> within the CIA, was caught. Another mole, Robert Hanssen, this time within the FBI, was caught only in 2001.|$|E

The book alleged that MI6 had infiltrated the German Bundesbank with <b>a</b> <b>mole,</b> and that the Service had a special means of writing in invisible ink. Other revelations were already public knowledge, such as that MI6 recruits are trained at Fort Monckton in Hampshire, and that agents in the field often use the cover of being a journalist.|$|E
5|$|Lee made Sally's Beauty Spot, a 12-minute-long {{short film}} {{focusing}} on <b>a</b> <b>mole</b> on her sister's right breast, {{for a film}} editing class at NYU in 1990. For the film she used a second-hand Bolex camera and edited it with a Steenbeck editing suite. She later recalled that she recorded the film while in her pyjamas. The production cost a total of $4,000. Fellow Canadian filmmaker David Weaver described it as sexualizing Sally's body, something that Lee had not intended. The film was first screened at the Festival of Festivals in Toronto. After graduation, Lee spent time as a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art before returning to Canada.|$|E
30|$|The {{diagnosis}} of <b>a</b> hydatidiform <b>mole</b> {{depends upon the}} correlation of clinical and pathological features, including a persistently elevated beta-hCG, histological features and DNA flow cytometric analysis to determine ploidy. Nonmolar hydropic abortions are common {{and it is important}} to distinguish molar pregnancies from nonmolar hydropic changes, because molar pregnancies can cause persistent trophoblastic disease. In cases of doubt regarding the type of molar pregnancy, DNA flow cytometric analysis is valuable. It must be emphasized that DNA flow cytometry is the only method in distinguishing <b>a</b> diploid <b>mole</b> from <b>a</b> triploid <b>mole</b> once the {{diagnosis of}} molar pregnancy has been confirmed histologically [1]. In our case, the histological examination revealed <b>a</b> hydatidiform <b>mole,</b> which was confirmed by DNA ploidy analysis revealing triploidy (69, XXY) after the cytogenetic examination.|$|R

When the identity connects it to one of the employees at the facility where the Fringe mainframe is housed, Broyles suspects <b>a</b> <b>mole</b> seeking to wipe out Fauxlivia's data, and orders a mainframe lockdown, while verifying the humanity of key people in the FBI and Massive Dynamic. Astrid identifies several other potential candidates, including a doctor from Massive Dynamic who had already left. By the time Fringe division reaches his home, they find the man, a shapeshifter, already dead.|$|E

After he investigates extraterrestrial cases at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, Mulder is given a new partner, Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), and meets a secretive informant, X (Steven Williams). Mulder is recruited to assist in a hostage negotiation when Duane Barry, an alien abductee, captures four people. Barry eventually kidnaps Scully, believing that if he brings her to his original abduction site, Skyland Mountain, aliens will take her instead of him. Mulder follows but is delayed by Krycek, who is revealed to be <b>a</b> <b>mole</b> working for Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). When Mulder reaches Skyland Mountain, Scully is gone. Barry, who insists that aliens took him, dies soon after an interrogation by Krycek. When Krycek vanishes, Skinner re-opens the X-Files, claiming {{that is what the}} conspirators will fear most.|$|E
5|$|Davis is acquitted, but Freamon {{uses the}} threat of federal {{prosecution}} to blackmail him for information. Davis reveals Maurice Levy has <b>a</b> <b>mole</b> in the courthouse from whom he illegally purchases copies of sealed indictments. Herc tells Levy that the Stanfield case was probably based on an illegal wiretap, something which would jeopardize the entire case. After Levy reveals this to Pearlman, she uses Levy's espionage to blackmail him into agreeing to a plea bargain for his defendants. Levy ensures Stanfield's release {{on the condition that}} he permanently retires, while his subordinates will have to accept long sentences. Stanfield sells the connection to The Greeks back to the Co-Op and plans to become a businessman, although he appears unable or unwilling to stay off the corner.|$|E

As union leader, Sobotka has taken it on himself to reinvigorate the port by lobbying politicians to support much-needed infrastructure improvement initiatives.

Around him, his son and nephew also turn to crime, as they have few other opportunities to earn money. It becomes clear to the Sobotka detail that the dead girls are related to their investigation, as they were in a container {{that was supposed to be}} smuggled through the port. They again use wiretaps to infiltrate the crime ring and slowly work their way up the chain towards The Greek, the mysterious man in charge.
