And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Being a {{professional}} wrestling championship, it was won via a scripted ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler {{because of a}} storyline. All title changes occurred at JCP or WCW-promoted events. The inaugural champion was Danny Miller, who defeated Ole Anderson on February 27, 1974, in the finals of a tournament. Booker T holds the record for most reigns, with six. Rick Steamboat's second reign ended due to vacancy for unknown reasons. The day on which the reign ended is also unknown, although {{it is known that}} the reign began on June 10, 1978, <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> close sometime in 1980. As such, if the reign ended on January 1, 1980, or any later time during 1980, then Steamboat's second reign is the longest in the title's history, at over 570 days. Five different reigns are tied for the record for shortest reign in the title's history, at one day.|$|E

50|$|PA 309 {{becomes a}} four-lane freeway called the Fort Washington Expressway <b>and</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> diamond {{interchange}} with the southern terminus of PA 152 at Easton Road. From here, the route heads northwest and passes {{to the southwest}} of Arcadia University before it runs near wooded areas and suburban residential development, crossing into Springfield Township. The freeway curves west <b>and</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> interchange at Paper Mill Road, where it makes <b>a</b> turn <b>to</b> the northwest. PA 309 reaches a diamond interchange with PA 73 and continues through suburban areas, crossing into Whitemarsh Township and heading north as it passes near business parks. The route heads north-northeast <b>and</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bridge over SEPTA's Lansdale/Doylestown Line before it bends north and passes under Norfolk Southern's Morrisville Line. PA 309 enters Upper Dublin Township <b>and</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276) and Pennsylvania Avenue in Fort Washington. From here, the freeway passes near business parks before heading north-northwest through wooded residential areas, coming <b>to</b> <b>an</b> interchange with Highland Avenue. The route heads north through more suburban development {{to the east of}} the borough of Ambler <b>and</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> northbound exit <b>and</b> southbound entrance at Susquehanna Road.

The freeway runs through woodland and residential development, crossing into Lower Gwynedd Township and turning north <b>to</b> reach <b>a</b> diamond interchange serving Norristown Road to the east of Spring House. The route runs near business parks and curves northwest, heading near residential development before it reaches {{the north end of the}} Fort Washington Expressway and merges onto Bethlehem Pike, with a southbound exit and northbound entrance for Bethlehem Pike.|$|R
5|$|Guidelines {{issued by}} the UK-based National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), carried out a {{systematic}} review using different methodology <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> different conclusion. They questioned the accuracy of studies that were not placebo-controlled. And, {{based on the findings}} of placebo-controlled studies, they do not recommend use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks, as tolerance and physical dependence develop rapidly, with withdrawal symptoms including rebound anxiety occurring after six weeks or more of use. Nevertheless, benzodiazepines are still prescribed for long-term treatment of anxiety disorders, although specific antidepressants and psychological therapies are recommended as the first-line treatment options with the anticonvulsant drug pregabalin indicated as a second- or third-line treatment and suitable for long-term use. NICE stated that long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia is an unlicensed indication, does not have long-term efficacy, and is, therefore, not recommended by clinical guidelines. Psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy are recommended as a first-line therapy for panic disorder; benzodiazepine use has been found to interfere with therapeutic gains from these therapies.|$|E
5|$|In 1535, the abbey's {{income was}} only {{assessed}} at £155 in the Valor Ecclesiasticus, Henry VIII's great survey of church finances. It meant {{the following year}} that it came {{under the terms of}} the first Suppression Act, Henry's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Abbot William Dovell and his 16monks were forced to surrender the abbey on 6 September 1536. There were proposals from local gentry and even some of the king's officials for the Dissolution such as Sir Thomas Arundell that Cleeve should be granted a reprieve, as a number of others among the smaller monasteries were, however, it was not to be and the monks finally left in the spring of 1537. Abbot William was given a pension of 40marks per year, not large but certainly comfortable, which he was still drawing 20years later. Most of the other monks were given pensions too. One former monk of Cleeve rose to prominence <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sticky end. This was John Hooper who became Bishop of Gloucester and Worcester and was killed in 1555 for his Protestant beliefs by Mary I.|$|E
5|$|Macartney's {{omission}} {{was part}} of the most infamous disputes in Australian cricket history and led to a fracas. Australian captain and selector Clem Hill wanted to include Macartney for the Third Test, but another member of the panel, former player Peter McAlister objected and said that Hill should omit himself if he wanted Macartney to play. Tensions between the two selectors were high, <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> head in a selection meeting ahead of the Fourth Test. McAlister criticised Hill's tactics and policies towards his bowlers, provoking an exchange of insults regarding the other's leadership ability. Hill then bloodied McAlister with a powerful blow to the nose and the ensuing brawl lasted between 10 and 20 minutes. Furniture was knocked across the room, artwork shattered and Hill had to be restrained from throwing McAlister out of the third floor window, before resigning as a selector.|$|E

5|$|Newsweek {{verbally}} accepted Hensmann's {{offer and}} he in turn informed Murdoch, {{giving him the}} option to raise his bid. Murdoch was furious, having considered the handshake agreement in Zürich final. On 15 April 1983 Murdoch, with Mark Edmiston, the president of Newsweek, met Schulte-Hillen, who, unexpectedly and without explanation, went back on all the previous verbal—and therefore, to his mind, non-binding—agreements and told them the price was now $4.25million. Murdoch and Edmiston refused to accede to the new price and both left. The managers of Stern, with no publishing partners, backtracked on their statements <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> second deal with Murdoch, who drove the price down, paying $800,000 for the US rights, and $400,000 for the British and Australian rights. Further deals were done in France with Paris Match for $400,000; in Spain with Grupo Zeta for $150,000; in the Netherlands for $125,000; in Norway for $50,000; and in Italy with Panorama for $50,000. Newsweek did not enter into a deal and instead based their subsequent stories on the copies of the diaries they had seen during the negotiation period.|$|E

The association was officially launched on 1 July 1967, the 100th anniversary of Canadian Confederation, with Governor General Roland Michener being the first inductee to the order—to the level of Companion—and on 7 July of the same year, 90 more people were appointed, including Vincent Massey, Louis St. Laurent, Hugh MacLennan, David Bauer, Gabrielle Roy, Donald Creighton, Thérèse Casgrain, Wilder Penfield, Arthur Lismer, M. J. Coldwell, Edwin Baker, Alex Colville, and Maurice Richard. During a visit to London, United Kingdom, later in 1970, Michener presented the Queen with her Sovereign's badge for the Order of Canada, which she first wore during a banquet in Yellowknife in July 1970.|$|E
