5|$|<b>Additional</b> <b>requirements</b> {{are imposed}} by Article V, Section I, {{paragraph}} 10 {{of the state}} constitution, which provides that the lieutenant governor be appointed as a head of a cabinet-level department or administrative agency within the governor's administration, with the exception {{that he or she}} cannot be the state's attorney general. The current lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, serves as New Jersey's 33rd Secretary of State.|$|E
5|$|Labour difficulties, late {{delivery}} of equipment, <b>additional</b> <b>requirements</b> for Australian operations, and the prioritisation of merchant shipping over naval construction delayed {{the completion of}} Majestic. Incorporation of the new systems and enhancements caused {{the cost of the}} RAN carrier acquisition program to increase to AU£8.3million. Construction and fitting out did not finish until October 1955. As the carrier neared completion, a commissioning crew was formed in Australia and first used to return Vengeance to the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Positive {{train control}} became a Federal mandate {{with the passing}} of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008. After review, the FRA waiver was granted in May 2010, marking the first time lighter-weight EMUs were allowed to share rails with freight in the United States. The grant was {{conditioned}} on meeting nine <b>additional</b> <b>requirements,</b> including demonstrating minimum crashworthiness, seating, improving grade crossing, meeting FRA positive train control standards in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 236 with CBOSS, formalizing the temporal separation plan, and issuing a safety system program.|$|E
5|$|The {{convergence}} of both series has very different properties. Even if the Taylor series has positive convergence radius, the resulting series may not {{coincide with the}} function; but if the function is analytic then the series converges pointwise to the function, and uniformly on every compact subset of the convergence interval. Concerning the Fourier series, if the function is square-integrable then the series converges in quadratic mean, but <b>additional</b> <b>requirements</b> are needed to ensure the pointwise or uniform convergence (for instance, if the function is periodic and of class C1 then the convergence is uniform).|$|E
5|$|Viva Piñata is a first-person life {{simulation}} game {{in which}} the player restores and tends to a neglected garden on Piñata Island. The player uses gardening tools, such as shovels and watering cans, to plough their garden, sow seeds, create ponds, and sculpt the garden to their liking. When certain requirements are fulfilled, the garden will attract a black-and-white outline of a given piñata species. After fulfilling <b>additional</b> <b>requirements,</b> the piñata will become a resident, changing into a full-color version.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difficult}} area was feats. Although common feats worked well, with a random {{chance of success}} or failure, uncommon ones would appear to fail more often. To avoid this, randomization {{was replaced by a}} degree of difficulty in accomplishing the feat. Although pen-and-paper falling damage is random, the computer game bases damage on the distance of the fall. The team's biggest challenge was adapting disciplines. The pen-and-paper version may require a little blood that requires a long time to use, or have no blood cost and can be used at will; upgraded disciplines had <b>additional</b> <b>requirements</b> considered too confusing for a computer game. Troika attempted to equalize the disciplines, keeping the effect intact and normalizing the cost, so a first-level power requires one blood point, a second-level two points and so on. To balance the clans, the aristocratic Ventrue were only allowed to feed on noble blood, though this was changed to allow them to feed on lower-class humans, receiving less blood. During character creation, the game had an optional character biography with unique positive and negative characteristics (increasing one ability while limiting another). This was removed from the released game; Activision felt that there was insufficient test time, and removing it was a more stable option.|$|E

Underwriters Laboratories maintains UL Standard 498, which specifies construction performance (e.g.: durability, electrical safety, and fire-resistance) for NEMA connectors. These <b>additional</b> <b>requirements</b> allow connectors to be manufactured {{to be compliant with}} the National Electrical Code. The Defense Logistics Agency and General Services Administration maintain Federal Specification W-C-596 and its associated specification sheets. This specification references WD-6 and UL498, and provides additional durability and electrical safety performance criteria for connectors intended for military use.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s the {{expansion}} of the Finnish icebreaker fleet allowed navigation in more severe ice conditions, and the Finnish ice class rules published in 1965 introduced a new ice class, 1A Super, which was considerably stronger than the existing classes. Since ice class 1A was already exempted from the ice fees, the 50% reduction to lighthouse fees was given to ships of the new ice class. However, the <b>additional</b> <b>requirements</b> of the highest ice class were deemed excessive and only three such ships were built.|$|E
