25|$|There are a {{range of}} genetic and {{environmental}} risk factors for developing an addiction that vary across the population. Roughly half of an individual's risk for developing an addiction is derived from genetics, while the other half {{is derived from the}} environment. However, even in individuals with a relatively low genetic loading, exposure to sufficiently high doses of an addictive drug {{for a long period of}} time (e.g., weeks–months) can result in an addiction. In other words, anyone can become <b>an</b> <b>addict</b> under the right circumstances.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Stoltenberg {{went into}} more detail {{about how she}} {{started out as a}} drug addict, to TV {{journalist}} Tonje Steinsland–the second time her life as <b>an</b> <b>addict</b> {{was the subject of a}} television special. It started in 1991, when she was 27. She witnessed two drug addicts in a fight in a cafe in Oslo when something fell out of the pocket of one of them. She picked it up and saw that it was heroin. Together with her boyfriend she went home and decided to snort the drug. For the next three years she was an intravenous drug user. By the end of the 1990s, she was close to dying. In the interview, Stoltenberg also tells of a boyfriend who subjected her to punishments, psychological terror and much fear, however, the heroin turned all of that into a feeling of freedom and made her perceive their relationship as simply wonderful, for a while.|$|E

25|$|In August 1998 {{taxi driver}} John Shaw, from Hyde, {{contacted}} the police, informing {{them that he}} suspected Shipman of murdering 21 of his patients. Grundy's daughter, lawyer Angela Woodruff, became concerned when solicitor Brian Burgess informed her that a will had been made, apparently by her mother. There were doubts about its authenticity. The will excluded her and her children, but left £386,000 to Shipman. Burgess told Woodruff to report it, {{and she went to}} the police, who began an investigation. Grundy's body was exhumed, and when examined was found to contain traces of diamorphine, often used for pain control in terminal cancer patients. Shipman claimed that she was <b>an</b> <b>addict</b> and showed them comments in his compuerised medical journal, but a program on his computer showed they were written after her death. Shipman was arrested on 7 September 1998, and was found to own a typewriter of the kind used to make the forged will.|$|E
25|$|In the USA, the Harrison Act {{was passed}} in 1914, and {{required}} sellers of opiates and cocaine to get a license. While originally intended to regulate the trade, it soon became a prohibitive law, eventually becoming legal precedent that any prescription for a narcotic given by a physician or pharmacist – even {{in the course of}} medical treatment for addiction – constituted conspiracy to violate the Harrison Act. In 1919, the Supreme Court ruled in Doremus that the Harrison Act was constitutional and in Webb that physicians could not prescribe narcotics solely for maintenance. In Jin Fuey Moy v. United States, the court upheld that it was a violation of the Harrison Act even if a physician provided prescription of a narcotic for <b>an</b> <b>addict,</b> and thus subject to criminal prosecution. This is also true of the later Marijuana Tax Act in 1937. Soon, however, licensing bodies did not issue licenses, effectively banning the drugs.|$|E

500|$|For {{the rest}} of his {{lifetime}} Delius's more popular pieces were performed in England and abroad, often under the sponsorship of Beecham, who was primarily responsible for the Delius festival in October–November 1929. In a retrospective comment on the festival The Times critic wrote of full houses and an apparent enthusiasm for [...] "music which hitherto has enjoyed no exceptional vogue", but wondered whether this new acceptance was based on a solid foundation. After Delius's death Beecham continued to promote his works; a second festival was held in 1946, and a third (after Beecham's death) at Bradford in 1962, to celebrate the centenary of Delius's birth. These occasions were {{in the face of a}} general indifference to the music; writing in the centenary year, the musicologist Deryck Cooke opined that at that time, [...] "to declare oneself a confirmed Delian is hardly less self-defamatory than to admit to being <b>an</b> <b>addict</b> of cocaine and marihuana".|$|E

That same month, she made another appearance on The Howard Stern Show, where she was slurring her words and going off on random tangents. On the program, she claimed not to want to do drugs anymore, but said that if a line of cocaine was in front of her, she would do it. After her appearance, she entered a facility specializing in helping people with depression, and she decided to stop drinking. In early 2008, Laurer appeared on the VH1 reality TV show Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew, but she claimed on the show that she did not consider herself <b>an</b> <b>addict.</b> On December 27, 2008, she {{was rushed to the hospital}} after her birthday party, where she was found passed out with cuts on her arms.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{story and}} {{characters}} also received praise. Snider {{said that the}} story {{is driven by the}} characters, and that the choices presented in the game were difficult, making him regret some choices for weeks after completing the game. He added that the game's main quest was well written, and its quality boosted by excellent voice acting; he called the performance of Claudia Black as Morrigan {{one of the best in}} the game. VanOrd commended the game's story, saying that it was memorable and crafted with care, successfully making players care about the game's world and characters. He added that the deep character development made every choice [...] "momentous". GamesRadar thought that the story and the Warden's appearance felt generic, but that the story become more and more engrossing as it progressed. Nick Tan from Game Revolution liked the banter between companions as a humorous change of pace within the game. Gerald Villoria from GameSpy praised the exclusion of the moral system for making the characters feel more complex. Juba wrote that the story was good but predictable, not straying far from standard fantasy stories. Wesley Yin-Poole from VideoGamer.com called the story memorable, saying that it [...] "leaves an itch in your mind", and has attracted players to return to the game [...] "like <b>an</b> <b>addict</b> seeking a hit of relief." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{they began}} to play, bassist Adam Clayton {{developed}} a bassline. The part was originally based on the Grandmaster Melle Mel song [...] "White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)" [...] before Clayton changed to a more trance-like bassline. Vocalist Bono created some melodies and sang over the music. During the album's recording, Bono had become tired of writing in the first-person and he began writing lyrics and singing {{from the perspective of}} different characters. During the writing of [...] "Moment of Surrender", Bono assumed the character of a drug addict having a crisis of faith. The song title was borrowed from the Alcoholics Anonymous term for when <b>an</b> <b>addict</b> admits being [...] "powerless over alcohol" [...] and needs help. Bono had attempted to use the phrase [...] "vision over visibility" [...] in the lyrics of earlier songs; however, [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] was the first song where he felt it was appropriate to be used. Eno called Bono's singing in this character as [...] "so heartbreaking agonized and vulnerable", creating a feeling like [...] "a knife to the heart". Lanois contributed by developing the gospel-like chorus. The uneven hi-hat from the drum part stems from Mullen's electronic drum kit malfunctioning during the song's recording. Eno was amazed by each performer's ability to develop and play their part without any instructions or cues. After the song's recording completed, everyone in the studio, including a gathering of production personnel and visitors, was completely silent, and Eno suggested {{it was as if they}} had gone on an [...] "emotional adventure of some kind". He called the song's recording [...] "the most amazing studio experience I've ever had", and he believes the [...] "emotional crescendo" [...] heard in the song properly captures how they felt as they improvised the piece. Bono stated [...] "it was a spell and we were in it".|$|E
