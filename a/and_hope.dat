5|$|Cross perfects the Yellowjacket and hosts an {{unveiling}} {{ceremony at}} Pym Technologies' headquarters. Lang, {{along with his}} crew and a swarm of flying ants, infiltrates the building during the event, sabotages the company's servers, and plants explosives. When he attempts to steal the Yellowjacket, he, along with Pym <b>and</b> <b>Hope,</b> are captured by Cross, who intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and Ant-Man suits to Hydra. Lang breaks free and he <b>and</b> <b>Hope</b> dispatch most of the Hydra agents, though one flees with a vial of Cross' particles and Pym is shot. Lang pursues Cross, while the explosives detonate, imploding the building as Pym and van Dyne escape.|$|E

5|$|For XIII-2, Game Informers Joe Juba was {{disappointed}} that Lightning had been transferred to a supporting role in favor of Serah <b>and</b> <b>Hope,</b> whom he saw as weaker characters than Lightning. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found that the story suffers without {{the driving force of}} Lightning's single-minded determination. VanOrd {{was disappointed}} that Lightning and Caius Ballad have relatively limited screen-time, since they come off as stronger characters than the protagonists.|$|E
5|$|The Council of Trent (1545–1563) {{became the}} driving force behind the Counter-Reformation in {{response}} to the Protestant movement. Doctrinally, it reaffirmed central Catholic teachings such as transubstantiation and the requirement for love <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> as well as faith to attain salvation. In subsequent centuries, Catholicism spread widely across the world despite experiencing a reduction in its hold on European populations due to the growth of religious scepticism during and after the Enlightenment.|$|E

5|$|Above the course, zones {{four and}} five, as {{identified}} by Cockerell, contain figures which represent the Christian Church in Britain, with the spiritual lords such as bishops, abbots, abbesses and saintly founders of monasteries on the south, while kings, queens and princes occupy the north. Many {{of the figures}} survive and many {{have been identified in}} the light of their various attributes. There is a hierarchy of size, with the more significant figures larger and enthroned in their niches rather than standing. Immediately beneath the upper course are a series of small niches containing dynamic sculptures of the dead coming forth from their tombs on the Day of Judgement. Although naked, some of the dead are defined as royalty by their crowns and others as bishops by their mitres. Some emerge from their graves with joy <b>and</b> <b>hope,</b> and others with despair.|$|E
5|$|An eagle’s {{appearance}} in the sky when thunderclouds threatened was greeted with joy <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> by people who trusted {{in their power to}} defeat an ala; after defeating the ala, the eagle led the clouds away from the fields. An explanation for this, recorded in eastern Serbia, is that the eagles which nest in the vicinity of a village want thunderstorms and hail as far as possible from their nestlings, so coincidentally protect the village’s fields as well. The role of eagles, however, was controversial, because in the same region there was a belief that an eagle flying in front of thunderstorm clouds was a manifestation of an ala, leading the clouds toward the crops, rather than driving them away.|$|E
5|$|Ant-Man and the Wasp was {{announced}} in October 2015. Peyton Reed confirmed {{he would return to}} direct in November 2015, as well as the confirmation that Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly would reprise their roles as Scott Lang / Ant-Man <b>and</b> <b>Hope</b> van Dyne / Wasp, respectively. In December 2015, Andrew Barrer, Gabriel Ferrari, and Rudd were confirmed to write the screenplay, with Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers revealed to have also contributed to the script in August 2017. In February 2017, Michael Douglas confirmed he would reprise his role as Hank Pym in the film. Filming began in August 2017 in Atlanta with additional filming in San Francisco, and is scheduled to last until November 2017. Ant-Man and the Wasp is scheduled to be released on July 6, 2018.|$|E

5|$|Bradbury's {{strategy}} {{from the}} semifinal onwards was to cruise behind his opponents <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> that they crashed, as he realised {{that he could}} not match their raw pace. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a racing incident, and if two (or more) riders collided and fell, the remaining three would all receive medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only increase his chance of being caught in a collision and falling.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{satisfactory}} inspection {{carried out by}} Major Marindin of the Board of Trade on 3 September 1892, the line between Paddock Wood <b>and</b> <b>Hope</b> Mill, for Goudhurst and Lamberhurst was opened to passenger and goods traffic nine days later. The first service drawn by Cudworth E1 class 2-4-0 No. 112 left Hope Mill at 08:25 and free travel was offered throughout the day. The official opening took place on 1 October 1892, and services were extended to Hawkhurst on 4 September 1893. The line was worked by the SER (soon to become the SECR) which formally absorbed the Cranbrook and Paddock Wood Railway on 29 January 1900.|$|E
5|$|From 1964–2010, {{and again}} since 2012, the Flag of Malawi {{is made up}} of three equal {{horizontal}} stripes of black, red and green with a red rising sun superimposed {{in the center of the}} black stripe. The black stripe represented the African people, the red represented the blood of martyrs for African freedom, green represented Malawi's ever-green nature and the rising sun represented the dawn of freedom <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> for Africa. In 2010, the flag was changed, removing the red rising sun and adding a full white sun in the center as a symbol of Malawi's economic progress. The change was reverted in 2012.|$|E

5|$|Heathen deities are {{not seen}} as perfect, omnipotent, and omnipresent, and are instead viewed as having their own {{strengths}} and weaknesses. Many practitioners believe that these deities will one day die, as did, for instance, the god Baldr in Norse mythology. Heathens view their connection with their deities not as being that of a master and servant but rather as an interdependent relationship akin {{to that of a}} family. For them, these deities serve as both examples and role models whose behavior is to be imitated. Many practitioners believe that they can communicate with these deities, as well as negotiate, bargain, and argue with them, <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> that through venerating them, practitioners will gain wisdom, understanding, power, or visionary insights.|$|E
5|$|Hope {{is closely}} related to Idle Child of Fancy, {{completed}} by Watts in 1885, which also shows a personification of one of the traditional virtues (in this case Love) sitting on a cloud-shrouded globe. In traditional depictions of the virtues, Love was shown blindfolded while Hope was not; in Hope and Idle Child Watts reversed this imagery, depicting Love looking straight ahead <b>and</b> <b>Hope</b> as blind. It {{is believed to be the}} first time a European artist depicted Hope as blind.|$|E
5|$|In Lightning Returns, {{after being}} {{released}} from his imprisonment, Snow meets up with Noel <b>and</b> <b>Hope</b> before coming upon the city of Yusnaan and becomes its protector and patron. Over the next five hundred years, he becomes jaded and depressed, brooding on Serah's death and being weighed down by guilt at his inability to stop the world decaying. When Lightning meets up with him, his changed appearance and attitude makes her fear that he has gone insane. When they next meet, Snow reveals his intention to absorb a massive cloud of Chaos {{at the center of}} Yusnaan's palace, transform into a Cie'th and have Lightning kill him as a punishment for his failure. He performs this act and Lightning does battle him, but she manages to reverse the transformation and convince him to keep hoping and help guide Serah to the new world.|$|E
