Geoffrey, she remembered, had not been addicted to mincing words, but, at least, he had lived in accordance with a Spartan moral code.

Later that week, youngster Elliott Whitehouse was allowed to join York City on a month's loan to gain first team experience, before United's poor form continued as they slipped to a 1-0 defeat away at Carlisle United.
