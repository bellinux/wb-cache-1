5|$|As {{the highest}} award for valour of the United Kingdom, the Victoria Cross is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> award to be {{presented}} at an investiture, even before knighthoods, as was shown at the investiture of Private Johnson Beharry, who received his medal before General Sir Mike Jackson received his knighthood. Owing to its status, the VC is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> decoration worn {{in a row of}} medals and it is the first set of post-nominal letters used to indicate any decoration or order. Similar acts of extreme valour that do not take place {{in the face of the}} enemy are honoured with the George Cross, which has equal precedence but is awarded second because the GC is newer.|$|E
5|$|Octopus, Thong's {{partner in}} crime, {{is played by}} Louis Koo, an award winning actor with past {{appearances}} including the TVB drama series Detective Investigation Files IV and the films Election and Election 2. Although Koo co-starred with Jackie Chan, a number of action scenes involving his character were shot with a stunt double. In addition, Koo was the baby's favourite on set—Whenever the baby cried, Koo was <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to cheer him up.|$|E

He grows up to become a judge.|$|E
25|$|The ides {{occur on}} the thirteenth day in eight of the months, but in March, May, July, and October, they {{occur on the}} fifteenth. The nones always occur 8 days (one Roman week) before the ides, i.e., on the fifth or the seventh. The calends are <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> day of the month, and before Julius Caesar's reform fell sixteen days (two Roman weeks) after the ides (except the ides of February and the {{intercalary}} month).|$|E
25|$|In {{the rear}} of the compound, outside the omah, are a number of {{outbuildings}} such as kitchen and bathroom. A well is typically placed on the eastern side. The well, as the provider of water, is identified as the source of life and is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> thing to be completed when building a new house compound. As the size and wealth of a family grows, additional structures (gandok) may be added.|$|E

25|$|When {{they get}} back to the classroom, they wordlessly return to their cages, and their hats and capes come off. The Flyboat also disassembles by itself. Ming-Ming is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> one to get back in her cage, Tuck is always the second, and Linny is always the last. A music style having to do with that day's rescue is played, as Linny takes a bite out of the celery in her cage and winks towards the camera as the closing credits begin.|$|E
25|$|When Michizane died, {{his body}} was carried by an ox that stopped near a Buddhist monastery. Unable to move the body along, Michizane was buried there by his follower, Umasake no Yasuyuki, and the shrine was built there. Today, a statue of an ox stands nearby to commemorate the event. It's {{also said that the}} plum tree inside the shrine flew from Kyoto to be reunited with Michizane in his death, and that it is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> plum tree to bloom in Japan.|$|E
25|$|Although his authoritarian {{father had}} {{forbidden}} {{him to write}} any further stories, Mishima continued to write every night in secret, supported and protected by his mother, who was <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to read a new story. Attending lectures {{during the day and}} writing at night, Mishima graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1947. He obtained a position as an official in the government's Finance Ministry and was set up for a promising career. However, Mishima had exhausted himself so much that his father agreed to his resigning from the position {{during the first year of}} employment in order to devote himself to writing.|$|E

25|$|Originally, {{the game}} {{took place in}} early to mid-January. For Super Bowl I {{there was only one}} round of playoffs: the pre-merger NFL and AFL Championship Games. The {{addition}} of two playoff rounds (first in 1967 and then in 1978), an increase in regular season games from 14 to 16 (1978), and the establishment of one bye-week per team (1990) have caused the Super Bowl to be played later. Partially offsetting these season-lengthening effects, simultaneous with the addition of two regular season games in 1978, the season was started earlier. Prior to 1978 the season started as late as September 21. Now, since Labor Day is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Monday of September, September 13 is the latest possible date for the first full Sunday set of games (Since 2002, the regular season has started with the Kickoff Game on the Thursday after Labor Day).|$|E
25|$|Minorities in {{the city}} {{included}} Sephardic Jews and Muslims (not only the Moors but also Arabs and Islamised Arabic-speaking Latinos). There was a large Jewish quarter occupying the parishes of St. Mary Magdalene, St. Julian and St. Nicholas along the Rua Nova dos Mercadores, where the Great Synagogue was located. The Jews (perhaps 10% of the population, or even more) were great traders, who took full advantage of connections to their coreligionists throughout Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Those who did not engage in trade were largely scholars or professionals such as doctors, lawyers, cartographers and other specialists in the sciences or arts. The Jewish community's business activities were fundamental to {{the vitality of the}} city's economy. The Jews of Lisbon included such distinguished families as the Abravanels, descendants of Samuel Abravanel, a converso who had served as royal treasurer in Andalusia and comptroller in Castile. He apparently fled to Portugal with his family where they reverted to Judaism and later served in high governmental positions. No matter how eminent a social position individual Jews of Lisbon might attain, however, they were <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> victims of popular revolts. Their living quarters were segregated from those {{of the rest of the}} population and they were forbidden to go out at night; as well as being forced to wear distinctive clothes and to pay extra taxes.|$|E
25|$|Ethel lives above Doctor Legg's (Leonard Fenton) {{surgery and}} works as the cleaner in the pub. She is {{somewhat}} of a troublemaker and often spreads the most insane rumours about and gets her words mixed up with hilarious consequences. She is famous for her questionable ability to read-palms and tea-leaves, once even earning a living from it. After Lou's death in 1988 Ethel and Dot become an inseparable double-act and although the two argue constantly, they actually depend on each other a great deal. Despite the fact that Ethel appears totally barmy, she can be quite astute when she wants and she is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{to point out the}} malicious ways of Dot's villainous son, Nick Cotton (John Altman). Ethel is never afraid to stand up to Nick, even kneeing him in the groin once when he attempts to mug her. She also correctly figures out that Nick is trying to poison Dot to get her money, and she refuses to back down, despite Dot falling out with her because of her accusations. Following several falls and a broken hip, Ethel is persuaded to move out of her residence above the surgery and into sheltered housing in 1988. Although she is strongly opposed to this initially, she eventually comes to enjoy her new home, though she would continue to show up in Albert Square regularly.|$|E

25|$|French {{people have}} one, {{two or more}} given names (first names). One of them (nowadays almost <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>first,</b> in the past often the last) is used in daily life (but someone can also choose a usage name that was not given); the others are solely for {{official}} documents, such as passport, birth, death and marriage certificates. Thus, one always speaks of Jacques Chirac and never of Jacques René Chirac; and Henri Philippe Pétain is always referred to as Philippe Pétain (or Marshal Pétain), because Philippe was the given name that he used in daily life. Middle names in the Anglo-Saxon sense do not exist, and middle initials are never used for second or further given names. For example, although English-speaking scientific publications may cite Claude Allègre as Claude J. Allègre, this is never done in France. Typically, second and further given names may be somewhat old-fashioned, given in honour of the child's grandparents etc., though such practice has now become less common. As with English, however, a person may choose to use any one (or several) of their names, relegating the unused names to the birth certificate. Although using more than one name is nowadays out of fashion, using two or even three of the given names as a compound name was fairly common until the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of Roman emperors was especially {{at risk from}} being usurped by their legion commanders (see the imperial crisis of the 3rd century). Several of these agitators came from Britannia. In order to muster enough soldiers for their march on Rome, they reduced their British garrisons in every case far below the level needed for them to mount a credible defence. The forts in the west were <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{to have to give}} up their garrisons because this region was regarded as unimportant due to its remoteness and minor economic significance. Even the advance on Scotland under Antoninus Pius resulted in a substantial reduction of troops in Wales. Only a few forts like Segontium on the northwest coast remained occupied to keep the Celtic tribes living there under control. In the early third century, the Legio II Augusta returned to Caerleon after a prolonged campaign; despite that, the number of Roman troops in Wales remained very low. In the late third century, the local coastline was increasingly threatened by Irish and Scots bandits whose pirate ships operated mostly in the Bristol Channel, the seaway between the southwest peninsula of England and southern Wales. From there, they advanced into the richest regions of Britain, the Cotswolds and Wiltshire. For their defence, a new camp was built in Cardiff and other existing forts were repaired. Nevertheless, the border here became more and more porous since the decimated defending troops could no longer drive off the Irish settlers in the coastal regions.|$|E

500|$|Although {{scandium}} and yttrium are <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{two elements}} in group 3, {{the identity of}} the next two elements is not completely settled. They are commonly lanthanum and actinium, and less often lutetium and lawrencium. The two variants originate from historical difficulties in placing the lanthanides in the periodic table, and arguments as to where the f block elements start and end. It has been claimed that such arguments are proof that, [...] "it is a mistake to break the [...] system into sharply delimited blocks". A third variant shows the two positions below yttrium as being occupied by the lanthanides and the actinides.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Dinklage {{described}} himself as a lapsed Catholic. Dinklage has been a vegetarian since the age of 16. An advocate for animal rights, he supports Farm Sanctuary and has served as the spokesperson for the organization's Walk for Farm Animals. He also narrated the video Face your Food, a film on behalf of PETA advocating a vegan diet on ethical grounds. In 2017, Dinklage attended the Women's March demonstration in Park City, Utah, to advocate legislation and policies regarding human rights and other issues. When asked about the news that president Donald Trump is reportedly ending the funding for national arts and humanities programs, Dinklage responded: [...] "It's <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to go, isn't it?
