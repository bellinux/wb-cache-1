It claims that the green represented the hope of the Portuguese people, while the red represented the blood of those who died serving the nation. Sources believe these noble meanings are far from the truth and <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than propaganda, to provide an honourable justification to their choice.|$|E

Unenlightened beings cling to the body, {{under the assumption that}} it represents a Self, whereas in reality the body is an impermanent phenomenon formed from the mahābhūta. Often characterized by earth, water, fire and air, in the early Buddhist texts these are defined to be abstractions representing the sensorial qualities solidity, fluidity, temperature, and mobility, respectively.|$|E

25|$|The United States Numbered Highways are a {{nationwide}} grid of highways, {{but unlike the}} Interstate Highway System, there is no minimum design standard for these highways. This is clearly evident as some stretches of the U.S. Highways in Texas <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than a two-lane rural road, while others are urban freeways. Although the U.S. Highways have been replaced {{for the most part}} by Interstate Highways for through traffic, the U.S. Highways still serve as important regional connectors. Several notable examples of U.S. Highways that are built to freeway standards include US 75 and US 80 in Dallas, US 59 and US 290 in Houston, and US 90 and US 281 in San Antonio.|$|E
25|$|Tractado del dormir et despertar et del soñar et de las adevinanças et agüeros et profeçía ("Treatise on {{sleeping}} and waking; of dreaming and of divinations; of presages and prophecies"): Consists of six treatises created {{at the behest}} of John II, following his satisfaction with the Tratado de caso e fortuna, and displays a similar orthodox form. It attempts to distinguish divinely inspired dreams concerning biblical scripture and biblical figures such as Joseph, from dreams that <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than dreams. It also explores the Christian theory of the prophet and the omens and riddles presented in the Bible. The British Museum of London has a number of well-preserved copies. There is one hand-written copy dating from 1559 held by the National Library of Madrid and a few more in the University of Salamanca library dating from the 15th century.|$|E
25|$|A “utopia {{resting on}} {{ruthless}} suppression of individual freedom” was Amanda Craig of The Times’s description of Tally’s city. Many critics identified {{the trend of}} a controlling government in the novel. People in the protagonist’s world are “programmed and designed by the Pretty committee, ” with no say-so in their operation, and identity is placed firmly “in {{the hands of the}} state”. Dragoo and Scott point out how segregated the city is, with Pretties, Uglies, Middlies, and Crumblies neatly divided into different sections. Many reviewers have commented on {{the way in which the}} city manipulates its inhabitants, including the supposedly rebellious uglies, who <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than “docile bodies”. Bedies, the dystopian society depicted by Westerfeld includes a particularly common trope in the genre: the duality of spaces, the metropolis representing the totalitarian civilization and nature as a field for freedom.|$|E

25|$|Hermer and Spelke (1994) {{determined}} that when toddlers begin to walk, around eighteen months, they navigate by {{their sense of}} the world's layout. Indeed, {{it would seem that}} a sojourning toddler's world is a place of axial lines and contrasting boundaries. McNamara, Hardy and Hirtle identified region membership as a major building block of anyone's cognitive map (1989). Specifically, region membership is defined by any kind of boundary, whether physical, perceptual or subjective (McNamara et al., 1989). Boundaries are among the most basic and endemic qualities in the world around us. These boundaries <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than axial lines which are a feature that people are biased towards when relating to space; for example one axial line determinant is gravity (McNamara & Shelton, 2001; Kim & Penn, 2004). Axial lines aid everyone in apportioning our perceptions into regions. This parceled world idea is further supported items by the finding that items that get recalled together are more likely than not to also be clustered within the same region of one's larger cognitive map. Clustering shows that people tend to chunk information together according to smaller layouts within a larger cognitive map.|$|E

His {{regiment}} encounters {{a small group of}} Confederates, and in the ensuing fight Henry proves to be a capable soldier, comforted by the belief that his previous cowardice had not been noticed, as he [...] "had performed his mistakes in the dark, so he was still a man". Afterward, while looking for a stream from which to obtain water with a friend, he discovers from the commanding officer that his regiment has a lackluster reputation. The officer speaks casually about sacrificing the 304th because they <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than [...] "mule drivers" [...] and [...] "mud diggers."

Quentin and Nancy believe that Krueger wants revenge on them for lying as children. As {{a result of their}} insomnia, they begin sporadically dreaming while they are still awake. To try to stop Krueger, they decide to go to the preschool and learn what they can. On the way, Nancy falls asleep and is attacked by Krueger, but when Quentin wakes her up, they discover she has pulled a piece of Krueger's sweater out of the dreamworld and into reality. Quentin takes Nancy to the hospital; there, he steals some adrenaline to help them stay awake. At the preschool, Quentin uncovers Krueger's hidden room and evidence that proves Krueger was in fact abusing all of the children; [...] Krueger actually wants revenge on them for telling the truth.|$|E

500|$|Michael Gragg of MusicOMH {{wrote that}} [...] "Though the lyrics are daft [...] it's {{exuberance}} and {{general sense of}} fun is so infectious that when the chorus kicks in you barely notice what she's saying." [...] Jer Fairall of PopMatters wrote, [...] "Look {{no further than the}} wry chorus hook of “Fembot” for proof of Robyn’s deftly subversive sense of humor." [...] Fairall also pointed out that [...] " [...] might hint, at first, in the direction of some Blade Runner-esque sci-fi pathos, but Robyn turns it towards a canny meta-commentary on the fluid sense of authenticity that pervades 21st century pop stardom." [...] Fairall, however, thought that [...] "the verses <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than an inventory of the titular ‘bot’s synthetic virtues." [...] Ben Norman of About.com selected the song as his favorite track on Body Talk Pt. 1, and wrote that [...] "'Fembot' is the incredibly quirky and well-written Robyn-rap track that needs to be heard to be believed." [...] Christopher Muther of The Boston Globe praised the song for having [...] "one of the most entertaining lyrics to emerge this year".|$|E

A month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled Lateralus and that the previous announcement had been a ruse. The album was released in May 2001 to positive reviews. Known for his [...] "dark, intelligent, compelling, and unexpected lyrical twists", Keenan was acclaimed for his songwriting on the album, in which he [...] "doesn't cross the line from darkness to ugliness ... as often as he has in the past". In an interview with [...] NY Rock, Keenan explained, [...] "Everything we release with Tool is inspired by our music. It doesn't matter if it is a video or if its lyrics. The lyrics for [...] "Schism" [...] <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than my interpretation of the music." [...] The album became a worldwide success, reaching No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart in its debut week, and Tool received their second Grammy Award for the best metal performance of 2001 for [...] "Schism". In 2002, Keenan recorded a song called [...] "Fallen" [...] with Thirty Seconds to Mars that was released on the band's self-titled debut album.|$|E
