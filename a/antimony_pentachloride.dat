40|$|The pyrrolo[3, 2, 1 -ij]quinolin- 6 -one {{ring system}} was {{synthesised}} from 3 -aryl- 4, 6 -dimethoxyindoles and 2, 3 -disubstituted- 4, 6 -dimethoxyindoles. The reaction of 4, 6 -dimethoxyindoles under Friedel-Crafts or Vilsmeier-Haack acylation gave the 2 - and 7 -indolyldeoxybenzoins in good yield. Cyclisation of 7 -indolyldeoxybenzoins with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal as a one carbon reagent gave the pyrroloquinolin- 6 -ones in high yield. Reduction of pyrroloquinolin- 6 -ones with hydrogen gas and 10 % palladium on carbon or lithium aluminium hydride yielded the dihydropyrroloquinolin- 6 -ones. Demethylation of pyrroloquinolin- 6 -ones with 48 % hydrobromic acid in {{glacial acetic acid}} gave a mixture of the monohydroxy and dihydroxy analogues in high yield. The synthesis of quinolin- 4 -ones using the Conrad-Limpach method was attempted using three different cyclisation conditions such as Dowtherm A, polyphosphoric acid and a mixture of diphenyl ether and methanesulfonic acid. Quinolin- 2 -ones such as 4 -methyl- 3 -aryl-, 3, 4 -diaryl- and 3 -aryl- 4 -benzyl- 5, 7 -dimethoxyquinolin- 2 -ones could be synthesised from either the N-phenylacetylaniline or the N-trifluoroacetyl aniline strategy. Attempted reduction of the quinolin- 2 -ones with standard metal hydride reagents was unsuccessful. However reduction was achieved via the conversion of quinolin- 2 -one to the corresponding 2 -chloroquinoline followed by reaction of the chloroquinoline with zinc powder and glacial acetic acid to produce a novel, highly substituted quinoline system. Demethylation was successfully carried out with 48 % hydrobromic acid in glacial acetic acid to give the trihydroxyquinolin- 2 -one in high yield. The reactions of 4 -substituted- 5, 7 -dimethoxyquinolin- 2 -ones and the corresponding 2 -chloroquinolines as potential organic intermediates were explored. Facile formylation of both quinolin- 2 -ones and 2 -chloroquinolines was observed under Vilsmeier-Haack conditions while acetylation was successful under Friedel-Crafts conditions using <b>antimony</b> (V) <b>pentachloride</b> as the Lewis acid. Further reaction of 8 -formyl-quinolin- 2 -one with 1, 2 -diaminobenzene in N,N-dimethylformamide {{led to the formation}} of a new 8 -(benzimidazolyl) -quinolin- 2 -one ring system. The quinolin- 2 -ones exhibited selective electrophilic substitution at the C 8 position for a range of reactions. However, an unexpected nitration occurred at the C 3 position for the 4 -methoxy and 4 -phenyl- 5, 7 -dimethoxyquinolin- 2 -ones with good yields. A series of novel 4, 6 -hydroxylindoles was successfully synthesised from the corresponding methoxy analogues in high yield using anhydrous aluminium chloride. When 3 -(4 -bromophenyl) - 4, 6 -dimethoxyindole was reacted with 48 % hydrobromic acid in glacial acetic acid a 2, 2 ?-indolylindoline dimer was formed. The 5, 7 -dihydroxyquinolin- 2 -ones were similarly synthesised in high yield using anhydrous aluminium chloride in chlorobenzene...|$|R

Reactions involving sulphurdichloride, bromine and aluminium trichloride orantimony pentachloride yielded solids whose Raman Spectraare assigned to mixtures of mixed chlorobromosulphoniumtetrachloroaluminates or hexachloroantimonates. No pure compounds involving the ions SCl 2 Br+ or SClBr 2 + were isolated.

However, there are differences from the selenium and tellurium analogues. Reaction of dimethyl sulphide with chlorine or bromine in the presence of a Lewis acid (aluminium trihalide, tin tetrahalide or <b>antimony</b> <b>pentachloride)</b> yielded a series of complexes of the dimethylhalo-sulphonium cation, (CH 3) 2 SX+ (X=Cl, Br). Analogous complexes of the methyldihalosulphonium cation,CH 3 SX 2 + (X = Cl, Br), were prepared from dimethyl disulphide.

40|$|Polyaniline (PANI) is {{synthesized}} via oxidative {{chemical vapor deposition}} (oCVD) using aniline as monomer and <b>antimony</b> <b>pentachloride</b> as oxidant.

Lower substrate temperatures, such as 25 °C, lead to a film that mostly includes oligomers.

What all of these solvents have in common is that they have limited proton donor or even hydrogen bond donor ability. However, the Br$nsted and Lewis basicities of different members vary widely.

The identification of carotenoids was performed by UV-VIS spectroscopy and confirmed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) {{in the presence of}} <b>antimony</b> <b>pentachloride</b> (SbCl 5). The production profile was analyzed using liquid-chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) techniques. Phenotypic characteristics of the isolate were carried out and the 16 S rRNA gene was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Properties of the films are determined using infrared and visible absorption spectroscopy, ellipsometry, Auger, ESCA and conductance - capacitance spectroscopy.

In general, the films showed slight, or no traces of oxygen. The maximum optical bandgap obtained was 2. 7 e. v. The optical absorption studies indicate a downward trend for the optical bandgap with increasing negative d. c. bias on the substrates. The annealed samples indicate a gradual narrowing of optical bandgap with increasing anneal temperatures, as well as a loss in their diamond-like quality.

It was possible to grow single crystals and to analyze it by x - ray crystallography by low temperatures, even though AsCl 5 decomposes in AsCl 3 and Cl 2 above - 30 °C. AsCl 5 has a trigonal bipyramidal structure with two longer axial bonds and three shorter equatorial bonds. It is interesting to compare the different packing in AsCl 5 and SbCl 5.

The other compound forms H 5 O 2 +- ions which are convected with Cl¯ over hydrogen bonds. BiCl 5 could not be isolated. It remains still a challenge for the future. The known SbCl 4 F is crystallized on an other reaction way than the one known before. This comes as a surprise, since it results from a fluorine-chlorine-exchange with CFCl 3.
