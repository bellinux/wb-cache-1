5|$|In 1926, Lai Ah Koon (黎亚坤) {{emigrated from}} Hainan to Singapore, {{where he worked}} as a coffee-stall assistant. He later went on to start his own {{business}} with two other immigrants. They sold coffee, crackers <b>and</b> <b>toast</b> at Telok Ayer Basin, however, his two partners later dropped out, leaving him to run the stall alone. He married while visiting relatives in Hainan, his wife later settled down with him in Singapore. She worked alongside him and later suggested cutting each slice of bread into half and combining the toast with her homemade kaya, this became their signature kaya toast. Registered in 1944 as Ya Kun Coffeestall (Ya Kun being Ah Koon in Hanyu Pinyin), the stall gradually developed a reputation for delicious kaya toast and friendly service. The couple, their eight children and seven other families lived together in a three-storey shophouse across the road, where the Hong Leong Building now stands. As the children grew up, they began to help stir the kaya, run errands, charcoal-grill the bread and eventually, manage the stall.|$|E

The procession then moved to the Travis mansion, where the celebrants dined and danced in the mansion that evening. Also during the festivities, students of the College of William and Mary gave orations. An old barn on the island was used as a temporary theater, where a company of players from Norfolk performed. Attending were many dignitaries, politicians, and historians. The celebration concluded on May 14 with a dinner <b>and</b> <b>toast</b> at the Raleigh Tavern in Williamsburg.|$|E

500|$|In a 2005 {{opinion poll}} by Gallup, {{participants}} {{were asked if they}} felt the renaming of French fries <b>and</b> <b>toast</b> was [...] "a silly idea or a sincere expression of patriotism"; 66% answered it was silly, 33% answered it was patriotic, and 1% had no opinion. Several restaurants followed the Houses' change, and the name is still used by the chain restaurant Toby Keith's I Love This Bar & Grill. Opposing the name change, The Saturn Cafe in Santa Cruz, California changed their menu to [...] "Impeach George W. Bush fries". Meanwhile Reckitt Benckiser, maker of French's mustard, were sufficiently concerned about the movement to publicly clarify that its brand derived from a family name.|$|E

40|$|Iron {{is one of}} the {{essential}} trace elements for humans. In this study, the iron contents in fresh, dried, <b>and</b> <b>toasted</b> nori (Pyropia yezoensis) were analyzed. The mean iron content of fresh, dried, <b>and</b> <b>toasted</b> nori were 19. 0, 22. 6, and 26. 2  mg/ 100  g (dry weight), respectively. These values were superior to other food of plant origin. Furthermore, most of the iron in nori was maintained during processing, such as washing, drying, <b>and</b> <b>toasting.</b> Then, the form of iron in fresh, dried, <b>and</b> <b>toasted</b> nori was analyzed. As a result, an iron storage protein ferritin contributed to iron storage in raw and dried nori, although the precise rate of its contribution is yet to be determined, while ferritin protein cage was degraded in the toasted nori. It is the first report that verified the ferritin contribution to iron storage in such edible macroalgae with commercial importance...|$|R

500|$|The album {{topped the}} Swedish charts and reached No.3 in Germany, but it {{received}} little {{attention in the}} UK. A planned US release through Edel America Records did not happen as the label was disbanded due to financial difficulties, though it did peak at No.2 on CNN's Worldbeat album chart. The first single, [...] "The Centre of the Heart" [...] topped the charts in Sweden, made the top 10 in Spain, and the top 15 in Finland. The other singles, [...] "Real Sugar," [...] the album's opening track and [...] "Milk <b>and</b> <b>Toast</b> and Honey" [...] were less successful. Roxette again went on tour, this time in Europe only, as concerts planned in South Africa were cancelled after the 11 September 2001 attacks. On reviewing their Löfbergs Lila Arena concert, Bjurman from Aftonbladet wrote, [...] "Roxette succeed in all cases, to never leave the 80s." [...] His review criticised Roxette's playlist, which consisted {{of some of their}} early hits. Johan Lindqvist from Göteborgs-Posten was more positive, scoring their Munich concert four stars out of five.|$|E

2500|$|A milksop is an [...] "effeminate spiritless man," [...] an {{expression}} which is attested {{to in the}} late 14th century. Milk toast is a dish consisting of milk <b>and</b> <b>toast.</b> Its soft blandness served as inspiration {{for the name of}} the timid and ineffectual comic strip character Caspar Milquetoast, drawn by H. T. Webster from 1924 to 1952. Thus, the term [...] "milquetoast" [...] entered the language as the label for a timid, shrinking, apologetic person. Milk toast also appeared in Disney's Follow Me Boys as an undesirable breakfast for the aging main character Lem Siddons.|$|E
2500|$|Fenton {{introduced}} continental {{ideas to}} the team, revamping training methods and taking inspiration from higher ranked teams, and even inspiring some. Fenton had been impressed greatly by the all-conquering Hungarians of the 1950s led by Ferenc Puskás, and the Casseteri program {{and development of the}} academy were at the core. [...] Ernie Gregory said (of the 1950s diet), [...] "We'd usually eaten fish or chicken <b>and</b> <b>toast</b> before then, but Dr. Thomas advised us all to eat steak and rice two hours before kick-off. All the other clubs copied us after that." [...] However, not all the changes were strictly down to Fenton; Musgrove attributed much of the training regime to Allison, {{going so far as to}} state that once the players were at the club (signed by Fenton) they were pretty much Allison's property. [...] As well as being a student of the game himself, Fenton encouraged all players to take coaching badges and many of his former players went on to coaching and managing roles after they retired. [...] The Academy also involved, beyond the routine training and development of the youth and squad, actual tactical discussions between the players.|$|E
