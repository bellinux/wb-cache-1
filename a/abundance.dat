Primordial thorium and uranium are only produced in the r-process (rapid neutron capture), because the s-process (slow neutron capture) is too slow and cannot pass the gap of instability after bismuth. Besides the two extant primordial uranium isotopes, 235U and 238U, the r-process also produced significant quantities of 236U, which has a shorter half-life and has long since decayed completely to 232Th, which was itself enriched by the decay of 244Pu, accounting for the observed higher-than-expected <b>abundance</b> of thorium and lower-than-expected <b>abundance</b> of uranium. While the natural <b>abundance</b> of uranium has been supplemented by the decay of extinct 242Pu (half-life 0.375millionyears) and 247Cm (half-life 16millionyears), producing 238U and 235U respectively, this occurred to an almost negligible extent due to the shorter half-lives of these parents and their lower production than 236U and 244Pu, the parents of thorium: the 247Cm:235U ratio at the formation of the Solar System was (7.0 ± 1.6) × 10−5.|$|E

Elemental <b>abundances</b> in the solar wind (SW) are also different from elemental <b>abundances</b> in the photosphere. It is postulated that elemental <b>abundances</b> in the SW reflect the elemental <b>abundances</b> of their place of origin near the solar surface. The solar surface is covered, predominantly, by quiet and coronal hole regions.

Integrated <b>abundances</b> of C, N, and O are derived from CO, CN, and OH molecular features, while Fe, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, and Ti <b>abundances</b> are derived from atomic features.

5|$|Astronomers {{define the}} {{metallicity}} {{of a star}} as the <b>abundance</b> of chemical elements that have a higher atomic number than helium. This is measured by a spectroscopic analysis of the atmosphere, followed by a comparison with the results expected from computed stellar models. In the case of IK Pegasus A, the estimated metal <b>abundance</b> is  = +0.07 ± 0.20. This notation gives the logarithm of the ratio of metal elements (M) to hydrogen (H), minus the logarithm of the Sun's metal ratio. (Thus if the star matches the metal <b>abundance</b> of the Sun, this value will be zero.) A logarithmic value of 0.07 is equivalent to an actual metallicity ratio of 1.17, so the star is about 17% richer in metallic elements than the Sun.
