40|$|Abstract [...] - The input {{feedforward}} path in a ΔΣ modulator is {{an attractive}} technique for low-distortion swing-reduction design. It helps lower the power dissipation, especially in ΔΣ modulators designed with low oversampling ratios (OSRs) in low-voltage nanometer CMOS technologies. However, a ΔΣ modulator with analog feedforward (AFF) requires an <b>analog</b> <b>adder</b> before the quantizer, which can limit the achievable resolution or degrade the signal swing and increase the power dissipation. In this paper, a single-stage multibit ΔΣ modulator with digital feedforward (DFF) is proposed to realize a high-order finite-impulse-response noise transfer function, thereby achieving high signal-to-quantization-noise ratios at low OSRs. Its key features include reduced swing at the opamp outputs, reduced sensitivity to integrator nonlinearities, and robustness to ΔΣ modulator coefficient variations, {{all of which are}} achieved using only minimal additional digital hardware. Behavioral simulation results confirm that the proposed DFF modulator achieves the swing-reduction and low-distortion performance of an AFF modulator, while eliminating the need for an <b>analog</b> <b>adder.</b> I...|$|E
40|$|Low {{distortion}} {{and reduced}} swing {{can be achieved}} by designing the ' 6 modulator with an input feedforward path. Furthermore, the modulator stability can be enhanced and the requirements on the preceding anti-aliasing filter can be relaxed by designing the ' 6 modulator for a flat unity-gain signal transfer function (STF). Previously-developed ' 6 modulators with analog feedforward (AFF) achieved a unity-gain STF. However, their performance is limited by the need for an <b>analog</b> <b>adder</b> before the quantizer. Previously-developed ' 6 modulators with digital feedforward (DFF) eliminated the need for this <b>analog</b> <b>adder.</b> However, their STF was not unity. In this paper, a technique for designing digitally-enhanced ' 6 modulators with both a DFF path and a unity-gain STF is presented. A 2 nd-order DFF ' 6 modulator with a unity-gain STF is then proposed. Its key features include reduced signal swing at the opamp outputs, reduced sensitivity to integrator nonlinearities, and robustness to ' 6 modulator coefficient variations. Behavioral simulation results confirm its performance advantages versus previously-developed AFF and DFF ' 6 modulators. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Loopback {{testing of}} Mixed-signal SOCs {{provides}} a low-cost test solution, but suffers from fault masking, resulting in serious yield loss and low test accuracy. This paper presents an efficient loopback test methodology which enables individual characterization of dynamic performance of Devices Under Test (DUTs) in loopback mode. DUTs are loop-backed externally on a loadboard (DUT board), {{and a simple}} filter and an <b>analog</b> <b>adder</b> on the loadboard produce a composite loopback response. Characteristic parameters are extracted from these loopback responses, and a non-linear regression technique based on spectral predictors is used to predict various performance parameters such as Gain, SNR, THD and SINAD. The spectral predictor provides more accurate and reliable prediction compared to a time-domain approach. Both simulation and hardware measurements are presented to validate the proposed technique.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the influence of}} signal stationarity on digital stochastic measurement method implementation. The implementation method is based on stochastic voltage generators, <b>analog</b> <b>adders,</b> low resolution A/D converter, and multipliers and accumulators implemented by Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The characteristic of first implementations of digital stochastic measurement was the measurement of stationary signal harmonics over the constant measurement period. Later, digital stochastic measurement was extended and used also when {{it was necessary to}} measure timeseries of non-stationary signal over the variable measurement time. The result of measurement is the set of harmonics, which is, in the case of non-stationary signals, the input for calculating digital values of signal in time domain. A theoretical approach to determine measurement uncertainty is presented and the accuracy trends with varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are analyzed. Noisy brain potentials (spontaneous and nonspontaneous) are selected as an example of real non-stationary signal and its digital stochastic measurement is tested by simulations and experiments. Tests were performed without noise and with adding noise with SNR values of 10 dB, 0 dB and - 10 dB.

Through {{the combination of a}} modified architecture and comparator interpolation this high quantizer resolution is achieved with only 15 comparators. However, it turns out that this approach imposes a severe speed constraint on the <b>analog</b> <b>adder</b> circuit. The modulator consists of a third-order loop and special care was taken {{in the design of the}} loop filter. The presented design has two particular features. First, an explicit and controlled delay of 0. 25 times the sampling period is introduced in the loop. Second, the Nyquist stability criterion and the vector gain margin are adopted to design a robustly stable modulator loop filter. This way our modulator does not require any tuning or trimming of the filter coefficients. Measurement results show a peak SNR of 82 dB and a dynamic range of 85 dB for a bandwidth of 1. 5 MHz...|$|E

The non-ideal analyses for all of the proposed circuits are given. Design examples for realizing 10 mH inductances are presented and tested with SPICE. The simulations are based on level 49 TSMC 0. 25 mu m process parameters. The designed inductances show good performance between a few ten kHz to a few MHz. In addition inverting and non-inverting all-pass filter examples providing 90 degree phase shift at 790 kHz are given.
