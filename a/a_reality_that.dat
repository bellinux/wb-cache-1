5|$|For much of Ernest's reign, {{the heir}} {{presumptive}} to Saxe-Coburg and Gotha {{was his only}} sibling Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria. When it became increasingly more clear that Ernest would be childless, {{the possibility of a}} personal union between his duchies and the United Kingdom became real, <b>a</b> <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> was deemed undesirable. Special arrangements were made by a combination of constitutional clauses and renunciations to pass Ernest's throne to a son of Albert while preventing a personal union. Consequently, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, his brother's second eldest son, was designated the childless Ernest's heir presumptive on 14 December 1861, when his older brother the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII of the United Kingdom) renounced his succession rights.|$|E
25|$|Dharma traditions do {{not hold}} history central to their faith. Gautama Buddha {{emphasized}} that his enlightenment was merely a discovery of <b>a</b> <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> is always there. He was not bringing any new covenants from any God. The history of the Buddha is not necessary for Buddhist principles to work. In fact, Buddha stated that he was neither the first nor {{the last person to}} have achieved the state of enlightenment. He also asserted that he was not God nor sent by any God as a prophet, and whatever he discovered was available to every human to discover for himself. This makes Buddhism not History-Centric.|$|E

The proportion rose to 37% in the Montreal metropolitan area, where bilingualism is common. Outside Montreal, on {{the other}} hand, the proportion of anglophones has shrunk to 3% of the population and, except on the Ontario and U.S. borders, struggles to maintain a critical mass to support educational and health institutions – <b>a</b> <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> only immigrants and francophones usually experience in the other provinces. Unilingual anglophones are however still on the decline because of the higher English-French bilingualism of the community's younger generations.|$|E

25|$|In {{economic}} terms {{the division of}} the Three Kingdoms reflected <b>a</b> <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> long endured. Even during the Northern Song dynasty, 700 years after the Three Kingdoms period, it was possible to think of China as being composed of three great regional markets. (The status of the northwest was slightly ambivalent, as it had links with the northern region and Sichuan). These geographical divisions are underscored {{by the fact that the}} main communication routes between the three main regions were all man-made: the Grand Canal linking north and south, the hauling-way through the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River linking southern China with Sichuan and the gallery roads joining Sichuan with the northwest. The break into three separate entities was quite natural and even anticipated by such political foresight as that of Zhuge Liang (see Longzhong Plan).|$|E
25|$|The {{dawn of the}} First World War in July 1914 {{brought an}} end to the feud between the two rival orchestras: the Helsinki Symphony Orchestra {{collapsed}} after the German musicians who formed its backbone were expelled from the country, and Kajanus and Schnéevoigt divided conducting duties for a joint orchestra, the Helsinki City Orchestra, that consisted of about forty players surviving on starvation wages. As a result of the merger, Madetoja (and, a year later, Kuula) became expendable; with little money, Madetoja pawned his metronome in an attempt to stave off penury. Despite the hostilities, he traveled to Russia in September 1914 to take up the conductorship of the Viipuri Orchestra (1914–1916). Madetoja found the Viipuri Orchestra in a state of relative devastation: he was able to piece together 19 musicians, <b>a</b> <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> forced him to spend much of his time finding and arranging material for such an undersized ensemble.|$|E
25|$|By {{virtue of}} his belief that human history and {{collective}} praxis determine whether any philosophical question is meaningful or not, Gramsci's views run contrary to the metaphysical materialism and 'copy' theory of perception advanced by Engels and Lenin, though he does not explicitly state this. For Gramsci, Marxism does not deal with <b>a</b> <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> exists in and for itself, independent of humanity. The concept of an objective universe outside of human history and human praxis was, in his view, analogous to belief in God. Gramsci defined objectivity {{in terms of a}} universal intersubjectivity to be established in a future communist society. Natural history was thus only meaningful in relation to human history. In his view philosophical materialism resulted from a lack of critical thought, and could not be said to oppose religious dogma and superstition. Despite this, Gramsci resigned himself to the existence of this arguably cruder form of Marxism. Marxism was a philosophy for the proletariat, a subaltern class, and thus could often only be expressed in the form of popular superstition and common sense. Nonetheless, it was necessary to effectively challenge the ideologies of the educated classes, and to do so Marxists must present their philosophy in a more sophisticated guise, and attempt to genuinely understand their opponents’ views.|$|E

25|$|Whilst Australia's {{reasons for}} the {{exchange}} of diplomatic missions were known, it was also understood that the Soviet government believed at first that the exchange would serve no great purpose, due to the minimal ties {{between the two countries}}, commercial or otherwise. Both countries acknowledged that if relations, particularly trade relations, were to become <b>a</b> <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> diplomatic relations would be required as a formality. Evatt began negotiations with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Molotov in London in May 1942, and the 10 October 1942 agreement between the two countries to exchange diplomatic representatives was regarded in Australia as a diplomatic coup; given the Soviet Union's position as a great power in the Pacific region. The first diplomatic representatives were Andrey Vlasov for the Soviet Union, and William Slater for Australia. Between August and November/December 1942, Handley Page Hampdens of the 455th Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force were based near Murmansk in the Soviet North, where they were involved in protecting convoys bringing supplies to the Soviet Union against attacks by Nazi Germany. Slater opened the Australian Legation in Kuybyshev, the temporary seat of the Soviet government, on 2 January 1943, and moved to Moscow on 12 August 1943. Vlasov arrived in Canberra on 5 March 1943 to head the Soviet Legation, and presented his Letters of Credence to Governor-General Lord Gowrie on 10 March 1943 at Government House. The Soviet Legation in Canberra was upgraded to Embassy status on 12 July 1945 and the Australian Legation in Moscow was upgraded on 16 February 1948.|$|E

500|$|To many scholars, [...] is a {{landmark}} Latin American novel because of Asturias's early use of magic realism, a literary technique often employed by acclaimed Latin American {{writers such as}} Gabriel García Márquez. In an interview with Asturias, Gunter Lorenz heralded Asturias as the inventor of magic realism, and even as its most successful practitioner. Asturias himself defines this style not as [...] "a concrete reality but <b>a</b> <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> arises from a definitely magical imagination... in which we see the real disappear and the dream emerge, in which dreams are transformed into a tangible reality". Richard Franklin argues that magic realism is most evident in Asturias's exploration and depiction of the innermost reality of the human mind. This exploration is combined with [...] "the material content of an urban mass caught {{in the grip of}} an iron regime" [...] throughout the novel. Franklin goes on to herald the synthesis of these two elements as [...] "a real contribution to the novelistic genre of America".|$|E

It transports him to prehistoric times where he realizes he {{must be careful not}} to do anything to change history. After swatting a mosquito, he returns to the present to find a dystopia where Ned is a dictator of the world. Homer travels back in time again {{attempting to}} set things right; however, he accidentally kills a walking fish, and after returning to the present, he finds Bart and Lisa are giants, narrowly avoiding being crushed by them. He then sneezes and infects the dinosaurs with a cold virus while defending himself from a Tyrannosaurus Rex, which proceeds to cause their extinction. He is initially pleased with the results in the present; amongst other perks, the family is now extremely wealthy and Patty and Selma have died, but is horrified upon discovering that donuts do not exist in this timeline and flees, only seconds before donuts begin raining from the sky. In another world, Willie attempts to help Homer, but is again struck in the back with an axe, this time by Maggie. After several more trips back and forth in time, Homer eventually arrives in <b>a</b> <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> appears normal; he finds humans eating with lizard-like tongues, but finally decides that it is [...] "close enough".|$|E
500|$|Black {{nationalist}} {{poet and}} author Haki R. Madhubuti (Don L. Lee) agreed with Bennett's {{assessment of the}} film, stating that it was [...] "a limited, money-making, auto-biographical fantasy of the odyssey of one Melvin Van Peebles through what he {{considered to be the}} Black community." [...] The New York Times critic Clayton Riley viewed the film more favorably, commenting on its aesthetic innovation, but stated of the character of Sweetback that he [...] "is the ultimate sexualist in whose seemingly vacant eyes and unrevealing mouth are written the protocols of American domestic colonialism." [...] In another review, Riley explained that [...] "Sweetback, the profane sexual athlete and fugitive, is based on <b>a</b> <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> is Black. We may not want him to exist but he does." [...] Critic Donald Bogle states in a New York Times interview that the film in some ways met the black audience's compensatory needs after years of asexual, Sidney Poitier-type characters and that they wanted a [...] "viable, sexual, assertive, arrogant black male hero." [...] In a compendium about the Museum of Modern Art's film and media collection, curator Steven Higgins describes the film's place in history: [...] "Not since Oscar Micheaux had an African American filmmaker taken such complete control of the creative process, turning out a work so deeply connected to his own personal and cultural reality that he was not surprised when the white critical establishment professed bewilderment... depends less on its story of a superstud running from the police than it does on its disinterest in referencing white culture and its radically new understanding of how style and substance inform each other." ...|$|E
500|$|However, as is {{most often}} the case with film adaptations, {{differences}} do exist between the film and source material. Certain scenes from the book were cut from the film, such as a biology room scene where Bella's class does blood typing. Hardwicke explains, [...] "Well [...] almost 500 pages—you do have to do the sweetened condensed milk version of that.... We already have two scenes in biology: the first time they're in there and then the second time when they connect. For a film, when you condense, you don't want to keep going back to the same setting over and over. So that's not in there." [...] The settings of certain conversations in the book were also changed to make the scenes more [...] "visually dynamic" [...] on-screen, such as Bella's revelation that she knows Edward is a vampire—this happens in a meadow in the film instead of in Edward's car as in the novel. A biology field trip scene is added to the film to condense the moments of Bella's frustration at trying to explain how Edward saved her from being crushed by a van. The villainous vampires are introduced earlier in the film than in the novel. Rosenberg said that [...] "you don't really see James and the other villains until to {{the last quarter of the}} book, which really won't work for a movie. You need that ominous tension right off the bat. We needed to see them and that impending danger from the start. And so I had to create back story for them, what they were up to, to flesh them out a bit as characters." [...] Rosenberg also combined some of the human high school students, with Lauren Mallory and Jessica Stanley in the novel becoming the character of Jessica in the film, and a [...] "compilation of a couple of different human characters" [...] becoming Eric Yorkie. About these variances from the book, Mooradian stated, [...] "I think we did a really judicious job of distilling [...] Our greatest critic, Stephenie Meyer, loves the screenplay, and that tells me that we made all the right choices in terms of what to keep and what to lose. Invariably, you're going to lose bits and pieces that certain members of the audience are going to desperately want to see, but there's just <b>a</b> <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> we're not making 'Twilight: The Book' the movie." ...|$|E
