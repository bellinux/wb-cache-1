Ahmad Mohamed Mahmoud of Al-Ta'awun became the first journalist to die covering the protests, from gunshot wounds sustained on 28January.|$|E
5|$|Genera with closed fruitbodies {{within the}} family are form taxa instead of natural groups: Arcangeliella, Gastrolactarius, and Zelleromyces are phylogenetically part of Lactarius, while Cystangium, Elasmomyces, Gymnomyces, Macowanites, and Martellia belong to Russula. Nevertheless, some of these genus names are still in use, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{concerned}} species have not yet formally been synonymised with Lactarius or Russula.|$|E

50|$|The castle, {{built by}} Swiss {{engineer}} Wawrzyniec (Lawrence) Senes (probably born in Sent, Switzerland), {{is a typical}} example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> so-called palazzo in fortezza - an intermingling of both palace and fortress. <b>The</b> total size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex is 1.3 hectares; <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> perimeter walls is 700 meters; <b>the</b> total area <b>of</b> all interior rooms is around 70 000 square meters. The basic design was based on <b>the</b> palace <b>of</b> Cardinal Alexander Farnese, located in <b>the</b> Italian village <b>of</b> Caprarola. Reportedly, <b>the</b> castle once had 365 windows (<b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year), 52 rooms (<b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> weeks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year) and 12 ballrooms (<b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> months <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year). For defensive purposes, the castle was erected upon a rocky hill, {{making it impossible for}} an enemy to organize an underground attack.|$|R
5|$|A Han kingdom {{was much}} like a commandery in size and administration, except it was officially, and after 145 BC, nominally, the fief of a {{relative}} to the emperor, including brothers, uncles, nephews, and sons—excluding the heir apparent. The policy of awarding kingdoms only to imperial relatives was gradually adopted by the founder Emperor Gaozu of Han (r. 202–195 BC), <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early kings were non-relatives who were leading officers during the Chu-Han contention (206–202 BC). Kingdoms were usually inherited by the king's eldest son born to his queen.|$|E
5|$|A natural {{experiment}} permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families {{after the end}} of the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development. Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 57 genera of {{flowering}} plants contain at least 500 species, {{according to a}} 2004 analysis by the botanical taxonomist David Frodin. The actual numbers of species are imprecisely known, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genera have not {{been the subject of}} recent monographs. For instance, {{estimates of the number of}} species in the orchid genus Pleurothallis range from 1,120 to 2,500. Genera from other groups of vascular plants, but which have similarly large numbers of species, include Selaginella, Asplenium and Cyathea.|$|E

50|$|The Scheme {{is notable}} for being very pass centric with <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 65-75% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calls during a season being a pass play. A large reason {{is due to}} the control that is placed on the QB who has the freedom to audible to any play based on what the defense is showing him at <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> scrimmage. In at least one instance, as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> QB's ability to audible, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 90% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> run plays called in a season were audibled to at <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> scrimmage.|$|R

5|$|After Climbié's death, {{the parties}} {{involved}} in her case were widely criticised. A public inquiry, headed by Lord Laming, was ordered. It discovered numerous instances where Climbié could have been saved, noted {{that many of the}} organisations involved in her care were badly run, and discussed the racial aspects surrounding the case, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants were black. The subsequent report by Laming made numerous recommendations related to child protection in England. Climbié's death was largely responsible for the formation of the Every Child Matters initiative; the introduction of the Children Act 2004; the creation of the ContactPoint project, a government database designed to hold information on all children in England (now defunct after closure by the government of 2010); and the creation of the Office of the Children's Commissioner chaired by the Children's Commissioner for England.|$|E
5|$|As in Britain, some Southern Rhodesian women {{during the}} war {{presented}} men not wearing military uniform with white feathers (symbolising cowardice). This campaign often went awry, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> men presented with the feathers were not in fact shirking from service. In 1916, hoping to save them further harassment, the Rhodesia Herald and other newspapers began publishing lists of men who had volunteered only to be deemed medically unfit by the army doctors.|$|E
5|$|Baseball was a {{reasonably}} popular sport in Australia {{in the early}} 20th century and Ponsford alternated between cricket and baseball throughout his sporting life. At the time, baseball was generally played in Australia during the winter months, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading players were enthusiastic cricketers who viewed the sport {{as a means of}} improving their fielding skills. As with cricket, Ponsford started his baseball career at Alfred Crescent School, where his coach was the former Victorian player Charles Landsdown. As a junior Ponsford played shortstop, later as a senior for the Fitzroy Baseball Club he converted to catching.|$|E

5|$|Dawson City {{was founded}} in 1896 {{in the early days}} of the Klondike Gold Rush, {{alongside}} the Yukon River in north-western Canada. Swelled by would-be gold-miners and adventurers, Dawson's population soared to 30,000 at the height of the rush in 1898. Dawson declined in size again <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immigrants left, but it was appointed the Territorial Capital of the new Yukon Territory in 1900, and by the following year it had a stable population of around 10,000.|$|E
5|$|During the {{engagement}} the Japanese {{had opened up}} with the artillery that they had brought up {{in support of the}} main defensive position on Tsimba Ridge, firing {{for the first time in}} the sector. This barrage was largely ineffective, inflicting only one casualty, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shells proved to be faulty and did not detonate. The Australians also came across a large camp, including a field hospital, which they captured intact. Another group of huts was also discovered, from where they gained intelligence identifying the Japanese troops in the area as belonging to the 81st Infantry Regiment. They also managed to capture two 70mm guns, and ammunition for them.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{aftermath}} of the Cold War is not always easily erased, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute. The breakdown of state control {{in a number of areas}} formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure.|$|E
5|$|Hume has {{suggested}} that the Mascarene parrots have a common origin in the radiation of the Psittaculini tribe, basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. The Psittaculini may have invaded the area several times, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea.|$|E

5|$|In late 1957, Cameron {{moved to}} San Francisco {{with her friends}} Norman Rose and David Metzer. There she mingled within the same bohemian social circles <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beat {{generation}} of artists and writers, and was a regular at avant-garde poetry readings. She began {{a relationship with the}} artist Burt Shonberg, and with him moved into a ranch outside of Joshua Tree. Together they began exploring the subject of Ufology, and became friends with the ufologist George Van Tassel. After Kimmel was released from a psychiatric ward, Cameron re-established her relationship with him, and in 1959 they were married in a civil ceremony at Santa Monica City Hall; their relationship was strained and they separated soon after.|$|E
5|$|In the Commonwealth context, too, Britain {{knew that}} simply {{granting}} independence to Southern Rhodesia {{was out of}} the question <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Afro-Asian countries were also Commonwealth members. Statehood for Salisbury without majority rule would split the Commonwealth and perhaps cause it to break up, a disastrous prospect for British foreign policy. The Commonwealth repeatedly called on Britain to intervene directly should Southern Rhodesian defiance continue, while liberals in Britain worried that if left unchecked Salisbury might drift towards South African-style apartheid. Anxious to avoid having to choose between Southern Rhodesia and the Commonwealth, Whitehall attempted to negotiate a middle way between the two, but ultimately put international considerations first, regarding them as more important.|$|E
