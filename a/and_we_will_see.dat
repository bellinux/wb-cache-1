25|$|We {{can extend}} {{the notion of}} a {{harmonic}} oscillator to a one lattice of many particles. Consider a one-dimensional quantum mechanical harmonic chain of N identical atoms. This is the simplest quantum mechanical model of a lattice, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> how phonons arise from it. The formalism that we will develop for this model is readily generalizable to two and three dimensions.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Some one is {{cracking}} nuts up there,' {{said one}} of the merry-makers in the farmhouse. 'Come quickly, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> who it is.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is enough," [...] they answered, {{speaking}} all together. [...] "Set out the matter, King of the Zulus, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> {{what we can}} do." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> now <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> what befell Robin Hood in his venture as beggar.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let {{me see the}} 'nothing' before I advise. Bring {{out every}} rag you 've got, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>'ll</b> <b>see</b> what can be done," [...] said Polly, looking as if she enjoyed the prospect, for she {{had a great deal}} of that {{feminine}} faculty which we call [...] "knack," [...] and much practice had increased it.|$|R
5000|$|... where [...] is the kernel matrix with entries , , <b>and</b> [...] <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> {{how this}} {{estimator}} {{can be derived}} both from a regularization and a Bayesian perspective.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{bring me}} one like it, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> which {{can run the}} faster.' And he watched the dog till it had {{disappeared}} round the corner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] said Mistress Madge, {{rising to}} her feet and taking his hand; [...] "lead us to your home, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> if we cannot assist your poor mother." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. B.--Do {{you really}} like it? Call at Greenwood Place, Mrs. Prior, {{the next time you}} pay Richmond a visit, and bring your little girl with you, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{it is of}} no use {{talking about}} that now," [...] Frank said impatiently. [...] "First {{tell me all about}} it, <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> what had best be done." ...|$|R
6000|$|HARNESS. Cut your {{demands to}} the right pattern, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>'ll</b> <b>see</b> you through; refuse, and don't expect me to waste my time coming down here again. I 'm not the sort that speaks at random, as {{you ought to know}} by this time. If you're the sound men I take you for--no matter who advises you against it--[he fixes his eyes on ROBERTS] you 'll make up your minds to come in, and trust to us to get your terms. Which is it to be? Hands together, and victory--or--the {{starvation}} you've got now? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Trust me, madam," [...] {{said the}} Colonel with indignation, [...] "we shall not suffer this barbarian {{to carry out}} his threats, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will,</b> moreover, <b>see</b> instant justice done to your husband." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'It is good,' they said. 'You shall {{go round}} with us, {{and see the}} wounded, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> for {{ourselves}} what you can do. Will you want this chest carried?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let that pass, my boy. Do {{this little}} service for me <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> about the recompense afterward." [...] And {{with a smile}} Lady Trevlyn left him to begin his work.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then {{give me one}} of your longest bones, and I will fasten it to my leg. When I {{give the}} signal, you must pull, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> which can pull the hardest.' ...|$|E
3000|$|This is a {{consequence}} of the fact that, τ ^(j)(a) is a prefix of τ ^(j+ 1)(a), for all j ∈N_ 0, <b>and,</b> as <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> in Proposition  4.2, [...] _j →∞ |τ ^(j)(a) |= ∞.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said I, when I {{had quickly}} {{prepared}} the mixture, [...] "she {{can have a}} teaspoonful of this, and another in ten minutes, <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> whether <b>we</b> <b>will</b> go on with it or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Dr. Lucas, {{whom she}} only then perceived. [...] "He {{must go to}} bed directly, <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> to him. Not another word, Brownlow, till you are there, nor then if you are wise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get {{your things}} together, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> {{what can be}} done. But remember, dear, that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poor people to try to ape the rich." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mary Anna, [...] "it {{looks like}} him. I am afraid {{he has got}} out of some hole, and is going away. Sit still, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> what he will do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will wait}} a minute," [...] said his father, [...] "until {{he gets the}} log cut off, and then he will stop cutting; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> whether we cease to hear the sound." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So there are," [...] Gregory said. [...] "We {{will take}} the bridles out of the horses' mouths, {{so that they can}} chew the leaves up better; <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> if <b>we</b> can find where the wells were." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord Abbot, Lord Abbot, this passes!" [...] exclaimed Bernard the Dane. [...] "Our young Lord is no monk, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> not <b>see</b> each {{spark of}} noble and knightly spirit {{quenched}} {{as soon as}} it shows itself." ...|$|R
6000|$|A dust {{down the}} road caught Curtis's attention. [...] "The mail will soon be in <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> how all this affects the press of the State; the Chicago dailies will not reach us {{for a couple of}} days yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, cheer up," [...] Dominey enjoined. [...] "Take {{a little}} walk with us, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> whether Parkins cannot find us {{a bottle of}} that old Burgundy for lunch. How does that sound?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Never mind,' {{said his}} lordship; 'keep up your spirits, jump into my cab, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> {{how we can}} carry on the war. I am only going to speak one word to [...] "me and my pardner."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "While in camp you {{may play}} such games as you please, during off time, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> if we cannot arrange for {{contests}} at swimming, rowing, and running, {{and to the}} winners suitable prizes shall be given." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{the woman}} smiled <b>and</b> answered, 'Well, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> what <b>we</b> {{can do with}} you,' and, rising, went into the house.|$|R
30|$|In the {{following}} section, we discuss some basic results on semi-invariant submanifolds of a cosymplectic manifold for later use. First, we obtain the integrability conditions of involved distributions {{in the definition}} of a semi-invariant submanifold <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> the geometric properties of their leaves.|$|R
500|$|However, {{after his}} title win, O'Sullivan refused {{definitively}} {{to rule out}} a title defence in 2014, saying in a post-match interview that [...] "I just love playing, so I will definitely be playing in some smaller events, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> just <b>see</b> what goes on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind; the new comers {{will know}} where he has moved to, my dear, so don't be discouraged; and if you don't succeed, come to me, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> what to do next," [...] said my General.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come to me, my boy, {{when you}} have got ten {{thousand}} pounds of your own, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> about it,' he used to say; and Hughie looked very glum in those days, and {{had to go to}} Laura for consolation.|$|E
6000|$|... "In that case," [...] said Nehushta, [...] "draw it, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> {{which is}} the better, man or woman. Merchant, your weapon is your pen. You have not a chance with me, an Arab of Libya, and you know it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{storm is}} pretty nearly over; I {{will get the}} cover off and look round, <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> if <b>we</b> can't boil some water and have some tea. We have never used any of those candles yet; {{this will be a}} good {{opportunity}} to try them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, dears, you can; only be quiet, and let Rose go {{and take}} her iron and be made tidy, <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> what <b>we</b> can find for supper," [...] said the old lady as she trotted away, {{followed}} by a volley of directions for the approaching feast.|$|R
50|$|Shaft is {{the quiet}} {{one in the}} duet. His anger is never {{displayed}} to the viewer, but only its results. Typically, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> him quietly {{standing in front of}} a reluctant witness, <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> him quiet again but with the witness in blood and the room devastated. He uses a Luger gun as a weapon.|$|R
