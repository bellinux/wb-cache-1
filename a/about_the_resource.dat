Each time the associated entity (e.g. a database record) is updated, the holder of the lock increments the lock value block. When another process wishes to read the resource, it obtains the appropriate lock and compares the current lock value with the value it had last time the process locked the resource. If the value is the same, the process knows that the associated entity has not been updated since last time it read it, and therefore it is unnecessary to read it again. Hence, this technique {{can be used to}} implement various types of cache in a database or similar application.|$|E

Water supply, sanitation and hygiene programs have emerged in the light of unacceptable health outcomes from current water management. At the same time large scale development of water resources has continued with projects such as the Three Gorges Dam and threats to groundwater in terms of quantity and quality have occurred through mining and overexploitation, sometimes due to ignorance <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> and lack of governance...|$|E
