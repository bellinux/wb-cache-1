5|$|As {{dictated}} by the prescriptions Ubi periculum and Ne Romani, the conclave should have begun on 4 August, ten days {{after the death of}} Innocent VIII; however, the conclave was delayed to <b>await</b> <b>the</b> slow arrival of the aged Gherardo, bearing a letter from Venice's Council of Ten urging his acceptance into the College.

5|$|Aware of {{the time}} constraints, Otway decided he could wait no longer, and the reduced {{battalion}} headed for the battery and joined up with Major Smith's reconnaissance party just outside the village of Gonneville en Auge. The reconnaissance party had cut a way through the barbed wire, and marked four routes through the minefield. Otway divided his men into four assault groups, and settled down to <b>await</b> <b>the</b> arrival of the three gliders.|$|E
5|$|Candide and Cacambo {{eventually}} reach Suriname, {{where they}} split up: Cacambo travels to Buenos Aires to retrieve Lady Cunégonde, while Candide prepares {{to travel to}} Europe to <b>await</b> <b>the</b> two. Candide's remaining sheep are stolen, and Candide is fined heavily by a Dutch magistrate for petulance over the theft.

5|$|György Borbély, Ban of Karánsebes, {{captured}} Lippa (now Lipova in Romania) {{and other}} Ottoman fortresses along the Maros River {{before the end}} of August.

Michael routed the invaders in the Battle of Călugăreni, but he could not prevent them from seizing Târgoviște and Bucharest. He withdrew to Stoenești to <b>await</b> <b>the</b> arrival of the Transylvanian and Moldavian troops.|$|E

5|$|Just before 05:00, the battalion's survivors, just 75 {{men of the}} 150 who had set out, {{left the}} battery and headed for their {{secondary}} objective, the village of La Plein. The battalion, being too weak, only managed to liberate around half of the village, and had to <b>await</b> <b>the</b> arrival of the 1st Commando Brigade {{later in the day}} to complete its capture.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, George Palaiologos sortied out of Dyrrhachium, {{but failed}} to save the situation. Alexios's ally, Serbian King Constantine Bodin stayed aside with his army, {{intending}} to <b>await</b> <b>the</b> outcome of the battle. When the Byzantines were defeated and started to flee, Bodin retreated with his army. The Turks who had been lent {{to him by the}} Seljuk Sultan Suleyman I followed Constantine's example.|$|E

5|$|After his capture, the U.S. Army handed Hartmann, his pilots, {{and ground}} crew {{over to the}} Soviet Union on 14 May, where he was imprisoned in {{accordance}} with the Yalta Agreements, which stated that airmen and soldiers fighting Soviet forces had to surrender directly to them. Hartmann and his unit were led by the Americans to a large open-air compound to <b>await</b> <b>the</b> transfer. The number of prisoners grew to 50,000. Living conditions deteriorated, and some American guards {{turned a blind eye to}} escapes. In some cases they assisted by providing food and maps.|$|E
5|$|Chas. H. Ross and Mr. Haybeck then {{testified to}} the {{articles}} he recovered from the Spray. The prosecutor, William H. Jelliffe, asked for another adjournment to <b>await</b> <b>the</b> arrival of Willis to testify to the collision. Voorhees opposed the adjournment and moved for Jackalow's immediate release {{on the ground that}} there was no jurisdiction because no crime had been proved to have been committed. Jeliffe replied that he intended to charge murder, piracy, and running away with a vessel with intent to steal it. Vroom granted an adjournment until Tuesday at 11am. Jackalow was remanded to the city prison.|$|E
5|$|Churches {{managed to}} {{convince}} {{the commander of the}} brigade to conduct an operation to free the rest of the work party the following day, by giving him crucial information regarding the work site and the guards. Next morning Churches and Laws returned with some hundred Partisans to <b>await</b> <b>the</b> arrival of the work party by the usual train. As soon as work had begun the Partisans disarmed the eight guards and captured the four civilian overseers. In a short time the POWs, guards, and civilian overseers were being escorted south along a different route than that used by the first seven escapees the previous afternoon.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{to report}} by March 2006, the group {{presented}} its {{report to the}} Government in November 2006. They recommended that a civil partnership scheme would resolve most of the issues for same-sex and cohabiting couples, while providing less benefits than marriage. Offering civil marriage to same-sex couples {{would be open to}} constitutional challenge. They also recommended a legal presumption of partnership for couples which have lived together for three years, or have children together. No recommendations were made for couples in non-conjugal relationships due to lack of research. The cabinet reviewed the report, but no legislation was introduced before the 2007 general election, and in the intervening period the Government rejected opposition legislation, saying that legislation should <b>await</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court appeal in Zappone v. Revenue Commissioners.|$|E

5|$|Mallards usually form pairs (in October and November in the Northern Hemisphere) {{until the}} female lays eggs {{at the start}} of the nesting season, which is around the {{beginning}} of spring. At this time she is left by the male who joins up with other males to <b>await</b> <b>the</b> moulting period, which begins in June (in the Northern Hemisphere). During the brief time before this, however, the males are still sexually potent and some of them either remain on standby to sire replacement clutches (for female mallards that have lost or abandoned their previous clutch, replacement clutch) or forcibly mate with females that appear to be isolated or unattached regardless of their species and whether or not they have a brood of ducklings.|$|E
5|$|Most sources {{suggest that}} the Royal Agricultural Ground was often used as a home venue between 1908 and 1910, before the club hosted matches at the Sydney Sports Ground from 1911 onwards. It was here that the team played all of their home games up until 1986, when the ground was {{demolished}} with the Sydney Cricket Ground No. 2 {{to make way for}} Sydney's main rectangular field, the Sydney Football Stadium. In 1987, games were moved away to the Newtown Jets' home ground, Henson Park, temporarily to <b>await</b> <b>the</b> completion of the Sydney Football Stadium. The team capitalised on this move, finishing second in the regular season. It was the only time between 1983 and 1995 that the side reached the finals.|$|E
5|$|On 6 December 1382, Richard {{ordered the}} crusade to be {{published}} throughout England. Later that month the bishop and his men took the cross at St. Paul's Cathedral. In February 1383 Parliament, after hesitating in entrusting the mission to a churchman, ultimately assigned to him the subsidy which it had granted the king in the previous October for carrying {{on the war in}} Flanders. The king's only stipulation was that the crusaders should <b>await</b> <b>the</b> arrival of William Beauchamp before launching offensive operations against the French and their allies.|$|E
