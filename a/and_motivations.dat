This study was conducted with a quantitative research design using a survey methodology to collect data about the participants’ reading attitudes <b>and</b> <b>motivation.</b> A total of 104 undergraduate students (females: 76 and males: 28) enrolled in the department voluntarily participated in the study. Further quantitative data were also gathered from the participants’ cumulative grade point average (GPA) scores and their gender. The results revealed that prospective ELT students have positive attitudes <b>and</b> <b>motivation</b> in foreign language reading. Also, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between academic achievement (GPA) <b>and</b> attitudes <b>and</b> <b>motivation</b> in foreign language reading.

5|$|In myth, {{the gods}} behave much like humans. They feel emotion; they can eat, drink, fight, weep, sicken, and die. Some have unique {{character}} traits. Set is aggressive and impulsive, and Thoth, patron {{of writing and}} knowledge, is prone to long-winded speeches. Yet overall, the gods are more like archetypes than well drawn characters. Their behavior is inconsistent, and their thoughts <b>and</b> <b>motivations</b> are rarely stated. Most myths about them lack highly developed characters and plots, because the symbolic meaning of the myths {{was more important than}} elaborate storytelling.|$|E
5|$|The basic story {{elements}} unfold as the protagonist, Tim, {{attempts to}} rescue a princess from a monster. Text passages laid throughout the game reveal a multifaceted narrative, giving clues about Tim's contemplations <b>and</b> <b>motivations.</b> The game features traditional aspects of the platform genre while integrating various powers of time-manipulation. Using these abilities, the player progresses by finding and assembling jigsaw puzzle pieces.|$|E
5|$|David was {{conceptualized}} {{as a character}} to provide a non-human perspective for the theme of meeting one's creators in Prometheus, with him representing the next generation {{in a line of}} creators who finds himself disillusioned by his predecessors. Fassbender, who was director Ridley Scott's first choice for the role, helped fashion the character to share traits with T. E. Lawrence, who was a source of inspiration as a control freak caught between two cultures- the cultures being humanity and synthetics, in David's case. As the series progresses, David's behaviors <b>and</b> <b>motivations</b> evolve from a mysterious agent with ambiguous motivations to a character directly opposing the well-being of humanity.|$|E

5|$|While {{the concept}} of only eating locally grown food is not new, the book coincided with the {{emerging}} popularity of the locavore movement and farmer's markets. Media outlets in North America examined the feasibility of only eating food produced locally, local food-themed events, and locavore groups. During World Food Day in 2006, playing off the popularity of Smith and MacKinnon's articles in The Tyee, the Vancouver City Hall held a 100-mile themed breakfast. Locavore groups have held local-only dinner parties and week-long challenges. Some restaurants and caterers offered 100-mile menus, one being The Herbfarm Restaurant in Woodinville, Washington. Some farmers, gardeners, or regional food producers began offering subscription services to deliver produce or urban farming or gardening services. The 100-mile diet spawned many variations to allow for various circumstances <b>and</b> <b>motivations.</b> Examples include the allowance of a few non-local items, like Barbara Kingsolver chose to include spices into her local diet, or expanding the geographic area to more convenient boundaries, like the economic region, or the entire state or province. A 'made-in-Manitoba' diet challenge led to a government Manitoba Food Charter recognizing and encouraging local food markets.|$|E
5|$|The script of Human Revolution {{was written}} by Mary DeMarle, who was {{narrative}} director and main writer. While she did act as chief writer, DeMarle also worked {{on a number of}} other people throughout development so the story could be conveyed through environments and dialogue, along with handling how its progression was influenced by player choices. Sheldon Pacotti, main writer for the first two Deus Ex titles, was brought in as story consultant during the early stages, and was also contacted regularly through production to ensure that the storyline fitted properly within the series chronology. A total of four writers worked on the game, including author James Swallow. DeMarle was brought onto the project four months into its development, after it had been decided that it would be prequel to the first game, focusing on mechanical rather than nanotechnological enhancement technology. As part of her research, DeMarle looked up multiple subjects, from speculated conspiracy theories to the current level of biotechnology: the final story was influenced in large part by her reading of non-fiction and writings concerning transhumanism. DeMarle compared the game's study of transhumanism through main character Adam to that in the 1982 film Blade Runner, while also using the video game medium to put questions surrounding the ethics <b>and</b> <b>motivations</b> surrounding transhumanism in a nuanced way. She also stated that Adam being forced to confront these issues in person was the narrative's central irony, something that had previously been explored using different narrative elements in Deus Ex. The ending, which was ultimately decided using a choice of buttons, was chosen because of technical and time constraints while retaining player interaction. While the gameplay evolved continually through development and some elements required cutting, the story remained almost unchanged, instead being further refined and improved to work out plot holes.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{propose a}} {{theoretical}} model linking emotions, self-regulated learning, <b>and</b> <b>motivation</b> to academic achievement. This model was tested with 5, 805 undergraduate students. They completed the Self-Regulated Learning, Emotions, <b>and</b> <b>Motivation</b> Computerized Battery (LEM–B) composed of 3 self-report questionnaires: the Self-Regulated Learning Questionnaire (LQ), the Emotions Questionnaire (EQ), <b>and</b> the <b>Motivation</b> Questionnaire (MQ). The findings {{were consistent with}} the authors’ hypotheses and appeared to support all aspects of the proposed model. The structural equation model showed that students’ emotions influence their self-regulated learning <b>and</b> their <b>motivation,</b> <b>and</b> these, in turn, affect academic achievement. Thus, self-regulated learning <b>and</b> <b>motivation</b> mediate the effects of emotions on academic achievement. Moreover, positive emotions foster academic achievement only when they are mediated by self-regulated learning <b>and</b> <b>motivation.</b> The results are discussed with regard to the key role of emotions in academic settings and in terms of theoretical implications for researchers...|$|R
