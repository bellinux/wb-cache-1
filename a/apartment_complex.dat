Awakening in his apartment, he hears confirmation on his radio that she is indeed dead in the real world. Similar events repeat with the next three people Henry finds: Jasper Gein; Andrew DeSalvo, a former employee of an orphanage run by Silent Hill's cult; and Richard Braintree, a resident in Henry's <b>apartment</b> <b>complex.</b> All the deaths bear similarities to the deceased serial killer Walter Sullivan's modus operandi.|$|E
