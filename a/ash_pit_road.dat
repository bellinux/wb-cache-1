50|$|Six brick built kilns were {{identified}} {{during the course}} of the excavations. All were fragmentary and truncated by both the modern buildings and later 19th century buildings. All that survived of each was the partial remains of circular structures forming the base of the pottery-firing kiln. A number of rectangular <b>ash</b> <b>pits,</b> evenly spaced along the edges of the main kiln bases, {{were identified}} with each kiln. These contained ash and kiln furniture and were used to collect the burnt material falling from the fires above. Surrounding each of the kilns were cobbled floors, which sloped downward to the external edges of the <b>ash</b> <b>pits</b> - to allow easy emptying of the content of the <b>ash</b> <b>pits.</b>|$|R

50|$|Until 1999, Martinsville was {{notorious for}} having two <b>pit</b> <b>roads.</b> The backstretch <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> was {{generally}} avoided because if a team had to pit there during a caution, any car pitting {{on the front}} stretch {{had the advantage of}} pitting first and not having to adhere to pace car speed upon exiting their <b>pit</b> <b>road.</b> This was rectified when <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> was reconfigured to extend from the entrance of turn 3 to the exit of turn 2. This move allowed for a garage to be built inside the track, and leaves Bristol as the only active NASCAR track with two <b>pit</b> <b>roads.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since {{the length}} of the {{auxiliary}} <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> was significantly shorter than the main <b>pit</b> <b>road,</b> the cars that pitted there were held from 15-20 seconds {{to make up for the}} time that would have been spent if the cars had traveled the entire main <b>pit</b> <b>road.</b>|$|R
25|$|At {{the moment}} of caution, <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> is {{immediately}} closed. NASCAR uses both a {{light at the end}} of <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> and a series of cameras to help determine the moment <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> is closed. The pits are opened once the field is under control of the pace/safety car unless there is an accident near the entrance/exit or on <b>pit</b> <b>road,</b> in which case the pits will remain closed until NASCAR deems the pits are safe to open.|$|R
25|$|After an {{incident}} at the June 2015 Chicagoland Xfinity race where the pit flagman waved a green flag {{but the light}} at the end of <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> was red, NASCAR added a light to the rear of the pace/safety car to help inform drivers and teams when <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> will be open, and thus removed the flagman from the entrance of <b>pit</b> <b>road.</b> NASCAR's official policy is that in the event of a discrepancy, {{the light at the}} end of <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> is official.|$|R
5000|$|When the caution comes out, the {{pit lane}} is {{immediately}} closed, a rule first implemented following the 1989 Atlanta 500. This {{is shown by}} a flashing red light {{at the entrance to}} <b>pit</b> <b>road.</b> Entering <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> when it is closed (with certain exceptions) is a penalty of restarting {{at the rear of the}} field. When <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> is open, a steady green light will appear at the entrance to <b>pit</b> <b>road,</b> and a green light will come on in the rear window of the pace vehicle.|$|R
25|$|If {{the car is}} {{entering}} <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> to avoid an incident and has to cross the plane of road line track side, then enter <b>pit</b> <b>road,</b> no penalty.|$|R

50|$|At Blackwood Manor in Providence County, Rhode Island, renowned {{wildlife}} painter Lord Blackwood summons his housekeeper {{into the}} basement where he reluctantly kills her with a hammer and chisel. He removes her teeth, {{as well as his}} own, and offers them to mysterious creatures down an <b>ash</b> <b>pit</b> within an old fireplace; all of a sudden, the creatures demand the teeth of children. Blackwood begs for them to give back his kidnapped son, only to be dragged down the <b>ash</b> <b>pit</b> by the creatures.|$|R
50|$|This race began {{a series}} of changes to <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> {{procedure}} after the death of a Melling Racing rear tire changer in a <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> accident at Atlanta the previous November.|$|R

2500|$|Since NASCAR {{does not}} allow speedometers or {{electronic}} speed limiting devices, the pace car circles the track at <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> speed during the warm-up laps. This allows each driver to note the RPM at which <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> speed is maintained. Drivers exceeding that speed on <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> will be penalized, typically a [...] "drive-through" [...] or [...] "stop and go" [...] penalty, costing them valuable track position.|$|R
50|$|While {{trying to}} enter <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> with 49 laps to go, Brian Vickers spun {{out and about}} blocked the entrance. He was almost rammed by Marcos Ambrose {{trying to get his}} car facing the right direction. He did get it going the right direction, but had to come back down <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> to serve a drive-through penalty not passing {{to the inside of the}} <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> {{commitment}} line.|$|R
50|$|Debris in turn 2 {{brought out}} the second caution on lap 176. Johnson and Gordon swapped the lead on <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> with Johnson <b>pitting</b> before the start/finish line, but he beat Gordon off <b>pit</b> <b>road.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Pit</b> <b>road</b> safety {{has become}} a major focus of NASCAR {{officials}} in recent years since the 1990 Atlanta Journal 500, where the rear tire changer for Melling Racing was killed in a <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> crash.|$|R
2500|$|In 2014, {{residents}} {{living near}} the Buck Steam Station in Dukeville, North Carolina, {{were told that}} [...] "coal <b>ash</b> <b>pits</b> near their homes could be leaching dangerous materials into groundwater." ...|$|R
50|$|By April 1991, NASCAR {{implemented}} the current policy of <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> speed limits. The speed limit {{depends on the}} size of the track and the size of <b>pit</b> <b>road.</b> NASCAR uses an electronic scoring system, similar to the VASCAR system, to monitor the speeds of cars on <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> by measuring the time it takes to get from checkpoint to checkpoint. The cars are not equipped with speedometers, therefore during the pre-race warm-up laps, the cars are driven around the track at the <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> speed limit behind the pace car. The drivers then select a gear (usually 2nd gear) and observe and record the corresponding RPM on their respective tachometer.|$|R
2500|$|The {{site was}} still in use into the 1960s as this [...] shows. At this stage the {{turntable}} and <b>ash</b> <b>pit</b> were still evident as was the 1939 water softening plant.|$|R
50|$|Debris in turn 2 {{brought out}} the seventh caution of the race on lap 247. Vickers swapped the lead with Jeff Gordon with the former pitting at the {{entrance}} of <b>pit</b> <b>road.</b> He exited <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> as the leader.|$|R
50|$|J. J. Yeley {{brought out}} the fourth caution on lap 171 after {{brushing}} the wall in turn 1. Keselowski traded the lead with Harvick on <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> thanks to <b>pitting</b> before the start/finish line. Harvick retained the lead off <b>pit</b> <b>road.</b>|$|R
50|$|The fifth caution of {{the race}} flew on lap 226 after Reed Sorenson cut down his right-front tire and missed the {{entrance}} to <b>pit</b> <b>road.</b> Gordon swapped the lead on <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> with Joey Logano, but came out the leader.|$|R
50|$|The race also {{introduced}} stricter rules {{in regards to}} vehicle repair after on-track accidents; teams are only allowed to repair their cars on <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> in five-minute windows with six crew members, starting once the car crosses the <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> commitment line, and ending when it reaches minimum speed after exiting <b>pit</b> <b>road.</b> Repairs are restricted to repairing sheet metal, and re-attaching or reinforcing body panels; body panels may not be replaced. If the vehicle cannot be repaired on <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> and {{must be taken to}} the garage, more than six crew members work on the vehicle, or the five-minute clock expires, the vehicle will be removed from the race and can not return.|$|R
50|$|At the lap 20 restart, McMurray led Keselowski, Hamlin, and Logano {{into the}} first turn. On the {{following}} lap, Leicht made a pit stop, as Hamlin took the first position. Hamlin, who had won four previous times at Pocono Raceway, continued to extend his lead to 1.1 seconds by the 25th lap. Six laps later on lap 31, Joe Nemechek pitted, only two laps before Hamlin and Keselowski, and three before McMurray. On the 34th lap, Keselowski received a <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> speeding penalty, as Earnhardt, Jr. became the leader. Four laps later, Casey Mears drove to the garage, while Michael McDowell pitted. At lap 42, Gordon and Ambrose started {{the second set of}} green flag pit stops. On the following lap, Johnson pitted, as Gordon had to return to <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> after receiving a <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> speeding penalty. On the 44th lap, Kyle Busch, Logano and Ambrose pitted, as Johnson received a <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> speeding penalty. Johnson received a second penalty for speeding on <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> on the next lap. Kyle Busch, Harvick, David Reutimann and Newman were also given a <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> speeding penalty. Following pit stops, Hamlin was the leader ahead of Earnhardt, Jr.|$|R
50|$|The fatal {{accident}} on <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> was the trigger {{for a series}} of new <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> procedures in the Winston Cup Series. At this time, <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> had no speed limit, which meant that cars would blast down <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> in order to lose the least amount of time. Drivers were essentially waved into their pit stall by a sign board man who would stand out in pit lane holding up their team's pit board. (Examples of this {{can be seen in the}} movie Days of Thunder.) In addition, <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> was not closed when the caution was first displayed, which would result in cars rushing into the pits before the pace car picked up the field. This was first curtailed by the banning of tire changes under caution, an extremely unpopular move (all other services were still allowed though). The <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> closing procedures (that continue today in a modified form) also began with this pit procedure. New rules for pit crews that required crews to stay on the other side of the pit wall from the cars until their car was one stall away were instituted.|$|R
50|$|The {{biggest change}} that year at Dover {{was a new}} <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> area. Previously, Dover's <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> only had enough room for 42 pit stalls, meaning one team had to share a pit until a car {{dropped out of the}} race. Now, thanks to a new pit wall facing the main stands, {{widening}} the lanes within <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> by 4 ft, the area was rebuilt and all 43 cars will have their own pit stalls that are 4 ft longer than before.|$|R
50|$|With two laps {{remaining}} in segment four, Ryan Newman slammed {{the wall in}} turn 4. Kevin Harvick led {{at the end of}} segment four and Kahne hit the wall. Harvick led the field down <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> since he had the best average finish in the four segments. Kahne had the second best in the four segments and therefore would've entered <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> second but did not because of <b>pitting</b> before <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> was open. Because of this, Jamie McMurray did.|$|R
5000|$|NASCAR {{implemented}} a new camera system to officiate <b>pit</b> <b>road.</b> Forty-five cameras monitor <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> {{and reduce the}} number of necessary officials on <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> from 24 to 10. The system was beta tested during the 10 race Chase for the Sprint Cup last season and [...] "allegedly" [...] detected a high number of infractions such as driving through more than three stalls to get into or exit one's pit stall. Eight officials monitor the system from a truck outside the track and have the final say on imposing a penalty. With only 10 officials monitoring <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> now, NASCAR no longer penalizes teams for missing or loose lug nuts. The responsibility for having those lug nuts on the car falls on the teams.|$|R
25|$|Speeding on <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> during {{pass-through}} penalty.|$|R
2500|$|Passing {{the safety}} car (10-4D) (except for cars being {{subjected}} to the wave-around, or at some tracks where the radius of <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> is shorter than track, as in Martinsville and Bristol, where the <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> speed limit applies, and the safety car may be passed.) ...|$|R
50|$|Debris on the backstretch {{brought out}} the second caution of the race on lap 99. Keselowski and Logano swapped the lead on <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> with the former pitting before the start/finish line, but Jimmie Johnson exited <b>pit</b> <b>road</b> with the lead after taking just right-side tires.|$|R
