25|$|Public {{opinion in}} the United States shows {{majority}} support for the legal recognition of same-sex marriage. This support has remained above 50% consistently in opinion polls since 2010, after having increased steadily {{for more than a}} decade. An August 2010 CNN poll became the first national poll to show majority support for same-sex marriage, with nearly all subsequent polls showing majority support. Opposition to same-sex marriage still retains a majority of support in the following demographic groups: Conservatives, people who agree with the Tea Party movement, people with religious beliefs conflicting with homosexuality, people who attend religious services <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>weekly,</b> Protestants, members of the Republican Party, the Silent Generation, and the states of Mississippi and West Virginia.|$|E

25|$|Due to glycated hemoglobin's {{variability}} (as {{shown in}} the table above), additional measures should be checked in patients at or near recommended goals. People with HbA1c values at 64mmol/mol or less should be provided additional testing {{to determine whether the}} HbA1c values are due to averaging out high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) with low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) or the HbA1c is more reflective of an elevated blood glucose that does not vary much throughout the day. Devices such as continuous blood glucose monitoring allow people with diabetes to determine their blood glucose levels on a continuous basis, testing every few minutes. Continuous use of blood glucose monitors is becoming more common, and the devices are covered by many health insurance plans but not by Medicare in the United States. The supplies tend to be expensive, since the sensors must be changed <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>weekly.</b> Another test that is useful in determining if HbA1c values are due to wide variations of blood glucose throughout the day is 1,5 Anhydroglucitol, also known as GlycoMark. GlycoMark reflects only the times that the person experiences hyperglycemia above 180mg/dL over a two-week period.|$|E

2500|$|A {{meta-analysis}} by Dr. Lee Ann Kaskutas in 2009 {{reported that}} while the evidence base for twelve step groups from experimental studies was weak, [...] "other categories of evidence... are overwhelmingly convincing". Specifically, the correlation between exposure to AA and outcome, the dose-response relationship, and {{the consistency of the}} association were found to be very strong. In other words, the frequency by which individuals attend meetings appears to have a statistically significant correlation with maintaining abstinence. Kaskutas noted two studies which both found that 70% of those who attended twelve-step groups <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>weekly</b> were abstaining from alcohol consumption at follow ups two and sixteen years later. Those who attended less than once per week showed about the same success rate as those who didn’t attend meetings. Kaskutas also found AA to function consistently with known behavioral change theories and substantial empirical support for specific mechanisms through which AA facilitates change.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the next}} ten years, Ruiz claimed that the Virgin {{appeared}} to <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>weekly,</b> and often daily. [...] She identified herself as Our Lady of the Americas and relayed messages to the Ruiz family, {{the people of the}} barrio, and to greater community of [...] "the Americas" [...] via Ruiz, sometimes speaking in English and sometimes in Spanish. The majority of the messages focus on the necessity of prayer, especially of the rosary, and on the need to evangelize and [...] "fight Satan" [...] {{in order to make the}} world a better place. [...] Some have interpreted the demand to improve the world as necessary prepare the world for the second coming of Jesus Christ. [...] She also demanded a shrine, which the family built in their back yard during the next year. The shrine includes of a painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe, a painting of Our Lady of the Americas by Reyes, and a life-sized wooden crucifix, also by Reyes.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{imperative}} (for road riding, at least) that the chain is sufficiently tight {{that it is}} impossible for it to derail from either the chainring or sprocket. [...] This generally equates to [...] "no visible slack". [...] A derailed chain can cause a variety of undesirable consequences, such as a locked rear wheel or, worst of all, destruction of the frame if the chain becomes caught around the crank arm and pulls the rear triangle forwards. [...] On a fixed-gear bicycle without hand brakes, even a relatively benign derailment means a total loss of braking ability. [...] Tensioning aside, a chain is significantly less likely to derail if the chainline is accurate and the chain is a traditional [...] "full bushing" [...] type with limited lateral flexibility. [...] Because the difference between a tight and a slack chain equates to only very minor elongation of the links, chain tension should be visually checked <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>weekly,</b> especially if the bicycle is ridden in wet or dirty conditions.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the night}} of 2 December 1577, a group of Carmelites opposed to reform broke into John's {{dwelling}} in Ávila and took him prisoner. John had received an order from some of his superiors, opposed to reform, ordering him to leave Ávila and return to his original house, but John had refused {{on the basis that}} his reform work had been approved by the Spanish nuncio, a higher authority than these superiors. The Carmelites therefore took John captive. John was taken from Ávila to the Carmelite monastery in Toledo, at that time the Order's most important monastery in Castile, where perhaps 40 friars lived. John was brought before a court of friars, accused of disobeying the ordinances of Piacenza. Despite John's argument that he had not disobeyed the ordinances, he received a punishment of imprisonment. He was jailed in the monastery, [...] where he was kept under a brutal regimen that included public lashing before the community <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>weekly,</b> and severe isolation in a tiny stifling cell measuring ten feet by six feet, barely large enough for his body. Except when rarely permitted an oil lamp, he had to stand on a bench to read his breviary by the light through the hole into the adjoining room. He had no change of clothing and a penitential diet of water, bread and scraps of salt fish. During this imprisonment, he composed a great part of his most famous poem Spiritual Canticle, as well as a few shorter poems. The paper was passed to him by the friar who guarded his cell. He managed to escape nine months later, on 15 August 1578, through a small window in a room adjoining his cell. (He had managed to pry the cell door off its hinges earlier that day.) ...|$|E

The copy belonging to the Ballantyne family had disappeared, not to put too fine a point on it. Eventually a kind family in Canada offered to scan the pages of their copy, and send the images to me, and this is the result.|$|E
60|$|He {{had ceased}} to speak tenderly, though he didn't cease to visit the quiet house in Arundel Street. As far as Margaret was {{concerned}} {{he might as well}} have ceased to come; and in her heart she sang that song of Mariana's, complaining bitterly of her weariness; though the man was seen then in her brother's sickroom regularly once a week. For years this went on. The brother would crawl out to his office in summer, but would never leave his bedroom in the winter months. In those days these things were allowed in public offices; and it was not till very near the end of his life that certain stern official reformers hinted at the necessity of his retiring on a pension. Perhaps it was that hint that killed him. At any rate, he died in harness--if it can in truth be said of him that he ever wore harness. Then, when he was dead, the days were gone in which Margaret Mackenzie cared for Harry Handcock. Harry Handcock was still a bachelor, and when the nature of his late friend's will was ascertained, he said a word or two to show that he thought he was not yet too old for matrimony. But Margaret's weariness could not now be cured in that way. She would have taken him while she had nothing, or would have taken him in those early days had fortune filled her lap with gold. But she had seen Harry Handcock <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>weekly</b> for the last ten years, and having seen him without any speech of love, she was not now prepared for the renewal of such speaking.|$|E
