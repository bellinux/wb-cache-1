40|$|ABSTRACT: Two typical electrorheological materials, {{which are}} {{anhydrous}} dispersions of silica particles in silicone oil with surface active additives, are sheared in oscillatory motion in a gap, formed by an outer fixed cylinder and an inner, <b>axially</b> <b>movable</b> cylinder. The rheometer is operated at tuneable resonance frequencies, such {{that only the}} reaction of the material is measured. Long time oscillatory shear measurements show that the electroviscous stress deteriorates under d. c. elec-tric field, while electroviscous stress is stable when a. c. fields are used. Electroviscous stress is found to depend on field frequency through the dependence of the dielectric constant of the disperse phase on field frequency. A dimensionless quantity, which relates the electroviscous shear stress to the electric field strength, serves to correlate all the experimental data for different shear amplitudes and shear frequencies for each fluid. The phenomenological theory of Huang and Spurk predicts this efficiency with satisfactory accuracy...|$|E

40|$|The {{test probe}} was {{designed}} to measure free-stream Mach number and could be incorporated into a conventional airspeed nose boom installation. Tests were conducted in the Langley 4 -by 4 -foot supersonic pressure tunnel with an approximate angle of attack test range of - 5 deg to 15 deg and an approximate angle of sideslip test range of + or - 4 deg. The probe incorporated a variable exit area which permitted internal flow. The internal flow caused the bow shock to be swallowed. Mach number was determined with a small <b>axially</b> <b>movable</b> internal total pressure tube {{and a series of}} fixed internal static pressure orifices.

40|$|Rotating {{machines}} serves {{an important}} role in many different applications. Extensive research has been made, manly during the last century, in order to develop these systems and understand the dynamics. The theory of rotordynamics differs in many fundamental aspects from structural dynamics and is therefore usually treated as an own research area. In rotordynamical applications there exist several qualitatively different concepts. For example super- and subcritical machines supported on different types of bearings like ball-, roller- or journal bearings etc. At the early stage of the product development, the problem is often to find a general tool which can be used for dynamical evaluation of these concepts. Many concepts also contain significant nonlinearities which need to be studied separately. One such nonlinearity is a clearance which arises between a fixed support and an <b>axially</b> <b>movable</b> bearing assembly. Another nonlinear effect is the loss of contact which can occur in preloaded spherical roller thrust bearings. The aim is hence to present a method to dynamically evaluate different rotordynamical concepts, describe nonlinear effects due to these contact problems and suggest suitable design parameters. For the concept evaluation a linear model which captured the gyroscopic effect is proposed, while the contact problems are handled with nonlinear models (usually piecewise linear). The governing equations of motion are solved analytically in the linear case but needs to be simulated in the nonlinear cases. However, in some special cases it is possible to find steady state solutions even for the contact problems. Simulations of design spaces, Poincaré maps, bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, contact forces etc. have been used to study the systems. In order to evaluate different concept, design spaces spanned by a requirement variable and three design parameters are plotted. These are four dimensional plots where the variations of the requirement variables are visualised by colours. This is done both for the unbalance response and an impact in order to include both the homogenous and particular solution. In the clearance problem bifurcation diagrams and Poincaré maps indicates that multi-, quasi- or chaotic motions are possible which in many cases include impacts. When stabilising rods are applied the unstable areas (positive maximum Lyapunov exponent) are reduced. In the case with the spherical roller thrust bearings nonperiodic motions are found. The stability shows strong dependency on the amount of preload. A method to dynamically evaluate rotordynamical concepts is suggested. Some especially interesting ranges of the design parameters which give low vibrations are presented. It has further been shown that strong nonlinear dynamics which may lead to failure can be expected in systems with clearance between the stator and bearing assembly. One {{way to get rid of}} such unwanted vibrations is to apply stabilising rods. It is than important to choose the right parameters since otherwise worse conditions may occur. In systems supported by preloaded spherical roller thrust bearings it is important that the preloading is high enough. Otherwise jump phenomenon and nonperiodic motions can arise. An expression of the limit preload of going in or out of full contact has been derived which can be used to choose a suitable preloading. Godkänd; 2003; 20070215 (ysko...|$|E
