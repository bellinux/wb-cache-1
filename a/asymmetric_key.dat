25|$|To much surprise, a {{document}} published in 1997 by the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a British intelligence organization, revealed that cryptographers at GCHQ had anticipated several academic developments. Reportedly, around 1970, James H. Ellis had conceived {{the principles of}} <b>asymmetric</b> <b>key</b> cryptography. In 1973, Clifford Cocks invented a solution that essentially resembles the RSA algorithm. And in 1974, Malcolm J. Williamson is claimed to have developed the Diffie–Hellman key exchange.|$|E
25|$|During this turmoil, Zimmermann's team {{worked on}} {{a new version of}} PGP {{encryption}} called PGP 3. This new version was to have considerable security improvements, including a new certificate structure which fixed small security flaws in the PGP 2.x certificates as well as permitting a certificate to include separate keys for signing and encryption. Furthermore, the experience with patent and export problems led them to eschew patents entirely. PGP 3 introduced use of the CAST-128 (a.k.a. CAST5) symmetric key algorithm, and the DSA and ElGamal <b>asymmetric</b> <b>key</b> algorithms, all of which were unencumbered by patents.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{cryptography}} {{is legal}} for domestic use, {{but there has}} been much conflict over legal issues related to cryptography. One particularly important issue has been the export of cryptography and cryptographic software and hardware. Probably because of the importance of cryptanalysis in World War II and an expectation that cryptography would continue to be important for national security, many Western governments have, at some point, strictly regulated export of cryptography. After World War II, it was illegal in the US to sell or distribute encryption technology overseas; in fact, encryption was designated as auxiliary military equipment and put on the United States Munitions List. Until the development of the personal computer, <b>asymmetric</b> <b>key</b> algorithms (i.e., public key techniques), and the Internet, this was not especially problematic. However, as the Internet grew and computers became more widely available, high-quality encryption techniques became well known around the globe.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} modern {{computing}} systems security issues, focusing on biometric based <b>asymmetric</b> <b>keys</b> generation process. Conventional PKI systems {{are based on}} private/public keys generated through RSA or similar algorithms. The present solution embeds biometric information on the private/public keys generation process. In addition the corresponding private key depends on physical or behavioural biometric features {{and it can be}} generated when it is needed. Starting from fingerprint acquisition, the biometric identifier is extracted, cyphered, and stored in tamper-resistant smartcard to overcome the security problems of centralized databases. Biometric information is then used for user authentication and for public/private keys generation. The initial trials have shown that the <b>asymmetric</b> <b>keys</b> generation distinctive power depends on biometric authentication accuracy, assuring unique <b>asymmetric</b> <b>keys</b> for each authenticated user...|$|R
2500|$|Early in the 1970s, {{the concept}} for public key {{encryption}} was developed and proven by James H. Ellis, a GCHQ staff member since 1952, who lacked the necessary number theory expertise necessary to build a workable system. [...] Subsequently, a feasible implementation scheme via an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>key</b> algorithm was invented by another staff member Clifford Cocks, a mathematics graduate. This fact was kept secret until 1997.|$|E
2500|$|Information theory {{leads us}} to believe {{it is much more}} {{difficult}} to keep secrets than it might first appear. [...] A brute force attack can break systems based on <b>asymmetric</b> <b>key</b> algorithms or on most commonly used methods of symmetric key algorithms (sometimes called secret key algorithms), such as block ciphers. [...] The security of all such methods currently comes from the assumption that no known attack can break them in a practical amount of time.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{groundbreaking}} 1976 paper, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman proposed {{the notion of}} public-key (also, more generally, called <b>asymmetric</b> <b>key)</b> cryptography in which two different but mathematically related keys are used—a public key and a private key. A public key system is so constructed that calculation of one key (the 'private key') is computationally infeasible from the other (the 'public key'), {{even though they are}} necessarily related. Instead, both keys are generated secretly, as an interrelated pair. The historian David Kahn described public-key cryptography as [...] "the most revolutionary new concept in the field since polyalphabetic substitution emerged in the Renaissance".|$|E
50|$|Cryptographic {{systems may}} use {{different}} types of keys, with some systems using more than one. These may include symmetric <b>keys</b> or <b>asymmetric</b> <b>keys.</b> In a symmetric key algorithm the keys involved are identical for both encrypting and decrypting a message. Keys must be chosen carefully, and distributed and stored securely. <b>Asymmetric</b> <b>keys,</b> also known as public keys, in contrast are two distinct keys that are mathematically linked. They are typically used together to communicate.|$|R

2500|$|EFS {{works by}} {{encrypting}} a file with a bulk symmetric key, {{also known as}} the File Encryption Key, or FEK. It uses a symmetric encryption algorithm because it takes less time to encrypt and decrypt large amounts of data than if an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>key</b> cipher is used. [...] The symmetric encryption algorithm used will vary depending on the version and configuration of the operating system; see Algorithms used by Windows version below. [...] The FEK (the symmetric key that is used to encrypt the file) is then encrypted with a public key that is associated with the user who encrypted the file, and this encrypted FEK is stored in the $EFS alternate data stream of the encrypted file. To decrypt the file, the EFS component driver uses the private key that matches the EFS digital certificate (used to encrypt the file) to decrypt the symmetric key that is stored in the $EFS stream. The EFS component driver then uses the symmetric key to decrypt the file. Because the encryption & decryption operations are performed at a layer below NTFS, it is transparent to the user and all their applications.|$|E
