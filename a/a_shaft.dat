5|$|In a later {{period the}} Serapeum in Alexandria was also {{said to have}} {{contained}} a solar alignment so that, on a specific sunrise, <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> of light would pass across the lips {{of the statue of}} Serapis thus symbolising the Sun saluting the god.|$|E
5|$|Around 180 BCE the Indo-Greek king Agathocles issued some coinage bearing {{images of}} deities {{that are now}} {{interpreted}} as being related to Vaisnava imagery in India. The deities displayed on the coins appear to be Vishnu's avatars Balarama-Sankarshana with attributes consisting of the Gada mace and the plow, and Vasudeva-Krishna with attributes of the Shankha (conch) and the Sudarshana Chakra wheel. According to Bopearachchi, the headdress {{on top of the}} deity is actually a misrepresentation of <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> with a half-moon parasol on top (chattra).|$|E
5|$|King George V {{had four}} sets of Parsons geared {{turbines}}. Two main turbines were arranged in series and drove <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> through double helical gears. An astern turbine was incorporated in the exhaust casing of the low-pressure turbine, and a cruising turbine was coupled directly to the high-pressure turbine. A speed of 28.5 knots was expected at standard displacement and 27.5 knots at full-load displacement on normal output; corresponding speeds at overload condition were 29.25 and 28.25 knots respectively. The turbine unit was a low-speed type (2,257 rpm) coupled to a single reduction gear which produced 236 rpm at the propeller shaft.|$|E
5000|$|Mechanical transmission, which connects a motor {{inside the}} ship to the {{outboard}} unit by gearing. The motor may be diesel or diesel-electric. Depending on the shaft arrangement, mechanical azimuth thrusters are divided into L-drive and Z-drive. An L-drive thruster has <b>a</b> vertical input <b>shaft</b> and <b>a</b> horizontal output <b>shaft</b> with one right-angle gear. A Z-drive thruster has <b>a</b> horizontal input <b>shaft,</b> <b>a</b> vertical <b>shaft</b> in the rotating column and <b>a</b> horizontal output <b>shaft,</b> with two right-angle gears.|$|R

5|$|Early in December 1900, we {{received}} from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a telegram that <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> of light {{had been seen}} to project from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy minutes. I wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man {{and there is no}} reason to doubt that the light existed. It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. That was all. Now the story has gone the world over. In Europe it is stated that I have been in communication with Mars, and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light was, we have no means of knowing. Whether it had intelligence or not, no one can say. It is absolutely inexplicable.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{entered the}} Americas through Beringia, and {{evidence}} documents {{their interactions with}} Columbian mammoths. Tools made from Columbian mammoth remains have been discovered in several North American sites. At Tocuila, Mexico, mammoth bones were quarried 13,000 years ago to produce lithic flakes and cores. At the Lange-Ferguson Site in South Dakota, the remains of two mammoths were found with two 12,800-year-old cleaver choppers made from a mammoth shoulder blade; the choppers {{had been used to}} butcher the mammoths. At the same site, a flake knife made from a long mammoth bone was also found wedged against mammoth vertebrae. At Murray Springs, archaeologists discovered a 13,100-year-old object made from a mammoth femur; the object is thought to be <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> wrench, a tool for straightening wood and bone to make spear-shafts (the Inuit use similar tools).|$|E
5|$|Lead mining {{peaked in}} the 17th and 18th centuries; high {{concentrations}} of lead {{have been found in}} the area dating back from this period, as well as discovering peat on Kinder Scout suggesting that lead smelting occurred. Lead mining began to decline from the mid-19th century, with the last major mine closing in 1939, though lead remains a by-product of fluorite, baryte and calcite mining. Not all mines were deep underground; Bell pits were a cheap and easy way at getting at an ore that lay close to the surface of flat land. <b>A</b> <b>shaft</b> was sunk into the ore and enlarged at the bottom for extraction. The pit was then enlarged further until it became unsafe or worked out, then another pit would be sunk adjacent to the existing one.|$|E
50|$|Like other {{transmission}}s, {{a manual}} transmission has several shafts with various gears and other components attached to them. Typically, a rear-wheel-drive transmission has three shafts: <b>an</b> input <b>shaft,</b> <b>a</b> countershaft and <b>an</b> output <b>shaft.</b> The countershaft {{is sometimes called}} a layshaft.|$|R
5000|$|In British English, {{the term}} [...] "drive shaft" [...] is {{restricted}} to <b>a</b> transverse <b>shaft</b> that transmits power to the wheels, especially the front wheels. <b>A</b> drive <b>shaft</b> connecting the gearbox to a rear differential is called <b>a</b> propeller <b>shaft,</b> or prop-shaft. <b>A</b> prop-shaft assembly consists of <b>a</b> propeller <b>shaft,</b> <b>a</b> slip joint and one or more universal joints. Where the engine and axles are separated from each other, as on four-wheel drive and rear-wheel drive vehicles, it is the propeller shaft that serves to transmit the drive force generated by the engine to the axles.|$|R

5|$|Maiden Castle {{expanded}} westwards, and {{the ditch}} {{was extended to}} enclose the neighbouring Hog Hill. The peaks of the two hills encompassed by the new, larger hill fort were separated by a dry valley. <b>A</b> <b>shaft</b> dug into the valley was possibly used as a water source. Almost immediately after the single ditch enclosure was expanded to , work began on making the defences more elaborate. The existing rampart was heightened to , and more ramparts and ditches were added. On {{the south of the}} fort, four ramparts and three ditches were added, but because of the steepness of the northern slope of the hill the fourth rampart did not extend all the way round, and only three ramparts were built on the northern side. At the same time, the eastern entrance was again made more complex through the addition of further earthworks, lengthening the approach to the site.|$|E
5|$|The Romans {{produced}} considerable {{quantities of}} brass (an alloy of zinc and copper) {{as early as}} 200 BC by a cementation process where copper was reacted with zinc oxide. The zinc oxide {{is thought to have}} been produced by heating zinc ore in <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> furnace. This liberated metallic zinc as a vapor, which then ascended the flue and condensed as the oxide. This process was described by Dioscorides in the 1st century AD. Zinc oxide has also been recovered from zinc mines at Zawar in India, dating from {{the second half of the}} first millennium BC. This was presumably also made in the same way and used to produce brass.|$|E
5|$|The {{escape route}} led {{up through a}} fan vent; the prisoners removed the fan and motor, {{replacing}} them with a steel grill and leaving <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> large enough for a prisoner to enter. Stealing a carborundum abrasive cord from the prison workshop, the prisoners then removed the rivets from the grill. In their beds, they placed papier-mâché dummies made with human hair stolen from the barbershop. The escapees also constructed an inflatable raft over many weeks from over 50 stolen raincoats, which they prepared {{on the top of}} the cellblock, concealed from the guards by sheets which had been put up over the sides. They escaped through a vent in the roof and departed Alcatraz.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and spent fuel {{is now under}} way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore tunnel boring machines (similar to those used to drill the Chunnel from England to France) to drill <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> 500–1,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. However, many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.|$|E
5|$|With the {{inclined}} plane, {{the problems}} {{stemmed from a}} mis-calculation. Power was provided by a large tank, filled with water, which descended in <b>a</b> <b>shaft,</b> raising one boat on a trolley and allowing another to descend as it did so. When the tank reached {{the bottom of the}} shaft, the water discharged, and the second tank was used to reverse the process. Green had been the engineer on the Bude Canal, where this design had been used successfully, but the size of the tanks at Wellisford were much too small. On the Bude Canal, a tank holding 15tons of water was required to raise a boat weighing six tons. The Grand Western Canal used boats holding eight tons, but the tanks only held ten tons of water, whereas tests indicated that about 25tons was needed. It was for this reason that the steam engine was obtained to supply the power.|$|E
5|$|Pillars are a {{major part}} of Western Chalukya {{architecture}} and were produced in two main types: pillars with alternate square blocks and a sculptured cylindrical section with a plain square-block base, and bell-shaped lathe-turned pillars. The former type is more vigorous and stronger than the bell-shaped type, which is made of soapstone and has a quality of its own. Inventive workmanship was used on soapstone shafts, roughly carved into the required shapes using a lathe. Instead of laboriously rotating <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> to obtain the final finish, workers added the final touches to an upright shaft by using sharp tools. Some pillars were left unpolished, as evidenced by the presence of fine grooves made by the pointed end of the tool. In other cases, polishing resulted in pillars with fine reflective properties such as the pillars in the temples at Bankapura, Itagi and Hangal. This pillar art reached its zenith in the temples at Gadag, specifically the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag city.|$|E

50|$|A {{quill drive}} is a {{mechanism}} that allows <b>a</b> drive <b>shaft</b> to shift its position (either axially, ly, or both) relative to its driving shaft. It consists of <b>a</b> hollow driving <b>shaft</b> (the quill) with <b>a</b> driven <b>shaft</b> inside it. The two are connected {{in some fashion}} which permits the required motion.|$|R
5|$|Stage directors, unaided by {{post-production}} {{effects and}} camera tricks, have used other methods {{to depict the}} ghost. In the late 19th century, elaborate productions of the play staged by Henry Irving employed {{a wide variety of}} approaches for this task. In 1877 a green silhouette was used to create a ghostlike image; ten years later a trick chair was used to allow an actor to appear {{in the middle of the}} scene, and then again from the midst of the audience. In 1895 <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> of blue light served to indicate the presence of Banquo's spirit. In 1933 a Russian director named Theodore Komisarjevsky staged a modern retelling of the play (Banquo and Macbeth were told of their future through palmistry); he used Macbeth's shadow as the ghost. In 1936 Orson Welles directed the Federal Theatre Project production of the play, with an African-American cast that included Canada Lee in the role of Banquo.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the 65 numbered tombs in the Valley of the Kings {{can be considered as}} minor tombs, either because at present they have yielded little information or because the results of their investigations were only poorly recorded by their explorers. Some have received very little attention or were only cursorily noted. Most of these tombs are small, often consisting of only a single burial chamber accessed by <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> or staircase with a corridor or a series of corridors leading to the chamber. But some are larger, multiple-chambered tombs. These minor tombs served various purposes: some were intended for burials of lesser royalty or private burials, some contained animal burials, and others apparently never received a primary burial. In many cases these tombs also served secondary functions, and later intrusive material has been found related to these secondary activities. While some of these tombs have been open since antiquity, the majority were discovered in the 19th and early 20th centuries during the height of exploration in the valley.|$|E
