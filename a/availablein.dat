The US Department of Health and Human Services(HHS) populates a publicly available dashboard called, the Health System Measurement Project (healthmeasures.aspe.hhs.gov), to ensure a robust monitoring system. The dashboard captures the access, quality and cost of care; overall population health; and health system dynamics (e.g., workforce, innovation, health information technology).

50|$|One area of {{controversy}} surrounding casinos is {{their relationship to}} crime rates. Economic studies that show {{a positive relationship between}} casinos and crime usually fail to consider the visiting population at risk when they calculate the crime rate in casino areas. Such studies thus count the crimes committed by visitors, but do not count visitors in the population measure, and this overstates the crime rates in casino areas. Part of the reason this methodology is used, despite it leading to an overstatement of crime rates is that reliable data on tourist count are often not <b>available.In</b> a 2004 report by the US Department of Justice, researchers interviewed people who had been arrested in Las Vegas and Des Moines and found that the percentage of problem or pathological gamblers among the arrestees was three to five times higher than in the general population. According to some police reports, incidences of reported crime often double and triple in communities within three years of a casino opening.|$|E

50|$|Proteins may be {{classified}} according to both structural and sequence similarity. For structural classification, the sizes and spatial arrangements of secondary structures {{described in the}} above paragraph are compared in known three-dimensional structures.Classification based on sequence similarity was historically {{the first to be}} used. Initially, similarity based on alignments of whole sequences was performed. Later, proteins were classified {{on the basis of the}} occurrence of conserved amino acid patterns. Databases that classify proteins by one or more of these schemes are <b>available.In</b> considering protein classification schemes, it is important to keep several observations in mind. First, two entirely different protein sequences from different evolutionary origins may fold into a similar structure. Conversely, the sequence of an ancient gene for a given structure may have diverged considerably in different species while at the same time maintaining the same basic structural features. Recognizing any remaining sequence similarity in such cases may be a very difficult task. Second, two proteins that share a significant degree of sequence similarity either with each other or with a third sequence also share an evolutionary origin and should share some structural features also. However, gene duplication and genetic rearrangements during evolution may give rise to new gene copies, which can then evolve into proteins with new function and structure.|$|E
5000|$|The Telecaster was {{important}} {{in the evolution of}} country, electric blues, funk, rock and roll, and other forms of popular music. Its solid construction let guitarists play loudly as a lead instrument, with long sustain if desired. It produced less of the uncontrolled, whistling, 'hard' feedback ('microphonic feedback') that hollowbodied instruments tend to produce at volume (different from the controllable feedback later explored by Pete Townshend and countless other players). Even though the Telecaster is {{more than half a century}} old, and more sophisticated designs have appeared since the early 1950s (including Fender's own Stratocaster), the Telecaster remains in production. There have been numerous variations and modifications, but a model with something close to the original features has always been <b>available.In</b> a recent article for Music Aficionado, Alex Lifeson of Rush wrote [...] "I bought a reissue 1959 Telecaster back in 1981, and that guitar has since become my primary writing guitar for all of these years, especially for the electric work. Every time I pick it up, it feels like an old friend. I took all of the finish off of the neck, so it’s raw wood, and I feel very connected to it when I’m playing it. That is my number-one “go to” for writing new music." ...|$|E
50|$|The main {{strength}} of a book cipher is the key. The sender and receiver of encoded messages can agree to use any book or other publication available {{to both of them}} as the key to their cipher. Someone intercepting the message and attempting to decode it, unless they are a skilled cryptographer (see Security below), must somehow identify the key from a huge number of possibilities <b>available.In</b> the context of espionage, a book cipher has a considerable advantage for a spy in enemy territory. A conventional codebook, if discovered by the local authorities, instantly incriminates the holder as a spy and gives the authorities the chance of deciphering the code and sending false messages impersonating the agent. On the other hand, a book, if chosen carefully to fit with the spy's cover story, would seem entirely innocuous.The drawback to a book cipher is that both parties have to possess an identical copy of the key. The book must not be of the sort that would look out of place in the possession of those using it and it must be of a type likely to contain any words required. Thus, for example, a spy wishing to send information about troop movements and numbers of armaments would be unlikely to find a cookery book or a romantic novel useful keys.|$|E

This consortium examined Illumina HiSeq, Life Technologies SOLiD and Roche 454 platforms at multiple laboratory sites regarding RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) performance. Within this project standard approaches to assess, report and compare the technical performance of genome-scale differential gene expression experiments have been defined. For analyzing the structural variation of the DNA, Sepp Hochreiter's {{research group}} proposed [...] "cn.MOPS: mixture of Poissons for discovering copy number variations in next-generation data with a low false discovery rate"for detecting copy number variations in next generation sequencing data. cn.MOPS estimates the local DNA copy number, is suited for both whole genome sequencing and exom sequencing,and {{can be applied to}} diploid and haploid genomes but also to polyploid genomes. For identifying differential expressed transcripts in RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) data, Sepp Hochreiter's group suggested [...] "DEXUS: Identifying Differential Expression in RNA-Seq Studies with Unknown Conditions". In contrast to other RNA-seq methods, DEXUS can detect differential expression in RNA-seq data for which the sampleconditions are unknown and for which biological replicates are not <b>available.In</b> the group of Sepp Hochreiter, sequencing data was analyzed to gain insights into chromatin remodeling. Thereorganization of the cell's chromatin structure was determined via next-generation sequencing of resting and activated T cells.

5000|$|Noise also {{presents}} a fairly common workplace hazard: {{occupational hearing loss}} {{is the most common}} work-related injury in the United States, with 22 million workers exposed to hazardous noise levels at work and an estimated $242 million spent annually on worker's compensation for hearing loss disability. Noise is not the only source of occupational hearing loss; exposure to chemicals such as aromatic solvents and metals including lead, arsenic, and mercury can also cause hearing loss. Naturally, noise is more of concern for certain occupations than others; musicians, mine workers, and construction workers [...] are exposed to higher and more constant levels of noise and therefore are at a higher risk of developing hearing loss. Since noise-induced hearing loss, while entirely preventable, is permanent and irreversible, it is vital that companies and their employees are aware of limits and prevention methods <b>available.In</b> the United States, noise is recognized as a hazard in the workplace by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Both organizations work to set and enforce standards for occupational noise exposure and ultimately prevent hearing loss. Examples of initiatives made by NIOSH to prevent the negative effects of noise exposure include the Buy Quiet program, which encourages employers to purchase machinery that produces lower noise levels, and the Safe-In-Sound Award, which was created to recognize organizations that excel in noise control.|$|E
