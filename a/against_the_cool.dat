At the beginning of the 20th century, Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubist Georges Braque, André Derain, Raoul Dufy and Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with [...] "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism. Matisse's second version of The Dance signified a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting. It reflected Matisse's incipient fascination with primitive art: the intense warm color of the figures <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of the dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and hedonism.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concentration}} must {{be minimal}} {{to prevent the}} absorption of the photons into the gas {{in the form of}} heat. This absorption happens when two atoms collide with each other while one of them has an excited electron.

This works <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> process and therefore limits the maximum concentration of gas that can be cooled using this method.|$|R

Allie {{lay in the}} dark, listening to Benton's strange wailing roar, sad, yet hideous, and out {{of what she had}} seen and heard, and from the mournful message on the night wind, she realized how closely associated were gold and evil and men, and how inevitably they must lead to lawlessness and to bloodshed and to death.|$|R
40|$|ASCA {{observations}} of central regions of cD clusters have yielded three important {{pieces of evidence}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> ow hypothesis. Firstly, the excess X-ray surface brightness around cD galaxies {{has been found to}} result from a hierarchical structure in the gravitational potential, rather than from radiative <b>cooling</b> of <b>the</b> X-ray emitting gas. Secondly, <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> emission from core regions of cD clusters has been measured to be signicantly less luminous than was estimated in the past. Finally, an increase in the overall gas metallicity and changes in the chemical composition have been detected in the central regions of several cD clusters; neither of these can be explained by <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> ow scenario. When combined with several additional ASCA results, these ndings suggest that the origin of <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> X-ray component is tightly related to cD galaxies, rather than to putative cooling ows. These discoveries have well preceded the recent achievements with XMM-Newton and Chandra. A semi-quantitative idea is presented to explain the lack of massive cooling ows, {{based on the assumption that}} kinetic energies of member galaxies (including their dark halos) is dissipated on the plasma heating through magnetohydrodynamic eects...|$|R

60|$|Somebody {{was leaning}} {{out of my}} bedroom window, {{refreshing}} his forehead <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> stone of the parapet, and feeling the air upon his face. It was myself. I was addressing myself as 'Copperfield', and saying, 'Why {{did you try to}} smoke? You might have known you couldn't do it.'

I was very pale in the looking-glass; my eyes had a vacant appearance; and my hair--only my hair, nothing else--looked drunk.|$|E

She dipped the end of the towel in the water-jug and {{refreshed}} her eyes with the cool water. She looked at herself in profile and readjusted a hairpin above her ear. Then she went back to the bed again and sat at the foot. She regarded the pillows for a long time and the sight of them awakened in her mind secret, amiable memories. She rested the nape of her neck <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> iron bed-rail and fell into a reverie. There was no longer any perturbation visible on her face.|$|E
40|$|Direct Laser Deposition (DLD) {{introduces}} steep {{thermal gradients}} into components {{due to the}} localised, high temperature melt region created by the laser heat source. This causes local thermal expansion and plastic deformation during heating and leads to a permanent change in the geometry of the component. There is also {{an effect on the}} microstructure and therefore mechanical properties. In this study, temperature measurements were taken across a substrate during DLD repair, under varying controlled thermal conditions This data was used to calculate <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> rates at different locations, and these were correlated to the observed distortion of the substrate and changes in microstructure. It was found that cooling rate varied significantly at the outer edges of the substrate but hardly at all near the processing area, indicating that while the thermal gradient across the plate will affect distortion, it has little effect on microstructure. The measured distortion was plotted <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> rate in <b>the</b> same location, showing evidence of an inverse binomial form relationship. Despite the relatively small size of the study this is an indicator of how the DLD process can be developed further...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new measuring technique for the {{heat transfer coefficient}} during condensation inside a 1. 4 mm hydraulic diameter multiport minichannel tube. It also reports experimental data taken during condensation of R 134 a. The tube wall temperature is directly measured, so as to obtain the saturation to wall temperature difference and thus the internal heat transfer coefficient in a direct form. The test section presented here is made of three counter-flow heat exchangers. It is realized with one 1. 8 m long multiport tube and three separated jackets. The refrigerant condenses in <b>the</b> minichannels <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> water flowing in the jackets. The actual measuring sector is the third heat exchanger, considering the refrigerant flow direction. The other two heat exchangers are only used to achieve the desired value of vapor quality. The test section has been designed {{with the purpose of}} achieving both high water-side heat transfer coefficients and good mixing of <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> water during tests. The final design {{is the result of the}} Finite Volume Method modeling and prototype testing. The tests showed that the measured heat transfer coefficient does not depend on the water side coefficient...|$|R
60|$|First {{he came to}} the Park, whose sombre {{woodland}} {{seemed to}} fascinate him. He leaned wearily up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> railings, <b>cooling</b> his brow <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wet metal, and listening to the tremulous silence of the trees. 'Murder! murder!' he kept repeating, as though iteration could dim the horror of the word. The sound of his own voice made him shudder, yet he almost hoped that Echo might hear him, and wake the slumbering city from its dreams. He felt a mad desire to stop the casual passer-by, and tell him everything.|$|R
60|$|I {{turned to}} the window again, and pressed my brow <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> glass. She was right.

To do the thing that had been in my mind would be not only to destroy myself, but to defile her; for upon her would recoil a portion of the odium that must be flung at me. And--as she said--what then must be her position? They would even have a case upon which to drag her from these walls of Pagliano. She would be a victim of the civil courts; she might, at Pier Luigi's instigation, be proceeded against as my accomplice in what would be accounted a dastardly murder for the basest of motives.|$|E

A few hasty preparations had been made, {{in order to protect the}} females <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> airs of the coming night; and, in short, all was done that the intelligence of a border-man could suggest, or his exceeding readiness in expedients could in so brief a space supply.|$|E
60|$|When I {{came home}} to dinner my uncle {{had not yet been}} home. Still it was early. I sat staring at the clock for some time and, when its ticking began to irritate me, I left the room. I mounted the {{staircase}} and gained {{the upper part of the}} house. The high cold empty gloomy rooms liberated me and I went from room to room singing. From the front window I saw my companions playing below in the street. Their cries reached me weakened and indistinct and, leaning my forehead <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> glass, I looked over at the dark house where she lived. I may have stood there for an hour, seeing nothing but the brown-clad figure cast by my imagination, touched discreetly by the lamplight at the curved neck, at the hand upon the railings and at the border below the dress.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{observed}} rapid <b>cooling</b> of <b>the</b> Cassiopeia A {{neutron star}} {{can be interpreted}} as being caused by neutron and proton transitions from normal to superfluid and superconducting states in the stellar core. Here we present two new Chandra ACIS-S Graded observations of this neutron star and measurements of the neutron star mass M and radius R found from consistent fitting of both the X-ray spectra and cooling behavior. This comparison is only possible for individual nuclear equations of state. We test phenomenological superfluid and superconducting gap models which mimic many of the known theoretical models <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> behavior. Our best-fit solution to the Cassiopeia A data is one in which the (M,R) = (1. 44 Msun, 12. 6 km) neutron star is built with the BSk 21 equation of state, strong proton superconductor and moderate neutron triplet superfluid gap models, and a pure iron envelope or a thin carbon layer on top of an iron envelope, although there are still large observational and theoretical uncertainties.

The second objective of this project is to compare the calculated heat gain <b>against</b> <b>the</b> existing <b>cooling</b> capacity. In this project, Block W, UMP was chosen as the case study. The floor plan of Block W is first studied to review the building specifications.

"No {{chance to}} speed a horse here, of course," [...] said Lapham, while the horse with a {{spirited}} gentleness picked her way, with a high, long action, over the pavement of the street.

The air was full of a smell pleasantly compounded of oakum, of leather, and of oil. It was not the busy season, and they met only two or three trucks heavily straggling toward the wharf with their long string teams; but the cobble-stones of the pavement were worn with the dint of ponderous wheels, and discoloured with iron-rust from them; here and there, in wandering streaks over its surface, was the grey stain of the salt water with which the street had been sprinkled.|$|E
60|$|The {{train was}} late, {{and it was}} past ten o'clock when they at last {{appeared}} before the concierge of Helen's home. During their journey, and while passing though the crowds at the station and in the streets, Ostrander had exhibited a new and grave guardianship over the young girl, and, on the first landing, after a scrutinizing and an almost fierce glance at {{one or two of}} Helen's odd fellow lodgers, he had extended his protection so far as to accompany her up the four flights to the landing of her apartment. Here he took leave of her with a grave courtesy that half pained, half pleased her. She watched his broad shoulders and dangling sleeve as he went down the stairs, and then quickly turned, entered her room, and locked the door. The smile had faded from her lips. Going to the window, she pressed her hot forehead <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> glass and looked out upon the stars nearly level with the black roofs around her. She stood there some moments until another star appeared higher up against the roof ridge, the star she was looking for. But here the glass pane before her eyes became presently dim with moisture; she was obliged to rub it out with her handkerchief; yet, somehow, it soon became clouded, at which she turned sharply away and went to bed.|$|E
6000|$|Milan, October.--My journey hither {{was such}} a {{pleasant}} piece of traveller's luck that I feel a delicacy for taking it to pieces {{to see what it}} was made of. Do what we will, however, there remains in all deeply agreeable impressions a charming something we can't analyse. I found it agreeable even, given the rest of my case, to turn out of bed, at Lucerne, by four o'clock, into the chilly autumn darkness. The thick-starred sky was cloudless, and there was as yet no flush of dawn; but the lake was wrapped in a ghostly white mist which crept halfway up the mountains and made them look as if they too had been lying down for the night and were casting away the vaporous tissues of their bedclothes. Into this fantastic fog the little steamer went creaking away, and I hung about the deck with the two or three travellers who had known better than to believe it would save them francs or midnight sighs--over those debts you [...] "pay with your person"--to go and wait for the diligence at the Poste at Fliielen, or yet at the Guillaume Tell. The dawn came sailing up over the mountain-tops, flushed but unperturbed, and blew out the little stars and then the big ones, as a thrifty matron after a party blows out her candles and lamps; the mist went melting and wandering away into the duskier hollows and recesses of the mountains, and the summits defined their profiles <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> soft light.|$|E
5000|$|ISASMELT lances contain {{one or more}} devices called [...] "swirlers" [...] {{that cause}} the {{injected}} gas to spin within the lance, forcing it <b>against</b> <b>the</b> lance wall, <b>cooling</b> it. <b>The</b> <b>cooling</b> effect results in a layer of slag [...] "freezing" [...] {{on the outside of}} the lance. This layer of solid slag protects the lance from the high temperatures inside the furnace. The tip of the lance that is submerged in the bath eventually wears out, and the worn lance is easily replaced with a new one when necessary. The worn tips are subsequently cut off and a new tip welded onto the lance body before it is returned to the furnace.|$|R
30|$|DCMD {{is one of}} the {{simplest}} MD configurations and has been widely studied (Ashoor et al. 2016). In this configuration, a concentrated hot feed solution is in direct contact with one side of the membrane and a cold permeate is in direct contact with {{the opposite side of the}} membrane. The vapour molecules migrate through the membrane pores and condenses at the permeate side and is removed with the permeate (Burgoyne and Vahdati 2000; Khayet et al. 2005; Ashoor et al. 2016). AGMD is similar to DCMD; however, the permeate side is separated by an air gap (Guo et al. 2017). This results in an increase in mass and heat transfer. <b>The</b> product condenses <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> plate and is removed (Ashoor et al. 2016; Bogler et al. 2017). SGMD has a configuration similar to AGMD; however, an inert gas typically air is used to remove the vapour molecules. A condenser is used to condense the vapour molecules into condensate product. VMD is similar to SGMD; however, vacuum conditions are used in the process. Some of the advantages of DCMD are that it is simple in its design, no external equipment such as condensers is required and condensation of the permeate occurs inside the membrane module (El-Bourawi et al. 2006; Gullinkala et al. 2010; AlHathal Al-Anezi et al. 2013; Ashoor et al. 2016; Bogler et al. 2017; Eykens et al. 2017). DCMD is therefore investigated further in this study.|$|R
40|$|Sperm surface binding {{sites for}} non-zinc-binding {{proteins}} (nZnBPs) and zinc-binding proteins (ZnBPs) were studied by the fluorescence technique with biotin-labelled proteins. The nZnBPs binding pattern was unspecific, no characteristic sites on plasmalemma were found. ZnBPs were attached {{mainly to the}} acrosomal region of sperm head and to the sperm flagellum. ZnBPs added to the incubation mixture of the canine spermatozoa allowed the preservation of higher values for total motility, progressive motility, curvilinear line velocity, straight line velocity, and beat cross frequency (P < 0. 05), both at time 0 and after 1 h incubation at 5 ºC. The addition of nZnBPs to the incubation mixture caused only weak positive effects when compared with control sample (PBS). A higher percentage of canine-ejaculated spermatozoa with intact membranes were observed when ejaculate was incubated with ZnBPs in comparison to control sample stored with PBS (P < 0. 05) or nZnBPs (P < 0. 05). Spermatozoa diluted with ZnBPs and nZnBPs exhibited {{a higher percentage of}} cells with active mitochondria when compared with control, both at time 0 and after 1 h; however, no statistical differences were observed. Our results emphasise the role of seminal plasma protein in securing the correct quantity and availability of zinc ions as a component regulating the motility of canine spermatozoa. The protective effect of ZnBPs <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> effect may be due to their ability of preventing sperm membrane damage...|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} still regarded on {{the face}} before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a flair, for the cruder things of life. A scene disengages itself in the observer's memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures. A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock. And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> ardent fruit.

40|$|Mafic {{enclaves}} {{hosted by}} andesite erupted at the Soufrière Hills Volcano between 1995 and 2010 yield insights into syn-eruptive mafic underplating of an andesite magma reservoir, magma mixing {{and its role}} in sustaining eruptions that may be widely applicable in volcanic arc settings. The mafic enclaves range in composition from basalt to andesite and are generated from a hybrid thermal boundary layer at the interface between the two magmas, where <b>the</b> basalt quenches <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooler</b> andesite, and <b>the</b> two magmas mix. We show, using an analytical model, that the enclaves are generated when the hybrid layer, just a few tens of centimetres thick, becomes buoyant and forms plumes which rise up into the andesite. Mafic enclave geochemistry suggests that vapour-saturated basalt was underplated quasi-continuously throughout the first three eruptive phases of the eruption (the end member basalt became more Mg and V-rich over time). The andesite erupted during the final phases of the eruption contained more abundant and larger enclaves, and the enclaves were more extensively hybridised with the andesite, suggesting that at some time during the final few years of the eruption, the intrusion of mafic magma at depth ceased, allowing the hybrid layer to reach a greater thickness, generating larger mafic enclaves. The temporal trends in mafic enclave composition and abundance suggests that basalt recharge and underplating sustained the eruption by the transfer of heat and volatiles across the interface and when the recharge ceased, the eruption waned. Our study has important implications for the petrological monitoring of long-lived arc eruptions...|$|R

40|$|This study directs {{attention}} {{towards the}} New Cairo community, {{which is one}} of the new urban settlements that have been developed around Cairo, Egypt. People recently have tended to install or extend mechanical cooling equipment in their dwellings in order to overcome the problem of thermal discomfort from overheating. Although <b>the</b> mechanical <b>cooling</b> significantly raises utilities bills, it is still the preferred choice for the majority of the residents. The lack of awareness about the advantages of Passive Cooling Techniques (PCT), in addition to uncertain about their costs and effectiveness, has made PCT unpopular options for both designers and owners. This study investigates the costs and benefits of two PCT, which include the influence of the thermal transmittance of the walls (U-value), and the attachment of solar shading devices. The Whole Life Cycle Costing (WLCC) evaluation method is used to estimate the payback period of applying the PCT. The PCT were simulated using the dynamic thermal simulation software DesignBuilder to investigate their thermal performance and estimate <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> load energy savings. The purpose of this paper is to compare <b>the</b> mechanical <b>cooling</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> passive <b>cooling</b> alternatives from a financial viability standpoint to enable appropriate solutions to be chosen at the early stages of a design.
