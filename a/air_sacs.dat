5|$|Anatomical dissections of two brown {{pelicans}} in 1939 {{showed that}} pelicans have {{a network of}} subcutaneous <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> under their skin situated across the ventral surface including the throat, breast and undersides of the wings, as well as having <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> in their bones. The <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> {{are connected to the}} airways of the respiratory system, and the pelican can keep its <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> inflated by closing its glottis, {{but it is not clear}} how <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> are inflated. The <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> serve to keep the pelican remarkably buoyant in the water and may also cushion the impact of the pelican's body on the water surface when they dive from flight into water to catch fish. Superficial <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> may also help to round body contours (especially over the abdomen where surface protuberances may be caused by viscera changing size and position) to enable the overlying feathers to form more effective heat insulation and also to enable feathers to be held in position for good aerodynamics.|$|E
5|$|The <b>air</b> <b>sacs,</b> which hold air, do not {{contribute}} much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, {{as they are}} poorly vascularised. The <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> expand and contract due {{to changes in the}} volume in the thorax and abdomen. This volume change is caused by the movement of the sternum and ribs and this movement is often synchronised with movement of the flight muscles.|$|E

40|$|Ten sulphur-crested {{cockatoos}} (Cacatua galerita) were anesthetized twice, 2 weeks apart, {{to evaluate}} the effects on respiratory function of endotracheal (ET), caudal thoracic (CT) <b>air</b> <b>sac,</b> and clavicular <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> administration of isoflurane anesthesia. Four administration methods were evaluated by administering anesthetic gases through either the ET tube or the <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> as an open or closed system. Respiratory function was monitored by arterial and venous blood gas determination, gas-in-gas determination of both ET tube and <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> gases, and spirometry. Both ET tube and CT <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> administration provided a reliable method of maintaining anesthesia and resulted in minimal alteration in respiratory function. Blood pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO 2), bicarbonate, total carbon dioxide, and base excess were not significantly altered by CT <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> administration. Increased partial pressure of oxygen and oxygen saturation were evidence of hyperoxia. CT <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> PCO 2 decreased to 12. 7 ± 7. 9 mm Hg with CT administration, and this was sufficient to maintain spontaneous respiratory movements. Spirometry demonstrated maintenance of tidal and minute volumes with each administration method despite apparent reduction in visible respiratory movements. Clavicular <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> administration was not successful in providing ventilation or maintaining anesthesia. Despite the demonstrated ability to flush a bolus of gas through this <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> and out the ET tube, no spontaneous ventilation was detected in this <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> in either an open or closed system, preventing delivery of sufficient isoflurane to maintain anesthesia...|$|R

5|$|Daniela Schwarz {{and colleagues}} (2007) {{concluded}} that the bifurcated neural spines of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an <b>air</b> <b>sac,</b> {{which would have been}} connected to the lungs as part of the respiratory system. In Dicraeosaurus, this <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> (the so-called supravertebral diverticulum) would have rested on top of the neural arch and filled the entire space between the spines. In Amargasaurus the upper two-thirds of the spines would have been covered by a sheath of keratin, restricting the <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> to the space between the lower one-third of the spines.|$|R
5|$|In saurischian dinosaurs, higher metabolisms were {{supported}} by {{the evolution of the}} avian respiratory system, characterized by an extensive system of <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> that extended the lungs and invaded many of the bones in the skeleton, making them hollow. Early avian-style respiratory systems with <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> may have been capable of sustaining higher activity levels than mammals of similar size and build could sustain. In addition to providing a very efficient supply of oxygen, the rapid airflow would have been an effective cooling mechanism, which is essential for animals that are active but too large {{to get rid of all}} the excess heat through their skin.|$|E

5|$|Both {{crocodilians}} {{and monitor}} lizards have developed lungs {{similar to those}} of birds, providing an unidirectional airflow and even possessing <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b> The now extinct pterosaurs have seemingly even further refined this type of lung, extending the airsacs into the wing membranes and, in the case of lonchodectids, tupuxuara, and azhdarchoids, the hindlimbs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Contrast {{radiography}} with positive-pressure insufflation (PPI) at 20 cm {{of water}} pres-sure was evaluated {{for safety and}} analyzed for potential diagnostic use in 6 male northern pintails {Anas acuta). Ducks were anesthetized for either 2 or 3 procedures, 1 week apart, then euthanized and necropsied after the final procedure. <b>Air</b> <b>sac</b> areas on survey and PPI radiographs were measured to calculate average percent increase of visible <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> area after PPI. No clinical complications resulted from PPI procedures. Birds recovered quickly without respiratory distress. No gross or microscopic respiratory lesions associated with PPI were identified at necropsy. Average percent increases in <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> areas resulting from PPI on lateral and ventrodorsal radiographs were 79 % and 90 %, respectively. As judged subjectively by attending clinical veterinarians, cardiohepatic, <b>air</b> <b>sac,</b> lung, renal, gastrointestinal, vertebral, and testicular margins and boundaries were more distinct {{as a result of}} PPI.

40|$|Abstract Song {{in birds}} is {{produced}} as air flows past the vibratory {{structures of the}} syrinx typically during expiration. Whereas there is detailed information about bilateral syringeal contributions to sound production, little is known of the interactions of <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> pressure and airflow, and how these affect sound frequency and sound amplitude. We studied <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> pressure and airflow during song in brown-headed cowbirds, cardinals and zebra finches, three species with acoustically dissimilar songs. Results revealed no consistent relationship between <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> pressure and airflow during song syllables with different acoustic structure, suggesting that adjustments in syringeal resistance {{play an important role}} in airflow regulation. In cowbirds and zebra finches, high frequency sounds were produced with higher <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> pressure. In these same species, sound amplitude appears to be greater for high than low frequency sounds, suggesting greater efficiency in transforming fluid dynamic energy into acoustic energy...|$|R

Lacking vocal cords, they produce sounds using six <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> near their blow hole. Each animal has a uniquely identifying, frequency-modulated narrow-band signature vocalization (signature whistle).|$|E
5|$|Bats may avoid flying {{during the}} day to prevent {{overheating}} in the sun, since their dark wing-membranes absorb solar radiation. Bats {{may not be able}} to dissipate heat if the ambient temperature is too high. Unlike birds which have <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> or other mammals which have sweat glands, bats have no means to cool themselves by evaporation, though they may use saliva to cool themselves in an emergency.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} hadrosaurids, Edmontosaurus lacked a bony crest. It {{may have had}} soft-tissue display {{structures}} in the skull, though: the bones around the nasal openings had deep indentations surrounding the openings, and this pair of recesses are postulated to have held inflatable <b>air</b> <b>sacs,</b> perhaps allowing for both visual and auditory signaling. Edmontosaurus may have been dimorphic, with more robust and more lightly built forms, {{but it has not}} been established if this is related to sexual dimorphism.|$|E

5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung) is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. An easy to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural space.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} nasal arch of Gryposaurus, {{like other}} cranial modifications in duckbills, {{may have been}} used for a variety of social functions, such as identification of sexes or species and social ranking. It could also have functioned as a tool for broadside pushing or butting in social contests, and there may have been inflatable <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> flanking it for both visual and auditory signaling. The top of the arch is roughened in some specimens, suggesting that it was covered by thick, keratinized skin, or that there was a cartilaginous extension.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians were {{traditionally}} {{thought to}} breathe like mammals, with airflow {{moving in and}} out tidally, but studies published in 2010 and 2013 conclude that crocodilians breathe more like birds, with airflow moving in a unidirectional loop within the lungs. When a crocodilian inhales, air flows through the trachea and into two primary bronchi, or airways, which branch off into narrower secondary passageways. The air continues to move through these, then into even narrower tertiary airways, and then into other secondary airways which were bypassed the first time. The air then flows back into the primary airways and is exhaled back out. These aerodynamic valves within the bronchial tree have been hypothesised to explain how crocodilians can have unidirectional airflow without the aid of avian-like <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b>|$|E

Frogs produce sound from the <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> below their mouth that from the outside, is seen to inflate and deflate.

In this study the impact of the use of different inoculation routes and immunosuppression on the course of an infection with Aspergillus fumigatus in racing pigeons (Columba livia domestica) was examined. A. fumigatus conidia were inoculated in the thoracic <b>air</b> <b>sac,</b> lung or trachea in immunocompetent or immunosuppressed pigeon squabs. Immunosuppression was induced by three dexamethasone injections before inoculation. Mortality in the A. fumigatus inoculated groups varied between 1 / 4 to 4 / 4.

In conclusion, inoculation in the lung is selected as the preferred model for chronic aspergillosis in pigeons and inoculation in the thoracic <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> as the one for acute aspergillosis.

5|$|The {{cervical}} vertebrae of Apatosaurus {{are less}} elongated and more heavily constructed {{than those of}} Diplodocus, a diplodocid like Apatosaurus, and {{the bones of the}} leg are much stockier despite being longer, implying that Apatosaurus was a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. Apatosaurus had a single claw on each forelimb and three on each hindlimb. The Apatosaurus skull, long thought to be similar to Camarasaurus, is much more similar to that of Diplodocus. Apatosaurus was a generalized browser that likely held its head elevated. To lighten its vertebrae, Apatosaurus had <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> that made the bones internally full of holes. Like that of other diplodocids, its tail may have been used as a whip to create loud noises.|$|E

5|$|The major {{function}} of the lungs is gas exchange between the lungs and the blood. The alveolar and pulmonary capillary gases equilibrate across the blood–air barrier, a very thin diffusion membrane which is only, on average, about 2μm thick, consisting of {{the walls of the}} pulmonary alveoli, consisting of the alveolar epithelial cells, their basement membranes and the endothelial cells of the pulmonary capillaries. This membrane is folded into about 300 million small <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> called alveoli (each between 75 and 300µm in diameter) branching off from the bronchioles in the lungs, thus providing an extremely large surface area (estimates varying between 70 and 145m2) for gas exchange to occur.|$|E
40|$|Inoculation of 200 mean egg {{infectious}} doses (EID 50) of lentogenic Newcastle disease {{virus strain}} B 1 (NDV-B 1) into the <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> of 4 -day-old specific-pathogen-free chicks provided significant protection against {{challenge of the}} <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> with 100 chicken mean lethal doses (LD 50) of velogenic NDV-H but no protection against reinfection when the challenge was by the eye. Conversely, inoculation of the eye with 200 EID 50 of NDV-B 1 provided significant protection against challenge of the eye but not of the <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> with 100 chicken LD 50 of NDV-H. Birds that received both antiserum and intraocular immunization were subsequently protected against both eye and air-sac challenge. On the other hand, birds that received antiserum and air-sac immunization were protected only against air-sac challenge but not against ocular challenge. Low levels of passively administered antibody did not prevent infection of the eye or <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> but greatly reduced the mortality rate after inoculation of either the vaccine or the challenge viruses. Passively administered antibody also suppressed hemagglutination-inhibiting and virus-neutralizing antibody formation stimulated by air-sac infection but not antibody formation stimulated by ocular infection.

5|$|The ribs were {{connected}} to the dorsal (trunk) vertebrae with two joints, acting together as a simple hinge joint, which has allowed researchers to reconstruct the inhaled and exhaled positions of the ribcage. The difference in volume between these two positions defines the air exchange volume (the amount of air moved with each breath), determined to be approximately 20L for a P.engelhardti individual estimated to have weighed690kg, or 29mL/kg bodyweight. This is a typical value for birds, but not for mammals, and indicates that Plateosaurus probably had an avian-style flow-through lung, although indicators for postcranial pneumaticity (<b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> of the lung invading the bones to reduce weight) {{can be found on}} the bones of only a few individuals, and were only recognized in 2010. Combined with evidence from bone histology this indicates that Plateosaurus was endothermic.|$|E
5|$|All the {{vertebrae}} {{were highly}} pneumatised by invading <b>air</b> <b>sacs,</b> {{except for the}} atlas bone and the hindmost tail vertebrae, and were thereby connected to the respiratory system. The back vertebrae were as pneumatised as those of sauropod dinosaurs, and had an extensive system of depressions. These adaptations may be correlated with gigantism, as they reduce weight. The six vertebrae of the sacrum were also tall and pneumatised, and all but the first one were fused together at the top, their neural spines forming a neural plate. The ilium, the top hip bone, was also partially pneumatised close to the sacral vertebrae. Part of the pelvis was hypertrophied (enlarged) compared to other ornithomimosaurs, to support {{the weight of the}} animal with strong muscle attachments. The front hip bones tilted upwards in life. The tail of Deinocheirus ended in at least two fused vertebrae, which were described as similar to the pygostyle of oviraptorosaurian and therizinosauroid theropods. Ornithomimosaurs are known to have had pennaceous feathers, so this feature suggests that they might have had a fan of feathers at the tail end.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} skull, the {{skeleton}} of Istiodactylus was {{similar to those of}} other ornithocheiroid pterosaurs. The vertebral column, forelimb, and trunk bones were pneumatised by <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b> The neural arches of the vertebrae had tall, sloping laminae. The notarium (a structure consisting of fused vertebrae in the shoulder-region of some pterosaurs and birds) consisted of six fused trunk vertebrae, with their neural spines fused into a plate, on which the shoulder blades articulated with a depression on each side. The main part of the sternum was very deep, with a bowed front edge and a shallow, triangular keel. The facets of the sternum that contacted with the coracoids were saddle-shaped and arranged asymmetrically. The humerus (upper arm bone) was stout and had a sharply curved deltopectoral crest. The forelimbs of istiodactylids were large, up to 4.5 times longer than their legs. The long wing-finger may have occupied 50 percent of the wing-skeleton. The hindlimbs were short compared to the forelimbs, and the feet were as long as the small third finger.|$|E

One day post-inoculation, <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> membranes were multifocally and moderately to severely thickened by an edema and covered by an exudate.
