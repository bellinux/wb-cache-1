5|$|Many SCI {{patients}} have received misinformation {{about the effects}} of their injury on their sexual function and benefit from education about it. Although sexual education shortly after injury is known to be helpful <b>and</b> <b>desired,</b> it is frequently missing in rehabilitation settings; a common complaint from those who go through rehabilitation programs is that they offer insufficient information about sexuality. Longer-term education and counseling on sex after discharge from a hospital setting are especially important, yet sexuality {{is one of the most}} often neglected areas in long-term SCI rehabilitation, particularly for women. Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped to handle it. Clinicians must be circumspect in bringing up sexual matters since people may be uncomfortable with or unready for the subject. Many patients wait for providers to broach the topic even if they do want the information.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding the General Assembly's {{attempt to}} promote peace and unity, two {{distinct}} factions, the Old School and the New School, developed through the 1820s over {{the issues of}} confessional subscription, revivalism, {{and the spread of}} New England theology.

5|$|Phenotypic traits can be {{displayed}} in one sex <b>and</b> <b>desired</b> {{in the other}} sex, causing a positive feedback loop called a Fisherian runaway, for example, the extravagant plumage of some male birds such as the peacock. An alternate theory proposed by the same Ronald Fisher in 1930 is the sexy son hypothesis, that mothers want promiscuous sons to give them large numbers of grandchildren and so choose promiscuous fathers for their children. Aggression between {{members of the same}} sex is sometimes associated with very distinctive features, such as the antlers of stags, which are used in combat with other stags. More generally, intrasexual selection is often associated with sexual dimorphism, including differences in body size between males and females of a species.|$|E
5|$|The {{conservative}} Moderate {{opposition to}} Feijó had close links to coffee and sugar cane planter families and merchants in the Brazilian southeast and northeast. These groups wielded great political, {{social and economic}} influence. They began to see their interests more in alignment with men like Honório Hermeto, who were planters like themselves—people who supported the slave trade with Africa <b>and</b> <b>desired</b> a centralized state able to impose order. The often strongheaded Honório Hermeto, swallowing his pride, set aside his enmity toward Vasconcelos in pursuit of an alliance. Dubbed the Reactionary Party by Feijó and his allies in 1837, the conservative Moderate opposition born in late 1834 was the genesis of what would evolve into the Party of Order (c. 1843) and finally into the Conservative Party (c. 1853).|$|E

5|$|Fran {{once lived}} with her sisters Jote and Mjrn in Eruyt Village, the secluded Viera {{settlement}} in Golmore Jungle, but became restless <b>and</b> <b>desired</b> to see the outside world. This was {{a major source of}} conflict between her and the other viera, especially her elder sister Jote, who served as the village matriarch. Fran argued that although all Viera begin their lives in the forest, they are not necessarily bound to remain there to the end. When the party encounters an impassable Viera barrier on the path through Golmore, Fran is forced to return to the village and ask for help. She learns from Jote that their youngest sister Mjrn has run off to the nearby magicite mines. When Fran finds her and brings her back, Mjrn reveals she wishes to leave Golmore, but Fran advises her against doing so, relating how her own independence has cost her her family and the ability to commune with the Wood. Fran accepts that she is now part of the Hume world, and asks for a confirmation from Jote that the Wood accepts her before she leaves. Jote replies that The Wood misses her child and is jealous of the hume that has taken her away. Fran smiles {{for the first time in}} the game, knowing her sister is lying and still cares for her, as she leaves The Wood for good. In Revenant Wings, Balthier and Fran are searching for the Cache of Glabados. Fran was voiced by Nicole Fantl in English and by Rika Fukami in Japanese. She also appears in Itadaki Street Portable.|$|E
5|$|Luther {{also had}} {{experience}} with the indulgences connected to All Saints' Church, Wittenberg. By venerating the large collection of relics at the church, one could receive an indulgence. He had preached as early as 1514 against the abuse of indulgences {{and the way they}} cheapened grace rather than requiring true repentance. Luther became especially concerned in 1517 when his parishioners, returning from purchasing Tetzel's indulgences, claimed that they no longer needed to repent and change their lives in order to be forgiven of sin. After hearing what Tetzel had said about indulgences in his sermons, Luther began to study the issue more carefully, and contacted experts on the subject. He preached about indulgences several times in 1517, explaining that true repentance was better than purchasing an indulgence. He taught that receiving an indulgence presupposed that the penitent had confessed and repented, otherwise it was worthless. A truly repentant sinner would also not seek an indulgence, because they loved God's righteousness <b>and</b> <b>desired</b> the inward punishment of their sin. These sermons seem to have ceased from April to October 1517, presumably while Luther was writing the Ninety-five Theses. He composed a Treatise on Indulgences, apparently in early autumn 1517. It is a cautious and searching examination of the subject. He contacted church leaders on the subject by letter, including his superior , Bishop of Brandenburg, sometime on or before 31 October, when he sent the Theses to Archbishop Albert of Brandenburg.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the filming}} was completed, more than 20 two-hour Beta SP video tapes of footage {{had to be}} edited down to fit {{the actions of the}} game. The {{programming}} included editing the original video footage, and mixing the rendered images of doors, drawers, chairs and other objects into the footage frame-by-frame, which was necessary for more than 100 scenes. The game required more polishing and fine-tuning than most games of its time due to the many video components, and the programmers had to determine the desired frame rate, data transfer rate <b>and</b> <b>desired</b> resolution of the video elements. Another challenge for the game was CD resource management. Since many of the scenes in the game could be repeated in multiple chapters, some pieces of the code were written onto several different CDs {{to reduce the number of}} times the player had to swap discs in the middle of a chapter, an unusual practice for computer games at the time. The final game was on seven discs, a large number for a computer game, and more than the four or five discs originally expected.|$|E

They argue that sexuality education is clearly shaped by specific cultural and political contexts, and examine how these contexts have shaped the development of pleasure’s inclusion in such programs. Via such discussions, this volume incites a re-configuration of thought regarding sexuality education’s approach to pleasure <b>and</b> <b>desire...</b>|$|R

5|$|Some {{weeks after}} their encounter, word reached Le Gris of accusations being made against him by Carrouges and his wife. It {{will never be}} known what basis these {{allegations}} had in fact but Carrouges claimed that on 18 January 1386, whilst Carrouges was still in Paris, Le Gris had entered the chateau of Carrouges' mother Nicole and there raped Marguerite. According to Marguerite de Carrouges' testimony, a squire in Le Gris' employ named Adam Louvel had {{knocked on the door}} of the chateau and demanded entry. All the servants were attending to Dame Nicole de Carrouges, who was visiting a neighbouring town on legal business, and so Marguerite was alone when Louvel called. Once inside, Louvel gave Marguerite a message that Le Gris was outside <b>and</b> <b>desired</b> to see her because he was passionately in love with her. Although Marguerite protested, Le Gris broke into the house and propositioned her, offering money in exchange. When Marguerite refused, Le Gris attempted to take her by force and raped her on the bed in her chamber with the help of Louvel. As Le Gris departed, he threatened her with violence if she told of the encounter.|$|E
5|$|With {{the death}} of the Zhengde Emperor on April 19, 1521, {{mourning}} ceremonies were initiated that cancelled all other ceremonies, including the reception of foreign embassies. The newly appointed Grand Secretary, Yang Tinghe, soon turned against the powerful eunuch influence at court, which had grown even more powerful under the Zhengde Emperor. Although Ming officials were of the opinion that only foreign tributary states listed during the beginning of the dynasty should be accepted at court, it was the eunuchs who wanted to expand commercial ties with new foreign countries. These desires were given free rein under the Zhengde Emperor, who was intrigued with <b>and</b> <b>desired</b> to learn about foreign and exotic peoples. However, with his death, eunuch influence at court was challenged by Yang Tinghe, who announced the rejection of the Portuguese embassy under Pires and Andrade the day after the emperor's death; the embassy was forced to leave and arrived back in Canton in September.|$|E

40|$|The {{psychological}} {{experience of}} the sexual response cycle has, in recent years, been theoretically redefined {{to take into account}} the multidimensional nature of its different stages and the important biopsychosocial factors that influence them. The first chapter of this thesis advocates a four-dimensional model to describe the subjective experience of sexual arousal <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> in both men and women, with three positive dimensions including an evaluative, a motivational, and a physiological factor, as well as a fourth aversive or inhibitive negative factor. An adjective-rating questionnaire, called the Sexual Arousal <b>and</b> <b>Desire</b> Inventory (SADI), was developed to evaluate this multidimensional model of sexual arousal <b>and</b> <b>desire.</b> A sample of 195 women and 195 men completed the questionnaire to convey their subjective experiences of sexual arousal <b>and</b> <b>desire.</b> Results supported the four-factor model to describe men and women's experiences of sexual arousal <b>and</b> <b>desire,</b> suggesting they involve similar experiences. Further inquiry into the questionnaire's psychometric properties as a measure of subjective sexual arousal <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> <b>and</b> of the four-dimensional model revealed excellent reliability and validity, and is covered in chapter one as well. Chapter two examines whether the presence or absence of specific sexual cues, including the ejaculation ending and the soundtrack of an erotic film segment, would alter the subjective experience of sexual arousal <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> of men <b>and</b> women. The third and final chapter of this thesis introduces a Quebec French translation of the SADI. In a preliminary study, 310 women and 59 men completed the questionnaire. Results supported the four-factor model in this French version of the SADI and suggested that this model is adequate to describe the subjective experience of sexual arousal <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> of Quebec Francophone populations. A more equal sample of men and women will need to be evaluated in order to confirm the validity of these results in both sexes...|$|R
