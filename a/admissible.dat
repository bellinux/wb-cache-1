5|$|Ultimately, {{the court}} found that the admissions were not given voluntarily, and so were not <b>admissible.</b>|$|E
5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights that must be given by law enforcement before interrogation. It stems from the 1966 Miranda v. Arizona case, and is based primarily on the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If a defendant in custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be <b>admissible</b> in court. If a defendant is not in police custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights, and their statements may still be <b>admissible.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Segura v. United States, the Court {{ruled that}} {{evidence}} illegally found without {{a search warrant}} is <b>admissible</b> if the evidence is later found and legally seized based on information independent of the illegal search.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{concluded}} that the conflict of interest materialized in a few ways. First, Stewart declined to cross-examine one of the witnesses, who could implicate Kretske but not Glasser, for fear that it would strengthen the case against Kretske. Stewart also failed to object to the testimony of other witnesses regarding prior statements of Kretske; under the rules of hearsay, these statements were obviously <b>admissible</b> against Kretske, but less obviously <b>admissible</b> against Glasser without a predicate showing that Glasser was a co-conspirator. Stewart feared that an objection only on behalf of Glasser would highlight the admissibility of the statements against Kretske.|$|E
5|$|Taw {{appealed to}} the High Court against his {{conviction}} on two main grounds. The first involved the admissibility of evidence for his corruption, and, additionally, inconsistencies of such evidence. The second concerned constitutional issues. With regard to the evidential issue, the Court held that the trial judge made an error in accepting GIC's statements as <b>admissible,</b> and thus ordered Taw's convictions to be set aside.|$|E
5|$|Ability {{of judges}} to balance {{competing}} policy considerations. Where the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, judges may be ill-equipped to decide {{because of their}} limited training, experience and access to materials. Thus, the courts should avoid reviewing the merits of such executive decisions. This was mentioned in GCHQ where Lord Diplock held {{that the type of}} evidence <b>admissible</b> in the judicial process {{and the way in which}} it is adduced tends to exclude from the attention of the court competing policy considerations which need to be weighed against one another.|$|E
5|$|Anderson and Ward {{devise a}} plan to indict members of the Klan for the murders. They arrange a {{kidnapping}} of Mayor Tilman, taking him to a remote shack. There, he is left with a black man, who threatens to castrate him unless he talks. The abductor is an FBI operative assigned to intimidate Tilman, who gives him a full description of the killings, including {{the names of those}} involved. Although his statement is not <b>admissible</b> in court due to coercion, Tilman's information proves valuable to the investigators.|$|E
5|$|Angle {{was arrested}} on September 4, 2011, by Virginia State Troopers for {{allegedly}} driving under the influence. Angle was placed in Warren County Jail, before posting $2,000 bail and being released in the early morning. State police revealed that Angle's initial breath test at the scene, where he was stopped by police, showed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.091 percent, which was above the legal limit of 0.08 percent. The test was later ruled not <b>admissible</b> and when a second test, taken at the police station, showed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.06, the DUI charge was dropped. Angle was still charged with reckless driving. On November 8, 2011, Angle entered a plea of no contest and was fined $1,500.|$|E
5|$|As drive-through {{penalties}} are not <b>admissible</b> for appeal, McLaren's lawyer Mark Phillips QC {{attempted to}} convince the court that since the penalty was {{in the form of}} time added on, the case was valid. They presented the previous case of Vitantonio Liuzzi at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix, specifically the FIA's claim that the presiding chief steward at the race, Tony Scott Andrews, had admitted fault in awarding the penalty to Liuzzi. Andrews denied the FIA's allegation. McLaren went on to use the case as a precedent for the Spa incident. The Court stated that this analogy was invalid, since in Liuzzi's case the admissibility of his appeal was not contested.|$|E
5|$|Once it {{has been}} decided that the gift has failed, the courts {{consider}} whether the gift may be applied cy-près. The gift must show charitable intention; that the settlor intended not just a gift to a particular (failed) purpose or organisation, but a more general charitable intention. This is something decided on the facts of each individual case, but some general principles are in place; external evidence is <b>admissible</b> to override any prima facie interpretation that a gift is for non-charitable purposes, as in Re Satterthwaite's Will Trusts, and charitable intention {{can be found in}} cases where a non-existent charity is the recipient of the settlor's gift, as in Re Harwood.|$|E
5|$|Drivers are {{not legally}} {{required}} to take field sobriety tests, although the results are <b>admissible</b> in court. The Alcotest has replaced the Breathalyzer as the standard device for determining blood alcohol level. When a driver is arrested for DUI, the police are prohibited from using force to obtain a breath, blood, or urine sample, and must warn {{the driver of the}} consequences of refusing a breath sample. In 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the breath sample refusal conviction of a non-English speaking driver, ruling that drivers must be notified of the law in a language that they understand. A person can be charged with DUI or breath refusal up to 90 days after the incident, except in cases of serious injury or death, in which case the statute of limitations is 5 years.|$|E
5|$|The Baltimore Sun runs {{a front-page}} story accusing the {{homicide}} unit of fumbling the investigation and protecting the Wilsons based on their race. Under pressure form his superiors, Gee demands they solve the murder immediately. Pembleton admits privately to his wife Mary (Ami Brabson) that he let his personal feelings of respect for Felix Wilson {{get in the way}} of the investigation; he agrees to make them a central part of the investigation. After searching the Wilson house, the detectives find love letters written by Hal Wilson to Brierre. Pembleton questions Felix and Hal, who agree to talk only if their statements are not <b>admissible</b> in court. Pembleton confronts the Wilsons with the love letters, which Hal said he never had the courage to give to Brierre. Felix said he would not have had sex with Brierre if he had known, which Hal said he does not believe. Felix demands the truth from Hal, who admits to killing Brierre in a jealous rage upon learning of her affair with his father.|$|E
25|$|Every <b>admissible</b> monomorphism is the {{kernel of}} its {{corresponding}} <b>admissible</b> epimorphism, and vice versa: {{this is true}} as morphisms in A, and E is a full subcategory.|$|E
25|$|Admissibility: Future cashflows {{may not get}} {{full credit}} in a company's {{accounts}} (life insurance companies, for example, may not always get full credit for future surpluses in their regulatory balance sheet), and a securitization effectively turns an <b>admissible</b> future surplus flow into an <b>admissible</b> immediate cash asset.|$|E
25|$|To be <b>admissible,</b> the {{evidence}} {{referred to in}} the document must itself be <b>admissible.</b> The person supplying the information must have had personal knowledge of it (or be reasonably supposed to have had), and everyone else through whom the information was supplied must have also been acting in the course of business.|$|E
25|$|The {{admissibility}} of {{an intervention}} {{is subject to}} conditions. The so-called notice of intervention must notably be filed within {{three months of the}} date on which proceedings referred to in Article 105 are instituted. An <b>admissible</b> intervention is treated as an opposition. If the intervention is <b>admissible,</b> the intervener becomes party to the opposition proceedings.|$|E
25|$|Evidence law {{involves}} which {{materials are}} <b>admissible</b> in courts for {{a case to}} be built.|$|E
25|$|In the sequent calculus, {{the rule}} of cut is <b>admissible.</b> This result is also {{referred}} to as Gentzen's Hauptsatz ("Main Theorem").|$|E
25|$|A* uses an <b>admissible</b> heuristic. Otherwise, A* is not {{guaranteed}} to expand fewer nodes than another search algorithm {{with the same}} heuristic.|$|E
25|$|Suppose {{now that}} some other search {{algorithm}} B terminates its search with a path whose actual cost {{is not less than}} the estimated cost of a path through some open node. Based on the heuristic information it has, Algorithm B cannot {{rule out the possibility that}} a path through that node has a lower cost. So while B might consider fewer nodes than A*, it cannot be <b>admissible.</b> Accordingly, A* considers the fewest nodes of any <b>admissible</b> search algorithm.|$|E
25|$|We {{came down}} here to offer {{evidence}} in this case and the court has held under the law that the evidence we had is not <b>admissible,</b> so {{all we can do is}} to take an exception and carry it to a higher court to see whether the evidence is <b>admissible</b> or not...we cannot even explain to you that we think you should return a verdict of not guilty. We do not see how you could. We do not ask it.|$|E
25|$|It turns out, however, {{that the}} positive-part {{estimator}} is also inadmissible. This follows from a general result which requires <b>admissible</b> estimators to be smooth.|$|E
25|$|In physics, the {{principle}} of relativity is the requirement that the equations describing {{the laws of physics}} have the same form in all <b>admissible</b> frames of reference.|$|E
25|$|Admissibility: The {{invocation}} of every operation is <b>admissible</b> in its execution state, i.e., every invocation must not violate any effects relation (object ordering) {{that has been}} established by earlier invocations.|$|E
25|$|After pushing doses to the morally <b>admissible</b> limit without {{producing}} visuals, Turner and Merlis conservatively concluded: “We must reject bufotenine…as {{capable of}} producing the acute phase of Cohoba intoxication”.|$|E
25|$|One major {{misconception}} {{about the}} hearsay {{rule is that}} hearsay is never <b>admissible</b> in court. While the general rule is that such evidence is inadmissible, there are many exceptions.|$|E
25|$|Evidence unlawfully {{obtained}} from the defendant by a private person is <b>admissible.</b> The exclusionary rule is designed to protect privacy rights, with the Fourth Amendment applying specifically to government officials.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{criteria}} that the Committee can consider in order to determine whether the complaint is <b>admissible</b> or not. The Committee can consider one or all of these criteria, it is entirely discretionary.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{held that}} {{testimony}} {{on the form}} of a victim impact statement was <b>admissible</b> and constitutional in death penalty cases, thus expressly overruling two prior cases, Booth v. Maryland (1987) and South Carolina v. Gathers (1989).|$|E
25|$|However, the Washington Supreme Court {{reinstated}} the conviction, {{ruling that}} the witness's statement was reliable under Roberts. In particular, the court noted that Michael and Sylvia Crawford's statements interlocked, and therefore concluded that Sylvia’s statements were <b>admissible.</b>|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, even in common-law systems, the {{hearsay rule}} only applies to actual trials. Hearsay is <b>admissible</b> as {{evidence}} {{in many other}} judicial proceedings, such as grand jury deliberations, probation hearings, parole revocation hearings, and proceedings before administrative bodies.|$|E
25|$|A {{numbering}} is an enumeration of functions; {{it has two}} parameters, e and x and outputs {{the value}} of the e-th function in the numbering on the input x. Numberings can be partial-recursive although some of its members are total recursive, that is, computable functions. <b>Admissible</b> numberings are those into which all others can be translated. A Friedberg numbering (named after its discoverer) is a one-one numbering of all partial-recursive functions; it is necessarily not an <b>admissible</b> numbering. Later research dealt also with numberings of other classes like classes of recursively enumerable sets. Goncharov discovered for example a class of recursively enumerable sets for which the numberings fall into exactly two classes with respect to recursive isomorphisms.|$|E
25|$|The granny knot is tricolorable. In this {{coloring}} {{the three}} strands at every crossing have three different colors. Coloring one but not {{both of the}} trefoil knots all red would also give an <b>admissible</b> coloring. The true lover's knot is also tricolorable.|$|E
25|$|Admission of guilt: if a {{declarant}} makes a statement, {{verbal or}} otherwise, as {{an admission of}} guilt of the matter at hand, that statement is <b>admissible.</b> Unlike other cases of declarations against interest, the declarant in this situation need not be unavailable.|$|E
25|$|Business records exception: {{business}} records created during the {{ordinary course of business}} are considered reliable and {{can usually be}} brought in under this exception if the proper foundation is laid when the records are introduced into evidence. Depending on which jurisdiction the case is in, either the records custodian or someone with knowledge of the records must lay a foundation for the records, however. The use of police records, especially as substantive evidence against the accused in a criminal trial, is severely restricted under the Business Records exception. Typically, only generalized evidence about police procedure is <b>admissible</b> under this exception, and not facts about a specific case. For example, John is stopped for speeding 70 miles per hour in a 50-mile-per-hour zone. The officer, who determined John's speed with radar, records the speed in an incident report. He also calibrates and runs a diagnostic on his radar every day prior to beginning his shift. He records this in a log. At trial, the report itself would not be <b>admissible</b> as it pertained to the facts of the case. However, the officer's daily log in which he records his calibration and the daily diagnostics of his radar unit would be <b>admissible</b> under the {{business records}} exception.|$|E
25|$|Whether all {{available}} domestic remedies have been exhausted. If {{it would be}} impractical or unreasonable for these to be exhausted; if, for example, there {{would be too much}} of a delay or legal aid was not available, then the Committee can make an exception and allow the complaint to be <b>admissible.</b>|$|E
