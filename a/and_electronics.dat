5|$|The GCV {{was to be}} {{operable}} {{with the}} current battle command control and communications suite but would gradually use a more state-of-the-art networked integration system known as the BCT Network. It would provide exportable electrical power, and a battery charging capability for external hardware including vehicles <b>and</b> <b>electronics</b> from the BCT Soldier subsystems. The system {{would be capable of}} integration with unmanned systems and dismounted soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{components}} in an electric circuit {{can take many}} forms, which can include elements such as resistors, capacitors, switches, transformers <b>and</b> <b>electronics.</b> Electronic circuits contain active components, usually semiconductors, and typically exhibit non-linear behaviour, requiring complex analysis. The simplest electric components {{are those that are}} termed passive and linear: while they may temporarily store energy, they contain no sources of it, and exhibit linear responses to stimuli.|$|E
5|$|While {{designing}} the Creighton-Ward Mansion sets, Bell {{and his staff}} strove for authenticity, ordering miniature Tudor paintings, -scale Georgian- and Regency-style furniture and carpeting {{in the shape of}} a polar bear skin. This realism was enhanced by adding scrap items acquired from household waste <b>and</b> <b>electronics</b> shops. For example, a vacuum cleaner pipe serves as Virgil Tracy's launch chute.|$|E

5|$|Electronics {{deals with}} {{electrical}} circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, optoelectronics, sensors and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies. The nonlinear behaviour of active components {{and their ability}} to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible <b>and</b> <b>electronics</b> is widely used in information processing, telecommunications, and signal processing. The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information processing possible. Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working system.|$|E
5|$|Exports formed 28percent of GDP in 2009. Most of the country's {{export revenue}} {{is derived from}} the {{textiles}} industry, fish and shellfish, vanilla, cloves and other foodstuffs. France is Madagascar's main trading partner, although the United States, Japan and Germany also have strong economic ties to the country. The Madagascar-U.S. Business Council was formed in May 2003, as a collaboration between USAID and Malagasy artisan producers to support the export of local handicrafts to foreign markets. Imports of such items as foodstuffs, fuel, capital goods, vehicles, consumer goods <b>and</b> <b>electronics</b> consume an estimated 52percent of GDP. The main sources of Madagascar's imports include China, France, Iran, Mauritius and Hong Kong.|$|E
