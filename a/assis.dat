The return of the Conservatives resulted in Inhaúma's election to the Chamber of Deputies as a representative for the province of Amazonas, although he would never assume office. In the new political climate, Inhaúma was also considered a contender for a senatorial chair representing the province of Rio de Janeiro.|$|E

5|$|By the 1880s Romanticism was {{superseded}} by new literary styles. The first to appear was Realism, which had among its most notable writers Joaquim Maria Machado de <b>Assis</b> and Raul Pompeia. Newer styles that coexisted with Realism, Naturalism and Parnassianism, were both {{connected to the}} former's evolution. Among the best-known Naturalists were Aluísio Azevedo and Adolfo Caminha. Notable Parnassians were Gonçalves Crespo, Alberto de Oliveira, Raimundo Correia and Olavo Bilac. Brazilian theater became influenced by Realism in 1855, decades earlier than the style's impact upon literature and poetry. Famous Realist playwrights included José de Alencar, Quintino Bocaiuva, Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, Júlia Lopes de Almeida and Maria Angélica Ribeiro. Brazilian plays staged by national companies competed for audiences alongside foreign plays and companies. Performing arts in Imperial Brazil also encompassed the staging of musical duets, dancing, gymnastics, comedy and farces. Less prestigious, but more popular with the working classes were puppeteers and magicians, {{as well as the}} circus, with its travelling companies of performers, including acrobats, trained animals, illusionists and other stunt-oriented artists.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to make a}} {{comparison}} between Machado de <b>Assis’s</b> narrative procedures in the chronicle O punhal de Martinha and Denis Diderot’s procedure in Le neveu de Rameau, based on the analysis of these pieces of work made by Roberto Schwartz and Vladimir Safatle, respectively. In the chronicle, Machado de <b>Assis’s</b> narrator varies the tune among the proud citizen of 19 th century, well informed about what happens in the big cities of the civilized world, and the nationalist writer, all worried about his peripheral situation as a Brazilian writer in that century. This narrator inverts and plays with the ideas of local and universal by comparing two knives: the notable one, related to the history of the roman Lucretia; and the unsuspected one, related to Martinha, an unknown Brazilian woman. In his turn, Diderot puts on scene in his novel the dialogue between the enlightened philosopher and Rameau’s nephew, a completely amoral person, who is able to equally argue with the first and even disestablish his point of view. By doing this, Diderot shows the impossibility of effectiveness of the Enlightenment’s expectations since its beginning. In both cases cynicism is what covers up the harsh criticism on the impossibility of making concrete the Enlightenment ideals, thought to be universal...|$|R

40|$|Machado de <b>Assis’s</b> {{invention}} of the dead author informs the plot weaving not only of The Posthumous Memories of Bras Cubas, but also of Dom Casmurro. Both novels reveal themselves to be posthumous memoires. In the recollection of times gone by the narrator adopts a dual perspective, in which two narrative visions intertwine, the one belonging to the dead author who is ironically distanced from the events, {{the other to the}} protagonist emotionally involved with the events. This double narrative mediation is made evident through a comparison with fictional experiments such as Dickens’s David Copperfield and Thackeray’s Henry Esmond. Dom Casmurro’s peculiarity is notable in its shift between internal and external perspective and in its adoption of a multiperspectivism that enables the narrator to take up multiple fictional masks. We demonstrate that the overisight of the narrative multiperspectivism impoverishes the critical reception of the novel, which has predominantly dealt with Capitu’s supposed adultery. After a brief revision of the critical fortune of Dom Casmurro, the essay proposes the theory of the opera as a structural matrix of the novel and highlights the technique of the reversed illusion as key to the transformation of an apparently tragic plot into a tragicomic drama...|$|R

5000|$|Critics {{are divided}} {{as to the}} nature of Machado de <b>Assis's</b> writing. Some, such as Abel Barros Baptista, {{classify}} Machado as a staunch anti-realist, and argue that his writing attacks Realism, aiming to negate the possibility of representation or the existence of a meaningful objective reality. Realist critics such as John Gledson are more likely to regard Machado's work as a faithful description of Brazilian reality—but one executed with daring innovative technique. In light of Machado's own statements, Daniel argues that Machado's novels represent a growing sophistication and daring in maintaining a dialogue between the aesthetic subjectivism of Romanticism (and its offshoots) and the aesthetic objectivism of Realism-Naturalism. Accordingly, Machado's earlier novels {{have more in common with}} a hybrid mid-19th-century current often referred to as [...] "Romantic Realism." [...] In addition, his later novels have more in common with another late 19th-century hybrid: literary Impressionism. Historians such as Sidney Chalhoub argue that Machado's prose constitutes an exposé of the social, political and economic dysfunction of Second Empire Brazil. Critics agree on how he used innovative techniques to reveal the contradictions of his society. Roberto Schwarz points out that Machado's innovations in prose narrative are used to expose the hypocrisies, contradictions, and dysfunction of 19th-century Brazil. Schwarz, argues that Machado inverts many narrative and intellectual conventions to reveal the pernicious ends to which they are used. Thus we see critics reinterpret Machado according to their own designs or their perception of how best to validate him for their own historical moment. Regardless, his incisive prose shines through, able to communicate with readers from different times and places, conveying his ironic and yet tender sense of what we, as human beings, are.|$|R
