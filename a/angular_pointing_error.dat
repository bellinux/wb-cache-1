40|$|Previous {{research}} has found performance for several egocentric tasks to be superior on physically large displays relative to smaller ones, even when visual angle is held constant. This finding {{is believed to be}} due to the more immersive nature of large displays. In our experiment, we examined if using a large display to learn a virtual environment (VE) would improve egocentric knowledge of the target locations. Participants learned the location of five targets by freely exploring a desktop large-scale VE of a city on either a small (25 ” diagonally) or large (72 ” diagonally) screen. Viewing distance was adjusted so that both displays subtended the same viewing angle. Knowledge of the environment was then assessed using a head-mounted display in virtual reality, by asking participants to stand at each target and point at the other unseen targets. <b>Angular</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>error</b> was significantly lower when the environment was learned on a 72 ” display. Our results suggest that large displays are superior for learning a virtual environment and the advantages of learning an environment on a large display may transfer to navigation in the real world...|$|E
40|$|We are {{investigating}} the nature and quality of mental spatial representations by studying spatial behaviour in real and virtual environments. Last year we presented data on bearing estimations in a real environment. New bearing data obtained in a corresponding virtual environment have allowed us to study knowledge transfer between real and virtual environments. From each of eleven familiar locations in the centre of Tübingen, subjects had to estimate {{the direction of the}} ten other occluded locations. Whereas the subjects in the outdoor experiment had walked to each subsequent location, in the laboratory the same ten subjects were seated in front of a half-cylindrical projection screen (7 m diameter). On this screen, 180 deg × 50 deg segments of panoramic photographs taken at each location were displayed. Pointing in this virtual environment was accomplished by rotating the projected image until the estimated direction matched that of a demarcation line on the projection screen. The mean absolute <b>angular</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>error</b> was 11. 0 ± 0. 3 ° in the real environment (RE) and 12. 9 ± 0. 4 ° in the virtual environment (VE). Mean signed pointing error (a measure for the systematic deviation) varied strongly between places, but was generally smaller when pointing to a place (RE: - 10 ° [...] . 13 °; VE: - 10 ° [...] . 14 °) than when pointing from a place (RE: - 4 ° [...] . 4 °; VE: - 5 ° [...] . 5 °). The pattern of systematic errors was very similar in both environments and was stable over repetitions of the experiment. We conclude that: (i) the cognitive maps that underlie our subjects' pointing behaviour were close to the real map but not identical to it; (ii) subjects' pointing behaviour in the laboratory setting was nearly identical to that in the real world, suggesting an effortless transfer of knowledge obtained in the RE to the VE...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} bias (constant error) in spatial memory {{in an effort}} to determine whether this bias is defined by a dynamic egocentric reference frame that moves with the observer or by an environmentally fixed reference frame. Participants learned the locations of six target objects around them in a room, were blindfolded, and then rotated themselves to face particular response headings. From each response heading, participants used a pointer to indicate the remembered azimuthal locations of the objects. Analyses of the <b>angular</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>errors</b> showed a previously observed pattern of bias. More importantly, it appeared that this pattern of bias was defined relative to and moved with the observer-that is, was egocentric and dynamic.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develope analytical solutions for the translational and rotational motion of a spinning rigid body when it is subjected to constant body-fixed forces and constant moments. We consider two cases in this thesis: (1) when we have three body-fixed forces along all three axes and two body-fixed moments along two transverse axes, and (2) when we have three body-fixed forces and three body-fixed moments along all three axes. Among the aerospace applications of these analytical theories are the thrusting, spinning spacecraft problem and the thrusting, spinning-up (or spinning-down) spacecraft problem. We consider a single spinning rigid body with constant mass properties and constant body-fixed forces and moments. Also, we assume that two Eulerian angles are small and the spin axis is the z axis which may be either the maximum or minimum moment-of-inertia axis. The results of this theory are valid for axisymmetric, nearly-axisymmetric and under some circumstances, asymmetric rigid bodies. ^ We use the analytical solutions to develope an asymptotic theory for the two aforementioned cases. Considering secular terms and finding asymptotic limits in the complete analytical solutions give insight into the behaviour of the motion. Identifying periodic and secular terms or determining the asymptotic limits (arising from a complete but complicated analytical theory) lead to simple closed-form practical solutions. Also, considering the geometrically limiting cases of a sphere, a thin rod, and a flat disk can drastically reduce the number of terms in the full-blown theory. The distillation of such simplified expressions can give the practical engineer a handle in understanding the essential motion—a back-of-the envelope calculation, a sanity check. We find asymptotic limits for angular velocities, Eulerian angles, velocity bias angle, <b>angular</b> momentum <b>pointing</b> <b>error,</b> transverse and axial velocities, and transverse and axial displacements. ...|$|R

The first part of the analysis contains a preliminary study whose results conclude on the need of a sun movement correction for the correct evaluation of the <b>pointing</b> <b>error</b> from both new measurements. Once this correction is applied, both measurements show an equivalent behavior with differences under 0. 01 ° in the evaluation of the <b>pointing</b> <b>error.</b> The second part of the analysis includes the incorporation of the cross scenario in the AERONET routine measurement protocol in order to monitor the <b>pointing</b> <b>error</b> in field instruments.

Visual localization thresholds (an error measure) rise systematically with eccentricity, doubling at eccentricities of a degree or less. Previous work, which we confirmed, {{has shown that the}} precision of pointing, measured by the standard deviation, to a single isolated target is relatively constant over small lateral extents near the midline, and that <b>pointing</b> <b>error</b> is substantially larger than visual error. We used target uncertainty (randomly chosen locations) to greatly increase visual noise so that we could explore the influence of visual noise on <b>pointing</b> <b>error.</b> We compared precision for comparable visual and pointing tasks as a function of target eccentricity.
