25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 203 species of fish inhabit the Oyster Harbour, Princess Royal Harbour and King George Sound, with Australian pilchards Sardinops sagax neopilchardus making up 97% of the total fish catch. Other species that are commonly found include Australian herring, leatherjackets, cobbler, King George whiting, tailor, Australian anchovy, garfish, sand trevally, tarwhine, flathead, tuna, snapper, <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon,</b> yellowtail scad, sea mullet, striped trumpeter, long-toothed flounder, dusky morwong and long-finned goby.|$|E
500|$|The {{copper shark}} feeds more towards {{the bottom of}} the water column than the top, {{consuming}} cephalopods, including squid (Loligo spp.), cuttlefishes, and octopus; bony fishes, including gurnards, flatfishes, hakes, catfishes, jacks, <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon,</b> mullets, sea breams, smelts, tunas, sardines, and anchovies; and cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish sharks (Squalus spp.), stingrays, skates, electric rays, and sawfishes. Cephalopods and cartilaginous fishes become relatively more important food for sharks over [...] long. Young sharks also consume scyphozoan jellyfish and crustaceans, including mud shrimps (Callianassa) and penaeid prawns. It does not attack marine mammals, though has been known rarely to scavenge on dolphins that had succumbed to fishing nets. The predominant prey of this species off South Africa is the southern African pilchard (Sardinops sagax), which comprise 69–95% of its diet. Every winter, schools of copper sharks follow the [...] "run" [...] of the pilchard from the Eastern Cape to KwaZulu-Natal. The gathering of millions of forage fish attract a multitude of predators, including several species of sharks, of which copper sharks are the most numerous.|$|E
40|$|Variation {{within the}} major {{histocompatibility}} (MH) class II alpha gene (Sasa-DAA) was compared between domesticated <b>Australian</b> Atlantic <b>salmon</b> and their ancestral Canadian population. The level of Sasa-DAA and MH class II beta gene (Sasa-DAB) sequence variation was also examined within the Australian population and {{compared with that}} published for European Atlantic salmon populations. In contrast to variation previously reported for noncoding microsatellite loci, {{a high level of}} MH class II allelic variation has been maintained within the domesticated Australian populations. Furthermore, a high level of Sasa-DAA and Sasa-DAB allele sequence diversity was also observed and exceeded that reported for other cultured Atlantic salmon populations. The number of Sasa-DAB allele sequences (14) surpassed the number of Sasa-DAA allele sequences (9) to produce 14 unique class II haplotypes. We conclude that the <b>Australian</b> Atlantic <b>salmon</b> populations show high MH class II allelic and haplotypic variation compared with both its ancestral Canadian population and other cultured Atlantic salmon populations...|$|R

40|$|Amoebic {{gill disease}} (AGD) {{is the most}} {{significant}} health issue affecting the culture of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in Tasmania, Australia. Recent research has suggested that heritable variation in AGD resistance exists within the Tasmanian Atlantic salmon population. Subsequently, enhancing this resistance through selective breeding has become a major research focus in Tasmania. The mechanisms controlling this commercially important trait remain poorly understood. To this end, an investigation of the molecular mechanisms controlling AGD resistance was conducted. Due to their high polymorphism and important immune function genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) - known as the MH genes in Atlantic salmon - represent some of the best candidate loci with a possible influence upon AGD resistance. With this in mind, the amount of MH variation and its association with resistance to AGD was investigated. In contrast to what has been previously reported at non-coding microsatellite loci, a high level of MH class II diversity has been maintained in the <b>Australian</b> Atlantic <b>salmon</b> population compared to the ancestral population. The use of an AGD challenge test with subsequent MH genotyping demonstrated that the presence of one MH class II alpha allele known as Sasa-DAA- 3 UTR 239 was significantly associated with reduced disease severity. Individuals containing a copy of this allele had 4. 0...|$|R

50|$|Arripis is a genus {{of marine}} fishes from Australia and New Zealand, known as <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon,</b> kahawai and Australian herring. They {{are the only}} {{members of the family}} Arripidae. Despite the common name, <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon</b> are not related to the salmon family Salmonidae of the Northern Hemisphere, just as Australian herring are not related to herring of the Northern Hemisphere, but belong to the order Perciformes of perch-like fishes. <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon</b> were named so by early European {{settlers}} after their superficial resemblance to the salmoniform fishes.|$|E
50|$|In New Zealand, <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon</b> and in {{particular}} northern kahawai are highly regarded for their flesh when hot smoked by recreational fisherman, usually using manuka sawdust or woodchips. <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon</b> prepared in this manner are available in many New Zealand supermarkets and fishmongers. The flesh is usually eaten hot, or broken up and used in fish pie.|$|E
5000|$|Although their {{reproduction}} is poorly studied, <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon</b> are all {{known to be}} [...] "pelagic spawners"; that is, they spawn in open water during the austral spring, releasing {{a large number of}} tiny (1 mm in diameter), smooth spherical eggs made buoyant by lipid droplets. The eggs (and later the larvae), which possess an unsegmented yolk, become part of the zooplankton, drifting {{at the mercy of the}} currents until the larvae develop and settle. The young <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon</b> then spend the first two to five years in sheltered coastal bays, inlets, and estuaries until they become sexually mature and begin to move into more open waters. Relatively long-lived fishes, <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon</b> may attain an age of 26 yr in Arripis trutta and 7-9 yr in other species.|$|E

50|$|The lake is fished commercially for short-finned eel. It also usually {{contains}} yellow-eye mullet, {{black bream}} and <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon.</b> Other fish may be present, depending on salinity levels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Australian</b> <b>salmon</b> form immense {{schools with}} {{hundreds}} {{to thousands of}} individuals, as both adults and juveniles. They are carnivorous and feed primarily on small fish, such as pilchard (Clupeidae); crustaceans such as krill (Euphausiacea), copepods, and other zooplankton (the latter comprising {{the bulk of the}} juvenile diets). The zoobenthos is also sampled to some extent, with primarily shellfish, crabs, and annelid worms eaten. The <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon</b> are very fast swimmers, and are sometimes seen mingling with ostensibly similar species of carangids, such as trevally; {{this is an example of}} mutualism.|$|E
50|$|Relatively {{long-lived}} fish, <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon</b> are a favoured {{target of}} recreational fishers, and both commercial and traditional Māori fisheries. They are also common bycatch of the Australasian snapper (Pagrus auratus), mullet (Mugilidae), white trevally (Pseudocaranx dentex), and mackerel (Scombridae) fisheries. These species are all taken {{in great numbers}} by way of purse seine nets and trawling. They are also caught by skilled fishermen along the southern coastline of Australia by beach seining. Due to declining numbers and ever-increasing annual catch sizes, the future viability of the <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon</b> stock has been put into question.|$|E
50|$|Pungently flavoured, coarse, and {{slightly}} oily flesh makes <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon</b> less desirable {{as a food}} fish; it is often sold canned or is smoked to improve its flavour, and bleeding the fish out is also said to help. What is not sold for human consumption is used as bait for rock lobster (Palinuridae) traps and other commercial and recreational fishing. The <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon</b> fetch {{no more than a}} few dollars (AU) per kilogram; nonetheless, large numbers are taken via purse seine nets (and to a lesser extent trawling, hauling, gill, and trap nets) annually; the reported 2002-2003 commercial New Zealand catch of kahawai was 2,900 tonnes. Such reported catches do not include the untold tonnes taken as bycatch from operations targeting more highly valued species. Low-flying planes are used to locate and target sizeable <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon</b> schools, and critics have cited this practice as a means by the industry to artificially inflate catch records (which would give a false impression of abundance). <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon</b> numbers have declined noticeably however, with large specimens becoming ever rarer; the fish have all but disappeared from some areas. On October 1, 2004, the New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries included kahawai under its Quota Management System, setting a catch limit of 3,035 tonnes for the season. This was a 5% increase over the previous two years, despite the government's intention of lowering catch limits.|$|E
50|$|Commercial fishing {{practices}} undertaken across Australia and New Zealand have been highly criticised in various recreational fishing magazines as being excessive. Many high-profile anglers, {{such as those}} on Fishing WA, have made statements that the commercial fish catch in Western Australia and Australia in general {{is beyond the scope}} necessary for human and animal consumption, and that they are far more valuable as a recreational fish species. The ease of catching <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon,</b> which tend to form schools of several tonnes, has meant recreational fishers are finding fewer of these species in inshore waters during the season (the migration patterns of <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon</b> mean they come into warmer waters during the autumn).|$|E
5000|$|Together {{with the}} carangids, <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon</b> feed en masse by co-operatively {{bullying}} baitfish {{up to the}} surface; this herding technique is exploited by seabirds which are quickly attracted to, and feed upon, the foaming mass of fish at the surface. This commensal relationship between the <b>Australian</b> <b>salmon</b> and the birds is noted to be especially strong in such species as the white-fronted tern, (Sterna striata), fluttering shearwater, (Puffinus gavia), and Buller's shearwater, (Puffinus bulleri). The baitfish made available by the Australian salmon's herding behaviour may also be important to the reproductive success of winter-nesting birds; {{the decline of the}} Australians salmon stocks has evoked concern for these bird species, some of which - such as the fairy tern, (Sterna nereis) - are endangered ...|$|E
