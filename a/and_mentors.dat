40|$|In {{discussion}} recently, a {{group of}} coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> students at Oxford Brookes University highlighted how studying coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring,</b> using rigorous methods to answer meaningful questions had developed their practice more than they could have ever anticipated. This issue of IJEBCM draws {{particular attention to the}} questions asked by those studying coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> illustrates the benefits to practice of undertaking meaningful and systematic research. The issue includes papers presented at the recent Coaching <b>and</b> <b>Mentoring</b> Research Conference, held at Oxford Brookes University on 7 th April 2006. Since research in the field of coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> is relatively new, this annual conference was instigated specifically to provide an opportunity for postgraduate students from any institution to share their work with a much wider audience. The benefits to coaching practice of well-formed questions are articulated in the summary by P. Alex Linley of his keynote presentation at the conference. In this paper Linley, writing as an academic researcher, talks about the advantages of research for coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> the obstacles to research both for the academic and the practitioner.

He was raised by one of her former ladies of the court, Urszula Meierin, who {{eventually}} became a powerful player at the royal court, with much influence. Władysław's Hofmeister was Michał Konarski, a Polish-Prussian noble. Around early 17th century Urszula lost much of her influence, as Władysław gained new teachers <b>and</b> <b>mentors,</b> such as priests Gabriel Prowancjusz, Andrzej Szołdrski and Marek Łętkowski, and in the military matters, Zygmunt Kazanowski. Much of his curriculum was likely designed by priest Piotr Skarga, much respected by Sigmismund III. Władysław studied for several years in the Kraków Academy, and for two years, in Rome.|$|E

40|$|This paper, {{adopts a}} case study {{approach}} {{in order to examine}} the issues relating to the deployment of a coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> intervention {{within the context of a}} specific UK based small and medium-sized enterprise (SME). The SME coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> research agenda is highlighted as an area urgently needing attention given its economic impact. This paper seeks to initiate this debate. The pre-eminence of culture within an organisational context is analysed in order to establish its uniqueness and impact on coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> deployment. A number of barriers to effective coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> within this context are also identified as issues that need to be incorporated within an intervention if it is to be successful. A coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> programme was developed to incorporate these findings and provide a starting point to address the SME research chasm...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{organizations}} have adopted coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> interventions {{to discover and}} foster the potential capabilities of employees. These practices are seen as competitive drivers to cultivate innovation and creativity in turbulent business environments. However, the literature has not investigated {{the question of how}} coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> are interrelated. By examining this connection, this study explores the joint effects of these practices on the organizational commitment of employees. The results from survey data of 247 employees, who were coachees as well as protégés at the same time, from 17 companies in South Korea suggested that mentoring moderates the positive relationship between managerial coaching and organizational commitment. In addition, the moderating effects also depended on the extent of the homogeneity of their coach <b>and</b> <b>mentor.</b> The positive relationship between managerial coaching and organizational commitment strongly increased with conditions of higher <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> lower homogeneity of coach <b>and</b> <b>mentor.</b> Conversely, the relationship became negative when both <b>mentoring</b> practice <b>and</b> the homogeneity of coach <b>and</b> <b>mentor</b> were low. These results could provide practical implications to organizations that are concurrently adopting both coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> programs by helping managers to better understand their joint effects...|$|R

40|$|Coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> {{have been}} studied {{extensively}} with specific regard to learning theories; however, {{there is a lack}} of coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> research that is both grounded in psychological theory and evidence-based in the real world. This paper suggests an innovative framework presenting two distinctive ‘research journeys’, namely, mentoring in informal education settings and coaching in formal education settings. The combined evidence reveals that coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> in supporting the learning and development of adolescents involves complex and subtle psychological, social, emotional, cognitive and contextual interactive processes for all participants. The paper proposes a unified psychological model of coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> for those involved in supporting the learning and development of adolescents and describes the dynamic processe...|$|R

40|$|Faculty Development <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> are {{critical}} issues for all universities.
