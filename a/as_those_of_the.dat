5|$|Motion, {{the process}} of movement, is {{described}} using specific anatomical terms. Motion includes movement of organs, joints, limbs, and specific sections of the body. The terminology used describes this motion according to its direction relative to the anatomical position of the joints. Anatomists use a unified set of terms to describe most of the movements, although other, more specialized terms are necessary for describing {{the uniqueness of the}} movements such <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hands, feet, and eyes.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1900, the {{similarity}} in {{shape of the}} shell of Amphidromus to that of South American tree snails in the family Bulimulidae had misled taxonomists. However, the dissections made by Wiegmann and Jacobi clearly showed that the inner anatomical features of Amphidromus were the same <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Asian-Indonesian Camaenidae, and that the resemblance of the shell of Amphidromus to that of bulimulids was merely an example of parallelism.|$|E

Berries, such <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kingore (certain Berberis spp.), are also eaten when available. Nestlings are fed mostly on insects, {{especially}} caterpillars and larval beetles obtained on trees and flying insects caught by aerial pursuit.

5|$|A larger demonstration, the 8N, {{took place}} two months later. It was {{attended}} by {{nearly half a million}} people. They protested a variety of issues such <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous demonstration, as well as the growing rate of inflation and the corruption scandals. Kirchner promised to keep her policies unchanged, and Senator Aníbal Fernández dismissed the significance of the demonstrations. Journalist Jorge Lanata explained the polarization was because the government and its supporters thought they were engaged in a revolution, and this justified being against freedom of the press and other public rights. Cabinet Chief Juan Manuel Abal Medina said the demonstrators belonged to a class that was against social justice, and compared the demonstrations to a coup d'état. A similar view was held by Kirchner's loyalists.|$|E
5|$|A {{mitochondrion}} contains DNA, {{which is}} organized as several {{copies of a}} single, usually circular, chromosome. This mitochondrial chromosome contains genes for redox proteins, such <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respiratory chain. The CoRR hypothesis proposes that this co-location is required for redox regulation. The mitochondrial genome codes for some RNAs of ribosomes, and the 22 tRNAs necessary for the translation of messenger RNAs into protein. The circular structure {{is also found in}} prokaryotes. The proto-mitochondrion was probably closely related to the Rickettsia. However, the exact relationship of the ancestor of mitochondria to the alphaproteobacteria and whether the mitochondrion was formed at the same time or after the nucleus, remains controversial.|$|E

These colours were purple over green, in a diamond shape, although a border of gray in an oval shape was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart; the oval shape designated the battalion as part of the 8th Division.|$|E
5|$|Although {{certain forms}} of dance were disapproved of at times as non-Roman or unmanly, dancing was {{embedded}} in religious rituals of archaic Rome, such <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dancing armed Salian priests and of the Arval Brothers, priesthoods which underwent a revival during the Principate. Ecstatic dancing was {{a feature of the}} international mystery religions, particularly the cult of Cybele as practised by her eunuch priests the Galli and of Isis.

5|$|As the Ottoman Empire {{proposed}} international mediation, Cuza {{took the}} initiative, and, on October 23, 1863, deposed the Kretzulescu cabinet, nominating instead his own selection of men: Kogălniceanu as Premier and Interior Minister, Dimitrie Bolintineanu as Minister of Religious Affairs. In {{order to prevent}} further international tensions, they decided to generalize confiscation to all Eastern Orthodox Church estates, Greek as well <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incipient Romanian Orthodox monasteries. The resolution was passed with 97 out of 100 parliamentary votes. Later, the Greek Church was presented with an offer of 150 million piasters as compensation, which was viewed as two low by its intended recipients, including Patriarch Sophoronius III. Consequently, the Romanian state considered the matter closed. As a direct consequence, {{one third of the}} arable land in Moldavia and a fourth of that in Wallachia were made available for a future land reform (one fifth to one fourth of the total arable land in the state as a whole).|$|E

The male engages in a soaring song flight in the mating season, but contributes little to nest building and incubation. Both sexes feed {{and care for the}} young. While the population appears to be decreasing, the black honeyeater is sufficiently numerous and widespread to be considered least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species.|$|E
5|$|Each town in {{the colony}} was {{considered}} a single church congregation; in later years, {{some of the larger}} towns split into two or three congregations. Church attendance was mandatory for all residents of the colony, while church membership was restricted to those who had converted to the faith. In Plymouth Colony, it seems that a simple profession of faith was all that was required for acceptance. This was a more liberal doctrine than some other New England congregations, such <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Massachusetts Bay Colony, where it was common to subject those seeking formal membership to strict and detailed cross-examinations. There was no central governing body for the churches. Each individual congregation was left to determine its own standards of membership, hire its own ministers, and conduct its own business.|$|E
