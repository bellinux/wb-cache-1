5|$|Siddiqui's first {{breakthrough}} in research {{came when he}} successfully isolated an <b>antiarrhythmic</b> agent in 1931 from the roots of Rauwolfia serpentina. He named the newly discovered chemical compound as Ajmaline, after his mentor Hakim Ajmal Khan {{who was one of}} the illustrious practitioners of Unani system of medicine in South Asia. Later on, Siddiqui also extracted other alkaloids from Rauwolfia serpentina that included Ajmalinine, Ajmalicine (C21H24N2O3), Isoajmaline, Neoajmaline, Serpentine and Serpentinine. Many of these are still used worldwide for treatment of mental disorders and cardiovascular ailments, especially as <b>antiarrhythmic</b> agents in Brugada syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Excessive {{production}} of the thyroid hormones is called hyperthyroidism, which is most commonly a result of Graves' disease, a toxic multinodular goitre, a solitary thyroid adenoma, or inflammation. Other causes include drug-induced excess of iodine, particularly from amiodarone, an <b>antiarrhythmic</b> medication; an excess caused by the preferential uptake of iodine by the thyroid following iodinated contrast imaging; or from pituitary adenomas which may cause an over{{production of}} thyroid stimulating hormone. Hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of non-specific symptoms including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, palpitations, anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause chest pain, diarrhoea, hair loss and muscle weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers.|$|E
5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} <b>antiarrhythmic</b> agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E
50|$|In the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), a large study {{testing the}} {{influence}} of <b>antiarrhythmics</b> on mortality, showed a statistically non-significant increase of mortality from 5.4 to 7.2% under moracizine.

5|$|Given that liver AVMs {{generally}} cause high-output cardiac failure, {{the emphasis}} is on treating this with diuretics to reduce the circulating blood volume, restriction of salt and fluid intake, and <b>antiarrhythmic</b> agents in case of irregular heart beat. This may be sufficient in treating the symptoms of swelling and breathlessness. If this treatment is not effective or leads to side effects or complications, the only remaining option is liver transplantation. This is reserved for those with severe symptoms, as it carries a mortality of about 10%, but leads to good results if successful. The exact point at which liver transplantion is to be offered is not yet completely established. Embolization treatment has been attempted, but leads to severe complications in a proportion of patients and is discouraged.|$|E

25|$|As a {{doctoral}} candidate at Oxford University, Bramah Singh determined that amiodarone and sotalol had <b>antiarrhythmic</b> properties and {{belonged to a}} new class of <b>antiarrhythmic</b> agents (what would become the class III <b>antiarrhythmic</b> agents). Today the mechanisms of action of amiodarone and sotalol have been investigated in more detail. Both drugs have been demonstrated to prolong the duration of the action potential, prolonging the refractory period, by interacting among other cellular function with K+ channels.|$|E
25|$|The <b>antiarrhythmic</b> drug {{lidocaine}} {{has been}} reported to be an effective treatment of aconitine poisoning of a patient.

25|$|<b>Antiarrhythmic</b> agents, {{also known}} as cardiac {{dysrhythmia}} medications, are a group of pharmaceuticals {{that are used to}} suppress abnormal rhythms of the heart (cardiac arrhythmias), such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation.|$|E
25|$|If {{a person}} with WPW {{experiences}} episodes of atrial fibrillation, the ECG shows a rapid polymorphic wide-complex tachycardia (without torsades de pointes).

50|$|Similar {{to local}} anesthetics and sodium channel {{blocking}} <b>antiarrhythmics,</b> labetalol also has membrane stabilizing activity. By decreasing sodium entry, labetalol decreases action potential firing and thus has local anesthetic activity.|$|R
25|$|Both propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene are potent {{blockers}} {{of cardiac}} membrane sodium channels {{and are more}} potent than lidocaine, quinidine, and procainamide in this respect.

25|$|Both enantiomers of {{propranolol}} have a local anesthetic (topical) effect, {{which is}} normally mediated by blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels.

25|$|Efficacy {{and risks}} of {{catheter}} ablation of AF are areas of active debate. A worldwide {{survey of the}} outcomes of 8745 ablation procedures demonstrated a 52% success rate (ranging from 14.5% to 76.5% among centers), with an additional 23.9% of patients becoming asymptomatic with addition of an <b>antiarrhythmic</b> medication. In 27.3% of patients, more than one procedure was required to attain these results. There {{was at least one}} major complication in 6% of patients. Death has been found to occur in 1 in 1000 people who undergo this procedure. A thorough discussion of results of catheter ablation was published in 2007; it notes that results are widely variable, due in part to differences in technique, follow-up, definitions of success, use of <b>antiarrhythmic</b> therapy, and in experience and technical proficiency.|$|E
50|$|L-type {{calcium channel}} blocker drugs are used as cardiac <b>antiarrhythmics</b> or antihypertensives, {{depending}} on whether the drugs have higher affinity for the heart (the phenylalkylamines, like verapamil), or for the vessels (the dihydropyridines, like nifedipine).|$|R

25|$|Whichever {{method of}} {{cardioversion}} is used, approximately 50% of patients relapse within one year, although the continued daily use of oral <b>antiarrhythmic</b> drugs may extend this period.

25|$|Amiodarone is an <b>antiarrhythmic</b> {{medication}} used {{to treat}} and prevent a number of types of irregular heartbeats. This includes ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and wide complex tachycardia, as well as atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. It can be given by mouth, intravenously, or intraosseously. When used by mouth, it can take a few weeks for effects to begin.|$|E
25|$|The AFFIRM {{study showed}} no {{difference}} in risk of stroke in patients who have converted to a normal rhythm with <b>antiarrhythmic</b> treatment, {{compared to those who}} have only rate control.
