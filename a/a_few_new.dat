5|$|The {{downloadable}} content The Warpath Campaign was criticised by Game Watcher for not integrating {{into the}} original campaign and for only adding <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>new</b> units.

5|$|After {{staying for}} a period in Robert's stronghold of Bristol, Matilda {{established}} her court in nearby Gloucester, still safely in the south-west but far enough away for her to remain independent of her half-brother. Although there had been only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>new</b> defections to her cause, Matilda still controlled a compact block of territory stretching out from Gloucester and Bristol south into Wiltshire, west into the Welsh Marches and east through the Thames Valley as far as Oxford and Wallingford, threatening London. Her influence extended down into Devon and Cornwall, and north through Herefordshire, but her authority in these areas remained limited.|$|E

During the 1970s and beyond, the quantity produced rose considerably.|$|E

50|$|The FEMRR {{operated}} up to nine {{diesel-electric locomotives}} built between 1944 and 1954. The 1958 roster shown below is probably representative of FEMRR motive power through the mid-1960s, though <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>newer</b> locomotives replaced some older ones listed here, particularly as steam was phased out.|$|R

5|$|The white {{supremacist}} scientist Robert Wilson Shufeldt reviewed Animal Coloration in Science in 1892, praising it as a concise and useful {{summary of the}} subject.

In the end, a year later {{at the age of}} 12, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, returned to her old hobbies, and adopted <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>new</b> ones (fueled by new, more nuanced core memories from combinations of her emotions).

5|$|The Final Fantasy Iâ€¢II {{collection}} {{included the}} original game with only minor changes. The WonderSwan Color {{remake of the}} game was first released on May 3, 2001, and later included as a bundle with a special Final Fantasy II edition of the console. It included completely redone graphics {{in the manner of}} the 16-bit generation Final Fantasy games and includes larger character sprites, remixed music by Tsuyoshi Sekito, and full graphical backgrounds in battle mode.

40|$|Current {{simulators}} for shared-memory multiprocessor architectures {{involve a}} large tradeoff between simulation speed and accuracy.
