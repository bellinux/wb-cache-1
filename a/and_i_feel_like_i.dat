500|$|Actress Kristen Bell {{was cast}} {{as the voice of}} Anna on March 5, 2012. Lee {{admitted}} that Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened to a series of vocal tracks Bell had recorded when she was young, where the actress performed several songs from The Little Mermaid, including [...] "Part of Your World". Bell completed her recording sessions while she was pregnant, and subsequently re-recorded some of her character's lines after her pregnancy, as her voice had deepened.

Their posture was too good and they were too well-spoken, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> really made this girl much more relatable and weirder and scrappier and more excitable and awkward. I'm really proud of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{splitting}} {{his time}} in the 2013 season between the Fightin Phils and the Lehigh Valley Iron Pigs (Class AAA – International League), Buchanan attended a Prospect Education Program hosted by the Phillies organization in January 2014. At the time, {{he was the only one}} of the eight attendees who had not been invited to major league camp at spring training, however after taking a [...] "leadership role" [...] at the program, Joe Jordan (the Phillies' director of player development) and manager Ryne Sandberg tendered Buchanan an invitation to big league camp. He entered camp competing for a spot in the Phillies rotation, and impressed the Phillies' staff, ultimately becoming a finalist for the position with Jeff Manship. He did not make the opening day roster despite his strong performance, but would remain in consideration for promotion during the 2014 season, particularly as a spot starter or even the Phillies' fifth starter if needed due to injury. Buchanan commented, [...] "I wanted to come in here and make an impression and open us some eyes <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> did that. I feel like I proved myself that I am ready for the next level. I had a blast every day in camp." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That 'll do, then! I {{want you}} to have him come back and write for the book when he gets well. I {{want you to}} find out and let me know if there's {{anything}} I can do for him. I'll feel as if I done it--for my--son. I'll take him into my own house, and do for him there, if you say so, when he gets so he can be moved. I'll wait on him myself. It's what Coonrod 'd do, if he was here. I don't feel any hardness to him because it was him that got Coonrod killed, as you might say, in one sense of the term; but I've tried to think it out, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was all the more beholden to him because my son died tryin' to save him. Whatever I do, I'll be doin' it for Coonrod, and that's enough for me." [...] He seemed to have finished, and he turned to March as if to hear what he had to say.|$|E

5000|$|She told tonedeaf.com.au {{that the}} album “is louder, and there’s much more distortion, {{the songs are}} bigger; there’s a lot more going on even though I’ve still kept that minimal aesthetic.” She also stated that she chose Lindsay Gravina to produce the album because “he knows my {{evolution}} as a songwriter and how to bring out my best. Working solo is way more intense <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> can really trust him with my music; something I don’t readily do. It’s certainly hard to get past my guard.

5000|$|Tied with Plushenko artistically (both scored 82.80 {{for program}} components), the win for Lysacek became {{possible}} due to higher marks he received on {{the execution of}} such technical elements as jumps, spins and footwork. Commenting on Lysacek receiving higher technical marks than Plushenko, Frank Carroll, Lysacek's coach, said: [...] "Plushenko was brilliant in the jumping. He did some brilliant, very difficult things. But {{if you think of}} his skating, he was very brilliant, then down. And very brilliant, then down. It was going in waves. Evan just sort of stayed in a straight line and kept going at a certain level from the start to the finish." [...] Lysacek agreed with Carroll's assessment as to why he was able to prevail over the three- time Olympic medalist, whose technical prowess had always been his trademark: [...] "If it was a jumping competition, they'd give you 10 seconds to go do your best jump. But it's about 4 minutes and 40 seconds of skating and performing from start to finish. That was my challenge tonight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> did quite well." ...|$|E
