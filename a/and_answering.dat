5|$|When Geta died in 211, her {{responsibilities}} increased because Caracalla found {{administrative tasks}} to be mundane. She {{may have taken}} upon {{one of the more}} important civil functions of the emperor; receiving petitions <b>and</b> <b>answering</b> correspondence. The extent of her role in this position, however, is probably overstated. She may have represented her son and played a role in meetings <b>and</b> <b>answering</b> queries; however, the final authority on legal matters was Caracalla. When Caracalla was murdered, Julia was in Antioch sorting out correspondence, removing unimportant messages from the bunch so that when Caracalla returned, he would not be overburdened with duties. The emperor filled all of the roles in the legal system as judge, legislator, and administrator.|$|E

Altgens and his wife Clara died in 1995 {{at about the same}} time in their Dallas home. Both had suffered from long illnesses, and police said poisoning by a malfunctioning furnace also may have contributed to their deaths.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs are {{sensitive}} to light intensity, and emerge at twilight, calling numerous times <b>and</b> <b>answering</b> their neighbors' calls before going off to forage. Just before dawn, they also communicate again {{on their way to}} their sleep site. Cold temperatures can also cause individuals to retire to their sleeping site as early as two hours before dawn. Their eye shine creates a unique pattern among lemurs because they tend to bob their heads up and down and from side to side.|$|E

5|$|Each {{contestant}} had {{the same}} decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt {{to answer the question}} or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question <b>and</b> <b>answering</b> incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their question {{at the end of the}} tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{investigate}} {{the interplay between}} <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed across question types in community question-answering sites (CQAs). The research questions addressed are the following: (a) How do <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed vary across question types? (b) How do the relationships between <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed vary across question types? (c) How do the best quality <b>answers</b> <b>and</b> the fastest <b>answers</b> differ in terms of <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed across question types? (d) How do trends in answer quality vary over time across question types? From the posting of 3, 000 questions in six CQAs, 5, 356 <b>answers</b> were harvested <b>and</b> analyzed. There {{was a significant difference}} in <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed across question types, and there were generally no significant relationships between <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed. The best quality answers had better overall answer quality than the fastest answers but generally took longer to arrive. In addition, although the trend in answer quality had been mostly random across all question types, the quality of answers appeared to improve gradually when given time. By highlighting the subtle nuances in <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed across question types, this study is an attempt to explore a territory of CQA research that has hitherto been relatively uncharted...|$|R

25|$|To advance {{from one}} rank to the next, {{students}} typically complete promotion tests {{in which they}} demonstrate their proficiency in the {{various aspects of the}} art before their teacher or a panel of judges.

For higher dan tests, students are sometimes required to take a written test or submit a research paper in addition to taking the practical test.|$|E
25|$|After {{retiring}} from the service, Lord Haig devoted {{the rest of his}} life to the welfare of ex-servicemen, making many speeches (which did not come easily to him) <b>and</b> <b>answering</b> all letters in his own hand. Haig pushed for the amalgamation of organisations, quashing a suggestion of a separate organisation for officers, into The British Legion which was founded in June 1921. He visited South Africa in 1921, Newfoundland in 1924, and Canada in 1925 (visits to Australia and New Zealand were being planned when he died) to promote ex-servicemen's interests. He was instrumental in setting up the Haig Fund for the financial assistance of ex-servicemen and the Haig Homes charity to ensure they were properly housed; both continue to provide help many years after they were created.|$|E
