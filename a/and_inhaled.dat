25|$|All {{magnetrons}} {{contain a}} small amount of thorium mixed with tungsten in their filament. While this is a radioactive metal, the risk of cancer is low as it never gets airborne in normal usage. Only if the filament is taken out of the magnetron, finely crushed, <b>and</b> <b>inhaled</b> can it pose a health hazard.|$|E

25|$|Some {{magnetrons}} have {{beryllium oxide}} (beryllia) ceramic insulators, which are dangerous if crushed <b>and</b> <b>inhaled,</b> or otherwise ingested. Single or chronic exposure {{can lead to}} berylliosis, an incurable lung condition. In addition, beryllia is listed as a confirmed human carcinogen by the IARC; therefore, broken ceramic insulators or magnetrons should not be directly handled.|$|E
25|$|Clocks, watches, and {{instruments}} {{dating from the}} first half of the 20th century, often in military applications, may have been painted with radioactive luminous paint. They are usually no longer luminous; however, this is not due to radioactive decay of the radium (which has a half-life of 1600 years) but to the fluorescence of the zinc sulfide fluorescent medium being worn out by the radiation from the radium. The appearance of an often thick layer of green or yellowish brown paint in devices from this period suggests a radioactive hazard. The radiation dose from an intact device is relatively low and usually not an acute risk; but the paint is dangerous if released <b>and</b> <b>inhaled</b> or ingested.|$|E
25|$|Morphine can {{be taken}} orally, sublingually, bucally, rectally, subcutaneously, intranasally, intravenously, intrathecally or epidurally <b>and</b> <b>inhaled</b> via a nebulizer. As a {{recreational}} drug, it is becoming more common to inhale ("Chasing the Dragon"), but, for medical purposes, intravenous (IV) injection {{is the most common}} method of administration. Morphine is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism (a large proportion is broken down in the liver), so, if taken orally, only 40% to 50% of the dose reaches the central nervous system. Resultant plasma levels after subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM), and IV injection are all comparable. After IM or SC injections, morphine plasma levels peak in approximately 20min, and, after oral administration, levels peak in approximately 30min. Morphine is metabolised primarily in the liver and approximately 87% of a dose of morphine is excreted in the urine within 72h of administration. Morphine is metabolized primarily into morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) via glucuronidation by phase II metabolism enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl transferase-2B7 (UGT2B7). About 60% of morphine is converted to M3G, and 6% to 10% is converted to M6G. Not only does the metabolism occur in the liver but it may also take place in the brain and the kidneys. M3G does not undergo opioid receptor binding and has no analgesic effect. M6G binds to μ-receptors and is half as potent an analgesic as morphine in humans. Morphine may also be metabolized into small amounts of normorphine, codeine, and hydromorphone. Metabolism rate is determined by gender, age, diet, genetic makeup, disease state (if any), and use of other medications. The elimination half-life of morphine is approximately 120min, though there may be slight differences between men and women. Morphine can be stored in fat, and, thus, can be detectable even after death. Morphine can cross the blood–brain barrier, but, because of poor lipid solubility, protein binding, rapid conjugation with glucuronic acid and ionization, it does not cross easily. Diacetylmorphine, which is derived from morphine, crosses the blood–brain barrier more easily, making it more potent.|$|E

500|$|As {{protactinium}} {{is present}} in small amounts in most natural products and materials, it is ingested with food or water <b>and</b> <b>inhaled</b> with air. Only about 0.05% of ingested protactinium is absorbed into the blood and the remainder is excreted. From the blood, about 40% of the protactinium ...|$|E
2500|$|Cigarettes: Cigarettes, French for [...] "small cigar", are {{a product}} {{consumed}} through smoking and manufactured out of cured and finely cut tobacco leaves and reconstituted tobacco, often {{combined with other}} additives, which are then rolled or stuffed into a paper-wrapped cylinder. Cigarettes are ignited <b>and</b> <b>inhaled,</b> usually through a cellulose acetate filter, into the mouth and lungs.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, {{two local}} trade unions complained of {{pollution}} within the plant. In 1981, a worker was accidentally splashed with phosgene {{as he was}} carrying out a maintenance job of the plant's pipes. In a panic, he removed his gas mask <b>and</b> <b>inhaled</b> {{a large amount of}} toxic phosgene gas, leading to his death just 72 hours later.|$|E

2500|$|From the {{perspective}} of the person receiving sedative, the effect is a feeling of general relaxation, amnesia (loss of memory) and time passing quickly. [...] Many drugs can produce a sedative effect including benzodiazepines, propofol, thiopental, ketamine <b>and</b> <b>inhaled</b> general anesthetics. [...] The advantage of sedation over a general anesthetic is that it generally does not require support of the airway or breathing (no tracheal intubation or mechanical ventilation) and can have less of an effect on the cardiovascular system which may add to a greater margin of safety in some patients.|$|E
2500|$|Anesthesia is {{administered}} to prevent pain from an incision, tissue manipulation and suturing. [...] Based on the procedure, anesthesia may be provided locally or as general anesthesia. [...] Spinal anesthesia {{may be used}} when the surgical site is too large or deep for a local block, but general anesthesia may not be desirable. [...] With local and spinal anesthesia, the surgical site is anesthetized, but the patient can remain conscious or minimally sedated. [...] In contrast, general anesthesia renders the patient unconscious and paralyzed during surgery. [...] The patient is intubated and is placed on a mechanical ventilator, and anesthesia is produced {{by a combination of}} injected <b>and</b> <b>inhaled</b> agents.|$|E
2500|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that the decline in lung function observed in chronic bronchitis may be slowed with smoking cessation. Chronic bronchitis is treated symptomatically and may be treated in a nonpharmacologic manner or with pharmacologic therapeutic agents. Typical nonpharmacologic approaches to the management of COPD including bronchitis may include: pulmonary rehabilitation, lung volume reduction surgery, and lung transplantation. Inflammation and edema of the respiratory epithelium may be reduced with inhaled corticosteroids. Wheezing and shortness of breath can be treated by reducing bronchospasm (reversible narrowing of smaller bronchi due to constriction of the smooth muscle) [...] with bronchodilators such as inhaled long acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonists (e.g., salmeterol) <b>and</b> <b>inhaled</b> anticholinergics such as ipratropium bromide or tiotropium bromide. Mucolytics may have a small therapeutic effect on acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Supplemental oxygen is used to treat hypoxemia (too little oxygen in the blood) and {{has been shown to}} reduce mortality in chronic bronchitis patients. Oxygen supplementation can result in decreased respiratory drive, leading to increased blood levels of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) and subsequent respiratory acidosis.|$|E

50|$|Interaction between smoking <b>and</b> <b>inhaling</b> {{asbestos}} fibres: Both raise lung carcinoma risk, but {{exposure to}} asbestos multiplies the cancer risk in smokers and non-smokers.
