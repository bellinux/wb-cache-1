5|$|Headed by Saint Peter, the Apostles {{are dressed}} in white robes <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> two facing benches set below Christ {{and to the right}} and left of the choir of virgins. Two angels attend to the groups {{gathered}} at each side of the benches. A further two angels are positioned immediately above Christ. They hold his cross and {{are dressed in}} white amice and albs, with the right hand angel wearing an outer blue dalmatic vestment. They are flanked on either side by angels playing long wind instruments, probably trumpets. The two angels on either side of Christ bear the symbols of the crucifixion already represented on the left hand panel. The angel on the left holds a lance and crown of thorns, the angel on the right a sponge and nails.|$|E
5|$|In Abzû, {{the player}} {{takes on the}} role of a diver in a vast ocean—after waking up {{floating}} on the ocean's surface, the diver begins exploring the surrounding underwater environments filled with plant and animal life, in addition to uncovering ancient technology and submerged ruins. In a few areas, the diver is also able to explore land-based environments above the water. As the game progresses, the diver unlocks new areas and pursues the secrets behind the forces harming the local environment. The diver's course through the game follows a linear path through interconnected areas filled with marine life. The player directs the diver through the environments using full analogue control, able to interact with the environment to solve switch or item-based puzzles, <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> pedestals within each area to observe the surrounding sea life. The diver can accelerate, and interact with marine life using sonar chimes. The diver can grab onto the bodies of larger marine animals and ride on them. Each area sports hidden collectables for the diver to find.|$|E

25|$|Vibrational therapy {{by way of}} {{sinusoidal}} (high-frequency oscillating) {{electric current}} was discovered by Kellogg in 1884 to have medical use for increasing blood circulation and passive exercise. In particular, Kellogg invented a vibrating chair used to stimulate vital organs in the lower abdomen. Even today one can visit the Kellogg Discovery Center in Battle Creek, Michigan, <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> Kellogg's vibrating chair, which is equipped to mechanically oscillate 20 times per second. Furthermore, Kellogg devised an electrotherapy exercise bed in which a sinusoidal current that produced muscular contraction but no pain could be delivered for twenty minutes and reportedly achieve the stimulation of a brisk four-mile walk.|$|E
25|$|In 968 Boris II, future {{emperor of}} Bulgaria, went to Constantinople again to {{negotiate}} a peace settlement with Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas, and apparently {{to serve as an}} honorary hostage. This arrangement was intended {{to put an end to}} the conflict between Bulgaria and Byzantium, which would now join forces against Prince Sviatoslav I of Kiev, whom the Byzantine emperor had pitted against the Bulgarians. In 969 a new Kievan invasion defeated the Bulgarians again, and Peter I abdicated to become a monk. In circumstances that are not entirely clear, Boris II was allowed to return to Bulgaria <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> his father's throne.|$|E
25|$|The five active {{chimneys}} of Loki's Castle are venting {{water as}} hot as 300 °C (570 °F) <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> a vast mound of sulfide minerals which is about 825ft (250 m) in diameter at its base, and some 300 feet (90 m) across its top. A member of the 2008 expedition, oceanographer Marvin Lilley has speculated {{that this may be}} the largest such deposit ever seen on the sea floor. The active chimneys are mostly black in colour, but are covered with mats of white bacteria which are living on minerals and materials emitted by the vents. The older chimneys are a mottled red colour, due to the presence of deposits of oxidised iron.|$|E

Up to five Liberal MPs in the lower house and one Senator stated they would consider crossing the floor to bring on debate on a same-sex marriage bill, even if the party rejects a free vote and maintains its plebiscite policy. The legislation, drafted by Senator Smith, was revealed the day prior to the party room meeting. In response to {{the prospect of the}} Liberal Party potentially moving to a free vote, Nationals MP Andrew Broad stated he would quit the Coalition <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the crossbench, saying the likely outcome of such a decision would be the fall of the Turnbull Government.|$|E
25|$|The corpse is {{washed and}} placed on tiger or deer skin or a bed of kusha grass. The hair and feet of the corpse may be tied. The corpse is {{believed}} to be a vessel of power while the rite is performed and tying the hair ensures that the energy does not escape. Another interpretation states that the bondage reflects the practitioner's desire to control the spirit of the corpse. Then, the sadhaka will sit on the corpse for meditation. In Shakta narratives, betel nut is put into the corpse's mouth and it is turned on its back and smeared with sandalwood paste. Shakta sandhakas draw a yantra {{on the back of the}} corpse <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> it. The 64 yoginis and the guardians of the directions are worshipped with vegetarian offerings. The corpse-seat is again worshipped and the practitioner mounts the corpse like one sits on a horse. Another tradition says that the practitioner is expected to sit in Virasana ("the heroic pose"). The Tantrasara narrates that the practitioner should get off the corpse to draw a triangle or protective circle around him and the corpse or again to scatter mustard or sesame seeds in all directions.|$|E

500|$|Greece Athena High School {{basketball}} coach Jim Johnson decided to add McElwain to the roster for the team's February 15 game against Spencerport High School, so McElwain {{could be given}} a jersey <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the bench for the team's last home game of the season, and allow McElwain to play a few minutes if Greece Athena got a comfortable lead. With four {{minutes left in the}} game, Greece Athena had a double-digit lead, so Johnson decided to let McElwain play out the last minutes of the game. When teammates first passed the ball to McElwain he attempted a three-point shot and missed. McElwain got a second chance to score with a lay-up which he also missed. McElwain then got [...] "hot as a pistol", sinking six three-pointers and one two-point shot, before the game ended. The final score was Greece Athena 79, Spencerport 43. As soon as the final buzzer rang, fans from the stands stormed the court in celebration.|$|E
500|$|In nature, {{this is a}} {{rainforest}} {{tree that}} can reach 33m (108ft) in height with a diameter at breast height (dbh) of 0.6m (24in), although in cultivation 10m (35ft) is more likely. The trunk has light grey bark with brown lenticels. New branchlets and leaves are hairy. The green foliage consists of several distinct juvenile and adult leaf forms, which are arranged alternately along the stems. Very young plants begin with their first two to four leaves having two or three lobes, but then have narrow [...] leaves with entire margins, measuring 6.5 to 18cm (2.6–7.2in) long and 1.3–2.2cm (0.5–0.8in) wide. These are then succeeded by pinnate juvenile leaves that have two to nine lobes arising at 30 to 40degrees forwards, and reach 50cm (20in) long. They have prominent midveins along the midline of the main leaf and the lobes. The elliptic or [...] (egg-shaped) adult leaves are 8–25cm (3.2–10in) long and up to 4.5cm (1.8in) wide, <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> 1.5 to 2.5-cm (0.6–1in) long petioles.|$|E

500|$|MGM {{executives}} screened Greed at {{full length}} once to meet contractual obligations. Idwal Jones, a San Francisco critic, attended the all-day screening and wrote {{that while some}} of the scenes were compelling, Stroheim's desire that [...] "every comma of the book [...] put in" [...] was ultimately negative. MGM then took control and re-edited it. The studio ordered June Mathis to cut it down further; she assigned the job to an editor named Joseph W. Farnham. Farnham was a well-known [...] "titles editor", who patched scenes together using title cards to keep continuity. His contributions to Greed include the notorious title cards [...] "Such was McTeague" [...] and [...] "Let's go over <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the sewer", which were snickered at for years. Eventually Farnham reduced Greed to 10 reels, totaling [...] Von Stroheim said that the film [...] "was cut by a hack with nothing on his mind but his hat." [...] He later bitterly lamented that Greed was made before the financial success of Eugene O'Neill's four-hour play Strange Interlude in 1928. Von Stroheim angrily disowned the final version, blaming Mathis for destroying his masterpiece.|$|E
500|$|When {{it became}} clear Taft would be renominated, Roosevelt and his {{supporters}} bolted the party; the former president asked Borah to chair the organizational meeting of his new Progressive Party, but the Idahoan refused. Borah would not countenance leaving the Republican Party and did not support any of the presidential candidates (the Democrats nominated New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson). [...] When Roosevelt came to Boise on a campaign swing in October, Borah {{felt he had to}} greet the former president <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the platform as Roosevelt spoke, though he was unwilling to endorse him. [...] Roosevelt told in his speech of a long list of state delegate votes he said had been stolen from him, and after each, turned to Borah and asked, [...] "Isn't that so, Senator Borah?" [...] giving him no choice but to nod. [...] It is not clear whether Borah voted for Roosevelt or Taft, he later stated both at different times. The main issue in Idaho was Borah's re-election, which was so popular that those disgruntled at the senator for not supporting Taft or Roosevelt kept quiet. Idahoans helped elect Wilson, but sent 80 Republican legislators out of 86 to Boise (with two of the six Democrats pledged to support Borah if necessary), who on January 14, 1913 returned William Borah for a second term.|$|E
