5000|$|Mind sharing {{is a way}} to get {{collective}} intelligence—crowd {{wisdom that}} is comparable to expert wisdom. The methodology for this is simple. You look for a consensus from the crowd—the answer that most minds are suggesting is the best answer. If it's <b>a</b> numeric <b>question</b> (<b>like</b> guessing the weight of an ox), it's a calculated average or median. If it's <b>an</b> open <b>question</b> (<b>like</b> [...] "what car should I buy?"), it's the most common answer.|$|R
60|$|LADY MOGTON It's not <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of <b>liking.</b> It's <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of duty. For this {{occasion}} {{we shall be}} appealing to the male voter. Our candidate must be a woman popular with men. The choice is somewhat limited.|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of <b>liking</b> him," [...] {{replied the}} Mule. [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of {{watching}} him and looking after him. Any boy who causes his friends so much worry isn't worth having around. I never get lost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{speak to}} him much," [...] said Mike cautiously. It is always {{delicate}} work answering <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>like</b> this unless one has {{some sort of an}} inkling as to the views of the questioner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Captain Cuffe, I cannot {{think of}} {{answering}} <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>like</b> {{that under the}} solemnity of an oath, as you call it. No one can know where the little Folly is but them that's in her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Three {{and three}} make six, three and three always have made six, and three and three always will make six!" [...] cried Fred in a girlish tone of voice. [...] "So what's {{the use of}} asking <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>like</b> that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I can't {{be worried}} about these things," [...] said Swann, in an acrimonious voice, as they entered. [...] "If you are not capable of {{settling}} <b>a</b> simple <b>question</b> <b>like</b> that yourself, ask the office-boy to instruct you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Like him!" [...] again {{shouted the}} doctor, and the assenting ravens again cawed an echo; [...] "of course, you don't like him: it's not <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of <b>liking.</b> But {{what are we}} to do with him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Miss Henley, what I most admire in your {{character}} is its lovely ingenuousness, its simplicity, its heart; and I will own I {{did not expect}} such an answer to <b>a</b> <b>question</b> put, <b>like</b> mine, in sincerity and truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lots of places," [...] {{said the}} captain, {{who was not}} {{prepared}} to answer <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>like</b> that offhand; [...] "but wherever I’ve been"—he held up his hand theatrically—"the image of my dear lost wife has been always in front of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do I keep {{on coming}} here?" [...] I repeated, taken by surprise. I {{could not have}} told her. I could not even tell myself with sincerity why I was coming there. [...] "What's the good of you asking <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>like</b> that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Religion too!--well, <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>like</b> this, now, {{would make}} a stir among our folks in New Hampshire! Look here, Signore; we don't call your ceremonies, and images, and robes, and ringing of bells, and bowing and scraping, a {{religion}} at all; any more than we should call this smooth liquor, wine." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{all four}} {{questions}} were played, the couple {{with the most}} points won the game and proceeded to a bonus round. If there was a tie, <b>a</b> toss-up <b>question</b> <b>like</b> the ones used in the bonus round itself (see below) was asked, with the winner advancing.|$|R
50|$|The 1911 {{referendum}} asked <b>a</b> single <b>question</b> {{that dealt}} with trade and commerce, corporations and industrial matters. This resolution separated each of those matters into <b>a</b> different <b>question.</b> <b>Like</b> its forebear, none of these resolutions were carried. On each of the many occasions <b>a</b> similar <b>question</b> was asked at a referendum the public decided not to vest power in the Commonwealth over these matters.|$|R
5000|$|The National Comprehensive Cancer Network {{recommends}} that every cancer patient be systematically screened for fatigue {{at the first}} visit with an oncologist, throughout treatment, and afterwards. [...] Screening typically involves <b>a</b> simple <b>question,</b> <b>like</b> [...] "On <b>a</b> {{scale of one to}} ten, how tired have you felt during the last week?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now see here, Amateur, there's no {{call for}} you to come 'round me with <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>like</b> that. I'm only too glad you've got a chance to get a holiday, and I advise you to spend all the time, till the hour for school, among your old chums. I don't reckon you've got any big pile of money left by this time, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Now <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>like</b> {{this might}} have been {{answered}} normally, either in accents of apologetic sorrow or with a visibly suppressed pride, in a [...] "I don't want to boast, but you shall see," [...] sort of tone. There are sailors, too, who would have been roughly outspoken: [...] "Lazy brute," [...] or openly delighted: [...] "She's a flyer." [...] Two ways, if four manners.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder how}} far {{you are willing to}} help me?" [...] Confoundedly hard to answer <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>like</b> that {{on the spur of the}} moment, without {{steering}} wildly. [...] "You may rely--" [...] said Mr. Hoopdriver, recovering from a violent wabble. [...] "I can assure you--I want to help you very much. Don't consider me at all. Leastways, consider me entirely at your service." [...] (Nuisance not to be able to say this kind of thing right.) ...|$|E

5000|$|In Newfoundland English, it {{is typical}} for a {{response}} to <b>a</b> metaphorical <b>question</b> <b>like</b> How's she cuttin'? with a dry, literal response. A proper response to the foresaid <b>question</b> would be <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> knife. (the question/greeting of [...] "How's she Cuttin'?" [...] is a phrase still current in the Irish midlands and north and rarely if ever responded to with such a literal answer) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Like it?" [...] {{burst out}} Lydgate, rising from his chair, {{thrusting}} {{his hands in}} his pockets and stalking away from the hearth; [...] "it's not <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of <b>liking.</b> Of course, I don't like it; it's the only thing I can do." [...] He wheeled round there, and turned towards her.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Bolton erected {{herself from}} cutting {{a loaf of}} her best bread into slices, and stood with the knife in her hand, like a figure of Justice. [...] "Well, I guess you no need to ask me <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>like</b> that, Miss Kilburn. I hain't obliged to make up to Mr. Peck, though, for what I done in the beginnin' by condemnin' everybuddy else without mercy now." [...] Mrs. Bolton's eyes did not flash fire, but they sent out an icy gleam that went as sharply to Annie's heart.|$|E
60|$|It {{was rather}} {{difficult}} for Junius Keswick to answer <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>like</b> {{this on the}} spur of the moment. He arose and walked with Croft out of the arbor. His first impulse, as a Virginia gentleman, was to invite his visitor to stay at the house until the matter should be settled, but he did not know what extraordinary freak on the part of his aunt might be caused by such an invitation. But before he had decided what to say, they were met by Mrs Keswick coming from the garden. Junius thereupon presented Mr Croft, who was welcomed by the old lady with extended hand and exceeding cordiality.|$|E
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>question</b> <b>like</b> {{this was}} well adapted {{to effect the}} speaker's wish to change the discourse, for it very {{naturally}} directed the attention of all present from a subject that was rather tolerated from idleness than interesting in itself, to the different natural phenomena by which they were surrounded. The sunset had now fairly passed, and the travellers were at the witching moment that precedes the final disappearance of the day. A calm so deep rested on the limpid lake, {{that it was not}} easy to distinguish the line which separated the two elements, in those places where the blue of the land was confounded with the well-known and peculiar color of the Leman.|$|E
5000|$|... "Toilet Takedown": In {{the first}} part, Forsberg will read <b>a</b> trivia <b>question</b> <b>like</b> 'How many toilets does Wembley Stadium have?'. The {{contestant}} must writer their answer on toilet paper, the contestant with the closest answer wins. In the second part, Forsberg {{will show the}} contestants a video on LooTube (a wordplay on YouTube) and ask <b>a</b> <b>question</b> asking {{what they think is}} going to happen next. The first person that flushes the toilet gets to answer.|$|R
5000|$|... • Confirmatory questions- {{also known}} as trial closes. What {{typically}} happens during these questions is establishing that the buyer is interested about the salesperson’s products/services {{and would like to}} continue to hear more about them.

6000|$|... "Ah, now, I'm {{more at home}} in <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>like</b> that. You {{might say}} that if He lets evil prevail, it's either because He can't help it, or because He don't care, or even because He thinks it's best for mankind to let them have their swing when they choose to do evil. I incline to think that's my idea. He's made man, we'll say, made him in His own image, and He's put him here {{in a world of}} his own, to do the best or the worst with it. The way I look at it, He doesn't want to keep interfering with man, but lets him play the fool or play the devil just as he's a mind to. But every now and then He sends him word. If we're going to take what the Book says, He sent him Word made flesh, once, and I reckon He sends him Word made Spirit {{whenever}} there's a human creature comes into the world, all loving and all unselfish--like your Joey, or--my--my Jimmy--" ...|$|E
6000|$|If {{these views}} are correct, why may not an English writer secure a {{right in this}} country, by selling it in season, to a citizen here? An {{equitable}} trust might not, probably would not be sufficient; but a bona fide transfer for a valuable consideration, I begin to think, would. It {{seems to me that}} all the misconception which has existed on this point has arisen from supposing that the term publication refers to other than a publication in the country. But, when one remembers how rare it is to get lawyers to agree on <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>like</b> this, it becomes a layman to advance his opinion with great humility. I suppose, after all a good way of getting an accurate notion of the meaning of the law, would be to toss a dollar into the air, and cry [...] "heads," [...] or [...] "tails." [...] Sir Walter Scott seemed fully aware of the great circulation of his books in America, as well as how much he lost by not being able to secure a copyright. Still he admitted they produced him something. Our conversation on this subject terminated by a frank offer, on his part, of aiding me with the publishers of his own country;[16] but, although grateful for the kindness, I was not so circumstanced as to be able to profit by it.|$|E
60|$|It {{may seem}} strange that <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>like</b> this, which related, {{as it would}} appear, to only an empty title, should have been deemed so important; but, in reality, there was {{something}} more than the mere title at issue. Although, for the time being, the Christians were excluded from Jerusalem, they were all continually hoping to be very soon restored to the possession of it, and then {{the king of the}} city would become a very important personage, not only in his own estimation and in that of the army of Crusaders, but in that of all Christendom. No one knew but that in a few months Jerusalem might come into their hands, either by being retaken through force of arms, or by being ceded in some way through Richard's negotiations with Saladin; and, of course, the greater the probability was that this event would happen, the more important the issue of the quarrel became, and the more angry with each other, and excited, were the parties to it. Thus Richard found that all his plans for getting possession of Jerusalem were grievously impeded by these dissensions; for the nearer he came, at any time, to the realization of his hopes, the more completely were his efforts to secure the end paralyzed by the increased violence and bitterness of the quarrel that reigned among his followers.|$|E

I have asked you <b>a</b> <b>question</b> {{something}} <b>like</b> this before, but I want to repeat it. I have told you that Louise refuses to marry me. She has something on her mind, some scruple, some fear. Can you form any idea as to what it may be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{you have}} found out, I am a frank old woman and not afraid to say what I think. Now, I {{want to ask you}} <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> If you <b>liked</b> <b>a</b> man who was far from rich, would you marry him?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Note the {{interrogative}} particle czy, {{which is used}} to start <b>a</b> yes/no <b>question,</b> much <b>like</b> the French [...] "est-ce que". The particle is not obligatory, and sometimes rising intonation is the only signal of the interrogative character of the sentence.|$|R
