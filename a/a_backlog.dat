5|$|Issues {{that affect}} water {{supply in the}} United States include {{droughts}} in the West, water scarcity, pollution, <b>a</b> <b>backlog</b> of investment, concerns about the affordability of water for the poorest, and a rapidly retiring workforce. Increased variability and intensity of rainfall {{as a result of}} climate change is expected to produce both more severe droughts and flooding, with potentially serious consequences for water supply and for pollution from combined sewer overflows.|$|E
5|$|The strike action led to <b>a</b> <b>backlog</b> {{of tens of}} {{millions}} of items of undelivered mail, with an estimated 30 million letters and parcels affected after the first wave of walkouts, and rising to in excess of 50 million following the second. Businesses in London were forced to lay off staff, or defer paying them, generally because they were unable to dispatch goods or couldn't receive payment for them. However, the strikes had less of an impact outside the capital.|$|E
5|$|While {{public schools}} {{remained}} open during the shutdown, and teachers {{continued to be}} paid following Gearin's ruling, the shutdown interfered with their operations, and would have caused serious problems if it had continued. Teachers could not renew or receive new licenses during the shutdown, creating <b>a</b> <b>backlog,</b> and property tax levy approvals could have been delayed. No fishing, hunting, and boating licenses or new drivers' licenses were issued during the shutdown. Taxes continued to be due, but tax refunds stopped.|$|E

5|$|A {{controversial}} plan, {{known as}} the Major Moves plan, was passed in 2006. The Indiana Toll Road was leased to Statewide Mobility Partners, a joint venture company owned by Spanish firm Cintra and Australia's Macquarie Infrastructure Group for 75 years {{in exchange for a}} one time payment of $3.85 billion. The measure was opposed by most Democrats, who began an advertising campaign accusing Daniels of selling the road to foreign nations. The income from the lease was used to finance <b>a</b> <b>backlog</b> of public transportation projects and create a $500 million trust fund to generate revenue for the maintenance of the highway system.|$|E
5|$|Between July and December 1941, the {{garrison}} received 8,500 reinforcements. After years of parsimony, much equipment was shipped. By November, <b>a</b> <b>backlog</b> of 1,100,000 shipping tons of equipment {{intended for the}} Philippines had accumulated in U.S. ports and depots awaiting vessels. In addition, the Navy intercept station in the islands, known as Station CAST, had an ultra secret Purple cipher machine, which decrypted Japanese diplomatic messages, and partial codebooks for the latest JN-25 naval code. Station CAST sent MacArthur its entire output, via Sutherland, the only officer on his staff authorized to see it.|$|E
5|$|On a {{personal}} level, Grace was still unqualified {{as a doctor}} and had a growing family to support, his daughter Bessie being born in May. When not playing cricket, he had to study <b>a</b> <b>backlog</b> of medical theory. He did not qualify as a doctor {{until the end of}} the following year. He then needed a practice and this was effectively purchased for him by MCC in 1878 after they launched a National Testimonial on his behalf, though the underlying and hopeful purpose of the appeal was to terminate Grace's embarrassing mercenary activity.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe analyse the {{performance}} of an incentive scheme for two- hop DTNs in which <b>a</b> <b>backlogged</b> source proposes <b>a</b> fixed reward to the relays to deliver a message. Only one mes- sage at a time is proposed by source. For a given message, only the first relay to deliver this message gets the reward corresponding to this message thereby inducing a competi- tion between the relays. The relays seek to maximize the expected reward for each message whereas {{the objective of the}} source is to satisfy a given constraint on the probabil- ity of message delivery. We show that the optimal policy of a relay is of threshold type: it accepts a message until a first threshold and then keeps the message until it either meets the destination or reaches the second threshold. For- mulas for computing the thresholds as well as probability of message delivery are derived for <b>a</b> <b>backlogged</b> source. Ex- plicit expressions are obtained for this scenario in the limit- ing regime where the number of relays is large...|$|R
5|$|After new {{investment}} at board level Revie {{was able to}} spend £25,000 on Everton's Scotland international Bobby Collins, who he installed as captain. Other arrivals included former Manchester City teammate Billy McAdams, forward Ian Lawson and left-back Cliff Mason. He spent £53,000 to bring John Charles back from Juventus, and though he proved not to {{be as effective as}} during his first spell at Leeds, Revie was able to sell him on to Roma for a £17,000 profit within just a few months. Leeds pushed for promotion in 1962–63, but the harsh winter caused many postponements and <b>a</b> <b>backlog</b> of games {{at the end of the}} season proved too much for Leeds, who fell away to finish in fifth place.|$|E
5|$|Grace {{was living}} in Gloucestershire in 1878. He and his wife Agnes had moved to London in February 1875 when he was {{assigned}} to St Bartholomew's Hospital to further his medical education. They lived in an Earl's Court apartment until autumn 1877 when they returned to Gloucestershire and lived with Grace's elder brother Henry, who was a general practitioner (GP) at Kingswood, near Bristol. The Graces already had two sons and their third child Bessie was born in May 1878. When not playing cricket, Grace had to study <b>a</b> <b>backlog</b> of medical theory and, after the season ended, {{he was assigned to}} Westminster Hospital for his final year of medical practice; the family moved back to London and lived at Acton until he finally qualified in November 1879.|$|E
5|$|Tharoor's {{career in}} the United Nations began in 1978 as a staff member of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Geneva.

After a further stint at the UNHCR headquarters in Geneva, during which he became the first chairman of the staff elected by UNHCR personnel worldwide, Tharoor left UNHCR. In 1989 he was appointed special assistant to the Under-Secretary General for Special Political Affairs, the unit that later became the Peacekeeping Operations Department in New York. Until 1996, he led the team responsible for peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia, spending considerable time on the ground during the civil war there.|$|E

5|$|From {{the sixteenth}} century, the central {{government}} became increasingly involved in local affairs. The feud was limited and regulated, local taxation became much more intrusive and from 1607 regular, local commissions of Justices of the Peace on the English model were established to deal with petty crimes and infractions. Greater control was exerted over the lawless Borders through a joint commission with the English set up in 1587. James VI was much more hostile to the culture and particularism of the Highlands than his predecessors. He sent colonists from Fife to parts {{of the region and}} forced the Highland chiefs to accept Lowland language and culture through the Statues of Iona 1609. From the seventeenth century the function of shires expanded from judicial functions into wider local administration. In 1667 Commissioners of Supply were appointed in each sheriffdom or shire to collect the cess land tax. The parish also became an important unit of local government, pressured by Justices in the early eighteenth century, it became responsible for taking care of the destitute in periods of famine, like that in 1740, to prevent the impoverished from taking to the roads and causing general disorder. Behaviour could be regulated through kirk sessions, composed of local church elders, which replaced the church courts of the Middle Ages, and which dealt with moral and religious conduct. The local court baron remained important in regulating minor interpersonal and property offences. They were held {{at the behest of the}} local baron when there was <b>a</b> <b>backlog</b> of cases and could appoint birleymen, usually senior tenants, who would resolve disputes and issues. The combination of kirk sessions and courts baron gave considerable power to local lairds to control the behaviour of the populations of their communities.|$|E
