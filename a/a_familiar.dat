5|$|Annalee Call was {{originally}} written for Angelina Jolie; although Jolie auditioned, she {{turned down the}} role and Winona Ryder was cast in December 1996. Call had a generally negative critical reception, largely due to a perceived lack of synergy with the film and the franchise. Roger Ebert praised Ryder's acting, but felt {{that she did not}} bring a strong presence or purpose to the film except as <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> face to younger viewers. Nordling agreed in a 2012 Ain't It Cool News analysis, saying that Call's synthetic origin is unnecessary and her only role is that of a surrogate audience.|$|E
5|$|Game hunting was <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> {{beneficial}} {{skill to}} the colonists when they {{immigrated to the}} New World. Most northern colonists depended upon hunting, whether they hunted themselves or purchased game from others. As a method of obtaining protein for consumption, hunting was preferred over animal husbandry as domestic animals were expensive and more work was required to defend domestic animals against natural predators, Native Americans, or the French. Commonly hunted game included deer, bear, buffalo, and turkey. The larger parts of the animals were roasted and served with currant and other sauces, while smaller portions went into soups, stews, sausages, pies, and pasties.|$|E

These children {{are more likely to have}} later social problems with peers and teachers, but some of them spontaneously develop better ways of interacting with other people.|$|E
5|$|Prince Sadruddin had a {{taste for}} culture, {{including}} music, art and literature. He was <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> figure at music festivals and other cultural events, both in Europe and overseas. His {{concern for the environment}} was complemented by his enjoyment of the outdoors; he was a keen skier and an accomplished sailor. While still at Harvard in 1953, Prince Sadruddin became the founding publisher of the Paris Review, which was established with the aim of bringing original creative work to the fore. Every year the Review awards the Aga Khan Prize for Fiction (established by his father) for the best short story that it published in the past year.|$|E

Common Cottongrass is <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> site on marshy land, but Saltmarsh Sedge (Carex salina) was only discovered {{for the first time}} in 2004 at the head of Loch Duich.|$|E

They are an important object of public discourse and media representation at the national level; however, Cluj-Napoca, with its small Roma population, has not been a major focus of Roma ethno-political activity.|$|E

5|$|The loud goose-like honking call is <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> sound, {{particularly}} during the breeding season; pairs often honk in unison, and often carry {{on for some time}} when perched.

Australian naturalist David Fleay observed that the call is among the loudest and furthest-carrying of all Australian bird calls, {{in stark contrast to the}} relatively quiet calls of the wedge-tailed eagle.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{church of}} St. James is also {{located near the}} centre of Taunton quite close to St. Mary Magdalene. The oldest parts of St. James Church are early 14th-century, and there are {{fragments}} of 15th-century glass in the west end. Like St. Mary's {{it also has a}} sandstone tower but built to a much less impressive design. The tower was also, like St. Mary's, rebuilt in the 19th century– in this case thought to be due to building defects in the original tower. The church backs onto the County Ground and forms <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> backdrop to the popular cricket ground.|$|E
5|$|Wilton {{returned}} for the series' 2005 Christmas special as Davies wanted to include <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> character whose presence would ease the transition following {{a change in}} the series' lead actor. Despite her character having been introduced as fair minded and hard working, Harriet is depicted as an uncompromising Prime Minister, which led to comparisons to real life politicians. Response to the character's political decisions prompted mixed commentary from the media; some reviewers felt that the character had acted unreasonably whilst others sympathised with her actions and felt her scripted political demise was unjust.|$|E
