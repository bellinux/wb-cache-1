This qualitative study intends to analyze the determination of days in the Hijriyah calendar. The main problem is the disagreement about the start of the day and where the beginning of the day begins. In contrast to the international community in general, Muslims have several criteria to determine where and when the day begins in Islam. There are three opinions about the beginning of the day.

30|$|The {{long period}} <b>astronomical</b> <b>cycles</b> (> 0.5 Myr periodicity) are {{predicted}} {{to have changed}} their frequencies through time due to the “chaotic” behavior of the inner planets, especially Earth-Mars secular resonance (e.g. Laskar, 1990; Laskar et al., 2004, 2011 a, b). The sensitivity tests on the solar oblateness, tidal dissipation factor, and integration step-size by Laskar et al. (2004, 2011 a, b) suggest that a significant frequency change of the long period <b>astronomical</b> <b>cycles</b> could have occurred before Neogene, and that their solution before Neogene may not be accurate enough for orbital tuning due to the uncertainty on {{the frequency of the}} long period <b>astronomical</b> <b>cycles.</b> If so, geological records of astronomically paced rhythms are the only evidence on actual frequency changes of these long period <b>astronomical</b> <b>cycles</b> in the past, and will be able to provide new constraints on orbital models with respect to the frequency modulation of the long period <b>astronomical</b> <b>cycles.</b> The eccentricity cycle related to the Earth-Mars secular resonance with the periodicity different from ~ 2.4 Myr were reported from the older part of the geological records such as ~ 1.6 Myr cycle in Early Cretaceous (Grippo et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2010 b), and ~ 2.0 Myr cycle in Late Jurassic (Huang et al., 2010 a), ~ 1.8 Myr cycle in Late Triassic (Olsen and Kent, 1999; Hüsing et al., 2011) and Middle Triassic (Ikeda et al., 2010 a), and ~ 1.5 Myr cycle in Late Permian to Early Triassic (Huang et al., 2011). However, so far no study has identified frequency transition of these long period cycles. To identify frequency transition of long period cycles, determine their precise timing, and describe the nature of frequency transition, long and continuous geological records of astronomically driven rhythms are needed.|$|R

This model was dismissed by scholars in the late 19 th century, calling it just a simple invention of a clergyman; however, {{a detailed analysis of}} Duquesne's work shows that his interpretation of the timekeeping system was based on information given to him by indigenous informers. Based on his work, we can be derive somewhat indirectly, some aspects of the calendar that apparently were not understood by the priest. This confirms that such a system was not his own invention. Ethnohistorical and archaeological evidence provide support for Duquesne's calendar model. Massive Muisca ceremonies described by 16 th century Spanish chroniclers, is examined and; the occurrence of such ceremonies seem to match the <b>astronomical</b> <b>cycle</b> of conjunctions of the planets Jupiter and Saturn, wich also agrees with the 60 -year span described by Duquesne as the Muisca Acrotom Century.

40|$|During the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic the Newark rift {{basin of}} the northeastern US {{accumulated}} in excess 5 km of continental, mostly lacustrine strata that show a profound cyclicity previously interpreted as {{caused by the}} astronomical forcing of tropical climate. The Newark record is known virtually in its entirety {{as a result of}} scientific and other coring and provides what is arguably one of the longest records of climate cyclicity available. Two proxies of water depth and hence climate in this record are a classification of sedimentary structures (depth ranks) and sediment colour. The depth rank and colour depth series display a full range of climatic precession related cycles. Here, we tune the depth rank and colour records to the 404 ka <b>astronomical</b> <b>cycle</b> and use this tuned record to explore the existence and origin of very longâ€“period climate. We find highly significant periods of climatic precession modulation at periods of ca. 1. 75 Ma, 1 Ma and 700 ka in not only the depth rank and colour records, but also in the sedimentation rate curve derived from the tuning process. We then use the colour and depth rank timeâ€“series to construct an astronomically tuned timeâ€“scale for the Late Triassic. While the Newark higherâ€“frequency eccentricity cycles that modulate precession are indistinguishable from today, the 1. 75 Ma cycle is significantly different from predictions based on the present day fundamental frequencies of the planets (i. e. 2. 5 Ma) and provides the first geological evidence of the chaotic behaviour of the inner planets, otherwise known only from numerical calculations...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} two earlier papers on {{convection}} in the mixed layer {{and on the}} solar heating profile are here introduced into a one-dimensional model in order to investigate the following consequences of the daily cycle of solar heating in the upper ocean: 1. the daytime convection depth becomes less than the turbocline depth; 2. the convective power supply to turbulence in the mixed layer is reduced; 3. the mixed layer below the convection layer becomes stably stratified; 4. {{the depth of the}} turbocline is reduced, leaving a diurnal thermocline between it and the top of the seasonal thermocline; 5. the heat content and potential energy of the diurnal and seasonal thermoclines are increased, slowing down the subsequent nocturnal descent of the turbocline. These diurnal changes are illustrated by integrating a one-dimensional model forced by the <b>astronomical</b> <b>cycle</b> of solar heating and seasonal variation of surface meteorology derived from Bunker's climatology. The model is integrated for 18 months to show the seasonal modulation of the diurnal cycle. Nocturnal convection plays a dominant role. The convection depth closely follows the thermal compensation depth during the day when they are less than the turbocline depth. Integrating the model with a 24 -hour time step leads to large errors in the seasonal variation of mixed layer temperature and depth, and in the source term of isopycnic potential vorticity. The errors are reduced by using two time steps per day, one for the daytime when convection is quenched, the other for the night when it is active. A novel parametrization based on tuning the daily equivalent solar elevation to surface temperature further reduces the error. This parametrization is used to investigate the sensitivity of the seasonal cycles of mixed layer depth and temperature to: (1) seasonality in the surface fluxes; (2) systematic changes in the net annual solar heating; (3) random changes in the seasonal cycles of solar heating induced (i) monthly and (ii) daily. The sensitivity to uncertainty in seawater turbidity is investigated in the same way. The profile of isopycnic potential vorticity subducted into the thermocline depends on the vernal correlation of mixed layer depth and density, so gyre circulation is sensitive to solar heating in spring...|$|E

30|$|To further {{examine the}} long period cycles in the {{sedimentary}} rhythms of bedded chert and confirm their <b>astronomical</b> <b>cycle</b> origin, we compare {{the nature of}} the frequency modulation of ~ 2 Myr cycle between our geological data and the orbital solutions of Laskar et al. (2004, 2011 a) during the period from Late Triassic to Early Jurassic. To compare the long period astronomical cycles in the geologic data with that of orbital solution with high frequency resolution, we conducted S-transform on the chert bed thickness time series and orbital solution of Laskar et al. (2004). The S-transform is a sophisticated wavelet analysis customized to better visualize the frequency modulation of low frequency cycles using a moving and scalable localizing Gaussian window (Stockwell et al., 1996). The orbital models of La 2004 and La 2010 were demonstrated as precise for the last 40 Myr and 50 Myr, respectively (Laskar et al., 2004, 2011 a, b). The main difference between the La 2004 and La 2010 models is that the initial conditions of La 2004 are adjusted to the JPL numerical ephemeris DE 406 (Standish, 1998) over − 5000 yr to + 1000 yr from the present date, while La 2010 is fit to the most precise planetary ephemeris INPOP 06 and INPOP 08 (Fienga et al., 2008, 2009). In particular, the La 2010 d version is adjusted to INPOP 06 over the last 1 Myr that includes the five major asteroids, Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, Iris, and Bamberga (Laskar et al., 2011 a), although La 2010 a, La 2010 b and La 2010 c are fit to INPOP 08 over only the last 580 kyr for the La 2010 a and La 2010 b, and over the last 1 Myr for La 2010 c, but La 2010 c does not include the five major asteroids. Thus, the La 2010 d version could be considered as the most constrained version in the La 2010 models (Laskar et al., 2011 a, b). Nevertheless, the orbital solutions for pre-Neogene time cannot be solved precisely due to the uncertainty in the frequency of the long period astronomical cycles that reflects the “chaotic” behavior of the inner planets, especially the ~ 2 Myr cycle of Earth-Mars secular resonance (Laskar et al., 2004, 2011 a, b). Here we examine the general trend and nature of frequency modulation and amplitude modulation of the ~ 2 Myr eccentricity cycle computed by the orbital models.|$|E
30|$|Orbital {{solutions}} {{suggested that}} the eccentricity cycles have negligible power in annual and seasonal insolation time series, although it does modulate the amplitude of the climatic precession, and the amplitude of seasonal insolation. According to the researches on <b>astronomical</b> <b>cycles</b> during Quaternary, it is generally thought that the ~ 100 kyr glacial-interglacial cycles are paced by the ~ 100 kyr eccentricity, which is amplified and/or rectified through non-linear internal climate feedback processes influenced through the amplitude modulation of the seasonal insolation by the eccentricity (e.g. Hays et al., 1976; Imbrie et al., 1993; Huybers and Wunsch, 2003). The signal of <b>astronomical</b> <b>cycles</b> detected in this study would also be amplified and/or rectified by similar internal non-linear processes(es). Similarly, we suggest that the ~ 8 Myr cycle in the chert bed thickness time series results from amplitude modulation of the ~ 2 Myr eccentricity cycle through non-linear amplification process(es). Boulila et al. (2012) {{suggested that the}} amplitude modulation of the ~ 2 Myr eccentricity cycle may {{play an important role}} in carbon cycling, controlling a chain of astro-climatically sensitive processes such as terrestrial weathering, biosphere productivity, carbonate sedimentation and dissolution, burial and oxidation of organic carbon, etc. (e.g., Pälike et al., 2006; Li et al., 2009). Although their potential link with the chert bed thickness variation is highly speculative, productivity is most likely related with the chert bed thickness variation (e.g. Hori et al., 1993). In addition, terrestrial weathering is also potentially a controlling factor of the chert bed thickness variation, because the extreme source of biogenic silica burial in the ocean is the dissolved silica from continents (e.g. Tréguer et al., 1995; Tréguer, 2002). The formation mechanism of bedded chert rhythms and their genetic relation to long period <b>astronomical</b> <b>cycles</b> would be a key for understanding this non-linear amplification process(es), which should be clarified in the future. The ~ 30 Myr orbitally-paced lake level records in the Newark Supergroup during Late Triassic will also provide additional constraints for this topic. These issues must be addressed for complete understanding of the impact of long period <b>astronomical</b> <b>cycles</b> on global surface environments.|$|R

30|$|In this study, we adopted {{method of}} Ikeda et al. (2010 a) to an Upper Triassic to Lower Jurassic bedded chert {{sequence}} that covers ~ 30 Myr interval, {{in order to}} identify orbital cycles and explore the evolution of long period <b>astronomical</b> <b>cycles.</b> Bedded chert consists of centimeter-scale rhythmical alternations of chert and shale beds whose rhythms are paced by precession and eccentricity cycles (e.g. Fischer, 1976; Hori et al., 1993; Ikeda et al., 2010 a). The sedimentary rhythms of bedded chert formed as a result of cyclic changes in the accumulation rate of biogenic SiO 2 within a background of extremely slow accumulation of pelagic clay (e.g. Hori et al., 1993). Additionally, bedded chert accumulated continuously on pelagic deep seafloor so that it covers a long time interval over hundreds of millions of years. Consequently, a bedded chert sequence has a potential to record the evolution of the long period <b>astronomical</b> <b>cycles.</b> We measured thickness of individual chert bed throughout the sequence, and confirmed ~ 20 kyr precession cycle origin of chert-shale couplet based on biostrati-graphic ages. We then constructed the astronomical time scale of the bedded chert sequence by tuning ~ 20 beds cycle to 405 kyr eccentricity cycle of constant duration, and conducted spectral analyses on the chert bed thickness time series to reconstruct temporal changes in the frequency and amplitude of ~ 2 Myr eccentricity cycle.
