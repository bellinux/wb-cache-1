500|$|Blane {{was amazed}} by the {{recreation}} and understanding of her designs by fans. When she first heard that people were dressing up, {{she thought it would}} be tacky, but was surprised to see the depth to which the fans went to recreate her designs. Rocky Horror fan Mina Credeur, who designs costumes and performed as Columbia for Houston’s performance group, states that [...] "the best part is when everyone leaves with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> on their face", noting that there's [...] "such a kitschiness and campiness that it seems to be winking at you". The film still plays at many theatre locations and Rocky Horror costumes are often made for Halloween, although many require much time and effort to make.|$|E
500|$|Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated [...] "What you {{get from}} this 18-year-old singer is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile,</b> a little voice, gushes of sincerity, hardworking dance routines, shameless {{advertising}} and a determination to play both sides of pubescence for all they're worth". Jim Farber of New York Daily News commented that [...] "Despite such spicy bits, the core of Britney's concert suffered from the familiarity and cheesiness of all teen road shows these days. The sparklers, explosions and mandatory flying dancers conformed to the corniness of theme park entertainment". [...] The ticket prices were set at $32 in North America. The reported dates averaged $507,786 in grosses and 15,841 in attendance. Susanne Ault of Billboard also reported {{that many of the}} shows sold out in one day. The tour had a total gross of $40.5million. It became the tenth highest-grossing tour of the year in North America, as well as the second highest grossing tour by a solo artist, only behind Tina Turner's Twenty Four Seven Tour. Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel analyzed Spears to emulate [...] "a lot of Janet Jackson's old concert act and cleaned it up for a younger audience", also noting choreography resembling [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] precision." ...|$|E

Bow reminisced: [...] "He had not found {{exactly what he wanted}} and finally somebody suggested me to him. When I came into his office <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> came over his face and he looked just tickled to death." [...] Lloyd told the press, [...] "Bow is the personification of the ideal aristocratic flapper, mischievous, pretty, aggressive, quick-tempered and deeply sentimental." [...] It was released on January 4, 1924.|$|E
2500|$|The {{story begins}} with the Cassini Saturn {{spacecraft}} releasing the Huygens Titan probe. The scene is then transposed to Earth, where a 12-year-old girl, Jeana (Voiced by Abigail Breslin), places a sun filter over a telescope to view sun spots. She asks her mentor, a Professor [...] "Why is the Sun so bright?" [...] This leads the professor to launch into a scientific explanation about fusion. The little girl laughs, having played this trick on her mentor many times, she says [...] "No I meant bright, bright like happy. In most drawings the sun has <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile.</b> Is he good, like {{the man in the}} moon." [...] Knowing this means she wants a story, the mentor begins to spin a tale, but as a mentor, this one, while entertaining, is also educational.|$|E

2500|$|Actor Nick Berry {{was cast}} to play Wicksy with minimal delay. Smith has {{described}} his casting {{as one of}} the fastest on record. [...] Berry auditioned in front of the soap's creators, Smith and Tony Holland, and was offered the part immediately. Berry was whisked into costume and make-up and given a new haircut, which Berry claimed was because the producers wanted to smarten his appearance up. Berry was already a fan of the soap {{at the time of his}} casting. He has told interviewer Dan Abramson, [...] "I auditioned on a Wednesday and then on Friday I arrived in Albert Square and began shooting my first scenes with Dirty Den, whom I had enjoyed watching on the box for some time. For my first few episodes, I walked around with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> on my face, grinning at everybody. It was funny." ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{his first}} {{appearance}} until his death five years later, Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf became a popular character on the show. Never afraid to express himself, Hank would come across completely unguarded. In terms of being belligerent, Hank's manager Doug Z. Goodstein explained that this tended to only occur when Hank was really drunk and people would heckle him. [...] He described Hank [...] "as a relatively soft-spoken polite guy who quite often had <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> on his face." [...] Behind Hank's public persona, an underlying [...] "good nature" [...] tended to shine through, which fans seemed to recognize. [...] During the first few years, Hank would take the bus from Boston each month {{as soon as he}} got his SSI disability check. [...] Hank was a member of the show's Wack Pack and soon attracted a large informal fan base.|$|E
2500|$|Selena {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics.

The teenage and adult Selena is played by Lopez in a star-making performance. After her strong work as the passionate lover of Jack Nicholson in the current Blood and Wine, here she creates a completely different performance, as a loyal Quintanilla who does most of her growing up on a tour bus with her dad at the wheel." [...] Entertainment Weekly believed Lopez perfected Selena's accent while [...] "studying performance footage of the pop sensation" [...] according to Nava. Lopez said [...] "you need to do your homework on this gig" [...] because Selena was [...] "fresh in the public's mind".|$|E
500|$|During the Drowned World Tour of 2001, Madonna {{was asked}} whether she had really sent the book for Morton's well-being. She replied sarcastically: [...] "Why yes, I always send bibles and {{philosophy}} books to my biographers." [...] Motioning to her then husband Guy Ritchie she continued, [...] "Just ask my husband, he'll tell you that my greatest concern these days is not this fucking tour, or him or even our kids, why, it's Andrew Morton's spiritual enlightment of course." [...] Her publicist Liz Rosenberg released a statement that [...] "None of this [...] is true. I never saw a groom walk down an aisle with <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>smile</b> than Guy Ritchie," [...] adding that Morton's claims were a retread of [...] "tired old gossip. It's same old, same old." [...] Morton remained unabashed, saying that he wrote the book because of {{his interest in the}} star, not least because she has made a [...] "difference" [...] to pop culture and modern culture. He added: ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1994, {{a puppet}} of Tony Blair made his appearance. He was {{originally}} {{a public school}} boy, wearing grey shorts, blazer and cap. His catchphrase was [...] "IM THE LEADER" [...] in reference to his attempt to lead the Labour Party. When Blair did become Labour leader, the puppet changed and he was portrayed with his grin replaced with <b>an</b> even <b>bigger</b> <b>smile</b> if he said something of importance. The deputy leader, John Prescott, was portrayed as a fat bumbling assistant, along with a squeaky voiced Robin Cook, and an enormous glasses-wearing Jack Straw.|$|R

Occasionally he saw <b>a</b> brown <b>big</b> hairy face {{floating}} in over this lighted horizon, to smile kindly and go away again. Others came with shaggy beards. He heard a cheery tenor voice which he recognized, and then another face, <b>a</b> <b>big</b> brown <b>smiling</b> face; very lovely it looked now to him-almost as lovely as his wife's, which floated in from the other side.|$|R

5000|$|In Japan, {{songs that}} {{describe}} {{how to draw}} animals and/or favorite characters are called [...] "Ekaki Uta". These songs are supposed to help children remember how to draw something by incorporating drawing directions into the lyrics. (E.g., first you draw a circle, then you dot the eyes, draw <b>a</b> great <b>big</b> <b>smile,</b> etc....) If they memorize the song, which is easy to do because it is usually a catchy melody, effectively they have remembered how to draw what the song describes. Children at play often sing these songs as they doodle on paper or in playground sand. Drawing songs exist for many children's cartoon characters in Japan, for example Sgt. Frog, Doraemon, and Kirby of the Stars.|$|R

When Hives explained that he had known Henry Royce himself, had worked for him, and had absorbed from him his passion for engineering excellence Rickover’s mood an attitude started to improve. Hives {{spent much of the}} lunch telling a captivated Rickover about Royce’s obsession with achieving perfection. He then took Rickover on a personal tour of the works, not in a Rolls-Royce or Bentley but in a very modest Hillman.…when Hives returned after showing Rickover around… the Admiral was a changed man, subdued, pleasant, cooperative, uncritical, and no further put-downs or denigrations of British engineering escaped his lips...

5000|$|The {{critical}} {{reception of}} the episode was positive to mixed. Dan Martin of The Guardian praised the writing and acting, but criticised the more minor role of the Doctor in the episode, and the length, which did not do the mythology justice. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times called it [...] "a superb, witty, heart-warming encounter between two heroes," [...] praising Gatiss' [...] "elegant, hugely witty script that delivers a coherent plot," [...] and calling the Doctor and Robin Hood [...] "one of the funniest double acts ever seen in Doctor Who." [...] Michael Hogan of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode five stars out of five. He said this was the episode in which [...] "Capaldi truly came into his own as The Doctor," [...] noting his channeling of Malcolm Tucker in his Doctor made for some truly comedic moments. Simon Brew of Den of Geek commended the lightness of the episode, in contrast to Capaldi's opening two episodes and called it [...] "hugely entertaining," [...] and [...] "wonderfully silly." [...] He writes that [...] "Robot of Sherwood" [...] is [...] "the kind of Doctor Who you reach for when you've got a spare hour, and {{just want to get}} <b>a</b> great <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> on your face." ...|$|R
