5|$|The {{symptoms}} of AML {{are caused by}} replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells, which causes a drop in red blood cells, platelets, and normal white blood cells. These symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, easy bruising <b>and</b> <b>bleeding,</b> and increased risk of infection. Several risk factors and chromosomal abnormalities have been identified, but the specific cause is not clear. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: For the {{development}} of optimal perfusion pro-cesses {{the effect of the}} feed <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> rate on cell growth in a perfusion bioreactor was studied. The viable-cell den-sity, viability, growth, death, and lysis rate and cell-cycle distribution of a hybridoma cell line producing an IgG 1 were studied over a range of specific feed <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> rates. It was found that the feed <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> rates applied in the different cultures could be divided into two regions based on the viable-cell density and cell-cycle distribution. The cultures in the first region, low feed rates (0. 5 and 1. 0 d 1) combined with low bleed rates (0. 05 and 0. 10 d 1), were nutrient-limited, as an increase in the feed rate resulted in an increase in the viable-cell density. The cultures in the second region, high feed <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> rates, were nonnutrient-limited. In this region the viable-cell density decrease...|$|R

Swannell played in 15 games, including all four Test Matches, three against Australia {{and the final}} Test against New Zealand. In the third Test, Swannell scored his first and only international points, a try against Australia in Sydney. The British Isles were victorious over the Australians, but lost the New Zealand match, {{this was the first}} international game that Swannell had been on the losing side.

5|$|The game {{features}} no heads-up display. Instead, {{condition of}} the player character is relayed through the sound cues of his heartbeat and breathing, which become more pronounced when wounded, and color draining from the screen with loss of blood and strength. Specific injuries are also indicated visually and aurally: for example, a broken leg causes the character to limp while making appropriate noises, while a broken arm makes aiming more difficult. The health system {{was designed as a}} more realistic take on character injury than other games of its genre in that different wounds, including poisoning <b>and</b> <b>bleeding,</b> require different remedies, such as a splint for a broken leg. The inventory screen shows the character's injuries (displayed on his character model) and all carried items.|$|E

5|$|Healthy {{pelicans}} {{can usually}} {{cope with their}} lice, but sick birds may carry hundreds of individuals, which hastens their demise. The pouch louse Piagetiella peralis, which occurs in the pouch and therefore cannot be removed by preening, is usually not a serious problem, even when present in such numbers that it covers the whole interior of the pouch, but sometimes inflammation <b>and</b> <b>bleeding</b> may harm the host. The brown pelican has a similarly extensive range of parasites. The nematodes Contracaecum multipapillatum and C. mexicanum and the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae have caused illness and mortality in the Puerto Rican population, possibly endangering the pelican on this island. In May 2012, hundreds of Peruvian pelicans {{were reported to have}} perished in Peru from a combination of starvation and roundworm infestation.|$|E
5|$|In 15–20 {{percent of}} cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, no aneurysm is detected on the first angiogram. About half of these are attributed to non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage, in which the blood {{is limited to the}} subarachnoid spaces around the midbrain (i.e. mesencephalon). In these, the origin of the blood is uncertain. The remainder are due to other disorders affecting the blood vessels (such as cerebral arteriovenous malformations), disorders of the blood vessels in the spinal cord, <b>and</b> <b>bleeding</b> into various tumors. Cocaine abuse and sickle cell anemia (usually in children) and, rarely, anticoagulant therapy, problems with blood clotting and pituitary apoplexy can also result in SAH. Dissection of the vertebral artery, usually caused by trauma, can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage if the dissection involves the part of the vessel inside the skull.|$|E
5|$|The Resistance use {{the nuclear}} codes and the Spindly Torque {{to mount an}} assault on Deathshead's compound. Rescuing the {{captured}} resistance prisoners and evacuating them, Blazkowicz {{makes it to the}} top of the tower, struggling to Deathshead's workshop. Inside, Deathshead greets Blazkowicz, revealing to him that he possesses the brain of the soldier that Blazkowicz chose to die, and puts it in a robot. The robot comes alive and assaults Blazkowicz, who defeats it and puts his friend to rest by destroying the brain. Commandeering a larger robot mecha, Deathshead then attacks Blazkowicz, who gets the upper hand and destroys the robot, dragging Deathshead out of it. He repeatedly stabs Deathshead, who pulls out a grenade which explodes, killing Deathshead and mauling Blazkowicz. As a gravely wounded Blazkowicz crawls towards a window, he mentally recites The New Colossus as he watches the Resistance survivors boarding a helicopter, alongside Anya and Set. Seeing that they have reached safety, <b>and</b> <b>bleeding</b> heavily from his injuries, Blazkowicz orders the Resistance to fire the nuclear cannon. After the credits, a helicopter is heard approaching.|$|E
40|$|For the {{development}} of optimal perfusion processes, insight into the effect of feed <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> rate on cell growth, productivity, and metabolism is essential. In the here presented study {{the effect of the}} feed <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> rate on cell metabolism was investigated using metabolic flux analysis. Under all tested feed <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> rates the biomass concentration as calculated from the nitrogen balance (biomass-nitrogen) increased linearly with an increase in feed rate, as would be expected. However, {{depending on the size of}} the feed <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> rate, this increase was attained in two different ways. At low feed <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> rates (Region I) the increase was obtained through an increase in viable-cell concentration, while the cellular-nitrogen content remained constant. At high feed <b>and</b> <b>bleed</b> rates (Region II) the increase was attained through an increase in cellular-nitrogen content, while the cell concentration remained constant. Per gram biomass-nitrogen, the specific consumption and production rates of the majority of the nutrients and products were identical in both regions, as were most of the fluxes. The major difference between the two regions was an increased flux from pyruvate to lactate and a decreased flux of pyruvate toward citrate in region II. The decreased in-flux at the level of citrate can either be balanced by a decreased out-flux toward lipid biosynthesis leading to a lower fraction of lipids in the cell, by a decreased out-flux toward the citric acid cycle resulting in a decreased energy generation, or by a combination of these. Finally, the specific productivity increases less than the nitrogen content per cell in region II, which implies that for obtaining maximum production rates it is important to increase the cell density and not only the biomass density...|$|R

5|$|The work {{performed}} by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys {{were forced to}} work without gloves {{so that they could}} better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut <b>and</b> <b>bleeding.</b> Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts. Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only {{at the end of the}} working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.|$|E
5|$|Thus locked together, both captains ordered {{their ships}} to pour fire into the other. So closely aligned were they that many cannon on both ships {{could not be}} run out, and instead had to be fired from inside the ships. The heat from this {{sustained}} bombardment was so intense that the wood began to blacken and burn as heavy roundshot smashed gaping holes in the sides of each ship: during the combat the ragged holes torn {{in the side of}} Hercule were so extensive that the planking between the gunports was torn away, leaving wide scars along the ship's sides. Casualties were heavy on both sides: 20 minutes after the action began a musket ball struck Hood in the thigh, severing his femoral artery. Fatally wounded <b>and</b> <b>bleeding</b> profusely, Hood was carried below and command passed to Lieutenant William Butterfield. The French casualties were significantly higher than the British, a result of the much higher rate of fire achieved by Hood's well-trained crew.|$|E
5|$|William Foster and William Eddy, both {{survivors}} of the snowshoe party, started from Bear Valley to intercept Reed, taking with them a man named John Stark. After one day, they met Reed helping his children, all frostbitten <b>and</b> <b>bleeding</b> but alive. Desperate to rescue their own children, Foster and Eddy persuaded four men, with pleading and money, to return to Truckee Lake with them. Halfway there they found the crudely mutilated and eaten remains of two children and Mrs. Graves, with one-year-old Elizabeth Graves crying beside her mother's body. Eleven survivors were huddled around a fire that had sunk into a pit. The relief party split, with Foster, Eddy, and two others headed toward Truckee Lake. Two rescuers, hoping to save the healthiest, each took a child and left. John Stark refused to leave the others. Stark picked up two children and all the provisions, and assisted the nine remaining Breens and Graveses to Bear Valley.|$|E
