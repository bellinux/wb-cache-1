He later recalled the long periods of time he spent in the area: [...] "I recalled the places I had seen with my mother when I was a little boy—the mountaintop Buddhist retreats.

Defending his support of a military charter school in Oakland, Brown once told KQED reporter Stephen Talbot, [...] "I believe that had I been sent to the military academy, <b>as</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and father threatened, I would have been president a long time ago." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 1995 memoir Dreams from My Father, Barack Obama {{mentioned}} Frank, {{a friend}} in Hawaii of his maternal grandfather Stanley Dunham; Obama later identified the man as Davis. Obama said Davis recounted that he and Stanley Dunham had grown up 50 miles apart in Kansas, near Wichita, although they did not meet until living in Hawaii. Davis described the way Kansas race relations were back then, including Jim Crow restrictions, and his belief {{that there had been}} little progress since then. As Obama remembered, [...] "It made me smile, thinking back on Frank and his old Black Power, dashiki self. In some ways he was as incurable <b>as</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> as certain in his faith, living in the same sixties time warp that Hawaii had created." [...] Obama also remembered Frank Davis later in life after taking a job in South Chicago as a community organizer. One day Obama visited areas where Davis had lived, writing, [...] "I imagined Frank in a baggy suit and wide lapels, {{standing in front of the}} old Regal Theatre, waiting to see Duke or Ella emerge from a gig." ...|$|E
