5|$|Goldfaden {{was both}} a {{theoretician}} and a practitioner of theater. That {{he was in no}} small measure a theoretician – for example, he was interested almost from the start in having set design seriously support the themes of his plays – relates to a key property of Yiddish theater {{at the time of its}} birth: in general, writes Bercovici, theory ran ahead of practice. Much of the Jewish community, Goldfaden included, were already familiar with contemporary theater in other languages. The initial itinerary of Goldfaden's company – Iaşi, Botoşani, Galaţi, Brăila, Bucharest – could <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> been the itinerary of a Romanian-language troupe. Yiddish theater may have been seen from the outset as an expression of a Jewish national character, but the theatrical values of Goldfaden's company were in many ways those of a good Romanian theater of the time. Also, Yiddish was a German dialect which became a well-known language even among non-Jews in Moldavia (and Transylvania), an important language of commerce; the fact that one of the first to write about Yiddish theater was Romania's national poet, Mihai Eminescu, is testimony that interest in Yiddish theater went beyond the Jewish community.|$|E
25|$|Jesus {{does not}} resist or {{contend with the}} world because he doesn't {{recognize}} the importance of the world. His life is its own kingdom of God at every moment. Early Christians used Semitic concepts to express his teaching, but his antirealism could just <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> been a characteristic of Taoism or Hinduism.|$|E
25|$|Marlovians {{argue that}} if Frizer, Poley and Skeres could lie about what happened, they could just <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> been lying about the {{identity}} of the corpse itself. In other words, that although they claimed it was Marlowe's—and {{as far as we know}} they were the only ones there in a position to identify him—it was in fact someone else's body that the jury was called upon to examine.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, Gruenwald, Steven Grant, and Bill Mantlo co-wrote Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions, {{the first}} limited series {{published}} by Marvel Comics. As a writer, Gruenwald {{is best known}} for creating the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe and his ten-year stint as the writer of Captain America (from 1985 to 1995) – during which he contributed several notable characters such as Crossbones, Diamondback and U.S. Agent. He made a deliberate effort to create villains who would be specific to Captain America, as opposed to generic foes who could <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> been introduced in another comic. At one point Gruenwald owned a replica of Captain America's shield – the same shield now owned by Stephen Colbert.|$|E
500|$|Ephraim Lytle, {{assistant}} professor of Hellenistic history at the University of Toronto, commented: [...] "Ephialtes, who betrays the Greeks, is likewise changed from a local Malian of sound body into a Spartan outcast, a grotesquely disfigured troll who by Spartan custom should have been left exposed as an infant to die. Leonidas points out that his hunched back means Ephialtes cannot lift his shield high enough {{to fight in the}} phalanx. This is a transparent defence of Spartan eugenics, and convenient given that infanticide could <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> been precipitated by an ill-omened birthmark." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Action" [...] {{refers to}} {{the speed with which}} the rod returns to its neutral position. An action may be slow, medium, fast, or {{anything}} in between (e.g. medium-fast). Contrary to how it is often presented, action does not refer to the bending curve. A rod with fast action can <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> a progressive bending curve (from tip to butt) as a top only bending curve. The action can be influenced by the tapering of a rod, the length and the materials used for the blank. Typically a rod which uses a glass fibre composite blank is slower than a rod which uses a carbon fibre composite blank.|$|E
2500|$|PC Formats Matt Avery {{summarized}} Tropico 2 as [...] "short-lived {{fun with}} information overload {{in place of}} interaction." [...] Although he remarked that [...] "statisticians will have a field day" [...] with the game's detailed economics, he disliked Tropico 2s lack of direct control over units, and found the overall product [...] "rather limited." [...] Writing for PC Gamer US, Stephen Poole criticized the game's combination of piracy and management gameplay, which he found awkward, unrealistic and unsatisfying. He also argued that the game's musical style is incongruous with its setting. Poole concluded that Tropico 2s theme is [...] "barely a skin-deep covering on a sim that could just <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> been made about the ACME Widget Factory." ...|$|E

Although the town is officially known as [...] "Stanley", one frequently hears it still referred to as [...] "Port Stanley", especially in British reports about the Falklands War. This {{is in line with}} various other settlements around the islands, e.g. Port Howard and Port Stephens. However, [...] "Stanley" [...] without the [...] "Port" [...] prefix was established long before the war, and on 2 August 1956, the Officer Administering the Government of the Falkland Islands reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in London as follows: ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{publications}} {{have published}} lists {{of what they}} deem the best Joyce Carol Oates books, designed to help introduce readers to the author's daunting oeuvre. In a 2003 article entitled [...] "Joyce Carol Oates for dummies", The Rocky Mountain News recommended starting with her early short stories and the novels A Garden of Earthly Delights (1967), them (1969), Wonderland (1971), Black Water (1992), and Blonde (2000). In 2006, The Times listed them, On Boxing (in collaboration with photographer John Ranard) (1987), Black Water, and [...] (2006) as [...] "The Pick of Joyce Carol Oates". In 2007, Entertainment Weekly listed its Oates favorites as Wonderland, Black Water, Blonde, I'll Take You There (2002), and The Falls (2004). In 2003, Oates herself said that she thinks she will be remembered for, and would most want a first-time Oates reader to read, them and Blonde, although she [...] "could <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> chosen a number of titles." ...|$|E
2500|$|After O'Bannon {{handed him}} a copy of Giger's book Necronomicon, Scott {{immediately}} saw the potential for Giger's designs, and chose Necronom IV, a print Giger completed in 1976, {{as the basis for}} the Alien's design, citing its beauty and strong sexual overtones. That the creature could just <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> been male or female was also a strong factor in the decision to use it. [...] "It could just as easily fuck you before it killed you," [...] said line producer Ivor Powell, [...] " [...] made it all the more disconcerting." [...] Fox studios were initially wary of allowing Giger onto the project, saying that his works would be too disturbing for audiences, but eventually relented. Giger initially offered to completely design the Alien from scratch, but Scott mandated that he base his work on Necronom IV, saying that to start over from the beginning would be too time-consuming. Giger signed on to design the adult, egg and chest-burster forms, but ultimately also designed the alien planetoid LV-426 and the Space Jockey alien vessel.|$|E

50|$|Polish cryptanalysts first {{were reading}} German Enigma ciphers in 1932, {{although}} the commercial version {{may have been}} broken by the British cryptanalyst, Dilwyn Knox, in the 1920s. Poland gave critical information to the French and British in 1939, and production British cryptanalysis was well underway in 1940. The Enigma, with German military enhancements, was quite powerful for a mechanical encryption device, and it might not <b>have</b> been broken <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>had</b> the Germans been more careful about operating procedures. Throughout the war, Germany introduced enhancements, but never realized the British were reading the traffic almost {{as fast as the}} Germans.|$|R
