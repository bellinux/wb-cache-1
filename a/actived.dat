50|$|The {{game has}} been {{expanded}} {{with a number}} of episodes, adding a few dozen new levels per episode as well as new gameplay mechanics. In the game's first major expansion, the game added a separate set of levels in the Dreamworld, not accessible any more. While levels had the same goals, the players had to balance matches of candies of two randomly selected colors as to disrupt the sleeping Odus the Owl; if they did, the level was considered lost and the player had to try again. If they collected enough matched candies to fill a meter, the player <b>actived</b> the Moon Struck power: the board was cleared of all candies of those two colors, and the player gained a few turns of additional matches without having to balance colors. After this, Odus returned to sleeping and two new colors were randomly selected for the balance. This continued until the player completed the level or ran out of turns as in the main game. Dreamworld levels used a different set of lives from the main game, allowing the player to switch back and forth between these modes.|$|E

In the simulation, Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential is used for represent the fluid-fluid interaction, and the 10 - 4 - 3 potential is used for represent the interaction between fluid molecules and a slit carbon wall. Firstly, the adsorption isotherms of methane in <b>actived</b> carbon pores and local density profiles of methane in slit pore are obtained. Then, the interaction energy of methane in slit carbon pores with nine different pore sizes is obtained.

Adsorption refrigeration is considered as green refrigeration technology, which is driven by low grade heat source. Intensified efforts were promoted to improve the adsorption chiller performance in recent years. Two stages with different adsorbents adsorption chiller working principle and test were proposed in this paper. The novel adsorption chiller contains 4 pieces adsorbers and evaporator and condenser. Zeolite and <b>actived</b> carbon were applied for adsorbents in the two-stage cycle and two adsorbers were packed with zeolite and other adsorbers with <b>actived</b> carbon. The two-stage cycle can be operated effectively with 50 °C, even with 45 °C. Coefficient of performance (COP) and volumetric cooling power (VCP) of two-stage adsorption chiller with different operation conditions were investigated in this paper. The results showed that VCP increases firstly and then decreases with increasing the elapsed time and the maximum of VCP with driving heat source temperature of 50 °C and cooling water temperature of 30 °C and chilled water temperature of 15 °C was about 0. 2 kW/L.

Process of the synthesis involved dry sludge (50 g) as precursor, concentrated sodium silicate solution SiO 2 24. 5 % and Na 2 O 7. 5 % (50 mL) as template source, 1 M HCl solution (50 mL) as polimering agent, carbonization condition at 600 °C 3 h under nitrogen gas flow, activation conditions with NaOH 50 % and various temperatures (400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 °C), and demineralizatin conditions with 0. 1 M HCl solution for 4 h and 125 rpm.

The prior information of <b>active</b> contour with global translation preference {{can be interpreted as}} the velocity field along the evolving contour with equivalency preference.
