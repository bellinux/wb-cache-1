5|$|A {{tropical}} depression developed well {{east of the}} Lesser Antilles on August29. Initially drifting westward, the storm gradually intensified and became a tropical storm early the next day. By August31, the system strengthened into a Category1 hurricane. The next day, the hurricane entered the Caribbean Sea, passing the island of Dominica as a Category2 hurricane. Continuing to intensify, the storm further intensified into a Category3 hurricane on September2 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Category4 the following day. Around 18:00UTC on September3, the hurricane peaked with winds of 155mph (250km/h), observed by a ship. Simultaneously, the storm made landfall near Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|Hayes, an {{attorney}} in Ohio, was city solicitor of Cincinnati from 1858 to 1861. When the Civil War began, he left a fledgling political career to join the Union Army as an officer. Hayes was wounded five times, most seriously at the Battle of South Mountain. He earned a reputation for bravery in combat and was promoted {{to the rank of}} brevet major general. After the war, he served in the Congress from 1865 to 1867 as a Republican. Hayes left Congress to run for Governor of Ohio and was elected to two consecutive terms, from 1868 to 1872, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> third term, from 1876 to 1877.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{the trail}} was rerouted through Pelly Crossing and a {{checkpoint}} was added there, and the Lake Laberge stretch {{was replaced by}} a route through Braeburn and along the Dawson-Whitehorse Overland Trail. In 1997, mushers were routed through the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project and to the Alaska town of North Pole before continuing on to Fairbanks. The North Pole loop was removed before the 2009 race, and mushers were directed through Two Rivers instead. Starting in the 2010 race, the Mile 101 location was upgraded from a dog drop to a full-fledged checkpoint. In the past several races, the Two Rivers checkpoint has changed locations annually: from a lodge to a campground, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> gravel pit in 2011.|$|E

5|$|For three days, {{beginning}} on September 26, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration deployed planes into the hurricane {{as part of}} Project Stormfury, the fourth hurricane {{to be a part}} of the weather control experiment. The plane dropped silver iodide into the center of the hurricane, although there was no effect due to Ginger's large eye and diffuse nature; this was the last seeding done by the project. By September 28, Ginger was moving northwestward toward North Carolina and was steadily intensifying. At around 06:00 UTC the next day, the hurricane reached a secondary peak intensity of 105 mph (165 km/h), which it maintained for about 18 hours. Afterward, Ginger slowly weakened, and late on September 30 it made landfall near Morehead City, North Carolina, with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). It quickly deteriorated over land, weakening first to a tropical storm <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression by late on October 1. Ginger turned to the north, entered southern Virginia, and later turned to the east. On October 3, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while crossing Hampton Roads into the Atlantic Ocean. The remnants of Ginger continued east-southeastward until being absorbed by a cold front on October 5.|$|E

5|$|M-63 {{originally}} {{ran from}} Peacock in Lake County west through Luther to M-13 (later US131) in Osceola County on July 1, 1919. This highway was extended in 1930 along US131 to Tustin <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> terminus with M-66 in Marion. At the same time, M-37 was extended north from Baldwin to meet M-63 east of Peacock. This eastern extension was truncated in 1932 {{when it was}} redesignated as part of M-61. A short connector roadway, M-179, was designated in 1935 between M-63 and US131, forming a small triangle of highways. The western end was shortened in 1939 so that M-63 ended at M-37 instead of continuing west to Peacock. The M-179 designation was decommissioned in 1959 or 1960, removing that short highway from the state trunkline highway system. M-63 was decommissioned in 1961 when the roadway was transferred back to local control.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{considered}} {{returning to}} Columbia City after leaving office, but instead bought {{a home and}} opened a law practice in Indianapolis, where he believed there would be better business opportunities. Harding nominated him {{to serve on the}} Lincoln Memorial Commission in 1921, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more lucrative position on the Federal Coal Commission in 1922; Marshall resigned from both commissions in 1923. He spent over a year writing books on the law and his Recollections, a humorous memoir. The latter book was completed in May 1925 and subsequent historians have noted it as unusual, even for its time, for not disclosing any secrets or attacking any of Marshall's enemies. Marshall remained a popular public speaker, and continued to travel to give speeches. The last he delivered was to high school students in the town of his birth.|$|E
5|$|The first railway to Milford Haven {{was with}} the {{completion}} of the South Wales Railway in 1856. Brunel had a vision of connecting London to New York via a railway through Wales <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> commuter port. The initial plan was to terminate the line at Fishguard and to create a ferry service to Ireland, but after a failure to complete Irish rail links the terminus was changed to New Milford, (Neyland), which was completed in April 1856. The first rail link direct to Milford Haven was completed in 1863, which was originally conceived as a plan to create an impressive Milford to Manchester railway. The trains using the line were operated by Great Western Railway who had part funded the original railway. Today the town is served by Milford Haven railway station. The station, and all trains serving it, are operated by Arriva Trains Wales on the West Wales Line. It is the terminus, and from here, trains depart every two hours to Manchester Piccadilly via Carmarthen, Swansea, and Cardiff Central.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} steadily strengthened as {{it moved}} towards the northwest around the western periphery of the Azores High on September 25. Encountering the anticyclone situated off of the Mid-Atlantic states, Helene began to curve slightly towards the west. The lack of strong steering currents in the storm's vicinity caused the hurricane to move very slowly throughout the day, giving the hurricane time to significantly intensify. By 0000 UTC on September 26, Helene strengthened to {{the equivalent of a}} modern-day Category 2 hurricane, with a minimum pressure of 980 mbar (hPa; 28.94 inHg). Moving slowly towards The Carolinas, the hurricane rapidly intensified. A recon flight reported a minimum pressure of 948 mbar (hPa; 28.00 inHg), a drop of 40 mbar (hPa; 1.18 inHg) from the previous day. As the hurricane neared the coast, its eye became apparent on coastal long-range WSR-57 weather radar images. By 1800 UTC on September 26, Helene strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Category 4 hurricane the following day. The major hurricane continued to strengthen before reaching its peak intensity on September 27 with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). However, Helene's lowest barometric pressure of 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46 inHg) was recorded earlier during the day. Still moving northwestward due to the influence of the Azores High, the hurricane came within 10 mi (15 km) of the US East Coast before recurving towards the northeast out to sea.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{turned down}} a new {{contract}} with Ebbsfleet to sign for newly promoted League Two club Stevenage on a two-year contract for a compensation fee on 18 May 2010. He made his Stevenage debut in the club's 3–1 home victory against Stockport, playing 78 minutes of the match. The following week, he started against Aldershot Town, but was taken off after 38 minutes after struggling with injury. Charles returned to the starting eleven on 18 September 2010, starting in a 0–0 draw against Torquay United, Stevenage's first clean sheet of 2010–11. He scored his first goal for the club in Stevenage's 1–1 draw with Milton Keynes Dons in an FA Cup first round replay in November 2010. Charles' goal came in the fifth minute of stoppage time, taking the match to extra time <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> penalty shoot-out, which Stevenage won 7–6. Charles received a straight red card for a professional foul on John Johnson in Stevenage's 1–0 home loss to Northampton Town on 11 December 2010, just ten minutes after coming on as a substitute. He scored his second goal for Stevenage in the club's fourth round FA Cup tie against Championship team Reading, cutting inside and curling the ball past the outstretched arm of Adam Federici to restore parity in a match that Stevenage went on to lose 2–1. Charles scored his first league goal of 2010–11 with a shot from 12yards in Stevenage's 2–1 home win against Bradford City on 2 April 2011. He provided the assist for Joel Byrom's goal after flicking a right-wing cross in Stevenage's 2–0 play-off victory over Accrington Stanley, a match in which he also hit the crossbar with a strike from 30yards out. Charles started upfront for Stevenage in the 2011 League Two play-off Final, played at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011. Charles' pass through to John Mousinho resulted in the only goal of the match, as a 1–0 victory over Torquay United meant Stevenage were promoted to League One. He played 33 matches for Stevenage during 2010–11, scoring four goals.|$|E
