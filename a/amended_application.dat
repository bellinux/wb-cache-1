50|$|The {{area has}} {{featured}} {{recently in the}} national news on account of plans to develop open cast coal mining adjacent to the village. A plan submitted in 2008 led to speculation in the local media that property values would drop by 40% as a result. The plan submitted by HM Project Developments Ltd in November 2010 was to extract approximately 140,000 tonnes of coal; with the nearest housing to the mining extraction being just under 60 metres away. In May 2012 the UK government Planning Inspector Clive Sproule, held an inquiry into this proposal, after the County Council had rejected applications to develop the site.The inquiry sat for nine days between 15-31 May. On 7 August the Planning Inspector published his decision. The appeal by HM Project Developments Ltd against {{the decision of the}} Northumberland County Council was allowed provided a schedule of conditions could be met. A notable person absent from the inquiry was Dr Dick van Steenis, a retired GP, whose presence at other inquiries to give evidence of the link between open cast mining and reduced life expectation and other health problems,had previously led to the blocking of many open-cast mines.Hartleyburn Parish Council then sought a judicial review of the Planning Inspector's decision.Hartleyburn Parish Council's challenge to the Inspector's decision was dismissed by Judge Brehens sitting in the High Court in Leeds.Following the Planning Inspector's decision, an <b>amended</b> <b>application</b> was submitted by HM Project Developments Ltd to Northumberland County Council. This application was recommended for acceptance by the County Council Planning Case Officer and was approved by the Planning and Environment Committee of the County Council on 7 January 2014.

40|$|In 1990 {{the former}} Federal Health Office (Bundesgesundheitsamt) and the Federal Environmental Agency (Umweltbundesamt) jointly {{elaborated}} {{a catalogue of}} test requirements necessary for assessing the impact of wood preservatives on man and environment. Based on several years of experience, a revision was deemed necessary. Complying with {{the provisions of the}} Directive 98 / 8 /EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market, which have to be transposed into national laws, the regulatory bodies BAM, BgVV and UBA, in cooperation with industry and academia (IUCT), developed an <b>amended</b> <b>application</b> form for wood preservatives. The provisions laid down there include different sets of data for wood preservatives, depending on the intended uses/hazard classes, e. g. physico-chemical and ecotoxicological properties, data on exposure, fate and behaviour in the environment and on waste management. The tests should be conducted according to standardized test protocols. Next to the list of data requirements explanations and justifications are given on why the data are needed and how they contribute to the risk assessment. Furthermore, recommendations are given on which test guidelines should preferably be followed to generate the data. In addition, annex I includes a proposal for a test guideline on how to screen leachates from preservative-treated wood surfaces for their ecotoxic potential to aquatic organisms. (orig.)

40|$|The Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) Project is a 25 MW (net) {{powerplant}} {{and associated}} geothermal well field {{proposed for the}} Puna District of the Island of Hawaii. The project, located in the Kapoho section of the Kilauea Lower East Rift Geothermal Resources Subzone, will sell the generated electricity to the Hawaii Electric Light Company (HELCO) for the Island of Hawaii. Since the proposed project is located within {{an area where the}} designated Geothermal Resources Subzone underlies an agricultural state land use district, the project requires a Geothermal Resource Permit from the County of Hawaii. The PGV Project is consistent with the stated objectives of providing energy self-sufficiency and diversifying Hawaii's economic base. The project will develop a new alternate energy source as well as provide additional information {{about the nature of the}} geothermal resource. These objectives are included in Hawaii's State Plan, the State Energy Functional Plan, and the County of Hawaii General Plan. On December 10, 1986, Thermal Power Company (TPC), as then operator of the Puna Geothermal Venture partnership, submitted anapplication to the Hawaii County Planning Department (HCPD) for a Geothermal Resource Permit (GRP) for the PGV Project. TPC also requested that the HCPD be the accepting agency for an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that TPC would voluntarily prepare and submit for the PGV Project. Although the HCPD determined that there were no clear requirements for preparation of an EIS, the HCPD agreed to act as accepting agency for the EIS and deferred acceptance of the PGV Project GRP application until after acceptance of the ElS. The Final ElS for the PGV Project was accepted on December 28, 1987, although the Hawaii County Planning Director again noted that the PGV Project did not require the filing of an ElS. However, further processing of the GRP application has not occurred because the entire interest inthe PGV partnership was purchased during the first half of 1988 by AMOR VI Corporation and AMOR VIII Corporation (AMOR Corporations), two wholly-owned subsidiaries of Ormat Energy Systems, Inc. of Sparks, Nevada. Since the purchase, PGV has reviewed the previous design of the PGV Project to determine if it remains entirely appropriate. As a result of this design review, PGV has decided to alter several aspects of the previously proposed PGV Project design to optimize production operations and further reduce the potential for environmental impacts. Principal among these proposed changes is the use in the power plant of back-pressure steam turbines, in combination with air-cooled binary cycle turbines, in place ofthe steam turbines and cooling towers proposed by TPC. This currently proposed power plant configuration applies a closed cycle for the geothermal fluid, thus essentially eliminating hydrogen sulfide emissions during normal operations and eliminating the need for cooling towers. Most other environmental impacts from this revised PGV Project will be very similar to those of the previously proposed PGV Project because the revised PGV Project will use the same geothermal resource, the same geothermal wellpads, and the same power plant location as the previously proposed PGV Project. This amendment to the GRP application has been prepared to replace, in its entirety, the GRP application submitted to the Hawaii County Planning Department in December, 1986. For clarity sake, Chapter 2 of this application is a summary description of the revised PGV Project, drawing comparisons with the previously proposed PGV Project, as appropriate. A more detailed description of the revised PGV Project follows in Chapter 3, organized to follow the requirements of Rule 12, Geothermal Resource Permits, of the county of Hawaii Planning Commission Rules of Practice and Procedure. As required by Rule 12, Chapter 3 of this <b>amended</b> <b>application</b> also summarizes the PGV Project potential environmental impacts and mitigation measures. See Appendix A for a list of abbreviations used in this GRP Application...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of different levels of salinity and phosphorus on the growth and yield of berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum), an experiment using a factorial experiment conducted carried out based on completely randomized block design with four levels of salinity (S 1 = 0, 12, S 2 = 2, S 3 = 6 and S 4 = 10 dS/m) and two levels of phosphorus (P 1 = 10 and P 2 = 30 ppm) with four replicates under green house conditions. Different levels of salinity have been provided from NaCl, MgCl 2, Na 2 SO 4 and MgSO 4 with weight proportional respectively 2 : 1 : 1 : 1. The treatments of phosphorus provided from KH 2 PO 4 sources. The traits such as growth indexes (leaf area, plant height and shoot diameter) at three different stages, shoot and root dry matters, root to shoot ratio, total length of root, nutrient elements (N, P, K and Na) in shoot and potassium to sodium ratio in shoot were measured. The salinity was applied using saline water with the above-mentioned electrical conductivities. Generally, by increasing salinity and phosphorus levels, all the measured traits were reduced and increased, respectively. Furthermore, at {{the high level of}} salinity, increased available phosphorus improves clover yield.
