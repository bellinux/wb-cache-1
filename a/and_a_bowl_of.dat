25|$|The {{high value}} which {{was set on}} the Barbara Gilmour cheese {{for the purpose of}} {{roasting}} was very much confined to Ayrshire, where a farl of oat cake or supple scone spread with roasted cheese, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> milk, or whey, or tea, or cold water, made a highly relished and substantial meal, precluding in many families the use of bacon for breakfast.|$|E

500|$|In {{south-east}} Essex, Murrell {{was known}} as [...] "The Devil's Master", a title that he himself used as a self-description. He cultivated an air of mystery about himself by keeping himself largely apart from wider community life, speaking seldom, and traveling largely at night. His house was locally known as a [...] "place to avoid" [...] and those visiting him reportedly often waited for some time outside, plucking {{up the courage to}} enter. Within the cottage, Murrell had drying herbs hanging from his ceiling, and his devices were reported to include a crystal, a mirror, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> water. Other items that Murrell used in his magical practices were [...] a copper charm with which he would allegedly distinguish whether an individual was lying or not, and a [...] "trick" [...] telescope that supposedly enabled him [...] "to see through brick walls". The latter device was examined by an acquaintance of Murrell's, who deemed it to be [...] "a clumsily home-made arrangement of bits of looking-glass, such as might once have been bought at a toy-shop". Murrell possessed a library of books, including works on astrology and astronomy, conjuration, and medical texts. He also wrote a number of personal notebooks containing information on such topics, the last of which survived into at least the 1950s.|$|E

These forms are drawn angularly, not roundly modeled in chiaroscuro. The colors are luscious blue, strident yellow, next to pure black and white.

2500|$|The {{collection}} of tobacco pipes included 15 complete clay pipes, 161 fragmentary pipes, two steatite pipes, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> another. [...] The coloring of the clay pipes is from tan through dark brown to grayish black. [...] Most of the pipes had a polish on them that {{can still be}} seen, despite weathering damage. [...] This polish would completely obscure the paste texture of the pipe. [...] The most common decoration on these pipes was one that resembled rouletting and was probably made by a small stamp. [...] There are many sites in the surrounding area that have pipes {{very similar to the}} ones found at Potomac Creek. [...] Port Tobacco, Maryland, Moyaone, Pamunkey Reservation, and Keyser Farm Site all have similar to identical pipes as Potomac Creek.|$|E

60|$|He was {{viewing the}} kitchen upon the {{occasion}} of an intimate Sunday evening supper {{to which he had}} been yearningly invited by Mrs. Gilson. The maids were all out.
