30|$|The {{exploration}} of energization and radiation in geospace (ERG) project {{was developed to}} understand the fundamental physical processes operating in the Earth’s inner magnetosphere. A summary of the ERG project is given in this special issue by Miyoshi <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018</b> a). A central component of this project is the spacecraft Arase, named after the Arase River near the ISAS launch range, (ERG). Arase was launched on December 20, 2016, {{and it has been}} operating in a highly elliptical orbit with apogee of 6 RE and an inclination of 31 °. A brief history of the spacecraft development and the technical features of the spacecraft system are given by Nakamura <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018).</b> The spacecraft has an innovated mission network system described by Takashima <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018).</b> Arase hosts nine state-of-the-art scientific instruments to make in situ observations of particles and fields. The multiple instruments for electron measurements are introduced by Kazama <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2017), Kasahara <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018</b> a, b), Mitani <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018),</b> and Higashio <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018).</b> The instruments for ion measurements are introduced by Asamura <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018)</b> and Yokota <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2017). The magnetic field measurements are described by Matsuoka <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018),</b> and descriptions of the wave and electric fields are provided by Kasahara <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018</b> a, b), Kasaba <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2017), Kumamoto <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018),</b> Ozaki <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018),</b> and Matsuda <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018).</b> The interactions between particles and waves, a critical aspect of the physics of the inner magnetosphere, are diagnosed with a software-type wave-particle interaction analyzer, introduced by Katoh <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018)</b> and Hikishima <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018).</b> The ERG project includes a ground-based observation network that is summarized by Shiokawa <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2017). Other key aspects of the ERG project are a program of theory, modeling, and integrating studies described by Seki <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018),</b> and a data processing center called the ERG Science Center, described by Miyoshi <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018</b> b). An example of the data analysis tool development is introduced by Keika <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2017). All of these elements together are expected to yield major advancements in our understanding of acceleration, transport, and loss of relativistic electrons in the radiation belts.|$|R

30|$|The {{community}} is currently busy mining and interpreting such a transformative dataset and several demonstration and early scientific results {{have already been}} published. As an incomplete list of possible applications, here we mention the quantification of the lumpiness of the local halo (Koppelman <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018),</b> the kinematics of the Galactic disk (Gaia Collaboration <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018</b> c), the calibration of the RR Lyrae and Cepheids distance scale (Clementini <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018,</b> with implications for the measurement of the Hubble constant, see Riess <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018),</b> the distance and orbits of GCs and dwarf galaxies (Gaia Collaboration <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018</b> b, with implications for the measurement of the Milky Way mass, see Watkins <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018),</b> the detection and characterisation of tidal streams (Malhan <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018)</b> and hypervelocity stars (Boubert <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2018; Marchetti <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2018; Lennon <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2018; Hawkins and Wyse 2018). The quality of DR 2 data is high enough to determine the fine structure of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram of stars in the local neighbourhood and beyond (Gaia Collaboration <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018</b> a), an endeavour which is revealing many surprises for stellar population studies (e.g., see Kilic <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2018; Jao <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2018; El-Badry <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018).</b> As {{for the study of}} the internal kinematics of structures in the Local Group, this has been proved feasible even for individual point sources in M 33, M 31 and the Large Magellanic Cloud (van der Marel <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2018; Vasiliev <b>2018</b> b), paving the way for the characterisation of many other objects, including selected young and old star clusters (Bianchini <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2018; Milone <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2018; Kuhn <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018).</b> Beside the primary interest on Galactic stellar populations and dynamics, Gaia data enable to measure exoplanet sizes (Fulton and Petigura 2018), gravitationally lensed systems (Krone-Martins <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018),</b> and even to test general relativity using positional displacement of Sun and Jovian limb. Moreover, it can also be used to develop alternative astrometric search methods for gravitational waves sources (Moore <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2017).|$|R
30|$|There {{are various}} {{successful}} {{examples of the}} use of graphs in analyzing biological and health-related data. Pan <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018)</b> converted gene expression data to an appropriate graph representation and computed betweenness centrality (a graph-theoretic measure) to find important regulator genes in tumors. Their study is a useful motivation for the current work, which also uses betweenness centrality in a heuristic to find important data points. Dale <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018)</b> employed graph clustering techniques to gene expression data to identify genes potentially related to powdery mildew disease resistance in grapevines. Alves <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018)</b> applied graph clustering and graph theoretic measures (degree distribution, average clustering coefficient, and average short path length) to evaluate the effects of an antibody on chick embryos. The specific application of classification of human traits and diseases in patient networks using graph analysis is conducted for a variety of medical applications including pathological narcissism in (Pierro <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018),</b> dark personality traits in (Marcus <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018),</b> post-traumatic stress disorder in (Akiki <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018),</b> and inflammatory bowel diseases in (Abbas <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018).</b>|$|R

Nye <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018)</b> describe the use and effectiveness of natural language tutorials in algebra. Inventado <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018)</b> discuss the design and use of hints and other help activities to provide instruction in middle school mathematics. Skinner <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018)</b> describe the extension of task analysis needed for STEM activities into perceptual and psychomotor requirements for surgeons training to perform Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Surgery (RALS). Finally, Graesser <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018)</b> discuss the integration of lessons learned from integrating five ITS systems to provide post-secondary school instruction in electronic circuits.|$|R

30|$|Thermal {{method has}} been widely adopted in {{practical}} engineering application (Sheikholeslami <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2017 a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, 2018 a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h). At present, the development of unconventional resources has become a hotspot (Yin <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2017, 2018; Zhang <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2017 a, b, 2018 a, b; Feng <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018</b> a, b, c; Hu <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018</b> a, b, c; Shi <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2014, 2015 a, b, 2018).

Saturated steam is the mixture of steam and water under a certain pressure condition (Arab <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2018; Struchkov and Rogachev 2018), while superheated steam is completely gas phase (Sun <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2017 h, i, j). Superheated steam is obtained by continuous heating of saturated steam (Sun <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018</b> a, b, c, d, e, f, g).|$|R

30|$|There are {{numerous}} approaches available to estimate porosity in the inter-well region such as Cokriging (Doyen 1988; Doyen <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1996), single attribute analysis (Maurya <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018</b> a, b), multi-attribute analysis (Maurya <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018</b> a, b), {{probabilistic neural network}} (Maurya <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018</b> a, b), relationship derived from the well logs (Maurya and Singh 2018 a, b), multilayer feed forward neural network (Leite and Vidal 2011), and fuzzy logic (Kadkhodaie-Ilkhchi <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2009), but the multi-attribute analysis is very simple, {{easy to use and}} has a fast computation process (Doyen 1988).

30|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of the Internet and the popularity of computers, people have entered the era of network information (Zhu L <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018)</b> [1]. In particular, the rapid {{development of the}} World Wide Web {{has led to an}} exponential increase in the amount of online information (Sun W <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018)</b> [2]. The sources of information are very extensive. The largest sources of data are network information sources. In addition to relational databases, distributed databases, etc., they have all achieved considerable development (Shafiee S <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018).</b> [3]. The US Department of Health and Human Services’ Child Management Research Office (OCAR) conducted a survey of children in the USA, and record matching was used to identify each child to obtain more accurate survey results. Since then, the data cleaning field has attracted widespread attention (Q <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018)</b> [4]. The amount of data available is getting larger and larger, but at the same time, some related problems have come one after another. Common problems are data integration problems. Data integration is an important processing step in many areas (DW Upton <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018)</b> [5]. For a large data set, the quality of the relevant parameters such as the quality and accuracy of the data in the integration process is a criterion for judging whether the data integration is excellent (Mekikis P V <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018)</b> [6]. However, there are some mistakes that data cannot avoid during the integration process. Overall, the main reason for the problems in the integration process is that there are no agreed standards among the databases, and the format of the data is not the same, which will affect the data. The integration has caused some obstacles (Aygör D <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018)</b> [7]. Therefore, when entering large amounts of data, there will always be some errors and some inconsistent data (Alomari A <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018)</b> [8].|$|R
30|$|Splice {{intervals}} {{were defined}} onboard, and a continuous composite column made of each splice interval was constructed. The depth scale of this composite column is expressed as “CCSF-D (m)” (Tada <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015 b). The splice intervals were further revised after the cruise {{and the new}} depth scale for U 1424 is called “U 1424 _CCSF-D_Patched_rev 20170308 (m)” (Irino <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018).</b> The difference between the shipboard depth scale (CCSF-D) and the new depth scale is less than 1.5  m throughout the splice (Irino <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018).</b> The new depth scale is employed in this study unless otherwise noted. The thickness of the Quaternary sediment is approximately 90  m based on the shipboard age model (Tada <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015 c) and ~[*] 83  m based on the revised age model described below (Tada <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018).</b> Since this site {{is at the same}} location as Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 794, the sediment sequence was correlated with ODP Site 794 cores (Irino <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018).</b>|$|R
30|$|In this study, we {{used the}} core {{composite}} depth below seafloor (CCSF-D) scale of Irino <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018).</b> The depths in CCSF-D were then converted to ages (ka) following the age model proposed by Sagawa <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2018),</b> which relies upon the oxygen isotope stratigraphy of benthic foraminifer tuned to the LR 04 benthic stack (Lisiecki and Raymo 2005).|$|R

Although {{interestingly}} these are being removed under local anaeasthetic {{and there may be}} a bias towards intervention due to the simplicity of the procedure (Häberli <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018).</b> There is no suggestion of increased failure rate with hardware removal (Bieri <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2017; Ateschrang <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2018).</b>|$|R
