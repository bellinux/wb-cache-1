5|$|In {{developing}} the mythology behind the film, the creators used many inspirations. For instance, several character names are near-anagrams: Elly Kedward (The Blair Witch) is Edward Kelley, a 16th-century mystic, and Rustin Parr, the fictional 1940s child-murderer, {{began as an}} anagram for Rasputin. Viewers <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the Blair Witch is, according to legend, the ghost of Elly Kedward, a woman banished from the Blair Township (latter-day Burkittsville) for witchcraft in 1785. The directors incorporated {{that part of the}} legend, along with allusions to the Salem witch trials and Arthur Miller's 1953 play The Crucible, to play on the themes of injustice done on those who were called witches.|$|E

The account in Genesis relates that, before his death, {{he had his}} brothers swear they would carry his bones out of Egypt to Canaan. He is then {{said to have been}} embalmed then placed in a coffin in Egypt. In Exodus, we <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> Moses fulfilled the pledge by taking Joseph's bones with him when he left Egypt. In Joshua, Joseph’s bones are said to have been brought from Egypt by the Children of Israel and interred in Shechem.The bones of Joseph, which the Children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, were buried in Shechem in a parcel of land Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver (qeśîṭâ)..|$|E

5000|$|Section 10 {{has also}} been held not only to {{guarantee}} the right to see a lawyer, but also a right to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> one may see a lawyer, a right to legal aid, and a right to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> one may seek legal aid. [...] Although the right to counsel itself {{could be found in}} the 1960 Canadian Bill of Rights, the right to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> one may see counsel is new to Canadian bills of rights. Indeed, in the Bill of Rights case Hogan v. The Queen (1978), the Supreme Court found the right to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> one may see a lawyer did not exist even in a penumbra of the Bill of Rights. [...] "In effect," [...] Professors F.L. Morton and Rainer Knopff write, [...] "section 10(b) of the Charter overrules Hogan." ...|$|R

She <b>was</b> also <b>told</b> <b>that</b> she <b>was</b> bordering on being harsh with her dog. Beth Joy had put Bella Starlet {{in a dress}} that covered most of her body, {{which resulted in the}} judges being unable to evaluate her grooming.|$|R
25|$|It was {{probably}} this work which contained {{a story about}} souls, where we <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> there were once spirits {{who lived in a}} state of bliss, but having committed a crime (the nature of which is unknown) they were punished by being forced to become mortal beings, reincarnated from body to body. Humans, animals, and even plants are such spirits. The moral conduct recommended in the poem may allow us to become like gods again.|$|E
25|$|Say we <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> a {{woman has}} two children. If we ask whether either {{of them is a}} girl, and are told yes, what is the {{probability}} that the other child is also a girl? Considering this new child independently, one might expect the probability that the other child is female is ½ (50%). But by building a probability space (illustrating all possible outcomes), we see that the probability is actually only ⅓ (33%). This is because the possibility space illustrates 4 ways of having these two children: boy-boy, girl-boy, boy-girl, and girl-girl. But we were given more information. Once we <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> one of the children is a female, we use this new information to eliminate the boy-boy scenario. Thus the probability space reveals that there are still 3 ways to have two children where one is a female: boy-girl, girl-boy, girl-girl. Only ⅓ of these scenarios would have the other child also be a girl. Using a probability space, we are less likely to miss one of the possible scenarios, or to neglect the importance of new information. For further information, see Boy or girl paradox.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> {{they should}} put the {{interests}} of God's Kingdom first {{in their lives and}} that other secular and recreational pursuits should remain secondary to spiritual matters. Witnesses are frequently instructed through Watch Tower Society publications, and at meetings and conventions, to increase {{the quality and quantity of}} their preaching efforts. Watch Tower Society publications suggest that endurance in public preaching is a requirement for Witnesses to attain salvation, and that evangelizing frees them from blood-guilt regarding individuals who might die at Armageddon without having heard about God's kingdom.|$|E
