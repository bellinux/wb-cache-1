Dear Auditor: Thank {{you for your}} interest in RAB’s certification program for Environmental Management Systems (EMS) and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Auditors.</b> This program is intentionally designed to be rigorous, thorough, and fair and to offer assurance to all that RAB-certified auditors have attained specific qualifications. It {{is far from a}} “rubber stamp ” process, as our certified auditors tell us that the rigor of the RAB program creates its credibility and value. To earn RAB certification, you’ll be asked to provide verifiable evidence (just like an audit) of your: • Education • EMS auditor training course • Work experience in environmentally related activities • Personal character attributes • Demonstrated EMS or environmental audit experience (for three of four certification grades) Aside from your personal satisfaction in knowing that you meet the stringent requirements of an internationally respected program, certification through RAB provides recognition and acceptance. RAB certification is an independent verification and attestation to your professional auditing credentials. Once you attain RAB certification, you can benefit from enhanced recognition in your workplace from your supervisor, other management, and from your peers. Beyond your workplace, RAB certification is seen as an important acknowledgment of the credibility of your work and a formal recognition of your auditing experience. When you are performing audits, your acceptance and credibility are enhanced when you are certified by a respected and proven auditor certification body such as RAB. Additionally, if your organization is audited, your responses carry more weight and acceptance when the visiting auditor knows that you are an RAB-certified auditor. Not only is RAB auditor certification an important investment in your current job, it can enhance your professional future as well. RAB certification can help you maximize your career potential and attain your professional goals. Again, thank you for your interest in RAB’s auditor certification program.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} climate change and carbon dioxide emissions from the built environment is resulting in the need to visualize the environmental performance of buildings. One of the recent drivers in the UK has been the tightening of building regulations relating to energy consumption in buildings, mandating all buildings to be performance evaluated by <b>accredited</b> <b>environmental</b> simulation tools to test their carbon dioxide emission against set targets.

40|$|Environmental impact {{assessment}} {{is a widely}} accepted planning tool used in environmental management. Internationally it has been adopted as a formal permitting requirement for development projects in many jurisdictions. Historically the {{focus has been on}} the pre-decision making stages of environmental {{impact assessment}}. It has, however, been widely acknowledged that post-decision environmental impact assessment follow-up is an important component in confirming initial predictions, enabling responsible adaptive management of environmental impacts and ensuring compliance with permit conditions. It is this last function which is the focus of this study. Specifically, the role of permit conditions in enabling compliance and facilitating compliance monitoring is addressed. Permit conditions of twenty-one environmental authorisations were examined and tested for conformance with legislated requirements, and practicality of monitoring for compliance (monitorability). It was found that there are many contributors to achieving monitorable permit conditions. Amongst the most significant of these are conformity in interpretation of the regulations specifying permit content by officials, gaps in guidance {{on the part of the}} regulations themselves, and a tendency to focus on construction related impacts. The lack of clarity regarding the roles and functions of environmental control officer and <b>environmental</b> <b>auditor</b> further contribute to poor monitorability of permit conditions.

The results indicate that strategic environmental managers and accountants believe that environmentally induced costs and expenses should be reported as notes to financial statements, rather than only in the {{profit and loss statement}} in the corporate annual report. However, results are inconclusive as to whether certain strategic environmentally induced expenditure should be capitalized and amortized separately in the balance sheet, while there is some support environmentally induced end- of-pipe and integrated technologies being recognized separately as assets in the balance sheet.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{study the}} {{behavior}} of industrial firms in India in the electricity market and with respect to locational choice and environmental regulation. In the first chapter, I study the competitive effects of transmission infrastructure on market outcomes in the Indian day-ahead electricity market. Transmission constraints may increase local market power by limiting competition across regions. I find that bidders in import-constrained regions do raise bid prices in response to congestion and I simulate the effects of relaxing transmission constraints using a structural model of power-market bidding. The welfare gain from infrastructure expansion is large {{as a share of}} market surplus and mostly due to the strategic responses of bidders to a better-integrated market. In the second chapter, I study the agglomeration of manufacturing activity in India. Industry in India is shown to be spatially agglomerated to an extent similar to that observed in the United States and perhaps slightly greater. All the Marshallian forces of linkages in goods, labor and ideas between industries are important for industrial colocation, with hiring similar workers the strongest predictor of coagglomeration patterns. Finally, in the third chapter, my advisors, Esther Duflo and Michael Greenstone, Rohini Pande and I measure the effects of auditor independence on the reliability of reports by third-party <b>environmental</b> <b>auditors</b> and the regulatory compliance of the firms they audit, using a field experiment. We find that a reformed audit system in which auditors were randomly assigned to plants, monitored and given incentives for accuracy greatly improves the accuracy of auditor reporting, as measured by independent backchecks of true pollution levels. Moreover, the treatment plants subject to greater scrutiny under the reformed audit system responded by reducing pollution output relative to the control group. by Nicholas James Ryan. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|The {{success of}} the global Eco-schools program is {{dependent}} on the quality of its teachers who often struggle with their own sense of capacity and agency as they meet requirements not only of the program, but also their local educational contexts. Negotiation of these sometimes competing demands can profoundly affect teachers’ senses of identity and agency. Postcolonialism, with its focus on challenging everyday effects of power, offers an innovative lens to the investigation of teacher identity and self-perceptions of capacity and agency in environmental education. My research draws explicitly on postcolonial theory as a way of unpacking a politics of identity. It provides a telling case study of Eco-schools teachers in South Africa and their adoption, negotiation and resistance of different teacher identities made available through Eco-schooling policies and practices. I describe my methodology as a Postcolonial Discourse Analysis drawing on both postcolonial and post-structural theory. In order to explore how Eco-schooling identities are negotiated in South Africa, I analysed international and South African Eco-schools policies, publications and curriculum resources. I also interviewed Eco-schools teachers about their experiences of the program. The postcolonial discourse analysis framework I developed illuminated insights into the kinds of teacher identities that were and weren’t made available in global and local contexts. The results showed that there are strong global discourses that that shape teacher identities in Eco-Schools such as those that construct teachers as environmental managers, action facilitators, project managers, <b>environmental</b> <b>auditors</b> and entrepreneurs, but in South Africa there are equally strong local teacher identities made available. These can often be negative and disempowering racialized identities such as underperforming, incompetent, privileged or racist environmental educators. In discussing the results, I show how Eco-schools teachers are both taking up and resisting dominant discourses available across these global and local arenas and creating new hybrid identities that offer new spaces for teacher agency. Postcolonial discourse analysis has provided an insight into the ways South African Eco-schools teachers are engaging with Eco-schools to displace local racialized representations with more positive hybrid teacher identities that embody stronger senses of environmental and educational agency. These insights into identity negotiations are significant in helping build broader understandings around agency in environmental educators particularly at the global/local interface...|$|R

There is a requirement to investigate the quality of work performed by South African food safety auditors. {{in order to establish}} whether they do in fact add value when conducting registration and certification audits. This is also an indication of the importance of improving and maintaining a high standard of food safety in the food services industry. The overall concept of food safety in South Africa IS clearly not defined. understood by only a few consumers, and not widely accepted. Research has shown that food retailers in South Africa in general do not believe food safety auditors are competent. In the wake of the Sudan Red scare two years ago. a long awaited food safety initiative was launched in February 2006. The scare pertaining to a carcinogenic food dye. which found its way into spices on local supermarket shelves, mobilized food industry role players to improve food safety standards. Under the auspices of the Consumer Goods Council of South Africa (CGCSA), the body responsible for establishing best practices and implementation standards, Food Safety South Africa (FSSA) will enable an organization to determine the exact nature and extent of possible and actual problems along the food supply chain. The key objectives of this research study are to determine whether one food certification standard is needed in South Africa and to assess the value added by the food auditors to their clients. Social research will be conducted within the ambit of the dissertation, with case study serving as research method. Both quantitative and qualitative research paradigms will be used to gather data for the research survey in support of the research question. forming the crux of the dissertation which reads as follow: "How can food safety auditors increase value added to the audit process in food environments in South Africa?...|$|R

40|$|The {{implementation}} of {{environmental management systems}} {{is a way for}} the Swedish government to manage the work for sustainable development via central government agencies. Environmental management systems (EMS) were originally developed as a tool for continual improvement of environmental performance in industrial companies, following the circle of “Plan, Do, Check, Act”. The aim of using EMS was to facilitate integration of environmental considerations in all agency activities, both internal and external.  The purpose of the thesis is to study translation processes of environmental issues related to the EMS project in central government agencies. In order to study the construction of environmental issues in EMS work in agencies, and the consequences of these constructions in relation to ecological sustainable development, four studies have been conducted; first, a study of documents related to the EMS project; second, a study of the Swedish Road Administration and their work with EMS; third, a study of translations in the network for EMS implementation; and fourth, a focus group study of management groups in five agencies. The analysis shows how the external references have been a central part of the translation processes taking place in the EMS project. This is explained {{as a result of the}} use of the international EMS standard, ISO 14001, which has become a frequent reference in the project. The influence of ISO 14001 is explained in the thesis as a consequence of the perceived lack of interest at management and government levels in the {{implementation of}} EMS projects in agencies. Related to the common adoption are also the external, certified <b>environmental</b> <b>auditors</b> and consultants auditing the results of the EMS implementation and thereby influencing the translation processes taking place in the project. As a result the activities for sustainable development by state agencies have become an issue for the audit and judgement by private actors. Another consequence is the focus of the measurable and non-conflict environmental aspects matching the EMS rationale. Contested environmental issues however do not match the model and may therefore attain less attention of environmental management. Under the influence of the EMS rationale the translation of ecological sustainable development becomes restricted to environmental issues constructed as EMS issues. Related to this is the learning that remains restricted to the EMS rationale. A vital implication is the need for dialogue on the role of state administration for sustainable development beyond EMS activities...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{aimed to develop}} the {{preliminary}} design concept for a future landfill cell (Cell 3 of 5) at the Johnston’s Road Landfill site, situated {{on the outskirts of}} Bairnsdale in East Gippsland, Victoria. The project was completed on behalf of East Gippsland Shire Council, with the expectation that this project will then form the basis of the complete design and documentation for the landfill cell. The concept created has an operational capacity of three years, including waste and daily/weekly cover requirements and meets or exceeds the minimum best practice guidelines as set out in the EPA Victoria publication 788, Siting, Design, Operation and Rehabilitation of Landfills. All elements of the landfill system were examined, these included: • Siting Conditions and environmental assessment – identification of need, buffer distances, groundwater, surface water, flora and fauna, existing infrastructure, geology and land ownership; • Site layout – examine suitability of existing and future requirements, as well as existing access issues;• Landfill liner system – minimum or recommended liner types and methods, sub-base requirements, clay liner, geo-membrane and protection layer and finally, the drainage layer and geo-textile use; • Water management – Storm water management and existing issues, groundwater management, leachate generation rates and modeling using a HELP package; • Landfill gas; • Odour and noise impacts; and • Site security and fencing The landfill Cell was designed as an extension to the previous Cell (Cell 2), and has the capacity to hold 175, 163 m 3 of waste, placed in six 2 m thick layers, with each layer separated by 0. 3 m of cover materials. The finished height was designed to match with the previous cells, which allows for a uniform and useful area once landfill activities are complete. The overall footprint of the landfill is approximately 2. 2 ha, with a base size of 120 m x 84 m, and uses 3 : 1 batters on the Cell walls. The proposed leachate system utilizes a number of 110 mm Class 16 HDPE pipes, spaced at 15 m intervals. These pipe diameters were based upon inspection and maintenance access requirements as opposed to flows, as the HELP modeling results indicated that leachate volumes generated were not overly large (0. 036 L/sec) Once the preliminary design concept was established, the focus of the project moved towards preparation of the documentation, namely construction specifications.

The data of the study is collected from the financial annual reports of the said listed companies during as at 31 st December, 2014. The dependent variable environmental disclosure is derived from the Global Reporting Initiative checklist while the executive and non-executive auditors are the number of executive and non-executive auditors in the audit committee of the company respectively. Using ordinary least square regression to test the hypothesis of the study however, the result of the study shows that while executive auditors have no significant relationship with <b>environmental</b> disclosure, non-executive <b>auditors</b> is found to be positively significant impacted on environmental disclosure in Nigerian environmentally sensitive listed industries...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{adverse effects}} of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO) on the environment are a growing concern. The air quality issues of most concern to CAFO vary but generally include ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, greenhouse gases, and odors. Air pollutants may be regulated by federal and state laws or by nuisance complaints. The United States Environmental Protection Agency, and poultry, swine, and dairy industries recently agreed to the National Air Emissions Monitoring System to fund research on atmospheric emissions from production farms in the United States. Air quality regulations may be based on actual emissions, atmospheric concentrations, or human perception, or via limiting the size or location of CAFO. Measuring the concentrations or emissions of most air pollutants is expensive and complex. Because of spatial and temporal variability, concentrations and emissions must be measured continuously {{over an extended period}} of time. Because different methods or models can give different results with the same data set, a multitude of methods should be used simultaneously to assure emissions are reasonable. The “best” method to measure concentrations and emissions will depend upon atmospheric concentrations, cost, facility characteristics, objectives, and other factors. In the future, requirements for monitoring of air emissions from CAFO will probably increase. Reliable processbased models need to be developed so that emissions of air pollutants can be estimated from readily obtained diet, animal, facility, and <b>environmental</b> variables. <b>Auditors</b> will need to be trained in a variety of disciplines including animal sciences, chemistry, engineering, micrometeorology, instrumentation, modeling, and logic...|$|R
