The present results, obtained using short-range correlation functions along with long-range correlations in the Schrödinger equation at the same time, agree very well with the results obtained in an earlier calculation by Bhatia et al.

We {{investigate}} {{the use of}} cohesive theories of fracture, {{in conjunction with the}} explicit resolution of the near-tip plastic fields and the enforcement of closure as a contact constraint, for the purpose of fatigue-life prediction. An important characteristic of the cohesive laws considered here is that they exhibit unloading-reloading hysteresis. This feature has the important consequence of preventing shakedown and allowing for steady crack growth.

40|$|Quasi {{two-dimensional}} random site percolation model {{objects were}} fabricate based on computer generated templates. Samples {{consisting of two}} compartments, a reservoir of H$_ 2 $O gel attached to a percolation model object which was initially filled with D$_ 2 $O, were examined with NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) microscopy for rendering proton spin density maps. The propagating proton/deuteron inter-diffusion profiles were recorded and evaluated with respect to anomalous diffusion parameters. The deviation of the concentration profiles from those expected for unobstructed diffusion directly reflects the anomaly of the propagator for diffusion on a percolation cluster. The fractal dimension of the random walk, $d_w$, evaluated from the diffusion measurements {{on the one hand}} and the fractal dimension, $d_f$, deduced from the spin density map of the percolation object on the other permits one to experimentally compare dynamical and static exponents. Approximate calculations of the propagator are given on the basis of the fractional diffusion equation. Furthermore, the ordinary diffusion equation was solved numerically for the corresponding initial and boundary conditions for comparison. The anomalous diffusion constant was evaluated and is compared to the Brownian case. Some <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>correction</b> of the propagator is shown to pay tribute to the finiteness of the system.

40|$|The cold {{dark matter}} {{at the center of}} a galaxy will be redistributed by the {{presence}} of a massive black hole. The redistribution may be determined using an approach pioneered by Gondolo and Silk: begin with a model distribution function for the dark matter, and ``grow'' the black hole adiabatically, holding the adiabatic invariants of the motion constant. Unlike the approach of Gondolo and Silk, which adopted Newtonian theory together with <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>correction</b> factors to mimic general relativistic effects, we carry out the calculation fully relativistically, using the exact Schwarzschild geometry of the black hole. We find that the density of dark matter generically vanishes at r= 2 R_S, not 4 R_S as found by Gondolo and Silk, where R_S is the Schwarzschild radius, and that the spike very close to the black hole reaches significantly higher densities. We apply the relativistic adiabatic growth framework to obtain the final dark matter density for both cored and cusped initial distributions. Besides the implications of these results for indirect detection estimates, we show that the gravitational effects of such a dark matter spike are significantly smaller than the relativistic effects of the black hole, including frame dragging and quadrupolar effects, for stars orbiting close to the black hole that might be candidates for testing the black hole no-hair theorems.

The reflectivity of the open water is computed with the three-scale model of Schrader [1995]. Both surface models supply the bistatic scattering coefficients, which define the lower boundary for the atmospheric model. The atmospheric model computes the gaseous absorption by the Liebe et al.

40|$|The {{characteristic}} of the solar acoustic spectrum is such that mode lifetimes get shorter and spatial leaks get closer in frequency as the degree of a mode increases for a given order. A direct consequence of this property is that individual p-modes are only resolved at low and intermediate degrees, and that at high degrees, individual modes blend into ridges. Once modes have blended into ridges, the power distribution of the ridge defines the ridge central frequency and it will mask the true underlying mode frequency. An accurate model of the amplitude of the peaks {{that contribute to the}} ridge power distribution is needed to recover the underlying mode frequency from fitting the ridge. We present the results of fitting high degree power ridges (up to l = 900) computed from several two to three-month-long time-series of full-disk observations taken with the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on-board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory between 1996 and 1999.

40|$|Continuum solvent {{models of}} {{electrolyte}} solutions are extremely useful. However, {{before we can}} use them with confidence, {{it is important to}} test them by comparison with a range of experimental properties. Here, we have adapted our recently developed 1, 2 simple continuum solvent model of ionic solvation free energies to calculate the solvation entropies and partial molar volumes of a group of monovalent and monatomic ions. This procedure gives good quantitative agreement for larger ions, and reproduces key qualitative features, such as the shift to positive entropies of solvation for iodide and the shift to negative partial molar volumes for small cations. Small ions require a correction to account for dielectric saturation effects, which brings them also into good agreement with experiment. We argue that this model does not require <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>corrections,</b> and uses parameters that have good external physical justification. This work therefore establishes that our continuum solvent model can provide a satisfactory understanding of ionic solvation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Random-effects {{meta-analysis}} {{is commonly}} performed by first deriving {{an estimate of}} the between-study variation, the heterogeneity, and subsequently using this as the basis for combining results, i. e., for estimating the effect, the figure of primary interest. The heterogeneity variance estimate however is commonly associated with substantial uncertainty, especially in contexts where there are only few studies available, such as in small populations and rare diseases. METHODS: Confidence intervals and tests for the effect may be constructed via a simple normal approximation, or via a Student-t distribution, using the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman (HKSJ) approach, which additionally uses a refined estimator of variance of the effect estimator. The modified Knapp-Hartung method (mKH) applies an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>correction</b> and has been proposed to prevent counterintuitive effects and to yield more conservative inference. We performed a simulation study to investigate the behaviour of the standard HKSJ and modified mKH procedures in a range of circumstances, with a focus on the common case of meta-analysis based on only a few studies. RESULTS: The standard HKSJ procedure works well when the treatment effect estimates to be combined are of comparable precision, but nominal error levels are exceeded when standard errors vary considerably between studies (e. g. due to variations in study size). Application of the modification on the other hand yields more conservative results with error rates closer to the nominal level. Differences are most pronounced in the common case of few studies of varying size or precision. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the modified mKH procedure is recommended, especially when only a few studies contribute to the meta-analysis and the involved studies' precisions (standard errors) vary.

40|$|Time-distance {{helioseismology}} {{is one of}} {{the primary}} tools for studying the solar meridional circulation. However, travel-time measurements of the subsurface meridional flow suffer from a variety of systematic errors, such as a center-to-limb variation and an offset due to the P-angle uncertainty of solar images. Here we apply the time-distance technique to contemporaneous medium-degree Dopplergrams produced by SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI to obtain the travel-time difference caused by meridional circulation throughout the solar convection zone. The P-angle offset in MDI images is measured by cross-correlating MDI and HMI images. The travel-time measurements in the south-north and east-west directions are averaged over the same observation period for the two data sets and then compared to examine the consistency of MDI and HMI travel times after correcting the systematic errors. The offsets in the south-north travel-time difference from MDI data induced by the P-angle error gradually diminish with increasing travel distance. However, these offsets become noisy for travel distances corresponding to waves that reach the base of the convection zone. This suggests that a careful treatment of the P-angle problem is required when studying a deep meridional flow. After correcting the P-angle and the removal of the center-to-limb effect, the travel-time measurements from MDI and HMI are consistent within the error bars for meridional circulation covering the entire convection zone. The fluctuations observed in both data sets are highly correlated and thus indicate their solar origin rather than an instrumental origin. Although our results demonstrate that the <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>correction</b> is capable of reducing the wide discrepancy in the travel-time measurements from MDI and HMI, we cannot exclude the possibility that there exist other systematic effects acting on the two data sets in the same way.

J Am Chem Soc 1994, 116, 5898) {{has been successful}} as a method for calculating nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts. The key to this success is the introduction of an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>correction</b> to the excitation energies represented by simple orbital energy differences in uncoupled density functional theory. It has been suggested (Jamorski, C.; Casida, M. E.; Salahub, D. R. J Chem Phys 1996, 104, 5134) that the good performance of this methodology could be partly explained by the resemblance of the corrected excitation energy to the orbital energy difference given by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). In fact, according to exact (wave function) time-dependent perturbation theory, both magnetic and electric perturbations may be described using essentially the same simple SOS expression. However in adiabatic TDDFT, with no explicit relativistic or current density functional dependence, the functional is approximate and so the magnetic and electric SOS expressions are different. Because TDDFT (neglecting relativistic and current density functional dependence) is formally exact for electric perturbations but not magnetic perturbations and because the two SOS expressions {{should have the same}} form, we propose that the SOS expression for electric perturbations should also be used for magnetic perturbations. We then go on to realize our theory by deriving a “Loc. 3 ” approximation that is explicitly designed by applying the electric field SOS expression to magnetic fields within the two-level model and Tamm–Dancoff approximation. Test results for 13 small organic and inorganic molecules show that the Loc. 3 approximation performs at least as well as the “Loc. 1 ” and “Loc. 2 ” approximations of SOS-DFPT...|$|E

It is, however, often neglected in manpower forecasting studies. In this paper, we develop a flow model with which we can forecast the replacement demand at a detailed level of types of education. The essential element of the model is the determination of the yearly outflow coefficients for each type of education, distinguished by age category and gender. Instead of applying a fixed coefficient approach (Willems and De Grip (1993), we will introduce the random coefficient estimation technique in the model. This technique takes the reliability of the flow coefficients explicitly into account. If a specific flow coefficient is unreliable, the random coefficient estimate will tend towards the mean value for that age category over the types of education. This means that <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>corrections</b> based on judgmental forecasting can be considerably reduced. Moreover, it will be shown that the random coefficient estimates of labour market outflow are more reliable than the estimates of the Willems/De Grip model. ...|$|R

Soc. 116, 5898 (1994) ] has allowed a significant improvement in the accuracy of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shift values over the Hartree–Fock approximation. Furthermore, due to its computational efficiency, SOS-DFPT has opened the way to the study of systems of increased size compared to those that may be approached by more sophisticated but also computationally more intensive methods, such as Møller–Plesset perturbation theory or coupled-cluster theory. The success of SOS-DFPT relies on the introduction of an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>correction</b> to the excitation energy that improves the calculation of the paramagnetic component of the NMR shielding tensor. The lack of a clear physical basis for this approximation has left the SOS-DFPT open to some criticism. We have shown in a previous article [E. Fadda, M. E. Casida, and D. R. Salahub, Int. J. Quantum Chem. 91, 67 (2003) ] that the electric field and magnetic field responses are given by equivalent expressions within the Tamm–Dancoff approximation of time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT). This provides an SOS-DFPT expression which, upon restriction to diagonal contributions, yields a new rigorous “Loc. 3 ” approximation. In this article, we more than double our original test set of 10 molecules for 13 C, 15 N, and 17 O chemical shifts to a set of 25 molecules. In addition, we compare the results of “Loc. 3 ” SOS-DFPT with the results of promising recent functionals for DFT calculations of chemical shifts. The results show not only that the “Loc. 3 ” approximation represents the rigorous physical connection between SOS-DFPT and TD-DFT, but also that it has very good potential for the prediction of NMR shielding constants, opening the way to further developments in DFT-based NMR parameter calculations...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} many {{photochemical}} and photophysical problems requires that non-adiabatic effects {{are taken into}} account. Since non-adiabatic effects are fully quantum features, quantum methods {{would be the most}} suitable choice. Alas, due to the exponential scaling with the number of coordinates, quantum methods are not affordable to treat molecular systems with more than four or five atoms, and one has to resort to a semiclassical method. Semiclassical methods are interesting in many ways. Many of them scale only linearly with the number of particles. Moreover semiclassical methods are naturally suited to be performed ``on the fly''. The widest used semiclassical method for the non-adiabatic dynamics is probably Tully's Surface Hopping method. The nuclear motion is represented by a swarm of classical trajectories. Each trajectory runs on a single PES (the ``current'' state) and the probability of hopping on another potential energy surface is calculated with the ``Fewest Switches'' algorithm. One of the main problems of Surface Hopping is the lack of quantum decoherence. This implies that the populations of different electronic states are not treated accurately, in particular when a trajectory gets far from the strong coupling regions. We tried to correct the SH algorithm to account for the quantum decoherence without give up the independent trajectories approach. The developed method is not an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>correction,</b> but is rather based on a physically motivated model. Approximate trajectories are also computed on PES different from the ``current'' one, and gaussian wavepacket are associated with each trajectory. The decay of the overlap between wavepackets on different PES accounts for the main decoherence effects. In this way the computed results depend on a single parameter associated to the gaussian width. The method has been tested on various two state models, with various dimensionalities (from 1 to 72 coordinates). The results of our method compare well with quantum results. Many future developements are possible, from the application to other model systems to an improved description of the wavepacket time evolution...|$|E
40|$|With the {{recognition}} of the importance of evidence-based medicine, there is an emerging need for methods to systematically synthesize available data. Specifically, methods to provide accurate estimates of test characteristics for diagnostic tests are needed to help physicians make better clinical decisions. To provide more flexible approaches for meta-analysis of diagnostic tests, we developed three Bayesian generalized linear models. Two of these models, a bivariate normal and a binomial model, analyzed pairs of sensitivity and specificity values while incorporating the correlation between these two outcome variables. Noninformative independent uniform priors were used for the variance of sensitivity, specificity and correlation. We also applied an inverse Wishart prior to check the sensitivity of the results. The third model was a multinomial model where the test results were modeled as multinomial random variables. All three models can include specific imaging techniques as covariates in order to compare performance. Vague normal priors were assigned to the coefficients of the covariates. The computations were carried out using the 2 ̆ 7 Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling 2 ̆ 7 implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. We investigated the properties of the three proposed models through extensive simulation studies. We also applied these models to a previously published meta-analysis dataset on cervical cancer as well as to an unpublished melanoma dataset. In general, our findings show that the point estimates of sensitivity and specificity were consistent among Bayesian and frequentist bivariate normal and binomial models. However, in the simulation studies, the estimates of the correlation coefficient from Bayesian bivariate models are not as good as those obtained from frequentist estimation regardless of which prior distribution was used for the covariance matrix. The Bayesian multinomial model consistently underestimated the sensitivity and specificity regardless of the sample size and correlation coefficient. In conclusion, the Bayesian bivariate binomial model provides the most flexible framework for future applications because of its following strengths: (1) it facilitates direct comparison between different tests; (2) it captures the variability in both sensitivity and specificity simultaneously as well as the intercorrelation between the two; and (3) it can be directly applied to sparse data without <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>correction.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|A set of EISCAT UHF and VHF {{observations}} is {{used for}} calibrating a coupled fluid-kinetic model of the ionosphere. The data gathered in the period 1200 - 2400 UT on 24 March 1995 had various intervals of interest for such a calibration. The magnetospheric activity was very low during the afternoon, allowing for a proper examination of a case of quiet ionospheric conditions. The radars entered the auroral oval just after 1900 UT: a series of dynamic events probably associated with rapidly moving auroral arcs was observed until after 2200 UT. No {{attempts were made to}} model the dynamical behaviour during the 1900 – 2200 UT period. In contrast, the period 2200 – 2400 UT was characterised by quite steady precipitation: this latter period was then chosen for calibrating the model during precipitation events. The adjustment of the model on the four primary parameters observed by the radars (namely the electron concentration and temperature and the ion temperature and velocity) needed external inputs (solar fluxes and magnetic activity index) and the adjustments of a neutral atmospheric model in order to reach a good agreement. It is shown that for the quiet ionosphere, only slight adjustments of the neutral atmosphere models are needed. In contrast, adjusting the observations during the precipitation event requires strong departures from the model, both for the atomic oxygen and hydrogen. However, it is argued that this could well be the result of inadequately representing the vibrational states of N 2 during precipitation events, and that these factors have to be considered only as <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>corrections...</b>|$|R
40|$|The land surface {{component}} of the hydrological cycle is fundamental to the overall functioning of the atmospheric and climate processes. Spatially and temporally variable rainfall and available energy, combined with land surface heterogeneity cause complex variations in all processes related to surface hydrology. The characterization of the spatial and temporal variability of water and energy cycles are critical to improve our understanding of land surface-atmosphere interaction {{and the impact of}} land surface processes on climate extremes. Because the accurate knowledge of these processes and their variability is important for climate predictions, most Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) centers have incorporated land surface schemes in their models. However, errors in the NWP forcing accumulate in the surface and energy stores, leading to incorrect surface water and energy partitioning and related processes. This has motivated the NWP to impose <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>corrections</b> to the land surface states to prevent this drift. A proposed methodology is to develop Land Data Assimilation schemes (LDAS), which are uncoupled models forced with observations, and not affected by NWP forcing biases. The proposed research is being implemented as a real time operation using an existing Surface Vegetation Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (SVATS) model at a 40 km degree resolution across the United States to evaluate these critical science questions. The model will be forced with real time output from numerical prediction models, satellite data, and radar precipitation measurements. Model parameters will be derived from the existing GIS vegetation and soil coverages. The model results will be aggregated to various scales to assess water and energy balances and these will be validated with various in-situ observations...|$|R
