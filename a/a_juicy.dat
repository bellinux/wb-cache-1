25|$|In March, {{three models}} with the world's first {{electric}} power steering (CGPF/CGPL/CGPJ) {{were added to the}} lineup, at <b>a</b> <b>juicy</b> ¥150,000 surcharge. Actress and pop idol Yuka Ōnishi (大西結花) was the spokesperson for the ad campaign, while an all female motorcycle racing team (Team Angela) raced a Turbocharged Cervo in the Safari Rally. However, it was all to no avail: The rivals, Daihatsu's new Leeza and Mazda's Autozam Carol both sold much better. Combined with the removal of certain tax breaks for small cargo vehicles, this meant that the Cervo's already narrow slot in the market had essentially disappeared. When the new 660cc Kei regulations were introduced, Suzuki decided to call it quits rather than {{spend a lot of money}} to update such a slow-selling vehicle and Cervo production ended in May 1990.|$|E

50|$|In meats, {{the acid}} causes the tissue to break down, which allows more {{moisture}} {{to be absorbed}} and results in <b>a</b> <b>juicier</b> end product; however, too much acid can be detrimental to the end product. A good marinade has a balance of acid, oil, and spice. If raw marinated meat is frozen, the marinade can break down the surface and turn the outer layer mushy.|$|R
25|$|The Barbera grape is {{the most}} widely planted variety {{in all of the}} Piedmont and makes <b>a</b> <b>juicy,</b> muscular red wine that is not as tannic as Barolo and Barbaresco. It is grown in nearly every major wine making region of the Piedmont but seems to do best in the {{southern}} part of the province of Asti in the Nizza DOCG zone. Some producers are experimenting with blending Barbera with Nebbiolo to combine the former's fruitiness with the later's structure. The light fruitiness of wines from the Dolcetto grape has caused some wine writers to describe it as the Italian version of Beaujolais. The wines have a sense of spiciness to them with little acid and tannins. They are able to be drunk relatively young and tend to be the every day drinking wines of the Piedmontese.|$|E
500|$|The final fight scene between Sharon and Lisa was lauded by critics. Marjorie Baumgarten from The Austin Chronicle stated that, {{despite the}} {{predictability}} of its plot, Obsessed caters to [...] "the American moviegoers' appetite for <b>a</b> <b>juicy</b> catfight." [...] E! Online's Natasha Vargas-Cooper lauded the choreography and noted {{the scene as}} {{the highlight of the}} film. McKiernan called it the [...] "best knock-down, drag-out girlfight" [...] of 2009. However, Alex Navarro from Screened called the fight [...] "boring" [...] because of the poor filming and editing of the scene.|$|E
500|$|A March 2015 {{article in}} Bloomberg said an {{increasing}} number of executive staff at Kaspersky Lab previously worked for Russian military and intelligence agencies. According to News & Observer, Kaspersky [...] "published a mammoth response, tearing down Bloomberg's accusations and accusing them of throwing facts out the window for the sake of <b>a</b> <b>juicy</b> anti-Russian narrative." [...] Competitor FireEye said many U.S. IT companies also have executives that formerly worked for government military and intelligence agencies. NPR reported that Kaspersky has been doing an increasing amount of business with Russian cybersecurity agencies to catch cybercriminals. Kaspersky confirmed that Russian agencies are among its government customers.|$|E

[...] She was pleased with the emphasis on Jim and the way he [...] "wonderfully bookended the conflicting emotions Michael inspires." [...] West also believed that the [...] "writers did a great job of creating the sense of crisis that resulted in the Scranton branch instead absorbing Stamford (I never trusted that Josh guy) even though fans of the original {{knew it was going to}} end up that way."

500|$|Clouzot {{was very}} {{demanding}} with his actors and would often quarrel {{with them to}} get them in the mood he desired. Suzy Delair recalled that Clouzot slapped her, but said of it, [...] "So what? He slapped others as well...He was tough but I'm not about to complain". Pierre Fresnay recalled that Clouzot [...] "worked relentlessly, which made for <b>a</b> <b>juicy</b> spectacle...That's to say nothing for his taste of violence, which he never tried with me". When working with Bardot, one scene required Bardot's character to drool and sleep. Clouzot offered her powerful sleeping pills, saying they were aspirin, and this led to Bardot's stomach being pumped. Although Clouzot was harsh on his actors, he did not treat them fiercely off set. Delair recalled that off set there was an [...] "innocence about him" [...] that was not seen.|$|E
500|$|Bill Lamb of About.com {{ranked the}} song amongst the top tracks on Kiss & Tell. Mikael Wood of Billboard gave the song a {{positive}} review, stating that it [...] "has <b>a</b> <b>juicy</b> and instantly memorable vocal hook". In {{a review of}} the album, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy coined the song [...] "electro-thumping", commenting that it was [...] "as innocent as the purity ring on Gomez's finger and showcases her polished vocals perfectly." [...] Copsey also stated that the impressive hooks present in the song do not appear on the album anywhere else. In a single review, Nick Levine also of Digital Spy said was the most Disney-affiliated single with club appeal since Miley Cyrus' [...] "See You Again". When commenting on whether Gomez would be a mainstay in music, Levine said, [...] "It's too soon to tell - but most Scando-popettes would dye their locks brunette for this tune." [...] Although stating that it was very cliche, a writer for Popjustice said that the song [...] "seems like a boundary-smashing avant garde curiosity when you put it alongside most other Hollywood Records output." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com ranked [...] "Naturally" [...] at number eighty-four on his list of [...] "Top 100 Pop Songs of 2010".|$|E

2500|$|Matt Roush for TV Guide {{compared}} the V pilot to science-fiction shows Lost and FlashForward, noting that V is [...] "undeniably more simplistic [...] in its us-vs.-them setup", but commenting {{that he was}} [...] "instantly seduced and hooked by its lavish production values, the immediately gripping storyline and a strong cast", concluding: V may not initially dig as deep as FlashForward, but there's <b>a</b> <b>juicy</b> urgency {{to all of the}} interpersonal and intergalactic melodrama, with plenty of action and surprising reveals." [...] King Features' entertainment reporter Cindy Elavsky called V: [...] "the best new show on television, by far. The special effects are feature-film quality; the writing is intelligent and time-relevant; and the acting is first-rate. The first five minutes alone will hook you for the entire season." ...|$|E

2500|$|Moreover, Moreton denounces night {{houses and}} cellars as places where prostitutes and thieves meet {{and carry on}} their hellish trade. Here criminals [...] "wait for signal of their scout; here they cast their schemes, and bring in advices; here they {{encourage}} and initiate young thieves; here they barter and sell their stolen goods; these are their exchanges and asylums after mischief". Thus, night houses stand as wicked fortresses for criminals {{and they must be}} suppressed. They were indeed real headquarters of felons, ideal places for the arrangement of their business and for the exchange of goods and information. Apparently they functioned as an unorthodox [...] "club" [...] for wandering criminals where you could be sure to be welcome and to find companionship if <b>a</b> <b>juicy</b> goal just came out.|$|E
2500|$|Bawer's 2012 book The Victims’ Revolution was {{a report}} on, and {{critique}} of, [...] the rise of identity studies in American universities. Identity studies, according to Bawer, reduce the human experience to ideologically charged jargon about power relationships among groups. Publishers Weekly said that while Bawer's “critique seldom engages seriously with the intellectual content of the field,” his book was “a lively, cantankerous takedown of <b>a</b> <b>juicy</b> target” that scored “lots of entertaining points against the insufferable posturing and unreadable prose that pervades identity studies.” Sohbab Ahmari, in The Wall Street Journal, praised the book for its exposure of relativism on campus, while Andrew Delbanco, in The New York Times Book Review, found Bawer's complaints outdated, arguing that universities, in Delbanco's view, are returning to traditional subjects. National Reviews Jay Nordlinger, on the other hand, praised the book's “wonderfulness” and wrote: “I wish people would read The Victims’ Revolution. I especially wish it of students and others in academia.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Arbuthnot was {{attracted}} by the drifting hull of the crippled Wiesbaden. With Warrior, Defence closed in for the kill, only to blunder right into the gun sights of Hipper's and Scheer's oncoming capital ships. Defence was deluged by heavy-calibre gunfire from many German battleships, which detonated her magazines in a spectacular explosion viewed {{by most of the}} deploying Grand Fleet. She sank with all hands (903 officers and men). Warrior was also hit badly, but was spared destruction by a mishap to the nearby battleship Warspite. Warspite had her steering gear overheat and jam under heavy load at high speed as the 5th Battle Squadron made a turn to the north at 18:19. Steaming at top speed in wide circles, Warspite appeared as <b>a</b> <b>juicy</b> target to the German dreadnoughts and took 13 hits, inadvertently drawing fire from the hapless Warrior. Warspite was brought back under control and survived the onslaught, but was badly damaged, had to reduce speed, and withdrew northward; later (at 21:07), she was ordered back to port by Evan-Thomas. Warspite went on to a long and illustrious career, serving also in World War II. Warrior, on the other hand, was abandoned and sank the next day after her crew was taken off at 08:25 on 1 June by Engadine, which towed the sinking armoured cruiser [...] during the night.|$|E

2500|$|... "Window Seat" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{criticism from}} most music critics. PopMatters writer Quentin B. Huff found Badu's vulnerability on the song comparable {{to her work}} on Mama's Gun (2000). Allmusic's Andy Kellman wrote that it [...] "should appeal {{to those who have}} wanted Badu to revisit that lissome sound of Baduizm songs like 'On & On' and 'Otherside of the Game,' and it packs stunning stomp-and-clap breakdowns that sync up with Badu's most halting lines". Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes called it [...] "as amniotic a slow jam as Badu has ever recorded". BBC Online writer Stevie Chick praised Badu's performance on the song, writing that she sings [...] "with such earnest, desperate yearning you’ll be struck dumb". The Washington Posts Chris Richards described the song as [...] "vintage Badu: gentle melodies, a twinkling harp, rim-shots click-clacking at an easy, Sunday morning tempo". Los Angeles Times writer Margaret Wappler praised co-producer and keyboardist James Poyser's contribution, writing that he [...] "elevates" [...] the song [...] "into <b>a</b> <b>juicy</b> slice of escapism but with the security of someone missing you back home". The Village Voices Pazz & Jop annual year-end critics' poll ranked [...] "Window Seat" [...] at number 11 to find the best music of 2010, tied with Arcade Fires [...] "Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)" [...] and LCD Soundsystems [...] "I Can Change".|$|E
