40|$|AbstractAn energy {{balancing}} system (EBS) performs heating <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> by {{utilizing the}} refrigerant cycle. As it produces heating <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> simultaneously, EBS has an advantage when heating <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> demand occur simultaneously. Furthermore, with increase in a thermal storage capacity, it can conduct energy balancing by heating <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> which occur at different times. It {{can result in}} both {{an increase in the}} heating <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> produced by energy balancing and a reduction in operating cost. However, it leads to increase the initial cost of the thermal storage tank. This study suggests that total cost should be considered adapting EBS...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Data centers contain IT, power <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> infras-tructures, each {{of which}} is {{typically}} managed independently. In this paper, we propose a holistic approach that couples the management of IT, power <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> infrastructures to improve the efficiency of data center operations. Our approach considers application per-formance management, dynamic workload migration/consolidation, <b>and</b> power <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> control to “right-provision ” computing, power <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> resources for a given workload. We have implemented a prototype of this for virtualized environments and conducted experiments in a production data center.

40|$|Heating <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> consume {{half of the}} EU’s {{energy and}} much of it is wasted.

In order to fulfil the EU’s climate and energy goals, the heating <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> sector must therefore sharply reduce its energy consumption and cut its use of fossil fuels. To this end the European Commission adopted a heating <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> strategy in February 2016 as part of the wider Energy Union Package.

5000|$|In the United States, a {{simplified}} method {{is used to}} calculate both heating <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> degree days. The mean (that is, [...] ) daily temperature in Fahrenheit and a nominal temperature of [...] are used. If the mean daily temperature is 65 °F, no degree days are counted. If the mean daily temperature is below 65 °F, the mean degrees Fahrenheit below 65 °F are counted as the heating degree day. If the mean daily temperature is above 65 °F, the mean degrees Fahrenheit above 65 °F are counted as the cooling degree day. The heating <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> degree days are tallied separately to calculate monthly, seasonal, and yearly total heating <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> degree days. Heating <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> degree days closely correlate with heating <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> demand.|$|R

However, degeneracy pressure is independent of temperature; white dwarfs are unable to regulate temperature in the manner of normal stars, so they are vulnerable to runaway fusion reactions.

It is still a matter of considerable debate whether this flare transforms into a supersonic detonation from a subsonic deflagration.|$|E
