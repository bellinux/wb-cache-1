40|$|Health {{insurance}} is the financial {{protection against the}} healthcare costs arising from disease or <b>accidental</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>injury.</b> Social health insurance (SHI) {{is a type of}} health insurance that provides insurance for the population of a country and covers the costs of healthcare. The SHI model is still in its early stages in Pakistan. Hospitals and healthcare are now the responsibility of the provincial governments and modified SHI models have been implemented in some provinces, while others are still contemplating on its workings. However, SHI in Pakistan cannot work unless a national level strategy is implemented...|$|E

40|$|Outside {{the field}} of work injuries, {{negligence}} is certainly the dominant concept in accident law today, but the future of its dominance {{is by no means}} as clear as it must have seemed {{at the turn of the}} century. The sources of doubt are several. For one thing, social insurance legislation may engulf the whole, or a large part, of {{the field of}} <b>accidental</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>injury</b> law. If it does, the legislation might take the form of comprehensive social insurance for disability from any source, as part of the attack on the general problem of poverty. Or, it might take some form of enterprise liability, as workmen 2 ̆ 7 s compensation did, such as that proposed for motor vehicle accidents by Keeton and O 2 ̆ 7 Connell. There is also the possibility that strict liability may further supplant liability based on fault through the common-law process by judicial decision, as it has already done to some extent in the fields of extrahazardous activities and products liability. The first question I shall explore is the effect each of these possible developments would be likely to have on the concept of negligence. Then I shall try to assess briefly the likelihood that such a development will take place...|$|E
