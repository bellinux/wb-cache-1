5|$|After moving in, Moon began <b>a</b> <b>prescribed</b> {{course of}} Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to {{alleviate}} his alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{usage patterns}} of dexmedetomidine {{in the operating}} room after implementation of <b>a</b> <b>prescribing</b> guideline. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis to evaluate the impact of <b>a</b> <b>prescribing</b> guideline on usage patterns of dexmedetomidine {{in the operating room}} at a tertiary, academic medical center during one-month period pre- (July 2010) and post-guideline (July 2011 and July 2012) implementation. Results: A total of 267 patients received intraoperative dexmedetomidine during the study period. Dexmedetomidine use in surgical procedures decreased post-guideline implementation [5. 7 % (pre) vs. 1. 9 % and 3. 3 % (post) ]. The most common guideline-based indication for intraoperative dexmedetomidine was for anesthesia during bariatric surgery (41 % and 38 % in 2011 and 2012, respectively). We estimated a cost-avoidance of $ 308, 856 over the two-year period after guideline implementation. Conclusion: Our results suggest that implementation of <b>a</b> <b>prescribing</b> guideline for the use of dexmedetomidine in the operating room is feasible and associated with improved utilization patterns...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{practitioner}} led definition of <b>a</b> <b>prescribing</b> error {{for use in}} prevalence/incidence studies in paediatric practice. Design: A two stage Delphi technique was used to obtain the views of a panel of expert health professionals working in the hospital paediatric setting. The extent of their agreement on a definition of <b>a</b> <b>prescribing</b> error, and on 40 scenarios that might be classified as prescribing errors in paediatric practice, was obtained. Results: Response rates were 84 % (n = 42) in the first Delphi round and 95 % (n = 40) in the second. Consensus was to accept the general definition of <b>a</b> <b>prescribing</b> error. In addition, there was consensus that 27 of the 40 scenarios should be included as prescribing errors, 10 should be excluded, and three may be considered prescribing errors depending on the individual clinical situation. Failure to communicate essential information, transcription errors {{and the use of}} drugs, formulations, or doses inappropriate for the individual patient were considered prescribing errors. Deviations from policies or guidelines, use of unlicensed and off-label drugs, and omission of non-essential information were not considered <b>prescribing</b> errors. Conclusion: <b>A</b> general definition of <b>a</b> <b>prescribing</b> error has been developed that is applicable to the paediatric setting, together with more detailed guidance regarding the types of events that should be included. These findings are suitable for use in future research into the incidence and nature of prescribing errors in paediatrics. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Many critics have concluded that one minor character or another is portrayed as having the right philosophy.

5|$|Infants and {{patients}} fed via a gastrostomy tube {{can also be}} given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up <b>a</b> <b>prescribed</b> powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed. Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula. Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total cholesterol than a solid ketogenic diet. KetoCal is a nutritionally complete food containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding. Other formula products include KetoVolve and Ketonia. Alternatively, a liquid ketogenic diet may be produced by combining Ross Carbohydrate Free soy formula with Microlipid and Polycose.|$|E

The fatwa also allowed the omission of the prayersnormally performed an obligatory five times a day at prescribed timeswhen they were prevented from doing so, and instructed them to make up the missed prayers at night instead. It also provided instructions for performing the ritual dry ablution (tayammum) when ritually pure water was not available, to replace the ritual ablution (wudu) that is ordinarily required before performing the salat. When tayammum was not possible, even making slight pointing motions with hands or face toward clean earth, stone, or tree was acceptable.|$|E
