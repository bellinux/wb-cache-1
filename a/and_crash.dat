5|$|At 8:32a.m., FAA {{officials}} were notified Flight 11 had been hijacked and {{they in turn}} notified the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). NORAD scrambled two F-15s from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts and they were airborne by 8:53a.m. Because of slow and confused communication from FAA officials, NORAD had 9minutes' notice that Flight 11 had been hijacked, and no notice {{about any of the}} other flights before they crashed. After both of the Twin Towers had already been hit, more fighters were scrambled from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia at 9:30a.m. At 10:20a.m. Vice President Dick Cheney issued orders to shoot down any commercial aircraft that could be positively identified as being hijacked. These instructions were not relayed in time for the fighters to take action.
