40|$|The {{interactions}} of the parasympatholytics <b>adiphenine,</b> <b>adiphenine</b> H, propantheline and the structurally related compounds diphenhydramine, D-propoxyphene and methadone with acetylcholinesterases were studied {{by means of}} kinetic measurements. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was used as membrane-bound enzyme from bovine red cells and in a solubilized form from Electrophorus electricus. All the drugs studied are inhibitors of AChE. Differences between the membrane bound and the solubilized form can be deduced from different inhibitory mechanisms. A mixed competitive-non-competitive mechanism is characteristic for the membrane-bound enzyme, while a predominantly non-competitive mechanism {{is involved in the}} case of the solubilized enzyme. The negative cooperative behaviour of AChE is not changed by these inhibitors. A “two-site” hypothesis for the binding of the investigated drugs is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Propantheline, oxyphenonium, isoproponaide, epidosine, adiphe-nine and {{atropine}} {{were studied}} for {{their effect on}} the superfused infesting of guinea pig and rat. In small, concentrations, all drugs produced a contraction, which with increasing concentration, was Hocked. Occasionally, a contraction and a relaxation or vice versa was recorded. A partial antagonism and a potentiation on the action of acetylcholine (Ach) during recovery was observed. In very high concentrations, all drugs produced a graded contraction of intestine, except <b>adiphenine</b> which produced a sustained contraction. Some- times, a contraction and a relaxation was also observed...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{compounds}} with structural similarities to SKF 525 -A (<b>adiphenine.</b> benactyzine. propoxyphene. diphenhydramine. desipramine. and nortriptyline) {{are capable of}} forming metabo-lite-cytochome P- 450 complexes absorbing maximally at 455 nm when metabolized by rat hepatic microsomes. The optimum substrate concentrations for the maximum rate of formation of 455 -nm complexes in microsomes from untreated rats and from rats pretreated with phenobarbital were between 25 - 50 MM. With microsomes from phenobarbital-induced rats, the maximum rate of formation of 455 -nm complexes was proportional to the concentration of induced cytochrome P- 450. The rate of formation of 455 -nm complexes was highest with microsomes from phenobarbital-induced animals, intermediate with microsomes from untreated rats...|$|E
40|$|Procaine, <b>adiphenine,</b> drofenine, nafronyl, tetracaine, and {{meclofenoxate}} {{and their}} degradation products {{were separated by}} reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on Spherisorb ODS 2 columns (125 or 350 x 4 mm). The mobile phase {{was a mixture of}} acetonitrile or methanol and a buffer solution (pH= 4. 5) of sodium acetate (0. 02 M) and acetic acid. Seven amines with different chemical structures were added respectively into the buffer solution in order to modify the peak tailing and retention behavior of the compounds analyzed. Significant improvement in peak shape and retention time of basic drugs was observed by adding some amines, while in the case of their degradated acids these properties were not modified. Triethylamine was chosen to analyze all the pharmaceuticals studied in this work except for drofenine where di-n-butylamine appeared the best amine...|$|E
40|$|The {{affinity}} of {{a number}} of 'selective' agonists and antagonists has been assessed at atrial or ileal muscarinic receptors by use of in vitro functional analysis. The most selective compound for ileal muscarinic receptors was silabenzhexol (approx. 50 fold), {{and to a lesser extent}} benzhexol (approx. 5 fold). Conversely, the most selective compound for the atrial muscarinic receptors was AF-DX 116 (approx. 6 fold). The novel M 1 -receptor antagonist, telenzepine and other antagonists such as propantheline and isopropamide did not distinguish between atrial and ileal receptors. Dicyclomine, <b>adiphenine,</b> hexahydroadiphenine and oxyphenonium exhibited competitive antagonism at atrial receptors but non-competitive antagonism at ileal receptors. No conclusions could, therefore, be drawn with regard to their selectivity. The agonists, arecaidine propargyl ester (APE), ethoxyethyltriethylammonium (EOE) and carbachol, exhibited some selectivity in potency but little difference in affinity. It is concluded that the study supports the existence of ileal and atrial muscarinic receptor subtypes. However, the use of dicyclomine and related compounds in receptor classification is limited...|$|E

The amphiphilic nature of many pharmaceutical active ingredients often makes them difficult to solubilise and leads to significant wastage through non-optimal dosage. In this study it is shown that highly concentrated liquid formulations can be produced from pharmaceutical active ingredients which either contain a strong hydrogen bonding functionality e. g. -OH or -COOH or a quaternary ammonium moiety. These mixtures can overcome solubility issues in water as the eutectics prevent recrystallization of the active ingredient when dispersed in water. The depression of freezing point for these eutectic mixtures is modelled using the enthalpy of hydrogen bond formation which was calculated using calorimetric data. The study also demonstrates that complex drug molecules which exhibit polymorphism such as <b>Adiphenine</b> and Ranitidine can be formulated into a homogeneous liquid and the hydrogen bond donor can also be a pharmaceutical active ingredient e. g. aspirin.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a double-blind cross-over study in ten volunteers aged from 19 to 30 years, {{to compare the}} pain control effects of a single oral dose of two analgesic compounds (drug A: propyphenazone mg 250, ethylmorphine mg 5, caffeine mg 5; drug B: dipyrone mg 500, diphenhydramine mg 12. 5, <b>adiphenine</b> mg 5, ethyl aminobenzoate mg 2. 5) in an experimental pain model using stimulation of dental pulp. Constant voltage stimuli were delivered through silver chloride electrodes placed {{in contact with the}} vestibular surface of the upper medial incisor. At the beginning of the session, the pain input was graded by asking the subject to identify the weakest stimulus perceived (threshold level) and the strongest stimulus endurable (tolerance level). The range between threshold and tolerance level was divided in nine steps plus a subliminal step. The ten steps were delivered randomly, and each series of steps was repeated eight times. The subjects were instructed to rate the pain sensation in an arbitrary scale of 5 degrees. The procedure was repeated at 60 min and 180 min after drug administration. Each subject received two tablets of drug A or drug B in two different sessions at weekly intervals. Statistical analysis of the procedures showed that neither drug A nor drug B significantly affected the pain threshold. Drug A significantly reduced the total pain score (P less than 0. 01) and its action peaked 60 min after administration. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
