5|$|For the US Navy, the Battle of Savo Island would {{institute}} many changes. Virtually every cruiser {{would be}} retrofitted with emergency diesel electric generators. The fire mains {{of the ships}} would be changed to a verticle loop design that could be broken many times and still function. Fires were set at Savo which were attributed to <b>aviation</b> <b>facilities</b> filled with gas, oil, and planes. Motorboats were filled with gasoline and also caught fire. In some cases, these facilities were dead amidships presenting a perfect target for enemy ships at night. Ready service lockers added to the destruction and {{it was noted that}} these lockers were never close to being depleted. The Commander in Chief would order sweeping changes be made before ships entered surface combat in the future.|$|E

25|$|The First World War had a {{disruptive}} effect on Teignmouth: over 175 {{men from the}} town lost their lives and many businesses did not survive. In the 1920s as the economy started to recover, a golf course opened on Little Haldon; the Morgan Giles shipbuilding business was established, and charabancs took employees and their families for annual outings to Dartmoor and elsewhere. By the 1930s the town was again thriving, and with the Haldon Aerodrome and School of Flying nearby, Teignmouth was advertised as the only south coast resort offering complete <b>aviation</b> <b>facilities.</b>|$|E

25|$|Experiences {{during the}} early part of the Second World War had {{demonstrated}} to the British that the Royal Navy needed access to defensive air cover for Allied fleets and convoys, which could only be provided by more aircraft carriers. In mid-1941, the Director of Naval Construction was instructed to investigate how best to achieve this without the lengthy construction times normally associated with carriers. The options were to refit the surviving Hawkins-class cruisers with flight decks and <b>aviation</b> <b>facilities,</b> convert additional merchant vessels and passenger liners into vessels similar to but more capable than previous merchant aircraft carriers, or create a new design for a cheap, lightly armed, and unarmoured ship similar to the Woolworth carriers. In December 1941, it was decided that a new design was the best option.|$|E
25|$|The PAPD protects {{three major}} airports: Newark Liberty International, John F. Kennedy International, and LaGuardia, which handle over 80 million air passengers, over 1.1 million {{aircraft}} movements, and over 2.5 {{million tons of}} air cargo annually. Together, the three New York area airports create the largest airport system in the entire United States. Policing these <b>aviation</b> <b>facilities</b> involves {{a wide variety of}} duties. Police personnel cover screening points, respond to all aircraft incidents, and aid travelers {{from all parts of the}} world. Escorting and protecting visiting dignitaries is provided for on a daily basis. The PAPD also patrols the Port Authority-owned Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, which is much smaller than the other three airports and operates only general aviation aircraft. The PAPD does not currently patrol the Port Authority-operated Stewart International Airport, which is patrolled by the New York State Police; or the Atlantic City Airport, which is patrolled by the New Jersey State Police.|$|E

25|$|On December 22, 2006 in an {{agreement}} amongst the Coast Guard, National Guard and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts a partnership {{was created in}} which the Coast Guard would assume control of the <b>aviation</b> <b>facilities</b> from the Air Force (Runways, taxiways, etc.) while the Air National Guard will manage the utilities (Electricity, water, sewerage, etc.) and the state will fund the emergency services and fire protection. The Federal Aviation Administration has released new flight procedures that identify the ICAO code KFMH {{with the name of}} Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod. This does not signify a name change as it has not been officially announced. The FAA sometimes does issue plans that call an airport a different name than is commonly known. With the control of the airfield changing hands, improvements to the lighting system were put in control of the Coast Guard. The base is still known as Otis among locals, but the media reports it as Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod.|$|E
25|$|Thus by 1995, more {{buildings}} were added, including two air-conditioned accommodation blocks, an aircraft landing strip, two hangars, a radar station, an {{air traffic control}} tower, watchtowers and a jetty. The <b>aviation</b> <b>facilities</b> on the island allow the operation of C130 Hercules transport planes and CN-235 maritime patrol aircraft operated by the Royal Malaysian Air Force. These facilities made the island a proper island station code-named Station Lima. Patrols by navy soldiers in CB90 attack vessels and larger patrol boats such as the Kedah-class offshore patrol vessels are carried out around the island. The Royal Malaysian Air Force also operate frequently on the airstrip. Several anti-ship and anti-aircraft guns are placed on several areas {{on the island and}} the RMAF personnel operate a Starburst air defence system to prevent low-level air attacks. The rest of the stations were originally floating barge type habitat modules constructed on mainland Malaysia. Location selection and module positioning was done during high tide so that they could be more easily anchored during low tide and after found satisfactory, the modules were landed and filled in with cement and rocks to strengthen their anchorages. They are all also equipped with radar and ship docking facilities as well as water and power generation facilities. Soldiers are stationed on all stations.|$|E
