5|$|A soccer kick, {{also known}} as <b>a</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> kick in puroresu and shoot fighting, is a {{reference}} to a kick that is similar to kicks used in association football. It is the colloquial term for a kick performed against a prone, kneeling, rising or supine opponent by a fighter who is in a standing or semi-standing position, to any part of a downed opponent. The soccer kick was used in the first match of the Ultimate Fighting Championship at UFC 1 in 1993. Gerard Gordeau defeated Teila Tuli with a soccer kick, which also knocked out one of Tuli's teeth. The technique is banned under the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts however other rulesets, including the ones used by Pride Fighting Championships do permit them. Soccer kicks have been regularly discussed as to potential damage. There has been a regular debate on the usage of them within MMA. Some MMA fans and fighters support them while a fight doctor and politicians have opposed them.|$|E
5|$|At {{the scale}} of living cells, foam {{patterns}} are common; radiolarians, sponge spicules, silicoflagellate exoskeletons and the calcite skeleton of a sea urchin, Cidaris rugosa, all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries. The skeleton of the Radiolarian, Aulonia hexagona, a beautiful marine form drawn by Ernst Haeckel, {{looks as if it}} is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The Euler characteristic states that for any convex polyhedron, the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like <b>a</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>ball,</b> Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome, or fullerene molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} eight, Alex {{had begun}} playing both {{basketball}} and football. He would shoot hoops with <b>a</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> and a milk crate nailed to a tree. The sport was becoming increasingly popular in Nigeria due {{to the success of}} National Basketball Association (NBA) center Hakeem Olajuwon and Owumi often followed the NBA. When he was 12, his family moved to England, where they lived for three years. They then settled in Boston after his father joined the Harvard School of Public Health. In sixth grade, he enrolled at the local Tobin K-8 School. He attended Jeremiah E. Burke High School in Dorchester, Boston, where he played basketball and football. Owumi later estimated that he lost, at most, nine high school basketball games. At Burke in 2003, he won The Boston Globe Scholar Athlete Award, given to the top male and female student-athletes in Boston. Owumi was also a part of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball team, Boston Amateur Athletic Club.|$|E

25|$|In cup history, the MLS Cup champions {{have been}} awarded with three {{different}} trophies. For the first three MLS Cup finals, the winning team was awarded with the Alan I. Rothenberg Trophy, named for Rothenberg's contributions to American soccer. The Rothenberg Trophy was a dark gold trophy that had two handles around <b>a</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>ball,</b> with the league's logo imprinted on the plaque. In 1999, the Rothenberg Trophy was redesigned with <b>a</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> placed on a beacon. In 2008, the trophy was redesigned again to its present state and renamed the Philip F. Anschutz Trophy.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the sphere}} has Euler {{characteristic}} 2, {{it follows that}} P = 12. That is, <b>a</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> constructed in this way always has 12 pentagons. In principle, the number of hexagons is unconstrained. This result is also applicable to fullerenes.|$|E

25|$|Buckminster{{fullerene}} (or bucky-ball) is a spherical fullerene molecule {{with the}} formula C60. It has a cage-like fused-ring structure (truncated icosahedron) which resembles <b>a</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> (football), made of twenty hexagons and twelve pentagons, with a carbon atom at each vertex of each polygon and a bond along each polygon edge.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} mascot of this World Cup was Striker, the World Cup Pup, a dog {{wearing a}} red, {{white and blue}} soccer uniform with <b>a</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>ball.</b> Striker was designed by the Warner Bros. animation team. A dog was picked as the mascot because dogs are a common pet in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Its logo has a near-circle thick rim {{with blue}} on the left, purple {{in the middle}} and red on right. It has the club name and the club's {{location}} inside with <b>a</b> football (<b>soccer</b> <b>ball)</b> inside.|$|R

25|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, Nayar {{travelled}} with <b>a</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> from Ivory Coast down to South Africa, blogging along the way. She also maintained her coverage (for CBC and Reuters), following the sub-Saharan teams in the competition during the two months of play. Her blog, named Destination South Africa: A ball and a Mosquito Net, was featured heavily in the media. Because CBC no longer has rights to the World Cup, unfortunately the blog is no longer online.|$|E

25|$|Netball traces {{its roots}} to basketball. Basketball {{was invented in}} 1891 by James Naismith, a Canadian {{physical}} education instructor working in the United States, {{who was trying to}} develop an indoor sport for his students at the YMCA Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts. His game was first played in the campus gymnasium on a court roughly half the size of a regulation NBA court today, between two teams of nine players. It was played with <b>a</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> that was shot into closed-bottom peach baskets that were nailed to the gymnasium wall.|$|E
25|$|In January, 1983, {{a second}} cougar, seven-month-old Kyna--- Welsh for wise or graceful lady--- became SIUE's second live mascot. Chimega's cage had been divided {{in two and}} a large, caged run would later be added. At one time, Kyna was {{released}} by pranksters/vandals. Later, she had severe health issues after eating <b>a</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>ball.</b> Due to liability insurance issues, she was restricted from interacting with the public in late 1986. Then, in June, 1987, the university administration, without consulting students, staff, or alumni, donated Kyna to an exotic animal park. Despite protests, Kyna did not return, and SIUe has since been without a live cougar mascot.|$|E
25|$|The opening {{ceremony}} of the World Cup {{was held on}} 17 June at Chicago's Soldier Field. Numerous dignitaries attended, including United States President Bill Clinton, Chancellor of Germany Helmut Kohl and President of Bolivia Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada. The ceremony was emceed by Oprah Winfrey, who fell off the dais in introducing Diana Ross, who gave a musical performance. Ross was also supposed to kick <b>a</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> into the goal from the penalty spot {{at the beginning of}} her performance, with the goal then splitting in two as part of a pre-orchestrated stunt. She kicked the ball wide to the left, missing the goal, but the goalposts were collapsed anyway in accordance with the stunt plans. In addition, Daryl Hall and Jon Secada also gave musical performances.|$|E
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{properties of}} <b>a</b> generic <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> (football) {{under the influence}} of various velocity and spin conditions was first measured using wind tunnel experiments and the conditions were also simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on a non-spinning ball of exactly the same geometry. For the wind tunnel experiments, a third scale model of <b>a</b> generic <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> (complete with <b>a</b> typical seam pattern) was used as well as a 'mini-football' (roughly half the size of <b>a</b> standard <b>soccer</b> <b>ball).</b> It was found that as the wind speed was increased, the drag coefficient decreased from 0. 5 to 0. 2, suggesting a transition from laminar to turbulent behaviour in the boundary layer. For spinning balls, the Magnus effect was observed and it was found that reverse Magnus effects were possible at low Reynolds numbers. Measurements on spinning smooth spheres found that laminar behaviour lead to a high drag coefficient for a large range of Reynolds numbers and Magnus effects were unstable, but generally showed reverse Magnus behaviour at high Reynolds number and spin parameter. The CFD simulations of the generic <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> revealed details of the near-ball air flow field and complex flow separation zones. Good agreement with experimental drag measurements from the wind tunnel was achieved for both fully turbulent and fully laminar flow conditions for the non-spinning ball. Further CFD studies are suggested to delineate the underlying spinning ball flow features...|$|R

50|$|In geometry, the Order-7 {{truncated}} triangular tiling, {{sometimes called}} the hyperbolic soccerball, is a semiregular tiling of the hyperbolic plane. There are two hexagons and one heptagon on each vertex, forming a pattern similar to <b>a</b> conventional <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> (truncated icosahedron) with heptagons in place of pentagons. It has Schläfli symbol of t{3,7}.|$|R
25|$|The flag of Saudi Arabia {{bears the}} shahada or Islamic {{declaration}} of faith. Because the shahada is considered holy, Saudi Arabia's flag code is extremely strict {{and even the}} slightest violation amounts to desecration {{not only of the}} flag but is also blasphemous to Islam. This has led to several incidents of controversy. In 1994, McDonald's printed carry-out bags bearing the flags of all nations participating in the FIFA World Cup (with a green flag with Saudi Arabia's coat of arms superimposed, rather than the Saudi flag), while Coca-Cola did the same on cans of soda. Because of Saudi outrage, the companies stopped producing those items. Also during the FIFA World Cup, in 2002, Saudi officials protested against printing the flag on <b>a</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> on the belief that kicking the creed with the foot was totally unacceptable.|$|E

Another official NBC site, dundermifflininfinity.com, created a Flash game inspired by the episode, in which the viewer attempts to kick <b>a</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> past Jim in the office parking lot and hit Phyllis in the face.|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} lenses that detonated {{with the proper}} shape and {{velocity}} {{turned out to be}} slow, difficult and frustrating. Various explosives were tested before settling on composition B as the fast explosive and baratol as the slow explosive. The final design resembled <b>a</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>ball,</b> with 20 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal lenses, each weighing about [...] Getting the detonation just right required fast, reliable and safe electrical detonators, of which there were two for each lens for reliability. It was therefore decided to use exploding-bridgewire detonators, a new invention developed at Los Alamos by a group led by Luis Alvarez. A contract for their manufacture was given to Raytheon.|$|E
5000|$|A frame's {{terminals}} {{are already}} filled with default values, {{which is based}} on how the human mind works. For example, when a person is told [...] "a boy kicks a ball," [...] most people will visualize a particular ball (such as <b>a</b> familiar <b>soccer</b> <b>ball)</b> rather than imagining some abstract ball with no attributes.|$|R
50|$|In 1961 {{a member}} of the German Underwater Club (DUC) in Cologne, Ludwig von Bersuda, {{came up with the idea}} of an {{underwater}} ball game. Air-filled balls are not suitable for underwater games, as they are buoyant and always return to the surface. The first underwater ball was invented when Bersuda filled the ball with saltwater. Since the density of the ball was now greater than that of normal water, it no longer floated to the surface, but slowly sank to the bottom. The sink rate could, within certain limits, be controlled by the concentration of the salt solution. <b>As</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>balls</b> are too large to be practical, waterpolo balls are used.|$|R
50|$|During special events, the {{exterior}} of the dome has been decorated. For example, during the winter season, the dome has been wrapped in a large ribbon, and during the 2006 FIFA World Cup the dome became <b>a</b> large <b>soccer</b> <b>ball.</b> Throughout the park's Halloween events, the dome is decorated as a giant pumpkin, and renamed as Pumpkin Coaster.|$|R
