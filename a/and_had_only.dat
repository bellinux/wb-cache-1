5|$|At the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, {{research}} into implosion had been proceeding under Seth Neddermeyer, but his division {{had worked with}} cylinders and small charges, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> produced objects that looked like rocks. Their research was accorded a low priority, owing to expectations that a gun-type nuclear weapon design would work for both uranium-235 and plutonium, and implosion technology would not be required.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to expectations, the American bombing effort had not {{pulverized}} the Base Areas <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> {{tended to}} drive PAVN and the NLF {{deeper into the}} Cambodian countryside. This series of events began to pose questions for Hanoi. The North Vietnamese {{had been willing to}} maintain the status quo in Cambodia as long as their supply lines and sanctuaries were secure. But with the expansion of the war across the border they might have to take further steps to maintain their position.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne {{closed its}} season against Fordham, who {{had yet to}} win a conference game <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> won two games all season. Fordham was hungry for a win, {{and a lack of}} {{effective}} defense on both sides led to a high scoring 111–100victory for Duquesne. Melquan Bolding and Eric Evans both posted career high scores of 32 and 23, respectively.|$|E

5|$|During {{his primary}} victories, McGovern used an {{approach}} that stressed grassroots-level organization while bypassing conventional campaign techniques and traditional party power centers. He capitalized on support from anti-war activists and reform liberals; thousands of students engaged in door-to-door campaigning for him. He benefited by the eight primaries he won being those the press focused on the most; he showed electoral weakness in the South and industrial Midwest, and actually received fewer primary votes overall than Humphrey <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> a modest edge over Wallace.|$|E
5|$|Gagak Item was {{released}} in late 1939 and was screened in Batavia (now Jakarta), {{the capital of the}} Indies; Medan, North Sumatra; and Surabaya, eastern Java. Some screenings of the film, also advertised under the Dutch title De Zwarte Raaf, had Dutch-language subtitles. A novelisation of the film, published by the Yogyakarta-based Kolff-Buning, soon followed. Gagak Item was one of four domestic productions released in 1939; the film industry had undergone a significant downturn following the onset of the Great Depression, during which time cinemas mainly showed Hollywood productions, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> begun recovering following the release of Terang Boelan.|$|E
5|$|Inside the case, {{there were}} many more {{similarities}} with the ZX81. Like its successor, it used the Z80A microprocessor <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> 1KB of on-board RAM. It came with a specially written BASIC interpreter on a dedicated ROM chip and could use a television as a display. It relied on an ordinary cassette tape recorder for data storage. The main {{difference between the two}} machines lay in the internal software; when the ZX81 was released, ZX80 owners were able to upgrade by the relatively simple expedient of plugging a new ROM onto the circuit board.|$|E

5|$|Later in Acts, Peter preached {{the gospel}} to the {{household}} of Cornelius the Centurion, a gentile. While he preached, the Holy Spirit {{fell on the}} gentiles, {{and they began to}} speak in tongues. The Jewish believers with Peter were amazed, and the household was water baptized. While the apostle Paul was in Ephesus, he found disciples there and discovered {{that they did not know}} of the existence of the Holy Spirit <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> received John the Baptist’s baptism. After baptizing them in Jesus’ name, Paul laid his hands on them, and they began to speak in tongues and prophesy.|$|E
5|$|Llywelyn Fawr and {{his successors}} made the church wealthy, giving it land. This {{was taken away}} {{at the time of}} the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536 but the church survived. The priory was in decline before 1536 in any event, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> the Prior and two other members at that time.|$|E
5|$|On Friday, May 14, the Syrian 1st Infantry Brigade, {{commanded}} by Colonel Abdullah Wahab el-Hakim, was in Southern Lebanon, positioned to attack Malkia. That day Hakim {{was ordered to}} return to Syria, move south across the Golan and enter Palestine south of the Sea of Galilee through Samakh (Tzemah). He began to advance at 9:00 AM on Saturday <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> two of his battalions, where the soldiers were already exhausted.|$|E

5|$|Spears {{talked to}} CNN about her {{involvement}} {{during the development}} of the tour, stating that she had designed the entire tour herself, including costumes and concept. Spears worked with fashion designer Gia Ventola to create the costumes for her and the dancers. The proscenium stage was simple <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> one main prop, a staircase in the middle. The band was in both sides of the staircase and consisted of five musicians. There were also six dancers, that took the stage during interludes. The setlist consisted of eight songs from her debut album and several covers by well-known artists.|$|E
5|$|The crime gained {{national}} notoriety for the particularly brutal way {{in which}} Pryce was murdered, only metres from his own home, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> his Oyster card and mobile phone taken from him, but no money (the case being widely reported {{as an example of}} steaming). The murderers were later tracked down when the police examined CCTV footage of where the Oyster card was used after the murder. The crime caused a political uproar and condemnation of railway station security. The Tom ap Rhys Pryce Memorial Trust was set up after the murder, and a school was built in his honour.|$|E
5|$|While {{the pair}} {{continued}} {{to express their}} positive feelings for one another, tabloids began writing the opposite. There were claims that the two bore ill will against each other, {{and that they had}} to record the song separately due to constant tension. While media speculation grew as the film's release date drew near, both singers maintained that they had become close friends, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> the most positive things to say about each other.|$|E

5|$|A {{collision}} with Edmonton's Dan McGillis {{early in the}} 1997–98 season forced Gélinas out of the lineup with a sprained knee. He missed 16 games due to the injury <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> eight points in 24 games played. His tenure with the Canucks ended January 3, 1998. He was traded, along with Kirk McLean to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for Sean Burke, Geoff Sanderson and Enrico Ciccone. Gélinas was added to Carolina's roster to add a physical presence to the team and improve the team {{at both ends of}} the ice. He finished the season with 24 points in 40 games with the Hurricanes, and was invited to join Team Canada for the 1998 World Championship. Gélinas scored one goal for the sixth-place Canadians.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} attribute in {{this dog}} was a tempered aggressiveness {{that would provide}} the necessary drive to pursue and bolt the fox, without resulting in physical harm to the quarry and effectively ending the chase, which was considered unsporting. Russell {{was said to have}} prided himself that his terriers never tasted blood. This line of terriers developed by John Russell was well respected for those qualities, and his dogs were often taken on by hunt enthusiasts. It is unlikely, however, that any dogs alive today can be proven to be descendants from Trump, as Russell was forced to sell all his dogs {{on more than one occasion}} because of financial difficulty, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> four aged (and non-breeding) terriers left when he died in 1883.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{cash from}} Rothschild, {{the company could}} not raise {{sufficient}} investment to begin construction of the Oxford extension, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> been given a five-year window by Parliament in which to build it. On 7 August 1888, {{less than two weeks}} before the authorisation was to expire, the directors of the Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company received Royal Assent for a revised and cheaper version. To be called the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad (O), the new scheme envisaged the extension's being built to the same light specifications as the existing tramway. To avoid expensive earthworks and tunnelling, the line would parallel a road out of Brill, despite the considerable gradients involved. The entire route would be single track, other than passing places, and the Oxford terminus was to be in George Street, nearer the edge of the city. Jones was sceptical and felt that it unlikely to recoup its construction costs.|$|E

5|$|Hannah's planned three-year term as Chief of the Air Staff was {{cut short}} by some ten months when he {{accepted}} an offer to serve as Governor of Queensland, becoming the first officer in the RAAF to receive a vice-regal appointment. The announcement was made in January 1972, and he took office on 21March. He succeeded Sir Alan Mansfield. Hannah {{did not have a}} strong connection with Queensland {{at the time of his}} appointment, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> lived in the state during his period as commander of RAAF Station Amberley between 1949 and 1951. He claimed not to have actively sought the governorship, and was criticised for failing to consult with senior colleagues before making his decision to retire early from his position as head of the Air Force. He was replaced as CAS by his deputy, Air Vice Marshal (later Air Marshal Sir) Charles Read.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Geetha starts an {{investigation}} when she realises {{that her son}} has gone missing. After a preliminary investigation, Geetha calls Rambabu and his family in for questioning. Rambabu, predicting that this would happen, coaches his family on how to present their alibi. As a result, when questioned individually, their responses are consistent. They also produce the restaurant receipt, the movie tickets and the tickets of the bus journey as proof of their alibi. The statements {{of the people who}} own the establishments that the family visited in Vizianagaram further solidify Rambabu's alibi. However, after a thorough investigation, Geetha realises that Rambabu had acquired the tickets and the receipt {{on the day of the}} incident, made an acquaintance with the owners, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> actually taken the trip a day later with his family.|$|E
5|$|Mengele and the Stammers {{bought a}} house {{on a farm in}} Caieiras in 1969, with Mengele as half owner. When Wolfgang Gerhard {{returned}} to Germany in 1971 to seek medical treatment for his seriously ill wife and son, he gave his identity card to Mengele. The Stammers had a falling out with Mengele in late 1974 and {{bought a house}} in São Paulo; Mengele was not invited. The Stammers bought a bungalow in the Eldorado neighbourhood of São Paulo, which they rented out to Mengele. Rolf, who had not seen his father since the ski holiday in 1956, visited him there in 1977 and found an unrepentant Nazi who claimed he had never personally harmed anyone <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> done his duty.|$|E
