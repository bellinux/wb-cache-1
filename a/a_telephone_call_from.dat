By this time, Serb officers and soldiers were also deserting in significant numbers.|$|E
5|$|Just before 05:00, as his rebels {{continued}} their search, Major Hatanaka {{went to the}} NHK studios, and, brandishing a pistol, tried desperately to get some airtime to explain his actions. A little over an hour later, after receiving <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> the Eastern District Army, Hatanaka finally gave up. He gathered his officers {{and walked out of}} the NHK studio.|$|E

5|$|Ewbank {{learned of}} the {{television}} problems {{in the locker room}} when he received <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> his wife congratulating him on a Jets victory – Lucy Ewbank assumed the fact {{that the end of the}} game was not shown meant New York had won. Her husband profanely informed her of the game result. She was not the only Jets relative deceived – cornerback Johnny Sample flew back east after the game on personal business, and when his father picked him up at Philadelphia International Airport, he congratulated his son on a Jets triumph.|$|E
5|$|Galland {{received}} <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> Göring on 10 May 1941, requesting Galland {{to intercept}} a Messerschmitt Bf 110 flown by Rudolf Hess heading for Scotland. Galland {{was unable to}} launch a full fighter sweep. However, Hess' flight was far {{to the north and}} he reached Scotland crashing his aircraft. Galland sent out fighters to conduct some sweeps so he could honestly claim to have carried out his orders but it was nearly dark and Galland ordered his pilots unused to night flying to stand down.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three days Marseille's Staffel was rested and taken off flying duties. On 28 September Marseille {{received}} <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel asking to return with him to Berlin. Hitler was to make a speech at the Berlin Sportpalast on 30 September and Rommel and Marseille were to attend.

Marseille also said he wanted to take leave at Christmas, to marry his fiancée Hanne-Lies Küpper.|$|E
5000|$|Sata {{received}} <b>a</b> congratulatory <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> his U.S. counterpart Barack Obama.

6000|$|... "That {{does not}} matter," [...] was the grave reply. [...] "Ten minutes ago I had <b>an</b> urgent <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> our mutual friend. His Excellency {{told me that}} he was sending a special messenger, and begged me to give you a few minutes. I have left a conference of some importance, and I am here." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{case against}} Martin falters as {{evidence}} disappears and witnesses fail to identify {{him in a}} line-up. Black is approached by Pepper, Martin's self-appointed lawyer, who extends Black an invitation to join his legal practice. Martin later claims in court to have killed Bletcher. Elsewhere, another Millennium Group member, Mike Atkins (Robin Gammell), receives <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> someone pretending to be Black. Meanwhile, Black suspects that the occult-oriented murder may have been committed to draw the Group, and Black, into the open again.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{argued that}} Bamber {{had not received}} <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> his father, that Nevill was too badly injured after the first shots to have spoken to anyone, {{that there was no}} blood on the kitchen phone that had been left off the hook, and that Nevill would have called the police before calling Bamber. They also argued that, had Bamber really received such a call, he would have dialled 999, alerted the farm workers, then made his way quickly there himself.|$|E
5|$|About 20minutes {{after the}} first step, Aldrin joined Armstrong {{on the surface and}} became the second human to set foot on the Moon, and the duo began their tasks of {{investigating}} how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Early on, they unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight, and also planted the flag of the United States. The flag used on this mission had a metal rod to hold it horizontal from its pole. Since the rod did not fully extend, and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze. Shortly after their flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> his office. The President spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.|$|E
50|$|He {{was also}} {{well known for}} his alter-ego that he created in the 1970s known as Fred C. Dobbs. Dobbs {{first came to the}} public's {{attention}} when <b>a</b> daily <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> crotchety commentator enlivened the Bruno Gerussi network radio program. In the mid-to-late 1970s, Magee starred in a series for Toronto's TVOntario called Magee & Company, in which he played numerous characters, including Dobbs.|$|R
50|$|On 2 December 2016, as president-elect, he {{accepted}} <b>a</b> congratulatory <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen. That {{was the first}} such contact with Taiwan by a U.S. president-elect or president since 1979 and provoked the People's Republic of China to lodge a diplomatic protest ("stern representations"). Trump suggested he didn't feel bound by America's traditional 'one China' policy but considered it open to negotiation.|$|R
5000|$|Since 2014, Doubleday's {{sculpture}} {{has been}} {{one of a series of}} [...] "Talking Statues" [...] across London where passers-by can receive <b>a</b> simulated <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> the statue's subject by scanning a QR code or visiting a link. The Holmes statue is voiced by the actor Ed Stoppard with a script written by the English novelist Anthony Horowitz which humorously gives details relating to the statue's appearance.|$|R
5|$|After {{a couple}} of months pondering his future career plans, he {{received}} <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> the Stockport County chairman, Victor Bernard, who offered him the position of general manager. Stockport was a struggling lower league club with a small budget, and Trautmann's appointment was an attempt to improve its image. Many people in the local area supported one of the two Manchester clubs, so to stimulate interest Trautmann and Bernard decided to move matches to Friday evenings, when neither Manchester club would be playing. This improved revenue, but the team continued to struggle. Trautmann resigned in 1966 following a disagreement with Bernard. From 1967 to 1968, he was the manager of the German team Preußen Münster, taking them to a 13th-place finish in the Regionalliga West, following which he had a short spell at Opel Rüsselsheim.|$|E
5|$|Employees of ANA {{believed}} the container had last {{been used to}} drain fuel from the cross-feed drain cock, the fuel cock that serves the pipe in the wing centre-section for cross-feeding of fuel from tanks in one wing to engines in the other wing. Moments after this procedure commenced, the staff member was advised of <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> his wife {{and he went to}} answer the telephone. With the cross-feed selector valves closed, little fuel ran out when the drain cock was opened. Some employees believed that because no fuel was running out neither the staff member nor anyone else noticed the drain cock was still open. Due either to the wind or the slipstream from Amana's propellers as it began to taxi prior to take-off, the almost-empty container was blown over and rolled some distance along the apron where it was found the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert surveils Watts, {{finding that}} the latter has {{been in contact with}} Means. Black travels to where Means is living, where he {{remotely}} observes a cult-like ceremony in which Means is ritually inducted into the Group. He contacts Watts, divulging the results of his tests—they were injected with a vaccine while quarantined. Black warns Watts that the Group is dangerous; Watts neither confirms nor denies this, but predicts the arrival of an earthquake, urging Black that should this prediction come to pass, he should accept full membership of the Group. That night, Black answers <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> Means, who tells him that the Group mean no harm. The line suddenly cuts, and the tremors of an earthquake begin just as Watts had predicted. Black moves through his home, noticing that his pet bird is dead in its cage, covered in blood.|$|E

A number of their album covers have been created by international surrealist artist J. Karl Bogartte (Chicago Surrealist Group), whose work, among other places, is {{in the collection of}} the Milwaukee Art Museum.|$|R
25|$|Michaela Farkasova, {{the wife}} of the sole {{surviving}} passenger, reported that she received <b>a</b> cellular <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> her husband, Martin Farkaš.

Cheela does Walters in and departs the lab, leaving Beth and Dorothy unharmed.|$|R
5|$|Lam Wing-kee (林榮基, age 60), {{the founder}} of Causeway Bay Books, has been missing since 24 October 2015. He habitually spent long hours at the {{bookshop}} and occasionally slept there. His wife filed a missing persons report with the police on 5 November and his family received <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> him several hours later; he refused to reveal his whereabouts. When filing the police report, they were referred to the Immigration Department, who said it was against privacy policy to reveal a person's records of entry and exit of Hong Kong without the subject's permission. However, legislator James To {{said this was a}} reasonable request that was exempt from privacy policy. Police followed up on his case once, asking whether they had heard from him. His family allege that upon learning that he had contacted his family, the officer who called them informed that the case would be closed as resolved.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{is driven}} back to Area 51 {{along with two}} other Men in Black, Howard Grodin and Jeff Smoodge. After an angry {{telephone}} call from Fletcher's wife, Joanne, Mulder—still inside Fletcher's body—goes to Fletcher's home. Instead of sleeping in the bedroom, he decides to sleep downstairs in an easy chair and watch pornography. When he is awoken by Joanne, he mumbles Scully's name. While changing his clothes, Mulder receives <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> Smoodge, who explains that the military has surveyed {{the wreckage of the}} craft from the night before, finding one of the human pilots merged into a rock but still alive. Another soldier, Captain Robert McDonough, had switched bodies with an elderly Hopi woman, as evident from McDonough's aberrant behavior.|$|E
5|$|On 5 August 1939, Wick married Ursel Rolfs (1916–1968) in Berlin. The {{marriage}} {{produced two}} children, Walter (born in October 1939) and a girl, Sabine, born after Wick's death, in February 1941. On 23 January 1941, Wick's father received <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> Karl Bodenschatz at the Führer Headquarters that Helmut Wick had been rescued and taken prisoner of war. Apparently an official Reuters report had {{indicated that a}} 25-year-old Luftwaffe Major, credited with 56 aerial victories, had been interned in a prisoner-of-war camp in Canada. Both Hitler and Göring initiated steps to get confirmation of the report. On 5 February 1941, a telegram from Ottawa informed Ursel that Wick was not interned in Canada. Ursel married the military doctor, Stabsarzt (equivalent to captain) Dr. Gerhard Tausch, later in the war.|$|E

50|$|Newer phones {{may also}} allow the {{tracking}} {{of the phone}} even when turned on and not active in <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call.</b> This results <b>from</b> the roaming procedures that perform hand-over of the phone from one base station to another.|$|R
5000|$|Anthony Eastwood is {{suffering}} from writer's block with a commission from an editor. He has typed a title - [...] "The Mystery of the Second Cucumber", hoping that it will give him some inspiration but to no avail.

She begs for his help to avoid being killed, gives him an address to go to and tells him the codeword is [...] "cucumber".|$|R
5|$|The Croatian {{government}} was criticised for {{its approach to}} the battle. Surviving defenders and right-wing political parties accused it of betrayal and of deliberately sacrificing Vukovar to secure international recognition for Croatia. The only explanation that many people were willing to accept for the town's fall was {{that it had been}} given up as part of a conspiracy. The commanders of the Croatian forces in Vukovar, Mile Dedaković and Branko Borković, both survived the battle and spoke out publicly against the government's actions. In an apparent attempt to silence them, both men were briefly detained by Croatian military police, and the Croatian government suppressed an issue of the newspaper Slobodni tjednik that published a transcript of <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> Vukovar, in which Dedaković had pleaded with an evasive Tuđman for military assistance. The revelations caused public outrage and reinforced perceptions that the defenders had been betrayed.|$|E
5|$|The series {{opens with}} Jerry Seinfeld (Jerry Seinfeld) and George Costanza (Jason Alexander) seated at Pete's Luncheonette, debating the {{placement}} of one of George's shirt buttons. Jerry tells George about a woman he met in Lansing, Michigan, Laura (Pamela Brull), who is coming to New York, and the two discuss {{whether or not she}} has romantic intentions. The next evening, Jerry tells his neighbor Kessler (Michael Richards) that he thinks he misunderstood the situation with Laura. However, he then receives <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> Laura, who asks if she can stay overnight at his apartment. Though Jerry agrees, he is still unsure whether or not her visit is intended to be romantic. George and Jerry continue to debate the issue, with Jerry determined to find the true nature of her visit.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{interviews}} Hurley about a {{video of}} Laura and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle); Hayward had denied him being present {{the day it was}} taken but Cooper notices a reflection of his motorcycle in the video. Cooper confronts Hurley about the affair he was having with Palmer, and about her cocaine habit. Hurley admits seeing Palmer the night she died but denies killing her. James' uncle Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) comes to the sheriff's department to pick his nephew up. Ed tells Truman that he was drugged the previous night at The Roadhouse, the town's bar; he suspects bartender Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) was responsible. Cooper takes <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> his colleague Albert Rosenfield, who {{is on his way to}} aid the investigation. Meanwhile, Briggs and his friend Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger) are in a jail cell, discussing money they owe to Leo. The $10,000 they were meant to pay him is in a safe deposit box owned by Palmer, which they can now no longer access. They are later released by Cooper, who warns them not to approach James Hurley.|$|E
6000|$|It was heralded by <b>a</b> tearful <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> Miss Wilbur, who rang up Ruth {{with the}} {{agitated}} information that [...] "Bailey didn't {{seem to like}} it." [...] And {{on the heels of}} the message came Bailey in person, pink from forehead to collar, and almost as wrathful as he had been on the great occasion of his first visit to the studio. His annoyance robbed his speech of its normal stateliness. He struck a colloquial note unusual with him.|$|R
5000|$|Later in the evening, Borynski {{received}} <b>a</b> second <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> man speaking Polish. Borynski {{was heard}} by his Polish housekeeper {{to speak in}} short, clipped sentences during the <b>call,</b> different <b>from</b> his normal cheerful disposition. Borynski said [...] "Now this has come, I go", and left his lodgings at Little Horton Lane wearing an overcoat and hat, which he rarely did on a summer's evening. Borynski left his wallet and personal papers at the house, and had 10 shillings on his person.|$|R
50|$|Tommy {{returns to}} Montana, and Michael's parents, Glenn and Jacy, are upset when {{they learn about}} his neglect. They later learn about his {{automobile}} accident and determine that the appropriate disciplinary action is to have him work on his aunt Jules' ranch in Montana for a month. If Michael's parents get <b>a</b> negative <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> the Biggs regarding him, they intend to cancel his upcoming trip with Gina to the French Riviera. Michael arrives at the ranch, where he meets Jules' ranch hands, Twister and Mule, as well as Tommy.|$|R
