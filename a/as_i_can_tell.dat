[...] "I don't want to rot, I want to {{live and}} think <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> To <b>tell</b> you the truth, Paret, I've been wishing to talk to you--I'm glad you came in." ...|$|R

2500|$|Since {{the enemy}} began to {{attack on the}} main island of Okinawa, the Army and the Army devoted {{themselves}} to defensive warfare and could hardly {{look back on the}} prefecture's people.

2500|$|Mr. Justice Eady's ruling states that, [...] "The views or {{conclusions}} of the GMC disciplinary body would not, so far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> be relevant or admissible", that Channel 4's allegations [...] "go to undermine fundamentally the Claimant's professional integrity and honesty", and that, [...] "It cannot seriously be suggested that priority {{should be given to}} GMC proceedings for the resolution of issues." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, Searle gave a {{brief reply}} to Derrida in The Construction of Social Reality. He called Derrida's {{conclusion}} [...] "preposterous" [...] {{and stated that}} [...] "Derrida, as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> {{does not have an}} argument. He simply declares that there is nothing outside of texts..." [...] Searle's reference here is not to anything forwarded in the debate, but to a mistranslation of the phrase [...] "il n'y a pas de hors-texte" [...] ("there is no outside-text") which appears in Derrida's Of Grammatology (1967).|$|E

[...] "I {{am not so}} much married <b>as</b> that, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you!

"Blanchard {{has made}} a point of calling Champion an 'opera in jazz' rather than a 'jazz opera', and <b>as</b> best <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> the {{distinction}} speaks to his eagerness to use the entire panoply of jazz's musical resources to tell this tale.

2500|$|In 2008, the 50th {{anniversary of}} Buechner's ordination, Rich Barlowe wrote of Buechner in the Boston Globe, [...] "Who knows? The words are Frederick Buechner's mantra. Over {{the course of}} an hourlong chat with the writer and Presbyterian {{minister}} in his kitchen, they recur any number of times in response to questions about his faith and theology. Dogmatic religious believers would dismiss the two words as the warning shot of doubt. But for Buechner, it is precisely our doubts and struggles that mark us as human. And that insight girds his theological twist on Socrates: The unexamined human life is a lost chance to behold the divine." [...] In 2002, Richard Kauffman interviewed Buechner for The Christian Century upon the publication of Speak What We Feel (Not What We Ought to Say). Buechner answered the question [...] "Do you envision a particular audience when you write?" [...] by saying [...] "I always hope to reach people who don't want to touch religion with a ten-foot pole. The cultured despisers of religion, Sehleiermacher called them. Maybe some of my books reach them. But most of my readers, as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> aren't that type. Many of them are ministers. They say, 'You've given us something back we lost and opened up doors we didn't think could be opened for people.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics have disputed Ehrlich's main thesis about {{overpopulation}} and {{its effects}} on the environment and human society, and his solutions, {{as well as some of}} his specific predictions made since the late 1960s. One criticism concerns Ehrlich's allegedly alarmist and sensational statements and inaccurate [...] "predictions". Ronald Bailey of Reason Magazine has termed him an [...] "irrepressible doomster... who, as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> has never been right in any of his forecasts of imminent catastrophe." [...] On the first Earth Day in 1970, he warned that [...] "n ten years all important animal life in the sea will be extinct. Large areas of coastline will have to be evacuated because of the stench of dead fish." [...] In a 1971 speech, he predicted that: [...] "By the year 2000 the United Kingdom will be simply a small group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million hungry people." [...] "If I were a gambler," [...] Professor Ehrlich concluded before boarding an airplane, [...] " [...] I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000." [...] When this scenario did not occur, he responded that [...] "When you predict the future, you get things wrong. How wrong is another question. I would have lost if I had had taken the bet. However, if you look closely at England, what can I tell you? They're having all kinds of problems, just like everybody else." [...] Ehrlich wrote in The Population Bomb that, [...] "India couldn't possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maggie Stands Looking {{was one of}} Captain Pratt’s model students. Maggie {{dictated}} {{this letter}} to an interpreter for publication: [...] "Carlisle Barracks, PA, Jan. 24, 1881. My dear father: AMERICAN HORSE:- I {{want to tell you}} something, and it makes me feel very glad. You tell me that my brother is married and that makes me feel very glad. My cousins, and brothers, and I are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would like to see you again. I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> <b>Tell</b> Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and tell me if you can come again, when. I {{want to tell you that}} some more girls and boys came here. Twenty-five. Fifteen of them are girls. There are a great many of us here now, and Capt. Pratt is very kind to us. That is all I want to say now. Give my love to all of my friends. Your daughter, Maggie Stands-Looking." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jaci Stephen {{from the}} Daily Mail praised the casting of Essex in the role, saying, [...] "There {{is always a}} frisson of {{excitement}} when a big star joins a soap. [...] None, however, has excited {{me as much as}} the arrival of David Essex in EastEnders. It is inspired casting, not only because the part of Eddie Moon fits Essex like a glove, but because he brings a gravitas to the show. And those eyes. Goodness, those beautiful eyes." [...] Stephen went on to positively review Eddie's arrival, saying, [...] "It made for a great start to the week, with David Essex's exquisite comic timing bringing some light-hearted relief to the rather heavy Moon/Mitchell stuff of late." [...] Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror also positively reviewed Eddie's arrival in Albert Square, saying, [...] "Dressed in a smart, black three-piece whistle and flute [...] and a white button-down collar shirt, the dapper grey-haired man looks like he could have been a guest at a Big, Fat Gypsy Wedding. But within four minutes of arriving in Albert Square on Monday, he's been knocked over by Carol's car as he snatches Roxy's toddler Amy from its path. Although there have been reports that this newcomer has been banned from singing in the Vic, within 15 minutes he's croaking out a line from the Leyton Orient supporters' song. This is the grand entrance of former 70s teen idol David Essex" [...] Conversely, Jim Shelley, also from the Daily Mirror, criticised Eddie's arrival, saying, [...] "on Monday they blessed us with the arrival of Whispering David Essex as Eddie Moon, the latest example of the Long-Lost Relative Who Has Never Been Mentioned Before that is routine in soaps nowadays. [...] Eddie had been in EastEnders three whole minutes before the writers unleashed the bi-annual cliche of The Mean & Moody New Guy Saving A Child Running Out In Front Of A Car. [...] Eddie spent the week ticking off the components of that great EastEnders cliche, the 'rough diamond'/silver-tongued 'ladies' man.' (See also Dennis Watts, Michael Moon, Johnny Allen, Max & Jack Branning, Steve Owen et al.)" [...] A reporter from the Metro called the character [...] "mischievous", and another from the Evening Chronicle called him [...] "a pleasant, charming character", adding [...] "It seems as if a little bit of Essex will brighten up the East End for a while. [...] s far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> [...] will be {{a breath of fresh air}} in a soap that sometimes forgets to have a laugh." ...|$|E
