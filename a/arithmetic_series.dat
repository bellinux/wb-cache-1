We show that the arithmetic degree of the pullback to Cal C of the arithmetic theta function of weight 3 / 2 valued in ĈH^ 1 () can be expressed as a linear combination of arithmetic theta functions of weight 1 for C and unary theta series. This identity can be viewed as an arithmetic seesaw identity. In addition, we show that the <b>arithmetic</b> theta <b>series</b> of weight 1 coincide with the central derivative of certain incoherent Eisenstein series for SL(2) /Q, generalizing earlier joint work with M.

40|$|Computing {{only the}} low degree {{terms of the}} product of two {{univariate}} polynomials is called a short multiplication. A global algorithm for short multiplications, independent of the actual (full) multiplication algorithm used, is proposed and its performance for several multiplication algorithms is studied. Computing the quotient of two polynomials is called a short division. The ideas used in the short multiplication algorithm are applied to develop an algorithm for short divisions. Finally, several applications of short multiplications and divisions are pointed out.

We also compute the motivic Igusa Poincare series Q_{geom}(T) for toric surface singularities, using the change of variables formula for motivic integrals, thus answering a second question of Lejeune-Jalabert and Reguera's.
