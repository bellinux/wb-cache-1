5|$|Antibody {{tests in}} {{children}} younger than 18months are typically inaccurate due to the continued presence of maternal antibodies. Thus HIV infection can only be diagnosed by PCR testing for HIV RNA or DNA, or via testing for the p24 antigen. Much of the world lacks access to reliable PCR testing and many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or the child is old enough for accurate antibody testing. In sub-Saharan <b>Africa</b> <b>as</b> of 2007–2009 between 30 and 70% of the population were aware of their HIV status. In 2009, between 3.6 and 42% {{of men and women}} in Sub-Saharan countries were tested which represented a significant increase compared to previous years.|$|E
5|$|As Italy {{entered the}} war at the {{conclusion}} of the Battle of France, their Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini looked to <b>Africa</b> <b>as</b> a possible location for easy propaganda victories to justify his joining the conflict and to glorify Italy's hitherto speculative role it. The British Somaliland colony, a weakly defended area located in modern Somalia, looked to the dictator easy prey. Despite Italy being logistically unready for a conflict in that region, an attack on Somaliland was authorized, set for late 1940. Italian forces in East Africa were relatively strong in numbers, if not in quality, with 29 colonial brigades, each consisting of several infantry battalions and some light artillery, concentrated around the recently conquered Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. The Italians also possessed at least 60 medium and light tanks and 183 aircraft, both fighters and medium/light bombers.|$|E

5|$|Biko saw white {{racism in}} South <b>Africa</b> <b>as</b> {{the totality of}} the white power structure. He argued that under apartheid, white people not only participated in the oppression of black people but were also the main voices in {{opposition}} to that oppression. He thus argued that in dominating both the apartheid system and the anti-apartheid movement, white people totally controlled the political arena, leaving black people marginalised. He believed white people were able to dominate the anti-apartheid movement because of their access to resources, education, and privilege. He noted that white South Africans were poorly suited to this role because they had not personally experienced the oppression that their black counterparts faced.|$|E

He later commanded the third, fourth and eighth contingents, becoming the first New Zealand officer to command an independent unit on active service overseas. Following his return to New Zealand, he became inspector-general of the New Zealand Military Forces, and in 1909 was attached to a British Army brigade to gain staff experience.|$|E

However, according to historian Mike Green, the tanks were never issued to combat units.|$|E
