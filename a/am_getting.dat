500|$|In 1890 {{the prince}} gave up dancing, telling his son George that [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> {{too old and}} fat for these amusements"; he {{replaced}} dancing with other pursuits, like attending the opera and playing baccarat. He enjoyed baccarat so much that when he travelled he brought a set of leather counters, valued on one side from five shillings to £10 and engraved with his feathers on the other; the counters had been a present from his friend Reuben Sassoon, {{a member of the}} well-known banking family.|$|E

Vitiligo or lighter skin?" [...] Noting that Jackson had even skin tone when he was younger, Lipkin's interpretation was that [...] "probably he's trying to look Caucasian: His skin is whiter. His nose <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> thinner every six months. His lips <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> thinner. His eyebrows <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> higher. His eyes <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> wider every time. His cheekbones <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> bigger." ...|$|R
500|$|In Frankfurt she met {{and married}} a white German man named Alexander. Her family and his {{attended}} the wedding, but several incidents illustrated once again how German society treated her as [...] "invisible". When she and Alexander went to get their marriage license, the registrar greeted Alexander, wrote down his name, and then asked [...] "Where is the bride?" [...] As they were descending the courthouse steps after their wedding, a passerby offered wedding congratulations to the maid of honor. She ignored the incidents even though [...] "I am troubled by this continual need {{to point out to}} others that it is I who <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> married." [...] After six years she and Alexander divorced.|$|E
500|$|Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 3 {{out of a}} {{possible}} 4 stars and called the film good, despite noting the almost-typical superhero background. Of the actors, he stated that Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner were suitable for their roles, while Michael Clarke Duncan's presence alone was menacing. He said, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> a little worn out describing the origin stories and powers of superheroes [...] Some of their movies, like this one, are better than others." [...] The Houston Chronicles Bruce Westbrook considered it [...] "the best Marvel movie to date, it's as well-written and character-driven as some of today's Oscar contenders, and its story doesn't stall with hollow flamboyance." [...] The Austin Chronicles Kimberly Jones praised the film, the actors, and felt that though an unproven director, [...] "Johnson has just signed his meal ticket with this marriage of big brains, big brawn, and–most happily–big heart." ...|$|E
500|$|At one point, {{shooting}} {{was to take}} place at a bridge overlooking the Detroit River, which was frozen at the time. The script, however, called for clear and running water, meaning that the crew had to brave dangerously low temperatures and conditions to clear the ice; finally they blew up the ice with dynamite. At another time, the crew spent a week filming on a Detroit street after dark, directly under a nursing home, with huge wind machines blowing for long hours. One evening a glass bottle with a note in it crashed to the ground from an upper floor. The note inside read, [...] "The noise is keeping me awake all night long and I <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> sick. I am dying because of you." [...] John Cameron, second assistant director on the film, would later remark, [...] "I see Crimewave as a real turning point in a certain way, because if you survived that experience, nothing in the business could ever be as hard again." [...] Raimi cited the experience {{as one of the}} least favorite moments of his career.|$|E

500|$|Within {{the day of}} the song's release, via World Wide Web, listeners, {{unaware of}} the song's background, drew {{comparisons}} of the song to Sa-Fire's [...] "I Never Heard." [...] Soon after, media outlets The New York Times and TMZ.com informed Anka of the similarities between the songs. In response, Anka told the New York Times, that [...] "This Is It" [...] was [...] "exactly the same song" [...] as [...] "I Never Heard" [...] and only the titles were different. He also stated that he was planning on taking legal action against Jackson's estate. Soon afterwards, Jackson's estate acknowledged that Anka was a co-writer on the song and agreed that Anka would receive 50 percent of the publishing rights from it. Anka said the estate [...] "did the right thing," [...] and that he felt that he did not think [...] "that anybody tried to do the wrong thing [...] " [...] and it was [...] "an honest mistake." [...] Anka further stated [...] "They realize it's a mistake, they realize it's my song, they realize it's my production of his vocal in my studio and I <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> 50 percent of the whole project, actually, which is fair." ...|$|E
500|$|By January 1956 {{the author}} Ian Fleming had {{published}} three novels—Casino Royale in 1953, Live and Let Die in 1954 and Moonraker in 1955. A fourth, Diamonds Are Forever, was being edited {{and prepared for}} production. That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write From Russia, with Love. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] He returned to London in March that year with a 228-page first-draft manuscript that he subsequently altered more heavily than any of his other works. One of the significant re-writes changed Bond's fate; Fleming had become disenchanted with his books and wrote to his friend, the American author Raymond Chandler: [...] "My muse is in a very bad way... I <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> fed up with Bond and it has been very difficult to make him go through his tawdry tricks." [...] Fleming re-wrote {{the end of the novel}} in April 1956 to make Klebb poison Bond, which allowed him to finish the series with the death of the character if he wanted. Fleming's first draft ended with Bond and Romanova enjoying a romance. By January 1957 Fleming had decided he would write another story, and began work on Dr. No in which Bond recovers from his poisoning and is sent to Jamaica.|$|E

I see no change in New York and I <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> very tired indeed, of sinking twenty-five thousand dollars a year for nothing here in the East."

I don't like people who become like 'actor slash singer.' I think people should be one or the other because usually you're not going to be great at both.

2500|$|In 1890, Indians named [...] "No Neck" [...] and [...] "Black Heart" [...] {{testified in}} an inquiry before the Office of Indian Affairs. [...] The hearing weighed the {{morality}} of Indian employment in show business. [...] "You are engaged in the exhibition or show business," [...] observed the acting commissioner, A.C. Belt. [...] "It is not considered among white people a very helpful or elevating business. [...] I believe that which {{is not good for}} the white people is not good for the Indians, and what is bad for the white people is bad for the Indians." [...] The Indians defended their work as adamantly as any white performer, and they turned the inquiry into a pointed denunciation of the Indian policy by comparing conditions in the show with those of the Pine Ridge Agency. [...] The contrast reflected poorly on the Office of Indian Affairs. Rocky Bear began by pointing out that he long had served the interests of the federal government (Great White Father) by encouraging the development of Indian reservations. [...] He worked in a show that fed him well; [...] "that is why I <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> so fat," [...] he said, stroking his cheeks. [...] It was only in returning to the reservation that [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> poor." [...] If the Great [...] Father wanted him to stop appearing in the show, he would stop. [...] But until then, [...] "that is the way I get money." [...] When he showed his inquisitors a purse filled with $300 in gold coins, saying [...] "I saved this money to buy some clothes for my children," [...] they were silenced. [...] Black Heart, too, denounced the allegations of mistreatment. [...] "We were raised on horseback; that is the way we had to work."
