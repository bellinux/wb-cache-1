5|$|The Battle of Porton Plantation {{ended in}} defeat for the Australians, as the landing was repulsed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> {{remained}} {{in possession of}} the beachhead. Amidst a campaign where largely the Australians dominated – {{it was the only}} defeat – the battle represented a shift in momentum in the northern sector, which was in part due to the shift in resources south, a fact which continued to impact Australian operations in the sector {{until the end of the}} war. During the course of the landing and the subsequent withdrawal, the Australians suffered 23 killed or missing, presumed dead, and 106 wounded, while the Japanese lost 26 killed. Both sides seem to have overestimated the casualties that they inflicted, with the Australians believing that they had killed between 147 and 197 Japanese, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> estimating Australian losses to have been around 60 killed and 100 wounded.|$|E

5|$|Authors and {{military}} analysts {{have speculated that}} had Kingsbury not attacked, the Japanese might have destroyed the battalion.
