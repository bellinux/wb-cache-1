40|$|A novel, to our knowledge, two-step digit-set-restricted {{modified}} signed-digit (MSD) addition-subtraction {{algorithm is}} proposed. With {{the introduction of}} the reference digits, the operand words are mapped into an intermediate carry word with all digits restricted to the set {(1) over bar, 0 } and an intermediate sum word with all digits restricted to the set { 0, 1 }, which can be summed to form the final result without carry generation. The operation can be performed in parallel by use of binary logic. An optical system that utilizes an electron-trapping device is suggested for accomplishing the required binary logic operations. By programming of the illumination of data arrays, any complex logic operations of multiple variables can be realized without additional temporal latency of the intermediate results. This technique has a high space-bandwidth product and signal-to-noise ratio. The main structure can be stacked to construct a compact optoelectronic MSD <b>adder-subtracter.</b> (C) 1999 Optical Society of America...|$|E

In order to apply this model to robot vision or various intelligent vision systems, its VLSI implementation with high performance and {{low power consumption}} is required. This paper proposes a convolutional network VLSI architecture using a hybrid approach composed of pulse-width modulation (PWM) and digital circuits. We call this approach merged/mixed analog-digital architecture. The VLSI includes PWM neuron circuits, PWM/digital converters, digital <b>adder-subtracters,</b> and digital memory. We have designed and fabricated a VLSI chip by using a 0. 35 �m CMOS process. The VLSI chip can perform 6 -bit precision convolution calculations for an image of 100 ¢ 100 pixels with a receptive field area of up to 20 ¢ 20 pixels within 5 ms, which means a performance of 2 GOPS. Power consumption of PWM neuron circuits {{is estimated to be}} 20 mW. We have verified successful operations using a fabricated VLSI chip. ...|$|R
40|$|Applications {{based on}} Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) such as signal and image {{processing}} require high computational power, plus {{the ability to}} choose the algorithm and architecture to implement it. This paper explains the realization of a Split Radix FFT (SRFFT) processor based on a pipeline architecture reported before by the same authors. This architecture has as basic building blocks a Complex Butterfly and a Delay Commutator. The main advantages of this architecture are: • To combine the higher parallelism of the 4 r-FFTs {{and the possibility of}} processing sequences having length of any power of two. • The simultaneous operation of multipliers and <b>adder-subtracters</b> implicit in the SRFFT, which leads to faster operation at the same degree of pipeline. The implementation has been made on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) as a way of obtaining high performance at economical price and a short time of realization. The Delay Commutator has been designed to be customized for even and odd SRFFT computation levels. It can be used with segmented arithmetic of any level of pipeline in order to speed up the operating frequency. The processor has been simulated up to 350 MHz, with an EP 2 S 15 F 672 C 3 Altera Stratix II as a target device, for a transform length of 256 complex points...|$|R
