50|$|A {{candidate}} {{must submit}} a project or thesis or dissertation often {{consisting of a}} body of original academic research, which is in principle worthy of publication in a peer-reviewed context. In many countries a candidate must defend this work before <b>a</b> <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> examiners appointed by the university; in other countries, the dissertation is examined by <b>a</b> <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> examiners who stipulate whether the dissertation is in principle passable and any issues {{that need to be}} addressed before the dissertation can be passed.|$|R

5|$|The Teesside coroner held an inquest on 12 October 2008 {{that found}} that the finds were {{treasure}} trove {{under the terms of}} the Treasure Act 1996. The rules of treasure trove require that <b>a</b> <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> determine the market value of a find, half of which is paid to the finder and the other half to the landowner. However, the landowner at Street House waived his share because he wanted to ensure that a local museum would be able to purchase the artefacts. The Heritage Lottery Fund provided Kirkleatham Museum with a grant of £274,000 to fund the purchase and create a new Anglo-Saxon gallery to display the artefacts.|$|E
5|$|However, the court's {{role was}} to rule on whether {{publication}} was legal, not whether it was wise. In keeping with the usual practice of keeping {{a temporary restraining order}} in effect for as short a time as possible, Warren ordered that hearings be held on a preliminary injunction in one week's time, on March 16. At the request of both parties, this was postponed to March 26 so they would have time to file their briefs and affidavits. The parties were therefore back in court again on March 26 for a hearing on the government's request for a preliminary injunction. Warren decided not to hold an evidentiary hearing at which the opposing teams of experts could be cross examined. He also declined a suggestion by the Federation of American Scientists in its amicus curiae brief that <b>a</b> <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> be charged with examining the issue. The case relied on written affidavits and briefs, and the opposing counsels' oral arguments.|$|E
5|$|With {{the failure}} to defeat the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain, the {{proposed}} invasion of the UK was postponed indefinitely on 17 September 1940. This meant the British merchant fleet would not be at Germany's disposal for use in evacuations, and planning for the Madagascar proposal stalled. In late August 1940, Rademacher entreated Ribbentrop {{to hold a meeting}} at his ministry to begin drawing up <b>a</b> <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> to consolidate the plan. Ribbentrop never responded. Likewise, Eichmann's memorandum languished with Heydrich, who never approved it. Establishment of ghettos in Warsaw and other cities in Poland resumed in August 1940. Hitler continued to mention the plan until February 1942, when the idea was permanently shelved. British Empire forces took the island from Vichy France in the Battle of Madagascar in November 1942 and control was transferred to the Free French.|$|E
