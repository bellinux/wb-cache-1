She wrote in October 1916 {{about the history of}} the moving picture industry in a multiple-article series, beginning her account with a retelling of Eadweard Muybridge's action photograph of Governor Leland Stanford's racehorse named Occident. She defined this high-speed image <b>as</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> the development of moving pictures.|$|E
5|$|The {{book has}} also become popular among {{political}} leaders and those in business management. Despite its title, The Art of War addresses strategy in a broad fashion, touching upon public administration and planning. The text outlines theories of battle, but also advocates diplomacy and the cultivation of relationships with other nations <b>as</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> {{the health of a}} state.|$|E
5|$|Hatfield was {{a popular}} Governor who {{supported}} Oregon's traditional industries of timber and agriculture, but felt that in the postwar era expansion of industry and funding for transportation and education needed to be priorities. While governor he worked to begin the diversification of the state's economy, such as recruiting industrial development and holding trade missions. As part of the initiative, he helped to found the Oregon Graduate Center {{in what is now}} the Silicon Forest in Washington County in 1963. A graduate level school in the Portland area (Portland State was still a college with no graduate programs at this time) was seen by business leaders <b>as</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> attracting new industries and by Tektronix as needed to retain highly skilled workers. In lieu of the standard portrait for former governors, Hatfield is represented by a marble bust at the Oregon State Capitol.|$|E

5|$|It is, as an Upanishad, {{a part of}} {{the corpus}} of Vedanta {{literature}} that presents the philosophical concepts of Hinduism. The Varaha Upanishad emphasizes that liberation from sorrow and fear requires a human being to know the non-dualistic nature of existence, oneness between Self, Brahman and Vishnu, and the role of Yoga in self-liberation, and lists ten Yamas (virtues) <b>as</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> a liberation of one's soul: nonviolence, satya, asteya, brahmacharya, compassion, rectitude, kshama, non-hypocrisy, mitahara, and shaucha. The text describes the Jivanmukta as one whose inner state, amongst other things, is neither affected by happiness nor by suffering inflicted on him, who does not shrink out of fear from the world, nor the world shrinks from him with fear, and whose sense of calm and inner contentment is free from anger, fear, and joy toward others.|$|E
5|$|The Gospel of the Hebrews is {{the only}} Jewish–Christian gospel which the Church Fathers refer to by name. The {{language}} of composition {{is thought to be}} Greek. The provenance has been associated with Egypt; it probably began circulating in Alexandria, Egypt in {{the first decades of the}} 2nd century and was used by Greek-speaking Jewish–Christian communities there. The communities to which they belonged were traditional, conservative Christians who followed the teaching of the primitive Christian church in Jerusalem, integrating their understanding of Jesus with strict observance of Jewish customs and law, which they regarded <b>as</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> salvation. Despite this, the gospel displays no connection with other Jewish–Christian literature, nor does it appear to be based on the Gospel of Matthew or the other canonical gospels of what is now orthodox Christianity. Instead, it seems to be taken from alternative oral forms of the same underlying traditions. Some of the fragments suggest a syncretic gnostic influence, while others support close ties to traditional Jewish Wisdom literature.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of SEATO members were not located in Southeast Asia. To Australia and New Zealand, SEATO {{was seen as}} a more satisfying organization than ANZUS – a collective defense organization with the U.S. The United Kingdom and France joined partly due to having long maintained colonies in the region, and partly due to concerns over developments in Indochina. Pakistan, however, was simply interested in joining over the appeal of potential support for its long struggle against India. Last but not least, the U.S. upon perceiving Southeast Asia to be a pivotal frontier for Cold War geopolitics saw the establishment of SEATO <b>as</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> its Cold War containment policy.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} a unified East Asia took form based on an Imperial Japanese Army concept that {{originated}} with General Hachirō Arita, an army ideologist who served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1936 to 1940.

25|$|Involuntary {{annexation}} is {{a controversial}} issue in {{those parts of}} unincorporated Bexar County affected by it. Residents attracted to the outlying areas by lower taxes and affordable real estate values, often see annexation as a mechanism to increase property tax rates (which are primarily driven by school district taxes, not city taxes) without a corresponding improvement in services such as police and fire protection, while the city regards its annexation policy <b>as</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> its overall prosperity.|$|E
25|$|A {{recording}} which showcases Rachmaninoff's {{approach is}} the Liszt Second Polonaise, recorded in 1925. Percy Grainger, who had {{been influenced by the}} composer and Liszt specialist Ferruccio Busoni, had himself recorded the same piece a few years earlier. Rachmaninoff's performance is far more taut and concentrated than Grainger's. The Russian's drive and monumental conception bear a considerable difference to the Australian's more delicate perceptions. Grainger's textures are elaborate. Rachmaninoff shows the filigree <b>as</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> the work's structure, not simply decorative.|$|E
