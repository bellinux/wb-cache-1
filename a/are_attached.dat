5|$|The spores are {{elliptical}} or , smooth, translucent (hyaline), with {{dimensions of}} 4.5–5.5 by 2–2.5µm. The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> to 6–8 sessile spores.|$|E
5|$|If {{appropriate}} {{electrical contacts}} <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> to a nanotube, electron-hole pairs (excitons) {{can be generated}} by injecting electrons and holes from the contacts. Subsequent exciton recombination results in electroluminescence (EL). Electroluminescent devices have been produced from single nanotubes and their macroscopic assemblies. Recombination appears to proceed via triplet-triplet annihilation giving distinct peaks corresponding to E11 and E22 transitions.|$|E
5|$|Like other insects, {{cockroaches}} breathe {{through a}} system of tubes called tracheae which <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> to openings called spiracles on all body segments. When the carbon dioxide level in the insect rises high enough, valves on the spiracles open and carbon dioxide diffuses out and oxygen diffuses in. The tracheal system branches repeatedly, the finest tracheoles bringing air directly to each cell, allowing gaseous exchange to take place.|$|E

50|$|Gathering is {{a sewing}} {{technique}} for shortening {{the length of}} a strip of fabric so that the longer piece can <b>be</b> <b>attached</b> to a shorter piece. It is commonly used in clothing to manage fullness, as when a full sleeve <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> to the armscye or cuff of a shirt, or when a skirt <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> to a bodice.|$|R
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{undergo a}} range of posttranslational modifications, when additional chemical groups <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> to the amino acids in proteins. Some modifications can produce hydrophobic lipoproteins, or hydrophilic glycoproteins. These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid palmitic acid to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes.|$|E
5|$|Mayan {{languages}} {{have two}} sets of affixes that <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> to a verb to indicate the person of its arguments. One set (often referred to in Mayan grammars as set A) indicates the person of subjects of intransitive verbs, and of objects of transitive verbs. They {{can also be used}} with adjective or noun predicates to indicate the subject.|$|E
5|$|Stiffening laths, if used, <b>are</b> <b>attached.</b> Both {{horn and}} laths may be bound and glued with further lengths of sinew. After months of drying the bow {{is ready for}} use.

5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{surrounded}} by a fatty capsule and lie within the renal fascia, which also surrounds the kidneys. A weak wall of connective tissue called septum separates the glands from the kidneys. The adrenal glands are directly below the diaphragm, and <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> to the crura of the diaphragm by the renal fascia.|$|E
5|$|The possessive determiners (analogous to English my, his, etc.) {{are used}} to {{indicate}} the possessor of the noun they determine. They mark the person and number of the possessor, and are inflected {{to agree with the}} noun they <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> in number and case. While the English language distinguishes between masculine and feminine singular possessors (his vs. her), late Quenya generally does not.|$|E
5|$|Two {{antennae}} ("feelers") <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> to the head; these organs detect chemicals, air currents, and vibrations; {{they also}} are used to transmit and receive signals through touch. The head has two strong jaws, the mandibles, used to carry food, manipulate objects, construct nests, and for defence. In some species, a small pocket (infrabuccal chamber) inside the mouth stores food, {{so it may be}} passed to other ants or their larvae.|$|E

5|$|X-ray diffraction, {{electron}} diffraction, and {{neutron diffraction}} give {{information about the}} structure of matter, crystalline and non-crystalline, at the atomic and molecular level. In addition, they <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> to the properties of all materials, inorganic, organic or biological. Due to the diffraction importance and variety of application of diffraction by crystals, {{a large number of}} Nobel Prizes were presented to studies involving X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Adult Lepidoptera {{have two}} pairs of {{membranous}} wings covered, usually completely, by minute scales. A wing consists of an upper and lower membrane which are connected by minute fibres and strengthened by a system of thickened hollow ribs, popularly but incorrectly referred to as 'veins', as they may also contain tracheae, nerve fibres and blood vessels. The membranes are covered with minute scales which have jagged ends or hairs and <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> by hooks. The wings are moved by the rapid muscular contraction and expansion of the thorax.|$|E
5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) {{defended the}} NWA World Tag Team Championship against Team Canada (Eric Young and Petey Williams), who were {{accompanied}} by A-1, in a Six Sides of Steel Strap match next. It lasted 14 minutes even. In a strap match, wrestlers <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> by a strap {{for the duration of}} the match, but they mainly used it as a weapon. AMW retained the titles after forcing Williams into the mat by performing their signature maneuver, the Death Sentence.|$|E
50|$|Most {{prostheses}} can <b>be</b> <b>attached</b> to {{the exterior}} of the body, in a non-permanent way. Some others however can <b>be</b> <b>attached</b> in a permanent way. One such example are exoprostheses (see below).|$|R
2500|$|Sensors {{have been}} made using QD as [...] donors and a small {{molecule}} or gold nanoparticle (dark quencher) as acceptors.

50|$|General Lek and General Vellajally {{attacked}} Firozabad in 1802. In {{the beginning}} of British regime Firozabad was in Etawah district but after some time it <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> to Aligarh district. When Sadabad was created as a new district in 1832, Firozabad <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> to it. Later on, in 1833 Firozabad <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> to Agra district. In 1847, the business of lac was flourishing at Firozabad.|$|R
5|$|Barnacles are {{normally}} sessile animals unable to evade predators. When they <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> to a scallop they {{benefit from the}} defence response of the mollusc to threats which enables it to avoid predation. The scallop is disadvantaged because the presence of barnacles may reduce its ability to swim. It {{has been found that}} encrusting sponges emit chemicals that discourage barnacle larvae from settling nearby. The larvae preferentially settle on shells that are not encrusted with sponges. This is another way in which encrusting sponges are of advantage to the scallops which are less impeded in their ability to swim by sponges than they are by barnacles.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} speeds, large forces {{were applied to}} the {{aircraft}} during banks and turns, and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard elevons, varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> to the stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed. Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed. This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord can produce analgesia. First, the leads are implanted, guided by fluoroscopy and feedback from the patient, and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath {{the skin of the}} upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> to the snugly fitting generator. It seems to be more helpful with neuropathic and ischemic pain than nociceptive pain, but current evidence is too weak to recommend its use in the treatment of cancer pain.|$|E
