5|$|Lactarius vietus milk has <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>hot</b> taste, and the {{mushroom}} lacks a distinctive smell. Although described by many mycologists as inedible, David Pegler claims that its acrid taste {{can be removed}} after boiling, allowing it to be consumed. Though the strong, acrid taste is {{a defining feature of}} the species, it is weaker or even absent in some older mushrooms, which is not unusual for Lactarius species. Occasionally, however, mushrooms of the species have been collected which have a mild taste; this has also been observed in other species with typically acrid tastes.|$|E
5|$|The women {{worked from}} 8:30a.m. to 3:30p.m. daily – not long hours – but the working {{conditions}} were probably unbearable by modern standards. New Orleans has a warm, wet climate. The process of adjusting, however, required the utmost {{attention to the}} scales' balance, and the slightest draft could upset it. The draft could also carry off the silver dust from the coin planchets the women would file. For these reasons the windows and doors were almost always kept shut, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>hot</b> working environment. Workers relied on water coolers to provide relief {{from the heat and}} avoid dehydration. The women mint employees were judged to enjoy better working conditions than many other American women workers in the late nineteenth century.|$|E

25|$|Because {{of a mass}} {{emigration}} of Indian Surinamese in the 1970s, roti {{became a}} popular take-out dish in the Netherlands. It usually includes chicken curry, potatoes, a boiled egg and various vegetables, most notably the kousenband or yardlong bean. Another variation includes shrimp and aubergine. The meat with gravy, potatoes, egg and yardlong beans are served {{side by side on}} a plate, with the aloo puri folded in fours on top.

This was illegal and the story was leaked by The Age newspaper. The teams agreed to finish the match and England won by 128 runs after Frank Tyson took 7 for 27 in the final innings.|$|E
25|$|Meat can {{be cooked}} in boiling oil, {{typically}} by shallow frying, although deep frying may be used, often for meat enrobed with breadcrumbs as in milanesas. Larger pieces such as steaks may be cooked this way, or meat may be cut smaller as in stir frying, typically an Asian way of cooking: cooking oil with flavorings such as garlic, ginger and onions {{is put in}} <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>hot</b> wok. Then small pieces of meat are added, followed by ingredients which cook more quickly, such as mixed vegetables. The dish is ready when the ingredients are 'just cooked'.|$|E

25|$|The Sharks rode on <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>hot</b> {{streak in}} the month of March. They were aided by the trade-deadline {{acquisition}} of Brian Campbell, for whom they gave up Steve Bernier. Going the entire month without a regulation loss, the Sharks captured their third Pacific Division title with a franchise-record 108 points. San Jose started the 2008 playoffs beating the Calgary Flames four games to three in San Jose's first-ever Game 7 on home ice. San Jose eventually lost to the Dallas Stars in the Western Conference Semi-finals. Game 6 required four overtime periods, and was the longest game in the team's history. This was the Sharks third playoff loss to Dallas.|$|E
25|$|The Priorat DOQ {{has been}} {{producing}} wine since the 12th century when Carthusian monks planted a vineyard {{and established a}} priory from which the region took its name. The area {{is known for its}} Carinyena and Garnatxa based wines made from old, low yield vines that average 0.3 tons an acre (5 hl/ha). The area has <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>hot</b> Mediterranean climate that allows the grape to ripen fully and produce wines with very high alcohol levels of up to 18% and wines must have at least 13% to qualify for certification in the region. The local Llicorella soil is of particularly poor quality, composed of quartz and slate, which also helps to limit yields. Vineyards are situated on steep terraces, largely unsuitable for mechanical harvesting.|$|E
25|$|The 1980 {{eruption}} of Mount St. Helens {{was the most}} significant {{to occur in the}} contiguous 48 U.S. states in recorded history (VEI = 5, 0.3cumi, 1.2km3 of material erupted), exceeding the destructive power and volume of material released by the 1915 {{eruption of}} California's Lassen Peak. The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the mountain that created a huge bulge and a fracture system on Mount St. Helens' north slope. An earthquake at 8:32am on May 18, 1980, caused the entire weakened north face to slide away, suddenly exposing the partly molten, gas- and steam-rich rock in the volcano to lower pressure. The rock responded by exploding into <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>hot</b> mix of pulverized lava and older rock that sped toward Spirit Lake so fast that it quickly passed the avalanching north face.|$|E

25|$|A trial trip to Mapperley {{was made}} on 1 May on car 57. Apparently it was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>hot</b> day and {{the driver of the}} car said that much sand was needed to {{overcome}} the stickiness of the tar, which had melted and overflowed onto the rails from between the setts. The steepest gradient of the section was 1 in 11. Major Pringle, the Board of Trade inspector, duly inspected the approved route on 6 May and public service commenced a week later, on 13 May. This service operated via the Market Place to Trent Bridge every 12 minutes, alternating with a short working between Alexandra Park and Trent Bridge every 12 minutes. The fare between the Market Place and Mapperley was 2d., with intermediate 1d. stages. At first there was a stop on the outward journey at Cranmer Street, but this was discontinued early in 1903 because of the difficulty of restarting the cars, the hill being at its steepest at this point.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the first}} four months of 2015, Chattanooga became <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>hot</b> market for bank mergers with the merging of 3 locally owned banks, and 1 in nearby Cleveland, Tennessee. CapitalMark, formed in 2007, will be {{acquired}} by the Nashville-based Pinnacle Financial Partners for $187 million to have the fourth largest market share in the Chattanooga metro area. First Security Group, Inc, the largest Chattanooga-based bank, formed in 2000, will be acquired by the Atlanta-based Atlantic Capital Bancshares, Inc., for $160 million. Cornerstone, started in 1985, will merge with the Knoxville-based SmartBank in a stock deal. Cleveland's Southern Heritage Bank was acquired in 2014 by First Citizens National Bank in Dyersburg, Tennessee, for $32.2 million. All these mergers only leave one Chattanooga-based, independent bank, First Volunteer Bank. Others in the area locally based include Ringgold, Georgia-based Northwest Georgia Bank, Dunlap, Tennessee-based Citizens Tri-County Bank, Ooltewah-based Community Trust and Banking Co., Dayton, Tennessee-based Community National Bank, Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia-based Capital Bank, LaFayette, Georgia-based Bank of LaFayette, and Cleveland-based Bank of Cleveland.|$|E
25|$|Despite the tribulations {{created by}} the Second World War, Richmond was able to {{maintain}} a commendable level of consistency on the field. The club had {{quite a lot of}} players in reserved occupations who remained at home, while the administration became adept at securing star players who were temporarily in Melbourne on war service. Dyer was a fearsome presence in his role as playing coach, but he was unable to improve Richmond's ability to win finals matches. A loss in the 1942 VFL Grand Final to Essendon (after starting as favourite) meant that over the previous 18 years, Richmond had won two flags but been runner-up eight times. Jack Titus set a still unbeaten record of playing in six losing Grand Final teams. In 1943, Richmond broke through to beat Essendon in a thrilling Grand Final by five points, a win that the club dedicated to ex-player Bill Cosgrove, an RAF pilot who had been killed in action {{a few weeks before the}} match. But another Grand Final loss followed in 1944, when Dyer's team failed against Fitzroy on <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>hot</b> day.|$|E
