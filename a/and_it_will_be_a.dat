500|$|Don Turnbull {{reviewed}} Tomb of Horrors in issue No. 13 of {{the magazine}} White Dwarf, and gave the module a rating of 10 out of 10.

He felt that the illustration booklet would add {{a great deal to}} the adventure's atmosphere and felt that the pre-generated character roster was useful. Turnbull noted that the module is [...] "very hard and will be hard for the DM to learn in advance, though this is an essential prerequisite of running it properly for it is much more subtle than the G or D modules", and he said that this module has in common with those modules an [...] "excellent format, for instance, and the comprehensive way in which the scenario is introduced.

500|$|John Slattery, who {{was later}} cast as Roger Sterling, {{originally}} auditioned to portray Don Draper. Slattery felt Don was the show's biggest draw and was disappointed upon hearing of his character's sparse screen time.

And then they sort of said, 'Well, look, here’s the deal. We have a guy. The reason {{we asked you to}} come in and read for Draper is because we didn't think that you’d come in a read for Roger because there wasn’t that much Roger in the script.'" [...] During production of [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," [...] Slattery admitted he was unsure of whether to continue working on Mad Men. [...] "I was on the fence a little bit, even while shooting it. And I think Matt finally was like, 'Look man, we’re not jerking you around here. We’re serious about this and I’ve really thought this out. I promise you this will be a great character <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> big part of the show.'" ...|$|E
500|$|On 20 March 1976, Smith gave a {{televised}} speech including what became his most quoted utterance. [...] "I don't believe in majority rule ever in Rhodesia—not in 1,000 years," [...] he said. [...] "I repeat that I believe in {{blacks and whites}} working together. If one day it is white {{and the next day}} it is black, I believe we have failed <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> disaster for Rhodesia." [...] The first sentence of this statement became commonly quoted as evidence that Smith was a crude racist who would never compromise with the black nationalists, even though the speech was one in which Smith had said that power-sharing with black Rhodesians was inevitable and that [...] "we have got to accept that in the future Rhodesia is a country for black and white, not white as opposed to black and vice versa". The [...] "not in 1,000 years" [...] comment was, according to Peter Godwin, an attempt to reassure the RF's right wing, which opposed any transition whatsoever, that white Rhodesians would not be sold out. In her 1978 biography of Smith, Berlyn comments that regardless of whether the statement was [...] "taken out of context, or whether his actual intent was misinterpreted", this was one of his greatest blunders as Prime Minister as it gave obvious ammunition to his detractors.|$|E

2500|$|On June 2, 1949, Stevenson privately gave a sworn {{deposition}} as {{a character}} witness for Alger Hiss, a former State Department official who was later {{found to be a}} spy for the Soviet Union. Stevenson had infrequently worked with Hiss, first in the legal division of the AAA in 1933, and then in 1945, 1946, and 1947 on various United Nations projects, but he was not a close friend or associate of him. In the deposition, Stevenson testified that the reputation of Hiss for integrity, loyalty, and veracity was good. In 1950 Hiss was found guilty of perjury on the spying charges. Stevenson's deposition, according to his biographer Porter McKeever, would later be used in the 1952 presidential campaign by Senators Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon to [...] "inflame public opinion and attack Adlai as 'soft on communism'." [...] In the 1952 campaign, Senator Nixon would claim that Stevenson's [...] "defense of Hiss" [...] reflected such [...] "poor judgment" [...] on his part that [...] "doubt was cast about Adlai's capacity to govern." [...] In a 1952 appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, Stevenson responded to a question about his deposition for Hiss by saying [...] "I'm a lawyer. I {{think that one of the}} most fundamental responsibilities...particularly of lawyers, is to give testimony in a court of law, to give it honestly and willingly, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very unhappy day for Anglo-Saxon justice when a man, even in public life, is too timid to state what he knows and what he has heard about a defendant in a criminal trial for fear that defendant might later be convicted. That would to me be the ultimate timidity." ...|$|E
2500|$|The next {{controversy}} surrounding the lake followed the {{proposal for a}} fountain to be erected in the lake {{to coincide with the}} city's Golden Jubilee anniversary celebrations in 1936. For the mayor, it would be [...] "a miracle of engineering," [...] with the spray of water lit by virtually [...] "limitless combinations" [...] of colour. The public, in contrast, were not impressed by the proposal. Its $33,019.96 price tag was considered extremely frivolous {{in the midst of an}} economic crisis. As written in The Sunday Sun Edition of the Vancouver Sun Newspaper, Saturday, August 8. 1936. The lead story in the Magazine section is; SECRETS OF THE FOUNTAIN. It was the conception and idea of then, Chief Electrical Engineer, Robert Harold Williams with Hume and Rumble Ltd. electrical contractors. R.Harold Williams designed and supervised the erection of the Vancouver's Golden Jubilee fountain. After a business trip to Los Angeles he saw a fountain and thought this would be a great gift for the city for their up and coming birthday, Golden Jubilee celebration. To build the fountain, Lost Lagoon was drained. Seventy piles were driven into the mud. On these a concrete mat was laid. The fountain was built upon this mat. The work was of necessity rushed; it was done in a month. [...] "The fountain is worthy of all the traditions of art, worthy of Vancouver's Golden Jubilee, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> permanent, decorative joy in Stanley Park". [...] "When operating , it is like a symphony concert, in motion and color instead of music, says Harold Williams, engineer, of Hume & Rumble Ltd., under whose personal supervision the work has been done." [...] Vancouver's Jubilee Committee and private citizens who contributed are to be commended on their work in pushing for this beautiful fountain, which is sure to be one of the major attractions during the Golden Jubilee celebration. [...] "We've had to hurry," [...] says Mr. Williams," [...] in that time 285 tons of cement have been utilized and all the special equipment was built." [...] All equipment was built in Canada and the pumps were constructed in Vancouver. All union labor was employed. It was restored for Expo in 1986.|$|E
