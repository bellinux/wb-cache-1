25|$|Sherman and her coauthors {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} communications between the gay and lesbian veterans with their VHA providers and the experiences regarding their healthcare services. Most of them report dissatisfaction with their medical treatment. Many veterans state that they do not receive the necessary support from VHA medical providers. Moreover, they claim that their healthcare providers are not receptive to their medical needs, and they have never been asked about their sexual orientation. Most of the veterans report that they do not feel at ease with their healthcare providers. The results of the study also show that some gay and lesbian veterans are disinclined to seek medical treatment from the VHA, and some of them <b>are</b> <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> in finding equitable healthcare services. Based on the study, there are some inherent problems in the healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} his car, Martin felt the {{championship}} was an achievement {{that he was}} unable to secure: [...] "They tell me a lot of people <b>are</b> <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> anyway, but we didn't need to throw that away," [...] He said he was unaware that Yeley intended to make a pit stop and, from his viewpoint, it allowed Kenseth to pass him while Yeley was coming from the centre of the track. Yeley said the pit stop was planned and signalled his intentions to Martin for over a mile. He felt Martin placed him in a position to hit the backstretch wall. Hamlin said the first-lap crash that he was involved in was part of auto racing, and stated it was problematic being involved in difficulties in the Chase for the Nextel Cup: [...] "We checked up and somebody else (Waltrip) didn't. I put myself back there in qualifying. We'll take our lumps and go on." [...] Seventh-place finisher Raines was happy to hold the first position for 28 laps saying it was [...] "extra special" [...] to lead a race at Charlotte. Tom Bowles of Frontstretch opined that had the caution flag not been displayed for the three safety vehicles on lap nine, it could have resulted in [...] "one of the most disastrous accidents in NASCAR history." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011, the PBS program Need To Know cited a {{statement}} by Gary Samore, White House Coordinator for Arms Control and Weapons of Mass Destruction, in which he said, [...] "we're glad they [...] <b>are</b> <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> with their centrifuge machine and that we – the US and its allies – are {{doing everything we can}} to make sure that we complicate matters for them", offering [...] "winking acknowledgement" [...] of US involvement in Stuxnet. According to The Daily Telegraph, a showreel that was played at a retirement party for the head of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Gabi Ashkenazi, included references to Stuxnet as one of his operational successes as the IDF chief of staff.|$|E

2500|$|Medical tourism {{may raise}} broader ethical {{issues for the}} {{countries}} {{in which it is}} promoted. For example, in India, some argue that a [...] "policy of 'medical tourism for the classes and health missions for the masses' will lead to a deepening of the inequities" [...] already embedded in the health care system. In Thailand, in 2008 it was stated that, [...] "Doctors in Thailand have become so busy with foreigners that Thai patients <b>are</b> <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> getting care". Medical tourism centered on new technologies, such as stem cell treatments, is often criticized on grounds of fraud, blatant lack of scientific rationale and patient safety. However, when pioneering advanced technologies, such as providing 'unproven' therapies to patients outside of regular clinical trials, it is often challenging to differentiate between acceptable medical innovation and unacceptable patient exploitation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, after {{extensive}} testing, Borlaug's team, under Anderson, {{began its}} effort by importing about 450tons of Lerma Rojo and Sonora 64 semi-dwarf seed varieties: 250tons went to Pakistan and 200 to India. They encountered many obstacles. Their first shipment of wheat {{was held up}} in Mexican customs and so {{it could not be}} shipped from the port at Guaymas in time for proper planting. Instead, it was sent via a 30-truck convoy from Mexico to the U.S. port in Los Angeles, encountering delays at the Mexico - United States border. Once the convoy entered the U.S., it had to take a detour, as the U.S. National Guard had closed the freeway due to Watts riots in Los Angeles. When the seeds reached Los Angeles, a Mexican bank refused to honor Pakistan treasury's payment of US$100,000, because the check contained three misspelled words. Still, the seed was loaded onto a freighter destined for Bombay, India, and Karachi, Pakistan. Twelve hours into the freighter's voyage, war broke out between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir region. Borlaug received a telegram from the Pakistani minister of agriculture, Malik Khuda Bakhsh Bucha: [...] "I'm sorry to hear you <b>are</b> <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> with my check, but I've got troubles, too. Bombs are falling on my front lawn. Be patient, the money is in the bank..." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Free Application Federal Student Aid, {{also known}} as FAFSA, in 2013, over 58,000 {{students}} identified as homeless on their application. [...] "The federal government defines these unaccompanied homeless youth (UHY) as individuals {{who do not have}} [...] "fixed, regular and adequate" [...] housing and who are [...] "not in the physical custody of a parent or adult." [...] The McKinney Vento Act is considered the key piece of federal legislation pertaining to educational support for homeless children and teens. The causes of homelessness varies from student to student. There are two types of homeless college students: 1. students that are homeless upon entering college and 2. students who become homeless during college. For the youth that become homeless upon entering college, this situation represents the students that <b>are</b> <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> sustaining housing due to job loss of their parent or guardian, the lack of a parent or guardian or because youth has been asked to leave the home or decided to runaway. The reasons for a college youth to become homeless while attending college are as follows: unable to sustain the financial expenses for housing and food. Secondly, by having the financial support given by family revoked. Fortunately, there are programs available at state colleges and universities that provide students with the necessary resources to obtain financial and housing stability and sustainability. There are also organizations such as the National Association For The Education Of Homeless Children and Youth (NAEHCY) that advocate for a higher education so the children and youth can fulfil their dreams. Another innovative model that can be of great help to college students experiencing homelessness is Single Stop USA, which operates in community colleges to help connect low-income students to the resources they need, including housing, to not only stay in school but to excel ...|$|E
