6000|$|Let me ask the British {{reader who}} is {{disposed}} to sneer at the League of Nations {{and say he}} is very well content with the empire, thank you, to get his atlas and consider one or two propositions. And, first, let him think of aviation. I can assure him, because upon this matter I have some special knowledge, that long-distance air travel for men, for letters and light goods and for bombs, is continually becoming more practicable. But the air routes that air transport will follow must go over {{a certain amount of}} land, for this reason that every few hundred miles at the longest the machine must come down for petrol. A flying machine with a safe non-stop range of 1500 miles {{is still a long way}} off. It may indeed be permanently impracticable because there seems to be an upward limit to the size of an aeroplane engine. And now will the reader take the map of the world and study the air routes from London to the rest of the empire? He will find them perplexing--if he wants them to be [...] "All-Red." [...] Happily this is not a British difficulty only. Will he next study the air routes from Paris to the rest of the French possessions? And, finally, will he study the air routes out of Germany to anywhere? The Germans are as badly off as any people. But we are all badly off. So far as world <b>air</b> <b>transit</b> goes any country can, if it chooses, choke any adjacent country. Directly any trade difficulty breaks out, any country can begin a vexatious campaign against its neighbour's air traffic. It can oblige it to alight at the frontier, to follow prescribed routes, to land at specified places on those routes and undergo examinations that will waste precious hours. But so far as I can see, no European statesman, German or Allied, have begun to give their attention to this amazing difficulty. Without a great pooling of air control, either a world-wide pooling or a pooling at least of the Atlantic-Mediterranean Allies in one Air League, the splendid peace possibilities of air transport--and they are indeed splendid--must remain very largely a forbidden possibility to mankind.|$|E

50|$|Portugal was an {{official}} Allied Power in World War I, Portuguese troops {{were the first}} to be gassed by German soldiers, yet they received nothing after the Treaty of Versailles. In World War II, Prime Minister António de Oliveira Salazar was committed to the six-century-old treaty (which had been renewed in 1899). Portugal provided assistance not by declaring war but by helping Spain stay neutral and by assuming a co-belligerent status against Germany by leasing air bases in the Azores to the Allies in 1943. It cut off vital shipments of tungsten to Germany in 1944, after heavy Allied pressure.

50|$|The public bus systems {{which had}} {{replaced}} the local and interurban streetcars were operated by public service companies, and were dependent upon passenger fares. As ridership plummeted {{in the second half}} of the century, urban-suburban bus lines began to fail financially. By the early 1970s, only a few suburban lines were left, notably including Bon <b>Air</b> <b>Transit</b> Company extending to the suburb of Bon Air in Chesterfield County and Fairfield Transit Company, extending to Seven Pines in eastern Henrico County. The inner city company, Virginia Transit Company, was converted to become the government-owned Greater Richmond Transit (GRTC) in 1972. Privately owned commuter operators gradually discontinued services; the last privately owned suburban public route service was the Mechanicsville Bus Line route, which ended in June 2004.|$|E

50|$|Portugal {{was officially}} neutral in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39), but quietly {{furnished}} {{help to the}} nationalists of Francisco Franco. During the Second World War (1939-45), Portugal remained officially neutral, but the regime had more pro-Axis sympathies; Salazar even expressed support for the German invasion of the Soviet Union. This support, however, can be mainly attributed to Salazar's staunch anti-communist position rather than actual support for Hitler, or the Nazi regime. From 1943, Portugal favoured the Allies, leasing air bases in the Azores. After polite advances made by the Allies, Portugal leased the Azores {{as a result of}} being threatened with invasion should Portugal not cater to the requests of the Allies. Portugal traded with both sides, but cut off vital shipments of tungsten and rubber to Germany in 1944, after heavy pressure from the Allies.

50|$|Russia {{announced}} plans to create a NATO transit hub in Ulyanovsk in March 2012. The decision sparked protests in the city which is the birthplace of Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin. In late June 2012 Russia approved ground and <b>air</b> <b>transit</b> of NATO goods over its territory from Afghanistan. An order signed by Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and dated 25 June 2012 allows the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to move their consignments, including some types of weapons and military hardware, from and to Afghanistan via a Russian base in the Airport Ulyanovsk Vostochny by rail, road and air, {{in contrast with the}} previous permission, which sanctioned only ground transit. But the order imposes a list of conditions, including customs clearance, availability of official certificates and other requirements which ensure the goods' transparency on Russia's territory. Moscow has been considering allowing NATO to use Ulyanovsk Air Base only for the transit of non-lethal cargos to and from Afghanistan. The planned agreement however stirred a wave of criticism and protests in Russia, with many being strongly opposed to what they consider a “NATO base” on Russian soil. But high-ranking Moscow officials insisted according to Russian TV network RT that no NATO military base or the presence of the alliance’s civil and military personnel is intended, but only civilian logistics facilities.|$|E

5000|$|The {{debris from}} the {{destroyed}} Ark fleet now forms an artificial [...] "Ark belt" [...] in Earth orbit, which periodically rains down in small-scale [...] "Arkfalls", which present a hazard for survivors on the surface, but also provide valuable opportunities to salvage advanced technology aboard the Arks. More frequently, most of the debris breaks up on re-entry into shards of metal shrapnel, a dangerous phenomenon known as [...] "razor rain". Electromagnetic distortion created by the malfunctioning Votanformers have rendered most long-distance communication and <b>air</b> <b>transit</b> impossible, isolating far-flung regions much {{as they would have}} been isolated in the 19th century. Low-flying aircraft such as helicopters are still safe to fly, and will still function, but high-altitude long-distance flights are too dangerous; neither the humans nor the Votans are capable of launching vehicles into Earth's orbit anymore, as it is not only dangerous, but prohibitively expensive for societies that only just managed to pull themselves back from complete collapse. Fifteen years after the armistice, a new proposed maglev train line is being built with the goal of re-establishing regular transit between the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America. Short-range radio stations will still function within the localized area of a town, as will personal smartphone-like devices known as hailers, but otherwise, the disruption of long-range telecommunications means that information must be sent between different regions by courier. At best, an unreliable method known as [...] "text relay" [...] can be used, in which local radio-stations rebroadcast a message received from a neighboring station to reach other regions of the continent, but this can take days or weeks.|$|E
40|$|Recent work in <b>air</b> <b>transit</b> {{efficiency}} {{has increased}} en-route efficiency {{to a point}} that airport efficiency is the bottleneck. With the expected expansion of <b>air</b> <b>transit</b> it will become important {{to get the most out}} of airport capacity. Departure scheduling is an area where efficiency stands to be improved, but due to the complicated nature of the problem an optimal solution is not always forthcoming. A heuristic approach can be used to find a sub-optimal take-off order in a significantly faster time than the optimal solution can be found using known methods. The aim of this research is to explore such heuristics and catalog their solution characteristics. A greedy approach as well as a k-interchange approach were developed to find improved takeoff sequences. When possible, the optimal solution was found to benchmark the performance of the heuristics, in general the heuristic solutions were within 10 - 15 % of the optimal solution. The heuristic solutions showed improvements of up to 15 % over the first-in first-out order with a running time around 4 ms...|$|E
