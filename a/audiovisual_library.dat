The DVD included the score by Laura Rossi, an accompanying 1916 musical medley, a commentary by Roger Smither, a film archivist at the Imperial War Museum and interviews with Smither, Rossi, Toby Haggith (film archivist) and Stephen Horne (silent film musician) on {{the reconstruction of the}} contemporary medley; film fragments and missing scenes were also included in the DVD.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method for the {{classification}} of sound effects which exploits time-frequency analysis of audio signals and uses the hidden Markov model as the classifier. The proposed approach {{can be used to}} retrieve audio/video segments in studios, <b>audiovisual</b> <b>libraries,</b> and family entertainment applications. For example, video scenes of gun fight can be retrieved by searching for sounds of shooting or explosion. In addition, it will have applications in surveillance by recognizing sounds related to criminal activities. An accuracy rate of 86 % for sound effects classification is achieved with the proposed method. Also, a query-byexample retrieval approach for sound effects is proposed on top of the archiving scheme, which is proved to be highly efficient and effective. 1 Introduction Most research on audiovisual data segmentation and indexing has primarily focused on visual information, and very little work has been done on the analysis of its audio content, especially that of sound ef [...] ...|$|R
