40|$|AIM: To {{detect the}} {{prevalence}} of <b>anti-HAV</b> IgG antibodies in adult multitransfused beta-thalassemic patients. METHODS: We studied 182 adult beta-thalassemic patients and 209 controls matched for age and sex from the same geographic area, at the same time. <b>Anti-HAV</b> IgG antibodies, viral markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were evaluated. RESULTS: <b>Anti-HAV</b> IgG antibodies were detected more frequently in thalassemic patients (133 / 182; 73. 1 %) than in healthy controls (38 / 209; 18. 2 %, P < 0. 0005). When we retrospectively evaluated {{the prevalence of}} <b>anti-HAV</b> IgG antibodies in 176 / 182 (96. 7 %) thalassemic patients, whose medical history was available for the previous ten years, {{it was found that}} 83 (47. 2 %) of them were continuously <b>anti-HAV</b> IgG positive, 16 (9. 1 %) acquired <b>anti-HAV</b> IgG antibody during the previous ten years, 49 (27. 8 %) presented <b>anti-HAV</b> positivity intermittently and 28 (15. 9 %) were <b>anti-HAV</b> negative continuously. CONCLUSION: Multitransfused adult beta-thalassemic patients present higher frequency of <b>anti-HAV</b> IgG antibodies than normal population of the same geographic area.

Hepatitis A is an {{endemic disease}} in Brazil and Latin America. Prevalence of this infection {{is related to}} the low degree of hygiene and sanitation. In developing countries, inadequate sanitation results in larger transmission of the disease mostly in children and young people. Nowadays, due to better sanitation conditions, the epidemiological profile of disease is changing to older ages resulting in the occurrence of outbreaks. Diagnostic kits for detection of total <b>anti-HAV</b> generally use mammals immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the convalescent period of disease for production of capture and conjugated antibodies. One alternative to the application of mammals antibodies in the diagnosis is the use of immunoglobulin Y (IgY), encountered in birds and reptiles. These proteins have several advantages when compared to IgG: high response against mammals antigens, reduction of the background in imunoenzymatic assays and it is obtained by a non-invasive method (harvest of the egg yolks). The objective of this work was the acquisition of <b>anti-HAV</b> IgY antibodies produced in immunized chickens against Hepatitis A virus and the development of an immunoenzymatic assay for total <b>anti-HAV</b> detection using IgY <b>anti-HAV</b> as capture and conjugated immunoglobulins. Five groups of chickens were immunized with different inocula containing: vaccine with and without CpG-ODN adjuvant, HAV with incomplete Freund adjuvant (IFA) with and without CpG-ODN and one control group with IFA. The eggs were harvested and the yolk was purified by precipitation with polyethylene glycol. The purified solution containing <b>anti-HAV</b> IgY was evaluated by espectrofotometry and their specificity and title were determined by an immunoenzymatic assay.

While the national HAV vaccination program is largely associated with the shift of socioeconomic trend in the country, concerns have been raised on the effectiveness of the HAV immunization. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the epidemiological trend of HAV and assess the effectiveness of the nationwide HAV vaccination policy based on a nationally representative sample of the Korean population collected in 2015. We analyzed <b>anti-HAV</b> of 5, 856 respondents aged ≥ 10 years collected from Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data in 2015. We estimated age-adjusted <b>anti-HAV</b> prevalence by sociodemographic and other characteristics.

The prevalence of <b>anti-HAV</b> among adults aged ≥ 45 years was 97. 8 % (95 % CI 96. 0 - 97. 6). Factors significantly associated with <b>anti-HAV</b> positivity among those aged 10 - 19 years old were young age, higher house income and high influenza vaccination rate. Compared to the respondents aged 10 - 19 years (those who were subject to the national childhood vaccine recommendation), those aged 20 - 29 years (those who were not subject to the recommendation) had low adjusted odds ratio (OR, 0. 52 95 % CI 0. 34 -. 81 P-value = 0. 004) for <b>anti-HAV</b> positivity. The age-adjusted <b>anti-HAV</b> prevalence showed a U-shaped association, implying the high dependence of <b>anti-HAV</b> prevalence on age and the epidemiological shift. The inclusion of the hepatitis A vaccine into the national immunization recommendation was effective shown by the increase of immunity in the general population. However, the vaccination rate was low in the low-income group. Young adults aged 20 - 39 years may benefit from inclusion in the HAV vaccination program due to the significantly low vaccination rate...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the seroconversion rate of a hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccination in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) -related chronic liver disease (CLD). Methods: Analyses were conducted using clinical records from 94 patients with chronic HBV infection who were seronegative for IgG <b>anti-HAV</b> antibodies between September 2008 and June 2009. Two doses of an HAV vaccine were administered 24 weeks apart. A third vaccine dose was administered only for patients seronegative for <b>anti-HAV</b> antibodies at week 48. Results: The seroconversion rate of <b>anti-HAV</b> following the two-dose vaccination was 86. 17 %. The seroconversion rate of <b>anti-HAV</b> was not significantly different according to age or status of liver disease. The rate was higher in female than in male patients. A third HAV vaccine dose was administered to 13 patients seronegative for <b>anti-HAV</b> after the two-dose regimen, and 84. 62 % of these patients showed seroconversion at week 72. Conclusions: HAV vaccination is effective in most Korean patients with HBV-related CLD, and it might be necessary to evaluate three-dose vaccination approach for non-responders to the conventional regimen to maximize the success of an HAV vaccination program...|$|E
40|$|Immunoglobulin M (IgM) {{antibodies}} against hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) and hepatitis A virus (<b>anti-HAV)</b> {{were determined}} in 41 cases of acute viral hepatitis. In sera positive for anti-HBc or <b>anti-HAV,</b> IgM {{was separated from}} IgG by reorienting sucrose gradient high-speed centrifugation, and the IgG- and IgM-containing serum fractions were tested {{for the presence of}} specific antibody by radioimmunoassay. At the onset of illness, 4 of the 41 cases were classified as hepatitis A, 31 were hepatitis B, and 6 were non-A, non-B hepatitis, {{based on the results of}} these tests and of assays for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody and hepatitis B e antigen and antibody. Fourteen of these 41 patients (34 %) required IgM anti-HBc or IgM <b>anti-HAV</b> testing or both for appropriate classification. IgM anti-HBc persisted for at least 7 weeks after onset but no longer than 17 weeks in all patients tested with transient hepatitis B surface antigen-positive acute hepatitis. IgM <b>anti-HAV</b> persisted up to but not longer than 62 days in the patients with hepatitis A. Therefore, IgM anti-HBc and IgM <b>anti-HAV</b> determinants are valuable tools for the differential diagnosis of acute A, B, and non-A, non-B hepatitis...|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} of anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) antibody levels by diagnostic kits in the convalescent period of disease generally use immunoglobulin G (IgG), which is expensive. An alternative to IgG is immunoglobulin Y (IgY), an immunoglobulin antibody encountered in birds and reptiles. The {{aim of this}} study was to develop a competitive immunoenzymatic assay to measure total <b>anti-HAV</b> antibody levels using <b>anti-HAV</b> IgY as the capture and conjugated immunoglobulins. For this purpose, <b>anti-HAV</b> IgY was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and the optimal dilution of HRP-conjugated antibodies was evaluated to establish the competitive immuneenzymatic assay.

40|$|The {{epidemiologic}} {{shift of}} hepatitis A virus (HAV) {{infection in the}} South Korean population resulted in a peak outbreak of hepatitis in 2009. The {{aim of this study}} was to clarify the seropositivity of <b>anti-HAV</b> antibody (<b>anti-HAV)</b> and its demographic characteristics before and after the peak outbreak from 2005 to 2014. This retrospective study analyzed the <b>anti-HAV</b> data of all individuals from 1, 795 medical institutions referred to a major central laboratory from January 2005 through December 2014, as a sentineal tool for monitoring annual variation of <b>anti-HAV</b> positivity. The prevalence of <b>anti-HAV</b> was adjusted for age and area with the standard population based on the 2010 Census data. A total of 424, 245 individuals were included in this study. The overall age-adjusted <b>anti-HAV</b> prevalence decreased from 65. 6 % in 2005 to 62. 2 % in 2014. During the 10 -year period, the seroprevalence continuously decreased in persons aged 30 to 39 years (69. 6 % to 32. 4 %) and those aged 40 to 49 years (97. 9 % to 79. 3 %) due to the cohort effect. In contrast, it increased in persons aged 10 to 19 years (15. 4 % to 35. 2 %), while it was the lowest (8. 7 %) in 2010 before rebounding to 20. 2 % in 2014 in persons aged 20 to 29 years due to a vaccination effect. Although the HAV vaccination rate increased, the <b>anti-HAV</b> seropositivity in South Korea decreased from 65. 6 % to 62. 2 % in this study population. In particular, the immunity of young adults was still low, and an outbreak of HAV is possible in the near future. Therefore, continuous monitoring and optimal preventive measures to prevent future outbreaks should be considered...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a causative {{agent of}} acute hepatitis, which is {{transmitted}} by person-to-person contact and via the faecal-oral route. Acute HAV infection is usually confirmed by <b>anti-HAV</b> IgM detection. In order to detect <b>anti-HAV</b> IgM in the serum of patients infected with HAV, {{we developed a}} rapid assay based on immunochromatography (ICA) and evaluated the sensitivity of this assay by comparing it with a commercial microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) that is widely used for serological diagnosis. Results The newly developed ICA showed 100 % sensitivity and specificity when used to test 150 <b>anti-HAV</b> IgM-positive sera collected from infected patients and 75 negative sera from healthy subjects. Also, the sensitivity of ICA is about 10 times higher than MEIA {{used in this study}} by determining end point to detect independent on infected genotype of HAV. In addition, the ICA was able to detect 1 positive sample from among 50 sera from acute hepatitis patients that had tested negative for <b>anti-HAV</b> IgM using the MEIA. Conclusion Conclusively, ICA for the detection of <b>anti-HAV</b> IgM will be very effective for rapid assay to apply clinical diagnosis and epidemiological investigation on epidemics due to the simplicity, rapidity and specificity. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Hepatitis A virus {{infection}} is endemic {{in many developing}} countries including Bangladesh. Children infected with Hepatitis-A virus typically have asymptomatic disease. Objective: To observe the <b>anti-HAV</b> positivity in children & to determine any relation between <b>anti-HAV</b> positivity & socioeconomic condition. Materials & Methods: A cross sectional observational study was conducted at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) Hospital & Dhaka Shishu (Children) Hospital (DSH) from July 2008 to June 2009. Serum samples from 254 children aged between 1 - 15 years were tested for antibody (IgM & IgG) against hepatitis A virus (HAV) and detailed history was taken to find out the associated risk factors like residence, family income, source of drinking water, sanitation facility etc. Results: Hepatitis A virus antibody was positive in 141 (55. 5 %) of 254 children. Among all children <b>anti-HAV</b> positivity was significantly higher (p= 0. 004) in lower income group (64. 8 %) than higher income group (47. 0 %). <b>Anti-HAV</b> positivity was significantly higher (93. 8 %) in non-sanitary latrine users & in those who used unsafe drinking water.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of antibodies to hepatitis A virus (<b>anti-HAV)</b> in future travellers, all visitors to the Zurich University Vaccination Center in July/August 1990 {{were invited to participate}} in a cross-sectional study. A total of 1126 future travellers were recruited to have a blood sample drawn and to complete a brief questionnaire. Among these, 35 refused or were excluded, thus 1091 were evaluated. The overall prevalence of <b>anti-HAV</b> was 16. 5 %. This rate was 5. 9 % in future travellers born in or after 1961, 11. 8 % in those born 1951 - 60, 21. 4 % in those born 1941 - 50 and exceeded 49 % in all decades born in or before 1940. Risk factors for significantly elevated <b>anti-HAV</b> rates were place of birth or a stay exceeding one year in tropical, subtropical or Southern European countries and travel for occupational reasons. Compared with findings from earlier surveys conducted mainly among blood donors in Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe, {{the results of the present}} study show lower <b>anti-HAV</b> prevalence rates. In conclusion, it seems unnecessary to test future travellers for <b>anti-HAV</b> except if they are born before 1944, or have a history of jaundice or of prolonged stay in the tropics, subtropics or in Southern Europe...|$|E
