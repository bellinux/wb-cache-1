40|$|Although {{induction}} of apoptosis by avian reovirus {{has been}} demonstrated in primary chicken embryonic fibroblast and several cell lines, to date, the potential significance of avian reovirus (ARV) -induced apoptosis and its pathways in cultured cells are still largely unknown. We now provide the first evidence of upregulation of p 53 and Bax and specifically for Bax translocation from cytosol to mitochondria following infection with a cytoplasmically replicating RNA virus. Bax translocation to the mitochondria led {{to the release of}} mitochondrial proapoptic factors cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria to the cytosol, but not the release of <b>apoptosis-inducting</b> <b>factor.</b> Activation of caspases- 9 and - 3 which cleaves the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in ARV-infected BHK- 21 cells was also detected. Internucleosomal DNA cleavage was prevented by caspase inhibitors, further demonstrating that ARV-induced apoptosis was executed through caspase-dependent mechanisms. Stable expression of human bel- 2 in BHK- 21 cells not only blocked ARV-induced apoptosis and DNA fragmentation but also reduced the level of infectious virus production and its spread in BHK- 21 cells infected with ARV at a low multiplicity of infection. All our data suggest that p 53 and the mitochondria-mediated pathway played an important regulatory role in ARV-induced apoptosis in BHK- 21 cells. To further study the pathogenesis of ARV infection, a dual-labeling assay was used for the simultaneous detection of cells containing viral antigen and apoptotic cells. Dual-labeling assay revealed that the majority of antigen-expressing cells were not apoptotic. Remarkably, some apoptotic but non-antigen-expressing cells were frequently located in the vicinity of antigen-expressing cells. Syncytium formation in ARV-infected BHK- 21 cells undergoing apoptosis, was apparent in large syncytia at late infection times, indicating a correlation between virus replication and apoptosis in cultured cells.
