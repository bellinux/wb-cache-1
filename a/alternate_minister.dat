5|$|A student {{member of}} the Communist Party of Greece, Tsakalotos joined Synaspismos in the early 1990s and {{was elected to the}} Central Committee of Syriza in 2004 shortly after their formation. He was first elected as a Member of the Hellenic Parliament for Athens B in the May 2012 {{legislative}} election and has been re-elected in every election since. In opposition from 2012 to 2015, he was Syriza's shadow finance minister. When Syriza entered government in January 2015, Tsakalotos was appointed as an <b>Alternate</b> <b>Minister</b> within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In April, he took over as head of Greece's negotiating team on the third bailout package. On 6 July 2015, following Yanis Varoufakis's resignation, Tsakalotos was appointed as Minister of Finance. He was re-appointed in September 2015 following the snap legislative election.|$|E
500|$|In the {{legislative}} election on 25 January 2015, Syriza won a near-majority of seats, with 149 out of 300, and so formed a coalition with the right-wing anti-austerity party Independent Greeks. Tsipras became {{prime minister and}} formed his cabinet on 27 January, appointing Tsakalotos as <b>Alternate</b> <b>Minister</b> for International Economic Relations, subordinate to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Nikos Kotzias. Tsakalotos described his role as follows: [...] " [...] means coordinating our approach to promoting exports and attracting investment. It also means upgrading our economic diplomacy which needs to go beyond traditional sectors, for instance exporting olive oil and importing capital goods." ...|$|E
500|$|The bailout {{referendum}} on 5 July {{resulted in a}} 'No' vote {{to the adoption of}} the bailout package. The following day, Varoufakis resigned as finance minister. As he left the finance ministry, he suggested that Tsakalotos was likely to succeed him, and Tsakalotos was subsequently sworn-in later that day. In the process of this, Tsakalotos relinquished his previous ministerial position of <b>Alternate</b> <b>Minister</b> for International Economic Relations. Tsakalotos was noted for his differences with Varoufakis, for example, the Financial Times noted that he [...] "could hardly be more different from his flamboyant predecessor". At a press conference shortly following his appointment, Tsakalotos said: [...] "I cannot hide from you that I am quite nervous. I am not taking on this job at the easiest point in Greek history." ...|$|E

500|$|Following the {{re-election}} of the Syriza-ANEL coalition, Tsakalotos was tipped {{to resume}} the role of Minister of Finance, however the state media reported that {{he was reluctant to}} do so. Nonetheless, he was reappointed as Minister of Finance on 23 September, as part of the Tsipras' second cabinet. Chouliarakis, the interim Minister of Finance, was retained in the finance ministry as an <b>Alternate</b> <b>Minister</b> of Finance. Later in September, {{in an interview with the}} Financial Times, Tsakalotos said that it was [...] "absolutely critical that we get something on debt relief." [...] He added: [...] "By the second quarter of 2016, if we get a positive review, bank recapitalisation and debt relief, I don’t see any reason why there shouldn’t be a return to growth." [...] He also said that the new government would make serious attempts to crack down on tax evasion: [...] "It will be a central aspect of our policies, which will determine the success of the government, because it’s the only way the Greek people will accept difficult measures that show we’re all in the same boat." ...|$|E
