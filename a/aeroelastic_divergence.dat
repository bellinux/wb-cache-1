40|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{known as}} <b>aeroelastic</b> <b>divergence</b> {{is the focus of}} this work. The analyses and experiment presented here show that divergence can occur without a structural dynamic mode losing its oscillatory nature. <b>Aeroelastic</b> <b>divergence</b> occurs when the structural restorative capability or stiffness of a structure is overwhelmed by the static aerodynamic moment. This static aeroelastic coupling does not require the structural dynamic system behavior to cease, however. Aeroelastic changes in the dynamic mode behavior are governed not only by the stiffness, but by damping and inertial properties. The work presented here supports these fundamental assertions by examining a simple system: a typical section airfoil with only a rotational structural degree of freedom.

It exploits bend-twist coupling to mitigate <b>aeroelastic</b> <b>divergence.</b> The method {{is intended for}} estimating possible weight savings in preliminary aircraft design stages. A structural beam model of the composite wingbox is derived from anisotropic shell theory and the governing aeroelastic equations are presented for a spanwise discretized forward swept wing. Optimization of the system to reduce wing mass is undertaken for sweep angles of - 35 degrees to 0 degrees and Mach numbers from 0. 7 to 0. 9. A subset of lamination parameters (LPs) {{and the number of}} laminate plies in each pre-defined direction (restricted to 0, +/- 45 and 90 degrees}) serve as design variables. A bi-level hybrid optimization approach is employed, making use of a genetic algorithm (GA) and a subsequent gradient-based optimizer.

40|$|Nonlinearities in {{aircraft}} {{mechanisms are}} inevitable, {{especially in the}} control system. It is necessary to investigate the effects {{of them on the}} dynamic response and control performance of aeroelastic system. In this paper, based on the state-dependent Riccati equation method, a state feedback suboptimal control law is derived for aeroelastic response and flutter suppression of a three degree-of-freedom typical airfoil section. With the control law designed, nonlinear effects of freeplay in the control surface and time delay between the control input and actuator are investigated by numerical approach. A cubic nonlinearity in pitch degree is adopted to prevent the <b>aeroelastic</b> responses from <b>divergence</b> when the flow velocity exceeds the critical flutter speed. For the system with a freeplay, the responses of both open- and closed-loop systems are determined with Runge-Kutta algorithm in conjunction with Henon's method.

The simulation results show that the freeplay leads to a forward phase response and a slight increase of flutter speed of the closed-loop system. The effect of freeplay on the aeroelastic response decreases as the flow velocity increases.

40|$|The {{scope of}} the work is to develop a {{methodology}} for more reliable and efficient reduced-order models (ROM) for a linearized analysis of the aeroelastic stability and gust response of Launch Vehicles (LV). The approach has allowed to analyze the aeroelastic performance of an LV in the neighborhoods of actual flight conditions in supersonic regime and it has also allowed to predict the aeroelastic behavior of a developed future version of the LV under study. Aeroelastic analysis of LVs {{is an essential part of}} their design procedure. Nonetheless, as a result of the lack of validated commercial codes and experimental tests on full-scaled or scaled model, in most cases, the analysis is limited to static <b>aeroelastic</b> instability analysis (<b>divergence).</b> Indeed, the dynamic aeroelasticity for LVs is not as developed as that of the fixed wings. The direct employment of numerical CFD simulations for a fully coupled fluid-structure model is typically very expensive from a computational point of view and practically not useful in a LV design phase. Thus, there is space, in the authorsâ€™ opinion, to address this kind of aeroelastic dynamic stability analysis by a modal-based approach. In the first part of the paper, a linearized dynamic aeroelastic analysis of a LV is addressed: the approach is based on integrated dynamic aeroelastic/CFD modeling methodology. Specifically, it consists of using a global modal description for the structural dynamics of the launcher in terms of the natural frequencies and modes of vibration, coupled with an unsteady Euler-based aerodynamics in the neighborhoods of a flight condition. The generalized-aerodynamic-force (GAF) matrix is identified, via linearization process, in an high-subsonic flow phase and in presence of an angle of attack performing several prescribed modal-transient boundary conditions on a Euler-based CFD code. Thereby, a generalized (iterative) eigenanalysis is performed to study the aeroelastic stability on the linearized model of the LV in the prescribed flow condition. In the second part of the paper, a vertical gust input has been considered for the LV by including the effects on the unsteady pressure field of a rigid transversal modal transient boundary condition on the same Euler-based CFD code: the identified modal gust vector allows to determine the complete frequency gust response matrix for the LV at the prescribed flight conditions. The approach has been applied to the stability and gust response analysis of LYRA LV, enhanced-designed version of VEGA LV, the single-body multi-stages launcher recently developed by the European Space Agency (ESA). Indeed, the methodology has been considered as an actual tool for the aeroelastic analysis and design of LVs...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{aircraft}} tend to {{be light}} and slender. The high aspect ratio reduces the induced drag, increase fuel efficiency, and provide enough lift a low speeds. Therefore such wing types are used for long endurance unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). A drawback of these wings {{is that they are}} more vulnerable for <b>aeroelastic</b> phenomena like <b>divergence,</b> aileron reversal, and flutter. To increase the dynamic pressure, at which one of these phenomena occurs, the stiffness of the wing needs to be increased leading to an increase of the wing weight. Instead of increasing the wing weight, the flexibility of the wing can be used to change the shape of the wing to optimize flight performance or to control the rolling motion of the aircraft. This research area of Active Aeroelastic Wings has grown in the recent years. With this concept, very little control surface motion is used to employ the energy of the airstream to achieve the desirable wing twist. In this thesis work, an Active Aeroelastic Wing is designed, built and tested in a low-speed wind tunnel. After testing, the possibility to predict the performance accurately with a state-of-the-art modeling tool is verified. First, a qualitative background overview is given about the three most important aeroelastic phenomena. These phenomena are torsional divergence, control reversal, and classical flutter and are described to understand the effects of the different wing parameters on the deformations. Secondly, an overview is given of the techniques that have been used to change the shape of the wing. From these concepts, the sweepable spar method has been chosen. This method uses the ability to change the position of the elastic axis, so that the twist deformations can be increased or decreased. Based on this method, a test article has been built that has similar planform shape as the Global Hawk. Instead of ailerons for roll control, the test article is equipped with an aeroelastic outer wing segment that can change its elastic axis. With this aeroelastic outer wing part, the wing is able to provide a rolling moment. Afterwards, its performance has been tested in the Open Jet Facility of the TU Delft. The results of the bench tests showed that the moveable spar is able to change the position of the elastic center at the wing tip. With the main spar at different positions, a change in the torsional stiffness of the wing has been observed. During the wind tunnel test the influence of the sweep angle on the rolling moment has been analyzed. The results did not clearly indicate a beneficial effect of the sweep angle on the rolling moment coefficient. Therefore the wing configuration is set to sweep angle of zero degrees to continue the testing. For this configuration, the main spar moved aft on the left and forward on the right wing, the maximum achievable roll helix angle {{is similar to that of}} a Boeing 747 - 200 during cruise. However, the roll performance of the Global Hawk is about five times larger than the test article. Note that aeroelastic effects have been neglected for the Global Hawk, which reduces the aileron control effectiveness. Finally, the results of the wind tunnel experiments are compared with the simulation results of Proteus. Proteus is an analysis and design framework that uses a non-linear beam model combined with lifting line theory to determine the aeroelastic effects. To analyze the test article some structural and aerodynamic modifications have been made in Proteus, to integrate the effects of a sweepable elastic axis and cambered airfoils. With these modifications the predicted rolling moment coefficient was about 40 % smaller compared to the wind tunnel results. Therefore it is concluded that Proteus is currently not able to predict the results accurately. Flight Performance and PropulsionAerospace Engineerin...|$|R

The laminates are themselves composed of lamina {{arranged in a}} symmetrical and unbalanced fashion. The fibers are oriented so that no fiber has a counterpart in the same ply which is at an exact anti-angle to itself. The laminate orientation creates a wash-out in a forward swept wing and alleviates aeroelastic loading. Further discussion is devoted to center-of-pressure movement, flutter behavior, aeroelasticity and <b>aeroelastic</b> <b>divergence,</b> and wind tunnel testing of aerodynamically tailored wings.

It is found that the <b>aeroelastic</b> <b>divergence</b> affecting swept-forward wings does not occur with an oblique wing, whose aeroelastic instability sets in at a dynamic pressure exceeding that for static divergence of swept-forward wings, and appears {{in the form of}} undamped oscillations.

40|$|In {{aeroelastic}} {{research the}} interaction between the structural wing and the aerodynamics is investigated. Currently the wingbox structures, as other components, are manufactured out of composite materials to replace the metallic airplanes. Composites have the ability to be designed by defining the orientation and thickness of a laminate. This property {{can be used in a}} process to minimize the wingbox weight under aeroelastic loads which is called aeroelastic tailoring or optimisation. The main advantage of a lighter wing(box) design is the lower fuel consumption of the aircraft during its lifetime. Werter and Breuker (2015) have developed the Proteus tool to perform aeroelastic tailoring on a wingbox structure. An interface is created to export the wingbox model to Nastran using ModGen (Software developed by DLR). The Nastran model is further enhanced by using the internal gradient based optimizer to tailor the wingbox structure. Goal of this thesis is twofold. First the 1 D Proteus model is verified using the extension to Nastran. Secondly the influence of engine position and sweep on the optimized wingbox weight of the One Engine Reference Model (OERM) is investigated. The designed Nastran interface performs the optimisation. In the Nastran model the skin and spars are optimized for. Ribs should be present such that the cross-section does not deform too much. The ribs themselves are not optimized. No topology optimisation is performed, the dimension and locations of spars and ribs are inputs to the model. A linear analysis is performed in Nastran. Four different analysis types are defined: <b>aeroelastic</b> deflection, flutter, <b>divergence</b> and static point deflection. The tailoring will be performed under different optimisation constraints for each type of analysis. For the first type the strains should be below the allowable and the tip rotation may not exceed 12 deg. The second and third condition refer to flutter and divergence which may not occur for the given flight condition. The last case limits for example the engine displacement during landing. The strains are also limited for this load case. To verify the correct implementation of the model a verification procedure has been performed. For a simple rectangular beam the deformation is compared to elementary mechanics. In the next verification step a wingbox structure is considered and the results are compared to Proteus (Werter and Breuker, 2015). For similar flight conditions under a given Mach number similar results are obtained. The divergence pressure between the two models is comparable. To investigate the influence of engine location and sweep the One Engine Reference Model (OERM) is taken as a reference. The Proteus model predicts analogous aeroelastic behaviour compared to the Nastran model. The Proteus model therefore is verified. For the optimisation six load cases are defined. These are derived from the flight envelope as set by airworthiness authorities. The load cases consist out of four aeroelastic flight conditions: cruise, symmetric push down and two different symmetric pull up conditions. Next a stability load case is added as no divergence and flutter may occur. The various engine locations on the OERM are optimized with and without landing load case to see the influence of landing on the engine location. The lightest wingbox design was found for an engine located around 70 % of the span. This design violates the landing load case. Considering the landing load case the lightest wingbox design is found at 50 % of the span. Compared to the baseline model a wingbox weight reduction of 18 % is achieved. If the engine is placed further towards the tip a lot of additional material is required for the engine to not hit the runway. An engine location further down the span is preferred as the engine has a relief effect on the wing lowering the (upward) deflection and thereby lowering the critical strains. The thickness and stiffness distribution creates a tip down deformation of the wing. Next the quarter chord sweep of the OERM is varied. For a swept forward wing the wingbox weight is higher compared to the swept backward wingbox design. Additional stiffness is required to prevent wing divergence. The optimum wingbox weight is found for a sweptback wing of 50 deg. Comparing the design to the baseline model a weight reduction of only 4. 3 % is achieved. However sweeping the wing comes at the cost of a higher angle of attack during cruise as the produced lift reduces for higher sweep angles. As with the optimized engine location wingbox the stiffness and thickness distribution is as such that a tip down deformation of the wing results during the aeroelastic load cases. Performing an aeroelastic gradient based optimisation using Nastran is possible. Great caution is advised with the Nastran optimizer as the end result is dependent on the type of optimisation performed. The model can be further extended to take ribs and buckling into account. An external optimizer could be considered to have larger control over the optimisation process.

This paper reports on the results of dynamic stability analyses in the lateral and longitudinal directions including the vehicle rigid-body and flexible modes. A static aeroelastic analysis using the normal vibration mode equations of motion was performed to determine the cause of a loss of longitudinal static margin with increasing airspeed. This loss of static margin was found to be due to aeroelastic 'washin' of the forward-swept blades and 'washout' of the aft-swept blades moving the aircraft aerodynamic center forward of the center of gravity.

The aircraft weight is estimated according to four component groups with different sizing drivers. Emphasis {{is placed on}} the wing weight estimation considering aeroelastic effects. A physics-based wing weight estimation tool is used in a Design of Experiments and the results are applied in a least-squares regression obtaining wing Weight Estimating Relationships (WERs). Typical parameters covering a wide design space are considered so the method is applicable to business jets, regional turboprops, short-range and long-range transport aircraft. The WERs equations are presented in typical handbook form for simple application. Static aeroelastic loads, aileron efficiency and <b>aeroelastic</b> <b>divergence</b> effects on the wing weight are considered. Equations are presented for conventional transport aircraft, forward swept wing, strut-braced wing, and forward-swept strut-braced wing concepts. The WERs are applicable to aluminum or carbon-fiber reinforced plastic wings. The equations are verified for accuracy with available designs and the sensitivities are checked against the weights tool used to generate them. Application of the method in a simple design study illustrates its usefulness in quickly assessing different concepts for a set of requirements...|$|E
40|$|A linearized {{aeroelastic}} {{analysis for}} a launch {{vehicle in the}} neighborhood of its transonic flight phase together with a local sensitivity study are presented. This investigation includes only dynamic aeroelastic instabilities, namely, flutter instabilities. Indeed, the launch vehicle considered for the applications is assumed to be initially free from other static instabilities like <b>aeroelastic</b> <b>divergence,</b> buckling, or from follower propulsive-force destabilizing effects, the study of which has not been included in the present paper. A modal description for the structural dynamics of the launcher in terms of the first nonzero natural frequencies and modes of vibration is carried out. Moreover, a reduced-order model for the unsteady transonic aerodynamics is obtained, performing several prescribed modal transient boundary conditions by laminar-based computational fluid dynamics. Thus, a modal input/output system identification for the aerodynamics, performed in the frequency domain, allows one to identify the linearized unsteady aerodynamic operator {{in the neighborhood of}} the specific transonic flight condition. Both the structural and aerodynamic models are finally employed in the aeroelastic coupled model given by the generalized Lagrangian equations of motion. An eigenanalysis, in terms of aeroelastic-system poles and complex eigenvectors on the linearized model, is performed to check the local dynamic stability of the launch vehicle. Finally, the proposed approach also allows one to give an evaluation of the uncertainty in the obtained stability scenario in terms of perturbing flight parameters like angle of attack, Much number, flight speed, and air density...|$|E
40|$|Aeroelastic {{design of}} joined-wing {{configurations}} is yet a relatively unexplored topic which poses several difficulties. Due to the over constrained {{nature of the}} system combined with structural geometric nonlinearities, the behavior of Joined Wings is often counterintuitive and presents challenges not seen in standard layouts. In particular, instability observed on detailed aircraft models but never thoroughly investigated, is here studied {{with the aid of}} a theoretical/computational framework. Snap-type of instabilities are shown for both pure structural and aeroelastic cases. The concept of snap- divergence is introduced to clearly identify the true aeroelastic instability, as opposed to the usual <b>aeroelastic</b> <b>divergence</b> evaluated through eigenvalue approach. Multi-stable regions and isola-type of bifurcations are possible characterizations of the nonlinear response of Joined Wings, and may lead to branch -jumping phenomena well below nominal critical load condition. Within this picture, sensitivity to (unavoidable) manufacturing defects could have potential catastrophic effects. The phenomena studied in this work suggest that the design process for Joined Wings needs to be revisited and should focus, when instability is concerned, on nonlinear post-critical analysis since linear methods may provide wrong trend indications and also hide potentially catastrophical situations. Dynamic aeroelastic analyses are also performed. Flutter occurrence is critically analyzed with frequency and time- domain capabilities. Sensitivity to different-fidelity aeroelastic modeling (fluid-structure interface algorithm, aerodynamic solvers) is assessed showing that, for some configurations, wake modeling (rigid versus free) has a strong impact on the results. Post-flutter regimes are also explored. Limit cycle oscillations are observed, followed, in some cases, by flip bifurcations (period doubling) and loss of periodicity of the solution. Aeroelastic analyses are then carried out on a realistic PrantlPlane to understand effects induced by freeplay of mobile surfaces. Conclusive work is also performed to study the interaction between rigid body and elastic modes, assessing the occurrence of body-freedom flutte...|$|E
