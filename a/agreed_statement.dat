2500|$|In a 1957 {{discussion}} with Whitcomb, Walter E. Lammerts suggested an [...] "informal association" [...] to exchange ideas, and possibly research, on flood geology. Morris was unavailable {{to get things}} started, then around 1961 Wiliam J. Tinkle got in touch, and they set about recruiting others. They had difficulty in finding supporters with scientific qualifications. The Creation Research Committee of ten they put together on 9 February 1962 had varying views on {{the age of the}} Earth, but all opposed evolution. They then succeeded in recruiting others into what became the Creation Research Society (CRS) in June 1963, and grew rapidly. Getting an <b>agreed</b> <b>statement</b> of belief was problematic, they affirmed that the Bible was [...] "historically and scientifically true in the original autographs" [...] so that [...] "the account of origins in Genesis is a factual presentation of simple historical truths" [...] and [...] "The great flood described in Genesis, commonly referred to as the Noachian Flood, was an historic event worldwide in its extent and effect", but to Morris's disappointment they did not make flood geology mandatory. They lacked a qualified geologist, and Morris persuaded the group to appoint Clifford L. Burdick as their only Earth scientist, overcoming initial concerns raised by Lammerts. The CRS grew rapidly, with an increasing proportion of the membership adhering to strict young Earth flood geology.|$|E

50|$|START II did {{not enter}} into force. On 14 April 2000 the Duma did finally ratify the treaty, in a largely {{symbolic}} move since the ratification was made contingent on preserving the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM Treaty) and thereby preserving the long-standing principle of mutually assured destruction (MAD). To be specific, Russian ratification was made contingent on the U.S. Senate ratifying a September 1997 addendum to START II which included <b>agreed</b> <b>statements</b> on demarcation of strategic versus tactical missile defences. Neither of these occurred because of U.S. Senate opposition, where a faction objected to any action supportive of the existing ABM Treaty.|$|R

His judgment of Vizard attracted widespread media attention, but was widely misunderstood as the matter was a civil hearing, involving the review by the Court of an <b>Agreed</b> <b>Statement</b> of Facts [...] The head of ASIC, Jeff Lucy, later conceded that much of the media outrage was caused by ASIC's failure to properly communicate the full facts to the media.|$|E
