25|$|The Workmen's Compensation Ordinance (WCO) was an {{insurance}} that covered injuries and other <b>accidents</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> {{and it was}} introduced on 29 April 1929. From that year to 1941, stamps denominated 1d were issued with the colour being changed annually {{in order to prevent}} fraud (although some colours were reissued in different years). The issue for 1938–39 was locally overprinted with the years of validity. The law was revised in 1943, resulting in a change in procedure and the need for 2d stamps. Between 1943 and 1946, old stocks of postage stamps and earlier WCO stamps were issued with provisional surcharges. These were followed by a new issue between 1944 and 1956 in the same design as the previous stamps, but denominated 2d and once again in various colours.|$|E
2500|$|Problems at {{work are}} more {{strongly}} associated with health complaints than are any other life stressor-more so than even financial problems or family problems. Occupational stress {{accounts for more than}} 10% of work-related health claims. [...] Many studies suggest that psychologically demanding jobs that allow employees little control over the work process increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. [...] Research indicates that job stress increases the risk for development of back and upper-extremity musculoskeletal disorders. Other disorders that can be caused or exacerbated by occupational stress include sleep disorders, headache, mood disorders, upset stomach, hypertension, high cholesterol, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease, depression, and anxiety. Stress at work can also increase the risk of acquiring an infection and the risk of <b>accidents</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

50|$|The European Statistics on <b>Accidents</b> <b>at</b> <b>Work</b> (ESAW) {{have been}} used to collect {{statistical}} data on <b>accidents</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> These statistics are available from 1994 onwards. They allow a uniform presentation for European and member-state statistics and a comparison between member-state statistics. A harmonized methodology for data collection has been created. Information is collected on the following variables: economic activity of the employer, occupation, age and sex of the victim, type of injury, body part injured, time of the accident, size of the business, employment status of the victim and work days lost. Phase three of the ESAW methodology has been gradually implemented from the reference year 2001 onwards. In addition to the variables above, it includes information concerning the circumstances and events leading to the accidents.|$|E

50|$|Young {{workers are}} {{at higher risk}} for {{occupational}} injury and face certain occupational hazards at a higher rate; this is generally due to their employment in high-risk industries.

These workers are also at higher risk for motor vehicle <b>accidents</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> due to less work experience, a lower use of seatbelts, and higher rates of distracted driving. To mitigate this risk, those under the age of 17 are restricted from certain types of driving, including transporting people and goods under certain circumstances.|$|E
