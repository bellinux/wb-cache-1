2500|$|Since Humans vs. Zombies {{can last}} for days, rules {{establish}} [...] "safe zones" [...] where gameplay does not take place, and where players can stop participation in the game for a certain period. Safe zones are designated by the administrators in conjunction with University rules and/or other <b>applicable</b> <b>rules.</b> Safe zones include dorm rooms, bathrooms, dining halls, Academic buildings, Health centers and other such places. Safe zones vary by the rules set at each separate University. [...] Some include every building on the campus and all vehicles, others may exclude some, but not all buildings and vehicles. [...] Players are also considered safe attending a mandatory academic or athletic event. They are not safe, however, going to or coming from these events. Some colleges also consider a [...] "wheel rule" [...] where players are in a safe zone if {{they are on a}} skateboard, bicycle, or wearing rollerblades. Generally, HvZ is played on-campus, so off-campus is considered a safe zone as well. Under the original rules, however, all Humans must sleep on-campus and being away for longer than 24 hours warrants automatic death or removal. Every area not designated a safe zone by administrators is considered a free-play area where players may tag or be tagged. Under the original rules, the game is played at all times and never stops until the game has reached the conclusion.|$|E
2500|$|Second, because §206(a)(1)(C) {{says the}} minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, courts have grappled with which hours count as [...] "working". Early cases {{established}} that time traveling to work did not count as work, unless it was controlled by, required by, and {{for the benefit of}} an employer, like traveling through a coal mine. For example, in, Anderson v Mount Clemens Pottery Co a majority of five to two justices held that employees had to be paid for the long walk to work through an employer's Mount Clemens Pottery Co facility. According to Murphy J this time, and time setting up workstations, involved [...] "exertion of a physical nature, controlled or required by the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the employer's benefit." [...] In Armour & Co v Wantock firefighters claimed they should be fully paid while on call at their station for fires. The Supreme Court held that, even though the firefighters could sleep or play cards, because [...] "eadiness to serve may be hired quite as much as service itself" [...] and time waiting on call was [...] "a benefit to the employer". By contrast, in 1992 the Sixth Circuit controversially held that needing to be infrequently available by phone or pager, where movement was not restricted, was not working time. Time spent doing unusual cleaning, for instance showering off toxic substances, does count as working time, and so does time putting on special protective gear. Under §207(e) pay for overtime should be one and a half times the regular pay. In Walling v Helmerich and Payne Inc, the Supreme Court held that an employer's scheme of paying lower wages in the morning, and higher wages in the afternoon, to argue that overtime only needed to be calculated on top of (lower) morning wages was unlawful. Overtime has to be calculated based on the average regular pay. However, in Christensen v Harris County six Supreme Court judges held that police in Harris County, Texas could be forced to use up their accumulated [...] "compensatory time" [...] (allowing time off with full pay) before claiming overtime. Writing for the dissent, Stevens J said the majority had misconstrued §207(o)(2), which requires an [...] "agreement" [...] between employers, unions or employees on the <b>applicable</b> <b>rules,</b> and the Texas police had not agreed. Third, §203(m) allows employers to deduct sums from wages for food or housing that is [...] "customarily furnished" [...] for employees. The Secretary of Labor may determine what counts as fair value. Most problematically, outside states that have banned the practice, they may deduct money from a [...] "tipped employee" [...] for money over the [...] "cash wage required to be paid such an employee on August 20, 1996" [...] – and this was $2.13 per hour. If an employee does not earn enough in tips, the employer must still pay the $7.25 minimum wage. But this means in many states tips do not go to workers: tips are taken by employers to subsidize low pay. Under FLSA 1938 §216(b)-(c) the Secretary of State can enforce the law, or individuals can claim on their own behalf. Federal enforcement is rare, so most employees are successful if they are in a labor union. The Consumer Credit Protection Act of 1968 limits deductions or [...] "garnishments" [...] by employers to 25 per cent of wages, though many states are considerably more protective. Finally, under the Portal to Portal Act of 1947, where Congress limited {{the minimum wage}} laws in a range of ways, §254 puts a two-year time limit on enforcing claims, or three years if an employing entity is guilty of a willful violation.|$|E
