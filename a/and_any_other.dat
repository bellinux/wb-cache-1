At that time, all packages in the testing branch become the new stable branch. Although freeze dates are time-based, release dates are not, which are announced by the release managers {{a couple of weeks}} beforehand.|$|E

5|$|The {{incident}} on Hill 303 led UN commander, General Douglas MacArthur, to broadcast to the North Korean Army on August 20, denouncing the atrocities.

5|$|There {{are several}} bush {{remedies}} {{used to treat}} jack jumper stings (<b>and</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> Myrmecia sting). The young tips of a bracken fern provide a useful bush remedy to treat jack jumper stings, discovered and currently used by indigenous Australians. The tips are rubbed on the stung area, and may relieve the local pain after getting stung. Another plant used as a bush remedy is Carpobrotus glaucescens (known as angular sea-fig or pigface).|$|E

5|$|Accepting {{the offer}} on January 19, 2009, Ryan {{immediately}} began {{to carry out a}} plan of action that he had outlined for the franchise's future. He planned to remove the players from distractions {{on and off the field}} and allow them get to know one another to build team chemistry. Thus, training camp was moved to the campus of SUNY Cortland, where the team would be relatively secluded from the media <b>and</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> distractions. Ryan and general manager Mike Tannenbaum were also determined to draft a quarterback who could lead and be the face of the franchise. As a result, the team traded up to select Mark Sanchez of USC in the first round with the fifth overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{territorial}} boundary {{line between the}} U.S. and British North America (specifically, the province of Quebec until 1791 and Upper Canada thereafter) ran {{through the middle of}} Lake Erie and then up the Detroit River, combined with the prevailing belief regarding the location of the southern tip of Lake Michigan, the framers of the 1802 Ohio Constitution believed it was the intent of Congress that Ohio's northern boundary should certainly be north of the mouth of the Maumee River, and possibly even of the Detroit River. Ohio would thus be granted access to most or all of the Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania, <b>and</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> new states carved out of the Northwest Territory would have access to the Great Lakes via Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{is found}} as linear {{chromosomes}} in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. A chromosome is an organized structure consisting of DNA and histones. The set of chromosomes {{in a cell}} <b>and</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> hereditary information found in the mitochondria, chloroplasts, or other locations is collectively known as a cell's genome. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is localized in the cell nucleus, or with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its genotype.|$|E

5|$|Like {{traditional}} role-playing games, Kingdom Hearts {{features an}} experience point system that determines character development. As enemies are defeated, the player characters gain experience and grow stronger, {{gaining access to}} new abilities. Unlike other games of its type, Kingdom Hearts allows a degree of character development customization through a short tutorial found {{at the beginning of}} the game. The tutorial allows the player to select from one of three main attributes―strength, defense, or magic―for Sora to excel in and one to lack in. By choosing certain options, the player may manipulate how Sora learns abilities, grows statistically, and gains levels. Donald, Goofy, <b>and</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> additional party members are assigned specific areas of strength from the outset. Donald excels in magic, while Goofy excels in defense and special attacks.|$|E
5|$|Local wine-labeling {{regulations}} are slowly {{catching up with}} the DNA evidence, a process that has been slowed by trade disputes. The European Union recognized Zinfandel as a synonym for Primitivo in January 1999, meaning that Italian Primitivos can be labelled as Zinfandel in the United States <b>and</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> country that recognises EU labelling laws. Italian winemakers {{have taken advantage of}} these rules and shipped Primitivo wines to the United States labelled as Zinfandels, with the approval of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).|$|E
5|$|Pteranodon was {{notable for}} its skull crest, though the {{function}} of this crest has been a subject of debate. Most explanations {{have focused on the}} blade-like, backward pointed crest of male P. longiceps, however, and ignored the wide range of variation across age and sex. The fact that the crests vary so much rules out most practical functions other than for use in mating displays. Therefore, display was probably the main function of the crest, <b>and</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> functions were secondary.|$|E

5|$|The Alcathoe bat (Myotis alcathoe) is a European bat in {{the genus}} Myotis. Known only from Greece and Hungary {{when it was}} first {{described}} in 2001, its known distribution has since expanded to Spain, England, Sweden, and Azerbaijan, among other countries. It is similar to the whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus) and other species and is difficult to distinguish from them. However, its brown fur is distinctive and it is clearly different in characters of its karyotype and DNA sequences. Although some genetic data suggest that it is related to Geoffroy's bat (Myotis emarginatus), other analyses do not support a close relationship between M.alcathoe <b>and</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> species.|$|E
5|$|The Incredible Hulk premiered on June 8, 2008 at the Gibson Amphitheatre in Universal City, California and was {{released}} in theaters on June 13, 2008, receiving generally favorable reviews by critics upon release. Critical praise went to the improved visuals, action sequences, and the portrayal of the title character. The film was number one at the box office, grossing over $263 million worldwide. Norton was set to reprise the role of Banner in The Avengers <b>and</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> MCU installment featuring the character, but he was ultimately replaced by Mark Ruffalo, who has signed on to portray the character in all potential sequels.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty was {{weighted}} in Alexios' {{favor and}} {{provided for the}} eventual absorption of Antioch and its territory into the Empire. Alexios, recognizing the impossibility of driving Bohemond out of Antioch, tried to absorb him into the structure of Byzantine rule, and put him work for the Empire's benefit. Bohemond was to retain Antioch until his death with the title of doux, unless the emperor (either Alexios or, in the future, John) chose for any reason to renege on the deal. The principality would revert to direct Byzantine rule on Bohemond's death. Bohemond therefore could not set up a dynasty in Antioch, although he was guaranteed the right {{to pass on to}} his heirs the County of Edessa, <b>and</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> territories he managed to acquire in the Syrian interior.|$|E

5|$|Toxic {{blue-green algae}} blooms are a {{reasonably}} common occurrence in the lake. Warnings about coming {{into contact with}} the water are released when an algal bloom is detected. Attempts are being made to limit the amount of phosphates entering the lake in the hope of improving its water quality. Blue-green algae (more correctly cyanobacteria) produce toxins, which can be harmful for humans <b>and</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> animals that come in contact with the contaminated water. There have been several cases of dogs being affected after playing in and drinking the lake water.|$|E
5|$|After {{the poll}} closes, the {{presiding}} officer of each polling station seals the ballot boxes without opening them. Candidates or their polling agents may affix their own seals to the ballot boxes. The ballot boxes are then taken to counting centres {{to be opened}} and the ballots counted. A candidate or his or her counting agent may ask the returning officer for a recount of votes if {{the difference between the}} number of votes for the candidate with the most votes <b>and</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> candidate's number of votes is 2% or less, excluding rejected and tendered votes. After all counts, and recounts if any, have been completed, the returning officer ascertains whether the total number of electors registered to vote overseas is less than the difference between the number of votes for the two candidates with the highest number of votes. If so, the returning officer declares the candidate with the highest number of votes to be elected as President. If not, the overseas votes may be decisive. The returning officer then states the number of votes cast for each candidate and the date and location where the overseas votes will be counted.|$|E
5|$|As the Chief Executive of the State of Maryland, the Governor {{heads the}} {{executive}} branch of government, which includes all state executive departments and agencies, as well as advisory boards, commissions, committees, and task forces. The main constitutional responsibility of the Governor of Maryland, <b>and</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> State's chief executive, is to carry out the business of the state and to enforce the laws passed by the Legislature. The Governor also has some say in these laws, since the Governor has the ability to veto any bill sent to his or her desk by the Maryland General Assembly, though the Assembly may override that veto. The Governor is also given a number of more specific powers as relates to appropriations of state funds, the appointment of state officials, and also a variety of less prominent and less commonly utilized powers.|$|E
