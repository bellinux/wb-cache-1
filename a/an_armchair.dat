25|$|Salvador Dalí painted several {{pictures}} involving Hitler. The Enigma of Hitler (1939) {{depicts a}} torn photograph of Hitler {{on a plate}} in a typically surreal landscape over which hangs a broken telephone and an umbrella. He also painted the Metamorphosis of the Face of Hitler into a Moonlit Landscape (1958). One of his late works was Hitler Masturbating (1973), depicting just that, with Hitler seen from behind in <b>an</b> <b>armchair</b> {{in the center of}} a snow-filled desolate landscape.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} thus {{claims that}} if we find the inverted spectrum plausible, we must admit that qualia exist (and are non-physical). Some philosophers find it absurd that <b>an</b> <b>armchair</b> argument can prove something to exist, and the detailed argument does involve a lot of assumptions about conceivability and possibility, which are open to criticism. Perhaps {{it is not possible}} for a given brain state to produce anything other than a given quale in our universe, and that is all that matters.|$|E

Many versions have a drawer built under the pad, to hold writing implements. Other versions have such a drawer under the seat.|$|R

In 2007, organisers of the Saint Petersburg Economic Forum, which is a regional meeting of the World Economic Forum, wrote to the Presidential Administration requesting a photograph of the President for his accreditation badge, and the Putin Administration sent back to the organisers a photograph of Putin sitting in <b>an</b> <b>armchair</b> next to a fireplace with Konni lying at his feet.|$|E

She was buried at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. Her husband died just over a year later. She is the second longest-serving consort in British history (after the present Duke of Edinburgh), having served as such from her marriage (on 8 September 1761) to her death (17 November 1818), a total of 57 years and 70 days.|$|E
25|$|Designed by Air New Zealand in {{consultation}} with US design studio IDEO, the new Premium Economy cabin uses a 2-2-2 seating configuration. The central pair of Spaceseats are slightly angled for those travelling with a colleague or partner, and the two arm rests can form a single table for shared in-flight dining. The pairs of outboard Spaceseats on either side are angled to enhance privacy for solo flyers. The seats are built around a hard shell so the passenger in front cannot recline into {{the space of the}} person sitting behind. Instead, the seat slides forward and angles up as it reclines into the shell, similar to <b>an</b> <b>armchair.</b>|$|E

25|$|The main summit bears a cairn {{perched on}} the brink of the Mosedale Crags. To the west is a gentle slope, carpeted with short turf. The {{southern}} top also bears a large cairn and, a hundred yards beyond, is The Chair. This is <b>an</b> <b>armchair</b> shaped windshelter built onto a rock outcrop, a few yards off the path. It provides a fine vantage point for views southward, and is so prominent on the climb from Dore Head that it once gave its name to the fell. Scoat Fell and Pillar obstruct the view northward. The Scafells are well seen, as are the Wasdale Screes.|$|E
25|$|St Michael's most {{significant}} 17th-century {{feature is the}} monument to Francis Bacon, Viscount St Alban, who died in 1626. It is in a round-arched recess inserted for the purpose in the north wall of the chancel. The monument is a life-sized sculpture of Bacon seated in a relaxed pose in <b>an</b> <b>armchair.</b> The name of the sculptor is unknown, but {{it may have been}} Nicholas Stone. A copy of this statue, sculpted by Henry Weekes, was commissioned by William Whewell (Master of Trinity College, Cambridge between 1841 and 1866) and erected in the college chapel in 1845 to honour one of the college's most illustrious alumni.|$|E

Then he settles into <b>an</b> <b>armchair</b> and continues reading. He delights in stories of brave knights, fabulous giants and other fantastical creatures, {{but most of all}} Don Quixote dreams of his beloved Dulcinea, a woman that he believes to be so lovely and noble that she must be divinity. Gradually he nods and falls asleep to dream of their romantic adventures. Darkness falls.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, the Perls further donated 13 {{works by}} Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani, Georges Braque, Fernand Léger, Soutine and Pascin to the Metropolitan. That gift {{was one of}} the largest ever {{received}} by the Metropolitan’s department of 20th-century art and greatly helped round out the museum’s collection. Two were from 1910, Picasso’s Nude in <b>an</b> <b>Armchair</b> and Braque’s oval Candlestick and Playing Cards on a Table, and the third was Picasso’s Still Life With Pipes from 1912. The gift also included several Picassos from the 1930s, notably Sleeping Nude With Flowers and Girl Asleep at a Table. Klaus Perls was subsequently named honorary trustee of the Metropolitan Museum. The Perls Foundation was set up after the Perls Gallery closed in 1997.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 17 August 1786, Frederick died in <b>an</b> <b>armchair</b> in his study at Sanssouci, aged 74. He left {{instructions}} {{that he should be}} buried next to his greyhounds on the vineyard terrace {{on the side of the}} corps de logis of Sanssouci. His nephew and successor Frederick William II instead ordered the body to be entombed next to his father in the Potsdam Garrison Church. Near the end of World War II, Hitler ordered Frederick's coffin, along with those of his father Frederick William I, World War I Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, and Hindenburg's wife Gertrud, to be hidden in a salt mine as protection from destruction. The United States Army relocated the remains to Marburg in 1946; in 1953, the coffins of Frederick and his father were moved to Burg Hohenzollern.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the film}} industry, on May 16 the 1st Academy Awards were {{presented}} at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, with Wings winning Best Picture. Also, Hallelujah! became the first Hollywood film to contain an entirely black cast, and Atlantic, a film about the Titanic, is an early sound-on-film movie. The arts {{were in the midst}} of the Modernist movement, as Pablo Picasso painted two cubist works, Woman in a Garden and Nude in <b>an</b> <b>Armchair,</b> during this year. The surrealist painters Salvador Dalí and René Magritte completed several works, including The First Days of Spring and The Treachery of Images. On November 7 in New York City, the Museum of Modern Art opened to the public. The latest in modern architecture was also represented by the Barcelona Pavilion in Spain, and the Royal York Hotel in Toronto, at its completion the tallest building in the British Empire.|$|E

Lady Carmichael is thrilled to think that Poirot has visited to investigate some special crime but the detective tells her he is simply there to tame four wild horses. He visits General Grant whose house is filled with artifacts from India. The General himself completes the clichéd picture, sitting in <b>an</b> <b>armchair</b> with his foot bandaged up from gout, drinking port and railing against the world. Poirot breaks the news of the drugs and listens to the old man's cries of anger and sworn threats against whoever is getting his girls into trouble. Leaving the room, Poirot clumsily trips against his host.|$|E

Author Cash Peters, using less florid language, summarized it as [...] "the old woman with <b>an</b> <b>armchair</b> glued to her ass".|$|E
