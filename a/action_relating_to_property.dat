40|$|This paper looks empirically at the {{implications}} that protectionist measures implemented {{during the current}} crisis may have had for a country’s ability to attract foreign direct investment. The research utilizes data on such measures that is available from Global Trade Alert, combined with bilateral FDI data between OECD countries {{and a large number}} of partner countries for 2006 to 2009. This allows us to examine the short run effect that protectionist measures may have had on bilateral FDI flows. The verdict from this analysis is clear: a country that implements new protectionist measures may expect that this may result in lower foreign direct investment inflows into the economy. The point estimates from our preferred specifications suggest that, depending on the empirical model, the implementation of a trade protection measure is associated with about 40 to 80 percent lower FDI inflows. Trade protection {{does not appear to have}} any implications for the country’s FDI outflows, however. The negative effect on FDI inflows does not appear to be due to direct investment measures but rather <b>to</b> <b>actions</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intellectual <b>property</b> rights protection and other more trade related measuresFDI, protection, financial crisis...|$|R
40|$|Associated with {{a locally}} compact group G and a G-space X {{there is a}} Banach {{subspace}} LUC(X, G) of C_b(X), which has been introduced and studied by Lau and Chu in chulau. In this paper, we study some properties of the first dual space of LUC(X, G). In particular, we introduce a left action of LUC(G) ^* on LUC(X, G) ^* {{to make it a}} Banach left module and then we investigate the Banach subalgebra Z(X, G) of LUC(G) ^*, as the topological centre <b>related</b> <b>to</b> this module <b>action,</b> which contains M(G) as a closed subalgebra. Also, we show that the faithfulness of this module <b>action</b> is <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the <b>properties</b> of the action of G on X and we extend the main results of Lau lau from locally compact groups to G-spaces. Sufficient and/or necessary conditions for the equality Z(X, G) =M(G) or LUC(G) ^* are given. Finally, we apply our results to some special cases of G and X for obtaining various examples whose topological centres Z(X, G) are M(G), LUC(G) ^* or neither of them...|$|R
40|$|Analgesic and {{ulcerogenic}} properties {{have been}} studied for the copper(II) coordination complex of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug Fenoprofen and imidazole [Cu(fen) 2 (im) 2] (Cu: copper(II) ion; fen: fenoprofenate anion from Fenoprofen, im: imidazole). A therapeutic dose of 28 [*]mg/kg was tested for [Cu(fen) 2 (im) 2] and 21 [*]mg/kg was employed for Fenoprofen calcium, administered by oral gavage in female mice to compare the therapeutic properties of the new entity. The acetic acid induced writhing test was employed to study visceral pain. The percentage of inhibition in writhing and stretching was 78. 9 % and 46. 2 % for the [Cu(fen) 2 (im) 2] and Fenoprofen calcium, respectively. This result indicates that the complex could {{be more effective in}} diminishing visceral pain. The formalin test was evaluated to study the impact of the drugs over nociceptive and inflammatory pain. The complex is a more potent analgesic on inflammatory pain than the parent drug. Ulcerogenic effects were evaluated using a model of gastric lesions induced by hypothermic-restraint stress. Fenoprofen calcium salt caused an ulcer index of about 79 [*]mm 2 while the one caused by [Cu(fen) 2 (im) 2] was 22 [*]mm 2. The complex diminished the development of gastric mucosal ulcers in comparison to the uncomplexed drug.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{a critique}} of the notion of 'dialogue' in dialogue theory as espoused by Linell, Markova, and others building on Bakhtin’s writings. According to them, human communication, culture, language, and even cognition are dialogical in nature. This implies that these domains work by principles of other-orientation and interaction. In our paper, we reject accepting other-orientation as an a priori condition of every semiotic action. Instead, we claim that in order to be an empirically useful concept for the social sciences, it must be shown if and how observable action is other-oriented. This leads us to the following questions: how can we methodically account for other-orientation of semiotic action? Does other-orientation always imply interaction? Is every human expression oriented towards others? How does the other, as s/he is represented in semiotic <b>action,</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> the <b>properties</b> which the other can be seen to exhibit as indexed by their observable behavior? We study these questions by asking how the orientation towards others becomes evident in different forms of communication. For this concern, we introduce ‘recipient design’, ‘positioning’ and ‘intersubjectivity’ as concepts which allow us to inquire how semiotic action both takes the other into account and, reflexively, shapes him/her as an addressee having certain properties. We then specifically focus on actions and situations in which other-orientation is particularly problematic, such as interactions with children, animals, machines, or communication with unknown recipients via mass media. These borderline cases are scrutinized in order to delineate both limits and constitutive properties of other-orientation. We show that there are varieties of meaningful actions which do not exhibit an orientation towards the other, which do not rest on (the possibility of) interaction with the other or which even disregard what their producer can be taken to know about the other. Available knowledge about the other may be ignored in order to reach interactional goals, e. g. in strategical interactions or for concerns of socialization. If semiotic action is otherorientated, its design depends on how the other is available to and matters for their producer. Other-orientation may build on shared biographical experiences with the other, knowledge about the other as an individual and close attention to their situated conduct. However, other-orientation may also rest on (stereo-) typification with respect to institutional roles or group membership. In any case, others as they are represented in semiotic action can never be just others-as-such, but only othersas-perceived-by-the-actor. We conclude that the strong emphasis which dialogue theories put on otherorientation obscures that other-orientation is neither universal in semiotic action, that it must be distinguished from an interactive relationship, and that {{the ways in which the}} other figures in semiotic actions is not homogeneous in any of its most general properties. Instead, there is a huge variation in the ways in which the other can be taken into account. Therefore close scrutiny of how the other precisely figures in a certain kind of semiotic action is needed in order to lend the concept of ‘other-orientation’ empirical substance and a definite sense...|$|R
