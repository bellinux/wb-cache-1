5|$|After {{just one}} season with Texas, McCoy {{received}} a lot of media attention, including appearing on some lists of the nation's top players of 2007. In June 2007, McCoy appeared on the cover of Dave Campbell's Texas Football alongside Texas A quarterback Stephen McGee and TCU defensive end Tommy Blake.

5|$|At these speeds, it was {{expected}} that the B-70 would be almost immune to interceptor aircraft, the only effective weapon against bomber aircraft at the time. The bomber would spend only a few minutes over a particular radar station, flying out of its range before the controllers could position their fighters in a suitable location for an interception. High speed <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> aircraft difficult to see on radar displays and its high-altitude flight could not be matched by any contemporary Soviet fighter.|$|E

5|$|Nielsen did not record {{any of his}} works. However, three younger {{contemporary}} conductors who {{had worked}} with him, Thomas Jensen, Launy Grøndahl, and Erik Tuxen, did record his symphonies and other orchestral works with the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra between 1946 and 1952. Jensen <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> first LP recording of the Fifth Symphony in 1954. Work carried out by the recently published complete Carl Nielsen Edition has revealed that the scores used in these recordings often differ from the composer's original intentions and thus the supposed authenticity of these recordings is now debatable.|$|E
5|$|Shooting long {{scenes in}} a zero-g {{environment}} was a challenge. Eventually, the team {{decided to use}} computer-generated imagery for the spacewalk scenes and automotive robots to move Bullock's character for interior space station scenes. This meant that shots and blocking had to be planned well in advance for the robots to be programmed. It <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> production period much longer than expected. When the script was finalized, Cuarón assumed it would take about a year to complete the film, but it took {{four and a half}} years.|$|E
5|$|The Wreck {{experienced}} a major transition of ownership after the Centennial Celebration. Since Reck Club had financially maintained {{the vehicle for}} so long and Reck Club fell under the Dean of Students rather than the Athletic Association, the vehicle was sold from the Athletic Association to the Institute for zero dollars in 1987. The transaction further solidified Reck Club's responsibilities over the car but <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> car more than simply a football mascot. The Old Ford was officially an Institute icon.|$|E

5|$|Alcorn first {{examined}} Bushnell's schematics for Computer Space, {{but found}} them to be illegible. He went on to create his own designs based on his knowledge of transistor–transistor logic and Bushnell's game. Feeling the basic game was too boring, Alcorn added features to give the game more appeal. He divided the paddle into eight segments to change the ball's angle of return. For example, the center segments return the ball a 90° angle in relation to the paddle, while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles. He <b>also</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> ball accelerate the longer it remained in play; missing the ball reset the speed. Another feature was that the in-game paddles were unable to reach the top of screen. This was caused by a simple circuit that had an inherent defect. Instead of dedicating time to fixing the defect, Alcorn decided it gave the game more difficulty and helped limit the time the game could be played; he imagined two skilled players being able to play forever otherwise.|$|E
