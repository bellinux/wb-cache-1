The apoplastic fluid occupied 3 % of the stem volume; this approximates 3 tons of fluid/ha of the crop. This endogenous culture broth consisting of substrate and N 2 -fixing bacteria may be enough volume to account for earlier reports that some cultivars of sugarcane are independent of N fertilizers.

In this thesis, regulation of expression of genes encoding the most important ECF sigma factor SigH and its anti-sigma factor RshA as well as genes belonging to the SigH-regulon were mainly studied. The transcriptional analysis of the sigH-rshA operon revealed four housekeeping promoters of the sigH gene and one SigH-dependent promoter of the rshA gene.

In all clinical strains, ornithine was the diamino acid of the cell wall, the interpeptide bridge consisted of ornithine, and acetyl was the acyl type of the peptidoglycan. Therefore, the five clinical strains were unambiguously identified as Curtobacterium spp. Analyses of the complete 16 S rRNA genes of the five clinical strains with homologies to the established Curtobacterium species ranging from 99. 2 to 100 % confirmed the identifications as Curtobacterium spp. Data on the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of curtobacteria are reported, with macrolides and rifampin showing very low MICs for all strains tested.

Based on the complete genome sequence of a capnophilic succinic <b>acid-producing</b> rumen <b>bacterium,</b> Mannheimia succiniciproducens, gene knockout studies were carried out to understand its anaerobic fermentative metabolism and consequently to develop a metabolically engineered strain capable of producing succinic acid without by-product formation. Among three different CO 2 -fixing metabolic reactions catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase, PEP carboxylase, and malic enzyme, PEP carboxykinase was the most important for the anaerobic growth of M. succiniciproducens and succinic acid production. Oxaloacetate formed by carboxylation of PEP was found to be converted to succinic acid by three sequential reactions catalyzed by malate dehydrogenase, fumarase, and fumarate reductase. Major metabolic pathways leading to by-product formation were successfully removed by disrupting the ldhA, pflB, pta, and ackA genes. This metabolically engineered LPK 7 strain was able to produce 13. 4 g/liter of succinic acid from 20 g/liter glucose with little or no formation of acetic, formic, and lactic acids, resulting in a succinic acid yield of 0. 97 mol succinic acid per mol glucose. Fed-batch culture of M. succiniciproducens LPK 7 with intermittent glucose feeding allowed the production of 52. 4 g/liter of succinic acid, with a succinic acid yield of 1. 16 mol succinic acid per mol glucose and a succinic acid productivity of 1. 8 g/liter/h, which should be useful for industrial production of succinic acid...|$|R
40|$|The use of slower <b>acid-producing</b> starter <b>bacteria</b> for the {{production}} of lower fat Cheddar cheese has lead to milder flavor Cheddar cheeses that lack intense Cheddar notes. The metabolism of methionine leads to {{the production}} of methanethiol, {{which is one of the}} desirable Cheddar cheese flavor compounds. The influence of NaCl and reduced pH was determined for aminopeptidase, lipase/ esterase, and methanethiol-producing capability in selected lactic acid bacteria and brevibacteria in simulated cheese-like conditions. The activity of each enzyme decreased with NaCl addition and pH reduction to approximate a Cheddar cheese environment (5 % NaCl and pH 5. 2). The mechanism for methanethiol production by the starter and adjunct bacteria was also investigated. Different enzyme systems were found to be responsible for methanethiol production in starter lactococci, lactobacilli, and brevibacteria. In the lactococci, enzymes that acted primarily on cystathionine were responsible for methanethiol production from methionine. Lactobacilli also contained cystathionine-degrading enzymes, but these enzymes have properties different from the lactococcal enzymes. Brevibacterium linensBL 2 lacked cystathionine-degrading enzymes, but was capable of the direct conversion of methionine to methanethiol. L-Methionine γ-lyase from B. linens BL 2 was purified to homogeneity, and was found to catalyze the α, γ elimination of methionine resulting in the production of methanethiol, α-ketobutyrate, and ammonia. Characterization of the pure enzyme demonstrated that it is pyridoxal phosphate dependent, which is active at salt and pH conditions existing in ripening Cheddar cheese. The addition of either B. linens BL 2 or L-methionine γ-lyase to aseptic cheese curd slurries increased methanethiol and total volatile sulfur compound production. In an attempt to increase methanethiol production and Cheddar cheese flavor in reduced-fat Cheddar cheese, B. linens BL 2 was added as a starter adjunct to 60 % reduced-fat cheese. Sensory evaluation of the cheese indicated that B. linens BL 2 improved the flavor of 60 % reduced-fat Cheddar cheese. This suggests that the addition of B. linens BL 2 is an alternative to the addition of lactic acid bacteria to improve Cheddar cheese flavor via the metabolism of methionine...|$|R

Inappropriate disposal of these wastes by the methods such as dumping, land filling and incineration not only leads to environmental havoc but is also responsible for loss of useful biological resources such as protein, enzymes, etc. (Lasekan et al. 2013).

Each kind of fermentation bacteria has special fermentation types, such as propionic acid fermentation, butyric acid fermentation, ethanol fermentation or lactic acid fermentation, etc. When ecological factors change, fermentation bacteria will also change conversion rate of all terminal fermentation products through normal physiological regulation of organism even if fermentation-type does not change. Butyric acid-type fermentation type in acid-producing phase often occurs during two-phase anaerobic biological treatment. Terminal fermentation products of butyric acid-type fermentation usually contain a lot of propionic acid product. As a matter of fact, this is a consequence to adjust physiological metabolism equilibrium of fermentation bacteria. If ethanol is terminal product of liquid phase, effect of terminal product on normal metabolic process not only can be avoided, but also orderly fermentation can be obtained for oxidation–reduction. Hydrogen partial pressure in the reactor greatly influences ethanol conversion rate. It is known that ethanol can be accumulated only when hydrogen partial pressure is more than 104 Pa. When hydrogen partial pressure is below 104 Pa, ethanol will be converted to acetic acid. By control of fermentation bacteria at...|$|R
