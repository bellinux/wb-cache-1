5|$|After the {{contestant}} decides {{for which}} amount to play, the prize money is {{displayed on the}} gameboard. The contestant and chaser are presented with the same multiple choice question, and each locks in their answer, which cannot then be changed; the other has five seconds to answer after them, otherwise they <b>are</b> <b>locked</b> out and do not advance on the gameboard. For each question the contestant answers correctly, the prize money shown on the gameboard moves {{one step closer to}} the team bank. Similarly, the chaser moves one step closer to the contestant's prize money with each correct answer. Further questions are asked until the contestant reaches the end of the board (thus banking the prize money), or the chaser catches the contestant, eliminating them from the game. No movement is made by the contestant or the chaser if an incorrect answer is provided or if they <b>are</b> <b>locked</b> out by the time limit.|$|E
5|$|Discerning {{dynamical}} families {{within the}} Jupiter trojan population {{is more difficult}} {{than it is in}} the asteroid belt, because the Jupiter trojans <b>are</b> <b>locked</b> within a far narrower range of possible positions. This means that clusters tend to overlap and merge with the overall swarm. By 2003 roughly a dozen dynamical families were identified. Jupiter-trojan families are much smaller in size than families in the asteroid belt; the largest identified family, the Menelaus group, consists of only eight members.|$|E
5|$|In the station, {{the trains}} are {{oriented}} in a vertical position {{in order to}} allow riders to board. Once the restraints <b>are</b> <b>locked,</b> the train seats are rotated forward 90 degrees into a horizontal position and the train is then dispatched from the station. When the train returns to the station, the seats rotate back down and the riders disembark for the next guests.|$|E

5000|$|One enemy can <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> onto {{multiple}} times, but {{the number}} of times they can <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> on to depends on the amount of health remaining. For example, enemies with only 1 hit point can only <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> onto once.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Lock</b> files <b>are</b> often named with a tilde (...) prefixed to {{the name}} of the file they <b>are</b> <b>locking.</b> If they <b>are</b> <b>locking</b> a {{resource}} other than a file, they may be named more arbitrarily.|$|R
5|$|Dino Crisis {{features}} survival horror gameplay that is {{very similar}} to Capcom's early Resident Evil titles. Regina can walk, run, turn, backpedal, push and climb objects, and perform a 180-degree turn. A map is available which will show Regina's location, destination, save points, and locked doors. Save points are rooms which will prompt the player to save upon exiting them. Some doors <b>are</b> <b>locked</b> by a D.D.K. (digital disk key) device. To open these doors, the player will need both a code disc and input disc which can then be used to decipher a code and unlock the door. There are also force fields of red beams throughout the complex which can be activated to block access to intruders.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{travel to}} New York City to party with Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak). Ryan starts acting erratically, {{and it is}} {{revealed}} that he is {{under the influence of}} drugs. Meanwhile, the remaining employees are going to be forced to work on a Saturday. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) proposes that they work late on Friday, so {{they do not have to}} come in the next day. Once Jim and his co-workers finish working, they find that they <b>are</b> <b>locked</b> in, and everyone quickly places the blame on Jim.|$|E
5|$|In the station, Dive Coasters {{that use}} non-floorless trains simply use a {{standard}} station. With Dive Coasters that use floorless trains, {{in order to}} allow riders to load and unload the train, a movable floor is necessary. Because the front row has nothing in front of it to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints <b>are</b> <b>locked,</b> the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. When the next train enters the station, the gate is closed and the floors are brought back up where the next riders board.|$|E

50|$|XKB {{allows a}} {{modifier}} to <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> or latched, other than being in its regular state. Normally, a modifier is active exactly {{when it is}} pressed, like the Shift. However, a modifier may also <b>be</b> <b>locked,</b> like the Caps Lock modifier. When a modifier <b>is</b> <b>locked,</b> it remains active until it is explicitly deactivated. An intermediate condition between regular and <b>locked</b> <b>is</b> the latched state: When a modifier is latched, it remains active, but only until the next non-modifier key is pressed.|$|R

5|$|Although the {{gameplay}} is {{as that of}} Ruby and Sapphire, Emerald introduces new features. The plot is modified; both Team Magma and Aqua are villains who <b>are</b> <b>locked</b> in {{a constant}} gang war and awaken Groudon and Kyogre, respectively. When the two legendary Pokémon begin to battle each other, the protagonist must unleash the legendary Pokémon Rayquaza (pictured on the box cover) to calm them. Some of the game mechanics are changed as well. Though double battles were clearly marked in Ruby and Sapphire, in Emerald, two separate trainers might unite to battle as a pair. After the Elite Four is defeated, the player may re-battle Gym Leaders in a double battle if they are called on their PokéNav. Also, Pokémon sprites are animated in battle like they were in Pokémon Crystal. Probably the most significant addition is the Battle Frontier, an expanded version of the Battle Tower in Ruby and Sapphire.|$|E
5|$|During auditions for {{the school}} play, a romantic tension builds between Sunny and Zeke and {{they are asked to}} play the lead roles. Sunny quits the play when she realises that she has to kiss Zeke. Sunny then finds out that Zeke is 'Lost Boy', but she forgives him. When she sees Donna Freedman practising the kissing scene with Zeke, Sunny becomes upset. Sunny and Zeke almost share a kiss one night when they are alone. However, they are {{interrupted}} by Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine). Due to rewrites of the play, Sunny's new character has to kiss Zeke too and Sunny grows uncomfortable again. During drama camp, Sunny and Zeke <b>are</b> <b>locked</b> in a cupboard during a game of truth or dare. They almost kiss again, but are interrupted when the door is opened. Karl realises that Sunny and Zeke like each other and he tries to keep them apart. However, they eventually start a relationship.|$|E
5|$|Hyperion is Titan's nearest {{neighbor}} in the Saturn system. The two moons <b>are</b> <b>locked</b> in a 4:3 mean-motion resonance with each other, meaning that while Titan makes four revolutions around Saturn, Hyperion makes exactly three. With an average diameter of about 270km, Hyperion is smaller and lighter than Mimas. It has an extremely irregular shape, {{and a very}} odd, tan-colored icy surface resembling a sponge, though its interior may be partially porous as well. The average density of about 0.55g/cm3 indicates that the porosity exceeds 40% even assuming it has a purely icy composition. The surface of Hyperion is covered with numerous impact craters—those with diameters 2–10km are especially abundant. It is the only moon besides the small moons of Pluto known to have a chaotic rotation, which means Hyperion has no well-defined poles or equator. While on short timescales the satellite approximately rotates around its long axis {{at a rate of}} 72–75° per day, on longer timescales its axis of rotation (spin vector) wanders chaotically across the sky. This makes the rotational behavior of Hyperion essentially unpredictable.|$|E
5000|$|Doom did {{not have}} a higher frame rate than Wolfenstein 3D. It had a lower frame rate. (Doom <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> at 35 frames per second while Wolfenstein 3D <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> at 70 frames per second, a common {{vertical}} refresh rate in displays of that time).|$|R

5|$|ODST {{takes place}} in the 26th century, when humans under the command of the United Nations Space Command (UNSC) <b>are</b> <b>locked</b> in a war with a theocratic {{alliance}} of alien races known as the Covenant. During the events of the 2004 video game Halo 2, the Covenant discover the location of Earth and launch an assault on the city of New Mombasa in Africa. Though the UNSC manages to repel most of the fleet, a large ship hovers over the city, depositing an invasion force. The ship eventually retreats via a slipspace jump, creating a massive shockwave. While the rest of Halo 2s storyline follows the ship to an ancient installation identical to the first Halo, ODST focuses on the aftermath of the shockwave, while the Covenant still occupy the city.|$|E
5|$|Suddenly, Shawn and Gus <b>are</b> <b>locked</b> in {{the library}} and it is lit on fire, but they are rescued by Father Peter Westley (Ray Wise). Bob, who is {{revealed}} to be Paula's biological father, explains that after World War I, his great-grandfather established the town with two other soldiers, intending to create a secluded utopia. After the sawmill fire in 1958, the town began {{to look at all}} outsiders as a threat. When Doc Gooden and Sheriff Jackson enter and hold him at gunpoint, Shawn deduces that they are the leaders of the other two founding families. Due to Gooden's infertility and Jackson's terminal cancer, Randy was the only known direct descendant and therefore the sole future leader. To stop Randy from leaving town with a paranoid Paula, the sheriff and doctor drowned her. After Lassiter and O'Hara arrive and arrest Gooden and Jackson, the group celebrates at the diner, only to be repulsed by a number of oddities referencing Twin Peaks.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a Floorless Coaster has one main {{difference}} from traditional steel roller coasters around the world: it has no floors between the seats. While a train is in the station, a floor is used only for loading and unloading purposes. Because the front row has nothing {{in front of it}} to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints <b>are</b> <b>locked,</b> the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. The gate then opens, allowing the train to move forward. When the train returns to the station, the floor is brought back up and the gate is closed as the next riders board the roller coaster. Aside from the station, a Floorless Coaster has several inversions similar to B's Sitting Coasters.|$|E

50|$|On April 10, 2008, two Canadian {{secondary}} schools <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> down due to suspected firearm threats. George S. Henry Academy <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> down in Toronto, Ontario at approximately 2:00 p.m. The Emergency Task Force (TPS) were contacted and the lockdown lasted {{for more than}} two hours. New Westminster Secondary School <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> down in New Westminster, British Columbia at approximately 1:40 p.m. The Emergency Response Team (ERT) were called and the school was under lockdown until 4:30 p.m. Due {{to the size of the}} school some students were not able to leave until 7:00 p.m.|$|R
5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and <b>are</b> <b>locked</b> in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Elsa, {{princess of}} Arendelle and heiress to the throne, is {{born with the}} ability to create and control ice and snow. As a child, she uses her {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland to play in with her younger sister and best friend, Princess Anna. One night, Elsa accidentally harms Anna with her powers. The king and queen of Arendelle hurriedly take Anna to a tribe of mountain trolls to be healed. While healing Anna, the trolls inform the royals present that Elsa's abilities will grow, becoming both beautiful and very dangerous so she must learn to control them. While the trolls erase Anna's memory of the incident and of her elder sister's powers in general, Elsa is traumatized by the event. The king and queen take steps to control and hide Elsa's ice powers: the castle gates <b>are</b> <b>locked,</b> Elsa is shut away in her bedroom for most of the time, she is given gloves to help suppress her powers and is told to hold in her emotions as well. Nonetheless her powers continue to grow even stronger and so she becomes fearful of harming those she cares about most. Meanwhile, her sister Anna is less happy and confused by the loss of contact with her elder sister and tries, without success, to coax her out of her room. When the sisters grow into teenagers, the ship in which the king and queen are sailing is capsized in a storm and they drown, leaving Anna and Elsa feeling even more lonely.|$|E
5|$|The Spirit of Fire {{releases}} the new Halo, but faces immediate resistance upon {{it from the}} Banished. Back on the Ark, Alice-130 and Douglas-042 destroy enemy barricades and prevent reinforcements, including Atriox, from reaching the Halo; they then use the portal network to reach the Halo themselves. There, Professor Anders is escorted to the ring’s control room, where the firing system of the structure is deactivated and a signal beacon is set. Meanwhile, the Spirit of Fires forces <b>are</b> <b>locked</b> in a struggle with {{the remnants of the}} Banished. Anders finds the gravity controls for the Halo and uses them to raise the land that the remaining Banished are standing on into space where it disintegrates. The ground forces return to the Spirit of Fire, but Anders and the Halo enter slipspace as they cannot halt the jump's countdown. Before the Halo jumps, Anders promises to get help from the UNSC as soon as possible. On the Ark, Atriox and a legion of Banished still live, preparing for the next fight against the UNSC. Meanwhile, the Halo carrying Anders drops out of slipspace prematurely, only to encounter a Foreunner construct known as a Guardian.|$|E
30|$|The IR laser can <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> to the high-finesse IR cavity {{by using}} {{standard}} Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) locking techniques [83, 84]. Since the other optical modes for intra-cavity cooling in the high-finesse IR cavity are derived via EOMs and AOMs from the fundamental laser mode (see Section  7.2. 3), they also follow any {{changes of the}} cavity resonance frequency. In addition, these higher-order modes can in turn <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> to the cavity via PDH locking. We will also use an EOM to generate a mode to <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> to the IR + UV cavity. To this end, each of the modes to <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> to the cavities will separately be frequency modulated in the MHz range {{to allow for the}} generation of distinct PDH error signals from the light reflected from the cavity.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>locks</b> <b>were</b> derived for file databases, data is {{also shared}} in memory between {{processes}} and threads. Sometimes {{more than one}} object (or file) <b>is</b> <b>locked</b> at a time. If they <b>are</b> not <b>locked</b> simultaneously they can overlap, causing a deadlock exception.|$|R

5|$|For the game's {{character}} sculpting and rigging, {{the team}} introduced various new elements {{that were not}} used in their previous games. Lead character technical director Judd Simantov found {{that the creation of}} the faces was the most challenging, in terms of hardware. For the faces, the team used joint-based facial rigs, with some blend-shape correctives. To reta{{in the shape of the}} face and avoid awkward movement, the faces were rigged with the mouth open and eyes slightly closed. The faces were also based on the Facial Action Coding System, allowing for an anatomical-based approach. The use of a higher mesh density also allowed more volumes and creasing in the shape of the face, creating cleaner silhouettes and shapes and giving enough geometry to sculpt correctives. In an attempt to add subtle features, pupil dilation was added to the character models. For the bodies, the team edited the character movements from Uncharted 2, softening some joint alignment. The animation of carpal joints was also added for the game, allowing more dynamic hand shapes, and flexibility. Another subtle addition was the arm mover controls, allowing minor editing on the arms; though this feature was previously available, it was opened up to the animators for The Last of Us. A muscle system was also added, adding muscle shells that bulge, based on attachment joint distance; the muscle system, written in Maya within a few days, works in real time. To solve an issue in which body movement resulted in awkward movement of clothing, runtime helpers were implemented. A total of 326 joints were used in the full character model, with 98 of these in the face; 85 of these are runtime driven, while 241 <b>are</b> <b>locked</b> into animation.|$|E
