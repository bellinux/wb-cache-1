40|$|Background: Wound {{healing is}} a complex process, with many {{potential}} factors that can delay or complicate healing. Bacterial infection {{is one of the}} most dangerous complications once the skin barrier is destroyed. The search for optimal treatment of chronic and infected wounds is an ongoing challenge for healthcare professionals. Methods: This article discusses recent findings in the field of wound <b>antiseptics,</b> its antibacterial efficacy, cell toxicity, and compatibility with wound dressings. Results: Skin <b>antiseptics</b> are daily used for wound cleansing to reduce the bacterial burden. However, there is little evidence concerning the antimicrobial efficacy, cytotoxicity of host cells, and compatibility with commonly used wound dressings. Recent findings show high toxicity and significant incompatibilities with wound dressings for some <b>antiseptics.</b> Conclusion: <b>Antiseptics</b> are widely used in hospitals worldwide to reduce, inactivate, or eliminate potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Current studies show that widely used wound <b>antiseptics</b> show relevant cytotoxicity and cross-reactivity with certain wound dressings.

5|$|Bacterial infections may {{be treated}} with antibiotics, which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits {{a process that is}} different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by <b>antiseptic</b> measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.|$|E

5|$|Pericoronitis is {{inflammation}} of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower wisdom tooth is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap of gum (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which {{is an area that}} is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the tooth. There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an <b>antiseptic</b> solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.|$|E
