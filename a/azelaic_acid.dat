However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy. Several types of birth control pills help against acne in women. Isotretinoin pills are usually reserved for severe acne due to greater potential side effects.

All samples were semicrystalline and their thermal properties varied in a wide temperature range. Copolymers crystallized according to the monoclinic α-form of polybutylene succinate and the orthorhombic structure postulated for polybutylene azelate depending on the predominant dicarboxylate unit. The behavior of the copolymer with an intermediate composition was complex due to strong dependence of the predominant crystalline form on crystallization and processing conditions. Interestingly, crystallization into the azelate structure was favored when samples were rapidly cooled from the melt, resulting in an unexpected increase in the degree of crystallinity. Spherulitic morphologies were clearly different (i. e. ringed spherulites and axialites) depending on the preferential crystalline structure. Enzymatic degradability of the two homopolyesters was highly different and could be enhanced by incorporation of comonomer units. Preferential enzymatic attack on amorphous regions highlighted the spherulitic morphologies of copolymers having well developed, distinctive ringed structures.

40|$|Important {{aspects of}} cell cycle {{regulation}} are the checkpoints, which {{respond to a}} variety of cellular stresses to inhibit cell cycle progression and act as protective mechanisms to ensure genomic integrity. An increasing number of tumor suppressors are being demonstrated to have roles in checkpoint mechanisms, implying that checkpoint dysfunction {{is likely to be a}} common feature of cancers. Here we report that histone deacetylase inhibitors, in particular <b>azelaic</b> bishydroxamic <b>acid,</b> triggers a G 2 phase cell cycle checkpoint response in normal human cells, and this checkpoint is defective in a range of tumor cell lines. Loss of this G 2 checkpoint results in the tumor cells undergoing an aberrant mitosis resulting in fractured multinuclei and micronuclei and eventually cell death. This histone deacetylase inhibitor-sensitive checkpoint appears to be distinct from G 2 /M checkpoints activated by genotoxins and microtubule poisons and may be the human homologue of a yeast G 2 checkpoint, which responds to aberrant histone acetylation states. <b>Azelaic</b> bishydroxamic <b>acid</b> may represent a new class of anticancer drugs with selective toxicity based on its ability to target a dysfunctional checkpoint mechanism in tumor cells...|$|R
5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and <b>azelaic</b> <b>acid</b> (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E

Levoglucosan is the most abundant WSOCs in the urban and mountain atmosphere, whose accumulated concentrations in all stages are 1 – 3 orders of magnitude {{higher than those of}} marine aerosols. In contrast, malic, succinic and phthalic acids are dominant in the marine aerosols, which are 3 – 6 times more abundant than levoglucosan. This suggests that a continuous formation of secondary organic aerosols is occurring in the marine atmosphere during the long-range transport of air mass from inland China to the North Pacific. Sugars and sugar-alcohols, except for levoglucosan, gave a bimodal size distribution in the urban and mountain areas, peaking at 0. 7 – 1. 1 μm and > 3. 3 μm, and a unimodal distribution in the marine region, peaking at > 3. 3 μm. In contrast, levoglucosan and all the secondary WSOCs, except for benzoic and <b>azelaic</b> <b>acids,</b> showed a unimodal size distribution with a peak at 0. 7 – 1. 1 μm. Geometric mean diameters (GMDs) of the WSOCs in fine particles (< 2. 1 μm) at the urban site are larger in winter than in spring, due to an enhanced coagulation effect under the development of an inversion layer. However, GMDs of levoglucosan and most of the secondary WSOCs in the coarse mode are larger in the mountain and marine air and smaller in the urban air.

40|$|Histone deacetylase inhibitors show {{promise as}} {{chemotherapeutic}} agents {{and have been}} demonstrated to block proliferation {{in a wide range}} of tumor cell lines. Much of this antiproliferative effect has been ascribed to the up-regulated expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p 21 (WAF 1 /CIP 1). In this article, we report that p 21 expression was up-regulated by relatively low doses of the histone deacetylase inhibitor <b>azelaic</b> bishydroxamic <b>acid</b> (ABHA) and correlated with a proliferative arrest. Higher doses of ABHA were cytotoxic. Cells that did not up-regulate p 21 expression were hypersensitive to killing by ABHA and died via apoptosis, whereas up-regulation of p 21 correlated with reduced sensitivity and a block in the apoptotic mechanism, and these cells seemed to die by necrosis. Using isogenic p 21 (+/+) and p 21 (-/-) cell lines and direct inhibition of caspase activity, we demonstrate that the reduced sensitivity to killing by ABHA is a consequence of inhibition of apoptosis by up-regulated p 21 expression. These data indicate the enormous potential of therapeutic strategies that bypass the cytoprotective effect of p 21 and act on the same molecular targets as the histone deacetylase inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|Background. Posttransplant {{lymphoproliferative}} disease (PTLD), {{driven by the}} presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), is becoming an increasingly important clinical problem after solid organ transplantation. The use of immunosuppressive therapy leads to the inhibition of the cytotoxic T cells that normally control the EBV latently infected B cells. The prognosis for many patients with PTLD is poor, and the optimal treatment strategy is not well defined. Method. This study investigates the use of a histone deacetylase inhibitor, <b>azelaic</b> bishydroxamic <b>acid</b> (ABRA), for its ability to effectively kill EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines. Results. In vitro treatment of lymphoblastoid cell lines with ABRA showed that they were effectively killed by low doses of the drug (ID 50 2 - 5 mug/ml) within 48 hr. As well as being effective against polyclonal B-cell lines, ABHA was also shown to be toxic to seven of eight clonal Burkitt 2 ̆ 7 s lymphoma cell lines, indicating that the drug may also be useful in the treatment of late-occurring clonal PTLD. In addition, ABHA treatment did not induce EBV replication or affect EBV latent gene expression. Conclusion. These studies suggest that ABHA effectively kills both polyclonal and clonal B-cell lines and has potential in the treatment of PTLD...|$|R

The physical properties of each primary coconut oil emulsion (COE) were evaluated as percent creaming, theirs viscosity and particle sizes.
