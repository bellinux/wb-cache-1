The Independent on Sunday quoted Ramsay that the magazine [...] ".. always broke even, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> put the price up if it started losing money.

Robert McCrum in The Guardian quotes Ramsay as boasting that Lobster is [...] "the only left-wing journal {{to pay for}} itself".|$|E
500|$|According to author Amy Dempsey, {{during the}} Cold War, Rockwell's images affirmed {{traditional}} American values, depicting Americans as prosperous and free. Rockwell's work {{came to be}} categorized within art movements and styles such as Regionalism and American scene painting. Rockwell's work sometimes displays an idealized vision of America's rural and agricultural past. Rockwell summed up his own idealism: [...] "I paint life <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like it to be." ...|$|E

500|$|Joseph Sargent {{produced}} {{and directed the}} film. He had worked with Lorraine Gary in 1973's The Marcus-Nelson Murders, for which {{he won his first}} Directors Guild of America Award. Indeed, Steven Spielberg cites this television film, that later spawned Kojak, as motivation for casting Gary as Ellen Brody in the original Jaws film, besides the fact she was the wife of the studio's chief executive Sidney Sheinberg at that time. In regards to Revenge, Gary remarked in an interview: [...] "I made a good deal on this film, but I didn't make as good a deal <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have if I weren't married to Sid." ...|$|E
500|$|Olivier and Esmond {{married on}} 25 July 1930 at All Saints, Margaret Street, {{although}} within weeks both realised they had erred. Olivier later recorded {{that the marriage}} was [...] "a pretty crass mistake. I insisted on getting married from a pathetic mixture of religious and animal promptings.... She had admitted {{to me that she}} was in love elsewhere and could never love me as completely <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> wish". Olivier later recounted that following the wedding he did not keep a diary for ten years and never followed religious practices again, although he considered those facts to be [...] "mere coincidence", unconnected to the nuptials.|$|E

Special laws passed by the Parliaments of the Dominions finalised Edward's abdication the following day, or in Ireland's case one day later. On 11 December 1936, Edward said in a radio broadcast, [...] "I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility, and to discharge my duties as King <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> wish to do, without the help and support of the woman I love." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of 11 December 1936, Edward, now reverted to the title and style of a prince, {{explained}} his decision to abdicate in a worldwide radio broadcast. He famously said, [...] "I have {{found it impossible to}} carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love." [...] Edward departed Britain for Austria the following day; he was unable to join Simpson until her divorce became absolute, several months later. His brother, Prince Albert, Duke of York, succeeded to the throne as George VI. George VI's elder daughter, Princess Elizabeth, became heiress presumptive.|$|E
500|$|He {{eventually}} {{turned down}} talks with York {{and agreed to}} sign a one-year contract with fellow Conference team Mansfield Town on 19 May. On signing, Smith said [...] "It {{was time for a}} change after not getting as much football <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have liked. I'm still young, Mansfield are {{going in the right direction}} and I'm excited about the new season". He made his debut in the opening match of 2010–11, a 3–1 victory over Forest Green, and was substituted in the 80th minute. Smith scored his first goal for Mansfield in a 4–0 victory over Altrincham on 30 August. A red card in the 61st minute of a 1–0 defeat at Gateshead on 2 October for a high challenge resulted in a three match suspension. He finished the season with 38 appearances and six goals.|$|E

[...] Since October 2008, she has co-chaired Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a network of leading U.S. law firms that provide free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S. Founded in a collaboration between Jolie and the Microsoft Corporation, by 2013, KIND had become the principal provider of pro bono lawyers for immigrant children. Jolie had previously, from 2005 to 2007, funded the launch of a similar initiative, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants' National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children.|$|E

500|$|The Devastation class {{became more}} popular among the {{civilian}} population and in the Royal Navy as the ships got older. Rear-Admiral John Wilson, a former captain of the ship, stated in {{a meeting of the}} Royal United Services Institute discussing the most acceptable types of battleship in 1884, [...] "I also agree with my friend Captain Colomb that we have no type of ship to my fancy equal to the [...] or the good old Thunderer. Give me the Thunderer, the hull of the Thunderer; she had bad engines, she was not arranged <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like inside, she was badly gunned as we all know, and she had not enough light gun or sufficient armaments; but she carried [...] of coal, could steam at 10 knots from here to the Cape, and could fight any ship of her class on the salt water." ...|$|E

I feel I haven't played as much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> love to because of the great players we have at Barcelona". Fellow Barcelona player Giovanni van Bronckhorst was emotional as he won against his former club: [...] "It's special to win the final, and even more special to do it against your old team". Samuel Eto'o, scorer of Barcelona's first goal, cited Liverpool's comeback against Milan as inspiration for Barcelona's victory: [...] "After having seen what Liverpool did last year, we told ourselves not to throw in the towel. We followed Liverpool's example". Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard praised the role of goalkeeper Victor Valdés in their victory, stating {{that he made a}} number of important saves to keep them in the match: [...] "Valdes played a decisive role. He saved us at crucial moments".|$|E
500|$|The part of John Munch {{was based}} on Jay Landsman, a {{practical}} joker who was known in his homicide unit for his morbid wit. Both Belzer and the character Munch he portrays are cynical, caustic former hippies who are so similar that Belzer declared the character [...] "exactly <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be if I were a cop". Stanley Bolander was inspired by Detective Donald Worden who, like his on-screen counterpart, was nicknamed [...] "The Big Man". Ned Beatty only met Worden once before taking on the role, {{and he said the}} detective had [...] "an uncluttered mind and a near-photographic memory". Beau Felton {{was based on}} Detective Donald Kincaid, and Felton's clashes with Pembleton were based on Kincaid's real-life strong dislike for Harry Edgerton. Kay Howard was based in part on the female Detective Bert Silver, and in part on the male Detective Rich Garvey, who experienced a real-life string of good luck in solving consecutive cases, just as Howard did in the first season.|$|E

500|$|Joseph Desha, the {{outgoing}} governor, {{refused to believe}} that his party had lost the election. He disliked Metcalfe not only due to his party affiliation, {{but also because of}} his occupation as a stonemason, which he believed was too low a calling for a governor. Metcalfe's opponents made slights on the quality of his stone work and his views on the Old Court-New Court controversy. When told about these charges, Metcalfe remarked [...] "They may say what they like about my views, but the first man that dares to attack my character, I will cleave his skull with my stone hammer, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> cleave a rock." [...] As word of this remark spread, Metcalfe was given the nickname [...] "Old Stone Hammer." [...] Despite his threats to remain in the governor's mansion until the legislature convened, Desha respected the will of the people, and left the residence on September 2, 1828.|$|E
500|$|Most of the Breckinridges were Whigs, but John Breckinridge's posthumous {{influence}} inclined {{his grandson}} toward the Democratic Party. Additionally, John C. Breckinridge's friend and law partner, Thomas W. Bullock, {{was from a}} Democratic family. In 1842, Bullock told Breckinridge {{that by the time}} they opened their practice in Burlington, Iowa, [...] "you were two-thirds of a Democrat"; living in heavily Democratic Iowa Territory further distanced him from Whiggery. He wrote weekly editorials in the Democratic Iowa Territorial Gazette and Advisor, and in February 1843, he was named to the Des Moines County Democratic committee. A letter from Breckinridge's brother-in-law related that, when Breckinridge's uncle William learned that his nephew had [...] "become loco-foco", he said, [...] "I felt <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have done if I had heard that my daughter had been dishonored." [...] On a visit to Kentucky in 1843, Breckinridge met and married Mary Cyrene Burch, ending his time in Iowa.|$|E
500|$|The Four Freedoms {{are perhaps}} Rockwell's most famous work. Some {{have said that}} Rockwell's Four Freedoms lack artistic maturity. [...] Others have pointed to the {{universality}} of the Freedom of Religion as disconcerting to practitioners of particular faiths. [...] Others complained that he idealized American life because by depicting wholesome, healthy, and happy sentiments, Rockwell depicted the good that was remembered or wished for, but by avoiding misery, poverty, and social unrest, he failed to demonstrate command of {{the bad and the}} ugly parts of American life. Rockwell's response to this criticism was, [...] "I paint life <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like it to be." [...] Rockwell made it known that he hoped these would be his masterpieces, but was disappointed. Nonetheless, he was satisfied with the public acceptance of the series and that the series was able to serve such a patriotic purpose. Laura Claridge feels he might have achieved his ambition if he had pursued the [...] "quiet small scenes" [...] he later became known for.|$|E

500|$|Breckinridge {{remained}} in Lexington while deciding {{where to begin}} practice, borrowing law books from the library of John J. Crittenden, Thomas Crittenden's father. Deciding that Lexington was overcrowded with lawyers, he moved to Frankfort, {{but was unable to}} find an office. After being spurned by a love interest, he and former classmate Thomas W. Bullock departed for the Iowa Territory on October 10, 1841 seeking better opportunities. Journeying westward, they considered settling on land Breckinridge had inherited in Jacksonville, Illinois, but they found the bar stocked with able men like Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln. They continued on to Burlington, Iowa, and by the winter of 1842–1843, Breckinridge reported to family members that his firm handled more cases than almost any other in Burlington. Influenced by Bullock and the citizens of Iowa, he identified with the Democratic Party, and by February 1843, he had been named to the Democratic committee of Des Moines County. Most of the Kentucky Breckinridges were Whigs, and when he learned of his nephew's party affiliation, William Breckinridge declared, [...] "I felt <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have done if I had heard that my daughter had been dishonored." ...|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} [...] "C", writing that {{it felt like}} [...] "a frantic attempt to raise a bunch of {{potential}} storylines for season two and an attempt to put things {{in place for the}} season finale". He criticized the show's lack of continuity, particularly with regard to the Jesse and Rachel storyline. Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack also observed the lack of continuity in the Jesse storyline, calling it [...] "slightly confusing" [...] and [...] "a little half-baked"; continuity errors in his storyline may have been the result of the change in episode broadcast order. He felt that the episode was [...] "a slight let down", noting: [...] "There wasn’t as much tension <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have hoped going into the finale but there were still plenty of fun moments to enjoy." [...] James Poniewozik of Time attributed part of the episode's problems to it being [...] "an episode that could air easily out of order", explaining: [...] "Glee is a very serial show, after all, but this episode largely consisted of moments that felt dropped in and random, in a way that undermined even the good moments." ...|$|E

But I am so incensed against the oppresions from England, and have so little regard to the laws they make, that I do, as a clergyman, encourage the merchants both to export wool and woollen manufactures to any country in Europe, or anywhere else, and conceal it from the Custom-house officers, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> hide my purse from a highwayman, if he came to rob me on the road, although England hath made a law to the contrary; and so I would encourage our booksellers here to sell your author's books printed here, and send them to all the towns in England, if I could do it with safety and profit; because I repeat, it is no offence against God, or the laws of the country I live in.|$|E
