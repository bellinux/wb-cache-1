Influence of nonlinear distortions and interference in <b>active</b> <b>antennas</b> on the overall system performance is considered. Modeling and simulation techniques, which {{can be applied to}} <b>active</b> array <b>antennas,</b> are substantially different from those used for circuits and systems. System-level simulation techniques are considered in detail with special emphasis on their application to <b>active</b> array <b>antennas.</b> “Instantaneous ” quadrature technique is proposed as an effective tool for numerical simulation of active arrays over wide frequency and dynamic ranges in a computationally-effective way. The validity of this technique is demonstrated through comparison with harmonic balance simulation and measurements. The new Bell Labs ultimate limit for channel capacity and its influence on active array technology and simulation techniques are considered. For the past 20 years the situation in the area of antenna theory and technology has changed dramatically. One important part of this change is an extensive use of <b>active</b> <b>antennas,</b> especially <b>active</b> array <b>antennas</b> [1 - 11]. <b>Active</b> <b>antennas</b> in general remain an area of great innovation until now and will remain up to the foreseeable future.

50|$|An <b>active</b> <b>antenna</b> is {{an antenna}} that {{contains}} active electronic components such as transistors, {{as opposed to}} most antennas which only consist of passive components such as metal rods, capacitors and inductors. <b>Active</b> <b>antenna</b> designs allow antennas of limited size to have a wider frequency range (bandwidth) than passive antennas, and are primarily used in situations where a larger passive antenna is either impractical (inside a portable radio) or impossible (suburban residential area that disallows use of large outdoor low-frequency antennas).|$|E
50|$|They {{all have}} masts or towers to install antenna systems. In {{most cases the}} mast is a passive {{structure}} to support the antennas. But in low frequency stations (such as AM radio) the mast itself may be the <b>active</b> <b>antenna</b> element. In such cases, the mast is isolated from the ground.(See Monopole antenna). If the mast itself is an <b>active</b> <b>antenna</b> element the ground can be covered by a mesh of wires or metal elements to create a reflecting ground. Most of the stations also have facility to receive microwave signals from a microwave link or a telecommunications satellite, (TVRO or RRO).|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that in terms of the ergodic capacity, the optimum {{transmit}} strategy is to allocate equal power to all transmit antennas. In this work, we show that the transmit strategy to equally allocate power to all antennas is not the optimal one. The optimum strategy is to avoid using all available antennas. The optimal number of <b>active</b> <b>antennas</b> depends on the required rate and the SNR. We propose an algorithm which computes the optimum number of <b>active</b> <b>antennas</b> for given available number of transmit antennas, SNR, and rate R.

The BS power consumption consists of two parts: The part accounting for the total transmit power and the part proportional {{to the number of}} <b>active</b> <b>antennas.</b> Specifically, closed-form approximations (CFAs) of the optimal transmit power and optimal number of <b>active</b> <b>antennas</b> are derived when the sum rate requirement is high.

40|$|Abstract]: We {{propose a}} new {{generalised}} spatial modulation (GSM) technique, {{which can be}} considered as a generalisation of the recently proposed spatial modulation (SM) technique. SM {{can be seen as a}} special case of GSM with only one <b>active</b> transmit <b>antenna.</b> In contrast to SM, GSM uses the indices of multiple transmit antennas to map information bits, and is thus able to achieve substantially increased spectral efficiency. Furthermore, selecting multiple <b>active</b> transmit <b>antennas</b> enables GSM to harvest significant transmit diversity gains in comparison to SM, because all the <b>active</b> <b>antennas</b> transmit the same information. On the other hand, inter-channel interference (ICI) is completely avoided by transmitting the same symbols through these <b>active</b> <b>antennas.</b> We present theoretical analysis using order statistics for the symbol error rate (SER) performance of GSM. The analytical results are in close agreement with our simulation results. The bit error rate performance of GSM and SM is simulated and compared, which demonstrates the superiority of GSM. Moreover, GSM systems with configurations of different transmit and receive antennas are studied. Our results suggest that using a less number of transmit antennas with a higher modulation order will lead to better BER performance...|$|R
