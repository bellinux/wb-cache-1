Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was <b>answered</b> correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her <b>answered</b> correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly <b>answered</b> their question {{at the end of the}} tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{investigate}} {{the interplay between}} <b>answer</b> quality and <b>answer</b> speed across question types in community question-answering sites (CQAs). The research questions addressed are the following: (a) How do <b>answer</b> quality and <b>answer</b> speed vary across question types? (b) How do the relationships between <b>answer</b> quality and <b>answer</b> speed vary across question types? (c) How do the best quality <b>answers</b> and the fastest <b>answers</b> differ in terms of <b>answer</b> quality and <b>answer</b> speed across question types? (d) How do trends in <b>answer</b> quality vary over time across question types? From the posting of 3, 000 questions in six CQAs, 5, 356 <b>answers</b> were harvested and analyzed. There {{was a significant difference}} in <b>answer</b> quality and <b>answer</b> speed across question types, and there were generally no significant relationships between <b>answer</b> quality and <b>answer</b> speed. The best quality <b>answers</b> had better overall <b>answer</b> quality than the fastest <b>answers</b> but generally took longer to arrive. In addition, although the trend in <b>answer</b> quality had been mostly random across all question types, the quality of <b>answers</b> appeared to improve gradually when given time. By highlighting the subtle nuances in <b>answer</b> quality and <b>answer</b> speed across question types, this study is an attempt to explore a territory of CQA research that has hitherto been relatively uncharted...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a language-independent probabilistic <b>answer</b> ranking framework for question <b>answering.</b> The framework estimates {{the probability of}} an individual <b>answer</b> candidate given the degree of <b>answer</b> relevance {{and the amount of}} supporting evidence provided in the set of <b>answer</b> candidates for the question. Our approach was evaluated by comparing the candidate <b>answer</b> sets generated by Chinese and Japanese <b>answer</b> extractors with the re-ranked <b>answer</b> sets produced by the <b>answer</b> ranking framework. Empirical results from testing on NT-CIR factoid questions show a 40 % performance improvement in Chinese <b>answer</b> selection and a 45 % improvement in Japanese <b>answer</b> selection. ...|$|R

40|$|Community Question <b>Answering</b> (QA) portals contain {{questions}} and <b>answers</b> contributed {{by hundreds of}} millions of users. These databases of {{questions and}} <b>answers</b> are of great value if they can be used directly to <b>answer</b> questions from any user. In this research, we address this collaborative QA task by drawing knowledge from the crowds in community QA portals such as Yahoo! <b>Answers.</b> Despite their popularity, {{it is well known that}} <b>answers</b> in community QA portals have unequal quality. We therefore propose a quality-aware framework to design methods that select <b>answers</b> from a community QA portal considering <b>answer</b> quality in addition to <b>answer</b> relevance. Besides using <b>answer</b> features for determining <b>answer</b> quality, we introduce several other quality-aware QA methods using <b>answer</b> quality derived from the expertise of answerers. Such expertise can be question independent or question dependent. We evaluate our proposed methods using a database of 95 K questions and 537 K <b>answers</b> obtained from Yahoo! <b>Answers.</b> Our experiments have shown that <b>answer</b> quality can improve QA performance significantly. Furthermore, question dependent expertise based methods are shown to outperform methods using <b>answer</b> features only. It is also found that there are also good <b>answers</b> not among the best <b>answers</b> identified by Yahoo! <b>Answers</b> users...|$|R

Therefore, an incorrect, but plausible, <b>answer</b> is withdrawn (however, nothing guarantees that the other un-eliminated <b>answer</b> is the correct <b>answer,</b> because contestants may not have indicated the correct <b>answer</b> among the 2 <b>answers</b> that they consider most plausible).

40|$|Along {{with the}} {{proliferation}} of the social web, question and <b>answer</b> (QA) sites attract millions of users around the globe.

Improvement is achieved by having multiple <b>answers</b> to any given question instead of a singe <b>answer,</b> and through a mechanism of <b>answer</b> evaluation, by which users rank the best <b>answer</b> to any given question.

50|$|An <b>answer</b> {{given by}} a student is ruled correct or {{incorrect}} by the moderator. On short <b>answer</b> questions, if the <b>answer</b> given differs from the official one, the moderator uses his or her judgment to make a ruling (which is subject to a challenge by the competitors). On multiple choice questions, the <b>answer</b> given by the student is only correct if it matches the official <b>answer</b> exactly. Alternatively, the student may give the letter choice that corresponds to the correct <b>answer.</b> Although A, B, C, and D were once used as <b>answer</b> choice letters, W, X, Y, and Z are now favored due to a lower chance of confusion. On short <b>answers,</b> the <b>answer</b> {{does not have to}} exactly match the official <b>answer,</b> so any given <b>answer</b> that roughly means the same as the official <b>answer</b> is accepted.|$|R
