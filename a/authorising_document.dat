40|$|Background: Spain has {{recently}} become an inward migration country. Little {{is known about}} the occupational health of immigrant workers. This study aimed to explore the perceptions that immigrant workers in Spain had of their working conditions. /nMethods: Qualitative, exploratory, descriptive study. Criterion sampling. Data collected between September 2006 and May 2007 through semi-structured focus groups and individual interviews, with a topic guide. One hundred and fifty-eight immigrant workers (90 men/ 68 women) from Colombia (n = 21), Morocco (n = 39), sub-Saharan Africa (n = 29), Romania (n = 44) and Ecuador (n = 25), who were <b>authorised</b> (<b>documented)</b> or unauthorised (undocumented) residents in five medium to large cities in Spain. /nResults: Participants described poor working conditions, low pay and health hazards. Perception of hazards appeared to be related to gender and job sector. Informants were highly segregated into jobs by sex, however, so this issue will need further exploration. Undocumented workers described poorer conditions than documented workers, which they attributed to their documentation status. Documented participants also felt vulnerable because of their immigrant status. Informants believed that deficient language skills, non-transferability of their education and training and, most of all, their immigrant status and economic need left them with little choice but to work under poor conditions. /nConclusions: The occupational health needs of immigrant workers must be addressed at the job level, while improving the enforcement of existing health and safety regulations. The roles that documentation status and economic need played in these informants' work experiences should be considered and how these may influence health outcomes...|$|R

Deploying Bacchi’s application of contested concepts, problem representation and their place in public policy development and implementation, {{it is argued that}} quality plays an important systemic transactional function. In addition to serving as a more traditional warranty of skills transfer and acquisition, quality facilitates the operation of a highly complex system by providing a field of contestation, allowing a variety of national organisations to manoeuvre, exert influence and seek control over vocational education and training. This discourse analysis of the contents of key 2013 <b>documents,</b> <b>authorised</b> by four national training system institutions, produced two results. One demonstrates the contested nature of quality – something claiming a singular fixed meaning, but actually showing multiple realities.

40|$|Informatisation of {{the private}} and public sector is a {{significant}} social phenomenon whose first wave was noted in the 1990 s. With the gradual development and availability of ICT means, traditional personal or post communication has been replaced by electronic correspondence because of the user´s comfort as well as financial savings. The Czech strategy of information society formation is represented e. g. by the e-Government Project whose key tool is electronic communication via data boxes. The Act No. 300 / 2008 Coll. On Electronic Acts and <b>Authorised</b> Conversion of <b>Documents</b> establishes data boxes for public authorities, legal entities formed by the law, legal entities incorporated in the Commercial Register and trustees in bankruptcy. After a three-month transitional trial period, since November 1, 2009, communication via data boxes is carried out reciprocally among public authorities {{and in the case of}} service by public authorities to other users of data boxes. Other entities than public authorities do not thus have the duty to send documents from their data boxes. Compulsory establishment of data boxes is often criticized mainly by the private sector as many enterpreneurs perceive them as a means of carrying over costs of public authority to private entities. As problematic issues are viewed especially the duty of frequent password changes and the fact that data boxes are only short-term deposits of data messages...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} of social action opposed to particular Australian government policies. The policies concerned are those affecting people seeking asylum without <b>authorised</b> entry <b>documents.</b> The period examined is from 2001 to 2006. It is argued that the social action contributed to the achievement of shifts in public opinion and policy during this period. The context in which this local action is examined is the international system of asylum, and the responses of developed countries to flows of incoming asylum seekers. Political rhetoric has often demonised those seeking asylum, and the term 'asylum seeker' increasingly has negative connotations for many people in developed countries. At the same time, groups of people in asylum destination countries such as Australia, have also responded with support and assistance for asylum seekers. Using ethnographic methodology and drawing on theories from refugee studies, and collective action and social movement theory, this thesis explores {{the nature of this}} particular response. Interviews were conducted with more than 90 people from across Australia, who opposed government policies which criminalised and excluded asylum seekers. In contrast, these people were involved in advocacy and support. Analysis of these interviews reveals the complex interactions amongst and between asylum seekers, advocates, activists, and government. Motivations and emotions of social action are examined in the study, as are tensions over objectives and strategies, and the construction of collective experience and identity. The analysis illustrates the impact of the activism of the asylum seekers themselves upon the social action in terms of interactions, relationships and joint actions between asylum seekers and citizens. The thesis finds practical and symbolic resonances within the social action, which transcend the particularity of the Australian situation. From this, the potential for a human-to-human dimension of common humanity to build connections between privileged and excluded peoples, is theorised. Through this exploration, contributions are made to both refugee studies literature and to collective action and social movement literature. The research illustrates the impact upon both areas, of the wider structures of globalisation. Conversely, it also illustrates the way in which local action can provide innovative paths for wider social actions and visions...|$|R
5|$|While Richard {{was still}} in Sicily, word reached {{the king of the}} {{disputes}} between William Longchamp, whom Richard had left in England, and John, Richard's younger brother. On 2 April 1191 Richard sent Coutances back from Sicily to England. The archbishop landed in England on 27 June, after a short detour to Rome. Coutances received a release from his crusading vow, and returned to England in the company of Richard's mother, Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. He had a number of royal <b>documents</b> <b>authorising</b> him to settle the disputes, and on 28 July a settlement was reached that left Longchamp in control, although John still retained sufficient power to make Longchamp's grip on the government somewhat insecure. In September, however, Longchamp imprisoned Richard's bastard half-brother, Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, who was attempting to return to England after having been banished by the king. The imprisonment renewed memories of the murder of Thomas Becket almost 20years earlier, and Geoffrey was quickly released. Longchamp was brought to a council, headed by Coutances and a number of the clerical and lay lords of England, which took place on 5 October 1191 at Loddon Bridge on the River Thames. Longchamp was deposed and exiled, largely because Coutances had a royal document ordering the magnates to obey Coutances' if the archbishop's advice was resisted by Longchamp, which it had been. Although the medieval chronicler Richard of Devizes accused Coutances of duplicity, and of trying to play both sides against the other, the evidence suggests that Coutances was genuinely trying to solve the dispute in the king's interest. Longchamp fled to Normandy, and he was excommunicated by Coutances.|$|R
