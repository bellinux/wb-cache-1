40|$|The {{inspection}} of high voltage power transmission lines is mainly {{carried out by}} manned aerial vehicles or foot patrol. However, these maintenance methodologies for inspection are somehow inefficient and expensive. Moreover, helicopter assisted inspection endangers the human life.

In this paper, we present an unmanned aerial system based on the quadrotor helicopter for high voltage power line inspection. Our interest is to equip the quadrotor helicopter with the necessary payload {{in order to be able}} to carry out a qualitative inspection, therefore the hardware architecture of the <b>aerial</b> <b>robotic</b> <b>system</b> is presented.

40|$|It is {{frequently}} {{claimed that the}} students must have {{an active role in}} building and transforming their own knowledge, and the teacher's labor is to provide the students the necessary tools in order to reach specific learning objectives, included in a course program. This paper presents an <b>aerial</b> <b>robotic</b> <b>system</b> as a toolkit, and proposes a series of activities focused on the learning in automation and robotics. These proposed activities have been designed based upon the project-based learning methodology, and they facilitate the achievement of the learning objectives presented by Spanish automation committee(CEA) in conjunction with The International Society of Automation (ISA) to satisfy the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) standard. The toolkit and the activities are oriented to impulse the practical teaching, giving the student additional motivation and, in consequence, improving his or her active role. Besides, the toolkit and the activities give the teacher a tool in which it is possible to assess the students learning process.

40|$|International audienceFlight {{performance}} of <b>aerial</b> <b>robotic</b> vehicles is critically {{dependent on the}} quality of the state estimates provided by onboard sensor systems. The attitude estimation problem has been extensively studied over the last ten years and the development of low complexity, high performance, robust non-linear observers for attitude has been one of the enabling technologies fueling the growth of small scale <b>aerial</b> <b>robotic</b> <b>systems.</b> The velocity aided attitude estimation problem, that is simultaneous estimation of attitude and linear velocity of an aerial platform, has only been tackled using the non-linear observer approach in the last few years. Prior contributions have lead to non-linear observers for which either there is no stability analysis or for which the analysis is extremely complex. In this paper, we propose a simple relaxation of the state space, allowing scaled rotation matrices R ∈ R^ 3 × 3 such that RX^= uI where X = uR and u > 0 is a positive scalar, along with additional observer dynamics to force u → 1 asymptotically. With this simple augmentation of the observer state space, we propose a non-linear observer with a straightforward Lyapunov stability analysis that demonstrates almost global asymptotic convergence along with local exponential convergence. Simulations as well as experimental results are provided to demonstrate the {{performance of}} the proposed observer...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we define}} a general class of {{abstract}} <b>aerial</b> <b>robotic</b> <b>systems</b> named Laterally Bounded Force (LBF) vehicles, {{in which most}} of the control authority is expressed along a principal thrust direction, while in the lateral directions a (smaller and possibly null) force may be exploited to achieve full-pose tracking. This class approximates well platforms endowed with non-coplanar/non-collinear rotors that can use the tilted propellers to slightly change the orientation of the total thrust w. r. t. the body frame. For this broad class of systems, we introduce a new geometric control strategy in SE(3) to achieve, whenever made possible by the force constraints, the independent tracking of position-plus-orientation trajectories. The exponential tracking of a feasible full-pose reference trajectory is proven using a Lyapunov technique in SE(3). The method can deal seamlessly with both under- and fully-actuated LBF platforms. The controller guarantees the tracking of at least the positional part in the case that an unfeasible full-pose reference trajectory is provided. The paper provides several experimental tests clearly showing the practicability of the approach and the sharp improvement with respect to state of-the-art approaches...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} WITAS Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Project is {{to develop}} a fully {{autonomous}} UAV that will be used as an experimental platform for conducting research related to civil UAV applications. One of the activities in this project is the development of a generic distributed deliberative/reactive software architecture for (<b>aerial)</b> <b>robotic</b> <b>systems.</b> One part of this software architecture is called the Modular Task Architecture (MTA) that provides a framework for distributed <b>robotic</b> <b>systems.</b> MTA defines the behavioral restrictions and the interface of so called Task Procedures (TPs) which can be seen as goal-based and reactive implementations for performing tasks. MTA uses the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) as the middleware for “gluing”the distributed system together. MTA’s behavioral restrictions for TPs are complex and therefore a special language was developed to make the creation of TPs less difficult. This language is called the Task Specification Language (TSL) and it simplifies the development of TPs by letting the developers omit many of the details of CORBA and MTA. But these details must be inserted at a later stage {{with the help of a}} translator. The purpose of this master’s thesis was to develop a translator which would be capable of translating TPs written in TSL into an implementation. This implementation should be expressed in a standard programming language such as Java or C++. A flexible translator was developed by using XML technologies for specifying and transforming TSL specifications. The functionalities of the translator and the grammar of TSL can be extended with the help of parameter files. This feature contributes to the flexibility of the system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Most robot {{control and}} {{planning}} algorithms are complex, involving {{a combination of}} reactive controllers, behavior-based controllers, and deliberative controllers. The switching between different behaviors or controllers makes such systems hybrid, i. e. combining discrete and continuous dynamics. While proofs of convergence, robustness and stability are often available for simple controllers under a carefully crafted set of operating conditions, there is no systematic approach to experimenting with, testing, and validating the performance of complex hybrid control systems. In this paper we {{address the problem of}} generating sets of conditions (inputs, disturbances, and parameters) that might be used to ”test ” a given hybrid system. We use the method of Rapidly exploring Random Trees (RRTs) to obtain test inputs. We extend the traditional RRT, which only searches over continuous inputs, to a new algorithm, called the Rapidly exploring Random Forest of Trees (RRFT), which can also search over time invariant parameters by growing a set of trees for each parameter value choice. We introduce new measures for coverage and tree growth that allows us to dynamically allocate our resources among the set of trees and to plant new trees when the growth rate of existing ones slows to an unacceptable level. We demonstrate the application of RRFT to testing and validation of <b>aerial</b> <b>robotic</b> control <b>systems.</b> ...|$|R
