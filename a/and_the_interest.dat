5|$|The first Hindu {{teacher to}} {{actively}} advocate and disseminate aspects of yoga to a western audience, Swami Vivekananda, toured Europe and the United States in the 1890s. The reception which Swami Vivekananda received {{built on the}} active interest of intellectuals, in particular the New England Transcendentalists, among them Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882), who drew on German Romanticism <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> of philosophers and scholars like G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831), the brothers August Wilhelm Schlegel (1767–1845) and Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel (1772–1829), Max Mueller (1823–1900), Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860), and others who had (to varying degrees) interests in things Indian.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{the royal}} touch {{promoted}} {{the power of the}} monarchy, but the ceremony was seldom performed in the 16th century. During the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598), the worsening conditions helped scrofula spread more than ever <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> in the disease steadily increased. The Catholic League started a propaganda claiming that Henry III (r. 1574–1589) was unable to heal by touch due to his immorality. After the assassination of Henry III and accession of the Protestant Henry IV (r. 1589–1610), the League warned that God would revoke his gift if the French accepted a Protestant as their sovereign and that the scrofulous would never be cured again.|$|E
5|$|The {{levelized cost}} of {{electricity}} (LCoE) can be calculated by dividing the total cost to build and operate a power-generating system over its lifetime by {{the total amount of}} electricity shipped to the grid during that period. The amount of money is essentially a combination of the capital expense (CAPEX) of the plant <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> payments on that CAPEX, and the discounted cost of the fuel, the maintenance needed to keep it running and its dismantling, the discounted operational expenses, or OPEX. The amount of power is normally calculated by considering the peak power the plant could produce, and then adjusting that by the capacity factor (CF) to account for downtime due to maintenance or deliberate throttling. As a quick calculation, one can ignore inflation, opportunity costs and minor operational expenses to develop a figure of merit for the {{cost of electricity}}.|$|E

25|$|Having been re-elected in 1971 on a {{nationalisation}} platform, Gandhi {{proceeded to}} nationalise the coal, steel, copper, refining, cotton textiles, and insurance industries.

25|$|Sharp became {{interested}} in traditional English dance {{when he saw a}} group of morris dancers with their concertina player William Kimber at the village of Headington Quarry, just outside Oxford, at Christmas 1899.

25|$|Rural loans {{commonly}} arose as {{a result}} of unpaid obligations due to an institution (such as a temple), in this case the arrears were considered to be lent to the debtor.

25|$|In {{reference}} to the 18th and early 19th centuries, Vaillant mentioned in passing the start of Habsburg rule in Transylvania, the Greek-Catholic conversions among Romanians {{in exchange for the}} unfulfilled promise of political rights, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> Moise Nicoară had taken in the French Revolution. Quoting George Bariţ, a major figure of the Transylvanian School, he noted that most Transylvanians were Romanian (1.2 million, as opposed to the 900,000 members of all other ethnicities), and recounted his own dissemination of unification ideals among Transylvanian expatriates in Wallachia.|$|E
25|$|Inflation-indexed bonds (linkers) (US) or Index-linked bond (UK), {{in which}} the {{principal}} amount <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> payments are indexed to inflation. The interest rate is normally lower than for fixed rate bonds with a comparable maturity (this position briefly reversed itself for short-term UK bonds in December 2008). However, as the principal amount grows, the payments increase with inflation. The United Kingdom was the first sovereign issuer to issue inflation linked gilts in the 1980s. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and I-bonds are examples of inflation linked bonds issued by the U.S. government.|$|E
25|$|The second school {{house was}} built in 1855, and was a two-story frame, with rooms for two departments. In 1876 Joel Parkhurst {{proposed}} to give the district a new brick school house, costing $4,000, provided the people would raise a fund of $1,500, to be placed at interest <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> used to keep the house in order and purchase apparatus. The offer was accepted and the building erected. It ranks as third among the school houses of the county. Prof. M. F. Cass has been principal of this school since 1891, and has proven himself an able, efficient and popular educator.|$|E

25|$|A plan of George Loddiges' {{arboretum}} {{was included}} in The Encyclopaedia of Gardening 1834 edition, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> this aroused helped inspire Loudon to write his encyclopaedic book Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum, first published in 1838. Although this incorporated drawings from several early botanic gardens and parklands throughout the UK, it relied greatly upon, {{and would not have}} been possible without, George Loddiges' well labeled arboretum. It was on the collection maintained by this firm more than any other that J.C.Loudon relied for living material in the preparation of his great work W.J.Bean notes in Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles, today's standard reference work.|$|E
25|$|Thomas {{was later}} {{to return to}} England {{to serve as a}} {{minister}} under the Commonwealth of England and the Protectorate. Nathan Paget, his son and John's nephew, had already returned to pursue his career as a physician and lived in London throughout the English Civil War. He sustained the contacts with polyglot and polymath circles <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> in Hebrew he had acquired from his uncle. He married Elizabeth Cromwell, cousin of Oliver Cromwell, and became a close friend of John Milton, sharing his interest in radical political and religious ideas. A distinguished member of the College of Physicians, his career was affected little if at all by the Restoration.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the monarchy}} was restored, the Interregnum ensured (along with the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the {{subsequent}} Bill of Rights 1689, and the Claim of Right Act 1689) that, unlike {{much of the rest}} of Europe, royal absolutism would not prevail, and a professed Catholic could never accede to the throne. The British constitution would develop on the basis of constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary system. With the founding of the Royal Society in 1660, science was greatly encouraged. During this period, particularly in England, the development of naval power (<b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> in voyages of discovery) led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies, particularly in North America.|$|E
