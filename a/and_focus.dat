5|$|Flotilla is a {{three-dimensional}} simultaneous turn-based strategy space combat video game {{set in a}} randomly generated galaxy. The player and computer-controlled opponents issue orders to their ships, which are carried in a simultaneous and real-time fashion {{over a period of}} 30 seconds. The game then freezes, and the player and opponents issue new orders to their ships, which are again performed for 30 seconds. This process repeats until one party is defeated. Orders are separated into three groups: attack move, flank move <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> fire. An attack move orders the ships to move and fire simultaneously; a flank move increases the ship's speed but deactivates weapons until the ship stops moving; <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> fire increases fire rate but significantly reduces the ship's speed.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} the first 15 {{years of the}} sentence, Lebrón's social worker {{told her that she}} could ask for parole, but she did not display interest in the proposal, never signing the required documentation. Due to this lack of interest, she was mandated to attend a meeting before a penitentiary committee, where she presented a written deposition expressing her position about the parole proposal as well as other subjects including terrorism, politics and the United States' use of the atomic bomb. Following this the other inmates reacted with skepticism over her intentions to refuse the offer, which made her distance herself from them <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> her attention in studying as well as writing poetry. During this timeframe, Lebrón's interest in religion grew. Lebrón's daughter Gladys died in 1977, while her mother was in prison.|$|E

The School of Medicine added a dental school in 1901 and the undergraduate School of Nursing in 1903. Georgetown Preparatory School relocated from campus in 1919 and fully separated from the university in 1927. The School of Foreign Service (SFS) was founded in 1919 by Edmund A. Walsh, to prepare students for leadership in diplomacy and foreign commerce. The School of Dentistry became independent of the School of Medicine in 1956. The School of Business was separated from the SFS in 1957. In 1998 it was renamed the McDonough School of Business in honor of alumnus Robert E. McDonough.|$|E

However, the game was criticized for its progression system and its lack of content. Initial sales were weak, but the game's player base doubled as Ubisoft subsequently released several packages of free downloadable content, developed in conjunction with Blue Byte.

However, the story and narrative became more significant in the single-player mode. Evolve does not adapt traditional storytelling methods, nor use a campaign mode, instead, players learn about the Hunters' backstory and the fictional world of Shear by slowly progressing through Evolve. Playing as different characters would also lead to different conversations and dialogues between characters.|$|E
