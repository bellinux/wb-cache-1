50|$|In 1869 {{the first}} <b>artificial</b> voice box (<b>larynx)</b> {{was built by}} Czermak.In 1873 Theodor Billroth made a total {{laryngectomy}} (in steps) and implanted an artificial voice box. A new development, using modern materials, took place in France by Debry.|$|R

5000|$|The air {{moves from}} outside the body through the tracheostoma {{directly}} to the lungs, without passing through the upper respiratory organs of the nose, mouth, and throat. Because it bypasses the vocal folds, speech can be severely impaired, {{and the development of}} an esophageal voice becomes necessary. Esophageal speech is produced without an <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx,</b> and is achieved by pumping air from the mouth into the upper esophagus. The esophagus is slightly expanded. The air is then released in a regulated manner through the mouth, with simultaneous articulation of words. Vibration of the pharyngoesophageal sphincter replaces vibration of the glottis to produce the esophageal voice.|$|E
5000|$|Fletcher's {{contributions}} {{to the theory of}} speech perception are among his best-known work. He showed that speech features are usually spread over a wide frequency range, and developed the articulation index to approximately quantify the quality of a speech channel. [...] He also developed the concepts of equal-loudness contours (commonly known as Fletcher-Munson curves), loudness scaling and summation, and the critical band. At Bell Labs, he oversaw research in electrical sound recording, including the first successful stereophonic recordings, the first live stereo sound transmission, and the production of the first vinyl recording. All of this was done {{with the help of the}} conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, Leopold Stokowski between 1931-32. Some of his other accomplishments include the production of the first functional hearing aid, the 2-A audiometer, and the <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx.</b>|$|E

He worked at Bell Laboratories for 33 years before he joined Rutgers. He has worked in voice communications, computer techniques, and electroacoustic systems. At Bell Laboratories he was the department head of the Acoustics Research Department for many years, and managed and supported work such as James E. West's invention of the electret microphone, Bishnu S. Atal's work on speech coding, David Berkley and Gary Elko's work on acoustics, Jont Allen and Joe Hall's work on psychoacoustics, James D.

5000|$|A laryngectomized {{person is}} {{required}} to breathe through a permanent breathing hole in the neck, called a tracheostoma. When a laryngectomized person occludes the tracheostoma, completely blocking exhaled air to leave the body through that pathway, exhaled air is directed through the voice prosthesis. This air enters the esophagus and escapes through the mouth. During this process, as the air passes through the upper tissues of the esophagus and lower throat, it allows for vibration of the tissues of the pharyngoesophageal segment (also called PE-segment, neoglottis or pseudoglottis). This vibration creates a sound that serves to replace the sound the vocal cords previously produced. Other methods of alaryngeal speech (speech without vocal cords) are esophageal speech, and <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx</b> speech. Studies show that tracheoesophageal speech {{is found to be}} closer to normal speech than esophageal speech and is often reported to be better, both in terms of naturalness as well as how well it is understood, when compared to esophageal speech [...] and electrolarynx speech.The first report on a tracheoesophageal puncture dates back to 1932 when a laryngectomized patient was said to use a hot ice pick to create a tracheoesophageal puncture in himself. This enabled him to speak by forcing air through the puncture when closing off the tracheostoma with a finger.|$|E
5000|$|Marwala's {{research}} interests include the theory and application of computational intelligence to engineering, computer science, finance, economics, social science and medicine. Marwala has made fundamental contributions to engineering science including {{the development of the}} concept of pseudo-modal energies, proposing the theory of rational counterfactual thinking, rational opportunity cost and the theory of flexibly bounded rationality. Marwala was a co-inventor of the innovative methods of radiation imaging [...] and with Megan Jill Russell as well as David Rubin the <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx.</b> [...] Marwala also observed that the applicability of prospect theory depends on how much artificial intelligence is used to make a decision. He also observed that the more artificial intelligence is used for decision making the more efficient the markets become. For example, if all decisions are made by artificially intelligent machines then the markets will be fully rational. [...] Marwala together with Evan Hurwitz proposed that there is less level of information asymmetry between two artificial intelligent agents than between two human agents and that the more artificial intelligence there is in the market the less is the volume of trades in the market. [...] With Evan Hurwitz, Marwala was the first researcher to build software agents that are able to bluff on playing a game of poker. Tshilidzi Marwala and Evan Hurwitz in their book [...] applied Lewis turning point theory to study the transition of the economy into automated production and identified an equilibrium point (Lewis turning point) where it does not make economic sense to move human labor to automated machines. Tshilidzi Marwala and Evan Hurwitz in their book [...] observed that the advent of intelligent online buying platforms such as Amazon and technologies such as flexible manufacturing offers the opportunity for individualized supply and demand curves to be produced. They observed that these reduce the degree of arbitrage in the market, permit for individualized pricing for the same product and brings fairness and efficiency into the market. Furthermore, with Evan Hurwitz in their book [...] they observed that decision making and predicting machines that are executed using artificial intelligence and other machine learning techniques reduce the biases and variances of the errors on decision making and thus make decisions in a closer manner to the conclusions of rational expectations theory than human decision makers.|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} the second in a three part series {{intended}} to provide information on {{the various types of}} artificial larynges and the foundation skills necessary for optimal use. There are three distinct categories of artificial larynges; the transcervical (neck-type), intra-oral, and pneumatic. The most common <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx</b> in the United States is the transcervical type. Transcervical artificial larynges are devices that conduct a battery powered, electromechanical sound from an external device through the tissues of the neck and into the oropharynx. The sound is then shaped into speech through movements of the lips, teeth, tongue and jaw. This type of <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx</b> will be discussed in the third article of this series. In the first article, the pneumatic <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx</b> was introduced. As Messing et al describe, the pneumatic <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx</b> is a unique intra-oral device in that it is the only lung powered <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx.</b> Indeed, the vast majority of intra-oral artificial larynges is not lun...|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{consequences}} of a life-saving laryngectomy are still very distressing. The Eureka project "Artificial Larynx" aims at realization of an implantable <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx</b> to eliminate all drawbacks. Methods. The <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx</b> will consist of artificial vocal folds of adjustable pitch and variable frequency during speech, an artificial epiglottis controlled by muscles, a valve mechanism to switch between breathing and speaking, and a tissue connector to connect the <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx</b> to the trachea. Results. The valve mechanism has been designed and built and it can already {{be used as a}} tracheostoma valve. For the voice-producing element we intend to use mechanical and electrical vibrating principles. Potential principles are selected and will be built as prototype. A tissue connector with a porous surface has been designed. Research will focus on optimal materials for soft tissue ingrowth. To prevent bacterial and fungal adhesion to the <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx</b> the adhesion process to silicone rubber shunt valves has been analyzed. Bacterial colonization is followed by more harmful yeast strains. The materials resistance to this adhesion process will be developed. Conclusions. Numerous problems have to be solved. Each solution. however, can be applied already to improve the existing rehabilitation process of laryngectomized patients...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} a novel <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx</b> with on/off and pitch control for Speech Production Substitutes (SPSs) users, particulary an electrolarynx control {{based on the}} myoelectric signal of the laryngeal muscles located near the body surface (such as the sternohyoideus). For patients {{who have lost their}} vocal cords or its function for vocalization, various SPSs have been {{developed a}}nd widely used. However, these substitutes have the limitation -that they cannot match with the vocalization of healthy human larynx. The measurement of the surface myoelectric potential was performed and we studied its efficiency for voice on/off and pitch frequency control. The results show that there is a quadratic relation between the measured myoelectric potential and the pitch frequency. Using this relation, it was possible to control the pitch frequency of the generated sound in three levels with 86. 7 % of accuracy (condition of linear relationship lead 68. 9 %). This confirms that the surface myoelectric potential was a suitable control signal for the <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx.</b> In this paper, the capability of novel controllable <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx</b> controlled by myoelectric signal of sternohyoideus was described...|$|E
40|$|This article {{documents}} experiments {{performed in}} ewes to design an <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx.</b> The <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx</b> {{is composed of}} a hollow, porous tube that elongates the trachea and is capped with a valve {{that acts as a}} laryngeal sphincter. Through an industrial collaboration, our team developed a porous biomaterial that can be colonized by cervical tissues. This biomaterial has been used in animals to replace part of the trachea, but it is meant to eventually substitute for laryngeal cartilage. The tracheal prosthesis is a hollow cylindrical tube composed of titanium microbeads. We performed a study in large animals to establish an optimal surgical protocol for tracheal replacement in humans. The study included 11 sheep (n = 11) and compared 5 methods of implantation. We successfully established an optimal three-step surgical protocol to make the porous-titanium tracheal prosthesis functional: (1) large lumen endoprosthetics, (2) colonization by the peripheral tissues, and (3) endoprosthetic epithelialization. This study {{is the first step in}} developing an <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx</b> because it successfully identifies a biomaterial capable of extending the trachea to allow it to open at the junction of the upper aerodigestive tracts...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} for laryngectomees {{a new kind}} of an <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx,</b> whose source noises are not {{periodic}} pulses but random noise. This idea is motivated by a mouth-resonating instrument referred to in a Chinese literature of the North Song period, Mukei Hitudan 夢渓筆談. The speech generation mechanism by this instrument is very simple. When, with the instrument applied to the mouth of the performer, the user conducts pantomimed articulations under sustained glottal stop activity, while making noises from it, the friction noises from the mouth instrument will be instantaneously and momentarily transformed into speech sounds. We designed a speaking system composed of a model larynx with a friction noise generator inside, and a VOCODER attached to it. The speech generation by a laryngectomee using this system proceeds in the following way. In the first step, the user makes friction noises from the <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx</b> being propagated in the mouth cavity, while conducting simultaneous articulations, and then out of the mouth is momentarily produced a kind of whispered speech or random noise-sourced speech. In the second step, the random noise-sourced speech is applied to the VOCODER, through which it is by now reshaped in the respects of its spectral envelope into speech sounds with voiced-voiceless distinction. The paper consists of three chapters. The first chapter is devoted to the problems inherent in three kinds of speech aid methods, Tapia’s <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx,</b> an electric buzzer, and an oesophageal phonation. The second chapter deals with interrelations between whispered speech, laryngectomee’s speech and jews-harp speech, from which is introduced the idea of a random noise-sourced <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx</b> attached to a VOCODER. The third chapter contains experimental results which are intended to exemplify its voiced-voiceless distinguishing capability...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. After total {{laryngectomy}} the normal voice {{can be replaced}} by an electronic <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx</b> (AL). However, {{the results of the}} surrogate voice are not overall satisfying due to a robotic clattered sound of that prosthesis. In this paper the outcome of a sound investigation for an AL is presented. This work is part of our AL research project on laryngectomee speech enhancement. As a result, an autoregressive model of the hearing process is derived that can directly be used for a novel speech-enhancement procedure. The model is derived in the framework of linear prediction theory {{based on the fact that}} speech can be modelled as the output of a linear filter excited by a periodic pulse train and random noise. Additionally, we developed an innovative training unit for novice laryngectomees measuring the relative inter-line energy of the speech.

40|$|Objective: To {{report on}} the career of Professor Nicolas Taptas of Constantinople (1871 - 1955) and his {{contribution}} {{to the development of}} an <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx.</b> Study Design: Historical review. Methods: The unpublished documents of Taptas's family archives and one of his papers, describing his own original technique for voice rehabilitation after total laryngectomies, were studied. Results: In his texts, Taptas described the application of external laryngeal prostheses in one of his patients who underwent total laryngectomy. Taptas meticulously recorded his own first successful attempt in a woman with cancer of the larynx. He {{was one of the first}} scientists who, at the end of the 19 th century, devised an external laryngeal prosthesis, which had the advantage of rehabilitating a sufficiently strong whispering voice; by using a prototype valve, he avoided problems of aspiration of liquids and food to the bronchi.

40|$|The <b>Artificial</b> <b>Larynx</b> Transducer (ALT) as a {{possibility}} to re-obtain audible speech for people who had to un-dergo a total laryngectomy {{has been known for}} decades. Not only the design and underlying technique but also the poor speech quality and intelligibility have not improved until now. In a world where technology rules everyday life, it is necessary to use the known technology to im-prove {{the quality of life for}} handicapped people. One reason for the lack of naturalness is the constant vibration of the ALT. A method to substantially improve ALT speech is to introduce a varying fundamental fre-quency (F 0) - contour. In this paper we present a new method to automatically learn an artificial F 0 -contour. The model used is a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) which is trained with a database containing speech of ALT users as well as healthy people. Informal listening tests suggest that this approach is a first step for a sub-sequent overall enhancement technique for speech pro-duced by an ALT.

40|$|Objective:The {{present study}} determines the {{acoustical}} and perceptual differences between alaryngeal and laryngeal speakers of Cantonese {{in the production}} of Cantonese vowels. Subjects and Methods:Formant frequencies (F 1 and F 2) associated with eight Cantonese vowels (/i, y, 3, a, q, $, œ, u/) produced by 40 alaryngeal (10 esophageal, 10 tracheoesophageal, 10 with pneumatic <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx,</b> 10 electrolaryngeal) and 10 laryngeal speakers were obtained. To assess how formants affect vowel perception, the vowels were identified by 20 naïve listeners, based on which confusion matrices were established. Results: Spectral analysis revealed that F 1 and F 2 values of Cantonese vowels produced by the alaryngeal speakers were significantly higher than those produced by laryngeal speakers, with the exception of F 2 of / 3 /, /i/ and /y/ produced by alaryngeal speakers using pneumatic <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx,</b> and / 3 / produced by electrolaryngeal speakers. Conclusion: The acoustic findings suggest a general shortening of the effective vocal tract length for resonance in alaryngeal speakers after laryngectomy. Percent correct identification of vowels from the perceptual experiment indicated similar error patterns in vowel identification between alaryngeal and laryngeal speaker groups. Among the different alaryngeal speaker groups, naïve listeners tended to perceive the vowels produced by electrolaryngeal speakers more accurately. Copyright © 2009 S.

Preoperatively, sterilization of the eyelid and conjunctival sac was performed. The surgical methods included temporal corneal incision and surgery was completed uneventfully. Eight days postoperatively, symptoms of endophthalmitis appeared; vitrectomy and IOL extraction were performed the following day but retinal function was damaged, so the best visual acuity remained 0. 01. It seemed that the most probable source of infecting bacteria came from the oral cavity. Furthermore, α-streptococcus was detected in aqueous humor, vitreous body, left eyelid skin and oral cavity.

40|$|Artificial larynxes enable {{adequate}} communication {{for people}} who are unable to use their larynxes. However, the resulting speech has an unnatural quality and is significantly less intelligible than normal speech. One of the major problems with the widely-used Transcutaneous <b>Artificial</b> <b>Larynx</b> (TAL) is the presence of a steady background noise due to the leakage of acoustic energy. In the present study, a novel adaptive filtering architecture was designed and implemented for the purpose of removing the background noise. Perceptual tests were conducted to assess speech from 2 laryngectomees and 2 normal speakers using the ServoxTAL, before and after processing by the adaptive filter.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{surgical}} removal of the larynx, the laryngec-tomee is no longer able to speak and must choose to learn a new method of oral communication if he wishes to communicate orally.

Social acceptability is one criterion which may be an important consideration. This study, therefore, compared 2 three modes of alaryngeal speech: Asai, esop~ageal, and <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx,</b> on the parameter of social acceptability.

Abnormal closure of the larynx, especially spasm, must be the cause of the ulceration. Premature babies may breathe with alveolar ducts and with alveoli {{in different parts of the}} same lung. It is suggested that hyaline membrane forms because of the abuse of normal alveolar duct function in alveolar duct type respiration. Membrane formation is a secondary phenomenon.

40|$|The loss {{of speech}} {{following}} a laryngectomy presents substantial challenges, {{and a number}} of devices have been developed to assist these patients.

40|$|Surgical voice {{restoration}} with a {{tracheo-oesophageal fistula}} using an alloplastic voice prosthesis {{is the current}} standard in Germany for patients with laryngectomy. With the increasing widespread use {{of this type of}} rehabilitation new duties emerge, not only for ones colleagues in the hospital but also for those in general practice. Care of these patients close to their home must be the aim of us all. With the use of voice prostheses on the increase any problems arising for the clinician are few and easily treatable; for these a therapy concept should be borne in mind. Surgical voice restoration is indicated only in individual cases due, among other reasons, to the high operational costs involved. If surgical voice restoration is impossible or unsuccessful, oesophageal voice replacement and electronic voice support are realistic alternatives.

40|$|According to Coleman (1971), "Differences in vocal pitch {{have been}} {{generally}} accepted as the acoustic cue that distinguishes {{between male and}} female speakers. " A speaker's fundamental frequency is the primary determinant of the perceived pitch of his or her voice. The average fundamental frequency of the female voice is 260 Hertz and the average fundamental frequency of the male voice is 130 Hertz. " [...] . a listener presumably makes a probability estimate of the speaker's sex based on the pitch of that particular voice as compared towhat he already knows about the pitch ranges of men and women. " (Coleman, 1971) These presumptions, however, have been disputed by Coleman (1971, 1973), who found that removal of laryngeal cues, i. e., pitch cues, has little effect on the identification of the speaker's sex, especially with regard to the male voice. Part I of this study will attempt to further investigate Coleman's findings by having listeners decide whether a tape recorded voice (with laryngeal cue removed) is male or female. This will be accomplished by having a group of listeners identify the sex of four speakers from a tape recording of sentences produced by male and female speakers using an <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx.</b> Studies of Peterson and Barney (1952), Lehiste and Meltzer (1973), and others, have looked at the importance of formants in identifying spoken vowels. Ingemann (1968) and Schwartz and Rine (1968) have studied the ability of listeners to distinguish voiceless fricatives auditorily and have discussed the influence {{of the size of the}} vocal tract in the identification of voiceless fricatives. Part II of this study will attempt to determine if the size of the vocal tract in front of the constriction made in the formation of vowels has an influence on the accuracy of vowel identification. More specifically, an attempt will be made to determine whether or not, with the removal of normal laryngeal cues, back vowels are easier to recognize than front vowels in isolation, and which vowels are of greatest assistance in identification of the speaker's sex. This will be accomplished by having a group of listeners identify the vowel being said and the sex of the speaker from a tape recording of isolated vowels produced by male and female speakers using an <b>artificial</b> <b>larynx.</b> Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|E
