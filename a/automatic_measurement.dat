50|$|Computerised cephalometrics is {{the process}} of {{entering}} cephalometric data in digital format into a computer for cephalometric analysis. Digitization (of radiographs) is the conversion of landmarks on a radiograph or tracing to numerical values on a two- (or three-) dimensional coordinate system, usually for the purpose of computerized cephalometric analysis. The process allows for <b>automatic</b> <b>measurement</b> of landmark relationships. Depending on the software and hardware available, the incorporation of data can be performed by digitizing points on a tracing, by scanning a tracing or a conventional radiograph, or by originally obtaining computerized radiographic images that are already in digital format, instead of conventional radiographs. Computerized cephalometrics offers the advantages of instant analysis; readily available race-, sex- and age-related norms for comparison; as well as ease of soft tissue change and surgical predictions.|$|E

5000|$|The Lown-Berkovits waveform, {{as it was}} known, was the {{standard}} for defibrillation until the late 1980s. Earlier in the 1980s, the [...] "MU lab" [...] at the University of Missouri had pioneered numerous studies introducing a new waveform called a biphasic truncated waveform (BTE). In this waveform an exponentially decaying DC voltage is reversed in polarity about halfway through the shock time, then continues to decay for some time after which the voltage is cut off, or truncated. The studies showed that the biphasic truncated waveform could be more efficacious while requiring the delivery of lower levels of energy to produce defibrillation. An added benefit was {{a significant reduction in}} weight of the machine. The BTE waveform, combined with <b>automatic</b> <b>measurement</b> of transthoracic impedance is the basis for modern defibrillators.|$|E
50|$|An {{internal}} glucose sensor, measuring at 38mm {{across and}} 16 mm thick. The implant {{consists of an}} integrated glucose sensor with signal conditioning circuits, a wireless communications circuit, and a 1-year lifetime battery, all housed in a hermetically sealed(airtight) titanium housing. The sensor is surgically implanted under the skin, at the waist or upper arm, and continuously monitors the glucose levels in the subcutaneous(under the skin) tissue. Data is then relayed to the receiver via wireless telemetry, the <b>automatic</b> <b>measurement</b> and transmission of data by wire, radio, or other means from remote sources. The ICGM system is as accurate as any other CGM device, however unlike similar products, the GlySens ICGM sensor works by detecting oxygen, allowing the system to be more stable in the interstitial fluid environment, the fluid surrounding tissue cells, than traditional CGMs. It has an outer membrane with electro-chemical detectors primed with enzymes {{to interact with the}} oxygen. The extent of the enzyme reaction and the concentration of glucose can be calculated by measuring the amount of remaining oxygen from the enzyme reaction. It is ensured the sensors are working properly through multiple built-in checks. The sensor may also have applications for glucose monitoring in type 2 diabetes including caloric and activity management, and prevention of type 2 diabetes in susceptible individuals.|$|E
5000|$|Automatic refractometers {{automatically}} {{measure the}} refractive index of a sample. The <b>automatic</b> <b>measurement</b> of the refractive {{index of the}} sample {{is based on the}} determination of the critical angle of total reflection.A light source, usually a long-life LED, is focused onto a prism surface via a lens system. An interference filter guarantees the specified wavelength. Due to focusing light to a spot at the prism surface, a wide range of different angles is covered.As shown in the figure [...] "Schematic setup of an automatic refractometer" [...] the measured sample is in direct contact with the measuring prism. Depending on its refractive index, the incoming light below the critical angle of total reflection is partly transmitted into the sample, whereas for higher angles of incidence the light is totally reflected. This dependence of the reflected light intensity from the incident angle is measured with a high-resolution sensor array. From the video signal taken with the CCD sensor the refractive index of the sample can be calculated.This method of detecting the angle of total reflection is independent on the sample properties. It is even possible to measure the refractive index of optically dense strongly absorbing samples or samples containing air bubbles or solid particles [...] Furthermore, only a few microliters are required and the sample can be recovered. This determination of the refraction angle is independent of vibrations and other environmental disturbances.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the noninvasive quantification of coronary artery stenosis using cardiac software packages and vessel phantoms with known stenosis severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four different sizes of vessel phantoms were filled with contrast agent and scanned on a 64 -slice multidetector computed tomography. Diameter and area stenosis were evaluated by 2 observers blinded from the true measures using 5 different software packages. Measurements were compared with the true measure of the vessel phantoms. The absolute difference in stenosis measurements and intraobserver and interobserver variabilities were assessed. RESULTS: All software packages show a trend toward larger differences for the smaller vessel phantoms. The absolute difference of the <b>automatic</b> <b>measurements</b> was significantly higher compared with that of the manual measurements in all 5 evaluated software packages for all vessel phantoms (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Manual stenosis measurements are significantly more accurate compared with <b>automatic</b> <b>measurements,</b> and therefore, manual adjustments are still essential for noninvasive assessment of coronary artery stenosi...|$|R
