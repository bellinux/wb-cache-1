5|$|Attachment {{disorder}} {{is a broad}} term intended to describe disorders of mood, behavior, and social relationships arising from a failure to form normal attachments to primary care giving figures in early childhood. Such a failure would result from unusual early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt separation from caregivers between 6 months and three years of age, frequent change or excessive numbers of caregivers, or lack of caregiver responsiveness to child communicative efforts resulting in a lack of basic trust. <b>A</b> <b>problematic</b> history of social relationships occurring after about age three may be distressing to a child, but does not result in attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|Dejection was a {{response}} to Wordsworth's Immortality Ode. It conveys feelings of dejection, expressed through an inability to write or appreciate nature. Wordsworth is introduced in the poem as a counterbalance to Coleridge; Wordsworth is able to turn his darkness to benefit and accept comfort. However, Coleridge cannot find any positive aspect to his despair, and is paralyzed by his emotions. The poem captures many of the feelings expressed in his earlier works, including his exploration of <b>a</b> <b>problematic</b> childhood and thoughts on his religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Josce's {{grandson}} Fulk fitzWarin, {{who died}} in 1258, is ostensibly the hero of a lost romantic poem called Fouke le Fitz Waryn. The work survives as French prose in a loose corpus of medieval literature known as the Matter of England. However, it appears to confuse events of Fulk fitzWarin's lifetime with those of his grandfather's. Other errors in the work include transposing some of the Welsh Marcher barons of King Henry I of England's reign into nobles of William the Conqueror's time, and omitting {{an entire generation of}} fitzWarins. Although scholars believe Fouke le Fitz Waryn draws on genuine tradition, the difficulty in separating the fitzWarin biographies makes it <b>a</b> <b>problematic</b> source.|$|E

5|$|The Rhodes Mk III EK-10 was a {{combination}} electric piano and synthesizer instrument, introduced in 1980 before CBS bought ARP Instruments in 1981. It used analog oscillators and filters alongside the existing electromechanical elements. The overall effect {{was that of a}} Rhodes piano and a synthesizer being played simultaneously. The instrument was unreliable with <b>a</b> <b>problematic</b> production, particularly when a shipment of 150 units to Japan caused interference with local television reception. Compared to the new polyphonic synthesizers being marketed at the same time, it was limited in scope and sound, and very few units were sold.|$|E
5|$|The crew of EO-19 {{conducted}} {{their first}} Extra-vehicular activity, or spacewalk, on July 14.

They then proceeded to inspect a docking mechanism in preparation for the relocation of the Kristall module. The final task of the spacewalk was to inspect a solar array on Kristall that was not tracking the Sun properly. The excursion ended after five hours and thirty-four minutes outside the station.|$|E

5|$|A pair of aces {{gives the}} {{blackjack}} player a starting hand value of either a 2 or a soft 12 which is <b>a</b> <b>problematic</b> starting hand in either case. Splitting aces gives a player two chances to hit 21. Splitting aces is so {{favorable to the}} player that most gambling establishments have rules limiting the player's rights to do so. In most casinos the player is only allowed to draw one card on each split ace. As a general rule, a ten on a split ace (or vice versa) is not considered a natural blackjack and does not get any bonus. Prohibiting resplitting and redoubling is also common. Regardless of the payout for blackjack, the rules for resplitting, the rules for doubling, the rules for multiple card draws and the dealer's cards, one should always split aces.|$|E
5|$|According to Cooney and O'Dell, the 1980s were <b>a</b> <b>problematic</b> {{period for}} the Workshop. Other than Sesame Street, many of its {{productions}} were not successful. 3-2-1 Contact premiered during 1980, and were broadcast in various forms until 1988. The CTW found that finding funding for this series and other science-oriented series like Square One Television, which was broadcast from 1987 to 1992, was easy because the National Science Foundation and other foundations were interested in funding science education. A series of poor investments in video games, motion picture production, theme parks, and other business ventures hurt the organization financially. Cooney brought in Bill Whaley during the late 1970s {{to work on their}} licensing agreements, but he was unable to compensate for the CTW's losses until 1986, when licensing revenues stabilized and its portfolio investments increased.|$|E

5|$|Bruce Bowen Jr. {{was born}} in Merced, California as son of Bruce Bowen Sr. and Dietra Campbell. Bowen had <b>a</b> <b>problematic</b> {{childhood}} growing up in Merced, because, he claims, his mother took drugs and even sold the family TV to feed her habit. Bruce Jr. spent his days playing basketball and eventually became {{a star in the}} local West Fresno Edison High School squad. He then played four seasons at Cal State Fullerton, appearing in 101 games, and averaged 11.4 points and 5.8 rebounds per game. After averaging 16.3 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 36.6 minutes in 27 games as a senior in 1992–93, he was named to the All-Big West Conference First Team. Bowen ranks 12th on the Titans' all-time list in career points (1,155) and is seventh all-time in rebounds (559).|$|E
5|$|Henry had <b>a</b> <b>problematic</b> {{relationship}} with Louis VII of France throughout the 1150s. The {{two men had}} already clashed over Henry's succession to Normandy and the remarriage of Eleanor, and the relationship was not repaired. Louis invariably attempted to take {{the moral high ground}} in respect to Henry, capitalising on his reputation as a crusader and circulating rumours about his rival's behaviour and character. Henry had greater resources than Louis, however, particularly after taking England, and Louis was far less dynamic in resisting Angevin power than he had been earlier in his reign. The disputes between the two drew in other powers across the region, including Thierry, the Count of Flanders, who signed a military alliance with Henry, albeit with a clause that prevented the count from being forced to fight against Louis, his feudal lord. Further south, Theobald V, the Count of Blois, an enemy of Louis, became another early ally of Henry. The resulting military tensions and the frequent face-to-face meetings to attempt to resolve them has led historian Jean Dunbabin to liken the situation to the period of the Cold War in Europe in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, the LISPC {{approved}} $37,000 (1947USD) {{to construct}} a stone ornate gasoline station along the Meadowbrook in Jones Beach State Park. The gas station, one of eight constructed by Robert Moses throughout Long Island, would serve drivers, when there were fewer stations throughout the area. After 1975, NYSDOT, who {{took control of the}} parkways from the LISPC, started demolishing some of the stations, including the Meadowbrook, which ended up being one of the first buildings to go. The stations, which were once useful, would fork from the left lane into the median. However, according to NYSDOT, with the change in traffic patterns, the entrances to these stations became dangerous. By 1997, over two decades after demolition, the station site became <b>a</b> <b>problematic</b> place for people parking and walking up the Meadowbrook and Loop to fish on the bridges. According to the New York State Police, the site is legal for use as a repair stop or for emergencies. However, not for use of dropping people off for fishing, which is also illegal to fish from atop the bridge, except it is around and under the bridges.|$|E

5|$|Offa's Dyke, most {{of which}} was {{probably}} built in his reign, is a testimony to the extensive resources Offa had at his command {{and his ability to}} organise them. Other surviving sources include <b>a</b> <b>problematic</b> document known as the Tribal Hidage, which may provide further evidence of Offa's scope as a ruler, though its attribution to his reign is disputed. A significant corpus of letters dates from the period, especially from Alcuin, an English deacon and scholar who spent over a decade at Charlemagne's court as one of his chief advisors, and corresponded with kings, nobles and ecclesiastics throughout England. These letters in particular reveal Offa's relations with the continent, as does his coinage, which was based on Carolingian examples.|$|E
5|$|Slade's Case (or Slade v. Morley) {{was a case}} in English {{contract}} law that ran from 1596 to 1602. Under the medieval common law, claims seeking the repayment of a debt or other matters could only be pursued through a writ of debt in the Court of Common Pleas, <b>a</b> <b>problematic</b> and archaic process. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded in creating another method, enforced by the Court of King's Bench, through the action of assumpsit, which was technically for deceit. The legal fiction used was that by failing to pay after promising to do so, a defendant had committed deceit, and was liable to the plaintiff. The conservative Common Pleas, through the appellate court the Court of Exchequer Chamber, began to overrule decisions made by the King's Bench on assumpsit, causing friction between the courts.|$|E
5|$|Sociologist Reiner Grundmann's {{review in}} BioSocieties journal, {{acknowledges}} that the book is well researched and factually based, but criticizes the book as being written in {{a black and white}} manner whereas historians should write a more nuanced description. The book depicts special interests and contrarians misleading the public as being mainly responsible for stopping action on policy. He says this shows a lack of basic understanding of the political process and the mechanisms of knowledge policy, because the authors assume that public policy would follow on from an understanding of the science. While the book provides all the (formal) hallmarks of science, Grundmann sees it less as a scholarly work than a passionate attack and overall as <b>a</b> <b>problematic</b> book.|$|E
