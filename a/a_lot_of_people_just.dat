So, a friend of mine was there, and I was like, 'Let's walk together.'" [...] After reports continued to speculate regarding the video's subject, Ratner explained that the main inspiration behind the video was the 1983 film, The King of Comedy.

[...] An unnamed observer told Gaines: [...] "... knowing that everyone in that group was married, and had children and a house. I think he [...] felt like more of a benefactor than an artist." [...] Music writer Richard Goldstein relates his impression of Wilson based on a meeting in 1967: [...] "He came across as ... deeply insecure about his creative instincts, terrified that the songs he was working on were too arty to sell."

500|$|After {{months of}} {{recording}} and media hype, the original Smile project was shelved due to corporate pressures, technical problems, internal power struggles, and legal stalling. Business partner David Anderle attempted to form Brother Records, an independent label, {{with the intention}} of giving [...] "entirely new concepts to the recording industry, and to give the Beach Boys total creative and promotional control over their product." [...] A March 1967 lawsuit seeking $255,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) was launched against Capitol Records over neglected royalty payments. Within the lawsuit, there was also an attempt to terminate the band's contract with Capitol before its November 1969 expiry. Band quarrels led Parks to leave the project in April 1967, with Anderle following suit weeks later. Dennis Wilson explained that the group had become [...] "very paranoid about the possibility of losing our public.... Drugs played a great role in our evolution but as a result we were frightened that people would no longer understand us, musically."

5000|$|He further {{describes}} {{the concept of}} [...] "third nature" [...] or telesthesia, where devices such as television and the telephone creates a platform which we use to communicate to people over large distances {{and not just a}} machine that we learn to operate individually.

It's no longer a case of making second nature out of nature, of building things and getting used to living in the world people build.
