25|$|After his {{ordination}} in Rome in 1910, Coady {{began teaching}} at St. FX. He put on special classes {{for students at}} risk of failing, and prided himself on being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> maths to anyone. He honed his considerable oratorical skills and developed a talent for making complex concepts easily understood.|$|E
25|$|While in Ireland, Arne {{began to}} pursue alchemy {{once more and}} he took a house at Clontarf in the hopes of {{discovering}} the philosopher's stone. His pursuits again led him into debt and he was arrested and confined to a Dublin sponging-house. While there he was assisted by the father of Michael Kelly, later a famous tenor, who provided him with a piano in return for young Kelly’s daily lesson. In this way Arne was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> students and thereby earn money to pay off his creditors.|$|E
25|$|In 2016 an {{interview}} within the book De dybeste rødder (en: The Deepest Roots) she showed, according to historians at Saxo instituttet, {{a change in}} attitude to immigration towards a more restrictive stance. She stated that the Danish people should have more explicitly clarified the rules and values of Danish culture {{in order to be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> them to new arrivals. Further stated that the Danes in general have underestimated the difficulties involved in successful integration of immigrants, exemplified with the rules of a democracy not being clarified to Muslim immigrants and a lack of readiness to enforce those rules. This was received as a change in line with the attitude of the Danish people.|$|E

25|$|Voltaire's {{father died}} when he was four months old. At ten months old, Voltaire emigrated to New Jersey with his mother and sister and his mother remarried. However, he states that he did not enjoy {{residing}} there, stating he was a victim of bullying because of his heritage and strange hobbies and interests. At the age of ten, Voltaire was inspired by the films of Ray Harryhausen (Jason and the Argonauts, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad), and began animating on a super 8 camera. By piecing together snippets of information from fanzines, he eventually was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> himself how to make foam rubber animation models and animate them. At the age of 17, he moved to New York City and got his first job as an animator with Parker Brothers. Voltaire says that he loves New York, and that the only other place he would be happy living is Tokyo.|$|E
25|$|Robert Hooke {{was born}} in 1635 in Freshwater on the Isle of Wight to John Hooke and Cecily Gyles. Robert {{was the last of}} four children, two boys and two girls, and there was an age {{difference}} of seven years between him and the next youngest. Their father John was a Church of England priest, the curate of Freshwater's Church of All Saints, and his two brothers (Robert's uncles) were also ministers. Robert Hooke was expected to succeed in his education and join the Church. John Hooke also was in charge of a local school, and so was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> Robert, at least partly at home perhaps due to the boy's frail health. He was a Royalist and almost certainly a member of a group who went to pay their respects to Charles I when he escaped to the Isle of Wight. Robert, too, grew up to be a staunch monarchist.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Mary's {{failure to}} learn exactly what seeing red feels like {{is simply a}} failure of language, or a failure {{of our ability to}} {{describe}} experiences. An alien race with a different method of communication or description might be perfectly <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> their version of Mary exactly how seeing the color red would feel. Perhaps it is simply a uniquely human failing to communicate first-person experiences from a third-person perspective. Dennett suggests that the description might even be possible using English. He uses a simpler version of the Mary thought experiment to show how this might work. What if Mary was in a room without triangles and was prevented from seeing or making any triangles? An English-language description of just a few words would be sufficient for her to imagine {{what it is like to}} see a triangle—she can simply and directly visualize a triangle in her mind. Similarly, Dennett proposes, it is perfectly, logically possible that the quale of what it is like to see red could eventually be described in an English-language description of millions or billions of words.|$|E

25|$|The {{school he}} founded was called Saivaprakasa Vidyasala or School of Lord Siva's splendor. The school {{did not follow}} the {{traditional}} Tamil teaching system, in which each student worked on his own pace and the teacher pupil ratio was extremely low. Although this system produced stellar experts in subject matter but took too much labour and was inefficient compared to the western system used by the Missionaries. He developed his teaching methods based on the exposure he had with the Missionaries. He developed the curriculum to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> 20 students {{at a time and}} included secular subject matters and English. He also wrote the basic instruction materials for different grades in Saivism. Most of his teachers were friends and acquaintances who were volunteers. This school system was duplicated later in Chidambaram in India in 1865 and it still exits. But the school system he founded in Sri Lanka was replicated and over 100 primary and secondary schools were built based on his teaching methods. This school system produced numerous students who had clearer understanding of their religion, rituals and theology and still able to function in a western oriented world.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his other teachings, he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> a psychological test and measurement course. Because he loved the mathematical portion of the course, he changed the class to aptitude testing, which focused on scientific basis of vocational guidance. On the side, Hull also conducted research to build a machine that could perform all the correlational work for him automatically. After teaching the aptitude testing class, Clark went on to teaching an introductory class for premedical students. While teaching this class he particularly took notice of suggestion and hypnosis. This was {{the starting point of}} his experimental testing in this field in which Clark focused on the quantitative methodology in experimental psychology. After ten years of in-depth research, he wrote the book Hypnosis and Suggestibility in 1933. After writing the book, he decided to continue in experimental field by teaching this course in {{addition to}} the premedical course. Clark had a great desire to teach this course and felt as though this specific type of science was the foundation of true psychology. In 1929 he was called to the Institute of Psychology at Yale University as a research professor of psychology where he worked on the problems concerning systematic behavior theory. In 1930, he came to several conclusions about psychology: the first was that he believed that psychology is a true natural science. The second was that its primary laws are expressed quantitatively by moderate number equations and that all complex behavior or single individuals will be derived as second laws. The third was that the primary laws with the behavior (based on the condition) can also be derived as quantitative laws from the same primary equation. he and other psychologists (Neal E. Miller, John Dollard, and O.H Mower) looked into these ideas more, they sought to understand what underlined conditioned reflex and behavior while also seeking to understand Freud and others like him. This eventually led to his work that he is primarily known for: Principles of Behavior.|$|E
25|$|During {{many years}} (at least {{during most of}} the 20th century to the 2000s), a {{graduate}} in Portugal used to have a compulsory 4 to 5-year course (an exception included medicine, with a 6 years course) known as licenciatura which was granted exclusively by universities. Only graduates having the licenciatura diploma exclusively conferred by the universities were fully able to develop professional activity in their respective field (like engineering, or secondary school teaching) and were universally recognized and regulated by its Ordem (the highest professional association authority) and/or the State. Other higher education courses offering a 3-year bacharelato degree that the newly created polytechnic institutes started to award in the 1970s and 1980s, like the technical engineering courses, the accounting technician courses, or the basic education teaching courses, had its own regulation scheme and were not recognized by the respective Ordens Profissionais in the field or by the State to perform the same professional activities university's licenciados were habilitated for (for instance, technical engineers did not belong to the Ordem of engineers and were awarded a limited range of engineering projects, and most teachers with the polytechnic degrees were not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> school students after the 6th grade). In 1999, over 15,000 students enrolled in Portuguese higher learning institutions and newly graduates in the fields of engineering and architecture, were enrolled or were awarded a degree in a non-accredited course. Those students and graduates with no official recognition were not admitted to any Ordem and were unable to sign projects in their presumed field of expertise. At the same time, only one accredited engineering course was offered by a private university, and over 90% of the accredited courses with recognition in the fields of engineering, architecture, and law were provided by state-run universities. The Agência de Avaliação e Acreditação do Ensino Superior (A3ES) (Higher Education Accreditation and Evaluation Agency) was created in the late 2000s and started to work in the early 2010s. In 2012, its first thorough accreditation and evaluation report to date concluded that 25% (or 107) of 420 (out of 3500) bachelor's, master's and doctorate degree programs offered in Portugal, did not comply with elemental quality and academic integrity standards and should be terminated. In the 1990s, the offer of many new degrees in Portugal became widespread across the entire country through both public and private university and polytechnic institutions. By 2010, lower selectiviness and academic integrity levels, including in some schools previously known for its reputation and prestige, debased the average teaching level in Portugal according {{to the head of the}} Portuguese Bar Association (Ordem dos Advogados) Marinho Pinto.|$|E

500|$|The [...] {{was created}} by Kakashi Hatake during his childhood, gaining its name when the {{channeling}} of strong lightning-based chakra in one's hand produces a sound reminiscent of chirping birds. Once enough lightning-chakra has been collected, the user rushes at their target and thrusts the Chidori into it; {{the speed of the}} attack and the amount of chakra used enable the user to penetrate most defenses easily. During Kakashi Gaiden, a short flashback to Kakashi's childhood that divides Part I and II of the series, the Chidori is revealed to cause a tunnel vision effect because of the speeds at which the user moves, leaving them vulnerable to a counterattack. Due to this disability, only ninja with a Sharingan eye can use the Chidori safely, as the Sharingan's ability to notice even the slightest details counteracts the tunnel vision. As a result, Kakashi is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> the Chidori to Sasuke Uchiha during Part I.|$|E

500|$|Once Vermigli {{arrived in}} Zürich he was {{questioned}} regarding his theological views by several Protestant leaders including Heinrich Bullinger, Konrad Pellikan, and Rudolph Gualther. They eventually determined {{that he could}} be allowed to teach Protestant theology, but there was no position vacant for him to fill there or in Basel, where he went next. In a letter to his former congregation in Lucca, he explained his motives for leaving and also expressed discouragement at not being able to find a post. Basler humanist [...] assisted him with money, and reformer Oswald Myconius recommended him to Martin Bucer in Strasbourg, with whose writings Vermigli was already familiar. Vermigli moved to Strasbourg and became a close personal friend and ally of Bucer, who granted him the chair of Old Testament at the Senior School, succeeding Wolfgang Capito. He began by lecturing on the minor prophets, followed by Lamentations, Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus. Vermigli was delighted to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> from the original-language text of the Old Testament, as many of his students could read Hebrew. He was well-liked by his students and fellow scholars. Vermigli was known for precision, simplicity, and clarity of speech in contrast to Bucer's propensity for digressions which sometimes left his students lost.|$|E
500|$|At Brook Farm, {{women had}} the {{opportunity}} to expand beyond their typical sphere of tasks and their labor was highly valued. They did have tasks that were typical of other women at the time such as simple food preparation, and shared housekeeping. However, during the harvest time women were allowed to work in the fields and men even helped out with laundry during the cold weather. Because no single religion could impose its beliefs on the community, women were safe from the typical patriarchy associated with religion at the time. Because of the community's focus on individual freedom, women were autonomous from their husbands and were also allowed to become stockholders. Women also {{played an important role in}} providing sources of income to the community. Many devoted time to making, as Brook Farmer Marianne Dwight described, [...] "elegant and tasteful caps, capes, collars, undersleeves, etc., etc.," [...] for sale at shops in Boston.

40|$|Generally speaking, the {{following}} conclusions could be made: Further enhancement {{of work with}} students is necessary, <b>to</b> render students <b>able</b> <b>to</b> perform <b>teaching</b> in physical education.

It is necessary to create possibilities for more student interaction with the pupils in schools, so that upon completion of studies they are ready to work in primary and secondary schools. Special attention needs to be paid to preparation of lower-grade teachers 1 to perform physical education, bearing in mind the expected education reform process.

This creature is concealed outside the pleroma; in isolation, and thinking itself alone, it creates materiality and a host of co-actors, referred to as archons. The demiurge is responsible for the creation of mankind; trapping elements of the pleroma stolen from Sophia inside human bodies.
