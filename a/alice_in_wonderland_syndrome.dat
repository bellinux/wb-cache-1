25|$|It is {{believed}} Kollwitz suffered anxiety during her childhood {{due to the}} death of her siblings, including the early death of her younger brother, Benjamin.

25|$|<b>Alice</b> <b>in</b> <b>Wonderland</b> <b>Syndrome,</b> a {{neurological}} condition associated with both micropsia and macropsia, {{is named after}} Lewis Carroll's famous 19th century novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. In the story, the title character, Alice, experiences numerous situations {{similar to those of}} micropsia and macropsia. Speculation has arisen that Carroll may have written the story using his own direct experience with episodes of micropsia resulting from the numerous migraines he was known to suffer from. It has also been suggested that Carroll may have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E

2500|$|Patients {{with both}} Epstein-Barr virus and {{infectious}} mononucleosis have cited {{an increase in}} the sizes of perceived objects, coinciding with other symptoms of <b>Alice</b> <b>in</b> <b>Wonderland</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> Additionally, it has been observed that Epstein-Barr patients who cite hallucinations display abnormal MRI scans. The MRI may show swelling of the cerebral cortex, transient T2 prolongation, and transient lesions. [...] Unlike in MRI's, no abnormalities have been reported in CT scans. It is thus recommended that an Epstein-Barr patient who cites visual hallucinations have an MRI scan. Macropsia may appear either before the onset, or after the resolution, of all clinical symptoms associated with the illness. The duration of the disturbances have been shown to range between two weeks and seven months. Almost all patients with macropsia due to infectious mononucleiosis make full recoveries. [...] Patients with Coxsackievirus B1 have reported numerous symptoms of <b>Alice</b> <b>in</b> <b>Wonderland</b> <b>Syndrome,</b> the most common of which being macropsia and micropsia.|$|E
2500|$|Macropsia (also {{known as}} megalopia) is a {{neurological}} condition affecting human visual perception, in which objects within an affected {{section of the}} visual field appear larger than normal, causing the person to feel smaller than they actually are. [...] Macropsia, along with its opposite condition, micropsia, can be categorized under dysmetropsia. [...] Macropsia is related to other conditions dealing with visual perception, such as aniseikonia and <b>Alice</b> <b>in</b> <b>Wonderland</b> <b>Syndrome</b> (AIWS, also known as Todd’s syndrome). [...] Macropsia has {{a wide range of}} causes, from prescription and illicit drugs, to migraines and (rarely) complex partial epilepsy, and to different retinal conditions, such as epiretinal membrane. Physiologically, retinal macropsia results from the compression of cones in the eye. [...] It is the compression of receptor distribution that results in greater stimulation and thus a larger perceived image of an object.|$|E
2500|$|There are a {{broad range}} of {{psychological}} and emotional effects that a person suffering macropsia may experience. One competing theory has radically stated that macropsia may be an entirely psychological pathological phenomenon without any structural defect or definite cause. He or she may be in an irritable or angry state, or in contrast, a euphoric state. There is evidence that those who experience <b>Alice</b> <b>in</b> <b>Wonderland</b> <b>Syndrome</b> and associated macropsia are able to recount their experiences with thorough detail. There may be no evidence of psychiatric disturbance and, as a result, no psychiatric therapy may be required. Psychological conditions often arise from macropsia, but the general consensus is that they do not cause macropsia. Those afflicted may experience extreme anxiety both during and after episodes {{as a result of the}} overwhelming nature of his or her distorted visual field. Due to the fear and anxiety associated with the condition, those who have previously suffered an episode hesitate to recount the episode, although retain the ability to do so. Psychologically, a person with macropsia may feel separation and dissociation from the outside world and even from immediate family. This feeling of dissociation has mostly been noted in child or adolescent patients. [...] The patient may feel that he or she must unfairly contend with hostile and aggressive forces due to the gigantic nature of the surrounding environment. The defense against said forces is usually expressed verbally. The patient may falsely present an outgoing or flamboyant persona, while remaining fearful of people internally. He or she, in an attempt to balance the size distortion, may try to make others feel small in size through insult or hostile behavior. The psychological impact of macropsia on long time sufferers who have had the condition since childhood may be greater and lead to severe ego-deficiencies. An alternate interpretation of the condition is that macropsia is a response to biophysiological contraction and has no psychological roots. Thus, when a patient reaches for an enlarged object, he or she is overcoming that physiological contraction [...] However, this theory has been under much scrutiny.|$|E
