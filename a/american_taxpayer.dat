25|$|What changes, if any, {{should be}} made to tax and {{transfer}} payment policies to address growing income inequality? The <b>American</b> <b>Taxpayer</b> Relief Act of 2012 raised taxes on the higher-income taxpayers, increasing their effective tax rates. However, as of 2014 the U.S. was 30th percentile globally on income inequality and ranked last (most unequal) among the developed (OECD) countries.|$|E

25|$|The {{national}} debt increased from $10.0 trillion in September 2008 to $19.6 trillion in September 2016. As described above, roughly $3 trillion of this increase was anticipated in the January 2009 CBO baseline forecast, or $6-8 trillion adjusting for {{the extension of}} the Bush tax cuts and other baseline overrides typically legislated. Obama ultimately extended the Bush tax cuts for approximately 98% of taxpayers as part of the <b>American</b> <b>Taxpayer</b> Relief Act of 2012, allowing taxes to rise on the top 1–2% of income earners. The debt held by the public (which excludes intra-governmental liabilities like the Social Security Trust Fund) rose from around 36% GDP in 2009 to 76% GDP in 2016, the highest level except for the post World War 2 era.|$|E
25|$|President Obama pledged {{before he}} was elected not to raise taxes except on those couples earning over $250,000 (200,000 for individuals). With the Bush tax cuts {{extension}} scheduled to expire in January 2013, President Obama had significant leverage with the Republican Congress, as his veto of further extensions {{would have resulted in}} a sizable income tax increase across the income spectrum, a significant expansion of government, but contrary to his pledge. His compromise, the <b>American</b> <b>Taxpayer</b> Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), passed by a wide majority in the Senate, with both Democrats and Republicans supporting it, while a majority of Republicans in the House opposed it. It extended the Bush tax cuts for roughly the bottom 99% of income earners (those earning below $400,000, or $450,000 for married couples).|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Obama's 2012 re-election, Congressional Republicans and Obama again faced {{off over}} the final fate of the Bush tax cuts. Republicans sought to make all tax cuts permanent, while Obama sought to extend the tax cuts only for those making under $250,000. Obama and Congressional Republicans came to an {{agreement}} on the <b>American</b> <b>Taxpayer</b> Relief Act of 2012, which made permanent the tax cuts for individuals making less than $400,000 a year (or less than $450,000 for couples). For earnings greater than that amount, the income tax increased from 35% to 39.6%, which was the top rate before {{the passage of the}} Bush tax cuts. The deal also permanently indexed the alternative minimum tax for inflation, limited deductions for individuals making more than $250,000 ($300,000 for couples), permanently set the estate tax exemption at $5.12 million (indexed to inflation), and increased the top estate tax rate from 35% to 40%. Though many Republicans did not like the deal, the bill passed the Republican House in large part {{due to the fact that}} the failure to pass any bill would have resulted in the total expiration of the Bush tax cuts.|$|E

25|$|The federal {{personal}} income tax is progressive, meaning a higher marginal tax rate is applied to higher ranges of income. For example, in 2010 the tax rate that applied to the first $17,000 in taxable income for a couple filing jointly was 10%, while the rate applied to income over $379,150 was 35%. The top marginal tax rate has declined considerably since 1980. For example, the top tax rate was lowered from 70% to 50% in 1980 and reached as low as 28% in 1988. The Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, extended by President Obama in 2010, lowered the top rate from 39.6% to 35%. The <b>American</b> <b>Taxpayer</b> Relief Act of 2012 raised the income tax rates for individuals earning over $400,000 and couples over $450,000. There are numerous exemptions and deductions, that typically result {{in a range of}} 35–40% of U.S. households owing no federal income tax. The recession and tax cut stimulus measures increased this to 51% for 2009, versus 38% in 2007. In 2011 it was found that 46% of households paid no federal income tax, however the top 1% contributed about 25% of total taxes collected. In 2014, the top 1% paid approximately 46% of the federal income taxes, excluding payroll taxes.|$|E

500|$|During {{his first}} two years in office, Obama signed many {{landmark}} bills. Main reforms were the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (often referred to as [...] "Obamacare", shortened as the [...] "Affordable Care Act", or abbreviated as the ACA), the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the Great Recession, but the GOP regained control of the House of Representatives in 2011. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control and the <b>American</b> <b>Taxpayer</b> Relief Acts. In foreign policy, Obama increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. He ordered military involvement in Libya in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi, and the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.|$|E

In 2011, he opposed going ahead with the military mission {{that resulted in the}} death of Osama bin Laden. Obama and Biden were re-elected in 2012. In October 2015, after months of speculation, Biden chose not to run for President of the United States in 2016. In December 2016, he refused to rule out a potential bid for President in 2020, but announced on January 13, 2017, that he would not run, only to seemingly backtrack just four days later, again refusing to rule out a potential bid. On January 12, 2017, Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, with distinction.
