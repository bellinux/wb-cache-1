5|$|Sometime {{prior to}} 1762, Scott's older brother, John, died, leaving Scott to inherit his father's land near the James River <b>and</b> <b>Muddy</b> Creek. Having left the army, he had settled on his {{inherited}} farm by late 1761. On February 25, 1762, he married Frances Sweeney from Cumberland County, Virginia. With {{the help of}} approximately 10 slaves, Scott engaged in growing tobacco and milling flour on his farm. In July 1766, he was named one of two captains in the local militia. Over the next several years, Scott {{and his wife had}} four boys and four or five girls.|$|E
5|$|After Bab el Wad, {{the road}} wound to Jerusalem through deep, narrow valleys, over steep spurs, {{and around the}} {{shoulders}} of rocky hills. There were other ways through the hills, but they were a tangle of unmapped, rough and rocky hill tracks and pathways—often little more than donkey tracks—which made movement by infantry, dismounted cavalry, and artillery very difficult. The rough tracks meandered through narrow valleys and over distorted piles of razor-backed ridges, which were broken by groups of cone-shaped hills and successive shelves of rock jutting out from every hillside at intervals of a few yards. It was virtually impossible for advances to the north or south of the main road to be supported by artillery. In heavy rain and cold, wet <b>and</b> <b>muddy</b> conditions, it {{was found to be}} impossible to deploy the 75th Division's guns off the road. These guns had been brought forward by teams of up to eight horses to a gun the day before.|$|E
5|$|During its peak, up to 300 people {{visited the}} hot spring daily. On 1 March 2002, {{it was closed}} for two months while {{upgrading}} and improvement works were carried out to {{the area around the}} spring, which had become sodden <b>and</b> <b>muddy.</b> Litter had also become a problem because of the increased numbers of visitors. The former dirt track leading to the spring was paved with cement, and lined with bougainvillea bushes and high fences to ensure the security of the air base. Drainage pipes were also installed. Mindef, which owns the land, allows public access between 7 am and 7 pm daily, free-of-charge. When the spring reopened on 1 May 2002, more than 100 people visited the site despite the afternoon drizzle. At the same time, some new free-hold condominiums were built in the surrounding area; one of the developments, built by the property arm of F in 2001, is called Seletaris after the company's former mineral water.|$|E

5|$|In 1129, Emperor Gaozong {{designated}} the site at Hangzhou (known then as Lin'an) {{to be the}} temporary settlement of the court, {{but it was not}} until 1132 that it was declared the new Song capital. Hangzhou and Nanjing were devastated by the Jin raids; both cities were heavily repopulated with northern refugees who outnumbered the remaining original inhabitants. Hangzhou was chosen not only for its natural scenic beauty, but for the surrounding topographic barriers of lakes <b>and</b> <b>muddy</b> rice-fields that gave it defensive potential against northern armies comprising mostly cavalry. Yet it was viewed by the court as only a temporary capital while the Song emperors planned to retake Kaifeng. However, the rapid growth of the city from the 12th century to the 13th necessitated long-term goals of residency. In 1133 the modest palatial residence of the imperial family was improved upon from a simple provincial lodging to one that at least accommodated strolls with new covered alleyways to deflect the rain. In 1148 the walls of the small palace compound were finally extended to the southeast, yet this was another marginal improvement.|$|E
5|$|Keith Richards and Mick Jagger became {{childhood}} {{friends and}} classmates in 1950 in Dartford, Kent, before the Jagger {{family moved to}} Wilmington, five miles (8.05km) away, in 1954. In the mid-1950s, Jagger formed a garage band with his friend Dick Taylor; the group mainly played material by Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Howlin' Wolf and Bo Diddley. Jagger met Richards again in 1960 on Dartford railway station, and the Chuck Berry <b>and</b> <b>Muddy</b> Waters records that Jagger was carrying revealed a common interest. A musical partnership began shortly afterwards. Richards joined Jagger and Taylor at frequent meetings at Jagger's house. The meetings switched to Taylor's house in late 1961, where the three were joined by Alan Etherington and Bob Beckwith; the quintet called themselves the Blues Boys.|$|E
5|$|Mangrove trees {{cover the}} coastlines of South Florida, {{sometimes}} growing inland {{depending on the}} amount of salt water present within the Everglades ecosystems. During drier years when less fresh water flows to the coast, mangroves will appear among fresh water plants. When rain is abundant, sawgrass and other fresh water plants may be found closer to the coast. Three species of mangrove trees—red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa)—can be found in the Everglades. Due to their high tolerance of salt water, winds, extreme tides, high temperatures, <b>and</b> <b>muddy</b> soils, mangrove trees are uniquely adapted to extreme conditions. They act as nurseries for many marine and bird species. They are also Florida's first defense against the destructive forces of hurricanes, absorbing flood waters and preventing coastal erosion. The mangrove system in Everglades National Park is the largest continuous system of mangroves in the world.|$|E

5|$|Passengers {{said that}} the {{carriages}} of the train began rocking and swaying violently before the train left the rails and careered down an embankment, with the first carriages jack-knifing {{and most of the}} train coming to rest in a field. The train was reported as being evacuated around midnight. Emergency crews scanned the train with thermal imagery equipment to make sure there was no one still inside. Up to 500 rescuers attended the scene, along with at least 12 ambulances, at least five fire engines, three Royal Air Force Sea King search and rescue helicopters, the International Rescue Corps, three civilian mountain rescue teams plus RAF Leeming Mountain Rescue Team, and one Merseyside Police helicopter. The rescue operation was hindered by rain, darkness, and access problems caused by the narrow country lanes <b>and</b> <b>muddy</b> fields. Emergency vehicles experienced difficult conditions, needing to be towed by farm vehicles or tractors after becoming bogged down in mud.|$|E
5|$|Picton's probing {{attacks against}} the French center also met stiff resistance. Picton split the 3rd Division, sending Thomas Brisbane's brigade up the right spur toward Foy's {{position}} and Keane's brigade up the left spur toward Darmagnac's division. Keane was supported by Manley Power's Portuguese brigade from 3rd Division. Brisbane was followed up the right spur by Clinton's 6th Division. Since the valleys between the spurs were deep <b>and</b> <b>muddy,</b> both advances were restricted to narrow fronts. Picton's skirmishers quickly drove back the French outposts. When the leading brigades came under accurate artillery fire from the Escorial and Lafaurie knolls, Picton held back his formed troops and reinforced his skirmish line to seven British light companies, three 5th/60th Foot rifle companies and the entire 11th Caçadores Battalion. This heavy skirmish line moved forward until it {{came into contact with}} Soult's main defense line, but it was unable to press any farther. For two hours, Picton waited for Beresford's attack to make progress as the two sides skirmished.|$|E
5|$|On land, {{the river}} otter can walk, run, bound, or slide. Foot falls during walking and running follow the {{sequence}} of left limb, right limb, right limb, left limb. During walking, the limbs are moved in a plane parallel to the long axis of the body. Bounding {{is the result of}} simultaneous lifting of the limbs off the ground. As the front feet make contact with the ground, the back feet are lifted and land where the front paws first contacted the ground, producing a pattern of tracks in pairs typical of most mustelids. Sliding occurs mostly on even surfaces of snow or ice, but can also occur on grassy slopes <b>and</b> <b>muddy</b> banks. Sliding across snow and ice is a rapid and efficient means of travel, and otters traveling over mountain passes, between drainages, or descending from mountain lakes often slide continuously for several hundred meters. Rear leg paddling enables continuous sliding where gravity is an insufficient or an opposing force. During winter, the river otters heavily use openings in the ice, and may excavate passages in beaver dams for accessing open water.|$|E
