40|$|The article {{explores the}} {{potential}} of a Polanyian analysis for overcoming the current Manichean opposition between cosmopolitan globalizers and reactionary nationalists. For long, Karl Polanyi has inspired socio-economic thinking in different ways. First, his reflections {{on the end of}} the first period of globalization in the 1930 <b>s</b> <b>offer</b> insights for analysing the current political-economic situation. Furthermore, Polanyi contributes to an institutional analysis and utopian thinking towards a civilization for all. His approach enables a combination of a critique of current neoliberal globalization as a renewed version of the "liberal Utopia" with a cultural and ecological critique of capitalism as a mode of production and living. In this respect, Karl Polanyi may be contrasted to Friedrich Hayek, both contemporaries of Red Vienna, an ambitious project of local socialism as a step towards a "good life for all". The social and cultural struggles in Vienna during the 1920 s and 1930 <b>s</b> <b>offer</b> insights for current confrontations worldwide, but especially in Brazil where the reformist attempts of civilizing capitalism where confronted with severe opposition. Instead of the false polarization between globalization and nationalism, policies "for the select few" are opposed to policies "for all". Finally, Polanyi's reflections will be used to shed light onto the current impasse resulting from the illegitimate deposition of president Dilma Rousseff...|$|R

5000|$|The 8×64mm <b>S</b> is <b>offered</b> as a {{chambering}} {{option in}} some European hunting rifle manufacturer’s products palette. The 8×64mm S performance lies between the commercially important 8×57mm IS standard cartridge and the 8×68mm S magnum cartridge making it suitable for hunting {{all kinds of}} European game. In the year 2001 the Brenneke Company tried to revive the 8×64mm S cartridge by offering it loaded with 12.8 gram Brenneke Torpedo Ideal Geschoß (TIG) hunting bullets. Sellier & Bellot and Brenneke are currently (2007) the only ammunition manufacturers offering 8×64mm S factory loads. Loaded with short light bullets {{it can be used}} on small European game like roe deer and chamois. Loaded with long heavy bullets it can be used on big European game like boar, red deer, moose and brown bear. The 8×64mm <b>S</b> <b>offers</b> very good penetrating ability due to a fast twist rate that enables it to fire long, heavy bullets with a high sectional density.The 8×64mm S can be used in countries which ban civil use of former or current military ammunition. In France where the possession of rifles in their original military caliber is tightly regulated cartridges like the 8×64mm S allow French licensed gun owners to possess rifles based on the Mauser Gewehr 98 system under the less constraining [...] "hunting rifle" [...] category. The also rare 8×60mm <b>S</b> cartridge <b>offers</b> a comparable rechambering option for Mauser Gewehr 98 and Karabiner 98k based hunting rifles sporting 8 mm S-bores.

In any case, the glut will very likely have evaporated by 1990, when U. S. vulnerability will be sharply intensified. Despite the favorable opportunities for stockpiling and planning during the glut, the political process appears unable to respond. ...|$|R
