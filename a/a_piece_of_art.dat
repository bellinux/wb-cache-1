25|$|The {{implications}} of people's preference for novelty for human relationships are not straightforward and obvious. Evidence that people desire novelty comes primarily {{from studies of}} people's reactions to art objects and the like. This is different when it concerns human beings and social relationships because people can shift attention away from already familiar novel objects, while doing so in human relationships is difficult or not possible. But novel art objects {{are very different from}} people. If <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> becomes overly stimulating, we can simply shift our attention elsewhere. This is not a viable option should our spouse suddenly begin treating us as if we were someone else, for such treatment would pose serious questions about the integrity of people's belief systems. Consequently, people probably balance competing desires for predictability and novelty by indulging the desire for novelty within contexts in which surprises are not threatening (e.g., leisure activities), while seeking coherence and predictability in contexts in which surprises could be costly—such as in the context of enduring relationships.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} ideasthesia has been often {{discussed}} {{in relation to}} art, and also used to formulate a psychological theory of art. According to the theory, we consider something to be <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> when experiences induced by the piece are accurately balanced with semantics induced by the same piece. Thus, <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> makes us both strongly think and strongly experience. Moreover, the two must be perfectly balanced such that the most salient stimulus or event is both the one that evokes strongest experiences (fear, joy, ... and strongest cognition (recall, memory, ...) [...] in other words, idea is well balanced with aesthesia.|$|E

I wish there weren't such big gaps between them". In the same interview Bush denied she was a perfectionist in the studio, saying: [...] "I think it's important that things are flawed...

The video's inspiration stemmed from <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> created by the sculptor Allen Jones in the 1960s, involving the use of female mannequins as everyday pieces of furniture.

500|$|As a symbol, an urn cannot {{completely}} represent poetry, {{but it does}} {{serve as}} one component in describing the relationship between art and humanity. The nightingale of [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] is separated from humanity and does not have human concerns. In contrast, being <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> the urn requires an audience and is in an incomplete state on its own. This allows the urn to interact with humanity, to put forth a narrative, and allows for the imagination to operate. The images on the urn provoke the narrator to ask questions, and {{the silence of the}} urn reinforces the imagination's ability to operate. This interaction and use of the imagination is part of a greater tradition called ut pictura poesis – the contemplation of art by a poet – which serves as a meditation upon art itself. In this meditation, the narrator dwells on the aesthetic and mimetic features of art. The beginning of the poem posits that the role of art is to describe a specific story about those with whom the audience is unfamiliar, and the narrator wishes to know the identity of the figures {{in a manner similar to}} [...] "Ode on Indolence" [...] and [...] "Ode to Psyche". The figures on the urn within [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] lack identities, but the first section ends with the narrator believing that if he knew the story, he would know their names. The second section of the poem, describing the piper and the lovers, meditates on the possibility that the role of art is not to describe specifics but universal characters, which falls under the term [...] "Truth". The three figures would represent how Love, Beauty, and Art are unified together in an idealised world where art represents the feelings of the audience. The audience is not supposed to question the events but instead to rejoice in the happy aspects of the scene in a manner that reverses the claims about art in [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". Similarly, the response of the narrator to the sacrifice is not compatible with the response of the narrator to the lovers.|$|E
