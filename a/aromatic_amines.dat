25|$|<b>Aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> are {{chemicals}} that are produced when {{products such as}} dyes, polyurethane products, and certain pesticides are made. They are also found in cigarette smoke, fuel exhaust, and in over cooked, burned meat. The three types of <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> monocyclic, polycyclic, and heterocyclic have all been found in recent studies of breast health. Monocyclic amines {{have been found to}} cause mammary cancer in rats. Studies have shown that women who eat higher amounts of overcooked meat, meaning more exposure to heterocyclic amines, have also been diagnosed with more post-menopausal breast cancer. Heterocyclic amines also have the ability to copy estrogen and in laboratory studies have been found to encourage the growth of cancerous tumors on human tissue.|$|E

The unpleasant odor in industrial use tolytriazole comes from impurities in the product that are formed from the toluidine isomers (ortho-, meta- and para-toluidine) and meta-diamino toluene which are side-products {{in the manufacture of}} tolytriazole. These side-products are highly reactive and produce volatile <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> which are responsible for the unpleasant odor.|$|E
500|$|Nitrous acid (HNO2) is {{not known}} as a pure compound, but is a common {{component}} in gaseous equilibria and is an important aqueous reagent: its aqueous solutions may be made from acidifying cool aqueous nitrite ( [...] , bent) solutions, although already at room temperature disproportionation to nitrate and nitric oxide is significant. It is a weak acid with pK'a 3.35 at 18°C. They may be titrimetrically analysed by their oxidation to nitrate by permanganate. They are readily reduced to nitrous oxide and nitric oxide by sulfur dioxide, to hyponitrous acid with tin(II), and to ammonia with hydrogen sulfide. Salts of hydrazinium [...] react with nitrous acid to produce azides which further react to give nitrous oxide and nitrogen. Sodium nitrite is mildly toxic in concentrations above 100mg/kg, but small amounts are often used to cure meat and as a preservative to avoid bacterial spoilage.

2500|$|Commercial {{creosote}} {{will contain}} substances from six groups. The two groups {{occur in the}} greatest amounts and are {{the products of the}} distillation process—the [...] "tar acids", which distill below 205°C and consist mainly of phenols, cresols, and xylenols, including carbolic acid—and aromatic hydrocarbons, which divide into naphthalenes, which distill approximately between 205° and 255°C, and constituents of an anthracene nature, which distill above 255°C. The quantity of each varies based on the quality of tar and temperatures used, but generally, the tar acids won't exceed 5%, the naphthalenes will make up 15 to 50%, and the anthracenes will make up 45% to 70%. The hydrocarbons are mainly aromatic; derivatives of benzene and related cyclic compounds such as naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, acenapthene, and fluorene. Creosotes from vertical-retort and low temperature tars contain, in addition, some paraffinic and olefinic hydrocarbons. The tar-acid content also depends on the source of the tar—it may be less than 3% in creosote from coke-oven tar and as high as 32% in creosote from vertical retort tar. All of these have antiseptic properties. The tar acids are the strongest antiseptics but have the highest degree of solubility in water and are the most volatile; so, like with wood-tar creosote, phenols are not the most valued component, as by themselves they would lend to being poor preservatives. In addition, creosote will contain several products naturally occurring in coal—nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as acridines, carbazoles, and quinolines, referred to as the [...] "tar bases" [...] and generally make up about 3% of the creosote—sulfur-containing heterocycles, generally benzothiophenes—and oxygen-containing heterocycles, dibenzofurans. Lastly, creosote will contain a small number of <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> produced by the other substances during the distillation process and likely resulting from a combination of thermolysis and hydrogenation. The tar bases are often extracted by washing the creosote with aqueous mineral acid, although they're also suggested to have antiseptic ability similar to the tar acids.|$|E

5000|$|Polyfunctional primary amines form an {{important}} class of epoxy hardeners. Primary amines undergo an addition reaction with the epoxide group {{to form a}} hydroxyl group and a secondary amine. The secondary amine can further react with an epoxide to form a tertiary amine and an additional hydroxyl group. Kinetic studies have shown the reactivity of the primary amine to be approximately double that of the secondary amine. Use of a difunctional or polyfunctional amine forms a three-dimensional cross-linked network.Aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> are all employed as epoxy hardeners. Amine type will alter both the processing properties (viscosity, reactivity) and the final properties (mechanical, temperature and heat resistance) of the cured copolymer network. Thus amine structure is normally selected according to the application. Reactivity is broadly in the order aliphatic amines > cycloaliphatic amines > <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines.</b> Temperature resistance generally increases in the same order, since <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> form much more rigid structures than aliphatic amines.
