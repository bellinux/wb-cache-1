5|$|<b>Agriculture</b> <b>is</b> Saskatchewan's main {{industry}} and taking grain to elevators was first accomplished by horse and cart, {{to be replaced}} around World War I by truck travel. Long haul trucking flourished between 1950 and 1970. Since the 1970s, 17 {{times the number of}} grain trucks and 95 percent of goods transported now are hauled by truck across the Saskatchewan.|$|E
5|$|<b>Agriculture</b> <b>is</b> {{intensive}} and highly mechanised, producing 60% of food needs with only 2% of the labour force. Two thirds of production {{is devoted to}} livestock, the other to arable crops.|$|E
5|$|Although most of Jifna's {{cultivable}} land {{is covered}} with olive groves as well as fig, walnut and apricot trees and grape vines, <b>agriculture</b> <b>is</b> no longer the village's main source of income. Many of the village's former farmers are living off other businesses, including restaurants, other small family-owned industries, and simple commerce.|$|E

50|$|Two main {{competing}} scenarios {{exist for}} {{the spread of the}} Neolithic package from the Near East to Europe: demic diffusion (in which <b>agriculture</b> <b>was</b> brought by farmers) or cultural diffusion (in which <b>agriculture</b> <b>was</b> spread through the passage of ideas).|$|R
5|$|Extensive <b>agriculture</b> <b>is</b> {{found only}} in the province's {{southern}} areas, although there is grain farming in the Carrot Valley Region (near The Pas). The most common agricultural activity is cattle husbandry (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%). Around 12 percent of Canada's farmland is in Manitoba.|$|E
5|$|A {{danger to}} <b>agriculture</b> <b>is</b> wheat rust, a {{pathogenic}} fungus causing reddish patches, coloured by its spores. A virulent {{form of the}} wheat disease, stem rust, strain Ug99, spread from Africa across to the Arabian Peninsula by 2007. In field trials in Kenya, more than 85% of wheat samples, including major cultivars, were susceptible, implying that higher crop diversity was required. The Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug argued for action to ensure global food security.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{industries}} and sources have been implicated, including {{high levels of}} dust in coal mining, gold mining, and the cotton textile industry, occupations involving cadmium and isocyanates, and fumes from welding. Working in <b>agriculture</b> <b>is</b> also a risk. In some professions the risks have been estimated as equivalent to that of one half to two packs of cigarettes a day. Silica dust and fiberglass dust exposure {{can also lead to}} COPD, with the risk unrelated to that for silicosis. The negative effects of dust exposure and cigarette smoke exposure appear to be additive or possibly more than additive.|$|E
25|$|Agricultural {{organisation}} also changed. Unlike the Han and Tang, {{in which}} <b>agriculture</b> <b>was</b> dominated by self-sufficient farmers, or the pre-Warring States period and era of division (period between Han and Tang), which {{was dominated by}} aristocratic landowners, during the Song <b>agriculture</b> <b>was</b> dominated by non-aristocratic landowners. The majority of farmers no longer owned their land; they became tenants of these landowners, who developed the rural economy through investment. This system of <b>agriculture</b> <b>was</b> to continue until {{the establishment of the}} People's Republic of China under Mao.|$|R

5|$|<b>Agriculture</b> <b>is</b> another {{significant}} source of the Sava River basin surface water pollution, specifically through livestock manure production. It is estimated that the nutrient pollution levels generated by manure production equal 32,394tonnes of nitrogen and 3,784tonnes of phosphorus per year. As a consequence, the Sava River is microbiologically polluted in areas affected by the nutrient pollution. One such part of the river is the lowermost part of its course between Å abac and Belgrade, where acceptable freshwater bacterial counts are exceeded.|$|E
5|$|<b>Agriculture</b> <b>is</b> the {{dominant}} {{source of income}} in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century. After {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1865, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Agriculture</b> <b>is</b> the {{economic}} foundation of most countries, and {{for developing countries}} a likely source of economic growth. Growth in agriculture can benefit the rural poor, though it does not always do so. Profits from crops can increase from higher value crops, better marketing, value-adding activities such as processing, or expanded access {{for the public to}} markets.Profits can also decrease through reduced demand or increased production. Crop diversity can protect againstcrop failure, and can also offer higher returns.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{unemployment}} rate in Wyre is {{higher than that of}} the North West and England, in 2004 a Market Town Initiative study noted that the level of unemployment in Poulton was lower than the regional and national averages, at 1.41%. Business in the town is centred at the Poulton Industrial Estate. <b>Agriculture</b> <b>is</b> still important locally; in 2001 2.6% of workers in Wyre were employed in agriculture, hunting or forestry (compared to 1.2% in the North West and 1.5% in England).|$|E
5|$|Manitoba's economy {{relies heavily}} on agriculture, tourism, energy, oil, mining, and forestry. <b>Agriculture</b> <b>is</b> vital and is found mostly in the {{southern}} half of the province, although grain farming occurs {{as far north as}} The Pas. Around 12 percent of Canadian farmland is in Manitoba. The most common type of farm found in rural areas is cattle farming (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%).|$|E
5|$|Plants serve many {{functions}} in culture. The reliable provision of food through <b>agriculture</b> <b>is</b> {{the basis of}} civilization.

5|$|The Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) {{is a body}} {{composed}} of representatives from the states (ambassadors, civil servants etc.) who meet each week to prepare the work and tasks of the Council. It monitors and co-ordinates work and deals with the Parliament on co-decision legislation. It {{is divided into two}} groups of the representatives (Coreper II) and their deputies (Coreper I). <b>Agriculture</b> <b>is</b> dealt with separately by the Special Committee on Agriculture (SCA).

5|$|The Council is {{composed}} of twenty-eight national ministers (one per state). However the Council meets in various forms depending upon the topic. For example, if <b>agriculture</b> <b>is</b> being discussed, the Council will be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They represent their governments and are accountable to their national political systems. Votes are taken either by majority or unanimity with votes allocated according to population. In these various forms they share the legislative and budgetary power of the Parliament, and also lead the Common Foreign and Security Policy.|$|E
5|$|The Shannon Diversity Index, {{which is}} {{commonly}} {{used to measure the}} diversity of biological communities, of West Creek is slightly over 2.5. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index, a measure of pollution-tolerant macroinvertebrates, on much of the creek ranges from 1.6 to 2.5, although an area of the creek near Benton ranges from 2.6 to 3.5.

5|$|The {{economy of}} Slavonia is {{largely based on}} {{processing}} industry, trade, transport and civil engineering. <b>Agriculture</b> <b>is</b> a significant component of its economy: Slavonia contains 45% of Croatia's agricultural land and accounts for {{a significant proportion of}} Croatia's livestock farming and production of permanent crops. The gross domestic product (GDP) of the five counties of Slavonia is worth 6,454million euro or 8,005euro per capita, 27.5% below national average. The GDP of the five counties represents 13.6% of Croatia's GDP.|$|E
5|$|<b>Agriculture</b> <b>is</b> the {{mainstay}} of the Malagasy economy. Land {{is used for the}} cultivation of rice and other crops, raising of zebu and other livestock, the fabrication of bricks and other traditional livelihoods. In Antananarivo, access to land is guaranteed and protected by law for every resident of the city. The CUA manages requests to lease or purchase land, but demand dramatically outstrips supply and much of the unallocated land fails to meet the requisite criteria for parceling, such as land where floodwater runoff is diverted. Much of this marginal land has been illegally occupied and developed by land-seeking residents, creating shantytown slums in pockets throughout the lower portions of the city. This uncontrolled development poses sanitation and safety risks to residents in these areas.|$|E
