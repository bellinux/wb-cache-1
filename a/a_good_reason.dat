5|$|Social {{rigidification}} {{became a}} common feature of Soviet society. During the Stalin {{era in the}} 1930s and 1940s, a common labourer could expect promotion to a white-collar job if he studied and obeyed Soviet authorities. In Brezhnev's Soviet Union {{this was not the}} case. Holders of attractive positions clung to them as long as possible; mere incompetence was not seen as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to dismiss anyone. In this way, too, the Soviet society Brezhnev passed on had become static.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} {{of a change in}} weather was the sudden collapse of the market for specialized AI hardware in 1987. Desktop computers from Apple and IBM had been steadily gaining speed and power and in 1987 they became more powerful than the more expensive Lisp machines made by Symbolics and others. There was no longer <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to buy them. An entire industry worth half a billion dollars was demolished overnight.|$|E
5|$|After {{hearing of}} Scully collapsing, Mulder {{arrives at the}} {{hospital}} where Scully is being treated. Before {{he is able to}} make contact with her, he is detained by Skinner and two FBI agents. Mulder is then brought to Blevins and a senior agent who demands information on why Scully lied about Mulder's death. After the meeting, Mulder tells Skinner that a traitor in the FBI gave Scully her cancer. In the meantime, The Smoking Man has a meeting with the First Elder (Don S. Williams), trying to convince him that Mulder will join their side if he is given <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to do so.|$|E

50|$|In Reason in Ethics (1950), his {{doctoral}} dissertation, Toulmin {{sets out}} <b>a</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Reasons</b> approach of ethics, and criticizes {{what he considers}} to be the subjectivism and emotivism of philosophers such as A. J. Ayer because, in his view, they fail {{to do justice to}} ethical reasoning.|$|R

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to change one's coat of arms, with or without adopting or appending a new surname, by Royal Licence, {{that is to say}} a licence {{in the form of a}} warrant from the Crown directed to the Kings of Arms instructing them to exemplify the transferred arms or a version of them to the licensee in his or her new name. Royal Licences are issued on the advice of Garter King of Arms and are usually dependent on there being some constraining circumstances such as a testamentary injunction (a requirement in a will) or <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to wish to perpetuate a particular coat of arms. The Royal Licence is of no effect until and unless the exemplification is issued and recorded in the College. Royal Licences are gazetted and make a deed poll unnecessary.|$|E

"My being a lady is <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> why {{the gentlemen}} should always offer {{me the best}} seat," [...] said Mrs. Gray; [...] "but it {{is no reason why}} I should always take it. Indeed, it is <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> why I should not; for {{it is not at all}} ladylike to be monopolizing and selfish in respect to good seats and good places when there is any thing to see." ...|$|R

25|$|Magnan v. Anaconda Industries, Inc 193 Conn. 558, 479 A.2d 781 (1984) the Connecticut Supreme Court {{held that}} good faith was {{a rule of}} construction, which could not {{contradict}} the express terms of a contract. However, the rule of good faith did not require <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> for a discharge under Connecticut law.|$|E
25|$|A pre-Indo-European {{linguistic}} substratum in South Asia {{would be}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to exclude India {{as a potential}} Indo-European homeland. However, several linguists, all of whom accept the external origin of the Aryan languages on other grounds, are still open to considering the evidence as internal developments rather than the result of substrate influences, or as adstratum effects.|$|E
25|$|From {{the middle}} of the 19th century to 1930s, giant flow of {{immigration}} took place from Europe to North America. It is estimated that more than 60 million people crossed the Atlantic Ocean. Some politicians worried if these immigrants may cause various troubles (including cultural conflicts). For those politicians HO-theory provided <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> “in support of both restrictions on labor migration and free trade in goods”.|$|E

25|$|A Judge of the High Court is {{not bound}} by {{previous}} decisions by other High Court Judges. However, {{as a matter of}} comity, a Court will generally not depart from a previous decision unless there is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to do so, particularly if that decision has stood for some time. If there are conflicting High Court decisions, {{it is up to the}} Court of Appeal to decide which decision is correct.|$|E
25|$|With {{a bishop}} opening, it's common to {{exchange}} bishops by having one capture the other. This allows each player {{to put their}} newly captured bishop into play anywhere on the board, although {{care must be taken}} to avoid weaknesses in defense which may allow for a bishop drop. However, it is not advantageous to exchange bishops if your opponent has a better defensive setup, or more lines of attack. Moreover, making a bishop exchange constitutes one turn loss, so it's not advised without <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because {{the family}} {{spent much of}} his {{childhood}} travelling round Europe, most of his education was by private tutors. He only spent about two years in formal schooling, first at King's College School in London (then located in Somerset House) and then, for a few months, at Warwick Grammar School (now Warwick School). Here his time was ended by a bronchial disease of the kind that was to plague him throughout his long life. His father considered his ill-health as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> for another European tour.|$|E

25|$|Decisions of the High Court are {{binding on}} District Courts and Magistrates' Courts. However, a {{judge of the}} High Court is not bound by {{previous}} decisions by other High Court judges.

25|$|Under the {{principles}} of stare decisis (judicial precedent), the High Court is bound by decisions of the Court of Appeal. In turn, decisions of the High Court must be followed by District Courts and Magistrates' Courts. On the other hand, a Judge of the High Court is not bound by previous decisions by other High Court Judges. As a matter of comity, though, a Court will generally not depart from a previous decision unless there is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to do so. If there are conflicting High Court decisions, {{it is up to}} the Court of Appeal to decide which decision is correct.|$|E
25|$|Dellaconda {{itself is}} the next destination, as Chase and Alex {{continue}} their hunt for Hugh Scott. Alex visits Christopher Sim’s home and the school where he taught before the war; both are maintained as shrines to his memory. He locates and meets with Hugh Scott, in spite of Scott’s obvious reluctance. Scott will not say anything about theTenandrome mission, except {{to confirm that the}} survey ship found something and that there was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to keep it secret. Alex startles Scott by guessing that the Tenadrome had found a Dellacondan warship, but Scott will say no more.|$|E

25|$|After the An Shi Rebellion (755–763), {{the economy}} of {{northern}} China was greatly damaged and never recovered due to wars and to constant flooding of the Yellow River. Such a case occurred in the year 858 when an enormous flood along the Grand Canal inundated {{thousands of acres of}} farmland and killed {{tens of thousands of people}} in the North China Plain. Such an unfortunate event could reduce the legitimacy of a ruling dynasty by causing others to perceive it as having lost the Mandate of Heaven; this was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> for dynastic authorities to maintain a smooth and efficient canal system.|$|E
25|$|As an aristocrat and {{political}} intriguer, Gage viewed Rogers as a provincial upstart who posed {{a threat to}} his newly acquired power, due to his friendship with Amherst. At the time, Rogers was still a half-pay captain in the British army and, to some degree, under Gage's military jurisdiction. However, Gage could not challenge Rogers, the king's appointee, unless he could find <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason,</b> as the king would countermand any legal process {{in order to save}} his favorites. Knowing this, Gage actively set about finding an immutable justification to remove Rogers as royal governor {{in a way that would}} forestall royal intervention.|$|E
25|$|Although an American citizen {{for many}} years, Joe McManus {{continued}} {{to visit his}} Canadian friends and attend many Canadian meetings {{in spite of the}} numerous demanding professional and scientific positions which he held for more than 3 decades. His continuing interest in Canada and his support and friendliness towards our scientists at meetings is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> for Canadians to remember him. To those of us who met him later in his career it was apparent that he showed the fearlessness of a fighter, regardless of the odds against him whenever it seemed important to state his opinion on controversial scientific, professional or political problems. As a distinguished alumnus he was constantly in touch with Queens University and participated in the scientific program held during the 100th anniversary of the Queen's University Medical School.|$|E
