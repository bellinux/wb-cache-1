Diffusion-limited wildland fire flames have temperatures near 1000 °C regardless of size, with temperatures declining through the intermittent zone {{at the top}} of the flame and into the plume (i.e., the hot gases that rise from the flame; Depuy et al. 2003, Kremens et al. 2010). Therefore, even low intensity surface fires usually result in the top-killing of herbs and shrubs (Morgan and Neuenschwander 1988). The processes governing tissue heating during fires, that is, heat transfer from fires to vegetation and the heating of tissues that results, are discussed in Butler and Dickinson (2010) [...]...|$|E

40|$|Using {{interpretation}} as a {{means of}} influencing attitudes and knowledge is a core component of natural area management practice. However, this aspect of on-site interpretation is rarely assessed when evaluating natural area management success. This thesis examined the immediate influence of different intensities of on-site interpretation on attitudes and knowledge of visitors to natural areas. Measuring the immediate (short term) influence of a site experience enables clearer links to be made between survey responses and interpretation used at a specific site, something long term surveys are less able to achieve. Two sites from Western Australia (the Tree Top Walk and Penguin Island) were selected to compare the influence of high and low intensity use of interpretation on visitors. Both sites <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> <b>in</b> <b>being</b> relatively small and environmentally fragile with controlled visitor access in combination with an entrance fee, and managed by the same agency. One site adopted a low intensity on-site interpretation strategy with limited visitor activities, while the other had a high intensity use of interpretation with a range of visitor activities...|$|R

This bird can be distinguished from the otherwise similar scaled quail (C. squamata), California quail (C. californica), and Gambel's quail (C. gambelii) by the colour of the male's crest and by the paler spotting on the flanks.|$|R
40|$|SummaryArf 1 is a GTP binding {{protein that}} {{functions}} {{at a number}} of cellular sites to control membrane traffic and actin remodeling. Arf 1 is regulated by site-specific GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). The combined results of crystallographic and biochemical studies [1 – 3] have led to the proposal that Arf 1 GAPs differ in the specific interface formed with Arf 1. To test this hypothesis, we have used mutagenesis to examine the interaction of three Arf GAPs (ASAP 1, AGAP 1, and ArfGAP 1) with switch 1, switch 2, and α helix 3 of Arf 1. The GAPs <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> <b>in</b> <b>being</b> affected by mutations in switch 1 and 2. However, effects of a mutation within α helix 3 and specific mutations within switch 1 and 2 differed among the GAPs. The largest differences were observed with a change of isoleucine 46 to aspartate ([I 46 D]Arf 1), which reduced ASAP 1 -induced catalysis by ∼ 10, 000 -fold but had a 3 -fold effect on AGAP 1. The reduction was due to an isolated effect on the catalytic rate, kcat. In vivo [I 46 D]Arf 1 had no detectable effect on the Golgi apparatus but, instead, functioned as a constitutively active mutant in the cell periphery, affecting the localization of ASAP 1 and paxillin. Based on our results, we conclude that the contribution of specific residues within switch 1 of Arf to binding and achieving a transition state toward GTP hydrolysis differs among Arf GAPs...|$|R
40|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{effect of}} three novel methoxyimino derivatives of cephalosporin (cefotaxime [syn HR 756]; its anti isomer, R 02 5328 A; and the syn S-oxide derivative, HR 109) on the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan of Pseudomonas aeruginosa X- 48 was investigated. Cefotaxime {{at very low}} concentrations (50 % inhibition at 0. 025 microgram/ml) inhibited the transpeptidase reaction which catalyzes the incorporation and attachment of newly synthesized peptidoglycan to the preexisting cell wall sacculus. The S-oxide compound, HR 109, was a much less efficient inhibitor of this reaction (50 % inhibition at 0. 55 microgram/ml), whereas the anti isomer of cefotaxime, R 02 5328 A, had no inhibitory effect.

40|$|The {{morphology}} of the erythrosuchid {{ankle joint}} is reassessed. Two specimens, recently {{thought to have}} been incorrectly referred to Erythrosuchus africanus, are shown without doubt to belong to this taxon. Furthermore, the morphology <b>is</b> essentially <b>similar</b> to that of other early archosaurs. The tarsus of Erythrosuchus is poorly ossified and consists of a calcaneum, astragalus, and two distal tarsals. The calcanea of Erythrosuchus, Vjushkovia triplicostata, and Shansisuchus shansisuchus <b>are</b> all <b>similar</b> <b>in</b> <b>being</b> dorsoventrally compressed, possessing a lateral tuber, and lacking a perforating foramen. The astragalus of V. triplicostata is currently unknown. The astragalus of Shansisuchus is apparently unique in form. The erythrosuchid pes is therefore more derived than has been recently proposed. The tarsal morphology of several other archosauromorph taxa is reviewed and many details are found to be at variance with the literature. The plesiomorphic condition for the Archosauromorpha consists of four distal tarsals and a proximal row of three elements; two of which articulate with the tibia. These proximal elements are interpreted as the astragalus, calcaneum, and a centrale, and the same pattern is retained in the earliest archosaurs. This reassessed tarsal morphology has implications for the homology of the centrale an...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAmyloid fibrils are {{filamentous}} protein aggregates that {{accumulate in}} {{diseases such as}} Alzheimer's or type II diabetes. The amyloid-forming protein is disease specific. Amyloids may also be formed in vitro from many other proteins, after first denaturing them. Unlike the diverse native folds of these proteins, their amyloids <b>are</b> fundamentally <b>similar</b> <b>in</b> <b>being</b> rigid, smooth-sided, and cross-beta-structured, that is, with beta strands running perpendicular to the fibril axis. In the absence of high-resolution fibril structures, increasingly credible models are being derived by integrating data from a crossfire of experimental techniques. Most current models of disease-related amyloids invoke "beta arcades," columnar structures produced by in-register stacking of "beta arches. " A beta arch is a strand-turn-strand motif {{in which the two}} beta strands interact via their side chains, not via the polypeptide backbone as in a conventional beta hairpin. Crystal structures of beta-solenoids, a class of proteins with amyloid-like properties, offer insight into the beta-arc turns found in beta arches. General conformational and thermodynamic considerations suggest that complexes of 2 or more beta arches may nucleate amyloid fibrillogenesis in vivo. The apparent prevalence of beta arches and their components have implications for identifying amyloidogenic sequences, elucidating fibril polymorphisms, predicting the locations and conformations of beta arcs within amyloid fibrils, and refining existing fibril models...|$|R

40|$|Provision of {{continuing}} vocational training is subject to several market failures: capital-market imperfections (credit constraints), risk arising from variability of future values of skills, mismatch of costs and returns owing to worker mobility, and general positive externalities of human capital. In the light of these market imperfections we evaluate the contrasting French and British systems of adult training. French policy is interventionist and includes an employer training levy. British policy has abandoned levies and emphasizes individual initiatives by workers and employers. Despite contrasting policies, the character of training provision <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>in</b> both countries, <b>being</b> mainly arranged and financed by employers.
