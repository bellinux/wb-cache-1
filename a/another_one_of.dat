5|$|On 13 April 1968, in <b>another</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his {{frequent}} cabinet reshuffles, Bokassa demoted Banza to minister of health, but let him remain {{in his position}} as minister of state. Cognizant of the president's intentions, Banza increased his vocalization of dissenting political views. A year later, after Banza {{made a number of}} remarks highly critical of Bokassa and his management of the economy, the president, perceiving an immediate threat to his power, removed him as his minister of state.|$|E

5|$|An ossuary and a {{mausoleum}} were erected on {{the site}} of the massacre in 1955, as was a monument by the sculptor Vojin Bakić. In 1991, amid inter-ethnic violence during the Croatian War of Independence, the monument and the mausoleum were destroyed by Croatian nationalists, as was <b>another</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Bakić's works, Bjelovarac (The Man From Bjelovar). The ruins of the ossuary were removed by the local authorities in 2002. That same year, residents signed a petition to have the Bjelovarac monument erected once again. The restored monument was unveiled in December 2010.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Heffron's {{election}} promises, namely a Royal Commission {{into the}} legalisation of off-course betting, caused considerable tension {{with his own}} cabinet. His Attorney General Reg Downing favoured its legalisation through a government-supervised Totalisator Agency Board (TAB) while his Chief Secretary Gus Kelly favoured legalising the activities of existing SP bookmakers. Downing however, went over Heffron's head and procured an ALP State Executive order requiring {{the establishment of a}} TAB. When the Final Report of Commission was handed down on 29 March 1963, echoing the position of Downing, Heffron was obliged to carry out the establishment of the TAB.|$|E

Veltmann responded that this line of evidence was news to him, too. The next day, Coakley gave the press a statement accusing Veltmann of coaching McPherson.|$|E

5|$|Burger King {{introduced}} the Specialty Sandwich line under its Burger King and I promotional campaign {{developed by the}} J. Walter Thompson (JWT) agency. The advertisements featured customers and employees praising the new sandwiches accompanied with {{a brief description of}} the products being sold. Actor Stuart Pankin played a doorman in one commercial in the series. <b>Another</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the promotions used was a scratch card game called What's my Specialty? where the customer would receive a card with their purchase in which they would have to match famous people to said person's profession. The commercial explained that if you expected to lose, you would be disappointed, as all cards were winners. Prizes included fries, sodas and sandwiches.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} career, {{he played in}} a variety of attacking positions. Although he usually {{operated}} inside the penalty area as a main striker or centre-forward, his wide range of skills also allowed him to play in a more withdrawn role, as an inside forward or second striker, or out wide. In his later career, he took on more of a deeper playmaking role behind the strikers, often functioning as an attacking midfielder. Pelé’s unique playing style combined speed, creativity, and technical skill with physical power, stamina, and athleticism. His excellent technique, balance, flair, agility, and dribbling skills enabled him to beat opponents with the ball, and frequently saw him use sudden changes of direction and elaborate feints in order to get past players, such as his trademark move, the drible da vaca. <b>Another</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his signature moves was the paradinha, or little stop.|$|E

5|$|Ion I. Agârbiceanu (1907–1971) was {{the author}} of {{pioneering}} work in spectroscopy, famed for his invention of a gas laser. <b>Another</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the writers' sons was a surveyor. He and his family remained in possession of Agârbiceanu's large villa in Cluj, which was later declared a historic monument. The writer's grave was awarded the same status by Romania's Culture Ministry in 2012. Among the localities associated with Agârbiceanu's work, Bucium is home to a Fefeleaga Memorial House, a modern reconstruction which used Romanian folk houses as a blueprint; Sofia Danciu's actual home burned down in summer 2014.|$|E
5|$|Moodu Pani marked A. R. Rahman's first {{association}} with Ilaiyaraaja; the former (then known by his birth name Dilip) {{worked as a}} keyboardist in the film. During the re-recording of Moodu Pani soundtrack and score, Ilaiyaraaja fired his original keyboardist, due to the person's drinking behaviour. At that time, <b>another</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his troupe members asked Ilaiyaraaja to meet a boy named Dilip, {{who knew how to}} play the keyboard. Ilaiyaraaja agreed and sent for Dilip, whom he instructed regarding the notes and tune he had to play. Dilip, under Ilaiyaraaja's supervision, successfully completed the re-recording process.|$|E
5|$|One of Favre's {{properties}} on the Pearl River {{was originally}} settled {{by his father}} in 1767, and was inherited by Favre upon his father's death in 1782. This plantation later {{became known as the}} town of Napoleon, and Favre kept a store there that later became a part of the community's church. In 1961 all the residents of the town were moved when the property was declared within the buffer zone of the John C. Stennis Space Center. <b>Another</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his Pearl River properties became the town of Pearlington, Mississippi, where many of his children, including those of his Choctaw mistress, lived.|$|E

5|$|Prost {{was married}} to Anne-Marie (born 14 February 1955), but they {{divorced}} sometime later. They have two sons, Nicolas (born 18 October 1981) and Sacha Prost (born 30 May 1990). Prost also has a daughter, Victoria. , Nicolas races in Formula E for e.dams Renault, a team partially run by his father. Prost lived in his hometown, Saint-Chamond, until he and his Renault team fell out in the early 1980s. In April 1983 the Prost family moved to Sainte-Croix, Switzerland, and shortly after to Yens, Switzerland. They moved to Switzerland after Renault workers went to Prost's house in France and burned his Mercedes-Benz and <b>another</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his road cars. They lived there until November 1999, when they moved to Nyon in the same country. In December 2015, Prost became a grandfather {{with the birth of}} Nicolas Prost's son Kimi.|$|E
5|$|After Bahá'u'lláh died on 29 May 1892, the Will and Testament of Bahá'u'lláh {{named his}} son `Abdu'l-Bahá as Centre of the Covenant, {{successor}} and interpreter of Bahá'u'lláh's writings, and the appointment was readily accepted by almost all Bahá'ís, since the appointment was written and unambiguous, and `Abdu'l-Bahá had proved himself a capable and devoted assistant. However, the appointment given to `Abdu'l-Bahá was {{a cause of}} jealousy within Bahá'u'lláh's family. Bahá'u'lláh had also stated that <b>another</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his sons Mírzá Muhammad `Alí was to be subordinate and second in rank after `Abdu'l-Bahá. Mírzá Muḥammad `Alí, however, insisted that `Abdu'l-Bahá was exceeding his powers, and started a rebellion, at first covert, and then public to discredit `Abdu'l-Bahá. Mírzá Muḥammad `Alí's actions, however, were rejected {{by the majority of}} the Bahá'ís. Due to this conflict, `Abdu'l-Bahá later ex-communicated his brother as a covenant-breaker. The conflict was not long lived; after being alienated by the Bahá'í community, Muhammad Ali died in 1937 with a handful of followers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Bowerman's pupils, Phil Knight, {{partnered with}} Bowerman and {{revolutionized}} the sport with {{the formation of}} the shoe company giant, Nike. Knight graduated from the University of Oregon in 1959 and went on to Stanford University for graduate school. There, he developed the idea to import Japanese running shoes to the American market. After earning his MBA from Stanford, he returned to the University of Oregon where he and Bowerman struck a handshake deal in 1964, each with a $500 investment into a company called Blue Ribbon Sports to import Japanese running shoes. In the late 1960s, Bowerman's pursuit of lighter shoes for his athletes led him to develop a sole by pouring rubber into his wife's waffle iron, inventing the modern running shoe. After Knight decided to rename the company Nike and develop its own shoes, Bowerman's invention became the prototype for the company. The shoe made its debut in the 1972 Olympic Trials at Hayward Field with Steve Prefontaine as one of the early endorsers. Although Bowerman retired from coaching in 1972, he remained on Nike's board until 1999. In that time, Nike exploded into a multibillion-dollar company.|$|E
