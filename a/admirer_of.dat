Van Gogh instead worked on interpretations of other artist's paintings, such as Millet's The Sower and Noonday Rest, and variations on his own earlier work.

5|$|Another Canadian <b>admirer</b> <b>of</b> {{the painted}} turtle is Jon Montgomery, {{who won the}} 2010 Olympic gold medal in {{skeleton}} (a form of sled) racing, while wearing a painted turtle painting on the crown of his helmet, prominently visible when he slid downhill.

BC Hydro referred to Montgomery's action when describing its own sponsorship of conservation research for the turtle in British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|At {{around this}} time Etty began to receive many {{unsolicited}} letters from wealthy Old Etonian lawyer Thomas Myers. Myers was a huge <b>admirer</b> <b>of</b> Etty, and his letters mainly suggest literary topics he felt Etty ought to be painting so as {{to appeal to the}} nobility; he wrote regularly between July 1832 and May 1844. Although eccentric and largely incoherent (one of his suggestions was for Etty to raise his profile by painting nude portraits of the wives of the aristocracy), Etty appears to have taken at least some of Myers's suggestions seriously.|$|E

5|$|Carpentier {{was a great}} <b>admirer</b> <b>of</b> Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes, having cited him in {{a number}} of {{different}} texts throughout his career. The Prologue begins with a quote from Cervantes' Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda (Persiles and Sigismunda), which is subsequently mentioned, with a focus on the character of Rutilio. The mention of Rutilio is noteworthy, as the episode has been of interest to critics due to its magical subject matter, concerning lycanthropy. Both works feature a distant and exotic land where the marvellous is present by means of metamorphoses, and viewed from the characters' perspective.|$|E
5|$|During {{his student}} years in England, Jinnah was {{influenced}} by 19th-century British liberalism, like many other future Indian independence leaders.

He became an <b>admirer</b> <b>of</b> the Parsi British Indian political leaders Dadabhai Naoroji and Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. Naoroji had become the first British Member of Parliament of Indian extraction shortly before Jinnah's arrival, triumphing with a majority of three votes in Finsbury Central.

Galileo's resulting book, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was published in 1632, with formal authorization from the Inquisition and papal permission.|$|E

5|$|In France, the premiership of Aristide Briand, {{a leading}} proponent of {{engaging}} with Constantine {{to bring about}} a reconciliation of the two Greek administrations, was threatened by the events in Athens, leading to the reorganization of the French government. In Britain, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and foreign minister Sir Edward Grey resigned and were replaced by Lloyd George and Arthur Balfour. The change in the British leadership proved to be particularly important for Greece, since Lloyd George was a known Hellenophile, an <b>admirer</b> <b>of</b> Venizelos and dedicated to resolving the Eastern Question.|$|E
