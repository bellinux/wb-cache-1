5|$|Actress Sheryl Lee {{was first}} {{cast as the}} {{deceased}} character Laura Palmer in Twin Peaks. However, Lynch soon asked her to play the second role of Madeline Ferguson throughout the series; Lee would reprise her role as Palmer in the series' feature-film sequel , <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> brief appearance in Wild at Heart, which was filmed concurrently with Twin Peaks.

5|$|After Tatum {{resigned}} to coach {{at his own}} alma mater, North Carolina, Tommy Mont was appointed as his replacement. In his first season, Maryland was riddled with injuries and posted a disappointing 2–7–1 record. Mont had great difficulty recruiting to the same standard that his predecessor had, but managed to secure Rod Breedlove, a highly touted guard prospect. Breedlove later went on to play {{eight years in the}} NFL <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> Pro Bowl appearance.|$|E
5|$|Although Mendelssohn {{attributed}} {{great importance}} to musical education, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> substantial commitment to the Conservatoire he founded in Leipzig, he did not greatly enjoy teaching and took only a very few private pupils who he believed had notable qualities. Amongst such students were the composer William Sterndale Bennett, the pianist Camille-Marie Stamaty, the violinist and composer Julius Eichberg, and Walther von Goethe (grandson of the poet). At the Leipzig Conservatoire Mendelssohn taught classes in composition and ensemble playing.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} above, John Scannella {{had argued}} in 2010 that Nedoceratops {{should be considered}} a synonym of Triceratops. Andrew Farke (2011) maintained that it represents a valid distinct genus. Nick Longrich agreed with Scannella about Nedoceratops <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> further suggestion: that the recently described Ojoceratops was likewise a synonym. The fossils, he argued, are indistinguishable from the T. horridus specimens that were previously attributed to the defunct species T. serratus.|$|E

5|$|At a Sunday {{church service}} in mid-December, in what Marshall {{believed}} {{was an attempt}} by other officials {{to force him to}} assume the presidency, a courier brought a message informing him that Wilson had died. Marshall was shocked, and rose to announce the news to the congregation. The ministers held a prayer, the congregation began singing hymns, and many people wept. Marshall and his wife exited the building, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> call to the White House to determine his next course of action, only to find that he had been the victim of a hoax, and that Wilson was still living.|$|E
5|$|Baker was {{promoted}} to temporary captain <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> flight commander in No.4 Squadron on 24 October. Two days later, Baker and Lieutenant Thomas Barkell led a formation of nine Snipes. As the patrol drew near Tournai in the afternoon, they intercepted a group of 15 Fokker D.VIIs. The Snipes swept towards the German aircraft, and Baker attempted to engage the formation leader, but the machine guns on his Snipe jammed. He brought in his aircraft for a second attempt, and managed to shoot the Fokker down out of control. In all, the Australians destroyed five of the Fokkers before the engagement ended.|$|E
5|$|By April 1917 Heseltine had again {{tired of}} London life.

By the summer of 1917, as Allied fortunes in the war stagnated, Heseltine's military exemption came under review; to forestall a possible conscription, in August 1917 he moved to Ireland, taking Puma, {{with whom he had}} decided he was, after all, in love.|$|E

5|$|Coggins {{served as}} an artist for British YANK in London until August 2, 1945 and was {{discharged}} from the U.S. Army on November 3, 1945. While in Britain, Coggins spent time on a Royal Navy convoy in the North Sea, witnessed the bombing of Saint-Lô, and flew over Berlin in a Lancaster bomber.

Events from all of these sorties were illustrated in YANK magazine in double page spreads. During his time in Britain, Coggins wrote articles on war rockets and the German Navy which were also published in YANK.|$|E

The storm dissipated rapidly as it proceeded inland, and the remnant low pressure area moved into Georgia and South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Crawford {{continued}} her reign {{as a popular}} movie actress well into the mid-1930s. No More Ladies (1935) co-starred Robert Montgomery and then-husband Franchot Tone, and was a success. Crawford had long pleaded with MGM's head Louis B. Mayer to cast her in more dramatic roles, and although he was reluctant, he cast her in the sophisticated comedy-drama I Live My Life (1935), directed by W.S. Van Dyke. It was well received by critics <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> larger profit than the studio had expected.|$|E
5|$|Critics cite {{a number}} of {{problems}} with the conviction. Local newspaper coverage, even before Frank was officially charged, was deemed to be inaccurate and prejudicial. Some claimed that the prosecutor Hugh Dorsey was under pressure for a quick conviction because of recent unsolved murders <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> premature decision that Frank was guilty, a decision that his personal ambition would not allow him to reconsider. Later analysis of evidence, primarily by Governor Slaton and Conley's attorney William Smith, seemed to exculpate Frank while implicating Conley.|$|E

5|$|Decoy {{was ordered}} on 2 February 1931 under the 1930 Naval Estimates, and was laid down at John I. Thornycroft & Company's yard at Woolston, Southampton, on 25 June 1931. She was {{launched}} on 7 June 1932 and completed on 17 January 1933, {{at a total}} cost of £225,236, excluding equipment supplied by the Admiralty, such as weapons, ammunition and wireless equipment. The ship was initially assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> brief deployment to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea in September–October 1933.

In 1972, J. R. S. Phillips printed a complete transcription of the Boulogne agreement in his book Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke 13071324.|$|E
