5|$|It's a {{very passionate}} song. It's really, I think maybe, the most passionate {{one on the}} record. I mean, I'm really proud of it because that's really one that goes {{over-the-top}} {{in the sense that}} it's got images - it has religious imagery of resurrection, it's got images of fertility and rebirth, it has really very good sexual images, images of cars - which I <b>always</b> <b>like.</b>|$|E
5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's <b>always</b> <b>like</b> I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E

25|$|The {{band was}} a lot of fun. I think there was great rapport between the people in it. And none of us wanted to leave. We were always getting sort of offers from other bands for much more money than we were making with Woody, and it was <b>always</b> <b>like</b> if you left, you were a rat. You were really letting down the team.|$|E

The combination sh is pronounced like English sh.|$|E
25|$|During the off-season, English {{attended}} Boston University {{evenings and}} Saturdays to attain her degree. But combining baseball with {{going to college}} nights took her nine years to graduate. Nevertheless, playing professional baseball did help to pay her college expenses. Before the 1951 season, when the team moved from Racine, Wisconsin to Battle Creek, Michigan, English and some original Belles members were disappointment and decided {{not to make the}} move. During eight years, the Belles were a close-knit team, <b>always</b> <b>like</b> a family away from home. English and teammates thought that all would be different, like a new team, maybe a new manager and, specially, a new location.|$|E

25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I <b>always</b> <b>like</b> to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E
25|$|Pope John Paul II Park Reservation: The Pope John Park Reservation is {{approximately}} 66 acres in size, {{and is also}} open year-round for the residents of Dorchester. In its earlier times it {{was used as a}} landfill and also a drive-in theatre. It also serves as a barricade between the Town of Dorchester, Boston and Neponset River waterfront. This park now gives residents various resources such as; Picnic facilities, soccer fields, play areas, paths for walking, and also spacious land to plant trees and shrubs. Unfortunately, it was not <b>always</b> <b>like</b> this. In May 2015, According to James W. Dolan, Pope John Paul Park Reservation was not the same as it used to be. The State Department of Conservation and Recreation, which is responsible for the park, is not really doing its job. The plants are either dead or overgrown. There are no gardens or trees that would catch anyone's eye and also no picnic tables or grills where families could gather around and do a cookout. Dolan states that he wants to see people of the community planting vegetables and tending flower beds in the park, paddling canoes in the river, and also a grove of trees so people could sit in the shade and look out at the river.|$|E

He stated, [...] "The analogy that I <b>always</b> <b>like</b> to use {{is the word}} [...] "continent". You know, the word [...] "continent" [...] has no scientific definition ... they're just cultural definitions, and I think the geologists are wise to leave that one alone and not try to redefine things so that the word [...] "continent" [...] has a big, strict definition." ...|$|E

500|$|Oates {{was one of}} the NHL's great playmakers, a {{style that}} he credits his father as encouraging: [...] "It was just kind of our family talks: 'If you can be unselfish, your {{teammates}} will <b>always</b> <b>like</b> you.' And it just kind of became my role, where I was obviously trying to please my dad, growing up and becoming a playmaker out of that." [...] Oates' father, a British immigrant, idolized Stanley Matthews, considered one of the greatest soccer players of all time and hoped that his son would adopt a pass-first mentality similar to Matthews.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked by}} Rolling Stone editor, David Wild {{why he was}} {{performing}} the album again live after forty years, Morrison replied: [...] "It received no promotion, from Warner Bros.—that's why I never got to play the songs live. [...] I {{had always wanted to}} play the record live and fully orchestrated—that is what this is all about. [...] I <b>always</b> <b>like</b> live recording and I like listening to live records too. [...] I'm not too fond of being in a studio—it's too contrived and too confining. I like the freedom of live, in-the-moment sound." ...|$|E
500|$|Though DeLonge {{hoped to}} retain the angst present in the band's past work, he wanted to [...] "deliver it in a package that's very modern, using {{instrumentations}} and formulas to launch you into different places with music that is not just three-chord pop-punk with riffs." [...] He later felt the album was not progressive as he had wished: [...] "I'm thinking, 'Why don't we do this? Why don't we create these landscapes?' I {{think we should have}} been pushing ourselves, and trying to push the genre forward." [...] Likewise, Barker felt DeLonge wanted their music to be derivative of groups such as U2 or Coldplay, commenting, [...] "For us, we were <b>always</b> <b>like</b> 'Blink is Blink, man. We want to sound like fucking Blink-182.'" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Angel of Death" [...] caused outrage among Holocaust survivors, as well {{as their}} {{families}} and the general public. The controversy led to accusations of Nazi sympathizing which have followed Slayer throughout their career. People took Hanneman's interest in Nazi history and his collection of Nazi medals, his most prized item being a German Knight's Cross, as evidence of sympathizing. Hanneman objected, stating: [...] According to guitarist Kerry King: [...] "Yeah, 'Slayer are Nazis, fascists, Communists'—all that fun shit. And of course we got the most flak for it in Germany. I was <b>always</b> <b>like,</b> 'Read the lyrics and tell me what's offensive about it. Can you see it as a documentary, or do you think Slayer's preaching fucking World War II?' People get this thought in their heads—especially in Europe—and you'll never talk them out of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{minutes of}} the film showed Palestinians playing at war for the cameras, they wrote, falling down as if wounded, then getting up and walking away. A France2 {{official}} told them, [...] "You know it's <b>always</b> <b>like</b> that," [...] a comment that Leconte said he found disturbing given the controversy. Christine Delavennat, France 2's communications director, said {{that none of the}} scenes in the footage had been staged. Jeambar and Leconte concluded that the shots had come from the Palestinian positions, given the trajectory of the bullets. Leconte said in an interview: [...] "If they had been Israeli bullets, they would be very strange bullets because they would have needed to go around the corner." [...] He dismissed France2's explanation—that perhaps the bullets that hit the boy had ricocheted off the ground. [...] "It could happen once, but that there should be eight or nine of them, which go around a corner? They're just saying anything." ...|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg {{used some}} {{character}} designs from his comic book. He designed [...] "SpongeBob's grumpy next door neighbor" [...] as an octopus because the species' large head; octopi, he said, [...] "have {{such a large}} bulbous head and Squidward thinks he's an intellectual so of course, he's gonna have a large bulbous head." [...] Hillenburg drew Squidward with six tentacles because [...] "it was really just simpler for animation to draw him with six legs instead of eight". Show writer and storyboard artist Vincent Waller said: Squidward is hard to drawhe has a very odd-shaped head. Fortunately, his emotions are pretty even, but to get {{a whole lot of}} big emoting out of him is a challenge. His nose splits everything in half, so it's <b>always</b> <b>like,</b> 'OK, how am I going to work this and still make it read?' Hillenburg thought of making jokes with Squidward ejecting ink but retired it because, according to him, [...] "it always looks like he's pooping his pants". However, it occurs in [...] and the sixth season episode, [...] "Giant Squidward".|$|E

[...] Additionally, he makes reference to strippers, as well as driving with a suspended drivers' license. Throughout the bridge, Carey sings about achieving despite surrounding odds: [...] "In spite of the chains that bind you/ You can see the mountain top/ It’s not too far." [...] Additionally, towards the last chorus, the singer releases a series of her [...] "signature" [...] high notes. During an August 2, conference call, Carey described how she felt working with the duo, and how she felt Ross' voice blended well with her own: [...] "Working with Ross and Meek on the same record was incredible. Obviously Ross is a star and everybody loves him. I'm a fan of his music," [...] said Carey on the collaboration. [...] "I really, really {{wanted to work with}} him. I love the tone of his voice.

500|$|Although {{suddenly}} {{very wealthy}} and successful, {{much of the}} band and its entourage now struggled with heroin addiction. Four individuals — group leader Duane Allman, bassist Berry Oakley, and roadies Robert Payne and Joseph [...] "Red Dog" [...] Campbell — checked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971. Their addictions had begun to affect their performances and matters seemed to only be getting worse, according to many involved. The clinic was deemed a [...] "joke" [...] and a [...] "nuthouse" [...] by Payne and Red Dog, and was later described {{as more of a}} psychiatric ward, as true rehabilitation clinics were several years away. All involved (including Duane) struggled to keep off the substance in the ensuing days. Despite this, Duane fueled the band's passion to get better and end their addictions: [...] "Duane was so happy and full of positive energy. He was <b>always</b> <b>like</b> that unless he was just totally wasted. He was the leader, the great soul, and he kept saying, 'We are on a mission and it's time for this thing to happen,'" [...] said Linda Oakley. [...] "He was moving forward, and that energized everyone else. Everyone fed off of that." ...|$|E
500|$|Joel Keller of AOLTV complimented Jones in [...] "A Very Glee Christmas" [...] for [...] "shining in this storyline" [...] as Coach Beiste: [...] "Her {{scene as}} Santa, {{and then her}} knowing {{expression}} as she watched Artie walk, were the best moments of the episode." [...] The Atlantic Patrick Burns agreed: Jones's [...] "performance as the Santa Claus bearer of harsh reality was quite moving. It's nice to see her get to show her acting chops and refreshing to see her character's vulnerability." [...] Poniewozik also agreed, and said Jones [...] "has been remarkable", [...] "taking every ridiculous moment Glee has thrown at her and finding the true emotion {{at the core of}} the absurdity, which is what Glee at its best does." [...] A similar sentiment was expressed by VanDerWerff in his review of the following episode, [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle": [...] "I also like Coach Beiste because she’s one of the few characters who seems to grasp how insane some of this is. I <b>always</b> <b>like</b> when a show that frequently goes over the top introduces someone who’s able to undercut some of that ridiculousness." ...|$|E
