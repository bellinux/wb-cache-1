5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E

While the {{newspapers}} sounded the alarm to alert people to the danger, and while appeals were made to the public authorities to do something about it, song-writers, satirists and other men of wit and spirit, provoked great pleasure among the leisured classes by playing with the word 'cube', discovering that it was a very suitable means of inducing laughter which, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> know, is the principle characteristic that distinguishes man from the animals.|$|E

25|$|Like {{all great}} artists, Licia's {{specific}} ingenuity as a singer, the originality of her art, {{lay in the}} fact that technique for this artist at least was always {{a means to an end}} and never an end in itself: for the salient features of all great art is the ability to connect technique to the emotions. Any other approach would have been for Albanese contrary to the musical sense with which she was born, contrary to musical training she acquired, and, if such exists, contrary to her musical morality. It was this, Licia's uniqueness and musical mastery which drew me, which drew us, into the world of Mimi, Cio-Cio-San, Manon, Liu and Violetta week after week, year after year, inviting me to a place and places I had never been before. It is for all these reasons that Virgil Thomson was able to write of Licia's first Violetta: 'She did not sing the role, she recreated it for our times.' <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> know, Albanese's art is capable of the widest range of effects from the tragic to the comedic, from dramatic repertoire to the lyrical and even soubrette: and for anyone fortunate enough to have heard her rendition of operetta pieces, she leaves no doubt in the mind that she was born to the operetta form as well as to the rest.|$|E

Give me the Thunderer, the hull of the Thunderer; she had bad engines, she was not arranged as I would like inside, she was badly gunned <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> know, and she had not enough light gun or sufficient armaments; but she carried [...] of coal, could steam at 10 knots from here to the Cape, and could fight any ship of her class on the salt water." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of Lewis' {{performance}} at the London Palladium on 5 March, William J Connolly of Gay Times praised the singer's openness regarding her personal and private life throughout the show, which gave the audience an insight as to [...] "why she's remained quiet in previous months and why, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> love, each album is full of emotion and honesty". He singled out [...] "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face", [...] "Bleeding Love", and [...] "Thunder" [...] as the show's highlights, and described [...] "Run" [...] as [...] "perfect". Emma Noye of the Ipswich Star wrote that despite there being some Americanisms in the show, such as [...] "horse-riding, beach-walking backing visuals with a voiceover talking about the 'journey' she's been on", Lewis' voice was [...] "indisputably fantastic". Noye went on to write that the singer [...] "made everyone feel included and engaged" [...] and praised her performance of [...] "Ave Maria" [...] as [...] "stunning".|$|E

500|$|The {{writing of}} the album did not start until a year after La Dispute's debut album, Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair, was released. Part {{of the reason for}} the delay was the band's {{continuous}} touring and promotion of the debut across the United States and Canada, with rare tour and festival appearances in Europe and Australia. When commenting on the delay between the band's album releases, singer Jordan Dreyer said he {{and the rest of the}} band members require [...] "an absurdly long gestation period with these types of things and then we have to really sit down and be as meticulous <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> want to be". The band decided to use lyrical elements that they had intended to use in the first album but that were not included because they did not seem fully developed at the time. While writing La Dispute, the band had very specific goals; they projected the album to have 14 tracks and knew exactly what they wanted from each song.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Hidden Place" [...] was {{directed}} by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin and co-directed by M/M (Paris). It was shot in London over four days in February 2001. It was originally planned for a song from Selmasongs, but Björk felt the project was more appropriate for Vespertine. The video consists of close-up shots panning around Björk's face, as fluids flow {{in and out of}} her facial orifices. M/M (Paris) explained the concept behind the video:We always wanted to get as close to her as we could, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> felt she had never been portrayed as the [...] "real" [...] and beautiful woman she is. This is somehow taboo, to observe a pop star with no makeup from a distance of half an inch. Then the idea of the liquid works as a visualization of all possible emotions pulsating and circulating in her very busy brain. The loop idea was a main point for us as well, trying to extend the usual time frame of pop video super-fast editing, to make it hypnotising, mesmerising and irritating, like an eternally burning fireplace.|$|E
500|$|The Fountains {{theme of}} fear of death is [...] "a {{movement}} from darkness into light, from black to white" [...] that traces the journey of a man scared of death and moving toward it. The film begins with a paraphrase of Genesis 3:24, the Biblical passage that reflects The Fall of Man. Hugh Jackman {{emphasized the importance of}} the Fall in the film: [...] "The moment Adam and Eve ate of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, humans started to experience life <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> experience it now, which is life and death, poor and wealthy, pain and pleasure, good and evil. We {{live in a world of}} duality. Husband, wife, we relate everything. And much of our lives are spent not wanting to die, be poor, experience pain. It's what the movie's about." [...] Aronofsky also interpreted the story of Genesis as the definition of mortality for humanity. He inquired of the Fall, [...] "If they had drank from the Tree of Life [...] what would have separated them from their maker? So what makes us human is actually death. It's what makes us special." ...|$|E

Additionally, the song is reminiscent of [...] "Belle" [...] and [...] "Something There" [...] from Beauty and the Beast, specifically {{when it comes to}} its bridge and [...] "staccato quality". Written in the key of D major in alla breve cut common time, [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] is structured around a [...] "lilting", Broadway musical-inspired melody. According to the song's official sheet music, published at Musicnotes.com by Walt Disney Music Publishing, [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] follows an upbeat, [...] "perky and live" [...] tempo of 88 beats per minute. In portrayal of Giselle, Adams performs the song using an [...] "earnest", [...] "tart... soprano voice". Her high soprano vocal range spans approximately two octaves, from the low note of G#3 to the high note of D5. The song's lyrics begin, [...] "Come, my little friends, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> sing a happy little working song, merry little voices clear and strong." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{week after}} the match against Surrey, the only Test match of the Australian's tour was played, also at the Oval. In his {{obituary}} in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, {{it was suggested that}} {{were it not for the}} accusations of throwing against Crossland, he would have been selected for the match. Cricket agreed, submitting that due to Fred Morley's absence from the England team due to injury, Crossland was the obvious choice to replace him, as he was the best fast bowler in the country. Despite this, they said that his non-selection showed that his action was not deemed fair by the selection panel. The Morning Post went a step further, and claimed that as Crossland had demonstrated he was England's best fast bowler, he should be selected to play in the Test match if his action was deemed fair, but that if it was not considered fair, he should not be allowed to continue to play for Lancashire either. An article written for The Argus, an Australian daily newspaper, by an unnamed member of the Australian side in 1882 reported that Crossland bowled; [...] "with a delivery so like a throw that I feel sure it would not be allowed in Australia; but, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> know, throwing in England is just as common as bowling – more's the pity", and it was speculated that the Australian team would have protested had Crossland been chosen for the Test match.|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} {{still searching for}} a lead singer. Chimes recalls one Billy Watts (who [...] "seemed to be, like, {{nineteen}} or eighteen then, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> were") handling the duties for a time. Rhodes had his eye on Strummer, with whom he made exploratory contact. Jones and Levene had both seen him perform and were impressed as well. Strummer, for his part, was primed to make the switch. In April, he had taken in the opening act {{for one of his}} band's gigs—the Sex Pistols. Strummer later explained:I knew something was up, so I went out in the crowd which was fairly sparse. And I saw the future—with a snotty handkerchief—right in front of me. It was immediately clear. Pub rock was, [...] "Hello, you bunch of drunks, I'm gonna play these boogies and I hope you like them." [...] The Pistols came out that Tuesday evening and their attitude was, [...] "Here's our tunes, and we couldn't give a flying fuck whether you like them or not. In fact, we're gonna play them even if you fucking hate them."On 30 May, Rhodes and Levene met surreptitiously with Strummer after a 101'ers gig. Strummer was invited to meet up at the band's rehearsal location on Davis Road. After Strummer turned up, Levene grabbed his guitar, stood several inches away from Strummer, {{looked him in the eye}} and then began playing [...] "Keys to Your Heart", one of Strummer's own tunes.|$|E

500|$|With the {{introduction}} of Jason Wilkes and Frost, both considered [...] "outsiders" [...] as Carter {{was in the first}} season, co-showrunner Chris Dingess noted how their arcs in the season would be similar, yet different to Carter's, saying [...] "I think everyone, to get to that place of getting respect, has a different road to get there. Everyone makes different choices along the way that define that road and I think with these three characters, everyone has a distinct, separate path." [...] Atwell spoke specifically about the season's approach to diversity and prejudice, and noted that the series' crew had expanded to include African American and Asian writers as well as a female director. [...] "Since the first season heavily focused on a woman in a man's world," [...] Atwell said, [...] "we're now going into more diversity and we're investigating different prejudices within this time and one of them absolutely would have been race, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> know....if you have a staunchly white male cast then it might be more accurate of the time, but it becomes less relatable to our audiences, especially when the Marvel world's so diverse." [...] On the racism issue, Butters stated, [...] "We didn't want to just have an African-American character and not talk about that. That would have been very inauthentic." [...] As for the sexism Frost faces, Gina McIntrye and Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly saw similarities with Marvel's Jessica Jones when Frost is asked to smile by two different men in her flashbacks in [...] "Smoke & Mirrors". Towers said, [...] "The talent agent [...] may not be the Purple Man, but Whitney is certainly being ushered into a brainwashed mindset that will set her on a path she can't deviate from easily." ...|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy VI {{is often}} {{regarded}} as one of the best titles in the series and one of the best role-playing video games ever created. In 2005, IGN placed Final Fantasy VI 56th on their list of the 100 greatest games, as the second highest ranked Final Fantasy title on the list after Final Fantasy IV. In 2006, Nintendo Power ranked it as the 13th top 200 game on any Nintendo platform, suggesting that it might be the best Final Fantasy ever. That same year, readers of the Japanese magazine Famitsu voted it as the 25th best game of all time. In 2008, Final Fantasy VI took the #1 spot on G4 TV's [...] "Top Must Own RPGs" [...] list. That same year, ScrewAttack named Final Fantasy VI the third best SNES game, beaten only by [...] and Super Metroid. In 2009, Final Fantasy VI was inducted into the IGN Videogame Hall of Fame, becoming the second Final Fantasy game to do so (the only other Final Fantasy to do so was the original Final Fantasy). In 2012, also IGN put Final Fantasy VI as number one on their list of the top role-playing video games, stating: [...] "There are too many moments in Final Fantasy VI worthy of celebration to name them all. Biggs and Wedge leading Terra through the snow. The poisoning of Doma. Sandy boots. The destruction of the world. A tragic opera. Ultros! We hold these close to our hearts, and that's not even including Espers and the most poignant character themes in the series to date. So cheers, Final Fantasy VI. May your name follow us <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> tumble towards the future of art, entertainment, narrative, and everything that keeps us gaming." [...] In an updated version of the [...] "Top 100" [...] list in 2007, IGN ranked Final Fantasy VI as the ninth top game of all time, above all other Final Fantasy games in the series. They continued to cite the game's character development, and especially noted Kefka as [...] "one of the most memorable bad guys in RPG history." [...] In 2009, Game Informer put the SNES version of Final Fantasy III eighth on their list of the top games of all time, opining that it [...] "perfected the 2D role-playing game." [...] It fell from its seventh-place ranking the staff gave it in 2001. In 2012, the staff of GamesRadar ranked it as the ninth best SNES game, stating that [...] "for it to remain so effective and so moving for so long after its 1994 release means it is a true work of art, and demands to sit high atop any list, regardless of platform (we did already name it the 14th best game of all time)." [...] In 2017, the staff of IGN ranked it as the second best RPG game of all time, stating that [...] "This willingness to explore heavy themes and unthinkable outcomes — made all the more poignant when set against dramatic set pieces and a soaring score — is one of the biggest reasons why Squaresoft’s 1994 magnum opus is so very special." ...|$|E
