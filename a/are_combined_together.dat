2500|$|PRSI is paid by employees, employers, and the {{self-employed}} {{as a percentage}} of wages after pension contributions. It includes social insurance and a health contribution.

The health contribution is used to help fund the health services, although paying it does not confer any entitlement to treatment or anything else. For the most part, the two amounts <b>are</b> <b>combined</b> <b>together</b> and stated as one deduction on payslips.

The various arguments for it were answered in every shape; but no way more effectually than by examining what pretence the Presbyterians had to share in all the privileges of government, either from their own principles and behaviour, or compared with those of other sectaries. Under the former head they were fully silenced by our author in 'The Presbyterians' Plea of Merit Impartially Examined'.
