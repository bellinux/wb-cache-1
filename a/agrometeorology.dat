40|$|Extension <b>agrometeorology</b> may {{be defined}} as that <b>agrometeorology</b> that attends to (i) local {{suffering}} from weather and climate and persistent ways to diminish it and (ii) windows of opportunity that (micro) climate offers “on farm”. For both approaches, a combination of local innovations and scientific understanding must be used, in a participatory approach. This should lead {{to the establishment of}} agrometeorological services by and with farmers and means first and foremost field work with farmers. To carry it out, we will have to make use of new educational commitments as “Climate Field Shops”, Climate Field Schools/Classes and Agrometeorological Extension Training. These all ask for institutionalization of scientists listening to farmers and training and working with extension agents. To presently remain on the road to sustainable agriculture, in agricultural and social sciences we should, among others, care for policies of establishing and supporting a rural response to climate change and of institutionalization of that response. In the mentioned new educational commitments we should discuss with farmers the local consequences of climate change.

40|$|Sorghum and millet are {{important}} food crops in the semi-arid tropics, but their yields have remained low and unstable {{because of a}} range of environmental constraints. Increasing and stabilizing their production is thus an important part of ICRISAT's mandate, and we were pleased to sponsor with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) this symposium on the <b>agrometeorology</b> of sorghum and millet. The main objective of the symposium-the fourth in a WMO series on the <b>agrometeorology</b> of single crops-was to encourage the practical use of climatic data to improve production, by assessing the extent and intensity of climatic risks and by studying the response of the crop to its growing environment. In the Sahel region of Africa, for example, such studies may {{play a key role in}} helping farmers adjust age-old cropping practices to meet changes in climate. The symposium brought together 112 participants from 18 countries to review current knowledge of <b>agrometeorology</b> and to plan future research. Besides the scientific papers and discussions, the symposium included a practical workshop on computer techniques, during which participants used ICRISAT computers and operational models to analyze data from their own countries.

In addition, the borders between meteorological forecasts for agriculture and agrometeorological forecasts are not always clear. Examples include the use of weather forecasts for farm operations such as spraying pesticides or deciding on trafficability in relation to adverse weather. Many forecast issues by various national institutions (weather, but also commodity prices or flood warnings) are vital to the farming community, but they do not constitute agrometeorological forecasts.

It then reviews the options that LEISA farmers have in risk management of agrometeorological and agroclimatological calamities. This is based on the role that the pertinent meteorological/climatological parameters and phenomena play as limiting factors in agricultural production and the expectations on their variability. Subsequently, local case studies are given as examples of preparedness strategies to cope with i). variable water/moisture flows, including mechanical impacts of rain and/or hail, ii). variable temperature and heat flows, including fires, and iii). fitting cropping periods to the varying seasons, everywhere including related phenomena as appropriate. The paper ends with a series of important additional considerations without which the indicated strategies cannot be successful on a larger scale and in the long run...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The first {{necessary}} {{change for}} <b>agrometeorology,</b> in generally lower (external) input parts of agriculture in developing countries, is {{on research and}} extension. They have to refocus to preparedness for risks and uncertainties of local farming systems in need of support in four defined directions of prioritization, emphasis depending on the farming system concerned. These are (i) extreme events and their consequences caused by meteorological and climatological disasters on all time scales, including related aversion attempts; (ii) pests and diseases, including countervailing measures; (iii) trying to use beneficial climate and weather and (iv) applications of agrometeorological services. The second necessary change for such <b>agrometeorology</b> is participation of farmers {{in the establishment of}} agrometeorological services with well trained intermediaries in such undertakings as Climate Field Schools. The third necessary change is that agrometeorological services should be developed {{in such a way as}} to increase the resilience of farmers, in line with further and wider developments to be stimulated in rural areas. The most important and most insecure factors, however, will have to do with the socio-political allies to be supported to create- and keep everywhere- on a large scale the enabling environment. To sole cropping work, to which most response farming advisories were dedicated, if any, multiple cropping agrometeorological services have to be added. They should ideally belong to a new service environment in rural areas in progressing countries...|$|E

40|$|The climatic and {{environmental}} resource base of crops plays a dominant {{role in their}} survival, growth, and development. Therefore, weather and climate, crops, {{other parts of the}} resource base, and crop/weather and crop/climate relations need the continuous attention of applied research. This helps not only to protect the resource base and sustain {{the quality and quantity of}} crop yields, but it also is a basis for the farmers ’ income. However, to make sense, the products of science as well as forecasts and advisories must increasingly be made available to assist the farmers, through operational agrometeorological services, which range from agroclimatological characterization to management of natural resources. To explain the actual scarcity of agrometeorological services, particularly in developing countries, Stigter developed a diagnostic and conceptual framework that pictures the generation and transfer of agrometeorological information from the existing support systems to its adaptation, dispersion, and teaching at the farm level. This framework lessens the confusion between the goals and means in generating agrometeorological services. Diagnosis of current <b>agrometeorology</b> practices shows a need for <b>agrometeorology</b> to arrive at on-farm agrometeorological services. This is illustrated with ample examples from an earlier defined list of such services. It is concluded that agrometeorological in-service education of extension intermediaries is essential to train farmers in field classes, improve their income, and protect the agricultural production environment from degradation. This ultimately materializes in down to earth and to the point agrometeorological services in well-defined farming systems...|$|E

40|$|Professor Stigter what in {{your view}} {{have been the most}} {{significant}} contributions that ICTs have made to the study and practice of <b>agrometeorology?</b> In <b>agrometeorology,</b> as in any other environmental science, modern ICTs have contributed to new and better knowledge and applications. Examples can be found in weather, climate and yield forecasting, risk assessments, monitoring and early warning systems. Governments are now {{in a better position to}} warn farmers to enable them to prepare for calamities, and to reduce and mitigate the impacts of natural disasters on agricultural production to the best of their abilities. Better meteorological services are directly serving farmers in developed countries and, to a lesser but increasing extent, better off farmers in developing countries. What are {{in your view}} the most urgent agricultural problems facing farmers in ACP countries? The majority of poor and marginal farmers are confronted with a number of urgent problems. They have to farm under conditions of increasing climate variability and change, and degrading soils. This applies to the users of grasslands and forage crops for livestock in Inner Mongolia, where I am working right now, and to dryland and irrigated farming in central Sudan, where I worked for 15 years. It also applies to small rice farmers in Indonesia as well as to the millet growers in northern Nigeria, where I worked for ten years on intercropping and on agroforestry systems to protect crops from dry winds. Many of these farmers also face markets that are biased against them, and governments that are unwilling or unable to assist. And when they do receive assistance, the measures are often too limited in scope, or are incompatible with their actual needs. They are also usually devised from the top down, addressing the symptoms, rather than tackling actual problems from the bottom up. Do you believe that research in <b>agrometeorology</b> can help to overcome some of these problems? In my view, making agricultural meteorology more operational is not enough to help poor farmers. To provide effective agrometeorological services, we have to combine the adaptive strategies they have developed themselves using indigenous innovations and experience absorbed from elsewhere, with other sources of knowledge. These sources include contemporary scientific knowledge, as well as the understanding of socio-economic systems necessary to create appropriate policy environments. In the application of scientific knowledge, ICTs are among the most powerful supportive components. But agrometeorological services have to be communicated to farmers in a participatory approach. Can you give some examples of agrometeorological interventions in which ICTs and indigenous knowledge have been combined with some measure of success? I am afraid I have yet to see clear examples. When I was president of the Commission for Agricultural Meteorology (CAgM) of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) in the 1990 s, we tried to collect examples world-wide, but found few successful cases involving poor or marginal farmers. To a certain extent, this may be due to the lack of documentation, limited access to the ´grey´ literature (such as unpublished theses), language barriers or other constraints. That is why we are now trying again to collect such information. In China, for example, we are currently setting up a project in which we will try to identify examples of successful agrometeorological services. This may teach us about ICT components as well. Given the rapid technological advances in <b>agrometeorology,</b> is there a widening knowledge gap between providers and end users? This knowledge gap is very real and only strong policies towards agrometeorological services can overcome it. I strongly believe that providing such training for the staff of intermediary organizations - including local weather services and extension services - can help to bridge the gap. How have ICTs contributed to your own work? I am an experimental physicist by training, and all physics-related ICTs have always fascinated me. In our African research projects we have made ample use of ICTs in order to better understand traditional technologies and other forms of local knowledge. Yet, I believe that we have to be vigilant that technology never becomes a goal in itself. ICTs can be extremely useful tools and we must make maximum use of them, but when it comes to the provision of agricultural services to poor and marginal producers, indigenous technologies and local innovations must be our starting point because they represent the existing limitations best. mailto:cjstigter@usa. net Kees Stigter is an agrometeorologist, specialised in dryland agrometeorology; agroforestry against desertification, and traditional techniques of microclimate improvement, particularly in Africa and Asia.
