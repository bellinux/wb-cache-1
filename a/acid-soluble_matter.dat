50|$|The lignin content can {{be defined}} as the sum of the amount of acid-insoluble matter and <b>acid-soluble</b> <b>matter,</b> {{absorbing}} at 205 nm, after sulphuric acid hydrolysis during specified conditions, as determined by gravimetry and spectrophotometry, in milligrams per gram. In the determination, the samples are hydrolyzed with sulphuric acid using a two-step technique. The amount of lignin is determined using gravimetry and spectrophotometry.|$|E
30|$|Gas is {{the most}} {{important}} resource in the PLP marine strata (Wang and Han 2011; Wang et al. 2013 a) and has many types of hydrocarbon sources (Zhao et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2012 a). Three major types of hydrocarbon sources exist: insoluble, soluble, and <b>acid-soluble</b> organic <b>matter.</b> Some insoluble hydrocarbon sources are aggregated (such as coal and oil shale) and others are dissipated (such as different types of kerogens). The soluble hydrocarbon sources include aggregated, dissipated, and transformed soluble organic matter; aggregated soluble organic matter is the oil reservoir formed in the early stage (paleo-oil reservoirs), dissipated soluble organic matter refers to chloroform asphalt “A” inside the source rocks and soluble organic matter migrated outside them (such as bitumen in migration paths or hydrocarbons without reservoir-forming), and transformed soluble organic matter comprises varieties of evolved or oxidized bitumen. <b>Acid-soluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> indicates that the hydrocarbon source existed as organic acid salts in the geological body (Liu et al. 2012 a).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Titanium-bearing {{blast furnace}} slag in which TiO 2 content reaches to 20 %~ 23 % {{is a kind of}} {{precious}} secondary resource. The research utilizes the stable characteristic of TiO 2 in hydrochloric acid to digest <b>acid-soluble</b> <b>matters</b> in slag. Titanium-bearing slag is obtained after solid-liquid separation process. The optimum acidolysis reaction condition can be known through analysis of raw material granularity, acid-slag ratio, reaction temperature and effect caused by reaction time on TiO 2 content in slag. XRD image analysis can prove that the chemical compounds of Al, Mg, Fe are totally acid-thinned and TiO 2 content in slag reaches to above 40 %. This technology provides a valuable new way for the comprehensive utilization of titanium-bearing Slag. The reserve of vanadium titano-magnetite ore in Panzhihua and Xi chang region reaches to 5. 7 billion tons with 8. 7 hundred million tons of associated TiO 2 resource which accounts for 35. 02 % of titanium reserve of the world and 90. 54 % of titanium reserve of china. In the process of vanadium titano-magnetite recycling, half of the associated TiO 2 resource exists in magnetic tailings and can be partly recycled through flotation technology. The other half of the associated TiO 2 resource exists in iron ore concentrate, mixed in {{blast furnace slag}} after furnace process, and then is discharged as waste slag. Furnace slag with TiO 2 content reaching to 20 %~ 23 % is precious Titanium-bearing secondar...|$|R
40|$|The {{suitability}} of mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) {{to follow the}} evolution throughout ripening of specific physicochemical parameters in Camembert-type cheeses was evaluated. The infrared spectra were obtained directly from raw cheese samples deposited on an attenuated total reflectance crystal. Significant correlations were observed between physicochemical data, pH, acid-soluble nitrogen, nonprotein nitrogen, ammonia (NH 4 +), lactose, and lactic acid. Dry matter showed significant correlation only with lactose and nonprotein nitrogen. Principal components analysis factorial maps of physicochemical data showed a ripening evolution in 2 steps, from d 1 to d 7 and from d 8 to d 27, similar to that observed previously from infrared spectral data. Partial least squares regressions {{made it possible to}} obtain good prediction models for dry <b>matter,</b> <b>acid-soluble</b> nitrogen, nonprotein nitrogen, lactose, lactic acid, and NH 4 + values from spectral data of raw cheese. The values of 3 statistical parameters (coefficient of determination, root mean square error of cross validation, and ratio prediction deviation) are satisfactory. Less precise models were obtained for pH...|$|R
