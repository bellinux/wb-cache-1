5|$|In {{computational}} geometry, the duality between Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations {{implies that}} any algorithm for constructing a Voronoi diagram can be immediately converted into an algorithm for the Delaunay triangulation, and vice versa. The same duality {{can also be}} used in finite element mesh generation. Lloyd's algorithm, a method based on Voronoi diagrams for moving a set of points on a surface to more evenly spaced positions, is commonly used as a way to smooth a finite element mesh described by the dual Delaunay triangulation. This method improves the mesh by making its triangles more uniformly sized <b>and</b> <b>shaped.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} {{geometric}} approach for formation control that explicitly decouples translation dynamics from the orientation <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> dynamics.

We derive a class of cooperative control laws <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> consensus algorithms with provable convergence.

5|$|City {{planning}} and urban lifestyles had {{been influenced by}} the Greeks from an early period, and in the eastern Empire, Roman rule accelerated <b>and</b> <b>shaped</b> the local development of cities that already had a strong Hellenistic character. Cities such as Athens, Aphrodisias, Ephesus and Gerasa altered some aspects of city {{planning and}} architecture to conform to imperial ideals, while also expressing their individual identity and regional preeminence. In the areas of the western Empire inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, Rome encouraged the development of urban centres with stone temples, forums, monumental fountains, and amphitheatres, often on or near the sites of the preexisting walled settlements known as oppida. Urbanization in Roman Africa expanded on Greek and Punic cities along the coast.|$|E

A graduate of the University of Birmingham and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Smith worked for many years as a research metallurgist at the American Brass Company. During World War II he worked in the Chemical-Metallurgical Division of the Los Alamos Laboratory, where he purified, cast <b>and</b> <b>shaped</b> uranium-235 and plutonium, a metal hitherto available only in microgram amounts, and whose properties were largely unknown. After the war he served on the Atomic Energy Commission's influential General Advisory Committee, and the President's Science Advisory Committee.|$|E

5|$|Shells {{are used}} decoratively in many ways.

Shells have had various uses in the past as body decorations, utensils, scrapers and cutting implements. Carefully cut <b>and</b> <b>shaped</b> shell tools dating back 32,000 years have been found in a cave in Indonesia. In this region, shell technology may have been developed in preference to the use of stone or bone implements, perhaps because of the scarcity of suitable rock materials.|$|E
5|$|Pastor H.J. Pedersen, {{like most}} early pastors in the synod, had {{received}} his training in a folk school, {{and he was}} convinced that the success of the new congregation and colony depended on the establishment of such a Danish-speaking folk school. Danebod Folk School opened December1, 1888, with Pedersen as president. Other teachers were Carl Hansen and Christian Hansen. Among the first students were Niels Petersen and Kristian Klink, both Danish immigrants. Klink was a stonemason educated in Denmark, and he helped pastor Pedersen in building the Stone Hall. It was built of native rock. Farmers hauled rocks from the shores of Swan Lake just south of Danebod, and Klink and his helpers split <b>and</b> <b>shaped</b> the rocks. The Stone Hall was finished in the fall of 1889, and the first public gathering in the Stone Hall was at Klink's funeral in November 1889. The Stone Hall quickly became the center of the new colony, and Sunday services were conducted here, as well as numerous weddings, baptisms and funerals. The students at the Danebod Folk School used the building as a gym hall, and young people would meet here to socialize, meet up with friends, and participate in singing games. Three years later, the Stone Hall was now too small for worship services. It was decided to build a new church, and the Cross Church at Danebod was dedicated on Sunday, June16, 1895.|$|E

Such tubes rarely exceed 40°C (104°F) even under the most severe of operating conditions in a room at ambient temperature. Vacuum fluorescent displays from the same era use completely different technology—they have a heated cathode together with a control grid <b>and</b> <b>shaped</b> phosphor anodes; Nixies have no heater or control grid, typically a single anode (in the form of a wire mesh, {{not to be confused with}} a control grid), <b>and</b> <b>shaped</b> bare metal cathodes.|$|E

Shaping, on the other hand, can absorb short bursts of packet, where the burst size {{is determined by the}} allocated buffer. When the buffer is full, all incoming packets are immediately dropped <b>and</b> traffic <b>shaping</b> effectively acts as traffic policing.

40|$|Tracking <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> {{estimation}} of flexible robots that navigate through the human anatomy are prerequisites to safe intracorporeal control. Despite extensive research in kinematic and dynamic modelling, inaccuracies <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> deformation of the robot due to unknown loads and collisions with the anatomy make shape sensing important for intra-operative navigation. To address this issue, vision-based solutions have been explored. The task of 2 D tracking <b>and</b> 3 D <b>shape</b> reconstruction of flexible robots as they reach deep-seated anatomical locations is challenging, since the image acquisition techniques usually suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or slow temporal responses. Moreover, tracking <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> estimation are thus far treated independently despite their coupled relationship. This paper aims to address tracking <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> estimation in a unified framework based on Markov Random Fields (MRF). By using concentric tube robots as an example, the proposed algorithm fuses information extracted from standard monoplane X-ray fluoroscopy with the kinematics model to achieve joint 2 D tracking <b>and</b> 3 D <b>shape</b> estimation in realistic clinical scenarios. Detailed performance {{analyses of the}} results demonstrate {{the accuracy of the}} method for both tracking <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> reconstruction...|$|R
