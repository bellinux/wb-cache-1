25|$|The ISM is also {{responsible}} for extinction and reddening, the decreasing light intensity and shift in the dominant observable wavelengths of light from a star. These effects are caused by scattering and absorption of photons and allow the ISM to be observed {{with the naked eye}} in <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>sky.</b> The apparent rifts that {{can be seen in the}} band of the Milky Way – a uniform disk of stars – are caused by absorption of background starlight by molecular clouds within a few thousand light years from Earth.|$|E

25|$|The {{conventional}} color descriptions {{are traditional}} in astronomy, and represent colors {{relative to the}} mean color of an A-class star, which {{is considered to be}} white. The apparent color descriptions are what the observer would see if trying to describe the stars under <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>sky</b> without aid to the eye, or with binoculars. However, most stars in the sky, except the brightest ones, appear white or bluish white to the unaided eye because they are too dim for color vision to work. Red supergiants are cooler and redder than dwarfs of the same spectral type, and stars with particular spectral features such as carbon stars may be far redder than any black body.|$|E
25|$|Most auroras {{occur in}} a band known as the auroral zone, which is {{typically}} 3° to 6° wide in latitude and between 10° and 20° from the geomagnetic poles at all local times (or longitudes), most clearly seen at night against <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>sky.</b> A region that currently displays an aurora is called the auroral oval, a band displaced towards the nightside of the Earth. Early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations. Elias Loomis (1860), and later Hermann Fritz (1881) and S. Tromholt (1882) in more detail, established that the aurora appeared mainly in the auroral zone. Day-to-day positions of the auroral ovals are posted on the internet.|$|E
500|$|Hale said [...] "there is {{an entire}} {{generation}} that has come of age having never really seen the dark sky", so {{part of what he}} wanted to accomplish with Earthrise was [...] "to create an environment where students could spend some nights out under <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>sky</b> and see what it really looks like." ...|$|E

500|$|The Nassau Station, {{originally}} {{constructed in}} the 1950s, currently houses a 36-inch reflecting telescope. It is named after observatory director Jason John Nassau, who was a prominent astronomer at the time. [...] Work {{was carried out in}} the 1990s to make the telescope capable of remote viewing, {{making it one of the}} first telescopes to be used in this manner. However, it was seldom used by Case astronomers due to increased light pollution from Cleveland and the enhanced capabilities of the Burrell Schmidt. As a result, the observatory was left unused for several years until 2008, when it was sold to the Geauga Park District. The park district reopened the facility as part of its Observatory Park on June 16, 2012. The park was designated as <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>sky</b> park by the International Dark Sky Association.|$|E
2500|$|The Dumbbell Nebula (M27), is a large, bright {{planetary}} nebula which {{was discovered by}} the French astronomer Charles Messier in 1764 as the very first object of its kind. It can be seen with good binoculars in <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>sky</b> location, appearing as a dimly glowing disk approximately 6 arcminutes in diameter. A telescope reveals its double-lobed shape, {{similar to that of}} an hourglass. Brocchi's Cluster (Collinder 399) is an asterism formerly thought to be an open cluster. It is also called [...] "the Coathanger" [...] because of its distinctive star pattern when viewed with binoculars or a low power telescope.|$|E
2500|$|Mandelbrot {{also put}} his ideas {{to work in}} cosmology. He offered in 1974 a new {{explanation}} of Olbers' paradox (the [...] "dark night sky" [...] riddle), demonstrating the consequences of fractal theory as a sufficient, but not necessary, resolution of the paradox. He postulated that if {{the stars in the}} universe were fractally distributed (for example, like Cantor dust), it would not be necessary to rely on the Big Bang theory to explain the paradox. His model would not rule out a Big Bang, but would allow for <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>sky</b> even if the Big Bang had not occurred.|$|E

2500|$|Smart {{is one of}} Australia's {{best known}} artists with his almost iconic and unique imagery, heavily {{influenced}} by various artists and art forms. His stark portrayals of contemporary life, both realistic and absurd, have been the basis of many artistic discussions. Critics and admirers of Smart's paintings often debate his subject matter but in interviews Smart has preferred not to discuss his style; [...] "Leaving the interpretation as the prerogative of the individual viewer." [...] Smart states that he [...] "paints a picture because he likes the shape", and when asked why his skies are always so gloomy and smog-laden or why his faces never wear a smile, he claims [...] "I need <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>sky</b> for the composition, because pale blue {{at the top of}} a frame looks nothing... because a smiling face is too hard to paint".|$|E
2500|$|Astronomy is very {{sensitive}} to light pollution. The night sky viewed from a city bears no resemblance to what {{can be seen from}} dark skies. Skyglow (the scattering of light in the atmosphere) reduces the contrast between stars and galaxies and the sky itself, making it much harder to see fainter objects. This is one factor that has caused newer telescopes to be built in increasingly remote areas. Some astronomers use narrow-band [...] "nebula filters" [...] which only allow specific wavelengths of light commonly seen in nebulae, or broad-band [...] "light pollution filters" [...] which are designed to reduce (but not eliminate) the effects of light pollution by filtering out spectral lines commonly emitted by sodium- and mercury-vapor lamps, thus enhancing contrast and improving the view of dim objects such as galaxies and nebulae. Unfortunately these light pollution reduction (LPR) filters are not a cure for light pollution. LPR filters reduce the brightness of the object under study and this limits the use of higher magnifications. LPR filters work by blocking light of certain wavelengths, which alters the color of the object, often creating a pronounced green cast. Furthermore, LPR filters only work on certain object types (mainly emission nebulae) and are of little use on galaxies and stars. No filter can match the effectiveness of <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>sky</b> for visual or photographic purposes. Due to their low surface brightness, the visibility of diffuse sky objects such as nebulae and galaxies is affected by light pollution more than are stars. Most such objects are rendered invisible in heavily light polluted skies around major cities. A simple method for estimating the darkness of a location is to look for the Milky Way, which from truly dark skies appears bright enough to cast a shadow.|$|E

Peel Head {{has been used as}} a vantage point for viewing the Northern Lights when conditions are favourable, as it has a clear and elevated view to the Northern horizon. Peel is well known for sunsets over the sea (hence its moniker [...] "Sunset City"): sometimes these outline the Mountains of Mourne in Ireland, directly to the west of Peel.|$|R
60|$|The sky and sea are parting like {{an oyster}} shell, {{with a low}} red gape. Looking across from the veranda at it, one shivers. Not that it is cold. The morning {{is not at all}} cold. But the ominousness of it: that long red slit between <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>sky</b> and a dark Ionian sea, terrible old bivalve which has held life between its lips so long. And here, at this house, we are ledged so awfully above the dawn, naked to it.|$|E
60|$|The part of {{the village}} in which I resided was a grove of cocoa-nut trees, and at night, when the dead leaves were {{sometimes}} collected together and burnt, the effect was most magnificent--the tall stems, the fine crowns of foliage, and the immense fruit-clusters, being brilliantly illuminated against <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>sky,</b> and appearing like a fairy palace supported on a hundred columns, and groined over with leafy arches. The cocoa-nut tree, when well grown, is certainly the prince of palms both for beauty and utility.|$|E
