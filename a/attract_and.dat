Several dozen small employers in the state have also said that same-sex marriage will be good for their businesses, helping to <b>attract</b> <b>and</b> retain talent.|$|E

Her mantra associates her with syllables denoting beauty, light, fire, spiritual self-realization, and destruction of delusion. The Shakta Pramoda and the Rudrayamala recommend the use of her mantra to obtain wealth and auspiciousness.|$|E

South Dakota's history and rural character still strongly influence the state's culture.|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the <b>attracting</b> <b>and</b> quasi-invariant sets for a class of {{impulsive}} stochastic partial functional differential equations with infinite delays. By establishing new impulsive-integral inequalities, we obtain the <b>attracting</b> <b>and</b> quasi-invariant sets of systems under consideration. We should point out that the stationary solution and the periodic solution are very much related to <b>attracting</b> <b>and</b> quasi-invariant sets [21]. In our next paper, we will explore the relationship between <b>attracting</b> <b>and</b> quasi-invariant sets and the stationary solution or the periodic solution of (1).|$|R

5|$|Another pitfall trap form {{unrelated}} to the Sarraceniaceae family are the urns of bromeliad leaves that are formed when leaves are tightly packed together in a rosette, collecting water and trapping insects. Unlike Brocchinia reducta, which has been proven to produce at least one digestive enzyme and can therefore be considered carnivorous, the epiphytic Catopsis berteroniana has little evidence supporting the claims that it is carnivorous. It is able to <b>attract</b> <b>and</b> kill prey and the trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves can absorb nutrients, but so far no enzyme activity has been detected. It may be that this plant also relies on an internal food web for soft tissue digestion. The same could be said for Paepalanthus bromelioides, though it is a member of Eriocaulaceae and not a bromeliad. It also forms a central water reservoir that has adaptations to attract insects. It, like C. berteroniana, produces no digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Parades {{are held}} {{for a range}} of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are {{designed}} to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. Cavalcades and the modern variant, the motorcade, are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades <b>attract</b> <b>and</b> entertain people who watch them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the Trooping the Colour in 5) and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.|$|E
5|$|Sundews are characterised by the glandular tentacles, {{topped with}} sticky secretions, that cover their laminae. The {{trapping}} and digestion mechanism usually employs {{two types of}} glands: stalked glands that secrete sweet mucilage to <b>attract</b> <b>and</b> ensnare insects and enzymes to digest them, and sessile glands that absorb the resulting nutrient soup (the latter glands are missing in some species, such as D.erythrorhiza). Small prey, mainly consisting of insects, are attracted by the sweet secretions of the peduncular glands. Upon touching these, the prey become entrapped by sticky mucilage which prevents their progress or escape. Eventually, the prey either succumb to death through exhaustion or through asphyxiation as the mucilage envelops them and clogs their spiracles. Death usually occurs within 15 minutes. The plant meanwhile secretes esterase, peroxidase, phosphatase and protease enzymes. These enzymes dissolve the insect and free the nutrients contained within it. This nutrient mixture is then absorbed through the leaf surfaces {{to be used by}} the rest of the plant.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} go-ahead {{was given}} at 14:00. At 15:30, some 58–80 Ju 88s from I., II., and III./LG 1, escorted by 30 Bf 110s of V./LG 1, took off to bomb Boscombe Down and Worthy Down. RAF Andover {{was to be}} bombed as well, {{with the support of}} 52 Ju 87s from StG 1 and StG 2 who were to strike at RAF Warmwell and Yeovil. I./JG 53 flew a fighter sweep ahead of the bombers from Poole to Lyme Regis in order to tempt the RAF into battle. I./JG 53 made landfall at 16:00. The sweep failed to <b>attract</b> <b>and</b> divert RAF squadrons. Instead, all it succeeded in doing was to alert the RAF defences a critical five minutes earlier. When the main wave of LG 1 and StG 2 arrived over the coast, they were greeted by 77 RAF fighters.|$|E
5|$|Turahan {{also took}} several {{measures}} {{to restore order}} and prosperity in his province, most notably the foundation (or re-foundation) {{of the town of}} Tyrnavos, which before was a small pastoral settlement. To <b>attract</b> <b>and</b> protect the local Greek Orthodox population, he granted it special privileges, such as special administrative status as a waqf (a religious endowment) of the Sharif of Mecca, tax exemptions and the prohibition of Ottoman troops from passing through the town. He also endowed it with both a mosque (destroyed after the Greek annexation of Thessaly in 1881) and a church, St Nicholas Turahan, which survives to this day. Turahan also endowed many other public buildings such as mosques, monasteries, madrasas, schools, caravanserais, bridges and baths across the province. He also took care to maintain and foster the Thessalian cotton, silk and wool textile industry, to the extent that later generations attributed to him the introduction of new dye techniques based on yellow berries, madder and the kali plant, used in the manufacture of potash. From there these materials spread to the rest of Rumelia and thence to Western Europe.|$|E
