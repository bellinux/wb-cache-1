40|$|Rationale: Subjective craving, which {{contributes}} to the continuation of drug use in <b>active</b> <b>abuser</b> and the occurrence of relapse in detoxified abusers, {{is considered to be}} a central phenomenon in addiction. Dopamine pathway has been implicated in the mechanism underlying the cue-elicited craving for a variety of addictive substances. Objectives: The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that heroin addicts carrying D 4 dopamine receptor gene (DRD 4) variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) long type allele would have higher craving after exposure to a heroin-related cue. Materials and methods: Craving was induced by a series of exposure to neutral and heroin-related cue and were assessed in a cohort of Chinese heroin abusers (n = 420) recruited from the Voluntary Drug Dependence Treatment Center at Shanghai. Results: Significantly stronger cue-elicited heroin craving was found in individuals carrying DRD 4 VNTR long type allele than the non-carriers (F = 31. 040, p < 0. 001). As for baseline craving and mean change in craving responding to neutral stimuli, no significance was found (1. 06 +/- 0. 34 vs 1. 07 +/- 0. 36, F = 0. 067, p = 0. 797 and 0. 42 +/- 0. 34 vs 0. 45 +/- 0. 37, F = 0. 277, p = 0. 599, respectively). Conclusions: The results of our study suggest that DRD 4 VNTR polymorphism {{contributes to}} cue-elicited craving in heroin dependence, indicating DRD 4 VNTR represents one of potential genetic risk factors for cue-induced craving...|$|E

40|$|Although {{child abuse}} {{has existed for}} centuries in the United States, an {{increase}} in the number of reported incidents in recent years has spurred legislative and judicial response, primarily in the form of 2 ̆ 2 failure-to protect 2 ̆ 2 laws. 2 Failure-to-protect laws impose liability upon parents, who have a duty to protect their child, when they fail to prevent abuse of the child at the hands of a known offender. 3 Child abuse statutes generally appear in two forms: commission statutes, 4 which are used to convict those who actually inflict abuse (<b>active</b> <b>abusers),</b> and omission statutes,S which criminalize the passive conduct of those who expose a child to a risk of maltreatment or fail to protect or care for a child when they have an affirmative duty to do so (passive perpetrators). 6 A court 2 ̆ 7 s inquiry when applying an omission statute focuses on whether the passive perpetrator had notice of ongoing abuse and allowed the abuse to continue. A passive perpetrator 2 ̆ 7 s liability for child abuse or homicide, if the abuse is the direct cause of the child 2 ̆ 7 s death, is predicated upon a finding of several factors: (1) a legal duty to protect the child; 7 (2) actual or constructive notice of the foreseeability of abuse; (3) the child 2 ̆ 7 s exposure to abuse; and (4) failure to prevent such abuse. Parents can fulfill their legal duty to protect their children in the face of abuse by reporting the abuse to authorities, removing the child from the abusive situation, or ejecting the abuser from the child 2 ̆ 7 s home. Statutes which criminalize passive conduct aim to protect children 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 best interests 2 ̆ 2 by compelling parents to remove their children from abusive environments...|$|R
40|$|In all, 87 child abusers were {{classified}} as belonging {{to one of the}} four pathway groups identified by Ward and Hudson’s self-regulation model of the sexual offense process. This model distin-guishes between offenders who have approach or avoidant goals and between their use of active or passive strategies. Results demonstrated that themodel reliably identified abusers. Approach, compared to avoidant, goal abusers reported significantly higher levels of cognitive distortions, emotional congruence, and distortions {{about the impact of the}} abuse on their victims. They were also generally found to be extrafamilial, or extrafamilial plus intrafamilial, offenders and to have boy or both sex victims. Avoidant goal abusers were generally found to be in a long-term relationship at the time of the offense, to have children, and to have offended against girls. Pas-sive, compared to <b>active</b> strategy, <b>abusers</b> were more likely to blame external circumstances for their offending and have previous convictions for sexual offenses...|$|R
40|$|A {{long-term}} prospective controlled {{study of}} analgesic abuse in Belgium. In 1991, Dubach et al clearly demonstrated {{an increased risk}} of renal morbidity and mortality after phenacetin abuse in middle aged working women. We investigated the renal effects of the abuse of several kinds of analgesics in abusers of different sex and age categories. A cohort of 200 <b>active</b> analgesic <b>abusers</b> (age range 21 to 86 years) and 200 matched controls was followed for seven years (1984 to 1992). Subjects were visited at home once a year for a short interview and a medical examination. Renal function showed a significant decrease over time in controls as well as in abusers (P < 0. 001). The decrease was, however, significantly more pronounced in abusers (P < 0. 001). The development of a decreased renal function was observed in 12 abusers and 2 controls resulting in a relative risk of 6. 1 (95 % CI: 1. 4 to 25. 9). Subjects showing a decreased renal function underwent a diagnostic investigation. Using validated diagnostic criteria, analgesic nephropathy could be established in 6 out of the 10 abusers who had a diagnostic workup, {{in the absence of any}} other form of renal disease...|$|R
40|$|<b>Active</b> cocaine <b>abusers</b> have {{a diminished}} neural {{response}} to errors, {{particularly in the}} anterior cingulate cortex thought critical to error processing. The inability to detect, or adjust performance following errors {{has been linked to}} clinical symptoms including the loss of insight and perseverative behavior. We investigated the cognitive implications of this diminished error-related activity, using response inhibition tasks that required error awareness and performance adaptation. Twenty-one active cocaine users (six female subjects, mean age 40. 3) and 22 non-drug using adults (six female subjects, mean 39. 9) participated. The results indicated that cocaine users consistently demonstrated poorer inhibitory control, a deficit accompanied by reduced awareness of errors. Adaptation of post-error reaction times did not differ between groups, although a different measure of adaptive behavior: exerting inhibitory control on the trial immediately after failing to inhibit, was significantly poorer in the cocaine using sample. In summary, cocaine users demonstrated a diminished capacity for monitoring their behavior, but were able to perform post-error adjustment to processes not already suffering an underlying deficit. These difficulties are consistent with previous reports of cocaine-related hypoactivity in the neural system underlying cognitive control, and highlight the potential for cognitive dysfunction to manifest as behavioral deficits that likely contribute to the maintenance of drug dependence...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the possible effect of opiates on blood rheology, the plasma fibrinogen, prothrombin time and leukocyte aggregation were measured in 75 heroin addicts categorized {{by the time}} of abstention from heroin and the administration of naltrexone (25 <b>active</b> heroin <b>abusers,</b> 25 abstaining for 1 week, 11 abstaining for at least 5 months and 14 abstaining for 1 month and taking naltrexone during this period). No difference was detected in prothrombin time, but the leukocyte aggregation and fibrinogen were significantly different among the four groups (p = 0. 028 and p = 0. 0001, respectively). In particular, fibrinogen was 318 +/- 10. 9 mg/dL in heroin abusers, significantly higher than that of the remaining three groups; the percentage of aggregated leukocytes was 5. 01 +/- 0. 77 in heroin users, significantly higher than that of subjects abstaining for at least 5 months. The fibrinogen levels declined sharply with abstention and an additive effect was noted with the administration of naltrexone, but leukocyte aggregation changed more slowly, and the effect of naltrexone (if any) was weaker. These data indicate an adverse effect of opiates on blood rheology and suggest that further studies should be performed to evaluate whether naltrexone may be useful in the prevention of major ischemic syndromes in patients with hyperfibrinogenemia and, perhaps, in those with high levels of leukocyte aggregation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Gender {{differences}} in vulnerability for cocaine addiction have been reported. Though the mechanisms are not understood, here we hypothesize that gender {{differences in}} reactivity to conditioned-cues, which contributes to relapse, are involved. Method: To test this we compared brain metabolism (using PET and 18 FDG) between female (n = 10) and male (n = 16) <b>active</b> cocaine <b>abusers</b> when they watched a neutral video (nature scenes) versus a cocaine-cues video. Results: Self-reports of craving increased with the cocaine-cue video but responses did not differ between genders. In contrast, changes in whole brain metabolism with cocaine-cues differed by gender (p, 0. 05); females significantly decreased metabolism (28. 6 % 610) whereas males tended to increase it (+ 5. 5 % 618). SPM analysis (Cocaine-cues vs Neutral) in females revealed decreases in frontal, cingulate and parietal cortices, thalamus and midbrain (p, 0. 001) whereas males showed increases in right inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44 / 45) (only at p, 0. 005). The gender-cue interaction showed greater decrements with Cocaine-cues in females than males (p, 0. 001) in frontal (BA 8, 9, 10), anterior cingulate (BA 24, 32), posterior cingulate (BA 23, 31), inferior parietal (BA 40) and thalamus (dorsomedial nucleus). Conclusions: Females showed greater brain reactivity to cocaine-cues than males but no differences in craving, suggesting {{that there may be}} {{gender differences in}} response to cues that are not linked with craving but could affect subsequent dru...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To {{examine the}} {{evidence}} for excluding chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients with substance abuse from treatment with interferon (IFN) and ribavirin. METHODS: We reviewed clinical trials focussing on the treatment of chronic hepatitis C of patients with substance abuse between 2001 and 2004. Ten clinical trials concerning antiviral treatment in substance abusers were described of which six were controlled ones. There were no randomised trials. There was one controlled multi-centre trial. One trial used pegylated IFN. RESULTS: In the total group of substance abusers the sustained viral response (SVR) and the adherence was not different from control groups. In former drug users, active drug users and patients taking substitution therapy for opioid dependence the sustained viral response and adherence was not different from control populations. However, non-substituted active drug users seemed {{more likely to be}} lost to follow-up. Discontinuation of treatment occurred most frequently during the first 8 weeks of therapy. Neurobehavioural changes leading to depression started in the first 8 weeks of treatment. Although follow-up periods after SVR were short, the currently described re-infection rate occurring in active intravenous drug users remains low. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence to withhold antiviral treatment against HCV in <b>active</b> substance <b>abusers.</b> It seems important to advise to start substitution therapy in non-substituted active drug users, increase substitution therapy dose in substituted patients and treat depression as early as possible. More prospective controlled trials on HCV treatment in active and difficult-to-reach substance users are needed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Alcohol use {{disorders}} affect {{millions of}} individuals worldwide. Alcohol consumption is directly associated with liver disease mortality and accounts for elevated {{social and economic}} costs. Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) may {{take the form of}} acute involvement (alcoholic hepatitis) or chronic liver disease (steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis). The severity and prognosis of alcohol-induced liver disease depends on the amount, pattern and duration of alcohol consumption, {{as well as on the}} presence of liver inflammation, diet, nutritional status and genetic predisposition of an individual. While steatosis is an almost completely benign disease, liver cirrhosis is associated with marked morbidity, mortality and life expectancy shortening. The median survival of patients with advanced cirrhosis is 1 - 2 years. Severe acute alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is associated with mortality as high as 50 %. It has been managed with corticoids, pentoxifylline and enteral nutrition, although evidence based data are still conflicting. Some author suggest that pentoxifylline could be a better first-line treatment in patients with severe AH. Absolute abstinence is a basic condition for any treatment of acute or chronic ALD, the other therapeutical procedure being of a supportive nature and questionable significance. Acamprosate appears to be an effective treatment strategy for supporting continuous abstinence in alcohol dependent patients. Patients with advanced liver cirrhosis who demonstrably abstain can be considered for liver transplantation, which leads to a markedly prolonged life expectancy. The crucial step in ALD prevention is in the prevention of alcohol abuse, whereas the prevention of liver injury in <b>active</b> alcohol <b>abusers</b> is not clinically applicable...|$|R
40|$|Gender {{differences}} in vulnerability for cocaine addiction have been reported. Though the mechanisms are not understood, here we hypothesize that gender {{differences in}} reactivity to conditioned-cues, which contributes to relapse, are involved. To test this we compared brain metabolism (using PET and ¹⁸FDG) between female (n =  10) and male (n =  16) <b>active</b> cocaine <b>abusers</b> when they watched a neutral video (nature scenes) versus a cocaine-cues video. Self-reports of craving increased with the cocaine-cue video but responses did not differ between genders. In contrast, changes in whole brain metabolism with cocaine-cues differed by gender (p< 0. 05); females significantly decreased metabolism (- 8. 6 %± 10) whereas males tended to increase it (+ 5. 5 %± 18). SPM analysis (Cocaine-cues vs Neutral) in females revealed decreases in frontal, cingulate and parietal cortices, thalamus and midbrain (p< 0. 001) whereas males showed increases in right inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44 / 45) (only at p< 0. 005). The gender-cue interaction showed greater decrements with Cocaine-cues in females than males (p< 0. 001) in frontal (BA 8, 9, 10), anterior cingulate (BA 24, 32), posterior cingulate (BA 23, 31), inferior parietal (BA 40) and thalamus (dorsomedial nucleus). Females showed greater brain reactivity to cocaine-cues than males but no differences in craving, suggesting {{that there may be}} {{gender differences in}} response to cues that are not linked with craving but could affect subsequent drug use. Specifically deactivation of brain regions from "control networks" (prefrontal, cingulate, inferior parietal, thalamus) in females could increase their vulnerability to relapse since it would interfere with executive function (cognitive inhibition). This highlights the importance of gender tailored interventions for cocaine addiction...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} human {{significance}} {{of crack cocaine}} abuse by submitting its manifestation (logos) to existential-phenomenological analysis. The author conducted over fifty, first-hand interviews of recovering and <b>active</b> crack cocaine <b>abusers</b> toward disclosing the meaning of his to-be. What is revealed {{is the way the}} addiction reacts upon the with-structure of existence. Active crack cocaine addiction is being-high-and-free-of-craving. The singularity of this event eclipses the interhuman significance that substantially constitutes concern, as the meaning and Being of There-being, and radicalizes existence such that the “other ” is unceasingly projected as a means to free transcendence. The crack abuser forsakes the existentials being-with and There-being-with-others, ways of to-be that accommodate and gear into the existence of “others, ” to being-with-crack, a way of Being that is exclusively {{for the sake of the}} dependent’s “self. ” A Story of Human Being And they call that motherfucker, “sucking the devil’s dick. ” Because that’s what your doing, sucking the devil’s dick.

40|$|Dopamine (phasic release) is {{implicated in}} {{conditioned}} responses. Imaging studies in cocaine abusers show decreases in striatal dopamine levels, which we hypothesize may enhance conditioned responses since tonic dopamine levels modulate phasic dopamine release. To test this we assessed {{the effects of}} increasing tonic dopamine levels (using oral methylphenidate) on brain activation induced by cocaine-cues in cocaine abusers. Brain metabolism (marker of brain function) was measured with PET and (18) FDG in 24 <b>active</b> cocaine <b>abusers</b> tested four times; twice watching a Neutral video (nature scenes) and twice watching a Cocaine-cues video; each video was preceded once by placebo and once by methylphenidate (20 mg). The Cocaine-cues video increased craving {{to the same extent}} with placebo (68 %) and with methylphenidate (64 %). In contrast, SPM analysis of metabolic images revealed that differences between Neutral versus Cocaine-cues conditions were greater with placebo than methylphenidate; whereas with placebo the Cocaine-cues decreased metabolism (p< 0. 005) in left limbic regions (insula, orbitofrontal, accumbens) and right parahippocampus, with methylphenidate it only decreased in auditory and visual regions, which also occurred with placebo. Decreases in metabolism in these regions were not associated with craving; in contrast the voxel-wise SPM analysis identified significant correlations with craving in anterior orbitofrontal cortex (p< 0. 005), amygdala, striatum and middle insula (p< 0. 05). This suggests that methylphenidate's attenuation of brain reactivity to Cocaine-cues is distinct from that involved in craving. Cocaine-cues decreased metabolism in limbic regions (reflects activity over 30 minutes), which contrasts with activations reported by fMRI studies (reflects activity over 2 - 5 minutes) that may reflect long-lasting limbic inhibition following activation. Studies to evaluate the clinical significance of methylphenidate's blunting of cue-induced limbic inhibition may help identify potential benefits of this medication in cocaine addiction...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} the risks of drug abuse {{as a form of}} deviant {{behavior}} in the context of adolescence. In this study deviant behavior appears as actions (or willingness to commit them), contrary to the generally accepted cultural and moral values, as well as socio-psychological and legal norms, including the abuse of alcohol, drugs and other psychoactive substances Study prerequisites for the formation of drug addiction in adolescence age allows us to trace the link between awareness about drugs and those at risk of developing dependence on them, which are due to the age and psychological characteristics described L. S. Vygotsky and other scientists working in the paradigm of cultural-historical psychology. The article hypothesized that narcogene information can act as a factor of risk of drug use. It is argued that the basis of the commission of a narcotic substance samples is narcogene information and control over the sources that may contribute to the prevention of mass anesthesia teenagers. This assertion is supported by the results of a retrospective study of social and psychological factors in the emergence of drug abuse conducted in the Kabardino-Balkaria republic dispensary, which was attended by 24 active addict aged 18 - 28 who are registered with the method of questioning. Purpose.   To study the role of information on drugs and drug addiction in the range of solutions «for» or «against» in a situation narcogene risk. Methodology.   Questioning of <b>active</b> drug <b>abusers.</b> Results.  Based on a retrospective analysis of risk factors for drug abuse as a form of deviant behavior found that narcogene information may lead to introduction to drugs. Lack of knowledge about the effects of drugs on the human body, and the temptation to create a stable, creates a high risk on narcotics debut. Drug use leads to a decrease of expression of fear and inadequate assessment of the degree of its danger. It creates a false impression that the drug is easy to give an adult, strong-willed people, and those who have recently started to use. It was found that adults from teenager entourage (parents, teachers, and others.) Play a minor role in the prevention on narcotics «infection» and their opinion is unconvincing compared with the ideas of potential or actual supporters of drug addiction. The findings suggest the importance of narcogene information in choosing «for» or «against» drug use in adolescence. Practical implications.  The system of education. </p...|$|R
