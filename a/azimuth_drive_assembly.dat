40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} elevation and <b>azimuth</b> <b>drive</b> configurations on DSS- 13 antenna performance {{are presented as}} well as a study of gearbox stiffness and motor inertia. Small motor inertia and rigid gearboxes would improve the pointing accuracy up to a certain limit. The limit is imposed by critical values of gearbox stiffness and motor inertia introduced in the article. The critical values depend on the lowest structural frequency of the rate-loop model. The tracking performance can be improved by raising gearbox stiffness to the critical stiffness and reducing motor inertia to the critical inertia. An <b>azimuth</b> <b>drive</b> configuration with four driven wheels was also investigated. For the four-wheel <b>drive</b> configuration in <b>azimuth,</b> the cross-coupling effects are reduced and wind disturbance rejection properties improved. Pointing is improved substantially in the cross-elevation but is relatively unaffected in the elevation direction. More significant improvements can be achieved through either structural redesign (stiffening the structure) or new control algorithms or control concepts, which would eliminate the effect of flexible deformations on the antenna pointing accuracy. Although the study is performed for the DSS- 13 antenna, the results can be extended for other DSN antennas...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{a method}} of using a root hinge <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> (RHDA) to control the solar array {{deployment}} is provided and a multi-DOF mechanism dynamic model {{of the system is}} established. In this way, the root hinge torque can be calculated iteratively. Then taking the predicted torque as a reference, a RHDA is designed for a large multiple-stage packaging and deployable solar array system. The control effect of the <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> is validated by ground tests. The test results indicate that the solar arrays can be deployed smoothly, and the deployment velocities are restricted by the <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> as expected. During the tests, the RHDA output speed and output torque are obtained. In order to examine the impact force when the yoke is lock-up with a hard stop, dynamics simulations are performed according to the actual behavior. The simulation result indicates that the designed RHDA reduces the impact force significantly and improves the lock-up reliability effectively...|$|R

40|$|Synchronous Motor (PMSM) is an {{important}} process in industries, especially in the hard disk <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> processes. For example, the automatic screw machine is one of important machines in the hard disk <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> processes. The PMSM is a fundamental component of the automatic screw machine. The feedback torque control system use estimated torque received from motor current. The disturbance torque caused by the screw process depends {{on the quality of}} the screw heads and screw holes. The automatic screw machine requires precise output torque because the error of output torque affects the automatic screw machine performance. The damage in the hard disk <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> process may result from an inaccurate output torque. For instance, the defect of product is broken threads of the screws and the out of length of the screw heads. When the control process requires precision output torque, the machines must be calibrated by operator with standard value consumed 20 - 30 minutes per machine. This paper presents a torque control system with an adaptive fuzzy logic compensator for torque control and torque estimation simultaneously.
