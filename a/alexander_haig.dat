25|$|In 1982, Argentina was in {{the midst}} of a devastating {{economic}} crisis and large-scale civil unrest against the repressive military junta that was governing the country. On 2 April, with Argentine Navy commander-in-chief Admiral Jorge Anaya as the main architect and supporter of the operation, a combined Argentine amphibious force invaded the Islands. Immediately, the UK severed diplomatic ties with Argentina, and began to assemble a task force to retake the Islands. A diplomatic offensive began, to gain support for economic and military sanctions. The United Nations Security Council issued Resolution 502 calling on Argentina to withdraw forces from the Islands and on both parties to seek a diplomatic solution. Another resolution called for an immediate ceasefire, but this was vetoed by both the United States and the United Kingdom. The European Community condemned the invasion and imposed economic sanctions on Argentina, although several EC states expressed reservations about British policy in this area, and two EC states (Denmark and the Republic of Ireland) defected from co-operation. France and Germany also temporarily suspended several military contracts with the Argentine military. The United States supported mediated talks, via Secretary of State <b>Alexander</b> <b>Haig,</b> and initially took a neutral stance, although in private substantial material aid was made available to the UK from the moment of invasion. The US publicly supported the UK's position following the failure of peace talks.|$|E

500|$|Domestically, the {{reaction}} to the cancellation was split along partisan lines.

Congressman Robert Dornan (R-CA) claimed, [...] "They're breaking out the vodka and caviar in Moscow." [...] In contrast, it appears the Soviets were more concerned by large numbers of ALCMs representing a much greater threat than a smaller number of B-1s. Soviet news agency TASS commented that [...] "the implementation of these militaristic plans has seriously complicated efforts for the limitation of the strategic arms race." [...] Western military leaders were generally happy with the decision. NATO commander <b>Alexander</b> <b>Haig</b> described the ALCM as an [...] "attractive alternative" [...] to the B-1.
