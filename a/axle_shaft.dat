5000|$|Dodge {{versions}} were {{passenger side}} differential drop, standard rotation gears, kingpin knuckles and 35 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> in early models. The 2nd Generation axles were driver's side with ball joints. 30 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> were {{used instead of}} 35 splines, except 2000, 2001 and 2002 models which were equipped with 32 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1989, {{the gear}} ratios changed, front brakes and outer <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> were made larger, the rear {{differential}} was reinforced {{and the front}} <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> were identical lengths thanks to an intermediate extension shaft.|$|R

50|$|A {{benefit of}} a full-floating axle is that even if an <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> (used to {{transmit}} torque or power) breaks, the wheel will not come off, possibly preventing a serious accident.|$|E
5000|$|A full-floating <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> {{does not}} carry the vehicle's weight; it serves only to {{transmit}} torque from the differential to the wheels. It [...] "floats" [...] inside an assembly {{that carries the}} vehicle's weight. Thus the only stress it must endure is torque (not lateral bending force). Full-floating axle shafts are retained by a flange bolted to the hub, while the hub and bearings are retained on the spindle by a large nut. In contrast, a semi-floating design carries {{the weight of the}} vehicle on the <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> itself; there is a single bearing {{at the end of the}} axle housing that carries the load from the axle and that the axle rotates through.|$|E

50|$|The Dana 44 {{rear axle}} first saw {{use in the}} 1940s and is still in use today. The Dana 44 has a GAWR up to 3500 lb and is a {{semi-floating}} type, having one bearing {{on the end of}} the <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> which carries the weight of the vehicle on the axle and also allows axle rotation.|$|E
50|$|On {{cars and}} trucks, several senses {{of the word}} axle occur in casual usage, {{referring}} to the shaft itself, its housing, or simply any transverse pair of wheels. Strictly speaking, a shaft which rotates with the wheel, being either bolted or splined in fixed relation to it, is called an axle or <b>axle</b> <b>shaft.</b> However, in looser usage, an entire assembly including the surrounding axle housing (typically a casting) is also called an axle.|$|E
5000|$|All Dana 70 {{rear axles}} are full {{floating}} and typically have a gross axle rating of 7500 lbs. The Dana 70 rear axle {{was first used}} in the Dodge W300 in 1958. The Dana 70 started out using 10 spline pinions and 23 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts.</b> The later, more current, Dana 70 axles use 29 spline pinions and 32 or 35 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts.</b> Dana offered two different limited slip differentials with the Dana 70, the [...] "Power-Lok" [...] and the [...] "Trac-Lok." ...|$|R
50|$|The Dana 60 {{front axle}} {{has a great}} deal of aftermarket/third-party support, {{including}} many upgrades. Stronger <b>axle</b> <b>shafts,</b> universal joints and ball joints are widely available. As well as a large selection of traction control devices such as locking differentials and limited slip differentials. <b>Axle</b> <b>shafts,</b> universal joints and carriers made from chromoly steel are even available. High capacity differential covers are available that increase the amount of oil the differential holds. These covers also feature heat sinks that help keep the axle cool.|$|R
5000|$|... 35c is {{a little}} bit newer version of dana35. C stands for a C clip which holds the <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> in the carrier. It uses a centre pin to lock the shafts in.|$|R
50|$|Employing {{his skills}} as a {{mechanical}} engineer, he devised a water engine for the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in 1761 and a watermill at Alston, Cumbria in 1767 (he is credited by some with inventing the cast-iron <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> for waterwheels). In 1782 he built the Chimney Mill at Spital Tongues in Newcastle upon Tyne, the first 5-sailed smock mill in Britain. He also improved Thomas Newcomen's atmospheric engine, erecting one at Chacewater mine, Wheal Busy, in Cornwall in 1775.|$|E
50|$|A later {{variant of}} the trunk engine re-visited the return {{connecting}} rod layout as the vibrating lever or half-trunk engine. This was a paired engine with two short-stroke trunk engines facing outwards. Their connecting rods from the pistons led to upright 'vibrating levers' that could rock back and forth. These levers rotated a short <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> with further levers on it that in turn drove another pair of connecting rods and a shared central crankshaft. These complex engines were {{the invention of the}} Swedish-American engineer John Ericsson and were little used outside these two countries.|$|E
5000|$|Having {{already found}} {{success with the}} world's first main line {{electrification}} project in Baltimore in 1895, ALCO and General Electric were tasked with designing a new locomotive for the project with Alco building the engine and GE supplying the electrical equipment. The initial prototype locomotive, delivered as Class L #6000, was in the 1-D-1 configuration with 4 gearless [...] "bi-polar" [...] type traction motors which used the <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> as the motor armature. Between October 1904 and July 1906 #6000 racked up 50,000 miles in test on a track near both Alco and GE plants in Schenectady, New York.|$|E
5000|$|The first Dana 70 {{front axle}} {{was used in}} 1958 by Dodge in the W300, in both 4.88 and 5.87 ratios. International started using Dana 70 front axles in the late 1960s. Both {{companies}} used Dana 70 front axles until the mid-1970s (Dodge W300 pickup up until 1978, discontinued in 1979). All of these Dana 70 front axles were closed knuckle, with king pins and had a GAWR of 6000 lbs. Like the rear Dana 70 axles, the Dana 70 front axle started out with 23 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> {{and then went to}} 35 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts.</b> While these <b>axles</b> were being manufactured, Dana offered a [...] "Power-Lok" [...] limited slip differential for some of these axles.|$|R
5000|$|Ford {{versions}} are driver's side differential drop, reverse-cut gears, and kingpin knuckles up to 1991. The later axles have ball joints. Ford Dana 60 axles mostly feature 35 spline inner <b>axle</b> <b>shafts,</b> {{but some are}} 30 spline. Larger brakes and 35 spline outer shafts were made standard in 2005.|$|R
50|$|The Dana 45 was {{introduced}} during the 1950s as an upgraded Dana 44 with larger 20 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts.</b> Since the Dana 45 {{is no longer}} being made {{you can use the}} Dana 44 gears in the Dana 45 housing if you use model 53 pinion bearings and lots of shims.|$|R
50|$|The first {{design was}} {{produced}} from 1973 to 1984. The first design remained unchanged until 1986. This design had drums that were held {{on by the}} wheel studs and had a smaller diameter pinion bearing than the second design. The second design was produced from 1986 to present. One change {{that occurred in the}} second design was that on some models the brake drum could be removed without having to remove the hub and <b>axle</b> <b>shaft.</b> Additionally, the pinion received a larger diameter bearing while the pinion stayed the same diameter, which increased the durability of the pinion. All these axle are full floating.|$|E
50|$|A {{center axle}} {{disconnect}} system or CAD {{is an alternative}} to locking hubs. CAD systems are typically used in front drive axles on four wheel drive vehicles. A CAD system works by having an <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> (typically the longer shaft) split into two pieces. One piece {{is connected to the}} carrier, the other connected to the wheel. This reduces drag on the axle by allowing only the spider and side gears to spin, while the differential carrier, pinion and drive shaft are at rest. The axle is engaged by connecting the two split axle shafts. The ends of the axles are typically splined and use a collar to connect the two shafts together by sliding over both shafts.|$|E
50|$|The full-floating {{design is}} {{typically}} used in most 3/4- and 1-ton light trucks, medium duty trucks and heavy-duty trucks, {{as well as}} most agricultural applications, such as large tractors and self-propelled agricultural machinery. There are a few exceptions, such as many Land-Rover vehicles and in American stock car racing since the early 1960s. The overall assembly can carry more weight than a semi-floating or non-floating axle assembly, because the hubs have two bearings riding on a fixed spindle. A full-floating axle can be identified by a protruding hub to which the <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> flange is bolted. The semi-floating design is found under most 1/2-ton and lighter trucks and SUVs and rear-wheel-drive passenger cars, usually being smaller or less expensive models.|$|E
50|$|The 2009 Liberty was {{relatively}} unchanged from the 2008 models {{with the exception}} of stiffer rear <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> and retuned springs, shocks, anti-roll bars, steering gear valve, low rollback brake calipers and a revised brake pedal ratio. The six-speed manual transmission was dropped, and the four-speed automatic was now standard.|$|R
50|$|Key {{products}} include <b>axles,</b> drive <b>shafts,</b> {{universal joints}} and sealing and thermal-management products.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, the {{lightweight}} Goggomobil used a similar suspension design to the Scarab. Much simpler though, the Goggomobil had bare drive shafts that also acted as the suspension links, with suspension forces {{passing through the}} inboard Hooke joints. The swing <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> were only carried by the trailing radius rods, rather than an axle casing, and the long struts were shortened to a simple coilover shock absorber.|$|R
50|$|The truck, {{available}} {{only as a}} kit, comes equipped with twin 540-J size sealed endbell stock motors wired in parallel when using the standard mechanical speed control. The motors feed power through a closed gear-reduction transmission terminating in a single dual-end output shaft which subsequently turn metal telescoping driveshafts running to each axle. The two axles feature the additional bracing and updated gear arrangement and specifications of the Juggernaut 2 truck which improve durability and lifespan while reducing the chance of gear misalignment under large torque loads. The 12mm hex {{at the end of}} each <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> keys into a widened 5-hole hub akin to the Clod Buster hub to increase track width. Main stress-bearing internal gear shafts in the transmission and axles are supported by metal shielded bearings, while the rest of the gears in the truck spin on metal bushings.|$|E
5000|$|This style limited-slip {{differential}} {{works by}} using a gerotor pump to hydraulically compress a clutch to transfer torque to the wheel that is rotating slower. The gerotor pump uses the differential carrier or cage to drive the outer rotor of the pump and one <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> to drive the inner rotor. When {{there is a difference}} between the left and right wheels' speed, the pump pressurizes the hydraulic fluid causing the clutch to compress. thereby causing the torque to be transferred to the wheel that is rotating slower. These pump-based systems have lower and upper limits on applied pressure which allows the differential to work like a conventional or open differential until there is a significant speed difference between the right and left wheel, and internal damping to avoid hysteresis. The newest gerotor pump based system has computer regulated output for more versatility and no oscillation.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{changes were}} {{in store for}} the Plymouth Duster. Simpler single-piston slider-type disc brake {{calipers}} were introduced for 1973 (standard on 318-powered cars and with power-assist on 340 models), replacing the Kelsey Hayes four-piston calipers. Disc brake-equipped Dusters now had the more-common 5-lugs on 4.5" [...] wheel bolt pattern. All 340 and some 318 engine-equipped cars received the simplified 8.25" [...] rear axle assembly (with wheel bearings riding directly on the <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> and endplay being taken by C-clips); these axles also featured the 5-on-4.5" [...] wheel bolt pattern. (This axle assembly replaced the 8.75" [...] "drop-out" [...] arrangement seen on some 1966-1972 A-bodies). The 225-powered cars retained the 5-lugs on 4" [...] pattern on vehicles with the standard drum brakes. A three speed Torque Flight automatic along with a manual transmission was offered with the 225 slant six. All models received larger front wheel bearings and increased spindle diameter. Electronic ignition became standard across the board.|$|E
40|$|<b>Axles</b> and <b>shafts</b> are {{of prime}} {{importance}} concerning {{safety in the}} transportation industry and railway in particular. Design rules for <b>axles</b> and <b>shafts</b> are mainly based on endurance curves for the material used according to the established standards and procedures. Recently, the knowledge of fatigue crack growth under typical loading conditions of <b>axles</b> and <b>shafts</b> with rotating bending and steady torsion is being object of research and industrial studies in order to apply damage tolerance concepts, mainly for maintenance purposes. The effect of a steady torsion on fatigue crack growth under rotating bending is focused in this paper. While <b>axles</b> and <b>shafts</b> in the transportation industry are traditionally designed on steels, the need for weight reduction due to fuel economy and eco-design constraints, lightweight materials must be considered for these applications. In this study, fatigue crack growth on rotating bending <b>axles</b> and <b>shafts</b> with or without an applied steady torsion is presented. Fracture mechanics approaches are {{used to analyze the}} results based on Stress Intensity Factors developed for bending and torsion in shafts and show fatigue crack growth retardation when steady torsion is applied. Fractographic observations using SEM are presented and helped to explain the fatigue crack growth retardation observed when steady torsion is applied to rotating bending. Results are compared for the same loading conditions on steels and relevant differences on fatigue crack growth are commented...|$|R
50|$|The 1989 Blazer had new {{base and}} up-level grilles, {{as well as}} new {{headlight}} bezels, body side moldings, and bumper rub strips. Corporate 10-bolt axles were upgraded to 30 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> from previous 28 spline. New for 1989 was the introduction of an all-new base coat/clear coat paint. The standard L05 5.7-liter V-8 now had serpentine accessory drive belts in place of the older multi-belt accessory drive.|$|R
50|$|Although {{a widely}} used system, {{this system is}} not as {{efficient}} as a system with locking hubs. A CAD system spins the <b>axle</b> <b>shafts,</b> spider gears, and side gears in the carrier during normal driving. Locking hubs disengage the axle at the wheels, allowing all of the axle to be at rest during normal driving. Not as efficient as locking hubs, a CAD system still makes for much less drag than having the axle completely locked in.|$|R
