40|$|Employer-provided health {{insurance}} in the United States {{is suspected of}} restricting job mobility, resulting in “job lock. ” Previous research on job lock finds mixed results using several methodologies. We take {{a new approach to}} examine whether employer-based {{health insurance}} discourages job mobility by exploiting the discontinuity created at age 65 through the qualification for Medicare.

Our results are robust to different bandwidths, non-linear age profiles, and frequency of age measurement. The upper bounds of 95 percent confidence intervals for these estimates can rule out the existence of any job lock in some cases, and in most cases can rule out the large levels of job lock found in many previous studies in the literature.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} financial equilibrium analysis. The model is based on relation between net working capital, necessary of working capital and net treasury of the firm. Based on the Pearson correlation coefficient and rank Spearman correlation coefficient, we have determined {{the intensity of the}} connection between the stability level, which is an expression of long term equilibrium, and different financial indicators yearly adjusted. Its applicability on Romanian companies traded at Bucharest Stock Exchange is limited by the insufficient amount of information. The list of indicators related to stability should be completed with some more indicators, such as the added value, the expenses profitableness, the financial result and so on. It is well-known that the life of an enterprise re{{presents a}} succession of circumstances which drives to situations more or less difficult. Some of them are prevented and avoided even before they occur, others the most serious, are sometimes hard to endure and become fatal for the enterprise. To maintain of a good financial situation, to continue the activity in conditions of efficiency and efficacy, to reach the goals established, the enterprise and her managers must continually adapt the way of administration in the aim to compensate the changes that the socio-economical environment has on the activity of the enterprise. The neglect of this changes and the absence of proper <b>administration</b> <b>measure</b> compromise the maintaining of a good financial situation. The problem of financial equilibrium is often associated with financial stability. An enterprise is financial stable if it has a good financial situation. A way to measure stability is based on the opinion that stability is considered the situation {{in which there is a}} consistency between the amount and the structure of allowances in time as it follows [1]: Long term resources finance long term utilizations Short term resources finance short term utilization...|$|E

These values were then codified based on snow presence determined by both sensors (code = 10), CDR only (11), SSMI(S) only (12), and no snow (20). For this research, we assumed that a positive snow code from either or both sensors indicated snow presence, and made our snow or no snow determination accordingly.

The energy-efficient manufactured homes have very low air exchange rates, significantly lower than either existing manufactured homes or site-built homes. The standard deviation of the effective leakage area for this sample of homes is small (25 % to 30 % of the mean), indicating that the leakiness of manufactured housing stock can be confidently characterized by the mean value. There is some indication of increased ventilation due to the energy-efficient whole-house ventilation specification, but not directly related to the operation of the wholehouse system.

A qualitative research approach was used to investigate SMT members' understanding of their duties within school management teams. Principals of three purposively selected Secondary Schools, in the Sepitsi circuit of the Lebowakgomo District of the Limpopo Province of South Africa, acted as participants for this study, together with two purposively selected members of their school's SMT. Each participant was interviewed, using a semi-structured interview. The study was framed by a conceptual framework made up of concepts gleaned from distributed leadership theory, together with the core duties of SMT members as stipulated in the PAM (1998). The main {{findings of this study}} are that most principals still have a problem regarding the concept of working as a team and that although participants have access to the PAM document, many have not read it and therefore do not know what their roles on the SMT require.
