5|$|Through {{ecological}} {{modeling and}} retrospective studies, {{research has shown}} a link between bee colony collapse <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> change. Although the shifting weather conditions themselves negatively affect bees, the link between colony collapse <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> change is also {{closely tied to the}} interaction between bees’ climatic niches and food-plant reductions. Climate change affects the floral environment by stunting flower development and nectar production, which in turn directly impacts colonies’ abilities to collect pollen and sustain themselves.|$|E

Method: We used a multi-method, cross-sectional approach to collect survey data of quality management systems and perceived teamwork <b>and</b> safety <b>climate.</b> Our data analyses included descriptive and multilevel regression methods. Setting and Participants: Data on implementation of quality management system from seven European countrieswere evaluated including patient safety culture surveys from 3622 clinical leaders and 4903 frontline clinicians. Main Outcome Measures: Perceived teamwork <b>and</b> safety <b>climate.</b> Results: Teamwork climate was reported as positive by 67 % of clinical leaders and 43 % of frontline clinicians. Safety climate was perceived as positive by 54 % of clinical leaders and 32 % of frontline clinicians. We found positive associations between implementation of quality management systems and teamwork <b>and</b> safety <b>climate.</b> Conclusions: Our findings, which should {{be placed in a}} broader clinical quality improvement context, point to the importance of quality management systems as a supportive structural feature for promoting teamwork <b>and</b> safety <b>climate.</b> To gain a deeper understanding of this association, further qualitative and quantitative studies using longitudinally collected data are recommended. The study also confirms that more clinical leaders than frontline clinicians have a positive perception of teamwork <b>and</b> safety <b>climate.</b> Such differences should be accounted for in daily clinical practice and when tailoring initiatives to improve teamwork <b>and</b> safety <b>climate...</b>|$|R

5|$|Throughout the Cold War era, {{radar and}} antenna related {{applications}} remained a prominent research activity in EES' {{contracts with the}} Defense Department. Millimeter wave radar research, in particular, was prominent in EES' defense activities from the late 1950s, when the first military-designation millimeter wave radar was built at Georgia Tech, to the 1980s, when GTRI developed {{what was then the}} world's highest frequency microwave radar. EES' high-frequency radar research found applications in radio astronomy, meteorology <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> studies, which improved weather forecasting <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> models and assisted in NASA's planning of the Cassini and Galileo missions. Expansion of EES' antenna research in the 1970s, in particular, the development of an air defense antenna for the U.S. Army Missile Command, resulted in the establishment of the Huntsville Research Laboratory, GTRI's oldest off-campus research center.|$|E
