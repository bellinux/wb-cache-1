500|$|Actress Anna Torv {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with MTV News that [...] "August" [...] was one of her favorite episodes because [...] "We sort of get to meet the Observers. At the moment what we know about them, they... seemingly just observe. That's kind of it, but [...] the episode that we have coming up, we're not sure if <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> just observe".|$|E
500|$|Tim Burton avoided using {{too many}} digital effects {{because he wanted}} the younger actors {{to feel as if}} they were working in a {{realistic}} environment. As a result, forced perspective techniques, oversized props and scale models were used to avoid computer-generated imagery (CGI). Deep Roy was cast to play the Oompa-Loompas based on his previous collaborations with Burton on Planet of the Apes and Big Fish. The actor was able to play various Oompa-Loompas using split screen photography, digital and front projection effects. [...] "Tim told me that the Oompa-Loompas were strictly programmed, like robotsâ€” <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> work, work, work," [...] Roy commented. [...] "So {{when it comes time to}} dance, they're like a regiment; they do the same steps." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1964 season, Timberlake {{was awarded}} the Chicago Tribune Silver Football as the Most Valuable Player in the Big Ten Conference. [...] He placed fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting (losing to Notre Dame's John Huarte), and was also named to {{multiple}} All-American teams. [...] After attending an All-American dinner at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, Timberlake reported, [...] "There {{is a great deal of}} loneliness in being an All-America[...] [...] [...] I get sick of it. [...] They all want to shake your hand, but they don't really know you. [...] <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> stick out the glad hand. [...] I don't mind talking to anyone who is interested in ideas, but nothing makes me sicker than having my name dropped by people who don't know anything about me except that I'm an All-America." [...] He joked that he might write an autobiography called, [...] "The Loneliness of an All-America." [...] He was also an A-minus student majoring in sociology, was named a scholar-athlete by National Football Association, and was placed on the Big Ten All-Academic team two years in a row.|$|E
2500|$|Peggy Lipton {{claims that}} Presley was [...] "virtually impotent" [...] with her. She {{attributed}} his impotence to his boyishness and heavy drug abuse. [...] Cassandra Peterson, {{better known as}} [...] "Elvira', says she knew Presley for only one night and <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> talk.|$|R
50|$|Losing team: Apex, {{their sales}} were only $1,060.47 and they only sold two dresses. Apex {{did not have}} any {{marketing}} strategy. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to hand out flyers at Grand Central Terminal & Penn Station, which didn't attract any customers to their bridal shop.|$|R

60|$|Pala. No, never, except I {{were married}} to you: married people can never oblige one another; for <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> duty, and {{consequently}} {{there can be no}} thanks: But love is more frank and generous than he is honest; he's a liberal giver, but a cursed pay-master.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{bacteriological}} test. There is {{no getting}} away from it. Doctor Hervey--he's our expert, you know--was {{the first man to}} apply it here. He is a wizard. He knows more about leprosy than any living man, and if a cure is ever discovered, he'll be that discoverer. As for the test, it is very simple. They have succeeded in isolating the bacillus leprae and studying it. They know it now when they see it. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to snip a bit of skin from the suspect and subject it to the bacteriological test. A man without any visible symptoms may be chock full of the leprosy bacilli." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{his mother}} {{could not bear}} to face any one else, Jock thought the sooner he could get her home the better, and <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to buy some of Armine's {{favourite}} biscuits, and likewise to stop at Rivington's, where she chose the two smallest and neatest Greek Testaments she could find.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] {{continued}} the other, [...] "tell me, honestly, Ned, {{do you find}} that people who read God's Word and sing His praise and ask His blessing on <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>are</b> generally bad fathers, and mothers, and masters, and servants, and children, and that from their ranks come the worst people in society?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{investigations}} satisfy me, {{that the}} company was a swindle", said Justice McNaughten in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. [...] "An investigation is necessary...There was a gross fraud on the part of one of the promoters. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to produce one abortive film. There is no doubt that this is a case for the most searching investigation." ...|$|R
60|$|Pleasure is a bait to {{the mind}}, {{and the mind}} will attract the body: where the heart is, the object shall always have the body's company. The great {{objection}} I meet with from young tradesmen against this argument is, they follow no unlawful pleasures; they do not spend their time in taverns, and drinking to excess; they do not spend their money in gaming, and so stock-starve their business, and rob the shop to supply the extravagant losses of play; or they do not spend their hours in ill company and debaucheries; <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>is</b> a little innocent diversion in riding abroad now and then for the air, and for their health, and to ease their thoughts of the throng of other affairs which are heavy upon them, &c.|$|E
6000|$|... "But you can't tackle it at {{this time}} of year, with winter comin' on," [...] he advised Saxon. [...] "The thing for you to do is head south for warmer weather--say along the coast. It don't snow down there. I tell you what you do. Go down by San Jose and Salinas an' come out on the coast at Monterey. South of that you'll find {{government}} land mixed up with forest reserves and Mexican rancheros. It's pretty wild, without any roads to speak of. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> handle cattle. But there's some fine redwood canyons, with good patches of farming ground that run right down to the ocean. I was talkin' last year with a fellow that's been all through there. An' I'd a-gone, like you an' Billy, only Sarah wouldn't hear of it. There's gold down there, too. Quite a bunch is in there prospectin', an' two or three good mines have opened. But that's farther along and in a ways from the coast. You might take a look." ...|$|E
6000|$|These {{may seem}} lofty words, but I {{do not think}} {{they are likely to}} make us lofty-minded. I think that the belief of them will tend to make us all more reverent and earnest in {{examining}} the utterances of others, more simple and truthful in giving vent to our own, fearing equally all prejudiced and hasty criticism, all self-willed mannerism, all display of fine words, as sins against the divine dignity of language. From these assertions I think we may conclude what is the true method of studying style. The critical examination of good authors, looking at language as an inspiration, and its laws as things independent of us, eternal and divine, we must search into them as we would into any other set of facts, in nature, or the Bible, by patient induction. We must not be content with any traditional maxims, or abstract rules, such as have been put forth in Blair and Lord Kaimes, for these are merely worked out by the head, and can give us no insight into the magic which touches the heart. All abstract rules of criticism, indeed, are very barren. We may read whole folios of them without getting one step farther than we were at first, viz. that what is beautiful is beautiful. Indeed, these abstract rules generally tend to narrow our notions of what is beautiful, in their attempt to explain spiritual things by the carnal understanding. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to explain them away, and so those who depend on them are tempted to deny the beauty of every thing which cannot be thus analysed and explained away, according to the established rule and method. I shall have to point out this again to you, when we come to speak of the Pope and Johnson school of critics, {{and the way in which}} they wrote whole folios on Shakespeare, without ever penetrating a single step deeper towards the secret of his sublimity. It was just this idolatry of abstract rules which made Johnson call Bishop Percy's invaluable collection of ancient ballads [...] "stuff and nonsense." [...] It was this which made Voltaire talk of [...] "Hamlet" [...] as the ravings of a drunken savage, because forsooth it could not be crammed into the artificial rules of French tragedy. It is this which, even at this day, makes some men of highly-cultivated taste declare that they can see no poetry in the writings of Mr. Tennyson; the cause, little as they are aware of it, simply being that neither his excellences nor his faults are after the model of the Etonian classical school which reigned in England fifty years ago. When these critics speak of that with which they sympathise they are admirable. They become childish only when they resolve to bind all by maxims which may suit themselves.|$|E
50|$|The Culhanesâ€”The {{adventures of}} the Culhane family, {{depicted}} as <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> sit on an old-fashioned {{sofa in the}} parlor, which focused on Cousin Clem Culhane (Gordie Tapp); Cousin Junior Culhane (Junior Samples); Cousin Grandpa Culhane (Grandpa Jones); and Cousin Lulu Culhane (Lulu Roman) who would sit in deadpan character and comment, Ã  la soap opera. After the death of Samples, his role was filled by cast member Mike Snider {{in the role of}} Cousin Mike.|$|R
5000|$|Musician Henry Rollins {{wrote in}} {{response}} to the incident, [...] "CorrÃ© and Westwood might think they have taught everyone a lesson in what punkâ€™s all about, but <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> show off their massive egos and how much theyâ€™ve lost the plot. Maybe it was something else, too. Perhaps it was an emotional response to the fact that McLaren cut CorrÃ© out of his will. It doesnâ€™t matter now. Itâ€™s yesterdayâ€™s garbage. Ooh, how punk." ...|$|R
5000|$|Karakozov {{was born}} in the family of a minor nobility in Kostroma. He grew to hate his class because <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> [...] "suck the peasants' blood." [...] He studied at Kazan University 1861-64 and at Moscow State University 1864-66. He was {{expelled}} from both which led to depression and a failed suicide bid. In early 1866 he {{became a member of the}} [...] "revolutionary wing" [...] of the Ishutin Society, founded by his cousin Nikolai Ishutin in Moscow in 1863.|$|R
5000|$|It was me {{who told}} Casillo to keep {{documentary}} {{evidence of the}} meetings he had with these people, whom I didnt trust because <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> sell hope by the ton to the poor people, and then, when things dont work as they expected or when theyve got what they wanted, they cast you adrift.|$|E
5000|$|Jillian Trezise typifies the {{attitude}} often taken by child development specialists and educators towards smart toys, [...] "...if kids can't take their expensive toys to the sandpit or open {{them up to}} see how they work, then they don't provide much educational value. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> entertain and they don't hold young people's attention for very long." ...|$|E
50|$|SkjÃ¡lfandi bay is an {{excellent}} place for fishing, especially for cod and lumpfish, so {{it is from the}} sea that most inhabitants take their living. The soil is very fertile, so they also practice agriculture. The inhabitants are completely autonomous, and almost <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> for their own consumption. Every house had a cow for milking and some sheep and hens.|$|E
5000|$|Variety said, [...] "Chorus {{often seems}} static and confined, rarely venturing beyond the immediate. Attenborough merely films the stage show {{as best he}} could. Nonetheless, the {{director}} and lenser Ronnie Taylor have {{done an excellent job}} working within the limitations, using every trick they could think of to keep the picture moving. More importantly, they have a fine cast, good music and a great, popular show to work with. So if <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> get it on film, that's not so bad." ...|$|R
60|$|So <b>all</b> <b>they</b> could <b>do</b> <b>was</b> {{to wait in}} {{fear and}} {{trembling}} for Hereward's return, and send Martin Lightfoot off to warn him, wherever he might be.|$|R

"Simonyi's {{dissertation}} was {{an attempt}} to describe a more efficient method of organizing programmers to write software... the metaprogrammer was the designer, decision maker, and communication controller in a software development group.... individual progammers were allowed to make no design decisions about the project. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> write the code as described by the metaprogrammer....

50|$|In Team Fortress 2 {{players can}} trade with other users for {{items such as}} weapons, cosmetics, weapon skins, and {{utilities}}. Weapons and utilities can change and affect gameplay in different ways, the main being; some weapons have different stats than others and thus allows a different playstyle. Cosmetic items, on the other hand, do not change game-play at all as <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> {{change the way the}} player looks.|$|E
5000|$|In {{retrospective}} reviews, AllMovie {{gave the}} film a negative review, noting that [...] "long stretches of {{not a lot}} happening are supposed to create suspense, but <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> delay the inevitable finale, which was the original audience's entire reason for being there since {{they knew it was}} going to include elements of The Exorcist." [...] The review concluded that The Antichrist [...] "probably was intense, but that intensity has diminished over the years" [...] and that the film was [...] "for Italian horror collectors only." ...|$|E

2500|$|Emperor Wen, {{believing that}} Tan Daoji was not {{initially}} {{involved in the}} plot to depose and kill Emperor Shao and Liu Yizhen, summoned Tan to the capital {{and put him in}} command of the army against Xie Hui. [...] He also summoned Wang Hong and made him the prime minister. [...] Meanwhile, Xie Hui publicly mourned Xu and Fu and declared that <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> for the empire, blaming Wang Hong, Wang Hong's brother Wang Tanshou (çŽ‹æ›‡é¦–, a close associate of Emperor Wen), and Wang Hua for falsely accusing them, and demanding their execution.|$|R

50|$|<b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> {{to lead a}} Christian life, an honourable {{thing to}} do. Nobody can claim, that Catholics are less perfect or loyal citizen, {{since there is no}} {{imposition}} from faith, which would limit love and obedience to country. The Pope is mostly concerned with the cunning ways of seducing the young. The damage could be enormous over time. He is also concerned that the Pope is described as an enemy of the people, accused of starting another war, although, he, the Pope works endlessly for peace and reconciliation. Attempts are made in Czechoslovakia, to create a peace-loving renegade Church, separate from Rome.|$|E
