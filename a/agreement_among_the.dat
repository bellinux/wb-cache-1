5|$|By <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Allied nations, in March 1942 the Pacific theatre {{was divided}} into two {{separate}} commands, {{each with its own}} commander-in-chief. The South West Pacific Area, which included Australia, Indonesia, and the Philippines came under General Douglas MacArthur as supreme commander. Most of the remainder, known as the Pacific Ocean Areas, came under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. There was no overall commander, and no authority capable of resolving competing claims for resources, setting priorities, or shifting resources from one command to the other. Such decisions had to be {{made on the basis of}} compromise, cooperation and consensus.|$|E
5|$|The delegates {{voted to}} address the {{platform}} before deciding on nominees, and debate began when they reconvened at 8:45p.m. Many fights and compromises had been hashed out in the Resolutions Committee already, but the delegates insisted on debating several provisions. On many planks, there was widespread <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> delegates. On the monetary issue, the platform declared that all money, whether metal or paper, should be issued by the government, not by banks (as was common for paper money at the time). They also called for the unlimited coinage of silver and the repayment of the national debt in bonds, rather than gold dollars. Other planks of the platform called for a graduated income tax, laws to mandate safe working conditions in factories, the regulation of interstate commerce, {{and an end to}} child and convict labor; all of these were familiar parts of Greenback platforms from earlier elections, and provoked no serious dissent.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{a series of}} operations against the Japanese bastion at Rabaul, which blocked any Allied advance along the northern coast of New Guinea towards the Philippines or northward towards the main Japanese naval base at Truk. In keeping with the overall Allied grand strategy of Europe first, the immediate aim of these operations was not the defeat of Japan but merely {{the reduction of the}} threat posed by Japanese aircraft and warships based at Rabaul to air and sea communications between the United States and Australia. By <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Allied nations, in March 1942 the Pacific theatre was divided into the South West Pacific Area, under General Douglas MacArthur, and the Pacific Ocean Areas, under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. Rabaul fell within MacArthur's area but the initial operations in the southern Solomon Islands came under Nimitz. The Japanese reaction was more violent than anticipated and some months passed before the Guadalcanal Campaign was brought to a successful conclusion. Meanwhile, General MacArthur's forces—primarily Australian—fought off a series of Japanese offensives in Papua in the Kokoda Track Campaign, Battle of Milne Bay, Battle of Buna-Gona, and the Battle of Wau.|$|E

Holbrooke was a leading contender to succeed the retiring Warren Christopher as Secretary of State but was passed over in 1996 as President Bill Clinton chose Madeleine Albright instead.

25|$|Wingate and {{the nine}} other crash victims were {{initially}} {{buried in a}} common grave close to the crash site {{near the village of}} Bishnupur in the present-day state of Manipur in India. The bodies were charred beyond recognition, hence individuals could not be identified under medical practices of the day, as identification from dental records was not possible. Since seven of the ten crash victims, including both pilots, were Americans, all ten bodies were exhumed in 1947 and reburied in Imphal, India and yet again exhumed in 1950 and flown to Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia for reburial. The exhumation was possible courtesy of an amicable three-way <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> governments of India, Britain and the United States, and in accordance with the families' wishes.|$|E
25|$|Under an October 1914 <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Allies, Greek forces re-entered Northern Epirus and the Italians {{seized the}} Vlore region. Greece officially annexed Northern Epirus in March 1916, but {{was forced to}} revoke by the Great Powers. During the war the French Army {{occupied}} the area around Korçë in 1916, and established the Republic of Korçë. In 1917 Greece {{lost control of the}} rest of Northern Epirus to Italy, who by then had taken over most of Albania. The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 awarded the area to Greece after World War I, however, political developments such as the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–22) and, crucially, Italian, Austrian and German lobbying in favor of Albania resulted in the area being ceded to Albania in November 1921.|$|E
25|$|In other cases, {{opinions}} differ, {{no consensus}} is forthcoming, {{and all are}} free to choose. With <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Fathers, though, the authority of interpretation grows, and full patristic consensus is very strong. With canon law (which tends to be highly rigorous and very strict, especially with clergy) an unalterable validity also does not apply, since canons deal with living on earth, where conditions are always changing and each case is subject to almost infinite variation from the next. Even when and where they were once used with full strictness, their application was not absolute, and was carried out for individuals under the pastoral care of their bishop, who {{had the authority to}} decide when individual discipline had been satisfied.

Stalin's proposal that Poland should be moved far to the west was readily accepted by the Polish communists, who were at that time {{in the early stages of}} forming a post-war government (the State National Council, a quasi-parliamentary body, was created). In July 1944, a communist-controlled Polish Committee of National Liberation was established in Lublin nominally to govern the areas liberated from German control, a move that prompted protests from Prime Minister Stanisław Mikołajczyk and his government-in-exile.|$|E
25|$|Distraught at the group's {{decision}} to stop touring, Epstein {{was diagnosed with}} glandular fever {{and went to a}} remote hotel in northern Wales to recover. On 5 August, he was called away to the United States to ameliorate the controversy that had resulted from the publication of Lennon's comment that the Beatles had become more popular than Christ. When the 1966 world tour resumed there on 12 August, the band were the subject of radio bans in some southern states and further death threats. According to Barrow, the {{decision to}} quit touring after 1966 was made without McCartney's agreement and marked {{the first time that the}} Beatles had committed to a course of action without unanimous <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> four.

25|$|Although Kyrgyzstan has {{abundant}} {{water running}} through it, its water supply {{is determined by}} a post-Soviet sharing <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> five Central Asian republics. As in the Soviet era, Kyrgyzstan {{has the right to}} 25% of the water that originates in its territory, but the new agreement allows Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan unlimited use of the water that flows into them from Kyrgyzstan, with no compensation for the nation at the source. Kyrgyzstan uses the entire amount to which the agreement entitles it, but utilization is skewed heavily in favor of agricultural irrigation. During the Soviet era, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan shared their abundant water resources with Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan during summer, and these three nations shared oil and gas with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in winter. According to the International Crisis Group, the skewed system that is currently in place could cause irreversible regional destabilization, and needs to be dealt with by international actors to avoid a crisis in Central Asia. In 1994 agriculture accounted for about 88% of total water consumption, compared with 8% by industry and 4% by municipal water distribution systems. According to World Bank experts, Kyrgyzstan has an adequate supply of high-quality water for future use, provided the resource is prudently managed.|$|E

25|$|Georgi Bliznashki's {{government}} was announced on 5 August and began its two-month mandate {{on the next}} day. On 6 August, {{in accordance with the}} previously made <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> main parties, Rosen Plevneliev officially disbanded the National Parliament. On 10 August, in an open letter to the media, Krasimira Medarova stated that she had requested from the president to step down from her position as minister in charge of the preparation for the early elections in order not to impede the work of the caretaker government after her appointment faced criticism from citizen organizations, protest network and the Reformist Bloc due to a presumed conflict of interest because of her previous affiliations with GERB. Medarova's case also sparked discussions regarding the viability of a separate ministerial post for the organization of the electoral processes and caused some controversy due to creating the impression that protest network was applying undue pressure on the provisional government. BSP has publicly criticized the composition of the caretaker cabinet, viewing it as almost exclusively consisting of figures affiliated with GERB, the Reformist Bloc and protest network. The issue has been the cause of media cross-fires between the two main political parties in Bulgaria. Volen Siderov has also suggested that protest network plays a prominent role in the caretaker government.|$|E
25|$|Obama's {{campaign}} to fight global warming found more {{success at the}} international level than in Congress. Obama attended the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, which drafted the non-binding Copenhagen Accord as a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. The deal provided for the monitoring of carbon emissions among developing countries, but it did not include Obama's proposal to commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2050. In 2014, Obama reached an agreement with China in which China pledged to reach peak carbon emission levels by 2030, while the US pledged to cut its emissions by 26-28 percent compared to its 2005 levels. The deal provided momentum for a potential multilateral global warming <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> world's largest carbon emitters. Many Republicans criticized Obama's climate goals as a potential drain on the economy. At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, nearly {{every country in the world}} agreed to a landmark climate deal in which each nation committed lowering their greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement created a universal accounting system for emissions, required each country to monitor its emissions, and required each country to create a plan to reduce its emissions. Several climate negotiators noted that the US-China climate deal and the EPA's emission limits helped make the deal possible. In 2016, the international community agreed to the Kigali accord, an amendment to the Montreal Protocol which sought to reduce the use of HFCs, organic compounds that contribute to global warming.|$|E
25|$|Littleton was {{returned}} unopposed, along with Sir John Wrottesley, 8th Baronet, as MP for Staffordshire on 8 April 1784. The seat was dominated {{at this time}} by the Leveson-Gower family of Trentham Hall. They were traditionally Whigs but Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford had accepted posts in Tory ministries. By general <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> county landed gentry, one candidate should represent the Leveson Gower interest: this was Wrottesley, who {{had served in the}} American Revolutionary War, but returned home to oppose the running of it – essentially Gower's own position. The second seat was for a country member: a gentlemen acceptable to the local landowning interest but essentially uncommitted to party. This was Littleton. In fact, the Earl of Uxbridge had designs on the seat forhis son, Lord Paget, who was still only 16 years old. By proposing Littleton, now in his late 50s, he hoped the seat might become vacant at the next election. In reality, Littleton survived for a further 28 years, holding his seat until his death. Wrottesley, however, died in 1787 and was replaced by Lord Gower, the Marquess's son. Gower was to remain an MP for Staffordshire until 1799, when his half-brother Lord Granville Leveson-Gower took over, holding the seat until 1815. Thus Littleton's colleagues at Westminster were much grander than himself for most of his political career, and in his last years he was largely overawed by them. Because of the tacit agreement about the distribution of seats, all Littleton's elections were uncontested.|$|E

500|$|At this point, Alcibiades's scheme {{encountered}} a great obstacle. Tissaphernes {{would not make}} an agreement on any terms, wanting to follow his policy of neutrality.

Although the envoys were angered at the audacity of the Persian demands, they nevertheless departed with the impression that Alcibiades could have brought about an <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> powers if he had chosen to do so.
