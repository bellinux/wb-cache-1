40|$|Background. Hepatic injury {{secondary}} to warm ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) remains an important clinical issue following liver surgery. The {{aim of this}} prospective, randomized {{study was to determine}} whether steroid administration may reduce liver injury and improve short-term outcome. Patients and methods. Forty-three patients undergoing liver resection were randomized to a steroid group or a control group. Patients in the steroid group received 500 mg of methylprednisolone preoperatively. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate amminotransferase (<b>AST),</b> <b>total</b> bilirubin, anti-thrombin III (AT-III), prothrombin time (PT), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were compared between the two groups. Length of stay and type and number of complications were recorded. Results. Postoperative serum levels of ALT, <b>AST,</b> <b>total</b> bilirubin, and inflammatory cytokines were significantly lower in the steroid group than in controls. The postoperative level of AT-III in the control group was significantly lower than in the steroid group (ANOVA p < 0. 01). The incidence of postoperative complications in the control group tended to be significantly higher than that in the steroid group. Conclusion. These results suggest that steroid pretreatment represents a potentially important biologic modifier of I/R injury and may contribute to maintenance of coagulant/anticoagulant homeostasis...|$|E

40|$|We report {{here the}} use of the {{biochemical}} marker desialylated transferrin to aid in the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Conventional biochemical tests used for the detection of chronic alcohol consumption fail to differentiate nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients from alcoholic subjects. In addition, even in those alcoholic subjects with alcoholic liver disease in whom biopsy has been performed, it is impossible to differentiate these two disease states on the basis of morphological examination alone. In this study we have examined two new markers of excessive alcohol intake, desialylated transferrin and mitochondrial AST in subjects with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and in patients consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. All nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients consumed minimal or no alcohol and were diagnosed by morphological criteria based on liver biopsy specimens. Alcoholic subjects were consuming in excess of 80 gm/day ethanol, often with clinical evidence of overt alcoholism. Control subjects included both healthy controls and patient controls with liver diseases unrelated to alcohol. The ratio of desialylated transferrin/total transferrin was elevated only in patients who consumed excessive amounts of alcohol, whereas the ratio of mitochondrial <b>AST</b> to <b>total</b> <b>AST</b> (mitochondrial AST/total AST) was not significantly different between alcoholic subjects and patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The sensitivity and specificity for the ratio desialylated transferrin/total transferrin was 81 % and 98 %, respectively, whereas the sensitivity for the mitochondrial AST/total AST ratio was 92 %; the specificity was only 50 %, indicating that there were a large number of false-positives. All the conventional markers were less sensitive and less specific than the ratio desialylated transferrin/total transferrin. We conclude {{that it is possible to}} differentiate patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis from patients consuming excessive amounts of alcohol using the biochemical marker desialylated transferrin but not mitochondrial AST. Mitochondrial AST is useful only in those patients with an elevated <b>total</b> <b>AST,</b> whereas desialylated transferrin detects excessive alcohol ingestion whether an elevated AST is present or not.

This study reported that methanol extract and fractions (ethanol and butanol) of S. alata leaves administered orally at 400  mg/kg decreased hepatic enzyme levels (serum ALT, <b>AST,</b> ALP,) <b>total</b> and direct bilirubin, liver TBARS induced by CCl 4 damage. Administration of the methanol extract of this plant showed maintenance of the hepatocytes membrane’s structural integrity [68]. The extract also showed strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory [69], activities which may contribute to its hepatoprotective property.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe present {{investigation}} is aimed {{to evaluate the}} hepatoprotective effects of Citrus hystrix and Citrus maxima (Red and White variety) methanolic leaf extracts on paracetamol induced toxicity. Leaf extracts were given in the dose of 200 mg/kg body weight for 7 days and toxicity was induced by paracetamol (2 g/kg) on day 5. Silymarin (100 mg/kg body weight) was used as reference standard. On the 7 th day animals were sacrificed and liver function markers (ALT, <b>AST,</b> ALP), <b>total</b> bilirubin and total protein in blood serums and hepatic antioxidants (SOD, CAT, GSH and GPx) in liver homogenate were estimated. The leaf extracts restored the liver function markers and hepatic antioxidants to the normal level than elevated levels noticed on paracetamol control at P< 0. 001. Reversal of hepatoarchitecture has also been registered. The present study shows that C. hystrix and C. maxima leaf extracts possess hepatoprotective action against paracetamol induced hepatotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{compare the}} {{laboratory}} data {{and changes in}} these data between patients with MAS and patients with flare-up of the autoimmune diseases. Methods. In a prospective study, the static laboratory data and dynamic changes in the selected data in 17 consecutive patients with MAS and 53 patients with active disease of SJIA, PJIA, Kawasaki disease, and SLE were compared. The ROC curve {{analysis was used to}} evaluate cut-off points, sensitivity, and specificity of the static and dynamic laboratory data to differentiate between MAS and active disease. Results. In the MAS group, the mean CRP 3, ALT, <b>AST,</b> <b>total</b> bilirubin, ferritin, LDH, PT, PTT, and INR were significantly higher and the mean WBC 2, PMN 2, Lymph 2, Hgb 1, 2, 3, ESR 2, serum albumin, and sodium were significantly lower than in control group. Some of the important cut-off points were PLT 2 38. 5, ALT > 38, WBC 5277 [*]ng/mL. Conclusion. The dynamic changes in some laboratory data, especially PLT, can differentiate between MAS and active disease. The changes in WBC, PMN, and ESR and the levels of the liver enzymes may also be helpful in the early differentiation. Very high levels of ferritin may also help the diagnosis along with other clinical and laboratory signs...|$|E
40|$|Background Hyperhomocysteinemia is {{implicated in}} the {{pathogenesis}} of various liver diseases. In this study, the effects of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) on hyperhomocysteinemia and steatosis with ethanol-induced liver injury in rats were examined and their mechanisms were explored. Methods Forty-eight female Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups as control, model, lowdose, and high-dose SAM groups. Except the control group, all rats were fed high-fat-containing diet plus ethanol and fish oil gavaged for 8 weeks. SAM was administered by intraperitoneal injection after the 4 weeks’ exposure of ethanol. Serum homocysteine (Hcy), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (<b>AST),</b> <b>total</b> cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a), and transforming growth factor b 1 (TGF-b 1) levels were determined. The contents of liver malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) were assayed. Liver histology was also examined. The expressions of TNF-a and TGF-b 1 mRNAs in the liver were detected by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. Results Compared with the control group, the model group rats developed marked liver damage, accompanied {{by an increase in}} Hcy, ALT, AST, TC, TG, TNF-a, TGFb 1, and MDA levels. However, the levels of GSH were decreased. These responses were associated with the increased expression of TNF-a and TGF-b 1 mRNAs in the livers, as well as the existence of hepatocellular necrosi...|$|E
40|$|Acute hepatic failure (AHF), {{which leads}} to an {{extremely}} high mortality rate, has {{become the focus of}} attention in clinic. In this study, Danhong injection (DHI) was investigated to evaluate the preventive and protective effect on AHF induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and D-galactosamine (GalN) in mice. For AHF induction, ICR mice were intraperitoneally injected with D-GalN (700 [*]mg/kg) and LPS (20 [*]μg/kg). DHI was administrated twice, at 12 and 1 [*]h, respectively, before D-GalN/LPS injection. After stimulation with D-GalN/LPS for 1 and 6 [*]h, serum and livers were collected for analysis. We found that mice administrated with DHI displayed a higher survival rate, lower serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (<b>AST),</b> <b>total</b> bilirubin (TBil), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α. DHI inhibited the elevations of hepatic lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde), caspase- 8 activity, and mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin- 1 β and interleukin- 6) increased by D-GalN/LPS in the liver. Furthermore, liver histopathological analysis indicated that the DHI group showed markedly fewer apoptotic (TUNEL positive) cells and less pathological changes than those in the AHF model group. These results provide a novel insight into the pharmacological actions of DHI as a potential candidate for treating AHF...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} a paper-based microfluidic device that measures two enzymatic markers of liver function (alkaline phosphatase, ALP, and aspartate aminotransferase, <b>AST)</b> and <b>total</b> serum protein. A device {{consists of four}} components: (i) a top plastic sheet, (ii) a filter membrane, (iii) a patterned paper chip containing the reagents necessary for analysis, and (iv) a bottom plastic sheet. The device performs both the sample preparation (separating blood plasma from erythrocytes) and the assays; it also enables both qualitative and quantitative analysis of data. The data obtained from the paper-microfluidic devices show standard deviations in calibration runs and “spiked ” standards that are acceptable for routine clinical use. This device illustrates a type of test useable {{for a range of}} assays in resource-poor settings. Typical tests conducted to diagnose disease and monitorhealth in patients in industrialized nations are expensive. In resource-poor settings, the requirements of equipped clinica...|$|R
